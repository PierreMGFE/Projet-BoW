REPUBLIC OF KENYA COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY, FY2014-2018
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.
Kenya can be one of Africa’s success stories. It holds great potential including from its
growing and youthful population; dynamic private sector; a platform for change laid down by the
new Constitution and recent peaceful elections; and its pivotal role within East Africa and further
afield. Yet poverty remains high with 4 out of 10 Kenyans living in poverty and the richest 10
percent of the population receiving 40 percent of the nation’s income. Governance concerns
persist; and growth, while solid, has been constrained by low investment and low firm-level
productivity and has yet to take off at the rapid, sustained rates needed to transform the lives of
ordinary citizens.
Progress and Prospects: Diagnostic Review of the Country Context and Development
Agenda.
2.
This strategy is based on a systematic review of evidence to identify the key challenges
and opportunities for Kenya to accelerate progress toward the twin goals. The poverty rate fell
from 47 percent in 2005 to 39 percent based on best estimates in 2012. Some social indicators
have improved notably, yet inequality is high (Gini of 47.4); there are significant differences in
opportunities and outcomes between women and men, for those living in the remote and most
underdeveloped regions, and ethnicity remains an important factor in societal development.
Looking ahead, ending extreme poverty by 2030 would imply a cut in the poverty rate of 2
percentage points each year, likely requiring the economic growth rate to double and inequality
to halve. To unlock rapid and uninterrupted growth that is sustainable and inclusive, Kenya must
address the key binding constraints of low investment and low firm-level productivity. Faster
growth needs significant policy reform to redirect public spending to meet growing infrastructure
needs. It also needs an improved business environment that encourages private sector expansion
and carefully manages the tax burden on business.
Vision: Government Priorities and Medium-term Strategy.
3.
Kenya wants to be a globally competitive and prosperous nation with a high quality of
life. “Vision 2030”, a broad-based agenda straddling the current and previous administration,
rests on three pillars: economic, social, and political. The economic pillar envisages moving up
the value chain in key areas, including agriculture and financial services, to consistently deliver
10 percent annual growth. The social pillar focuses on investing in people, including in
education, health, and housing, and with a focus on women, youth, and vulnerable communities.
The political pillar seeks to “move to the future as one nation,” including improving the rule of
law, transparency, and accountability. Vision 2030 is operationalized by the second MediumTerm Plan (MTP2, 2013-17), and this national agenda is entirely consistent with the Bank
Group’s global timeline targeting an end to extreme poverty. This, together with stakeholder
input gathered in extensive consultations, provides a good anchor for this Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS).
Development Challenges and Opportunities
4.
Against this backdrop, achieving rapid and uninterrupted growth over a decade or more
is the foundational challenge. The Government’s second Medium-Term Plan calls for huge
investments in infrastructure. A key opportunity here is to leverage private sector resources

through innovative public-private partnerships (PPPs), which are currently underdeveloped. To
underpin a sound macroeconomic framework, a renewed effort is merited to help stabilize the
wage bill. A more forceful initiative is needed to improve the business environment, including
tackling some of the deficiencies pinpointed in World Bank Group (WBG) analytical work.
Much of this change agenda will only be possible when relevant, accurate, and timely statistics
are produced to inform policies and help evaluate programs.
5.
Placing a premium on human development is essential from several vantage points.
Growth must be inclusive so that prosperity can be shared by all. From an equity perspective it
cannot be right that maternal mortality is among Africa’s highest at 488 deaths per 100,000 live
births; and many lack access to food security, clean water, good healthcare, and proper housing.
Youth unemployment at 21 percent is double the adult average. Equipping young people with a
modern education and job opportunities is essential to make the most of their talents. Cities must
not only generate economic activity but also provide basic services for those who dwell in them.
And the cohesiveness of Kenyan society calls for renewed efforts to include the marginalized
and disadvantaged. To curb poverty, growth must take place in sectors where the majority of the
poor live. Investment must be redirected to projects closer to the poor, including improving
agricultural productivity in rural areas, expanding and targeting unified social protection
programs that keep people from slipping into poverty, attracting private sector investment and
participation into education, and improving service delivery in health at the local level.
6.
The changing institutional landscape is undergoing a tectonic shift with powers and 30
percent of government revenues moving from the national government to the 47 new county
administrations. This transition is truly historic and few countries have attempted anything on
this scale. The forthcoming challenge is to deliver a “devolution dividend” through greater
citizen engagement, direction, and oversight of public authorities to fundamentally deliver better
services to ordinary people; building new local governmental structures that are responsive and
responsible; and fresh inter-governmental relationships, including resource transfers that
translate policy priorities into meaningful on-the-ground services.
7.
All of these opportunities would be amplified by improved governance and reduced
corruption, or undermined by any deterioration in the prevailing environment. In moving
forward the WBG will be firm in its intolerance for corruption and desire for impunity to end,
while setting expectations sensibly to make step-by-step progress. There are opportunities to
continue improving public financial management, corporate governance standards, openness,
transparency, and accountability in government; and to maintain robust safeguards. Such an
“institution-building” approach will protect not only the integrity of WBG resources but also
Kenya’s internally generated resources that contribute to 90 percent of all public spending.
Strategic Options to Make the Most of the WBG Assets
8.
To help Kenya address these challenges, this CPS draws on a fruitful country relationship
established over several decades and sets out how the combined resources of the Bank, IFC, and
MIGA can best help Kenya fulfill its ambitions of becoming a modern economy in which
growing prosperity is shared across all communities. The Bank will use a “selectivity test” that
deploys a four-pronged benchmark to guide the deployment of scarce resources to maximize the
prospects of success: (a) confirming a credible line of sight to make a sustainable impact on
ii

poverty and prosperity; (b) critically reviewing WBG capability and comparative advantage,
including assessing opportunities for WBG collaboration; (c) cementing client ownership; and
(d) calibrating client capacity and accompanying project design. The selectivity test is used in a
cascading fashion to establish the three domains of engagement, the sectors within each of the
domains, and to make trade-offs between particular operations and analytical advisory activities
(AAA).
9.
The first domain of engagement is competitiveness and sustainability. Improving
infrastructure and the business environment, while being responsive to environmental pressures,
is the backbone of long-term growth. WBG policy advice will help the authorities create a wellfunctioning and properly regulated energy market; IDA financing will be used for some publicly
merited investments; and IFC and MIGA instruments will help leverage more private resources.
More broadly, the Bank Group will redouble its support to public-private partnerships, especially
in the water and transport sectors where there is medium-term potential. On transport, the focus
of new IDA lending will be on significant rural feeder roads within and between counties to
connect communities to emerging economic opportunities. Competitiveness can also be
enhanced through improving the business environment, unleashing the potential of specific
sectors and geographic locations, and ramping up financing sector and capital market
development. The Bank will support the Government’s oversight of the rapidly emerging oil and
gas sector. Both IFC and Bank resources will be deployed to help create private sector jobs and
try to make cities livable and sustainable, with a special focus on secondary cities where poverty
is proving most stubborn.
10.
The second domain of engagement is to protect the vulnerable and help them develop
their potential, which is critical to sharing in prosperity. Social protection plays a pivotal role—
the Bank’s strong engagement will be maintained. Health is also a pressing priority; in this sector
the combined resources of IDA and IFC, alongside global funds and other partners, will be
scaled up. Another key to help target support for the poor is to focus on agriculture, a high
priority since it has such a direct link with helping families in rural areas where a majority of
Kenyans live. Potential IFC investments in infrastructure, agro processing, and financial
institutions further support the goal. The burgeoning youth population brings opportunities and
challenges for WBG support in education, jobs, and skills. Protecting the poor who are
disproportionally impacted by climate variability will also be an area of support. And across the
board the gender focus of WBG operations and analytical work will be upgraded, including
support for female education, entrepreneurship, and rural women’s groups.
11.
The third domain of engagement focuses on building consistency and equity. This is a
really long-term drive that has devolution at its core. The Bank’s large-scale capacity-building
and AAA program will inform a series of IDA operations to help counties and national agencies
to make devolution work. Upon request, the Bank would assemble and manage a Trust Fund
framework to maximize donor coherence in this fluid arena. IDA investments will support a
more evidence-based approach to policymaking, public spending, and public administration
reform. The consistency of Kenya’s development will be buttressed by deepening regional
integration with its neighbors; and WBG investments will be made in multi-country projects,
including in energy and transport.

iii

12.
Individually and collectively the achievement of sustainable development results will
only be possible if they are bound together through a connecting platform of garnering good
governance, which in some ways has been an Achilles heel in the past. The WBG support has at
its heart supply-side capacity building to strengthen oversight institutions, including support for
better public financial management and for more effective institutions of accountability,
combined with demand-side accountability such as the use of open community meetings for
beneficiary engagement. The Bank will continuously review the impact of project-level
governance measures that have been put in place, scaling up those that have been effective,
including drawing on input from the WBG’s Integrity Vice Presidency (INT) on project
safeguards and institutional support to agencies such as the Ethics and Anti-Corruption
Commission (EACC). The WBG will deploy “corruption calibration” to its lending program—
adjusting areas of focus and/or scaling back resources in the event of issues, which threaten the
security of IDA and IFC resource use.
Implementing for Results
13.
The strategy incorporates a results-focus in this CPS and in specific operations and is
flexible in responding to new conditions and information such as updated poverty data in due
course. Targeted outcomes have been articulated in a multi-sector fashion, reflecting the
interdependence of products across the strategy. The Bank Group’s efforts to manage for results
across the country program are built on country systems and capabilities for measuring and
monitoring progress. Collaboration across the Bank Group and with other partners will be
purpose driven in specific areas such as business climate, financial sector, public-private
partnerships, energy, and agriculture. The selectivity test is already pushing the Bank Group to
expand in some fields—such as supporting secondary cities, promoting rural development and
devolution—and tapering Bank involvement in others such as highways, natural resource
management, and legal reform. This process is dynamic, and the assessment will be continuously
updated.
14.
The WBG could be providing over US$1 billion per year to Kenya over the life of this
CPS. Careful portfolio management will continue to be an important ingredient of the drive for
results—with tailored approaches to suit the particular circumstances of Bank, IFC, and MIGA
investments. IFC is targeting portfolio expansion perhaps even beyond the US$785 million of
commitments at mid-FY14 if market conditions permit. MIGA’s current total exposure to Kenya
is US$255 million, and international investors’ interest in infrastructure, power, and agribusiness sectors provides potential for this to expand further. The Bank’s annual commitments
will be governed by the IDA17 settlement, provisionally assumed at around US$600 million
each year. This will build on the IDA portfolio in Kenya of US$4.3 billion at mid-FY14,
covering 23 national projects (US$3.5 billion) and 7 regional projects in which Kenya is a
partner (US$0.8 billion). It is important to continue to “move to scale” especially in IDA
investments, but also in IFC commitments, by focusing on larger projects and the judicious use
of additional finance.
Managing Risks
15.
Any instability in the macroeconomic environment would probably be the single most
damaging factor to overall poverty prospects. The mitigation strategy revolves around the longiv

term drive to improve competitiveness and exports, combined with a prudent strategy on reserves
and international capital access to cope with potential volatility. Disasters and insecurity, natural
or man-made, can be expected to occur even though their timing and severity typically cannot be
predicted; and the Bank Group and its partners will seek ways to help cope with such risks in the
future. Other strategic risks include unexpected changes in political leadership, policy direction
and ministerial leads in key sectors, funding priorities of other donors, or a loss of appetite of
strategic partners for IFC- and MIGA-supported deals. Each of these would require nimble reengagement to prevent changes unduly affecting the WBG-supported program. Finally,
operational risks include a worsening of the governance and corruption environment, including
in new county administrations as their activities expand. The mitigating measures include (a) the
thrust of this CPS to help garner good governance, including as part of the devolution process;
(b) active cooperation between INT, the Bank, and the authorities in order that preventive
measures are built into project design, and allegations when received are handled firmly and
decisively; and (c) good communication with stakeholders, including the Board, so due
proportionality can be applied in any strategic response needed by the Bank.

REPUBLIC OF KENYA COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY, FY2014-2018
1.
Kenya can be one of Africa’s success stories. Its outlook is one of hope and positive
prospects, with huge development opportunities combined with substantial challenges. It
holds great potential including from its expanding and youthful population; dynamic private
sector; a platform for change laid down by the new Constitution and recent peaceful elections;
and its pivotal role within East Africa and further afield. Yet Kenya’s poverty rate remains high
and governance concerns persist. Growth, while solid, has been constrained by low investment
and low firm-level productivity and has yet to take off at the rapid, sustained rates needed to
transform the lives of ordinary citizens. This World Bank Group (WBG) Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) draws on a fruitful relationship established over several decades. It sets out how
the combined resources of the World Bank, IFC, and MIGA can, in line with the WBG’s twin
goals—eliminating extreme poverty by 2030 and boosting shared prosperity—best help Kenya
rapidly reduce poverty and fulfill its ambitions of becoming a modern economy in which
growing prosperity is shared across all communities.

A.

PROGRESS AND PROSPECTS: A DIAGNOSTIC REVIEW OF COUNTRY
CONTEXT AND DEVELOPMENT AGENDA
Trends in Poverty and Shared Prosperity

2.
This CPS is based on a systematic review of evidence from within and outside the
WBG as well as an extensive consultation process. The analytical approach has drawn upon
the emerging principles that guide the new systematic country diagnostic (SCD) approach. A
formal systematic country diagnostic document would be premature at this point and hence has
not been developed. A wide range of perspectives and input from Kenyan counterparts
complements the analysis. The consultations, which were conducted in various locations across
the country, included representatives from national government, county governments, the private
sector, including business leaders, non-governmental organizations (NGOs); development
partners; and respected Kenyan development practitioners.
3.
Poverty reduction is clearly the single most pressing issue and while Kenya’s
poverty rate has been falling—from 47 percent in 2005/06 to about 39 percent based on
best estimates in 2012/13—several formidable challenges lie ahead. There is a pressing need
to solidify estimates with more recent data since Kenya’s last household budget survey was in
2005/6. The Government intends to conduct a new survey in 2014, and the Bank is supporting
such plans. Poverty reduction has been driven by solid growth across most of the economy,
together with some improvements in social safety nets targeting the poor and continuing
migration to urban areas—especially metropolitan Nairobi—that offer better job prospects (albeit
largely in the informal sector) as well as easier access to health and education services. The
distribution of the nearly 4 in every 10 Kenyans living in extreme poverty—“Kenya’s bottom
40”—is by no means even, most notably with a growing rural-urban split that needs action on
both sides. In the remote, arid, sparsely populated north-eastern parts of the country (Turkana,
Mandera, and Wajir), poverty rates are above 80 percent; agro-climatic shocks impact vulnerable
livelihoods that depend on livestock and low-productivity agricultural activities; and people’s
assets, including educational opportunity and achievement, are very limited. The populations in

the western and coastal parts of the country benefit from better natural resource endowments; but
the poor remain especially prone to contracting insect and water-borne diseases, and agricultural
potential has been limited by the effects of flood-induced, land degradation in certain rural areas.
4.
Tackling poverty must address both the difficulties of low-income, rural
communities and the distinct problems of urban poverty that also encompasses secondary
cities. The proportion of Kenya’s poor that live in major cities other than Nairobi has increased
from 17 to 22 percent over the past decade, suggesting that economic growth in these urban
settlements was unable to absorb the population growth. And even though the poverty rate of 22
percent in Nairobi has been falling and is low compared to the rest of the country, the absolute
numbers of poor and their concentration in informal settlements remains high. Across the
country women tend to fare less well than men in many dimensions, including being much less
likely to find a job in the formal labor market and earning lower wages when they do. Women in
rural areas have less access to income-producing assets such as land and credit, and receive
lower incomes for comparable farm work in rural areas. Poverty is also more prevalent among
large households (the poorest families have 5.2 members compared to 3.5 members in more
well-off households).
5.
Income inequality levels are not likely to have decreased in recent years, and
achieving inclusive growth remains a development objective. Kenya’s Gini coefficient of
47.7 is above that of neighboring comparators, including Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Uganda. The
richest 10 percent of the population garner 40 percent of the nation’s income, whereas the
poorest 10 percent receive only 2 percent of national income. There is domestic interest in
addressing this challenge and the WBG support to promote shared prosperity meets with a warm
reception. While fostering income growth of the bottom 40 is not currently a target set explicitly
by the national authorities, in practice it is currently equivalent to fostering income growth of the
extreme poor. The WBG team is working with the authorities on this challenge, in an effort to
convey the importance of securing a reduction in inequality as one step toward ensuring that
attainable growth can meet the overarching target to end poverty in a generation.
6.
Significant investment and economic reform must be part of the effort to cut the
poverty rate by 2 percentage points each year from now to 2030 if extreme poverty is to be
ended in that timeframe. Simulations—which will be refined once more up-to-date poverty
statistics become available with Bank support in 2015—show that both the pace and extent to
which economic growth is inclusive will have a major influence on the poverty outlook (see
Annex 7). Eliminating poverty by 2030 in Kenya is beset by two formidable challenges: the rate
of economic growth would need to double; and inequality, measured by the Gini coefficient,
would need to be halved. If growth remains at historic levels of around 4 percent per year and
inequality remains unchanged, poverty rate will fall to 35 percent by 2018 and to 27 percent by
2030, as shown in Table 1. The progress in poverty reduction depends strongly on what happens
to inequality in the country. If inequality falls each year by one percentage point, with a GDP
growth rate of 4 percent, the poverty rate would fall to 28 percent by 2018 and to 11 percent by
2030. Under this inequality reduction scenario, the goal of eliminating extreme poverty is
attainable if annual GDP growth rates increase to 6 percent. However, if inequality worsens this
goal would not be tenable in the medium term.

baseline fertility rates.

7.
Beyond the poverty data, it is also important to account for non-income dimensions
of well-being. Kenya has met the targets of relatively few Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) as analyzed in Annex 7. The recent UN report on the post-2015 development agenda
has drawn attention to how factors beyond the direct poverty metric need coordinated
international support.2 In Kenya, some social indicators have improved: notably falling
children’s mortality (from 102 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2000 to 73 in 2012),3 nearuniversal primary school enrolment, and narrowing gender gaps in education. Some
improvements have been secured through well-targeted interventions such as the extensive
deployment of insecticide-treated bed nets to guard against malaria, and increased public
spending (albeit not typically used efficiently) on lower-level education. While prevalence of
HIV/AIDS has been ameliorated thus meeting the targeted MDG, it is still a pressing issue for
certain segments of the population. But other indicators remain stubbornly vexing. Secondary
school enrolments are at a low 32 percent, and learning achievement levels are well below their
potential and what is needed to fuel a modern market economy. And maternal mortality is among
the highest in Africa with 488 deaths per 100,000 live births. This prompted an immediate policy
response by the new Government to provide maternal health care for free at all public health
facilities.
8.
There is also an important “jobs lens” through which to view people’s sense of
engagement in and benefit from the country’s development. Kenyans rate “tackling
unemployment” as a top priority for the Government, which in fact has set an ambitious target of
creating 1 million new jobs annually. Within this target there is a special need for jobs for the
growing youth cohort; each year more and more young people are graduating from school and
college and facing a rather despondent task of finding work. Kenya needs an acceleration of
structural change that creates more high-productivity (modern) jobs in the formal sector
(currently accounting for 1 in 7 jobs). Yet, it must also help grow jobs and improve conditions in
the informal sector, not least in the family farm and off-farm sectors in which nearly half of all
Kenyans work.
9.
Enabling people to realize their potential and lifting them out of poverty involves, at
the most basic level ensuring that they are healthy, educated, and have basic life skills to be
able to participate in social and economic life. This is part of a broader drive to solidify the
nation’s social capital, which has been enhanced by the widespread support for the new
Constitution adopted in 2010, and the free, fair, and peaceful elections in 2013. The tragic
terrorist atrocities in Nairobi, however, serve as a reminder of the importance of domestic
security in all its facets, including curbing crime across-the-board and upholding the rule of law.

B.

Drivers and Constraints of Economic Growth

10.
GDP growth has played the main role in reducing poverty, but the average rate of
4.6 percent annually over the last decade is not sufficient to end extreme poverty by 2030.
On the positive side, for the first time in a generation Kenya avoided an “election disruption” to
growth in 2013, helped by the new Constitution adopted in 2010 that set the platform for
peaceful elections. It has drawn on its strong track record in economic management (its 3.9
rating in the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment was Africa’s highest in 2012 as well as
a prudent debt position). It has a vibrant private sector and financial services industry; and IFC
increased the number of transactions per year by a factor of 4 between FY09 and FY13. The
country also has regionally important assets, including a financial sector hub, port, and airport.
All of this has delivered decent growth; but, on a per capita basis, as Figures 1 and 2 show, it is
trailing behind Kenya’s peers.

11.
What has held back growth? Kenya has been hampered by low investment and low
productivity that in turn clog the “export engine”. There has been a weak contribution of
capital stock to GDP growth as shown in Figure 2. Private sector investment, at around 15
percent of GDP, is below that of competitors; and foreign direct investment at 1 percent of GDP
in recent years is far below what could be achieved (e.g., Tanzania and Uganda attract foreign
direct investment of about 5 percent of GDP). Public investment has also been constrained. That
4

is not principally because of inherently inadequate funding considering Kenya collects revenue
of around 24 percent of GDP annually—a leader in Africa. That strong performance has been
driven by progress in economic policy and reform, including the review and update of the Value
Added Tax (VAT) Law, supported by the US$750 million IMF External Credit Facility (ECF),
which was completed successfully in December 2013. Rather a significant share of the tax
revenue has to be deployed on a substantial public sector wage bill that is high by international
standards. This means that while public sector development expenditure has edged up over the
past decade, it is constantly under pressure and needs more room to increase.
12.
Low productivity, and low returns that constrain private investment persist for
several reasons. First, essential infrastructure services such as energy and transportation are too
costly and inadequately supplied. Second, the environment for doing business, where Kenya
notably lags its competitors, has weaknesses, including governance and corruption challenges,
and regulatory frameworks, which in some cases are not well enforced and in other cases are too
burdensome. Third, human capital has been improving and is relatively good compared to many
other low-income countries in Africa, but still many firms—especially those competing on
international markets—cannot secure the workforce to drive their growth. And fourth, limited
access to finance often with overbearing requirements for collateral (e.g., for rural businesses),
means companies in arid counties and small entrepreneurs are not grasping many growth
opportunities. This is part of the broader challenge for the economy to mobilize domestic savings
to direct toward investment needs. Many of these issues can be addressed at least in part by
policy and market reforms, emulating some of the positive steps, such as trade reform and energy
market liberalization that Kenya has taken in earlier years. Good clear laws backed by a strong
and credible judiciary are an essential element in creating an environment that is conducive to
business and financial activity to promote credit to a wider population.
13.
To unlock rapid and uninterrupted growth that is sustainable and inclusive, the
WBG will continue to address significant binding constraints of low investment and low
firm-level productivity. The Government has been committed to fiscal discipline and the
primary budget balance of the central government has remained at reasonable levels. The
authorities seek to re-orient fiscal policy to providing infrastructure investment that lowers the
cost of doing business. In addition the Government targets improving the business climate—part
of which involves pursuing a careful tax policy that removes distortions and avoids undue
burdens on private enterprise that could stifle entrepreneurship. Spending at national- and
county-level government falls under the Public Financial Management (PFM) Law and within
the Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS), which should limit the risk
of overspending and emphasize lowering non-priority outlays.
14.
Kenya’s public sector debt remained sustainable with low risk of distress. Overall,
fiscal policy and borrowing decisions remained in line over the medium-term plans and its debt
management strategy. Kenya’s external debt has remained sustainable, largely on account of
prudent borrowing on non-concessional terms while Government guarantees were limited to
energy-related projects. According to the 2013 Debt Sustainability Assessment, the Eurobond
issuance planned for the first half of 2014 does not change the favorable conclusions of Kenya’s
external and public debt position. Going forward, Kenya has planned a fiscal consolidation path
of achieving a net public debt ratio of about 40 percent in 2017/18 and a deficit of 3 percent
meeting the fiscal convergence criteria of the East African Community (EAC) Monetary Union
much earlier than 2024.
5

15.
Appropriate monetary policy has kept inflation within the Central Bank of Kenya
(CBK) target range (5, ± 2½, percent) for more than one year while the banking sector has
built adequate capital buffers. Average inflation in 2013 was 5.4 percent compared to 9.4
percent in 2012 and 14.0 percent in 2011. After the policy mishap in 2011, the Central Bank
adopted a prudent approach by keeping its policy rate constant at 8.5 percent since mid-2012. In
the banking sector, banks are implementing enhanced CBK-prudential guidelines in advance of
the end-2014 deadlines. Kenyan commercial banks are increasing their capital adequacy buffers
in line with individual banks’ risk profiles, adopting more stringent provisioning requirement for
non-performing loans and introducing contingency liquidity provisions into their planning in
response to revised CBK-prudential guidelines.
16.
Kenya’s external position has substantially strengthened. The high current account
deficit that has afflicted Kenya since 2005 and exposed its external vulnerability abated in 2013
to 8.4 percent of GDP due to tight fiscal and monetary policies, good weather, and improving
exports of financial services. This also happened in an environment of a substantial increase in
capital-goods imports emanating from foreign direct investment in oil-exploration equipment.
Capital inflows and the participation of foreign investors in domestic bond markets have
increased, attracted by high domestic interest rates and a stable exchange rate reflecting strong
foreign investors’ interest in Kenya’s stock market and increased appetite for medium-term
government securities. In addition Kenya has succeeded in building up international reserve
buffers to above US$6.6 billion around 4.5 months of projected imports despite a large
deterioration of the terms of trade. The strong external position has increasingly supported the
shilling; improved public debt sustainability has placed the government in a more comfortable
position to access international capital markets.
17.
Several sectors have performed particularly well, including high-value horticulture,
tea, tourism, financial services, and emerging ICT—key ingredients in the modernization
of Kenya’s economy. Consistent with this performance, the IFC has been able to step up
financial investments dramatically—reaching about US$167 million of new business in FY13
and US$330 million in FY12. Kenya’s faster growth has gained momentum by its rapidly
growing working-age population, cities reaching significant scale to reap agglomeration gains,
and the rising predominance of “modern” sectors. For example, Kenya’s M-Pesa, the global
leader in mobile money transfer systems, reaches more than 23 million subscribers or more than
half of the population, and illustrates the power of innovation to make a dramatic change in
people’s lives. Still, foreign direct investment is limited, exports lag behind imports (a structural
trade deficit that reflects weak competitiveness), and the private sector struggles to create one
million new jobs needed each year for the country’s growing labor force. Infrastructure needs are
pressing, firm-level productivity is low, and weak governance and a poor business regulatory
environment (the Doing Business rating dropped from 72nd place in 2007 to 129th place in 2014)
stifles growth and entrepreneurship and holds back the effectiveness of some public spending.
18.
So what is Kenya’s economic outlook? Can its growth accelerate and be maintained
at a higher level? Yes, but it is a tall order. The fact that historic growth of just under 5 percent
per annum was below potential and below that of the country’s peers is a good sign in so far as it
shows there is room to improve. But it also shows that a significant agenda of policy reform and
targeted investment is needed to accelerate economic performance across the board. The 2013
WBG report, “Achieving Shared Prosperity in Kenya,” sets out systematically where there is
considerable scope for change involving policy and institutional reforms and greater private
6

sector participation in key challenges. The country’s manufacturing base is small and as a share
of GDP (around 10 percent) has hardly risen in decades—whereas if Kenya were to emulate the
success of global growth leaders among developing economies, manufacturing would have to
expand dramatically. Improvements are also needed in the operations of the Port of Mombasa; in
reform of agriculture, especially agricultural purchasing (the National Cereals and Produce
Board); and in greater efficiency in public services. How far and how fast those types of
adjustments take place will influence growth prospects along with global economic conditions
and domestic macroeconomic policy. The Bank’s central estimates (see Table 2) for the CPS
period anticipate inflation being controlled and growth averaging about 6 percent per annum.
More rapid growth is of course possible, and the WBG will work with the Government, the
private sector, and other partners with exactly that aim.

Sustainability

19.
Accelerated growth will have sustainability implications. When the country won its
independence in 1963, its population was under 9 million and the pressure on natural resources
(and human/animal conflict) was relatively modest. Now 50 years later, there are more than 43
million residents, and the population is projected to grow by around 1 million per year over the
coming 40 years, to be the world’s 20th most populous nation by 2050 (compared to 31st today).
Although high fertility rates were the main driver in previous decades, these are now falling as
incomes rise and family planning has become more prevalent.
20.
Managing population growth, both its scale and impact, remains a significant
challenge. A majority of Kenyans do not have reliable access to clean water and good sanitation.
In rural areas women typically bear the brunt of life-sustaining household chores such as fetching
water and firewood; this becomes even more challenging without sustainable land management
practices. In the fast-growing cities (where in fact fertility rates are typically lower than rural
7

areas, which may lessen population growth somewhat over the longer term), the task of
providing housing, proper waste and pollution management, and security is increasingly
complex. Proper spatial planning and effective urban policies are essential if migration from the
countryside to the city is really to improve people’s lives over the long term.
21.
Overall the Millennium Development Goal on sustainability (MDG 7) is seriously
off-track. This is true for several other MDG targets (see Annex 7). Kenya is vulnerable to
natural disasters and other climate-related impacts; droughts brought hardship and costs of
US$12 billion over the last decade. Kenya is classified as “chronically water scarce” with one of
the most degraded areas in the region; about 70 percent of the population lives in the small share
(about 12 percent) of the country’s total land area that has agricultural potential. The growing
population and the resulting increase in demand for land, energy, and water is putting
tremendous pressure on the natural resource base. These concerns are reinforced given that
Kenya’s natural assets—landscape and wildlife—are important for the population as a whole, for
some specific indigenous groups whose livelihoods and culture are so tied up with the land, and
for the pivotal position they play in the nation’s tourism industry (which accounts for 2 percent
of GDP and 15 percent of export earnings).
22.
Land issues are contentious and need to be approached carefully by all interested
parties. The Constitution puts emphasis on land and the environment, including aiming to
achieve and maintain tree cover of at least 10 percent of Kenya’s land area. The National
Climate Change Action Plan (NCCAP) has identified restoration of forests on degraded lands
and agroforestry as a ‘big win’ opportunity. Yet the challenge is to develop and sensitively
implement win-win solutions that properly handle the rights and position of indigenous peoples,
including those whose long-standing place of abode is in forest areas.
23.
Kenya’s fiscal sustainability over the coming years has reasonably secure prospects
based on Kenya’s track record to date. Policymakers would be loath to lose the hard-won
gains from prudent macroeconomic policy. The potential Achilles heel is the public sector wage
bill, which at over 50 percent of recurrent spending (compared to Sub-Saharan African average
of 30-35 percent) and upwards of 7 percent of GDP is higher than many comparators. It is
constantly under pressure especially now that account must be taken of former local authority
staff salaries being absorbed by county governments and national civil servants whose functions
have been devolved but are still on the government payroll. The move to devolution should not
in and of itself raise public spending, but some policymakers especially at the county level may
“turn on the spending taps.” It will therefore be important that public financial management is
strengthened, unnecessary or unplanned contingent fiscal liabilities are avoided, and fiscal
responsibility is followed as required by the Public Financial Management Act 2012.
24.
Social cohesion requires renewed attention to equitable access to opportunities for
all regions and communities, youth, and women as part of the Government’s ambition for
“unity” to ensure all groups have a proper share in Kenya’s future. The 2010 Constitution
was a major step forward on women’s rights and provides that at least 30 percent of all
appointees to public bodies are female, including at the county level. However, there is a long
way to go to ensure that women are economically empowered and can fully develop their
potential (see Annex 12). In agriculture, women comprise more than 70 percent of the labor
force, yet they own only 1-5 percent of agricultural land titles. In terms of non-agricultural
employment, only 29 percent of those earning a formal wage are women and female youths are
8

twice as likely to be unemployed as adult females. Girls are also less likely than boys to enroll in
secondary schools (female-male secondary enrollment ratio of 92 percent) and are more likely to
drop out due to unfriendly school environments, early marriages, and the high cost of secondary
schooling. Maternal mortality is one of the highest in Africa at 488 deaths per 100,000 live births
and the proportion of women who receive child delivery with skilled attendance is only 44
percent and has remained unchanged over the last 10 years.
25.
To strengthen advancement of Kenya’s women, this CPS has been informed by key
gender analyses. These analyses include a recently conducted gender portfolio review and a
poverty and inequality assessment (see Annex 12). In addition, given that the last gender
assessment predates gender-relevant provisions in the 2010 Constitution, the Bank will undertake
a Joint Poverty and Gender Assessment targeted for FY15 that will directly inform the Kenya
country program and ensure that activities are guided by the most accurate and up-to-date gender
analysis (Box 1). Finally, support for setting, collecting, and monitoring sex-disaggregated data
is planned in response to a lack of gender-disaggregated data.
Box 1: Gender Focus: Enabling Women to Help Themselves, their Families, and their
Country
Inclusion of women fully in Kenya’s development is sensible from its intrinsic value of equal rights and its
support for faster economic growth by helping all citizens, male and female, to achieve their greatest
potential. The current development context in Kenya – devolution, the Constitution, and other policy reforms –
offers compelling opportunities to advance these values. With the adoption of the new Constitution, women and men
now formally have the right to equal treatment and opportunities in political, economic, cultural and social spheres
without discrimination. The Constitution provides that not more than two-thirds of members of elective public
bodies be of the same sex and also provides for numerous other rights for women, including those related to
citizenship, marriage/divorce, land, and public service opportunities. However, there is still progress to be made in
ensuring that women are able to realize these rights in practice.
The WBG, through the IDA portfolio, IFC investments, and analytical work is supporting key gender issues.
A recent gender portfolio review estimated that 76 percent of active and pipeline IDA operations are gender
informed. The current strategy builds on the previous CAS period that saw a focus on gender issues in agriculture,
health, education, and social protection, with proposed indicators for each of these areas. WBG support has helped
generate tangible results: a 10 percent increase in incomes for both female and male small-holder farmers; the
provision of basic health, nutrition, and population services to over 21 million women; employment for 40 percent
of interns benefiting from the Youth Empowerment Project (both female and male); and the provision of cash
transfers to 56,000 orphan and vulnerable children households. The IFC SME Banking Advisory Program improves
the availability of financial services to women by training commercial bank staff and supporting specific products
aimed at women. The current CPS results framework includes gender-related outcome indicators in health services
and water (see Outcome 5 in Annex 1, CPS Results Framework).

26.
How well Kenya’s youth fare in the coming years will also have a significant bearing
on social cohesion. On the positive side there is a huge demographic dividend whereby some 26
million Kenyans (more than one-half the population) are below age 25, and this ratio will rise to
almost two-thirds by 2030. More broadly it is economically productive adults (15-64 years) that
are the fastest growing cohort, yielding a massive improvement in the dependency ratio over the
coming decades (Figure 3). If these citizens—especially the young—are equipped with the skills
and competencies for the changing marketplace and secure gainful work, they will provide a
huge boost to productivity and output. But if too many of them fall from this path, there is a risk
of social capital being undermined by crime and delinquency. That is why it is so important for
the private sector to create jobs and for young people to continue their education and acquire
skills to fit those jobs.

D.

Institutions and Governance

27.
The institutional and governance environment plays a part in the nation’s
performance and how the WBG program unfolds. Kenya has a mixed record on governance
performance, falling below the average for SSA countries in the World Governance Indicators,
except in government effectiveness and regulatory quality (see Annex 9 for an overview of
governance issues). Ratings in surveys such as those from Transparency International (where
Kenya was rated 139 out of 174 countries in 2012) and extensive media coverage of governance
and corruption justifiably draw attention to the issue. Likewise for the WBG, there is emphasis
on tackling these issues, including taking measures to safeguard the use of WBG funds in
projects, where deepened collaboration between the Bank’s Department of Institutional Integrity
(INT) and the Kenya National Audit Office has proven fruitful. The WBG has addressed the
after-effects of somewhat contentious experiences with past (and closed) projects (that dealt with
education and arid lands) where referrals have been made to the Ethics and Anti-Corruption
Commission (EACC).
28.
It would be wrong to paint too gloomy a picture of governance problems. But
realistically, the governance analysis in this CPS shows that these problems have deep-rooted
causes in accountability (or lack thereof), including vested interests, elite capture, and
weaknesses in institutions of accountability that encompass the legal and judicial system and
enforcement agencies. But in some respects it is the vibrancy, openness, and international
connectivity of the media and civil society in Kenya that bring these issues to the attention of a
much wider audience than perhaps is experienced by other countries with similar patterns of
corruption. Many businesses do operate effectively; for example, IFC has been able to expand its
business without governance issues grinding things to a halt. The country has an almost
unparalleled openness among its peers in making public appointments, including Cabinet
ministers, senior civil servants, and vetting of judges when replacement is necessary. A
strengthened Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) and more creative and extensive
use of technology can increasingly provide “sunshine” transparency (of public oversight) on
public spending and other aspects of official public life. The 2010 Constitution has strengthened
existing institutions and created new ones for oversight, including the Controller of Budget (who
authorizes release of funds and is appointed on an eight-year, non-renewable tenure) and a
reforming and independent Judiciary.

10

29.
Devolution in Kenya is a huge change in the institutional landscape. The 2010
Constitution provided for the creation in 2013 of 47 new county governments with considerable
oversight of affairs in their jurisdictions (see Annex 10 for the challenges and opportunities of
devolution). If implemented successfully, it can, over the long term have a positive impact on
governance and the promotion of shared prosperity. By bringing government closer to the people
and enhancing local-level accountability mechanisms, governance can be improved; this will not
happen automatically but rather requires specific actions, including establishing strong public
financial management and budget transparency within county administrations. By improving and
better targeting service delivery (such as education, core public services, local infrastructure) at
the county level, local citizens and companies will benefit. There is considerable variation in
capacity and resources among the counties, which will take a concerted effort to address. The
new structures provide an avenue for a clearer and more equitable allocation of national
resources across counties, which should help less-developed regions.

E.

Regional Dimensions

30.
The country diagnostic would not be complete without recognition of the distinctive
position Kenya holds in East Africa. The country is a leader and connector within the East
African Community (EAC), not least through its facilitation of regional trade, investment, and
flow of skills across borders. But for it to become an economic powerhouse, Kenya must tackle
key obstacles, among which is remedying major transport corridors, including border crossings
that remain tortuous and hold back growth in neighboring countries (which in turn would benefit
Kenya). Solidifying peace and security right across the Horn of Africa will also be of mutual
benefit for Kenya and its neighbors. The new Government has affirmed its regional credentials,
according considerable importance to cross-country collaboration as a way to promote economic
development and security. President Kenyatta has formed active alliances with his counterparts
to push forward specific initiatives, including transport connectivity, and to harmonize financial
sector frameworks and infrastructure in the EAC. These last two initiatives are supported by the
Bank’s regional (multi-country) portfolio that has expanded considerably, albeit with growing
pains (slow start up and disbursement). IFC clients and sponsors are increasingly being sourced
from within Africa as well as among its global network. Some Kenyan enterprises such as those
in financial services have made significant cross-border investments facilitated by IFC
engagements. There is therefore potential to do more on regional issues; and while the
transformative effect can be substantial over the long term, the costs and difficulties in delivering
this must not be underestimated.

II

VISION AND FRAMEWORK: GOVERNMENT PRIORITIES AND MEDIUM-TERM
STRATEGY

31.
By 2030 Kenya wants to be a globally competitive and prosperous nation with a
high quality of life for its citizens. This clear ambition is encapsulated in “Vision 2030”, a
broad-based agenda straddling the current and previous administrations. The Vision provides a
framework for this CPS. It rests on three pillars: economic, social, and political. The economic
pillar envisages creating a modern economy by moving up the value chain in key areas,
including agriculture and financial services, to consistently deliver 10 percent annual growth.
The social pillar focuses on investing in people, including in education, health, and housing, with

11

a focus on women, youth, and vulnerable communities. The political pillar seeks to “move to the
future as one nation,” including improving the rule of law, transparency, and accountability.
32.
Vision 2030 is operationalized by the Medium-Term Plan (MTP), which drives
policy actions, public investment priorities, and expenditure planning. Its second edition,
MTP2 (2013-17)—“Transforming Kenya”— was launched by the new administration in October
2013. It is clear that MTP2 is a sensible anchor for a good deal of the WBG work, including
how IDA, IFC, and MIGA investments help leverage job creation. But WBG will need to have
its own approach to selectivity in the deployment of its resources since it cannot match the
appropriate comprehensiveness of the MTP2. The MTP2 and the Vision 2030 results framework
provide a good anchor for the CPS to ensure solid monitoring of results of Bank-supported
interventions with a clear line of sight to longer-term development results.
33.
Overall this national agenda is entirely consistent with the WBG aspirations. The
global timeline targeting an end to extreme poverty is aligned with Kenya’s overall approach.
Although the country has not explicitly proposed monitoring the growth in incomes of the
bottom 40 percent (who are in fact those currently living below the poverty line), this focus
resonates with the thrust of the domestic strategy. Policymakers are concerned—including for
reasons of societal cohesion—and want to ensure that all groups share in advancing prosperity.
And within the population, they have highlighted several segments, including the prospects for
women and the rapidly growing youth cohort.
34.
It is important to enrich the understanding of this national vision with other sources
of views from key stakeholders in Kenya’s development. For this reason the CPS has been
informed by client and stakeholder views summarized in Annex 13. Dialogues and meetings with
national and county governments have been held in various locations across the country. In many
respects their views were consonant with the country’s broad vision while providing additional
insights into particular points of emphasis such as how to deliver “One Kenya” for women and
men alike; dealing with the special challenges of youth; recognizing the intricate features of
governance; and liberating the dynamism of the private sector, including by sensible tax policy at
national and county level that avoids excessive or distortionary burdens on firms. Other feedback
emphasized the issue of making devolution work, ensuring that WBG support helped as many
counties as possible, especially those communities in the greatest need, and finding new methods
of working with the counties.

III

DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES

35.
Some of Kenya’s challenges are not new, and many exist similarly in other WBG
client countries. Yet there are certain distinctive features that have been identified in the
systematic diagnosis of key constraints and opportunities relevant to the CPS timeframe. Those
distinctive features provide one thrust (but not the only criteria) that accounts for how this CPS
implements a selective approach to how the WBG deploys its resources going forward.
36.
Kenya’s newly elected Government has a change mandate from an impatient
citizenry, yet arguably with no diminution of the clientilism and interest group pressures
that have influenced politics and business for decades. There is potential within a burgeoning
private sector, including the most effective of operations in fields as diverse as horticulture,
tourism, power generation and transmission, and signs of significant new resources in the

extractive industries sector. Financial services innovations are particularly impressive, such as
M-Pesa that leads the world in “mobile money for ordinary citizens,” and in deepening stock
exchange and capital markets. There are openings for Kenya to punch at a higher weight in
regional East African Community activity—both in the public and private sectors.
37.
The new Constitution provides opportunities to implement major shifts in Kenya’s
institutions to improve how they serve the public. With broad public support, the Constitution
intends to accelerate development outcomes, reduce spatial inequality, and strengthen
governance. Several key changes that it heralds are significant (Box 2) and set the scene for
shaping how WBG input can help embed these changes over the coming year.
Box 2: A 50th Birthday Present: How the Constitution Opens New Doors for Kenya
Kenya’s original Constitution adopted upon independence in 1963 provided a degree of stability in the subsequent
decades, but its weaknesses in serving a modernizing and ambitious Kenya were becoming more apparent as time
passed. The 2010 Constitution establishes significant new provisions in several areas including gender equality
(where women are achieving fairer representation in elected chambers and executive positions, although there is still
a fair way to go) and governance and the rule of law (where anti-corruption agencies are empowered more solidly).
To improve public administration broadly, changes include a strengthened legislature and new senate; initial reforms
in the judiciary; increased emphasis on transparency, participation, and accountability; and an ambitious devolution
that transfers significant resources and responsibilities to 47 newly elected county governors and county assemblies.
The March 2013 elections allowed the implementation phase to begin in earnest—an immense task of converting
Constitutional provisions and laws into functioning institutions. The first steps in this daunting journey have been
positive: election process issues are being resolved in court; public vetting of key leadership positions, especially in
the judiciary, has increased; and devolution has largely proceeded according to Constitutional timetables, albeit with
fits and starts.

38.
Against this backdrop, achieving rapid and uninterrupted growth over a decade or
more is the foundational challenge. Based on this diagnostic review in Kenya, there are
prospects for maintaining a sound macroeconomic framework that needs, in part, prudent control
of the public sector wage bill; but, this is linked with wider issues of equity and public service
efficiency. The Salary and Remuneration Commission is in the forefront of trying to resolve
wage demands in the public sector. How this Commission resolves labor disputes and helps
stabilize the wage bill will be a test of fiscal resoluteness. At the same time, Bank-supported
analysis of the delivery of public services has pinpointed glaring deficiencies in the way
resources are deployed such as a troubling number of teachers failing to be present in the
classroom for the equivalent of two days per week. All this points to public sector modernization
as a continuing area of emphasis.
39.
The long-term economic engine is the private sector—including the large segment of
informal activity—whose energy and dynamism should be the principal source of growth
and where there are significant opportunities. As part of its day-to-day business, the IFC has
seen that several important sectors are attractive in their ability to create jobs, make an impact on
poverty, and be commercially viable. These sectors include financial services, infrastructure,
ICT, education, agriculture and food processing, and manufacturing. All these sectors are part of
a modernization in the economy’s structure. Overall firm-level productivity nevertheless remains
low, constraining firms’ abilities to grow and generate employment.1

1

The Global Competitiveness Index (WEF) identifies low-productivity as one of Kenya’s key constraints.

13

40.
Hence, progress on investment climate reforms, combined with improving firm-level
productivity and innovation, is essential to raising private sector investment and job
creation. Moving vibrant sectors to the next level and critically ensuring that they are able to
compete internationally, thus boosting Kenya’s lagging exports, needs a mixture of capital and
expertise from domestic and international partners. But beyond individual opportunities for the
marketplace to grow across-the-board, the Government needs to deepen and build on the
strengths of the financial sector and be much more forceful in improving the business
environment. The WBG analytical work identified some of the deficiencies that need boosting:
weak contract enforcement, overly regulated sub-markets (e.g., maize), and a stagnating
manufacturing base. Innovation and competitiveness programs in key sectors could be helped by
public support for science, technology, and higher education.
41.
The bottlenecks to private sector dynamism go well beyond the policy environment
and are equally if not more rooted in on-the-ground realities of poor infrastructure; hence,
leveraging private investment in infrastructure is essential and compels WBG engagement
in the public-private partnership (PPP) agenda. Firms are currently faced with high transport
costs given dilapidated roads and railways, and a clogged-up Mombasa port: the average cost to
export a container is US$2,255, compared to US$1,620 in South Africa, US$660 in Mauritius,
and US$456 in Singapore. In addition, firms pay high energy costs at $0.21 per Kwh (versus per
Kwh of $0.18 in Nigeria, $0.10 in South Africa, and $0.08 in China and India). To this end, the
MTP2 identifies huge investments in infrastructure (roads, national railways, urban transport);
energy; and agriculture among other areas. A fraction of these can legitimately be met from
public resources, including those from IDA. But the real opportunity here is to leverage private
sector resources through innovative public-private partnerships, which are currently rather
underdeveloped. Parts of the legal framework for designing and executing PPPs are in reasonable
shape. Hence specific transactions (including those with joint Bank, IFC, and MIGA support—
see Annex 8 on WBG collaboration) in the power sector, for example, have been successfully
arranged. More can be done on financing power generation and distribution yet the trick is now
to expand and widen this approach. In terms of other infrastructural priorities, institutional and
policy reforms with complex political economy considerations are long-needed such as
liberalizing the grain and maize market.
42.
The effect of many of these actions on growth, and ultimately on poverty, can only
be properly traced when relevant and accurate statistics are made available in a timely
manner to policymakers and the general public alike. Such an approach is an essential
component of evidence-based policymaking and for monitoring and evaluating development
impacts of programs being implemented. While Kenya has some strong statistical data, there are
gaps (see Annex 11—Statistics for Results). The last MSME census was in 1999, and a
nationwide household survey—central to reliable poverty data—was last conducted eight years
ago. Action is needed to rectify this situation in the near-term, and to improve statistical
coverage (including gender disaggregation where relevant), accuracy, dissemination and usage
over the longer term.
43.
Placing a premium on human development is essential from several vantage points.
Critically, as the analysis in section 2 demonstrated, growth on its own almost certainly will not
be enough to the deliver the “poverty yield” that Kenya seeks. Inroads must be made in
inequality, and that is more productively achieved by empowering those at the lower ends of the
distribution to move up than by squeezing the top. Furthermore, from an equity perspective, it
14

cannot be right that so many Kenyans face a life of full of hardships largely because of the place
of their birth and family circumstances rather than their own talents and toils. Enhancing
people’s skills and capacity also allows them to become part of a better-qualified workforce
needed to elevate firm-level productivity.
44.
There is an opportunity to make progress in improving public services that have a
direct impact on people’s well-being. Health care may be foremost in this regard, given that the
Government—and new county administrations—are behind a program of health reform.
Although total national spending on health care, at around 5 percent of GDP is not low by
comparable international standards, the effectiveness of such spending requires attention.
Improved healthcare tends to be accompanied not only by better health status but also by lower
fertility rates over the medium term. There is a great opportunity to help build better systems,
including a stronger reliance on results-based healthcare financing at the local level, to leverage
change. The central challenge in education is similar: apply resources more effectively and lift
quality of outcomes rather than quantity of inputs. There is scope to attract more private sector
investment and participation into health and education. Pointers can be taken from IFC’s
financing of a private sector service provider in Kenya and structured, social-service PPPs in
other parts of the world. A brighter picture can be seen on social protection policy, where solid
foundations have been laid to harmonize the somewhat disparate cash transfer programs and
target those even more closely on poor households. This Bank-supported initiative is beginning
to bear fruit now and should continue to do so over the next several years.
45.
In promoting human development, the Government has heightened its emphasis on
youth and youth jobs. Several schemes have been floated, including establishing “Institutes of
Technology” in every ward of the country, and allocating 2.5 percent of national revenue to a
“Youth Enterprise Capital Fund”. From a private sector perspective, there may be interest and
potentially growing involvement from companies who want to work alongside the public sector
in creating jobs, such as those in the Bank-supported Youth Empowerment Project, to educate
and train young people so they fit those openings. WBG is engaging the Ministry of Education’s
new PPP unit as well as other development partners, and exploring mechanisms with which to
strengthen industry-academic linkages. Because the initiatives are so new, it is important to
evaluate progress critically and adapt quickly as needed.
46.
For Kenya to make a huge dent on poverty, support for the growth and realization
of people’s potential must focus on sectors and locations where the majority of the poor can
benefit. In rural areas, the single biggest and most sustainable impact would be to improve
agricultural performance. This is the area where the private sector has an important role to play
in raising incomes by financing small farms, ensuring equitable access to markets, lowering risk
and optimizing value chains. The agricultural agenda, of course, is very much tied up with
Kenya’s competitiveness, and policy/institutional reforms are needed to lift certain constraints to
growth. There is considerable room to improve agricultural productivity, including through more
effective extension services, sustainable soil management practices, better livestock management
(a critical sub-sector for many of the poorest arid and semi-arid counties) and better management
of market, production, and enabling environment risks. Basic rural infrastructure, notably access
roads and irrigation, needs a huge upgrade. Finally long term enhancements to the use of land
resources are called for, such as those facilitated by efficient land registries and secure tenure.
The rural poor would also gains from community driven development which empowers local
people, including women and marginalized groups, to take charge of their own fortunes. In other
15

cases mechanisms such as formal social safety nets, including cash transfers, food security for
the most vulnerable, and sustainable land management support can make the best impact.
47.
In cities it is essential to engage the private sector to help put in place better
infrastructure, housing, health and education to serve the growing population. The
prospects and approaches for doing this must be tailored to specific conditions. In the largest
and relatively more prosperous cities, PPPs will become increasingly tenable (subject to a solid
regulatory framework); and putting these in place will deliver better services and have a
demonstration/knowledge-sharing dimension for elsewhere in the country. In the emerging
secondary cities, there is a chance for public agencies to invest right at the outset to lay the
platform for manageable growth over the long term. And whether in the countryside or on urban
streets, the poor are most exposed to the impacts of disasters, thus making it important to
strengthen disaster planning and management.
48.
The changing institutional landscape is undergoing a tectonic shift with powers and
responsibilities moving from the national government to the 47 new county
administrations. The Bank provided a “Devolution without Disruption” report and supports
implementation through the Accountable Devolution Trust Fund. This transition is truly historic
and by no means easy—few if any countries have attempted anything on this scale or speed in
the recent past. The Constitution envisaged transferring functions gradually over three years, but
most county functions have already been transferred along with approximately 30 percent of
government revenues rather than the Constitutional minimum of 15 percent, leaving some
national government functions potentially under-funded. At this pace, the changes could bring
about risk of service-delivery disruption, including in devolved functions like urban
management, water, health, agriculture, and local roads.
49.
Devolution challenges will likely persist throughout the CPS period, as reviewed in
Annex 10. These include:






Major capacity challenges to get core county planning, PFM, and HR systems in place.
Risks in the largest cities that have inherited significant payroll and debt obligations, at
the same time as reduced central transfers.
Unique challenges of historically marginalized areas. Larger transfers to counties in arid
and semi-arid regions provide an opportunity to address long-standing infrastructure and
service delivery gaps. But these counties typically face major capacity gaps.
Sectors that are being devolved to counties the fastest, including health, agriculture, and
local infrastructure service delivery.
Implementation of constitutional and legal provisions on incorporating transparency and
citizen participation into county (and urban) planning, budgeting, and performance
management systems.

50.
While it is essential to minimize what will be inevitable hiccups over the next several
years, the real challenge is to deliver a “devolution dividend”. That dividend will be
manifested through greater citizen engagement, direction, and oversight of public authorities to
fundamentally deliver better services to ordinary people and build better local-level business
environments. Maintaining expectations is important as devolution is a long-term process that
goes well beyond this CPS period. At the local level it involves building new governmental
structures, institutions, and systems that are responsive and responsible; and fresh inter16

governmental relationships, including resource transfers that translate policy priorities into
meaningful on-the-ground services.
51.
In practice, the needs and opportunities for institutional improvement vary across
the levels of agencies involved in the devolution landscape. At the central level, ministries—
especially the Treasury and the Ministry of Devolution—have to build capacity to oversee a new
way of doing business in which a large share of national tax revenue is passed to county
administrations. The approach has to be “lean and mean” (there is no point building local public
administration if central government also expands) yet effective in rigorous public financial
management and sensible fiscal discipline. At the county level, the 47 units need to develop their
own ability to be responsive and accountable, not least through transparency in resource use and
active citizen engagement. They must also find ways of working together, perhaps through the
Council of County Governors, so they can exploit synergies on cross-boundary issues, such as
sub-regional (multi-county) business competitiveness, and promote learning from each other.
52.
The 2010 Constitution ushered in other major changes to help reinforce the
institutional “pillars of integrity”. Alongside the Public Financial Management Act (2012), it
has clarified roles and responsibilities of the Office of the Auditor General, created the Office of
the Controller of Budget, and increased the checks and balances with stronger oversight by the
legislature over the executive. Furthermore, the judiciary has been strengthened with greater
independence, with the roles of Chief Justice and Supreme Court undergoing transformation to
improve their judicial performance.

A.

STRATEGIC OPTIONS TO MAKE THE MOST OF WBG ASSETS

Aligning with WBG Twin Goals and Being Selective

53.
The WBG-supported program in Kenya aligns with the WBG twin goals and must
be—and will be—selective against a wide-ranging national agenda. The MTP2, for example,
identifies 38 areas of intervention, and its results framework sets as many as 292 targeted
outputs. What is the best way of doing this? The Bank will use a selectivity test that deploys a
four-pronged benchmark to guide deployment of its scarce resources to maximize the prospects
of success. Specifically:






Confirming a credible line of sight to make a sustainable impact on poverty and
prosperity. Selectivity will be driven by the degree in which interventions directly target
the poor, whether there is evidence to show that the expected economic benefit is
substantial, taking into consideration, where appropriate, creating jobs and helping poor
beneficiaries, including women.
Critically reviewing WBG capability and comparative advantage (including assessing
opportunities for collaboration). The role of other development players will be important
in assessing how the WBG can add value. This benchmark also examines whether the
WBG has an established track record in the suggested areas of intervention and, if not,
whether an experienced team can be deployed.
Cementing client ownership. The existence of a forceful, meaningful, and formal request
from the relevant line ministry and Treasury, the intervention’s inclusion in the MTP2,
and a review of any resistance to the proposed intervention are some considerations that
will gauge the level of client engagement.
17



Calibrating client capacity and accompanying project design. The track record will be
reviewed regarding adequate client capacity in relevant line ministries, credible
procurement and financial management resources and expertise, integrity and corruption
concerns, and how gaps in the above can be addressed and built into project design where
needed.

54.
This selectivity test is used in a cascading fashion. First, broad domains of engagement
have been established that are drawn from the systematic diagnosis of constraints and
opportunities highlighted above (see Figure 4 and Annex 15). A limited set of specific and
measurable outcomes within each domain of engagement have been identified, in line with the
Government of Kenya’s key strategic vision. These targeted results help identify sectors within
these domains that will be given priority. Conversely, as sectors gain higher priority, selectivity
inevitably means that WBG will scale down or not engage in some areas. And in implementing
the CPS, the selectivity test will be applied to make detailed choices on particular operations and
analytical advisory activities (AAA).

Focus of Engagement

55.

The overall strategy will move forward with three domains of engagement:




Competitiveness and sustainability – growth to eradicate poverty;
Protection and potential – human resource development for shared prosperity;
Building consistency and equity – delivering a devolution dividend.

56.
Individually and collectively, the achievement of sustainable development results
will only be possible if they are bound together through a connecting platform of garnering
good governance, which in some ways has been an Achilles heel in the past. More needs to be
done on both the demand and supply side of governance. On the demand side of good
governance, WBG interventions in the main domains will also build on governance-related
dimensions such as transparency, accountability and openness, third-party monitoring, and
increasingly robust public financial management. On the supply side of good governance,
18

accountability will be built through strengthening critical institutions and processes such as the
Parliamentary Budget Office, Auditor General, Controller of the Budget, new county assemblies,
and citizen participation in key issues. This is an area where the input and expertise of the World
Bank Institute (WBI or its successor) will be particularly valuable.
57.
The results-based focus helps define the country program and its selectivity within
each domain. The overview is shown in Figure 5, with details in Annex 1. Each domain is
discussed in specific sections that follow, which conclude with a summary of specific results
being targeted (as shown in the overviews by domain in Figures 6, 7, and 8).

C. Domain One: Competitiveness and Sustainability—Growth to Eradicate
Poverty
58.
On competitiveness and sustainability, enhanced infrastructure and logistics are the
backbone of long-term growth. This is, however, a wide-ranging agenda; the MTP2 envisages
investments upwards of US$43 billion over the next five years. Hence, the WBG is establishing
some early priorities that are ambitious but not over-reaching. In the energy sector, WBG
collaboration and long-established relationships with public and private sector partners will be
expanded (Box 3). WBG policy advice will help the authorities create a well-functioning and
properly regulated market and continue to provide technical assistance to selected government
agencies. Support will extend to Kenya’s cooperation with neighboring countries to facilitate
energy cooperation, including through common technical standards and power-pool trading. IDA
19

financing will be used for some publicly merited investments, in the first instance targeted at
electricity modernization through upgrading of selected transmission and distribution networks
that will hugely improve technical and billing efficiency. IFC and MIGA instruments will help
leverage more private resources, most notably in independent power production and renewables,
perhaps also including geothermal sources. IFC, if market conditions allow, is open to
substantially increasing its investments in infrastructure by drawing on an impressive network of
investors that it has already built up. MIGA guarantees, which have recently been made more
flexible to better cover breach of contract and state-owned enterprises, will also be marketed
actively. A summary of the results for Domain One is in Figure 6 at end of this subsection.
Box 3: Three is Better than One: WBG Collaboration Powers Ahead
Over the last couple of years, the three WBG institutions along with MIGA, IFC, and IDA have pulled together
path-breaking combinations of financial support in specific private-sector deals that are creating new power supply
for the citizens of Kenya. In Thika Power and Triumph Power, MIGA has provided political risk insurance to make
the projects bankable and attract foreign investment into Kenya. IDA has complemented that with a partial-risk
guarantee supporting short-term liquidity. And IFC has underpinned it with direct investments into the private
companies building and operating the new power plants. Thika Power itself will bring 87 megawatts of power on
line with a 20-year power purchasing agreement. Just as importantly, a clear precedent has been set to demonstrate
to the private sector, Government, and the WBG, that working together facilitates long-term investment and
produces more results for all the players involved. Altogether, WBG engagement in the energy sector targets adding
2,300 MW installed generation capacity from diversified sources.

59.
More broadly the WBG will ramp up its already considerable support to publicprivate partnerships, especially in the energy, water, and transport sectors where there is
medium-term potential. This assistance is grounded in the recently commenced Infrastructure
Financing and Private Public Partnership Project that builds capacity of the enabling regulatory
and institutional framework, including the Treasury’s PPP unit. It also pushes the agenda through
extensive analytic work, including detailed legal and operational lessons from comparable
experience in other regions, especially South-South exchanges. As the Government’s PPP
pipeline solidifies, WBG will have a greater “transactions focus”, exploiting the synergies
between IFC instruments, complemented by MIGA products, and potential IDA leveraging. One
example arises with the Government-proposed viability gap financing, where private sector
project capital can be mobilized to get projects done. Another example is in the water sector that
has a rather nascent institutional environment where private participation has yet to emerge. Here
WBG specialists (including from the Water and Sanitation Program) are providing capacity
building to help move things forward in progressive counties, including potential support for
public-private partnerships in water treatment plants and water delivery.
60.
On transport, the different instruments available across the WBG will be used
judiciously to support trade-offs in selective engagement. For IDA resources, the focus of
new lending will be on significant feeder (rural) roads within and between counties, connecting
communities to emerging economic opportunities (and so tying closely to the poverty agenda).
The current IDA portfolio will follow through on commitments made to larger-scale
infrastructure, including public resources, as an emergency response to re-build core
infrastructure following the tragic fire at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in the summer of
2013. But, beyond that, the shift in approach means doing less in terms of allocating IDA to
highways and similar programs.

20

61.
For IFC and MIGA resources, combined with Bank AAA expertise, there should be
growing possibilities over the longer term from private sector engagement. Public-private
partnerships in airports, highways, and modern urban transport may be on the horizon and will
be pursued by WBG. MIGA, whose products include both traditional political risk insurance
coverage and new cover for non-honoring of financial obligations, can help leverage crossborder investments. MIGA will actively seek to deepen its engagement in Kenya through
proactive business development efforts in the infrastructure, manufacturing, and agribusiness
sectors, in addition to its already strong engagement in the energy sector. There is no doubt about
the importance of making improvements at the Port of Mombasa if Kenya is to serve its own and
neighboring economies properly. Other development partners are providing financial support;
WGB has delivered analytical and investment support in this area over recent years, so given
selectivity pressures further IDA resource allocation in the near term is a lower priority.
62.
Competitiveness can also be enhanced through improving the enabling
environment, unleashing the potential of specific sectors and geographic locations,
increasing firm-level productivity, and ramping up financial sector and capital market
development. The joint IFC-IDA/donor-financed Investment Climate Program will actively
support renewed and increased commitment to improving the “Doing Business” position,
particularly in the areas of business regulation, trade logistics, and advising on tax policy that
supports entrepreneurship (see Figure 6). On growth sectors, WBG has a carefully crafted
involvement in the rapidly emerging oil and gas sector. More broadly, IFC and MIGA see
potential market opportunities—with a poverty-reducing angle—in agribusiness, health,
education, and niche manufacturing, many of which WBG can open up through analytical work
such as the ongoing Kenya Industrialization Road Map and the National Tourism Strategy. The
IFC is already a major player in Kenya’s financial services industry and will continue to look for
new opportunities. IFC expects to increase commitments to financial institutions over the coming
years as market conditions allow. IFC and World Bank advisory services will focus on
strengthening the banking system and capital markets through support to the Central Bank and
Capital Markets Authority as well as in developing corporate bond markets and county-level
pension schemes, mortgage markets, financial sector regionalization in the East African
Community, and financial inclusion.
63.
Kenya’s large cities are engines of growth and the urbanization trend is
unstoppable, so improving access to water and transport services in urban areas will be
key. Nearly one-third of Kenyans live in cities with expected growth to one-half by 2030 (Figure
3). Nairobi could become a metropolis of nearly 8 million inhabitants, and Mombasa could be a
second piston in the growth engine. Secondary cities provide an important rural-urban linkage in
the system of cities and can serve as an important driver for off-farm employment opportunities
for the rural population. So WBG involvement will blend IFC and Bank resources that create
private sector jobs, improve infrastructure, and provide better services to make cities more
livable and sustainable. To shape future support, WBG will draw upon the lessons from its
current project-level engagement and a comprehensive analytical piece (an Urbanization
Review) to be completed in the first months of this CPS period. There are several binding
constraints that WBG might help tackle, including providing access to clean water, coping with
waste management through sanitary landfills, improving informal settlements (a third or more of
the capital’s population reportedly reside in peri-urban slums), stimulating mortgage financing
more broadly, reducing transport congestion, and enhancing urban governance and management.
21

There is considerable donor interest in this sector. And there is potential for the WBG to expand
its already fruitful partnerships, perhaps even to include reimbursable service agreements to
further this agenda. Moving from an input- to outcomes-based approach will be a fundamental
tenant of the future support to urban development.
64.
As Kenya’s rapid rise in population continues and if GDP growth accelerates, there
will be commensurate pressure on environmental and social sustainability. This is connected
with the climate change agenda, which affects Kenya in its propensity to suffer from natural
calamities, including both drought and flooding (given the country’s weather and territorial
conditions, each of these impacts sometimes take place even within the same year in neighboring
locations). Based on experience, especially in the most recent CPS period, the WBG can expect
selective engagement on climate change issues to be focused on providing more resources for
water security and climate resilience. Other development partners are expected to lend assistance
for protecting coastal areas, the rift valley, and highland plains—containing areas of outstanding
natural beauty and precious wildlife— against threats that include encroachment and pollution.
65.
The Government is meeting many of these challenges such as protecting natural
heritage and managing some aspects of climate change with strong support from the AfDB
and other development partners. Given this level of support, WBG involvement will be highly
selective on its comparative advantage, and focused in the first instance on water security and
water sanitation. While land reform could also be an important contributor to long-term growth,
it is a highly contested area and unless conditions look propitious, the WBG does not anticipate a
heavy involvement during this CPS period.

D.

Domain Two: Protection and Potential—Delivering Shared Prosperity

66.
To protect the vulnerable and help them develop their potential, multiple measures are
needed that focus on key groups. The WBG will continue its strong engagement in social
protection. The Social Safety Nets Program for Results, which commenced operations in the fall
of 2013, targets covering an additional 450,000 people (see Figure 7 at end of subsection). It is
also being monitored closely along with the accompanying capacity-building work; WBG stands
ready to supplement resources should that be merited in the latter part of the CPS period. With
regard to health priority, the combined resources of IDA and IFC, alongside global funds and
other partners, will be scaled up. IFC is pursuing an innovative combination of support for
hospital care together with techniques to attract private sector expertise and resources into lowerlevel primary care as well. This is being complemented by near-term, IDA additional financing
to scale-up results-based financing and support introduction of health insurance subsidies for the
22

poor. The financing also targets increasing access to a basic package of health, nutrition, or
reproductive health services to an additional 1,000,000 women (see Figure 7). Another planned
operation during the CPS with a strong focus on results will include a relevant gender-focus as
informed by the WBG’s forthcoming Poverty and Gender Assessment. The Bank will join the
ongoing multi-partner-supported effort to help the government to develop innovative financing
options to sustain priority national programs such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria and
prepare for the emerging burden of non-communicable diseases. A summary of expected results
for Domain Two are found in Figure 7.
67.
Another high priority to target support for the poor is a focus on agriculture—a
direct link with helping families in rural areas. There is considerable scope for public
investments (including with IDA) to raise productivity and economic returns. Potential IFC
investments in infrastructure, agro processing, and financial institutions further support this goal.
Indeed supporting agribusiness and food security in Africa as a whole and Kenya in particular
are goals of an aggressive multiyear IFC initiative. The performance of agriculture in Kenya
however is mixed. On the one hand, parts of its private sector-driven segments such as flowers
and horticulture are global leaders—a lion’s share of the huge European flower market is sourced
from Kenya. Here the challenge is to continue that expansion in an environmentally sustainable
way, which may provide opportunities for companies to benefit from IFC involvement, including
through its internationally accepted performance standards on safeguards.
68.
On the other hand, much of publically influenced and small-scale agriculture
performs very poorly. Maize yields, for example, have hardly risen in years, and the domestic
consumer price is actually higher than in major OECD economies. While women provide over
70 percent of the rural labor force, they own only less than 5 percent of land titles and face other
obstacles to maximizing agricultural output. Part of existing operations are addressing women’s
productivity, technology adoption, and lifting other constraints to females generating sustainable
livelihoods; but it is too early to declare success. Given this state of affairs, for the agricultural
sector as a whole, the WBG will be deliberative in laying the groundwork to step up engagement
in this sector where involvement has been modest to date. First, the WBG will reinvigorate that
knowledge base to carefully delineate the precise constraints to and levers of change, including
political economy considerations. Second, the WBG will use that knowledge to confirm
energetic ownership by the authorities for specific transformative investments. Third, the WBG
will continue to look for profitable, job-creating agribusiness; “access to rural finance”; and
value-added opportunity investments for IFC support, especially since increasing agribusiness
investments is a strategic goal for IFC in Sub-Saharan Africa. Fourth, IDA operations will be
designed to perhaps include community development support and irrigation of an additional
45,000 hectares of land (see Figure 7), to respond to these lessons.
69.
The burgeoning youth population brings with it a distinctive set of opportunities
and problems. WBG will help the Government address joblessness. A Global Partnership for
Education operation (US$88 million) is under preparation. In addition, IFC has invested US$10
million to support the expansion of Bridge International Academies to provide high-quality
primary education for children of poor families. More planned analytical work could be
complemented by IFC investments as market opportunities develop. Current financial
management and other fiduciary work will refine assessments and improve the governance
environment in the education sector. Robust evidence of improved governance would then make
23

possible deployment of IDA resources more feasible in the coming years. The Bank expects to
continue its work as needed on youth employment, including exploring other interventions to
help ensure young people are properly prepared for work. The AfDB has given particular
emphasis to youth in its new strategy and plans significant investment. And across the board, the
forthcoming Poverty and Gender Assessment will influence WBG operations and analytical
work, including support for female education, entrepreneurship, and rural women’s groups.
70.
The poor must be protected from the impact of disasters and climate-related
changes to their environments. Climate variability and hydro-climatic shocks (droughts and
floods) impact disproportionately on the poor. It is estimated that as many as half of the
population lacks access to adequate and nutritious food. Climate change is projected to
exacerbate existing climate risks and water resource constraints. The WBG will work on this
through several channels. The Water Security and Climate Resilience Project helps set a sound
institutional and investment framework to reduce vulnerability of the country and the poor
segments of its population to these events. A new phase of this program will support the Coastal
region through financing of infrastructure that will enhance the resilience of the poor in this
region. The additional financing to the health sector project under the IDA Crisis Response
Window provides the urgent response required to the drought-affected districts to manage acute
malnutrition cases at health facilities and distribute supplementary foods at the community level
for the moderately malnourished children using existing channels.
71.
In the four most marginalized counties of northern Kenya, the Bank is supporting
the improved social safety nets that will be financed through the National Drought
Contingency Fund. Subject to Trust Fund resources being available, the WBG can work with
the nascent National Disaster Risk Management Authority to build its capacity. There may also
be scope for insurance instruments (involving the private sector) to help finance disaster-related
spending. Across its portfolio, the WBG will support public and private sector counterparts in
ensuring that building and design standards take into account disaster risks; the WBG will leave
flexibility in IDA operations to respond to disaster needs should that occur. The WBG can also
consider stand-alone investments on disaster risk management, but it is possible that other
partners may have more of an opportunity in this field. The WBG will keep this under review as
part of regular donor coordination.

E. Domain Three. Consistency and Equity: Delivering a Devolution Dividend
72.
The focus on building consistency and equity—a really long-term drive—has
devolution at its core. The WBG will use a large-scale, capacity-building and AAA program to
inform a series of IDA operations, which help both counties and national agencies to make
devolution work. The first of these will be completed in FY15, and others will follow—perhaps
using a results-based instrument and quite possibly with substantial co-financing from other
development partners. Upon request, the WBG is prepared to take a lead role in assembling and
managing a trust fund framework to maximize donor coherence in this fluid arena. IFC will be
engaged, but likely in a more limited way initially—such as engaging with subnational
authorities on infrastructure provision or subnational reviews of the business climate—since
devolution-related market opportunities are few and far between at this early stage. Analytical
work will assess the fiscal impacts of devolution, including the approach to revenue collection,
sharing, and debt management, with particular attention to potential imbalances between
counties and among communities within counties. The WBG will also support the authorities in
helping address the different risks faced by urban and marginalized rural areas so that their
growth potential can be maximized. This will include on-the-ground investments targeting at
least 25 percent of counties to deliver improved sanitation against benchmark standards, and an
additional 200,000 children immunized in local health facilities. A summary of expected results
for Domain Three is found in Figure 8 at end of this subsection.
73.
On governance, the Bank will expand support for programs to create and
strengthen fiscal management capabilities at the county level and provide support to
strengthen oversight institutions. These institutions include the Office of the Controller of
Budget, Office of the Auditor General, anti-corruption agency, finance committees in Parliament
and country assemblies, and public procurement institutions. Also, the Bank will support roll-out
of basic transparency and citizen participation mechanisms in county planning, budgeting, and
performance management (consistent with the Constitution and the legal framework) and will
draw on growing global experience linking social accountability with enhanced development
outcomes, targeting at least 20 percent of the counties (see Figure 8).
74.
Consistent and equitable treatment of vulnerable groups, including indigenous
peoples, will be a focus of tailored Bank engagement. In addition to careful application of
good practice safeguards in Bank-supported operations, a program of dialogue and capacity
building of key national authorities working in this field is anticipated. This long-term initiative
will be calibrated to respond to Government ownership and also the engagement of other
international partners, especially bilateral donors.
75.
A more evidence-based approach to policymaking and public investment decisions
will certainly aid the consistency and impact of public administration reform. A prerequisite
for this is the availability and open dissemination of quality and timely statistics. Kenya has
made some progress in this area (with support from the Bank and others) but remains vulnerable
to some woeful gaps (see Annex 11). Given this, the WBG anticipates renewing its engagement
with the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS), the Treasury, the Ministry of Information
Communications Technology, and other relevant institutions. The WBG will help in meeting an
urgent need for a rigorous national Household Budget Survey (targeted for 2014/15), pivotal to
producing up-to-date estimates of poverty and income growth. The Bank will also encourage and
support strengthened collection and monitoring of gender disaggregated. In addition, WBG
25

joined the partners supporting the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS2014). Data
from these new surveys will confirm aspects of this CPS’s approach; permit mid-course
corrections as needed, including through a progress report to the Board; and inform the CPS
results framework.
76.
The consistency of Kenya’s development will be buttressed by deepening regional
integration with its neighbors. The WBG will provide a mixture of analytical activities and
investment for near and longer-term initiatives. Some—such as advisory services to the capital
markets authority to help facilitate regional financial deepening, or partnering for results with
TradeMark East Africa on a Mombasa Port Charter to enhance operations—can be delivered
primarily with Kenya counterparts. Others such as continuing transformative road and energy
investments linking Kenya with Tanzania, Ethiopia, and other locations require multi-country
agreements.
77.
To garner good governance, which is a connecting platform for equity and
influences the success of broad efforts in all areas, a multi-pronged approach is used. At its
heart is capacity building to strengthen oversight institutions, including support for better public
fiscal management and heightened transparency and accountability in the use of public resources
through demand-side institutions such as the use of barazas (open community meetings) for
beneficiary engagement. WBG support will help ensure greater citizen feedback on the quality of
service delivery, including the use of citizen report cards in key sectors such as health. Other
work includes (a) integrated Bank and IFC advice on investment climate (national and
subnational), public-private partnerships, and corporate governance; (b) partnering with WBI (or
its successor) on transparency, social accountability, and citizen engagement, including the
voices of women, in coalitions of change; (c) reviewing the impact of project-level governance
measures; and (d) scaling up those that have been effective, including drawing on input from the
Department for Institutional Integrity on project safeguards and institutional support to agencies
such as the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC). WBG stands ready to deploy
“corruption calibration” to its lending program by which it adjusts areas of focus and/or scales
back resources in the event of issues that unduly threaten the security of IDA and IFC resource
use.

A.

IMPLEMENTING FOR RESULTS

Lessons Learned from the CPS Completion Report

78.
Lessons from experience including analysis from the Independent Evaluation Group
(IEG) have contributed to this strategy. Among past achievements have been (a) a gradual
move to larger projects (i.e., those over US$100 million), some of which have simpler design;
(b) notable WBG collaboration and performance in selected areas, including the power sector
where IFC, MIGA, and Bank resources have been combined in specific investments; (c)
expansion of IFC investments and improving profitability, helped by a strong on-the-ground
presence in IFC’s Nairobi-based hub office; and (d) effective collaboration between the Bank
and Government to strengthen fiduciary management at project level. Energy, water and
sanitation, ICT, agriculture, social protection, and the environment represent the sectors with
outcomes that “achieved” or “mostly achieved” success with CPS outcomes. For more details of
past achievements, Annex 2 provides the Completion Report for the CPS FY10-13.
79.
Lessons learned also include some weaknesses. Several projects had not fully met their
objectives because of poor monitoring and evaluation, and insufficient attention to political
economy. One weakness observed was a heavy share of AAA that although technically
competent was not driven by unambiguous client demand and thus had difficulty gaining
traction. In another case, CPS results framework did not always fully capture Bank activities or
in some instances was too ambitious. Private sector development, transport, education, urban
development, and governance represent sectors with outcomes that were only “partially
achieved” or “not achieved”.
80.
Past components of success included dynamic government sponsorship (ICT),
systemic and strategic objective setting (energy), solid AAA (social protection), and
maximizing opportunities for WBG collaboration and private sector involvement (energy).
Conversely, weaknesses were more apparent when these components were absent or when as in
the case of the governance theme WBG work was not well captured in the results framework.
The overall assessment of the outcome of the last CPS was “moderately satisfactory”. This
compares favorably with an outcome rating of “unsatisfactory” in the previous FY04-09 CPS
Completion Report while suggesting room for improvement.

B.

Operational Responses and the Focus on Results

81.
In targeting such improvement, there are several practical areas to pursue over the
coming years. It is important to continue to “move to scale” especially in IDA investments, but
also in IFC commitments, by focusing on larger projects and the judicious use of additional
finance. IEG evidence suggests that historically larger IDA projects (above US$100 million) are
twice as likely to be successful as smaller ones. Fiduciary management can be strengthened at
project level by focusing more on governance systems at national and subnational levels.
Renewed efforts to “stay on schedule” are also important since IDA projects, which complete
within five years or so, are notably more successful than those that spin out over longer periods.
This may necessitate some tough decisions in closing lagging projects as part of regular portfolio
clean up.

27

82.
To ensure that client service is prompt and responsive, the WBG will make
maximum use of Nairobi-based expertise. The new hub co-locates IFC and the Bank, and will
help facilitate rapid deployment of expertise from the Global Practices. Working closely as well
with the private sector will signal at an early stage to all parties what the due diligence
requirements are, how long they are likely to take, and what the cost implications are likely to be.
Verifying that there is sufficient capacity to commission and supervise these due diligence
requirements within the relevant government ministries, utilities, and other corporate bodies is
also important.
83.
A results focus will drive the implementation of the CPS, including with careful
monitoring and evaluation. The results matrix is detailed in Annex 1. Targeted outcomes have
been articulated in a multi-sector fashion, reflecting the interdependence of the activities across
the strategy. Multidisciplinary WBG teams that produced the key elements of this results
framework will continue to operate through strategy implementation. They will be responsible
for conducting multi-sector dialogue for each outcome, ensuring adequate coordination and realtime monitoring of progress. Every six months, a country team workshop will assess progress
toward CPS targets and make programmatic decisions toward results. Annually, a joint clientWBG workshop will review progress toward results, moving beyond the standard metrics of
portfolio implementation and keeping an eye on the poverty and shared prosperity ambitions.
Adjustments will be considered as needed to implementation modalities or the strategy itself.
84.
WBG’s efforts to manage for results across the country program build on country
systems and capabilities for measuring and monitoring progress. Most of the indicators
included in the results matrix have been drawn from the Government’s MTP2, allowing for
synergies in monitoring and capacity building (these are marked with an asterisk in Annex 1).
The strategy also seeks to provide diverse support for relevant government partners in planning
and budgeting, institutional strengthening, and statistical capacity building. Raising awareness
and strengthening capacity among implementing agencies to manage for results is fundamental;
and new operations will, where possible, support sector monitoring and evaluation systems and
reform of incentives to achieve results. Ultimately, strengthening domestic accountability
mechanisms will create sustained incentives to achieve better results. Third-party monitoring in
signature projects across strategic objectives of the CPS will be used where appropriate to
provide an independent perspective on progress toward results, enhancing accountability for
resources and outcomes.

C.

Selectivity in Practice

85.
Selectivity is key and at an operational level involves difficult trade-offs and, indeed
competing pressures. Coping with demands from line ministries and in-country donors for
Bank involvement needs strong partnerships and mature dialogue. The potential pressure from
such demands will also be managed by a disciplined strategic and operational approach. The
latter is not a mechanistic filtering exercise and will call for professional judgment, but the
process can be disciplined with a simple checklist that teams utilize during project concept and
preparation. This process is dynamic and the assessments will be continuously updated. The
current findings in Figure 9 show areas where more is likely to be done especially in terms of
IDA investment and, correspondingly, sectors where less will be done (or a new approach such
as relying on private finance or other development partners).

Note: This represents the current assessment of selectivity, especially in the relative allocation of new IDA resources in the CPS
period. IFC investments are determined by market conditions and are also part of doing things differently (e.g., in PPPs in major
transport schemes, other infrastructure). AAA planning will complement this approach and be available to meet other demands
where the WBG has a comparative advantage and the resources to respond.

86.
The approach also means that this is not business as usual. To the contrary, this new
CPS differs from the previous one. There is a strategic shift in IDA resource allocation that
emerges from aligning with the WBG twin goals and the selectivity test, as shown in Figure 10.
Relatively more is likely to be directed toward human resource development (Domain II)
including in agriculture/rural development, and in delivering a devolution dividend (Domain III,
which is new). Relatively less IDA financing will be deployed on competitiveness (Domain I),
where new opportunities for private financing, including with growing IFC support, are expected
to emerge.

Note: Lending made in the CPS FY10-13 period came under different themes but has been reclassified into the three
domains of engagement in the new CPS to illustrate the strategic shift of the allocation of resources. Pipeline planning is
advanced for FY15 (see Table 3). Outer years are still being developed and so are not shown in detail; but indicative
broad allocations have been used to show likely evolution.

87.
Careful portfolio management will continue to be important with tailored
approaches to suit the particular circumstances of Bank, IFC, and MIGA investments. At
mid-FY14, the total IDA portfolio in Kenya was US$4.3 billion, covering 23 national projects
(US$3.5 billion) and 7 regional projects in which Kenya is a partner (US$0.8 billion)—see
Annex 4. Portfolio value more than doubled over the last four years and in many respects
performance has been robust. The disbursement ratio, for example, was 18 percent in FY13,
around Africa norms. But there are significant challenges—more than 20 percent of projects
have less-than-satisfactory implementation progress, and vigilance is needed on governance and
safeguard issues in some sectors. The slow flow of funds through government systems has been
an obstacle to smooth project implementation. Further, some projects suffer from weak fiduciary
performance and project management leading to slow project implementation. Delays in
receiving audit reports and Interim Financial Reports (IFRs) are a continuing problem. The Bank
also receives audit reports with qualifications relating to issues that the accountants should
address, such as missing documentation. This occasionally leads to ineligible expenditures that
take time to resolve (by the government submitting eligible receipts or returning the ineligible
funds). To help, many accountants, auditors, and project staff have participated in Banksupported FM capacity-building training that will continue during this CPS.
88.
Acknowledging this problem, the Government of Kenya has initiated far-reaching
portfolio-level FM reforms with the Bank’s support to address identified fiduciary
weaknesses in management of donor projects and devolved funds. Over the CPS period,
practical measures to address these will include (a) regular client-led reviews, at senior level, on
cross-cutting portfolio issues; (b) semi-annual workshops for project implementation client teams
on fiduciary, contract management, and disbursement performance; (c) locating a senior
environmental expert in Nairobi to strengthen Bank safeguard resources; (d) collaborating with
INT in outreach to Government counterparts in developing stronger vigilance measures; and (e)
establishing a country-coordination mechanism across the WBG’s new Global Practices to share
experience and bring the best expertise to bear on implementation issues.
30

89.
The IFC portfolio has grown even more rapidly than that of IDA and stood at
US$785 million at mid-FY14. Decent market conditions have helped, and IFC has been able to
drive forward development impact while retaining an appropriate focus on profitability. The IFC
region-wide hub, co-located with the Bank in Nairobi, provides a critical mass of on-the-ground
expertise, which helps foster ever-closer client connections, including just-in-time responses to
portfolio challenges. MIGA’s current total exposure to Kenya is US$255 million, and
international investors’ interest in the infrastructure, power, and agri-business sectors provides
potential for this regional interaction to expand further.
90.
The WBG could be providing over US$1 billion per year to Kenya over the
timeframe of this CPS. With regard to the portfolio, IFC hopes to continue its expansion—
perhaps even beyond the US$200 million rise each year in commitments over the last two full
fiscal years—if market conditions permit, as well as a steady increase in Advisory Services
engagements. MIGA is following a similar path and already extended over US$100 million of
guarantees in each of the last couple of years. The Bank’s annual commitments will be governed
by the IDA17 settlement, provisionally around US$600 million each year. It should be noted that
actual IDA allocations will depend on (a) total IDA resources available; (b) the country's
performance rating, GNI per capita, and population; (c) the terms of IDA assistance
(grants/credits) and the allocation deductions associated with Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
(MDRI) annual debt service forgone; (d) the performance, other allocation parameters, and IDA
assistance terms for other IDA borrowers; and (e) the number of IDA-eligible countries.
91.
The lending program will be concentrated in key areas. The near-term plan is shown
in Table 3. Outer years will be firmed up as the CPS progresses, consistent with achieving the
results framework targets. Kenya is also expected to continue to engage in regional projects that
will leverage additional IDA resources from the set-aside pool. The new IDA portfolio will give
significant emphasis to more systematically impactful projects—each informed by prior AAA.

Knowledge work will play an important role in the CPS program. In the near term,
the CPS will develop a strong knowledge platform around poverty, gender, infrastructure,
31

agriculture, jobs/skills, and devolution as Table 4 shows. In outer years, AAA will be tailored to
inform future lending, respond to Government needs, and deepen advice in key areas, including
governance and public financial management.

93.
A broad range of WBG instruments will be used, including the Program-for-Results
(PforR) tool, and financing innovations will be sought. IDA investment lending has been the
bread-and-butter of financial engagement in Kenya. This is expected to continue in this CPS
period and be complemented by IDA’s other lending instruments that provide the best fit for
delivering strong development impact. The first PforR operation for Kenya was approved in July
2013 and more use of PforR is expected, including for the devolution programs. The
Government has indicated interest in also tapping into IBRD resources, perhaps as “enclave
financing” for high-profile infrastructure projects. This is worth exploring as it can lay the
foundations for Kenya to smoothly transition to fuller use of IBRD over the longer term.
94.
The WBG resources and activities are being aligned around collaboration with
donors and other financiers. Kenya has a multiplicity of donors. There are good mechanisms to
cooperate, not least of which is the semi-annual Government-led Development Partnership
Forum and the complementary monthly Development Partners Group meeting (see Annex 14 for
details). In several areas—investment climate, social protection, water security, and health, to
name a few—there is explicit and large-scale co-financing of WBG-supported programs. That
said, it is a fairly crowded landscape, and there is scope for clarification of comparative
advantage and simplification of some processing burdens on the Kenyan administration. With
this in mind, WBG will lead more explicitly taking a back seat or even withdrawing from some
sectors where the AfDB and others may fit better. The WBG will continue to assist Kenya by
32

raising and managing trust funds but only on a very selective basis since it is important to note
that traditionally these have not been of a large-scale overall. That picture may not change in the
near term.
95.
The benefits from the WBG program would be amplified by improved governance
and reduced corruption, or undermined by any deterioration in the prevailing environment.
In moving forward the Bank will be firm in its intolerance for corruption and desire for impunity
to end. Inevitably, scandals will occur; but as not to be thrown off course, the WBG will set
sensible expectations to make step-by-step progress. Prudent features, informed by governance
specialists from across the Bank, will continue to be built into project design. These include, for
example, in-depth fiduciary reviews, third-party monitoring and reporting on physical project
outputs, and robust procurement packages.
96.
The Bank’s analytical work will continue to help improve public financial
management—most notably solidifying and extending the IFMIS, making greater use of
properly controlled electronic funds transfer, and supporting capacity in the country’s supreme
audit institution (KENAO) to deepen its work, including in performance audits. The WBG
together with other development partners will extend further support for better procurement
practices, including through potential revisions to the Public Procurement Law, more efficient eprocurement, reforming of the supplies branch, and capacity building, especially at county level.
This is part of a broader drive for institution building and the enhancing of corporate governance
standards, openness, transparency, and accountability in government. This applies at a national
and county level—and should help protect the integrity of WBG resources as well as Kenya’s
internally generated resources, which contribute to 90 percent of all public spending.
97.
Implementation of the CPS will receive guidance through a mid-way progress
report to the Board, which will propose course corrections as needed. In the coming year, for
example, it is expected that the authorities will produce more up-to-date poverty estimates,
which the Bank will complement with a new and detailed Poverty and Gender Assessment. The
WBG should be open to the possibility that such findings may call for adjustments in the
program. Similarly, the devolution field is fast moving so the WBG will adapt as new
information and demands emerge. Finally, governance conditions and their implications for the
WBG program will be monitored vigilantly.

VI

MANAGING RISKS

98.
The WBG faces significant risks in Kenya, yet broadly it has a sanguine outlook that
the downsides, which may emerge, are likely to be manageable and/or have a modest
probability of occurring.
99.
The greatest risk to prospects of poverty reduction is any potential macroeconomic
instability, including from possible fiscal pressures associated with devolution. Kenya has a
fairly open economy and even now its net exports remain a drag on GDP growth. If it were to be
hit by an external shock such as reduced international demand, tightening global liquidity that
curtailed short-term inflows, oil shock, or other deterioration in the terms of trade, the impact
would be noticeable. The mitigation strategy has to revolve around the long-term drive to
improve competitiveness and exports, combined with a prudent strategy on reserves and
international capital access to cope with potential volatility. The threats to undermining sensible
33

macroeconomic policy come largely from wage pressures on fiscal policy and populist politics
that can create actual or contingent liabilities. For example, there are pressures to hold down
power tariffs at unrealistic levels. More broadly the devolution process carries significant fiscal
risks such as passing unaffordable central transfers to devolved administrative units, counties not
controlling spending to fit available resources, or allowing counties to borrow without careful
regulation and oversight.
100. Disasters and insecurity, natural or man-made, can be expected to occur even
though their timing and severity typically cannot be predicted. Weather-related impacts such
as droughts need a combination of long-term preventative measures combined with emergency
responses (and on-hand resources) when they occur. Being a major exporter to the region, Kenya
could experience interruptions with trade due to the conflicts in South Sudan and continued
instability in Somalia. Trade with these economies also raises security concerns that spill across
the border, including in terms of small arms proliferations. The recent terrorist atrocities at the
Westgate Mall created great suffering but also served as an unwelcome reminder of the position
Kenya holds in being a target of such threats. Instability in the region can also displace local
populations and disrupt their livelihoods. It has a negative impact on tourism, which is Kenya’s
main foreign exchange earner. In many ways instability and insecurity create a shock to the
economy akin to that from natural sources that the Bank, IMF, and international community have
in the past been able to react to with specific instruments.
101. Other strategic risks include unexpected changes in political leadership, policy
direction, and ministerial leads in key sectors. Unexpected changes in the funding priorities of
other donors or a loss of appetite of strategic partners for IFC- and MIGA-supported deals could
also constitute a strategic risk. Each of these would require nimble re-engagement with partners
to prevent changes unduly affecting the WBG-supported program.
102. Operational risks include a worsening of the governance and corruption
environment—or stakeholders’ views and responses to such circumstances. Corruption is
corrosive and eats away at development prospects. The potential turbulence during the
devolution process, for example, may see cases of irregularities reported in some of the new
county administrations as their activities expand. Closer to home, if a major Bank engagement
was to be hit by a proven fraud, theft, or other irregularity, it will undoubtedly require
downscaling or termination of WBG work in that area and throw things off course (as has
happened in the past). The mitigating measures include (a) the thrust of this CPS to help garner
good governance, including as part of the devolution process; (b) active cooperation between
INT, the Bank, and the authorities so that preventive measures are built into project design and
allegations can be handled firmly and decisively when received; and (c) good communication
with stakeholders, including the WBG Executive Board, in order that due proportionality can be
applied in any strategic response needed by the Bank.
103. Ineffective application of good practice social and environmental safeguards could
also pose a risk to successful project implementation. This is being mitigated by a
combination of thorough preparatory work in project preparation, intensive supervision, and
longer-term support for national capacity building in this area.

CONCLUSION

104. There is an optimistic yet credible scenario for Kenya to drive forward as a success
story in Africa. Certainly there are risks which may throw Kenya off course. By mitigating such
risks, consistent with a renewed impetus to manage for results, the WBG will support Kenya’s
efforts to communicate its successes and its development story more effectively. This CPS sets
the groundwork for the WBG to help Kenya and its citizens achieve their ambitions.

Annex 1: CPS Results Framework
Overarching Goals: Sustainable Reduction in Poverty and Increased Shared Prosperity
This results framework is situated against a broad ambition of reducing poverty and promoting shared prosperity.
Even though the near-term CPS outcomes cannot really be measured on such high-level metrics, this is useful to present them as a guiding force.
Vision 2030 aspires to 10% annual GDP growth rates which are well above historical levels. This CPS aspires to contribute to average growth rates during the CPS
period. To play some part in reaching these goals, the WBG program will seek to increase productivity and improve consumption in a sustainable manner, with
particular attention to the poorest segments of society. The Devolution Agenda offers an opportunity to provide historically disadvantaged counties with greater
transfers per citizen, setting the basis for improved decentralized service delivery. This opens new opportunities to address long-standing inequalities, but also brings
new challenges that have major implications for reducing poverty and achieving shared prosperity. The CPS will contribute to address these challenges by adopting a
mainstreamed approach to better governance across all three domains of engagement.
Population: 43.18 million (2013)
Growth rate: 4% (2012)
Poverty rate: 47% (2005)

 Develop and maintain an integrated safe and efficient transport network
 Enhance private sector participation in the provision of infrastructure facilities and services strategically complemented by government

 Increase water availability in the country

Issues and Obstacles:
High growth rates alone will not have significant impact on poverty reduction without addressing equity; a more inclusive growth model that focuses on quality

This results framework measures in some extent how WBG-financed projects have a close link of influence in some of the Government of Kenya’s broader targets.

job creation is needed
Political economy around devolution, combined with growing pains of the process may impede target growth rates in the short term
Implementation problems in key sectors such as urban, energy, transport and agriculture need to be addressed
Regional integration will be important and more private sector participation is required to meet investment targets in infrastructure sectors
Kenya’s private sector is underperforming primarily due to constraints on infrastructure, investment climate, competitiveness; reforms that focus on the business
environment, access to finance for firms, and public private partnerships are essential
Economic growth and urbanization must do a better job of creating jobs and employment and internationally competitive cities
Bridging growth of demand for energy with increases in power capacity (5,000 MW by 2017) is critical and will stimulate reduction in overall electricity prices;
however the off-taker’s (KPLC) credit-worthiness needs to be safeguarded. In addition, sustainable funding mechanisms are necessary to realize the planned 2
million new household connections where citizens benefit.
Governance
Improving the governance/ enabling environment through better regulations, control of corruption, improved judiciary that impartially and speedy enforcement of
contracts and administration of justice will improve the climate for doing business and attracting investments that leads to creation of more wealth and
employment

Issues and Obstacles:
High rates of poverty persist among vulnerable groups, especially children (53.5 percent), including orphans and vulnerable children (54.1 percent).
Expenditure on safety net, including cash transfers, is still low compared to the size of the population in need. Cash transfer programs tend to be limited in size,
fragmented and are largely uncoordinated.
Maternal mortality is among the highest in Africa at 488 deaths per 100,000 live births. The proportion of women who deliver with skilled attendance is only 44
percent and has remained largely unchanged since 1993.
Over a third of Kenyan children are stunted, while 14 percent are severely stunted.
Unemployment rate for youth is double the adult average, at about 21 percent, with 28 percent of youth neither in school nor at work. Ensuring that young people
are successfully integrated into the economy and are employed will open the pathway to a demographic dividend for development that will improve Kenya’s
competitiveness, raise household incomes, reduce poverty and create a virtuous circle of investment and growth.
Livelihoods and economic activities in Kenya are highly vulnerable to climate fluctuations. The country’s inland areas are largely arid with two-thirds of the
country receiving less than 500 mm of rainfall per year, limiting the potential for agriculture.
Governance
Weak governance in sectors manifested in poor quality of public expenditure, elite capture, leakages, inefficiencies and mismanagement have impact on quality
of, and access to services and service delivery outcomes in infrastructure and social sectors (e.g. electricity, water, agriculture, health and education. The poorest
Kenyans have most difficulties accessing services due to these constraints.

Vision 2030 Goals:7
 To meet objectives outlined in the economic and social pillars, Kenya’s national governance system will be transformed and reformed to
acquire high-level executive capability consistent with a rapidly industrializing country.
 Kenya will adopt a democratic decentralization process with substantial devolution in policy-making, public resource management and
revenue sharing through devolved funds
Second Medium Term Plan 2013-2017 (MTP2) Goals:8
 To enact and operationalize policies and legal framework toward national cohesion and integration
 To establish a comprehensive framework for human rights
 To undertake various legal reforms including development, review and implementation of all legalizations relating reforms in governance,
judiciary and the rule of law

Issues and Obstacles:
Kenya’s devolution comes with high expectations for improving service delivery and bringing government closer to the people.
The devolution also carries significant risks for service delivery disruption, some already occurring.
Fiscal sustainability is threatened, especially of the wage bill is a major risk, particularly for larger urbanized counties.
Although they are the key drivers of growth, large urban counties have inherited significant payroll and debt obligations, at the same time reduced central
transfers.
Need to build county institutional capacity, especially in core county planning, PFM, and HR systems, along with basic data-driven performance monitoring,
which flags capacity gaps and reinforces county incentives to get working systems in place.
Operationalizing transparency and citizen participation in county planning, budgeting, and performance management systems as per Constitution is a major
challenge.
There is a need to build capacity of historically marginalized counties to make use of new financing. Larger per-capita transfers to arid and semi-arid counties

Annex 2: CPS Completion Report
CPS COMPLETION REPORT
COUNTRY: Kenya
COVERAGE: FY2010-2013
DATE OF PROGRESS REPORT: April 5, 2012
I.

Introduction

1. The FY2010-2013 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) was approved by the Board in
March 2010. The period covered by the CPS witnessed profound changes and some
remarkable achievements in Kenya’s political and economic governance arrangements. It
was book-ended by the adoption of a new Constitution in 2010 that limited presidential
power and set in train a far-reaching set of governance initiatives; and by the holding of a
general election in March 2013 that was among the most peaceful, with least negative
economic impact, that Kenya has ever experienced. In between these key achievements the
Government put in place the framework for one of the world’s most ambitious fiscal,
political, and administrative decentralizations. This included a Public Financial Management
Act in 2012 that has, inter alia, clarified roles and responsibilities between the Auditor
General, Controller of Budget and Treasury.
2. During this time the Government vigorously pressed forward with implementation of
its long term development strategy, Vision 2030 (launched in 2008). The strategy aims to
transform Kenya into a middle income country by 2030. Specific proposals for the period
2008-2012 are contained in the Government’s first Medium Term Plan (MTP). An interim
assessment of progress under the MTP was undertaken in 2011 and a Vision 2030 Progress
Report issued in February 2013. The FY2010-2013 CPS was closely aligned with the
priorities set out in the MTP as further detailed below.
3. This Completion Report reviews the World Bank Group’s program in Kenya during
FY2010-2013. The Report covers both program implementation and Bank performance. It
has drawn on extensive discussions with Bank Group staff members who have been involved
in the delivery of projects and investments, AAA and advisory work; a range of World Bank
documents including ICRs, ISRs and other project documents as well as reports, policy
updates, and IMF reports; the results of the 2012 Client Survey; and discussions with
Government counterparts.
4. The FY2010-2013 CPS (as amended by the CPS Progress Report in 2012) was divided
into three key pillars. The first of these, ‘Unleashing Kenya’s Growth Potential’, was
mostly achieved. Outcomes under ICT, energy, water and agriculture were all fully or mostly
achieved while those under private sector development and transport were partially achieved.
The second pillar, ‘Reducing Inequality and Strengthening Resilience’, was also mostly
achieved: the combined outcome for health, education and urban development was partially
achieved while those for environment and social protection were achieved. The third pillar,
47

‘Increasing Transparency and Accountability’, was not achieved, based on a strict reading of
the results matrix targets. However, as discussed further below, there was a wide range of
Bank–supported activity under this pillar, not fully captured by the results framework, which
supported the Government’s constitutional and governance related reforms during this
period.
5. In summary, the overall rating for Program implementation is moderately satisfactory
and that for Bank performance is good. A majority of CPS outcomes (7 out of 12) were
achieved or mostly achieved (as shown in Box 1) and therefore the overall objective rating
for the CPS Program FY2010-13 is moderately satisfactory. The design and implementation
of the program contributed successfully to the pursuit and achievement of CPS objectives
resulting in a ‘good’ assessment of bank performance.

6. The Review also points to a number of ways in which the Bank could have greater
impact going forward. These include: (i) the importance of designing projects for strategic
impact to increase the chance of project success; (ii) the opportunities that exist for
leveraging private sector finance in support of development goals through innovative use of
Bank funding; (iii) the benefits that accrue from effective cross-Bank Group working; (iv)
the need to strengthen gender representation in our M&E; (v) the need to draw on nonadministrative sources of data to enable effective monitoring and evaluation of programs; (vi)
the merit of close collaboration between Bank’s Integrity Unit (INT) and the Government’s
audit agency when investigating allegations of fraud and corruption in Bank-financed
projects.

II.

Review of Kenya’s progress toward country level goals

7. Overall progress against the targets set out in the first Medium Term Plan (covering
2008-2012) has been good. There has been good progress in all the main components of the
Plan including growth and competitiveness, service delivery and human development, and
governance.
8. Growth and macroeconomic management have been strong in recent years. Real GDP
growth in Kenya during the 4 years from 2010 to 2013 is projected to average 5%, among the
highest average rates of growth in the country of any 4 year period during the last three
decades.1 Fiscal performance has remained in line with the country’s IMF program
requirements. Tax revenue has improved as a share of GDP (driven by VAT and excise tax
collections). Meanwhile central government wages as a share of GDP remained stable which
provided additional space in the budget for increased capital expenditure.2 Inflation, despite
internal and external pressures and a number of spikes, has been kept to an average 8.1%
during 2010 to 2013 (compared with 8.9% in the previous 4 years).3 Public debt, while still
relatively high for an emerging economy, has fallen significantly4 and the financial system
remains sound.5 While poverty levels have fallen somewhat alongside the pick-up in
economic growth they are still high. The lack of any recent survey makes it difficult to
estimate poverty rates precisely.6 Based on available data, however, poverty is estimated to
have fallen from 44% in 2005 at the time of the last Household Budget Survey to between
32% and 41% by 2011, depending on how fast income inequality has fallen, with a base case
estimate of 38%. However female headed households experience an incidence of poverty that
is 5 percentage points higher than amongst male headed households.
9. Competitive conditions also improved. The regulatory environment for businesses in
Kenya improved during 2010 to 2013 although not as much as in other countries. According
to the 2012 Doing Business indicators, access to electricity and credit improved both in terms
of lower costs and shorter time required. Insolvency procedures also improved. Starting a
business also became cheaper albeit a slightly longer process. On the other hand the cost and
time required for importing and obtaining construction permits worsened. Access to finance
increased from just over 41% of the adult population in 2009 to nearly 67% in 2013 and the
underlying ratio of credit-to-GDP increased from about 32% in 2010 to about 35% in 2013.
The index of quality of trade and transport related infrastructure for Kenya edged up between
2010 and 2012. Overall performance in the transport sector improved in recent years as a
result of higher public spending in the sector.7 However although the extent of the road
network in Kenya compares favorably with its neighbours, quality needs to improve as more
than half of roads (56%) are in poor condition as a result of inadequate maintenance. The
port of Mombasa and Jomo Kenyatta International Airport perform considerably below
international standards and represent a bottleneck. The performance of railways continues to
disappoint due to dilapidated infrastructure and poor management.
10. In the energy sector Kenya has advanced rapidly (annual electricity production increased
from approximately 6900 GWh in to 7800 GWh between 2009 and 2011) although it lags
behind countries in Asia and Latin America at similar income levels. For example, the
number of households with access to electricity doubled between 2008 and 2013 to 2 million
49

customers. 8 Yet coverage at 30% is well below countries such as Ghana where it is over
50%.9 In the area of ICT a mobile revolution has swept the country in recent years.10 Access
to water increased (from 59% of households to nearly 61%) between 2009 and 2011, albeit
from a low base. Water in Kenya is a critically scarce resource. The country’s per capita
water storage capacity of 526 m3 places it in the bottom 8% of countries world-wide.
11. There were key advances in the social sectors. In health there was very good progress in
reducing communicable diseases and child mortality although key challenges remain
particularly to reduce maternal mortality and to reverse stubbornly high levels of child
stunting.11 Successive demographic health surveys show that child mortality rates declined
by over a third and the recent national immunization survey (2012) suggests that Kenya has
achieved full immunization coverage among eligible children i.e. close to 80%. The recent
Kenya AIDS indicators Survey (2012) shows that National HIV prevalence has reduced from
7.2% in 2007 to 5.6%. HIV testing has increased significantly with 72% of adults in 2012
reporting having been tested for HIV compared to 34% reported in 2007. The proportion of
sexually active youth (15 -24 years) who report having had sex with a non-spousal, nonregular partner in the past 12 months has drastically reduced from 33% and 83%
respectively for females and males (2008 KDHS) to 2.7% and 23.7%. More data will
become available when the latest Demographic and Health Survey is completed (the last one
dates from 2008). Other key achievements in recent years include the rehabilitation of 70%
of health facilities; delinking the Ministry of Health from service delivery; and the
establishment of community units to enable households and communities to take charge of
improving their own health.12 Likewise in education there has been significant progress at all
levels. The primary school net enrolment rate rose from 92.5% in 2008 to 95.3% in 2012 as
did completion rates (from 79.8% to 80.3%). Primary transition rates also improved from
64.1% to 76.6%. Enrolment rates in secondary school equivalent rose from 28.9% in 2008 to
33.1% in 2012. The number of students in university education rose from under 123,000 in
2008 to over 240,000 in 2012.
12. Kenya has also increased its focus on social protection. Social protection spending increased
steadily between 2005 and 2010 informed by a new sectoral strategy (supported by the
Bank). The coverage of cash transfer programmes has grown significantly. The Government
of Kenya’s five main cash transfer programmes ‒ the Older Persons Cash Transfer (OPCT),
the Cash Transfers to Orphans and Vulnerable Children (CT-OVC), the Hunger Safety Net
Programme (HSNP), the Urban Food Subsidy Cash Transfer (UFS-CT), and the Persons with
Severe Disability Cash Transfer (PWSD-CT) ‒ have collectively increased their coverage
more than tenfold since 2005 and currently provide regular support to 1.6 million people in
279,843 households or 4% of the population. The number of households receiving timely
payments under the OVC program, supported by the Bank, increased by over 55,000 between
2009 and 2012. With these gains, cash transfers now cover almost half (an estimated 46.6%)
of the absolute poor population, and coverage should be expanded in the future.
13. The country has taken steps to safeguard natural resources but more is required. Sound
environmental conservation measures are key to confronting the growing risks of
temperature and rainfall variability and change in Kenya. These include better water
management and increasing the area covered by forest. Currently just over 5.5% of the
50

country is covered by forest. Kenya’s Vision 2030 aims to increase the share of forest set
aside for soil, water, biodiversity, carbon sequestration and other ecological services to 10%
by 2030 from 4% in 2012. While Government Forest Plantation Stocking has increased from
112,700 hectares in 2009 to 121,700 hectares in 2011 this increase is low relative to what has
been achieved in other African countries.13 Only a small percentage of agricultural land
( 0.036%) was irrigated in 2009.
14. There has been notable progress in the area of governance. The new Constitution and
Public Financial Management (PFM) Act of 2012 helped, inter alia, clarify PFM roles and
responsibilities, assigning responsibility for confirming whether or not public money has
been applied lawfully and in an effective way to the Auditor General; authorization of
withdrawals from public funds to the Controller of Budget who reports to Parliament every 4
months; and accounting to the National and County Treasury. Other developments included
the passing of a County Government Act and establishment of 47 elected county governor
positions and county assemblies; an overhaul of the judiciary including public vetting of key
public appointments; a new Senate; legal framework and bodies needed to implement the
new Constitution; accelerated roll out of the IFMIS; consolidation of a number of
government ministries; and increased emphasis on transparency and downward
accountability to citizens (discussed further below under program performance).
15. But Kenya’s poor record on governance has a long history, runs deep and will take time
to turn around. Among Kenya’s Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA)
report scores in 2012, the degree of policy-based budgeting and predictability in budget
execution received the highest scores while accounting, recording and reporting and donor
practices received the lowest scores. Enactment of the 2012 PFM Act should help to
underpin the progress of key reforms in this area. CPIA scores for public sector management
improved slightly from 3.3 to 3.4 between 2010 and 2012. More specifically Kenya’s poor
record on transparency and accountability continue to be a constraint on development.
Kenya’s position in the 2012 Transparency International Index is 19th out of 23 among subSaharan countries that have been major recipients of Bank funding since 2000. Its CPIA
score for transparency, accountability and corruption remained at 3 during the CPS period.
Kenya’s score in the 2012 Open Budget Survey was 49 (same as 2010); in-year reporting
showing a marked improvement but there was a fall in the information made available
around the enacted budget. Problems of ineligibility of financial claims, allegations of fraud
and corruption in service delivery and district administered development projects that arose
during the previous CPS period (FY04-FY09) led to the suspension of three World Bank
projects and impacted on results during FY10-FY13. These suspensions and the actions taken
by Government and the Bank to address them are further discussed below.
III.

Highlights of program performance

16. The CPS Program in Kenya during FY10-13 achieved, or mostly achieved, the majority
of its objectives. Consequently the overall rating for program performance is moderately
satisfactory. Details of the evaluation are contained in the results matrix and highlights are
summarized below.

51

Pillar 1: Unleashing Kenya’s growth potential
17. Overall this outcome was mostly achieved with the improved business environment

outcome partially achieved; combined outcome for improved core infrastructure mostly
achieved, and enhanced agriculture productivity mostly achieved.
CPS outcome: An improved business environment and competitiveness
18. This objective was partially achieved. In particular improvements to the regulatory
environment for SMEs occurred, although not to the extent targeted in the CPS results
matrix. The CPS targets for access to finance on the other hand were fully achieved.
19. The CPS program in business environment and competitiveness was broad-based and
involved close working between the Bank and IFC. It contributed to an improvement in
Kenya’s business environment and competitiveness across a very wide front including
supporting access to finance, skills and markets for MSMEs and trade logistics assistance;
support for strategic, legal, regulatory and structural reforms in the financial sector as well as
improvements in the national payments system and in debt management; strengthening the
environment for foreign investment including support for a Special Economic Zone.
20. IFC led a number of initiatives in the area of access to finance and has played an
important role enabling Kenya’s banks to increase their lending to SMEs. IFC senior loans in
2011-2013 to Co-op Bank ($60 million), KCB ($140 million) and Equity Bank ($100
million) all represented fresh engagements (an earlier relationship with KCB had ended in
the mid-1990s). These loans helped banks diversify their funding sources, reduce balance
sheet risk, and increase their lending to SMEs. IFC also financed banks with a unique market
niche, with the potential to drive innovation and address underserved markets. An example of
this is IFC’s $5 million equity investment in December 2012 in Gulf African Bank (GAB),
Kenya's first shariah-compliant bank. This investment gave GAB added credibility in the
market, helping it expand an important banking niche. IFC also supported banks to increase
lending to the real sector - e.g. agribusiness and infrastructure. IFC also provided 21 trade
finance guarantees to nine banks – starting with $36.6 million in FY10 and reaching $163
million in FY12 thereby supporting external trade and boosting bank liquidity.
CPS outcome: Improved core infrastructure with deeper regional integration: transport,
energy, water, ICT
21. Overall this objective was mostly achieved reflecting objectives that were partially
achieved in the transport sector, mostly achieved in the energy and water sectors and fully
achieved in the ICT sector.
22. The CPS transport program had notable successes in roads but progress was uneven
elsewhere. The Bank’s program in transport focused on the rehabilitation and improvement
of roads, road facilities and road safety interventions; strengthening institutional capacity in
the transport sector including the airport and civil aviation sectors; and IFC financing of an
upgrade of Kenya Airway’s five-year fleet and network expansion plan and of improvements
to the rolling stock and infrastructure associated with the Kenya-Uganda railway managed by
52

Rift Valley Railways International. Within the road sector Bank support has focused on the
main road transport arteries with links to neighboring countries to boost trade and regional
integration (i.e. the Northern road (920 km) and Tanzania-Kenya-South Sudan road (894 km)
corridors) which are about 1,814 km. These routes represent an economic lifeline for Kenya
and the East Africa region. As a result of this support the condition of the Mombasa-Malaba
section of the Northern Corridor road in Kenya has shown a marked improvement (with the
share of the road in fair or good condition rising from 54% to 80%) and travel times have
fallen (e.g. it used to take approximately 8 hours by car from Nairobi to Mombasa and now
takes in the region of 5 hours). The time required to export and import containers has also
improved, modestly. In addition the Rift Valley Railways project suffered from weak
financial and managerial capabilities, an under-estimate of the extent of asset dereliction and
post-election violence in 2008. IFC successfully led a restructuring of the project during the
FY10-FY13 CPS period, bringing in new investors and an operator as well as an experienced
consultant to advise the concessionaire. Consequently, although the quantity of freight
carried by railways has declined rather than increased as projected during the period of the
current CPS, the outlook is now more positive. Overall the CPS objective was partially
achieved in transport.
23. In the energy sector, the Bank’s Program has sought to boost private sector
participation as well as the share of energy generated from renewable energy.
Comprising both IDA and IFC lending, IFC advisory services and IDA and MIGA risk
mitigation the Program has helped increase geothermal generating capacity (on course to
more than double the country’s geothermal capacity) and improved transmission and
distribution networks; strengthened the policy and regulatory framework; and helped
establish the feasibility of a number of investment projects. As a result more than half a
million households obtained electricity connections, vastly in excess of CPS targets. IDA,
IFC and MIGA have also worked together effectively to support private sector thermal,
geothermal and wind generation. For example IFC financed two private sector financed
power generation projects, MIGA provided political risk insurance cover for two, and IDA
provided partial credit guarantees for four. IFC and IDA also provided financing for KPLC’s
investment program, the state-owned electricity distribution company. Overall the number of
new independent power projects established exceeded CPS targets albeit with slightly fewer
in the geothermal sector than projected. Although transmission losses increased during the
CPS period this was overall outweighed by major success on the other two quantitative
indicators for energy suggesting an overall rating of mostly achieved.
24. The Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) was highly integrated with the CPS urban
program. WSP has primarily supported three of the country’s seven water boards in the
rehabilitation of multiple aspects of water supply, sewerage networks and treatment facilities,
the provision of equipment and technical assistance to improve the overall operations of all
three Boards. As a result there has been a large increase in the number of people with access
to improved water and adequate sewerage services. (Note that the baseline data for the two
water and sanitation sector CPS indicators has been corrected to bring it into line with data
made available in 2008 after the WASSIP project appraisal document which was the source
of data for the CPS. This was not updated in the CPS PR due to an oversight.) Overall the
CPS objective was mostly achieved in the water and sanitation sector.
53

25. The CPS program in ICT included strategic interventions to increase Kenya’s external
connectivity as well as increasing the number of internet users within the country. It
included the important EASSy Cable project (IFC Portfolio project with Bank support) as
well as IFC’s KMIP (IFC Special Economic Zone Project). The introduction of the EASSy
cable demonstrated to other investors that the laying of sub-marine cables was a viable
investment. Today there are four cables while five years ago there were none. There is
approximately 20 times as much data now being transmitted and prices are approximately 10
times lower than they were.
26. Internally, the Bank also helped stimulate demand for data by buying capacity to
connect university campuses across the country. This led to an increase in megabytes and
fall in unit prices. Overall the Bank’s technical strategy was very sound. Internal prices have
also fallen but not as much.
27. In the area of internet usage the Bank’s role was to encourage and support the
Government through its on-going policy dialogue; as well as implementation of the
Regional Communications Infrastructure Project, KTCIP. The regional dimension of
this project helped give the Bank added profile (although this was also a challenge). Overall
the CPS objective was achieved in ICT.
CPS outcome: Enhanced agricultural productivity with a focus on food security
28. This objective was mostly achieved in terms of the specific indicators contained within the
CASPR results matrix, but achieving a broader impact in the sector remains a challenge for
the Bank Group.
29. Bank Group support to the agricultural sector was aimed at supporting: 1) the
generation, dissemination and adoption of agricultural technology; 2) a package of
measures to improve basic services and livelihoods in arid and semi-arid lands; and 3)
the provision of finance to key private sector organizations operating in the
agribusiness sector. Bank support largely comprised support for policy and institutional
reforms, extension system reform, agricultural research system reform and farmer client
empowerment; and targeted support to the poorest farmers in the country’s 28 arid and semiarid land districts including natural resource and drought management techniques and other
community level capacity building.
30. The overall performance of agriculture has been variable due in large part to an over-reliance
on rain-fed agriculture. For example average cereal yields declined from 1710 kg/ha in 2010
to 1659 kg/ha in 2012. However as a result of WBG initiatives maize yields, a key
weakness in the agricultural sector, increased by over 7% in targeted areas. Tea,
horticulture and dairy have performed considerably better than food crops. Storage capacity
for tea was given a boost by IFC’s financing of a Mombasa warehouse facility.
31. Across the country there has been some improvement in overall indicators of food security.
For example the depth of the food deficit was reduced from 213 calories in 2010 to 201
calories in 2012. The share of the population experiencing undernourishment fell from 31.8%
54

in 2010 to 30.4% in 2011. As a result of WBG initiatives earnings of small holders farmers,
men and women, in specific product sub-sectors increased during the period of the CPS
albeit by amounts less than those targeted. Male incomes remained three times higher than
female incomes. Bank support for farmers in arid and semi-arid land, however, was
interrupted: based on an understanding of preliminary findings of an Institutional Integrity
(INT) forensic audit, in July 2010 management informally suspended IDA financing for
ALRMP II, and the suspension remained in place through closing on December 31, 2010.
The implications of this for the CPS are further discussed below under the Governance Pillar.
32. In addition, IFC, for which agribusiness and food security have become a strategic
priority in Kenya, booked two agribusiness transactions in FY10-FY13 for a total $22
million in long term debt. In October 2012, IFC committed a $12 million loan to the
privatized Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA) to build a 200,000-square-foot
warehouse in Mombasa. The warehouse will increase revenues for KTDA, ultimately
benefitting the 562,000 farmers who are the agency’s shareholders. IFC agreed a $10 million
loan to ETC Group, an agricultural supply chain manager and food processor, in June 2013.
33. IFC’s financial markets and agribusiness departments also jointly funded local banks
to channel financing to Kenyan farms. For instance, a seven-year, $60 million senior loan
in December 2012 to Cooperative Bank of Kenya requires it to direct about $10 million to
agribusiness clients.
34. Despite the examples of success noted above it is clear that the poor performance of the
food sector as a whole, particularly with respect to maize, remains a major challenge.
Understanding whether and how the Bank can help meet this challenge is an important prior
condition for any future Bank involvement in the sector. This is further discussed under
lessons and suggestions below.
Pillar 2: Reducing inequality and strengthening resilience.
35. Overall this outcome was mostly achieved with the combined outcome for health,
education and urban development partially achieved and those for environment and social
protection achieved.
CPS outcome: Better access to health care, education, and basic infrastructure services
36. The Bank’s health program during FY10-FY13 targeted an improvement in the
delivery of basic health services and in the efficiency of pharmaceutical planning,
processes and management. The Bank’s main lending instrument was a health SWAp. This
included two core reforms started by the Government of Kenya: namely a) direct facility cash
transfers to ensure timely availability of resources and enable local policy relevant planning;
and b) establishment of a system of demand-based drawing rights for Essential Medicines
and Medical Supplies to respond to actual needs and reduce wastage. It also included 5
pilots. Two of these showed good progress namely a) social accountability and b) results
based financing.

55

37. In addition IFC’s Health in Africa Initiative (launched in 2007), a multi-country advisory
service targeting legal, regulatory, and institutional reforms in the health sector, led to
enactment of legislation in Kenya in 2012 creating equal opportunity for public and private
healthcare providers and is expected to result in expanded coverage for up to 20 million
Kenyans.
38. Overall the health CPS outcome was partially achieved. Two of the four health sector
CPS targets have been fully achieved: firstly 38.9 million people – of which 21.3 million are
females - now have access to basic services against a target of 18.3 million. This is confirmed
by the recent household survey on health care utilization and expenditure. The preliminary
results of the survey has shown that per-capita outpatient utilization increased from 1.9 visits
to 3.1 visits from 2003 to 2013 and the share of those who reported sick but not sought health
care reduced from 22.8 to 12.7% during the same period. The inpatient admissions also
increased from 15 to 38 per 1000 population. There were no inequities noted for outpatient
care while inequities continue for in-patient care. More importantly, the public sector remains
the main source of care with the exception of the richest quintile. Secondly 97.3% of
facilities receiving HSSF grants meet core financial management requirements have
improved FM (against a target of 50%). There was an error in the target for immunization of
children aged less than 1 year which should have been 1.23 million and not 1.8 million which
is greater than the entire birth cohort of 1.5 million. The actual result was 1.11 million (partly
because of disruption of services in the north-east of the country because of tensions with
Somalia). Hence this target is partially achieved. Recent National Immunization survey data
suggests full immunization coverage of 80%.
39. The target for use of condoms by youth, both male and female, was partially achieved
according to the Kenya AIDS Indicators Survey (KAIS 2012). The Proportion of youth aged
15-24 reporting condom use in the last sexual encounter with a non-regular partner increased from
24% and 47% (2009) to 48.7% and 58.7% respectively for females and males. While this is a notable
increase, especially among women, the targets set (55% and 75%) could not be fully
achieved. While administrative data is improving, there are still challenges in timely and

complete reporting. In future, the Bank will aim to obtain population based statistics by
financing surveys to obtain more reliable estimates of this indicator.
40. The Bank’s overall objective in the education sector was to improve basic education
ensuring equity of access and enhancing quality and learning achievement as well as
providing opportunities for further education and training and improving sector
management. The Bank’s main instrument was the Education Sector Support Project.
However IDA disbursements for the project were effectively suspended in July 2009 due to
emerging evidence of fraud and corruption and the project was formally closed in December
2010, a year ahead of schedule. The ICR for the project, completed in September 2011,
found that the project was unsatisfactory due to non-achievement of the majority of PDO
indicators at the time of assessment i.e. December 2010. In addition, in June 2010 IFC
committed a $4 million loan to Braeburn Group of Schools which operates 13 private
kindergarten, primary, and high schools across seven campuses in Kenya and Tanzania
serving over 3,000 students. IFC’s financing helped Braeburn expand technical and
vocational training, and invest in teacher training and professional staff development, a
modest but still important contribution to progress in this area. This includes a partnership
56

with Kenyatta University on specially designed graduate education courses to increase the
availability of highly qualified teaching staff in Kenya and Tanzania.
41. The specific CPS targets for education were partially achieved: a) primary completion
rates rose from 79.5% in 2008 to 80.3% by 2012; b) primary to secondary education
transition rates rose from 64.1% to 76.6% by 2012; and c) there was a near doubling in the
number of students attending university. The overall assessment for the sector is that the CPS
objective was partially achieved. The implications of the early closure of the project because
of irregularities are further discussed under the governance section below.
42. The Bank’s primary objective in the area of urban development was to improve living
conditions in informal settlements in selected municipalities in Kenya. This was to be
achieved by enhancing security of tenure and improving infrastructure based on plans
developed in consultation with the community. The Bank’s program in the area of slum
upgrading included institutional support to the Ministries of Housing and Land and a number
of local authorities; help implementing the new national land policy in informal urban
settlements; financing for a range of investments in roads, walkways, public spaces and the
like, and involved close collaboration with the Bank’s program of investment in water and
sanitation in Nairobi, Mombasa and Malindi as well as its investments in increasing access to
electricity.
43. The largest part of the Bank’s program, namely the works investment program, was
significantly delayed. Consequently the target of providing access to improved
infrastructure services for 50,000 has not been achieved. The cause of the delay in
completing preparatory work was primarily due to unrealistic target-setting on the Bank’s
side combined with some delays due to weak counterpart capacity. In particular, the project
was designed as a framework project, yet there were no activities that were ready to
appraise/implement when the project was approved; community consultation and design
work only started during implementation; and there was no advance procurement. Given that
the project was approved in February 2011 it is clear that even under a best scenario results
were unlikely to materialize until at least 3 years later i.e. more than 6 months after the end of
the FY10-FY13 CPS period. Weak counterpart capacity resulting in delays in payments to
the consortium added some additional months to the overall delay.
CPS outcome: establishing comprehensive, scalable social protection mechanisms
44. As a first step toward achieving the CPS outcome for social protection the Bank
focused on supporting the development of a national social protection framework and
providing specific support to orphans and vulnerable children. This objective was
achieved with support from the Bank on two main fronts: a program of private sector
internships together with policy support for the Ministry of Youth and Sports; and a major
and innovative program of cash transfers targeting orphans and vulnerable children. Both
programs achieved their targets and more. The Bank’s social protection program benefited
from a sustained analytical effort to understand the priorities in the sector which resulted in a
social protection strategy that was adopted by the Government as their own. Building on this

57

success the priority now is to consolidate the many cash transfer and safety net initiatives that
are administered by different government departments.
CPS outcome: improved management of key natural resources and adapting to climate change
45. This objective was achieved. The Bank’s program has focused on extending the area of land
under irrigation by rehabilitating existing networks and constructing new ones; as well as
increasing the area of forest managed in accordance with approved forest management plans.
An additional 8270 ha of land was brought under irrigation as a result of WBG efforts. An
additional 320,000 ha of forests were brought under management in target areas. The Bank
also supported this objective through its work supporting farmers in drought and natural
resource management techniques in arid and semi-arid land districts (also noted above under
agriculture).
Pillar 3: Increasing Transparency and Accountability
CPS outcome: improved transparency and accountability
46. At the time of the CASPR governance was reconstituted as a separate pillar in order to
highlight its importance. Based on the indicators contained within the CPS PR (April 2012)
the objective of the new pillar was not achieved.
47. The Bank was active in a number of areas in support of these indicators. It supported the
Government in strengthening budget processes, public financial management including
auditing, procurement, revenue mobilization, parliamentary oversight and institutional
capacity building in ministries; as well as institutional strengthening at municipal level. The
Bank’s main project in this area included a wide range of PDO and intermediate outcome
indicators which included the CPS indicators of timely financial statement (partially
achieved) and external audit preparation and publication (not achieved). Slower than
expected progress in achieving these indicators was due in part to delays in putting in place
the requisite infrastructure at both central and local levels. The third indicator, improvement
in Kenya’s PEFA score, was not achieved.
48. In fact the Bank’s activities in this area go well beyond those summarized in the
CASPR indicators and delivered through the projects listed in the results framework.
Although not explicitly captured by the CPS targets, the Bank has also played an important
role in the area of decentralization via the Fiscal Decentralization Knowledge Program (now
scaled up into a $6.5 million Kenya Accountable Devolution program financed by the
Governance Partnership Facility, GPF, with support from AusAID and DFID); has
established itself as a leading external partner on devolution; issued multiple pieces of
analysis on devolution; and is supporting judicial reform. The Bank supported the
Government as convenor, facilitator and catalyst in support of the Government’s Open Data
Initiative, launched in July 2011, which has propelled Kenya to center stage among
developing country efforts to release government data, making over 400 datasets available to
the public through the opendata.go.ke government portal. The initial Innovation Fund award
of $100,000 catalyzed other financing, and ownership of open data outreach was increasingly
shouldered by Kenyan partners. Similarly the Bank supported the GoK through provision of
58

input on international best practice in Access to Information and data protection, and
provided comments on the draft 2012 Freedom of Information and Data Protection Bills
before they were submitted to Cabinet for debate. None of these Bank activities is fully
captured by the existing CPS indicators. In part they speak to Bank performance. But they
also point to the fact that a significant share of the very positive governance developments
that occurred at national level are also to some degree CPS program successes.
49. During this period the Bank worked closely with Government to investigate and
respond to a number of financial losses flowing from irregularities arising prior to the
FY10-FY13 CPS. In September 2009, i.e. several months prior to Board approval of the
FY10-FY13 CPS, the government's Internal Audit Department (IAD) concluded a forensic
audit of the Kenya Education Sector Support Project (KESSP) and the Western Kenya
Community Driven Development (CDD) project, finding substantial questionable spending,
and possible fraud and corruption, under each project. Disbursements were immediately
suspended and work undertaken to determine what caused the integrity failures, whether
systemic issues contributed, and how such systemic issues could best be addressed. During
this period, the Bank's Integrity Vice Presidency (INT) conducted and finalized a forensic
audit of phase two of the Arid Lands Management Project, presenting its findings to the
government in April 2011. In this case, project disbursements were informally suspended in
July 2010, based on a verbal communication of INT's initial findings. KESSP and Arid
Lands both closed in December 2010, as scheduled, without resuming disbursements but
Western Kenya CDD has resumed operations, after a 16-month suspension, with (inter alia) a
new professionally-recruited project implementation unit.
50. The excellent and exhaustive work by Government and Bank teams (described further
in the next section) in response to these irregularities have reduced the incidence of
fraud and corruption and ineligible expenditures from 15 projects in FY11/12 to only
one project in FY12/13. This work has also been recognized by the OPCS Governance and
Corruption (GAC) team at the Bank and included in its database for wider reference.
Starting in the fall of 2010, the suspended Western Kenya CDD project underwent a major
restructuring, based on a detailed governance and anti-corruption plan developed in response
to the audit findings, that included appointment of an independent fiduciary agent, new
project procedures and manuals on record-keeping, reporting, transparency (including
signboards, participation, complaints handling system); a vehicle tracking system was put in
place, and a system was set up to geo-map all sub-projects (CDD, local development, flood
mitigation). Using "home-grown" GAC FM mechanisms with support from the GPF, and
relying on country systems and government institutions the Government and Bank teams
have turned a project that was suspended in 2009, before Board approval of the FY10-FY13
CPS, on account of fraud and corruption into the CDD project in Kenya with the most robust
FM systems.
51. New governance measures were also applied to other projects in the Kenya portfolio.
Independent fiduciary agents were put in place for three other projects (Health Sector
Support Project-HSSF, Total War on Aids, Cash Transfers for Orphans and Vulnerable
Children). Supervision of project record-keeping and accounting was intensified across the
portfolio with a particular focus on CDD and local service delivery components. Governance
59

and social accountability measures on transparency, participation, and complaints handling
were strengthened in HSSF, the Kenya Coastal Development Program, the Kenya Youth
Empowerment Program, and the Natural Resource Management project.
IV.

Review of Bank performance

52. Bank performance during the Kenya FY2010-13 CPS was good. Both program design
and implementation successfully contributed to CPS objectives, with minor weaknesses, and
there is a sound program of ongoing activities.
Design of the CPS
53. The CPS as a whole was highly relevant and well aligned with the key building blocks of
Kenya’s long term development strategy, Vision 2030, and the specific priorities contained
within the MTP. This is particularly true for transport, energy, water and sanitation, ICT,
health and social protection. In the area of agriculture, although the CPS results were mostly
achieved, the Bank program could have given greater emphasis to supporting reform of the
regulatory and enabling environment, particularly in the food sector.
54. The results framework was in general strong and avoided the common problem of an
excessive number of outcomes. The three pillars that focused on growth, social inclusion
and governance were highly appropriate. Most CPS outcomes aimed to achieve incremental
improvements in particular economic or social objectives. In one case, social protection, the
CPS objective of establishing comprehensive, scalable social protection mechanisms was
perhaps over-ambitious given the complexity of the challenge facing the Bank particularly
given the low knowledge base from which the Bank was initially starting. Some baseline data
(e.g. in the water and sanitation sector) and targets (e.g. in the health sector) that required
adjusting were overlooked at the time of the CPS PR but have been adjusted now.
55. But in some areas such as governance, some highly strategic and significant Bank
activities were not well captured by indicators in the results framework. In this area, the
Bank was active in a wide range of activities, many of which were supported by a GPF trust
fund for Kenya initiated in late 2010. Some of these activities are described above in the
previous section (paragraphs 44-45). As a result, although the CPS outcomes were not
achieved this is not considered to be a major short coming for the purposes of rating the CPS.
As discussed above part of the Bank’s work involved responding to issues arising from the
pre-CPS period. Project-level governance issues in Kenya thus received high-level visibility
from WB management and the Executive Directors, requiring significant resources and
attention by the country team. In the new CPS it will be important for the Bank and GoK to
translate the lessons learned into joint work on building improved government systems for
public financial management, procurement, transparency, and oversight at the national and
subnational levels.
56. Although gender issues were highlighted in the FY10-FY13 CPS, gender-specific
dimensions were not incorporated in any of the formulated CPS outcomes. The CPS
highlighted gender disparities as shown by relatively low employment rates, income levels,
60

political representation, access to land and agricultural support services; and relatively high
shares of household and caring duties as well as overall poverty levels. It focused on the role
that gender mainstreaming can and has played in the agricultural sector. Gender specific
targets were set and partially achieved in agriculture and health. Disaggregated data was also
collected in education and social protection. This suggests that there are opportunities in the
forthcoming CPS to consider a more systematic inclusion of gender disaggregated indicators
e.g. in additional sectors where women are disproportionately excluded such as access to
finance, governance, and water and sanitation.
57. In ICT the target of 3 million users of internet services was in hindsight clearly too
modest (given the actual outcome of over 16 million). However, given the information that
was available at the time that the targets were set, it is not obvious that a different target
should have been chosen.
Implementation of the CPS
58. Overall, the Bank’s project portfolio performed well, with 82% of projects on-track to
meet their end-project targets based on the Development Objective (DO) rating in the last
Implementation Status and Results Report (ISR) before end FY13. The likelihood that
projects would achieve the PDO as rated Marginally Satisfactory (MS)/Satisfactory (S) for
DO increased from 80% of the portfolio in FY09 to 94% in FY13. The trend was similar with
respect to Implementation Progress (IP): implementation of 94% of the portfolio was either
MS/S compared to 80% in FY09 as at end FY13. There was only one problem project by end
FY13 in the portfolio, down from three in FY12, namely the Kenya Youth Employment
Project which was restructured to cancel one component because of challenges related to
financial management (FM) and implementation. Disbursements have remained low during
the CPS period, but showed improvement in the last year of the CPS – increasing from $160
million in FY09 to $229 million in FY11 and $397 million in FY13. Both the Bank and GoK
teams have made good efforts toward cancelling IDA funds from slow disbursing and nonperforming projects and re-allocating them to other good performing and fast disbursing
projects in the Kenya portfolio. Between FY12 and FY14 SDR 62.6 million of IDA funds
were cancelled from six projects and reallocated to other well-performing projects in the
Kenya portfolio.
59. The FY10-FY13 CAS identified a number of risks to the program and mitigating
measures. These included: political uncertainty arising from elections and the need to remain
flexible in its programming; a reversal or slowing of macroeconomic progress and the need
to ensure that projects underwent thorough cost benefit analysis; exposure to external shocks
and the need to maintain sound macroeconomic management; vulnerability to climate change
and the need to support the Government in undertaking adaptation measures; terrorism and
the need to remain vigilant; and project management and fiduciary risks and the need to
provide bespoke training, undertake regular supervision and learn the lessons of the previous
CAS. In practice, as already noted above, the political and macroeconomic environment was
remarkably steady throughout the CAS. Environmental stresses have continued to play a role
but the Bank has been active along the lines anticipated in the CAS. Finally the problems

61

relating to project management and fiduciary issues that arose in the previous period have if
anything resulted in stronger systems and processes during the FY10-FY13 CAS.
60. Kenya is now one of IFC’s most important markets in Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly
for its global financial markets franchise. Kenya is IFC’s fourth largest exposure in the SubSahara region with a committed and outstanding portfolio at the end of FY13 of $702.5
million, and IFC’s 17th largest global market. The Corporation and its investment partners
committed $860.9 million to clients in the country during FY10-FY13 in transactions with 26
clients. Energy was particularly important for IFC in Kenya with commitments of $121
million in six projects during FY10-FY13. IFC investment partners committed $27 million of
this in a single $53.8 million infrastructure deal with Gulf Power Ltd intended to support
development of an 80 MW heavy fuel oil diesel plant in Nairobi. Nevertheless IFC’s
activities in Kenya are fairly recent and have accelerated rapidly in a short period of time. As
a result, most projects in the portfolio are still either under development, or have not
generated more than two years of development impact data. In many cases it is therefore still
too early to tell how IFC operations have benefited women, farmers, or MSMEs among
others.
61. There were examples of outstanding analytical and advisory (AAA) work notably in the
area of social protection where the Bank invested strongly in deepening its understanding of
the sector and did so in a manner that enabled the Government to publish the Bank’s
economic and sector work as its own. In agriculture more investment in AAA might have
positioned the Bank to play a more strategic role in shaping the policy environment in the
food sector. IFC’s Advisory Services (AS) arm has also played significant role in Kenya,
with $29.8 million in total project expenditures during the CPS period, the largest in the
region. Investment Climate work is a major part of AS caseload in Kenya, with four projects
underway in FY13, compared with two in FY10. Project spending in the period was $8.5
million. Operations included work on streamlining national regulations, work with local
authorities, and support for regional integration.
62. As already noted in the section above, the Bank’s governance team was extensively
involved in putting in place robust fiduciary mechanisms at project level that have since
been recognized by GAC team as excellent practice. In addition, more WB staff resources
were devoted to governance: a senior social development specialist was recruited starting in
Sept 2010 to review the governance weaknesses emerging from the forensic audits and help
GoK counterparts and task team leaders strengthen governance in CDD and local service
delivery projects. A lead public sector/governance specialist was recruited; and extended
consultancies were put in place (funded by TFs) to review CDD (see below) and to
strengthen social accountability, transparency, complaints handling in WKCDD and Health
projects and related government systems. Led by the CMU, a cross-sectoral governance
team was put together in 2012 to review and strengthen these governance measures across
the portfolio.
63. Work was also initiated to scale up the lessons from the problem projects into
government systems. In response to a request from Treasury, a detailed review of fiduciary
issues in WB portfolio involving CDD and decentralized expenditures was conducted. Based
62

on this review, the WB team together with the Ministry of Finance developed a draft GoK
CDD policy that lays out the key principles and actions to reduce governance risks. The Bank
team also placed a strong emphasis on governance in the devolution technical assistance and
analysis (especially around PFM, transparency, accountability).
64. In general there was a good level of trust and dialogue between the Bank and the GoK
as well as with the donor community in general. In those instances where projects resulted
in fraud and corruption the GoK was quick to react. For example in KESSP, the
strengthening of KENAO and IAD were key ingredients in uncovering the fraud and
corruption that occurred. Without these, it is unlikely that the fraud and corruption would
have been discovered at that time. However it remains unclear whether as a result of the
investigations that have since occurred those responsible have been held to full account.
65. As with most country programs, there are examples of project preparation starting, but
then having to be re-timetabled or discontinued. For example the Bank initially suspended
preparation of a judicial performance improvement project on the basis that Government
support for the project was likely to be stronger following approval of a new, progressive
Constitution in August 2010. Project preparation resumed in 2011 once enabling conditions
had improved and a new Judicial Performance Improvement project was approved in FY13.
Re-timetabling or discontinuing projects during preparation helped avoid implementation
problems that might have emerged at a later stage. Such decisions were generally taken as
swiftly as possible although the decision by IDA and IFC not to finance the Nairobi toll road
project, which also involved private sector investors, took about one year.
V.

Key lessons and suggestions

66. The importance of scale and strategic scope. An example where the Bank was able to
engage the GoK at a highly strategic level was in social protection on the back of its AAA
work. The Bank’s AAA work helped provide a solid foundation for its future program of
work in the sector, built credibility with the Government and with partners, and created a
shared vision and framework for interventions. However in agriculture the Bank did not
address the major strategic issue of regulation of the food sector and hence did not have an
impact on the all-important issue of excessive maize prices. Some aspects of the finance and
private sector development program appeared to fall beneath the GoK’s radar. Analysis of
IEG ratings of Kenya projects supports this lesson. Since at least 1990 the percentage of
project outcomes rated MS or better has been consistently below the regional average and
within this it appears that larger projects (i.e. those over $100 million) are twice as likely to
be rated moderately satisfactory as smaller projects. Projects that close on time have also
done better than those that continue beyond 5 years. Ratings of Bank and Borrower
performance have also been below regional averages.
67. Effective Bank group collaboration. Collaboration within the Bank works best where
actors each bring something different to the table. In the area of business regulation and
access to finance IFC and the Bank have worked in tandem to improve the business
environment for MSMEs. In the energy sector there was good collaboration between the
Bank, IFC and MIGA in the creation of a number of new Independent Power Producers
63

through a combination of financing, partial credit guarantees, political risk insurance and
advisory services. In railways collaboration also worked well (even though the project
encountered difficulties) with IFC providing finance and IDA dealing with 70,000
resettlements. IFC and the Bank are also working side by side in the agribusiness and health
sectors albeit IFC’s involvement is relatively recent.
68. The need to strengthen M&E. M&E systems in Kenya have improved, particularly with
respect to the production of data and progress reports, however, quality and the use of the
result information in decision-making remains a challenge. Throughout the CPS period the
Bank provided financial and technical assistance to strengthen M&E systems at
national/sectoral and decentralized (district/county) levels. This was achieved through a
number of lending operations at sector level, including the STATCAP project. High level
technical assistance focused on support formulating the new M&E Policy and strengthening
the Annual Progress Reports to include a greater emphasis on dissemination and use in
planning, budgeting and program/project implementation.
69. The CPS results framework could have been stronger in two respects: 1) gender and 2)
alignment of results with activities. With respect to gender, although the CPS highlighted the
issue of gender and included gender specific targets in two sectors, agriculture and health, it
did not mainstream gender across the results matrix. Without – at least - gender specific
targets in key sectors there is inevitably a significant risk that Bank Group attention to this
critical issue will slip. More generally there were several instances, most notably under
governance, where the results set out in the results framework were not well-aligned with the
Bank program and failed properly to reflect the wide front across which the Bank was active.
70. The importance of clearly signalling, particularly in projects involving private finance,
the likely time, cost and Government supervisory implications of Bank Group due
diligence requirements. In its September 2013 Investment Prospectus the Government of
Kenya states that it will approach IDA for partial risk guarantees (PRGs) to help encourage
private investment into a pipeline of privately financed electricity and other infrastructure
generation projects. In order to provide such PRGs the Bank would require independent
professional assessments to be carried out, as part of its due diligence requirements, to ensure
that projects proposed are consistent with least-cost development planning and realistic
growth assumptions. In order that all parties fully understand these requirements, and to
avoid possible misunderstanding and disappointment, it will be important for the Bank to
clearly signal at an early stage what these due diligence requirements are, how long they are
likely to take and cost implications. It will also be important to ensure that there is sufficient
capacity to commission and supervise these due diligence requirements within the relevant
government ministries, utilities and other corporate bodies.
71. In addition to the insights and lessons that emerge from ICRs and discussions with
Bank staff, as well as IEG analysis, the Bank’s stakeholders have also provided a range
of insights through the latest client survey undertaken in 2012. Some challenges
emerging from the survey include the following: the 3rd highest priority for poverty
reduction according to stakeholders is job creation and employment; yet this is the sector
where stakeholders rate the Bank second lowest. Second, while the Bank values gender, the
64

environment and natural resource management, these do not appear to be prioritised by
stakeholders to the same extent. Third, agriculture and education are two of the top three
sectors for poverty reduction and growth according to stakeholders. Yet in some respects,
and for reasons discussed above in this CASCR, the Bank has struggled to have an impact in
these sectors during FY10-13. Each of these insights are useful challenges for the new CPS.

Leveraging private finance into hard to reach areas: It is
possible to leverage commercial finance into hard-toreach, peri-urban areas with IDA money by a) subsidizing
the cost of finance (provided by local finance institutions)
available to utilities (to pay contractors) and b) financing
the upfront construction of household distribution
networks so that households are immediately in a position
to start consuming and paying for water and hence
enabling the utility to repay the debt incurred in the initial

Complexity: The design of the Regional Communications
project was overly complex initially and under-staffed.
This was fixed by increasing the management resources
available. Future project design should aim to do fewer
things but do them well.

MOSTLY
Enabling environment: The CPS was right to focus on
productivity, but it should have given greater attention to
the enabling environment i.e. policy reform, especially in
food. For example in the food sector most farmers are a)
net buyers of maize and b) tend to sell in bulk at harvest
time when prices are low and buy throughout the year
when prices are higher. In addition prices have been above
world prices because of lack of access to world markets.
Value added and income security: Key areas that need
more focus are: extension and helping farmers to go up
the value chain. Also there is too much vulnerability to
rain fed agriculture and hence climatic swings.
Bank team: the Bank could have done more to support the
client on FM issues as well as technical aspects egg in the
area of agribusiness. There was a limited budget for
supervision and a limited pool of skills to draw on within
the Bank. The team was basically too small

Lessons and suggestions for the new CPS




WBG collaboration: Collaboration within the Bank is
most effective where each member of the team is bringing
something new. E.g. the devolution agenda is encouraging
a more effective working partnership between PREM and
the health sector around issues of local management of
services. Similarly drawing on WBI and IFC expertise for
capacity building and PPPs respectively is also very
useful.
Donor collaboration: Collaboration with other donors can
be challenging when only a limited # of partners are
pooling in the SWAp and organizational approaches of
partners vary.

approaches in FM, procurement and auditing systems.
NGOs as monitors: There are many NGOs, CBOs and
research institutions in Kenya with good technical
expertise, as demonstrated during the earlier years of
KESSP that could have participated more in monitoring
program achievements.
Over-reliance on administrative data: A near exclusive
reliance on MoE information systems which were weak
and uncoordinated made it difficult to generate robust
indicators necessary for planning and supporting
effectiveness and efficiency in resource targeting and
utilization. This can be mitigated by: (i) ensuring that
there is an effectively functioning EMIS; (ii) using
periodic independent school sample surveys for schoollevel indicators and household surveys to supplement
EMIS; (iii) developing incentives (and sanctions) for
schools and the MoE to report accurately; and (v)
undertaking more independent analytical work

Client engagement: Overall key lessons include: a) the

enable relationship building; c) the importance of listening
to the client to really understand their objectives.
Fiduciary capacity: The cause of the delay in completing
preparatory work was the poor quality of drafting of the
contracts for the work which resulted in delays in payment
of key members of the consortium of firms involved and
hence delays in implementation of the work. This in turn

Lessons and suggestions for the new CPS
in the portfolio and as a pillar in itself. Because of the
various INT cases the Bank has tended to approach
governance and anti-corruption with a narrow focus on
technical fiduciary issues at a project level. However the
root causes of the INT cases were often deeper issues
relating to governance and political economy especially
vested interests and conflicts between interests, not just at
project level but more broadly at the sector and national
level. The INT cases were reflections of symptoms of
weak institutions and need to address this more broadly
not on case by case basis.
 Fiduciary risks of devolution: INT cases also sometimes
arose when funds were devolved to district levels resulting
in capture of funds by elite groups. E.g. this was the case
with the Western Kenya CDD. This requires mitigation
through improved oversight mechanisms that are more
transparent and involve a broader group of interests.
Focusing more on these mechanisms at a local level will
be key as the devolution agenda gathers pace. Increasing
participation in decision making and reducing discretion
by officials will go some way to improve accountability.
 PMU: PFMRS suffered from lack of a) mandated
authority to give instructions to component Managers and
stable full time project coordinator; b) component leader
with strong leadership skills; c) dedicated desk officer at
the sub-component level to address operational issues; d)
integration of proposed activities into strategic plans,
annual work plans, performance contracts and budgets of
MDAs; e) understanding how to harmonize government
and project procedures and systems; f) speed in
introducing agreed M&E framework; g) strong, elaborate
and
effective
communication
strategy
between
coordinating unit and stakeholders; h) regular higher level
management guidance; i) initial capacity building activities
on project design, procurement, disbursement, and

Annex 7: Poverty, Shared Prosperity and Progress toward MDGs
Poverty and shared prosperity
1.
At a time of major social and economic transitions, the conditions for attaining
better living standards are increasingly within reach for a majority of Kenyans. In the past
twenty years, Kenya’s economy has gone from one that was shrinking to an economy growing at
nearly 5 percent per year; jobs, once primarily in farming, are now predominantly in non-farm
self-employment and wage work; families are smaller and more likely to settle in towns and
cities; and people have more education and skills than ever before. Behind each of these
transitions are each individual Kenyan’s quest for opportunity and a desire for a better life for
themselves and their children. Despite these major social shifts, we know little about how
poverty has changed. Efforts to measure poverty and welfare in Kenya have been sporadic and
inconsistent. In the 30 years spanning 1980 to 2010, Kenya conducted four surveys that provided
a basis to measure poverty—an average of one survey every 8 years.
2.
The latest poverty measures are almost a decade old. The 2005/06 Kenya Integrated
Household Budget Survey (KIHBS) was the last nationally representative survey conducted by
the Government of Kenya to measure poverty. In the absence of more frequent surveys, there has
been a missed opportunity to understand whether the economic gains that have been achieved in
the past decade, have widely generated opportunities for Kenyans as a whole and in particular,
pathways out of poverty for the poor. Survey data from 2005/06 indicates that the scale of
consumption poverty in Kenya is staggering, and is concentrated in rural areas. Based on
Kenya’s national poverty line, close to half of the population (close to 17 million Kenyans) was
poor in 2005/06 and the vast majority of the poor lived in rural areas. Poor households are also
more likely to depend on income and consumption from crops and livestock, as a source of
livelihood. And poverty is strongly associated with low levels of education and large households.
Primary and secondary school completion rates are the lowest amongst the poorest individuals.
In 2009, the average size of households among the poorest 20 percent of households was 5.2
compared to a national average of 4.3 and an average of 3.5 among the wealthiest households.
3.
Poverty rates are highest in the arid and semiarid regions in the north and north
east, but Kenya’s poorest places are not the same places where most of the poor live. Areas
with very little annual rainfall, and thus, low agricultural potential have acute poverty. These
regions have also been historically neglected, reflecting Kenya’s unbalanced geographical
development. In 2005, poverty rates in arid regions (78 percent) were nearly double the poverty
rates in medium and high potential agricultural areas (with poverty rates averaging 41 percent).
Kenya’s lagging areas are sparsely populated and more isolated from its urban economic
engines—Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu. Kenya’s development—as elsewhere—has been
unbalanced geographically, and characterized by the growth of economic and population density
in towns and cities. The majority of Kenya’s poor live in the denser and higher potential
agricultural zones, in the vicinity of large urban centers. Due to patterns of population density,
the largest numbers of poor are concentrated in areas where land is most fertile. Medium to high
potential agricultural areas only make up 20 percent of all land, yet are home to 80 percent of the
population. As a result, the largest number of poor are found around the shores of Lake Victoria
in the west, the central highlands around Nairobi and east of Mt. Kenya and the coast near
Mombasa. With rapid and concentrated population growth in these areas, the pressure over
productive land resources will continue to grow.
90

4.
Between 1989 and 2009, Kenya has also experienced positive developments in
several non-income dimensions of poverty, but not all of them. On average, Kenyans are
increasingly healthy and more educated, enjoying better living conditions, and an expanded set
of consumption opportunities. At the same time, a large fraction of the population continues to
live with sub-standard access to water, sanitation and energy. Inequality of opportunity is quite
high. Indeed, for many, the sheer luck of where in the country one is born, one‘s ethnicity and
one’s family wealth play an outsize role in determining access to basic opportunities.
Poverty Estimates and Projections
5.
Kenya continues to grapple with high poverty rates despite a decade of sustained
moderate economic growth. The last national household budget survey to measure
consumption was undertaken in 2005/06, according to which 47 percent of Kenya’s population
(or 16.6 million people) lived in extreme poverty. By 2012/13, the poverty rate is estimated to
have declined to 39 percent if growth in consumption per capita of all households in all sectors
of the economy kept pace with observed growth in GDP per capita. Under a scenario whereby
inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient is simulated to increase by one percentage point
annually, the estimated poverty rate 2012/13 would only have fallen to 41 percent. Under this
scenario of worsening inequality, per capita consumption of the bottom 40 (the poor) in Kenya is
estimated to have grown by less than 3 percent compared to almost 14 percent for the top 60 (the
non-poor). It is pertinent for Kenya to undertake a new household budget survey in order to
better understand distributional dynamics and trends in poverty rates since 2005, both nationally
as well as subnationally and for different population groups.

6.
The poverty rate must be cut by 2 percentage points each year from now to 2030 if
extreme poverty is to be ended in that timeframe, and our simulations show that both the
pace and extent to which economic growth is inclusive will have a major influence on the
outlook. The prospects for eliminating poverty by 2030 in Kenya are beset by two formidable
challenges: the rate of economic growth would need to double and inequality, measured by the
Gini coefficient, would need to halve. If growth remains at historic levels of around 4 percent per
year and inequality remains unchanged, poverty rate will fall to 35 percent by 2018 and to 27
percent by 2030, as shown in Table 1 below. The progress in poverty reduction depends strongly
on what happens to inequality in the country. If inequality falls each year by one percentage
point, with a GDP growth rate of 4 percent, the poverty rate would fall to 28 percent by 2018 and
to 11 percent by 2030. Under this inequality reduction scenario, the goal of eliminating extreme
poverty is attainable if annual GDP growth rates increase to 6 percent. However, if inequality
91

increases each year by 1 percentage point, the poverty rate would remain at about 41 percent in
2018 and 2030.
Progress toward MDGs
1.
Kenya’s progress in meeting the MDGs has so far been mixed. Advances have been
made on a few MDGs, in particular on access to education, but on others, improvements have
been marginal at best. In areas such as health (tuberculosis prevalence), poverty, and
environment, indicators mark deterioration.
2.
The Millennium Development Goals Status Report for Kenya 2011 underscores that
the county governments will bear the greatest responsibility in the provision of key services
to citizens, most of which are essential for the attainment of the MDG targets. As the new
constitution provides for the transfer of 15 per cent of budgetary resources to the 47 Counties
that are the new levels of devolvement, the county governments will be expected to adequately
address MDGs through the formulation and implementation of their development plans and also
give priority to the off-targets MDGs in the respective counties,’ reads a section of the report.
3.
Kenya has already made considerable progress in the realisation of a number of
MDGs including the achievement of universal primary education (Goal 2), promoting gender
equality and empowering women (Goal 3), reducing child mortality (Goal 4), combating
HIV/AIDS, Malaria and other diseases (Goal 6) and ensuring environmental sustainability (Goal
7).
4.
However, the country’s performance in the eradication of extreme poverty and
hunger (Goal 1) remains dismal with more than 10 million people suffering from chronic
food insecurity and poor nutrition, while between one and two million people require
emergency food throughout the year (according to The Millennium Development Goals
Status Report for Kenya 2011). The report cites the number of challenges hampering Kenya’s
efforts toward eradicating extreme poverty and hunger including; poor crop production practices,
adverse climate changes, high food and fuel prices, population pressure, increasing frequency of
social conflicts and insecure land tenure systems, among others.
5.
Another area in which the country still registers poor performance, is MDG 5 on the
improvement of maternal health - despite the Government’s efforts in reducing maternal
mortality ratio. The number of lives lost in every 100,000 births previously stood at 414, the
figure subsequently increased to 488 as revealed by the report but have currently shot to 495
based on the latest statistics not captured in the report.
6.
Addressing maternal mortality requires concerted efforts of the government and
other stakeholders including development partners. The government directive to waive
maternity fees alongside other strategies such as more investments in the health sector would
have a decisive impact on Kenya’s efforts toward attainment of this goal.

Annex 8: Bank Group Collaboration
1.
Collaboration between the key arms of the World Bank Group—IFC, MIGA, and
the Bank (IDA)— increased over the most recent CPS period and included some pathbreaking examples, leading the way in Africa in bringing all three institutions together in
specific deals. Opportunities were grasped especially in activities to help in “unleashing Kenya’s
growth potential” (Pillar 1) and “reducing inequality and strengthening resilience”. The new CPS
(FY14-18) has been prepared as a fully joint product, and specific avenues are identified to
expand collaboration and make it even more effective in the coming year.
A.

Examples of World Bank Group collaboration during FY10-13

2.
Investment climate and corporate finance: IFC and the Bank jointly scoped, developed
and are now implementing the five-year Kenya Investment Climate Program 2 with funding
from DFID and the Dutch Government. IFC leads on regulatory reform (county and national),
competition policy, trade logistics, agribusiness and renewable energy while the Bank leads on
PPPs, special economic zones, innovation, exports and investment climate diagnostics.
3.
IFC and the Bank have also collaborated through the jointly implemented Efficient
Securities Market Institutional Development (ESMID) program. ESMID has supported a
number of initiatives including the preparation of bond transactions, bond market development in
relation to public-private partnership (PPP) projects, and improving corporate governance in the
Capital Markets Authority. There has been good coordination between ESMID and the Bank’s
Financial and Legal Sector Technical Assistance Project (FLSTAP); IFC has contributed to the
ICR for the latter.
4.
Other complementary activity in this area includes the Bank Group’s work to
support micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, and the annual Doing Business survey
which helped track the country’s overall progress in improving business regulation.
5.
Infrastructure: IFC and the Bank complemented each other effectively in the aviation
sector with the Bank strengthening institutional capacity in the airport and civil aviation sector
while IFC financed an upgrade of Kenya Airways’s fleet and network expansion plan. In
railways IFC financed rolling stock and infrastructure improvements associated with the KenyaUganda railway, and helped restructure the project, while the Bank managed the program to
resettle 70,000 displaced persons.
6.
Energy: IFC, WB and MIGA collaborated in the financing of two independent power
producers – Thika Power and Gulf Power, in which IFC provided financing to the two private
sector power generating companies, MIGA provided political risk insurance cover and IDA a
partial credit guarantee. IFC and WB have also co-financed the majority state owned energy
distribution company KPLC. IFC and the World Bank also jointly implemented Lighting Africa,
a regional program to mobilize the private sector to build sustainable markets that provide
affordable, modern off-grid lighting to communities in Africa, including in Kenya, that lack
electricity.
7.
Water and sanitation: the Bank’s Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) and IFC’s
Sustainable Business Advisory (SBA) and infrastructure department collaborated on a $30
million water utility financing facility. The WSP led on project identification and development
and support for legal/regulatory dialogue on commercial financing. IFC led on deal sourcing and
94

structuring and strengthening of utility financial management, asset management and IT systems.
Both the Bank and IFC provided advisory support to local banks to improve understanding of
water project financing.
8.
Agriculture: IFC participated in the Mid-Term Review mission of the Bank’s Kenya
Agricultural Productivity and Agribusiness Program (KAPAP) to review the Agribusiness
Component.
9.
Health: the Bank and IFC Our co-designed the Health in Africa project. A number of
activities have resulted including support to the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF). IFC
and WB are now jointly supporting a number of reforms including the development, design and
roll out of a health insurance subsidy program for the poor (HISP) by NHIF.
B.

Opportunities for further World Bank Group collaboration during FY14-18

10.
As shown by the examples above, collaboration between members of the World
Bank Group during FY10-FY13 was strong. Reflecting on this positive experience, a joint
IFC/World Bank workshop in July 2013 in Nairobi identified a number of principles that will
help shape collaboration going forward. These include the following: (a) joint working will be a
daily reality; (b) Group staff members will regularly ask ‘where can we each make a difference?
(c) Group collaboration will be based on an appreciation of the distinctive skills and differences
in the nature of risks faced by members; (d) effective joint working will improve with practice—
now that Bank Group staff members are co-located in a new building in Nairobi, advantage will
be taken of that proximity to ensure we know each other’s work with much greater familiarity.
11.
Taking into account the focus of the FY14-FY18 program there are a number of
clear potential opportunities to deepen and broaden Bank Group collaboration in Kenya
albeit subject to further careful confirmation that the right conditions for Bank Group
involvement are in place. These include, but are not limited to:
12.
Energy: IDA is well-placed to support the Government’s efforts to continue modernizing
and expanding selected transmission and distribution networks. There is also scope for IFC and
MIGA to continue helping to leverage private resources into independent power production
including geothermal and renewable energy. The oil and gas sector also offers potential for new
IDA involvement supporting the development of the regulatory and supervisory framework with
IFC and MIGA engagement to leverage private investment.
13.
Transport: Restoring Jomo Kenyatta International Airport to full functionality is an
immediate priority that will require continued public funding with scope for further IDA support.
In parallel, there are likely to be further opportunities to leverage private financing into
operational aspects of air transport and the provision of related services. Improving the
functionality of Mombasa port is a long term endeavor which in principle could also benefit from
a mix of IFC and IDA resources, if client ownership and the political economy are right.
14.
Water and sanitation (WS): There is still significant need to build institutional capacity
in the WS sector, particularly at county level. IDA’s global WS experts are well-placed to
support this work and enable IFC and MIGA, in due course, to engage at local levels and help
leverage private finance into this sector, including in coastal sectors.

95

15.
Agriculture: There is a pressing need to revisit the policy framework particularly with
respect to food crops including maize. Reforming the National Cereals and Produce Board
(NCPB), improving grain storage and establishing a commodity exchange are all areas where the
Bank Group could potentially help support Government efforts and encourage greater private
sector involvement.
16.
Other: Investment in improving access to finance, health and analytical work in the
education, governance and corporate governance sectors all offer further potential for Bank
Group collaboration.

96

Annex 9: Governance and Political Economy
A.

The Governance challenge and its context

1.
Kenya has been characterized by a number of governance challenges and
perceptions of poor governance seem to persist. Governance has been a major constraint to
unleashing Kenya’s full potential and weaknesses included inadequate legal provision and
mandate for Public Financial Management (PFM) ; weak oversight and control institutions (e.g.
audit, accounting and reporting, procurement) especially at subnational levels; weak and
untrusted judiciary and law enforcement; elite capture at both national and decentralized levels
of government and weak public participation, transparency and accountability in public matters.
These gave rise to a number of governance pathologies, including corruption, institutional
failures and exposure to fiduciary risks.
2.
Until recently, Kenya had been a highly centralized state with a strong executive
president and a weak legislature and judiciary. Oversight and checks on executive and
administrative powers and authority were thus weak. Politics center on ethnicity and with a
winner take all system, access to political power provides a source of patronage for wining elites.
Consequently, elections are fiercely contested and often violent. This dynamic reached its worst
state in the post 2007 election violence.
3.
Given its history, Kenya’s
governance performance has been
mixed. It does very well on the Bank’s
CPIA with one of the highest scores in the
Africa region (3.9 in 2012), though the
scores for the governance cluster are much
lower. As figure 1 (Annex) shows,
Kenya’s performance on the control of
corruption, political stability and absence
of violence and rule of law has been
relatively poor compared to other
countries, except for Nigeria. It does
relatively better on voice and transparency
and has one of the most vibrant media in
the region.

Figure 1: WGI: Kenya in Comparative
Perspective

4.
With the exception of 2013, since the introduction of multiparty elections in 1991,
growth rates in Kenya have historically dipped in election years, largely due to political
violence rooted in Kenya’s particular political economy, where patronage and ethnicity combine
to dominate electoral competition, thus undermining democracy as an exercise of voice and
development-oriented policy making.
B.

Changing Political Economy Landscape

5.
Kenya’s Vision 2030 emphasizes improving the rule of law, transparency and
accountability in the conduct of public affairs, security, peace and conflict management,
and public sector reforms, so as to strengthen Kenya’s foundation for development. Anticorruption initiatives will be intensified alongside improved investigation and prosecution. All
97

these have been binding governance constraints in Kenya and held back the country from
realizing its full potential.
6.
The 2010 constitution resets the rules of the power game in Kenya and offers
significant potentials for improved governance for development effectiveness. Since 2002
the governance landscape in Kenya has been changing positively, with the election of NARC
government and President Kibaki, though progress was punctuated by the post 2007 elections
violence. The 2010 constitution has been a significant game changer with the introduction of
new institutions and revamping of existing ones.
7.
Devolution is a major institutional change and the king pin of the 2010 constitution.
Kenya’s devolution is one of the most ambitious reforms and it aims to address old problems of
marginalization and inequality between regions which has fueled ethnic tensions in the past. The
constitution and the PFM Act 2012 also clarify roles and responsibilities and have strengthened
the authority of institutions for public financial management. For example, the Auditor General
confirms whether or not public money has been applied lawfully and in an effective way, while
the new office of the Controller of Budget authorizes withdrawals from public funds and
oversees implementation and reports to Parliament every four months.
8.
Checks and balances have been strengthened. However, the newly created
institutions are yet to be stabilized and embedded into a national framework. There is now
stronger legislative oversight and greater independence for the judiciary to check the executive
than before. The Judiciary is reforming and has been strengthened with a Supreme Court, a Chief
Justice and significant independence in appointments and financing. There are also constitutional
and legal requirements for improved citizens’ participation in public issues, including planning
and budgeting processes; independent commissions and offices including the Salary and
Remuneration Commission, the Commission for Revenue Allocation and the Controller of
Budget.
C.

Current Risks and Challenges

9.
Despite the new constitution and associated reforms there are significant risks and
challenges to improving governance. The 2010 constitution and devolution are still contested
governance processes with a section of stakeholders calling for referendum to amend the
constitution to give more resources to counties and more authority to the senate which represent
the interests of counties. Implementing devolution is fraught with risks, including fiscal and
service failures and capacity of counties to manage their devolved functions and resources,
which may possibly lead to attempt to claw back some functions and powers from devolved
units.
10.
Corruption and weak accountability with impunity remain challenges, despite the
constitution. Although there is progress in the reform of the judiciary, other justice sector
institutions such as the police and prosecution are lagging behind in reforms to complete the
circle of justice to citizens. Thus, there are institutional dynamics and uncertainties as well as
recalibrations of alliances and partnerships in the current political economy of Kenya. The
underlying risks of path dependency and reversal of reforms introduced by the 2010 constitution
is real and cannot be ignored in the efforts to improve development effectiveness in Kenya.

Conclusion

11.
Going forward, the CPS acknowledges that politics and institutions matter for
achieving development results in Kenya. Governance will frame the context for the design
and implementation of the CPS. The CPS will therefore support sectors in addressing governance
and political issues in priority sectors such as health, agriculture, education and infrastructure,
support the strengthening of institutions that matter most for critical functions and service
delivery and strengthening institutions and processes for participation and accountability.

Annex 10: Devolution: Challenges and Opportunities
A.
Main ways in which devolution can help end poverty and promote shared
prosperity through (a) driving growth; (b) reducing inequality; (c) improving institutions
and governance.
1.
Amidst many other reforms, devolution is arguably the most far-reaching reform under
Kenya’s 2010 Constitution. It is also one of the most ambitious devolutions underway in the
world, involving large-scale political, fiscal, and administrative decentralization. As per the
Constitution, Kenya’s devolution puts in place a whole new subnational layer of government,
including 47 counties each with an elected governor and assembly, responsible for a significant
portion of service delivery.
2.
Devolution seeks to address multiple objectives such as: tackle long-term, deeply
entrenched disparities between regions; increase the responsiveness of government to citizen
needs; allow greater degrees of autonomy to different regions and groups; strengthen governance
and accountability to citizens.
B.

Results, prospects, promises to date

3.
Since 2010, Kenya has successfully put in place the legal framework for devolution, and
a set of Constitutional bodies (the Transition Authority, the Commission on Revenue Allocation,
Constitutional Implementation Commission, Senate, etc.), largely in line with the Constitution.
4.
The 2013 elections, which proceeded peacefully without widespread violence or
disruptions to growth, kicked off the implementation period for devolution. The first six months
of devolution have been characterized by coordination challenges that have been exacerbated by
an even faster transition than was envisioned under the Constitution. Whereas the Constitution
envisaged that functions would be transferred gradually over a three-year period, most county
functions have already been transferred (along with approximately 30 percent of government
revenues, versus a Constitutional minimum of 15 percent, leaving some national government
functions potentially under-funded). Kenya has also adopted a highly progressive formula for
sharing these revenues across the 47 new counties, such that historically privileged counties
(which include the largest urban centers) are receiving much smaller resource transfers, on a per
capita basis, while historically marginalized areas (largely arid and semi-arid counties) receive
much larger per capita shares. Over time, this has the potential to address development
disparities.
C.

Opportunities, binding constraints, key challenges, highest priorities

5.
Devolution reforms seek to tackle long-term, deeply entrenched disparities and to
strengthen governance.
6.
Yet given the speed and scope of Kenya’s devolution, there are risks for service delivery
disruption, including in devolved functions in key sectors like urban management, water, health,
agriculture, and local roads.

But in the short- and medium-term, Kenya’s ambitious and rapid devolution poses
significant risks. These include:





D.

Major capacity challenges to get core county planning, PFM, and HR systems in place,
transfer staff, clarify county versus national functions, and build interfaces with citizens.
In particular, it will be important to put in place a basic data-driven performance
monitoring system, focused initially on core county systems (rather than on outputs or
outcomes), to identify key needs and inform capacity building efforts.
Addressing the unique risks of urban areas. Although they are the key drivers of growth,
large urban counties like Nairobi and Mombasa have inherited significant payroll and
debt obligations, at the same time as reduced central transfers. Smaller urban areas lack
dedicated urban management units, and there are risks that urban services will not be
adequately funded by county assemblies elected predominantly from rural areas.
Addressing the unique challenges of historically marginalized areas. Larger transfers to
counties in arid and semi-arid regions provide an opportunity to address long-standing
infrastructure and service delivery gaps. But these counties typically face major capacity
gaps and will require support to strengthen capacity to design and implement productive
investments.
Supporting the sectors that are being devolved to counties the fastest, including health,
agriculture, and local infrastructure service delivery. These sectors, and associated WBfinanced programs, face major transition challenges.
Operationalizing Constitutional provisions to improve transparency and citizen
participation in county planning, budgeting, and performance management systems.
How we can be selective – priorities

10.
Support county capacity to carry out core planning and public financial
management functions (building on ongoing support for county planning, PFM capacity, and
the continued roll-out of the integrated financial management information system (IFMIS).
11.
Support the design, testing and roll-out of a performance assessment tool/system for
county governments. A basic data-driven performance monitoring system, focused initially on
core county systems, will be needed to identify key needs and inform capacity building efforts.
12.
Analyze fiscal impacts of devolution with particular attention to vertical and horizontal
imbalances. However, although significant risks are emerging, little systematic analysis has
been done to understand the fiscal impacts of vertical and horizontal revenue sharing.
13.
Address the different risks faced by urban and marginalized rural areas. Not
surprisingly, revenue sharing under Kenya’s rapid devolution has created significant imbalances.
101

On one hand, although they are the key drivers of growth, large urban counties like Nairobi and
Mombasa have inherited significant payroll and debt obligations, at the same time they face
reduced central government transfers. By contrast, counties in arid and semi-arid regions have
new resources that provide opportunity to address long-standing infrastructure and service
delivery disparities. But these counties typically face major capacity gaps.
14.
Support roll-out of basic transparency and citizen participation mechanisms in
county planning, budgeting, and performance management, as per the Constitution and legal
framework and drawing on growing global experience linking social accountability with
enhanced development outcomes.

Annex 11: Statistics for Results
A.

Overview

1.
Kenya has seen significant improvement in data collection, compilation and analysis
of statistical information since the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) was created in
2006 as a semi-autonomous government agency. Yet there are significant gaps, most notably in
poverty data which remain woefully out of date given the vintage of the last household survey.
The Bank-supported project to build statistical capacity helped somewhat, but was not
satisfactory, and we need greater Government commitment to help push a new engagement
which we could offer.
2.
Integrated Household Budget Survey (IHBS): The last integrated household survey
was undertaken in 2005/06. Although such IHBS were targeted for every 5 years, KNBS has
been unable to undertake further surveys due to lack of adequate funding. As a result, we do not
know precisely how recent economic gains and government policy have generated pathways out
of poverty. The last survey indicated a poverty rate of 46 percent (2006). Without updated survey
numbers, it has been hard for policy makers and development partners to update poverty
estimates, and inform poverty reduction strategies—our best estimate is that poverty now stands
around 38 percent.
3.
Core statistics: The overall quality, timeliness and coverage of macroeconomic statistics
(national accounts and CPI) have improved over the last CPS period. CPI data is published at the
end of each month while national accounts are produced quarterly. The KNBS also produces,
monthly, the leading economic indicators of high frequency data (trade and monetary statistics)
in hard copies and through their website. Fiscal data is produced quarterly by the National
Treasury through the ministry’s Quarterly Economic and Budget Reviews and uploaded on
website. KNBS is in the process of rebasing its GDP figure (replacing the present price and
quantity structure of the base year used to compile real measures of GDP with a new or more
recent price structure). The last time this was done was in 2003/04. Despite improvements in
overall quality and timeliness in some macro statistics further improvements in the methodology
in compiling real, fiscal and external sectors is needed. For example, there are concerns that FDI
data are under-reported.
4.
Data Access: Even though KNBS has an open data policy, it has proved very hard in
practice for researchers and development partners (including the World Bank) to get data (such
as simple census information) from them. The open policy needs to be properly put into
practice.
B.

Sectoral and Institutional Context

5.
Statistics is a crucial element for informed, evidence-based decision making, and
monitoring of progress and implementation of government’s medium term plans. The
Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) is the coordinator of the National Statistics System
(NSS) and is responsible for producing a wide range of key social and economic statistics,
including demographics, poverty, labor, price, trade, production, and national accounts data.
Kenya has a well-established system for collection of regular production of social and economic
data and has embraced the Open Data Initiative, which opens up new ways to generate and
disseminate statistics in a more efficient and timely manner. The Kenya National Bureau of
103

Statistics (KNBS) is the main institution responsible for collecting and disseminating official
statistics. The transformation of the KNBS from a Department in the Ministry of Planning to an
independent national statistics office governed by a Board of Directors was supported by a
World Bank STATCAP Project (P085414) and financed by a 5-year IDA-credit. The support
from the World Bank and other partners enabled KNBS to make several improvements including
the enactment of a new statistics law that facilitated greater and better coordination of the
national statistics system, human resource development, upgrade of physical and statistical
infrastructure, and the development of new and better data products.
6.
Statistical capacity and constraints. Despite the progress made in recent years, Kenya’s
statistical system faces several challenges. Collecting data in Kenya is a time, labor and resource
intensive endeavor, particularly in the semi-arid areas where populations are scarcely distributed.
Given the modest allocation for statistics in the national budget, much of the institutional budget
is allocated for salaries, wages and field operations, leaving little discretionary resources for
innovation, reform and capacity development. As a consequence, KNBS has not produced
regular data that could be used by policy makers to monitor trends in the labor market and
household living conditions and poverty. A Labor Force Survey was last undertaken in the 1990s
and the last Household Budget Survey was completed in 2005/6. Data dissemination has also
been below user expectations. The three national databases are neither comprehensive nor
updated regularly. The upload of data in KenInfo is not systematic so while some indicators are
up-to-date, many are several years out of date. Second, important datasets, such as detailed
information relating to the 2009 Population and Housing Census, have not yet been uploaded on
KNBS’ website despite being publicly launched in 2010. Although the National Data Archive
(NADA) is designed as a database for micro data, no data sets are currently available online.
Lastly, publications, such as the Economic Survey or the Statistical Abstract, are not available
online, and out of the thirteen STATCAP funded surveys, only three are available online for
public use. Improving the online availability of its products is a major challenge for KNBS in
order to regain the confidence of its users as the main provider of statistics, which is a public
good.
7.
There is a growing demand in government for statistics for use in planning and
budgeting, targeting of policies and programs, as well as outcome monitoring and
evaluation. Relevant and accurate statistics, that are made available in a timely manner to policy
makers and the general public alike, are essential ingredients for formulating informed policies
and for monitoring and evaluating their development impacts. The Government’s second
Medium Term Plan 2013-2017 articulates its development strategy whose objectives includes
implementing devolution, accelerating growth, reducing poverty, transforming the structure of
the economy and creating more quality jobs as the country prepares to achieve middle income
status by 2030. Underpinned in this strategy is the government commitment to strengthen the
national statistical system to support planning, monitoring and evaluation of government policies
and programmes. The momentum for major reform in KNBS is now stronger than ever, based on
external demands both within the government and from the public. For example, in the second
MTP, the government directed that five major surveys and censuses be carried out within four
years to improve the quality of data. This includes: Kenya Integrated Household Budget Survey
(KIHBS) II; census of agriculture; labour force survey; census of business establishments; and
generation of county statistical profiles.

104

8.
With the creation of 47 counties under the new constitution, in which statistics is a
shared function, KNBS will have to restructure to build and increase its ability to compile
county and sector statistics to meet the demand for relevant, accurate, timely, and
disaggregated data. The KNBS has mainly been a centralized agency without substantive
presence in all districts. However, when county governments as administrative units came into
effect in March 2013, the system has become highly decentralized, which has created a high
demand for more geographically disaggregated data. With the new constitution there is pressure
for the establishment of statistics offices in all the 47 counties, which will supervise and
coordinate statistical programmes at the county level and ensure that international standards are
applied in the production and dissemination of county statistics, and that there will be harmony
between national data and aggregated county data.
C.

Relationship to CPS

9.
Support to Statistics will contribute to the Kenya Country Partnership Strategy and
the governments Medium-Term Priorities (PRSP) to support evidence-based decisionmaking through, amongst other initiatives, strengthened national statistics. Kenya has
already benefitted from the World Bank STACAP project, which was rated moderately
unsatisfactory as a result of unresolved financial management and procurement issues as well as
lack of progress in data dissemination. Support to strengthening the national statistical system is
consistent with the results based focus and is consistent with IDA’s leadership role in the global
partnership for statistical capacity building. In addition, as part of IDA 15 and IDA 16 Results
Measurement System, results based Country Assistance or Partnership Strategies are expected to
include a review of the national statistical systems and an indication of what is needed to
strengthen the capacity both to generate and to use statistical data. The program will contribute
to this agenda by improving the quantity and quality of statistics and ensuring that they are
analyzed and disseminated widely.
10.
Support to Statistics is also consistent with Africa’s region and the Bank Group’s
twin goals of eradicating extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity, as well as
growing interest by foreign investors in the quality of national accounts. The goal of the
Africa Region’s effort is to help these countries generate more and better-quality data; develop a
model for collaborating with the Fund, which has the lead role on National Accounts; and, more
broadly, build capacity to promote greater use of statistics.
D.

Lessons learnt and Client perspectives

11.
The STATCAP ICR recommended continued Bank support to statistics in Kenya.
Our AAA/NLTA includes working with KNBS counterparts in areas of poverty maps and
consumer price index. On investments, the Bank supported STATCAP project helped
institutional reform but overall did not achieve its other developmental objectives and was rated
unsatisfactory. Lessons have been learnt on both sides. The KNBS leadership has indicated to
bank staff of a need for both non leading technical assistance and any other instrument to enable
them build its capacity and improve collection, compilation and analysis of statistical
information, publication and dissemination of statistical information for public use and
coordinating, monitoring and supervising the national statistical system. A World Bank team has
met KNBS management team in September 2013 to discuss potential areas for collaboration in
the short to medium run. The KNBS management team requested a combination of technical and
financial support and this is something to be considered within the CPS deliberations.

Annex 12: Gender
A.

Position of Women in Kenya

1.
Gender equality and women’s empowerment are development goals with intrinsic
value. They are also central to economic development and the current development context
in Kenya – devolution, the constitution, and other policy reforms - offer compelling
opportunities to advance these values. However, if Kenya wants to achieve 10% economic
growth rate per annum as stipulated in the Vision 2030, it has to continue to increase economic
opportunities for women.
1.

Health

2.
Maternal mortality in Kenya has remained unacceptably high at 488 maternal
deaths (per 100,000 live births) in 2008/9, an increase from 414 in 2003. The situation is not
helped by stagnating maternal care indicators: over the last ten years the proportion of deliveries
performed by skilled attendants has remained at around 44 percent. Skilled birth attendance is
vital to protecting the health of newborns as the majority of perinatal deaths occur during labor
and delivery or within the first 48 hours after delivery (UNFPA, 2007).
3.
Violence against women and girls remains endemic across the country and is
supported by the cultural context. Almost half (45%) of women aged 15-49 years report
experiencing either physical or sexual violence1. According to the first ever national-level study
on violence against children published by PUNOs in 2012, 31.9% of females and 17.5% of males
experience at least one incident of sexual violence before the age of 182. The socio-cultural
environment in Kenya is conducive to gender-based violence, with 5 out of 10 women and 6 out
of 10 men aged 18-24 years believing that it is acceptable for a husband to beat his wife. Despite
a recent increase in reporting, data suggest that 45% of women who have experienced GBV did
not seek help or tell anyone.3
4.
Partly thanks to sustained public awareness campaigns, Kenya has witnessed
impressive progress in the decline in incidents of Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting
(FGM/C). However, there are striking regional differences - in North Eastern province, nearly
all women aged 15-49 years have experienced FGM/C, while in Western province, only 0.8% of
women have undergone the practice.4
5.
One out of every eight adults in rural Kenya and almost one out of every five adults
in urban areas are infected with HIV, with women being particularly vulnerable. The
infection rate in girls and young women is exponentially higher than in their male counterparts.
Women’s greater vulnerability is connected to their lower social status. For example, there is a
ritual cleansing practice which requires widows to have sex with a man of low social standing to
"cleanse" them of their dead husband's "evil spirits."

6.
Primary education has recorded remarkable gains in enrolment since the
implementation of free primary education: gender parity has almost been achieved,
although there are still sharp regional and income disparities. The ratio of female to male
primary enrollment is estimated at around 98 percent. However, girls in arid and semi-arid
regions have significantly lower enrollment rates, while primary-age girls from the poorest 60
per cent of households are three times more likely to be out of school as those from the
wealthiest households (the same disparities apply even more at secondary level).
7.
While the ratio of female to male enrollment is lower at the secondary level (90
percent), it is still better than in many other countries in the region and there have been
continued efforts from the government to improve the situation. The government has
continued with the implementation of the free secondary tuition which started in 2008, and has
provided infrastructural support through the Quick Wins Initiative, which has given desks and
sanitation facilities to selected schools. This has led to a rise in the primary to secondary school
transition rate from 64.1 per cent in 2008 to 66.9 per cent in 2012. The relatively larger gender
gap in enrollment at the secondary level is due to numerous reasons, including early marriages,
pregnancy, the lower social status of girls, and girls’ greater domestic responsibilities5.
8.
Partly due to their weaker progress to secondary level education, more women are
not able to gain a university education and thus rely more heavily on technical and
vocational education. The female share enrolment in public Technical, Industrial, Vocational
and Entrepreneurship Training is around 49%, while data for 2009/10 suggests that the same
figure for university enrollments is only 37.9 percent.
3.

Governance

9.
Even though women account for 51% of the Kenyan population, they remain
underrepresented in key governance positions. In 2012, women accounted for just15% of the
key leadership positions in the public sector and less than 10% of parliamentarians (compared to
the sub-Saharan average of 20.4%)6. Only 38% of the Kenyan population agrees that they can
vote for a female president, reflecting the cultural bias against women’s suitability for public
office. Additionally, there is still disagreement about the implementation of the ‘not more than
two-thirds’ gender principle outlined in the constitution: the Supreme Court has declared that the
Constitution called for its progressive realization in enforcing the rule but not immediate
implementation in the upcoming 2013 General Elections. It is expected that women’s numerical
representation at the county level will meet the not more than two-thirds principle through
nomination to meet any gaps following the election for county assembly seats. By 2012, most
political parties also met the gender requirement of not more than two-thirds principle.
4.

Economic empowerment

10.
Kenyan women are making a significant yet often ignored contribution to the
country’s economy. While women perform the vast majority of household chores such as
cooking, collecting firewood, fetching water and caring for family members, these are not
included in the country’s National Accounts and so are less visible in the policy-making context.

11.
While women are well represented as entrepreneurs, they are more concentrated
amongst the smallest businesses and have less access to finance. According to a 2010 IFC
study, women–owned businesses account for 48% of MSMEs, contributing 20% to Kenya’s
GDP7. Despite women’s extensive representation in the SME sector, they access less than 10%
of available credit and less than 1% of agricultural credit. Women’s lower access to land (which
is often required as collateral) and the tendency for banks to require the permission of husbands
in order to grant credit to married women are some of the factors impeding women’s access to
finance. Furthermore, as access to finance for women entrepreneurs is guaranteed mainly
through microfinance, there is a ”missing middle” as the women who wish to grow their
businesses beyond the micro-level have only limited options. In addition to problems accessing
finance, the locating of the business registration process in Nairobi presents a challenge to timepoor women, who are less able to travel long distances. The decentralization reform process
therefore has great potential for supporting women’s entrepreneurship.
12.
Gender gaps in the agriculture sector are particularly significant as this sector
provides support to the poorest people. Kenyan women are the major force in agriculture and
provide over 70% of the labor force – yet they own only a fraction of land titles8. Research
suggests that weaker land rights reduce incentives to invest in land and may contribute to lower
productivity. Women are also disadvantaged in their access to various other agricultural inputs
and a recent World Bank survey revealed that a significantly larger proportion of male (54
percent) than female (41 percent) primary farmers had received extension services over the
previous year9, with the African Development Bank estimating that women only 7 percent of
agricultural extension information10. The consequences of these gender disparities are serious,
with some research suggesting that allocating land, labor, capital, and fertilizer more equally
would increase agricultural yields in Kenya by more than 20 percent11.
13.
While the female to male labor force participation ratio is not too low (86 percent),
women are less likely to work in formal sector wage jobs. Only 29 percent of those earning a
formal wage are women, leaving a huge percentage of women to work in the informal sector
without any government support. Women’s vulnerability in terms of employment is also
highlighted by the fact that 79 percent of women aged 30-64 are estimated to work as own
account or unpaid family workers, compared to 54 percent of men12 - the effect is severe as
nearly 40 percent of households are run solely by women. Female youth appear to perform
particularly poorly in the labor market: unlike in many African countries, young women have a
higher unemployment rate than young men, and the ratio of female youth to adult unemployment
is 2.1813. However, there are some positive trends: women appear to have been successfully
shifting from agricultural employment. The 2008-9 DHS suggests that the proportion of women
doing professional, technical, and managerial jobs has been growing and is higher than the
proportion of men (31 percent versus 20 percent)14.

B.

The Institutional Climate for Gender

1.

The overall policy and legal context

14.
The Government of Kenya (GoK) has institutionalized gender mainstreaming as a
key strategy for achieving equitable national development. The Ministry of Gender, Children
and Social Development is mandated to facilitate the process of mainstreaming gender by
building the capacities of all government ministries and State Corporations. In the process of
mainstreaming gender within the government structure, the GoK has encountered some key
challenges such as inadequate financing for gender activities, a lack of gender- sensitive
budgeting processes, and inadequate staff capacity.
15.
The government has also lent its support to gender issues through various policies
and initiatives. In 2012, the GoK finalized and validated the National Affirmative Action Policy
to guide the implementation of the gender equality principles as enshrined in the Constitution.
Other significant policies include: the abolition of user fees in all public maternity hospitals and
clinics; Article 7 (2) of the Political Parties Act (2011), which stipulates that not more than twothirds of a political party’s governing body can be of the same gender; the Children’s Act 2001
and government declaration in 2003 that ushered in free primary education; and the development
of a National Gender-Based Violence Policy (though enforcement of the laws relating to GBV
remains an issue). Some significant initiatives from the government include: the Youth
Enterprise Fund, established in 2006, which aims to tackle youth unemployment, with a focus on
gender; and the Women Enterprise Fund (WEF), which was set up by the GoK in 2007 to
provide accessible and affordable credit to support women to start or expand businesses.
2.

The Constitution

16.
The adoption of a new Constitution by Kenya in 2010 was a major step forward on
women’s rights. Women and men now formally have the right to equal treatment and
opportunities in political, economic, cultural and social spheres without discrimination.
17.
The Constitution provides that not more than two-thirds of the members of elective
public bodies shall be of the same sex (including at the county level), and calls on political
parties to respect gender equity. The fact that the two-thirds rule applies to the county level is
particularly relevant in the current context of decentralization. As a result of advocacy and
sensitization campaigns related to the two-thirds rule, there has been an increase in the
participation of women as voters and candidates. More women have been elected or nominated
into the National Assembly, Senate and County Assemblies.
18.
The constitution also provides for numerous other rights for women, including those
related to citizenship, marriage/divorce, land, and public service opportunities. However,
there is still much progress to be made in ensuring that women are able to realize these
rights in practice. Kenyan women are now able to pass on citizenship to their children
regardless of whether or not they are married to Kenyans. Both parties to a marriage are now
entitled to equal rights at the time of marriage, during the marriage and at the dissolution of the
marriage. Parental responsibility for children—as it is laid out in the constitution--is now shared
between both parents regardless of marital status. The constitution also prohibits sex
discrimination in law, customs and practices related to land and property in land, and provides
109

for the protection of matrimonial property with special interest on the matrimonial home during
and upon the termination of marriage. Finally, the constitution provides for equal opportunities
for the appointment, training and advancement for men and women at all levels of public service.

What the World Bank is Doing on Gender

19.
The World Bank is committed to increasing the focus on gender issues in its work
and is measuring this through gender-related indicators and targets in IDA16, for which
gender equality is a Special Theme. This includes a target of 60 percent of country portfolio
activities to be gender-informed, and a target of 100 percent of CPSs to draw on the findings of a
gender assessment (a requirement already established in OP4.20). Integrating gender into the
CPS, particularly into the Results Framework, will allow the Bank to: (1) ensure clarity of
purpose in the overall gender-related objectives of the country portfolio; (2) ensure alignment
with the priorities of the Government of Kenya; (3) highlight progress; and (4) ensure effective
accountability of the CMU for achieving such progress.
20.
In order to assist with the effective integration of gender into the CPS, a gender
portfolio review was undertaken by the CMU, with support from the Africa Region Gender
Practice. This review provides an assessment of the coverage of gender work in the current
portfolio, with a focus on the integration of gender in project analysis, actions, and M&E, as
outlined in project preparation documents.
21.
The main focus of the gender portfolio review is the portfolio of 25 active and
pipeline IDA projects – the review finds that 19 out of these 25 projects (76 percent) are
gender-informed. The current portfolio is supporting a wide range of gender-related outcomes,
including: women’s decision-making capacity at community and project levels; women’s access
to financial resources; rural women’s income generation and agricultural productivity; female
youth employment opportunities; women’s access to land and sustainable land management
capacity; access to basic infrastructure of importance to key gender issues (water, sanitation,
health); women’s vulnerability to HIV/AIDS; maternal health; and women’s access to justice.
22.
The World Bank’s Kenya portfolio includes some gender-informed work that
provides good opportunities for leveraging the current development and political context of
the country. The focus on female youth in the Youth Empowerment Project could enable the
country to leverage the skills of women and take advantage of the demographic dividend, with
over 40 percent of Kenya’s population estimated to be under 15 years of age. The Bank’s
portfolio also presents opportunities for ensuring that the current process of devolution is gender
informed: several projects include measures to involve women in project and community level
decision-making, and the Accountable Devolution project will allow the team to track changes in
men’s and women’s perceptions of governance, as the devolution process unfolds.
23.
The Bank’s coverage of gender in ESW work is low, with some missed opportunities
that should be addressed in the body of work being planned for the coming period. The
team should ensure that it generates sufficient gender knowledge to prioritize the most suitable
investments in gender given the situation on the ground—and to find ways to mainstream gender
in the most suitable way in pipeline interventions. There are some good examples of genderinformed knowledge work being undertaken through other products: the Youth Empowerment
Project plans to conduct a gender-sensitive impact evaluation, which will provide valuable
110

knowledge on the effectiveness of interventions to improve young women’s entry into the labor
market; and the Gender Policy Note, ‘Tapping the Potential of Farming in Kenya’ (2013),
contributes to the knowledge base on gender differences in agriculture and access to inputs. In
addition, there are some good examples of knowledge being generated within projects. For
example, the Kenya Agricultural Productivity and Agribusiness Project will contribute to a
sector gender policy, and the Petroleum Technical Assistance Project (P145234) plans a sector
gender analysis, which would be highly appropriate given the burgeoning oil sector.
24.
The team may want to consider producing a new Kenya Country Gender
Assessment or to include gender as part of a joint Poverty and Gender Assessment. The
current CPS is informed by numerous gender diagnostics and an extensive assessment of recent
literature and statistics on gender that was carried out as an additional component of the gender
portfolio review. However, the most recent examples of country gender diagnostics are fairly old
and predate the new constitution: e.g. from 2003 (World Bank Country Gender Assessment),
2007 (AfDB Country Gender Profile), and 2008 (World Bank Poverty and Inequality
Assessment)15. For the team to ensure compliance with OP 4.20, the CPS needs to integrate the
findings of one of the existing gender diagnostics into the CPS—it can be produced by the Bank
or another agency, as long as it is explicitly referenced as feeding into the CPS. If an assessment
cannot be undertaken by the Bank or another institution within this CPS preparation period, this
should be mentioned in the CPS along with a timeline for when a gender assessment will be
undertaken. Senior Management is now reviewing all CPSs, preventing any from going to the
Board of Executive Directors unless it is in compliance with OP4.20. Finally, the team could use
impact evaluations to generate knowledge on the effectiveness of specific interventions, allowing
the team to adjust its approach to certain gender issues as it moves forward. In this regard, the
team may want to consult with the Gender Innovation Lab of the Africa Region Gender Practice,
which specializes in designing rigorous impact evaluations focused on key gender policy
questions.
25.
There are a few sectors in which the team may consider expanding their focus, with
particular attention to gender. Despite continuing gender gaps, the team does not have any
operations in the education sector. However, increasing the attention to gender in the integrated
education database EFO could serve as a good analytical starting point to inform any future
gender-informed re-engagement in the education sector. Given the increasing importance of the
oil industry to the Kenyan economy, the team could also consider using the sector gender
analysis planned for the Petroleum Technical Assistance Project as an opportunity to develop a
gender-informed oil operation. Given the relative competitiveness of Kenya’s ICT sector, the
country team could also consider increasing attention to gender in the KTCIP. Not only could the
sector contribute to female employment, but internet connectivity and e-government applications
could have particular implications for women, given their generally lower geographical mobility
(due to personal safety, culture, access to private transport) and greater time-poverty (due to
unequal domestic responsibilities). In the context of the new constitution, the team could carry
out analytical work to examine the obstacles preventing women from realizing their rights in
practice.
D.

Moving Forward: A Strategy for the World Bank

15

Since reviewing the recommendations of the gender portfolio review, the team has decided to undertake a Joint Poverty and
Gender Assessment in FY14, which will provide more up-to-date analytical underpinnings for upcoming gender activities.

111

26.
With the exception of the lack of a recent country gender assessment and the low
levels of gender-informed ESW, the country portfolio is looking strong on gender, with
projects having met and exceeded the gender targets related to IDA16 (e.g. 60% or projects
rated gender-informed and 100 percent of the CPSs). This CPS process is a good opportunity
to put the program ahead of the curve on coming gender commitments associated with the
IDA17 replenishment.
27.
Gender will be made a special theme again for IDA17 when replenishment
negotiations conclude in December 2013, leading to additional targets and monitoring on
gender in the IDA portfolio. In particular, while design-stage integration of gender in the
portfolio is now good in most IDA countries, we are performing poorly in follow-up: supervision
reports and completion reports more often than not fail to report on any gender-relevant
outcomes. While the precise targets are yet to be finalized, Senior Management has stressed the
importance of moving beyond a focus on gender analysis and project design, to establish and
pursue ambitious and time-bound targets, effectively tracking results and outcomes. There will
also be a stronger emphasis on gender in supervision and completion. IDA CPSs are likely to be
required to be gender-informed in all three of the dimensions tracked: drawing on previous
analysis (a country gender assessment), in the proposed actions (in the results matrix), and in the
monitoring indicators and evaluation efforts.
Box 1. IFC’s support to mainstreaming gender issues
The IFC portfolio includes the following gender-focused activities:
 An agribusiness and value chain diagnostic and gender tool kit will be used to mainstream gender in all
IFC agribusiness activities aimed at improving the productivity of smallholder tea producers.
 The SME Banking Advisory program incorporates a gender component that aims to improve financial
services provided to women by training bank staff and female customers and supporting the
development of specific products aimed at women.
 Numerous gender-relevant activities in the health sector:
 The Health in Africa Initiative (HiA) recently completed a gender assessment of the private health
sector in 6 countries to document the disparities that prevent the equitable participation of men, women
and youth in the sector. HiA has also supported the development of the health bill, which seeks to
ensure a level playing field for men and women health practitioners.
 Under the African Health Markets for Equity program, the IFC is seeking to reform National Hospital
Insurance Fund regulation that does not allow nurse-owned/run clinics to be part of its accredited
facilities (the majority of nurses in Kenya are female).
 The IFC is currently rolling out a health insurance subsidy program targeting the poorest people who
cannot afford to pay insurance premiums.
 The Lighting Africa program includes a focus on inclusive business models that will integrate
women’s groups into the supply chain of off-grid lighting products in the rural market. The program is
also engaging these groups to adopt modern off-grid technologies that will help women to undertake
more income generating activities that are today restricted to the day time.
 Activities supporting clean cooking (planed for Q3 &4 FY14) will provide women with
entrepreneurship training, consumer education, and the integration of women into supply chains.

Annex 13: Client and Stakeholder Views
1.
In formulating the FY14-FY18 CPS, the Bank Group has drawn from relevant
sources. Extensive consultations involved stakeholders in government, the private sector,
development partners, NGOs, women’s groups, the Association of County Governors, and 24
out of 47 new counties in Kenya. Key insights are summarized in the boxes below.
2.
A wider group of the Bank’s stakeholders were also invited to provide their feedback
and insights through the latest client survey undertaken in 2012. Their responses raised a
number of important questions and issues. These include the following issues and challenges
(together with page references from the Client Survey) for the country team:
3.
WBG efficiency: According to stakeholders, the Bank’s greatest value lies in its financial
resources. 53% of all respondents took this position in the 2012 survey (and 61% in the 2005
survey). Yet stakeholders rate its ability to disburse promptly very low. Given the fundamental
importance of the Bank’s financial resources to its clients, and the relatively low level of
satisfaction among respondents with respect to speed of disbursement, the challenge for the Bank is
to continue to search for ways of increasing the efficiency of disbursement.
4.
Sectors: Agriculture, education, and job creation are the top three sectors for poverty
reduction and growth according to stakeholders; yet in some respects, for reasons discussed above
in this CPSCR (see Annex 2), the Bank has struggled to have an impact in these sectors during
FY10-13. In agriculture, the challenges lie particularly in the overall policy and regulatory
framework, transport, access, and storage. In education, the Bank’s experience has been traumatic
with the suspension of its flagship education project as a result of financial irregularities. Job
creation was also a theme that was emphasized in the July 2013 Nairobi CPS workshop by external
speakers. Nearly 80% of Kenya’s population is 35 years old or less while young people aged
between 18 and 34 comprise a third of the population. Population growth has outpaced economic
growth and the unemployment rate among young people is 12.7% or twice the national average.
Yet this is the sector where stakeholders rate the Bank second lowest.
5.
Cross-cutting issues: External speakers at the July CPS workshop in Nairobi emphasized
the importance of addressing the position of women. Respondents were asked the question ‘which
three areas of development would contribute most to reducing poverty in Kenya’? Just 2% of
respondents cited gender, 3% environmental sustainability and 4% natural resource management.
6.
Financial resources: According to stakeholders the Bank should be playing a very
significant role in Kenya’s development by providing financial resources, or the Bank’s most
important asset.
7.
Stimulating debate: The technical quality of the Bank’s knowledge products is very high
according to stakeholders. However, the Bank’s role in stimulating public debate and dialogue,
according to the same stakeholders, is very low.
8.
Outreach: 70% of respondents receive most of their information on economic and social
development from local newspapers. This has raised questions about whether the Bank’s presence
in the papers should be increased. The Bank’s public information services are rated very highly by
those that use them, but more should be done to build on this.

Annex 15: Dynamic selectivity at the strategic and programmatic levels
Our CPS is selective since it is critical we deploy the Bank Group’s limited resources in the most
effective way possible. How is this selectivity conveyed and implemented? It will be done at two
levels.
At the primary level, our domains of engagement quite deliberately focus on some clusters of
activity while downplaying or excluding others. Let us illustrate by taking the first domain—
competitiveness and sustainability. Given that the diagnostic review has identified that key
infrastructure gaps—notably in power, water, and transport—are constraining growth, then these
themes are clearly candidates for continuing engagement. Yet even here we will exercise
selectivity in resource use as between the arms of the Bank Group. As a guide, when IFC and
MIGA can be arranged to leverage private sector finance (e.g. in power) then IDA resources will
be used to a lesser extent, and conversely where the conditions are currently less conducive to
private finance (e.g. in the water sector) relatively more IDA resources will be allocated when
economically justified.
Our analysis also shows that some sub-sectors of the economy are more likely than others to
drive rapid growth. For example low-level manufacturing and other domestically focused
industries are not priorities in the CPS. In contrast IFC aims to continue and perhaps expand its
investments in agribusiness and the financial sector (both of which are regionally significant and
improve Kenya’s trade position); and both the Bank and IFC expect to provide some support to
the nascent oil and gas industry which has immense prospects to support medium term growth.
We are also not prioritizing tourism for our investment—since private capital has a long and
relatively successful track record here.
This all makes sense but some may ask why are the domains of engagement broad? Are they
sharp enough to instil true selectivity? One has to recognize that given Kenya’s stage of
development—where the needs are huge and there are a great many binding constraints, many or
indeed most of which cannot be systematically ranked—it is not sensible to pretend we know
only three or so actions are needed to deliver on the fight against poverty. Further, while the
Bank Group resources are limited, we should not box ourselves in so tightly that we then fail to
capitalize on the depth of expertise we have through our different tools—for example IFC
finance where IDA is not a priority; analytical work where money is not the problem; making
connections with other partners (including South-South). Hence it is appropriate to have the
domains of engagement we have selected, while recognizing that they provide only one stage of
selectivity.

Hence at the next level, to be more incisive in our choices and to do that in an adaptable way
over time (what some have termed “dynamic selectivity”), our new approach we will forge any
new activity—especially investment operations—against a four-pronged benchmark, to ensure it
is genuinely where we should deploy our scare resources and where there are reasonable
prospects of success.
This is not a mechanistic exercise and will call for professional judgment but the process can be
made disciplined with a simple checklist that teams can utilize as project concept and preparation
is undertaken. The template is being developed and is shaped as follows. The “4C” test is
specifically:

Confirming a credible line of sight
Does the investment directly target the poor (which in Kenya’s case cover the bottom 40
percent) and can this be measured?
If not, is there a plausible causal chain, even if long term, and what sensible intermediate
indicators can be deployed?
Is there evidence to show the expected economic benefit is acceptable, and ideally higher
than other comparable interventions?
Will this activity directly create jobs (especially relevant for some IFC deals) and/or help
poor beneficiaries including women (for whom the alleviation of specific constraints
would be identified)?
Critically reviewing our capability and comparative advantage
How many donors or other financiers are involved in this sector and what added value
does the Bank bring?
Does the Bank Group (globally) have an established track record in this area (and how is
that demonstrated in IEG and other evidence)?
Do we have an experienced team and TTL that will be deployed, and have the requisite
expertise that might be needed not just in the specialist discipline but also in fiduciary
and safeguards?
Cementing client ownership
Is there a forceful, meaningful and formal Government request from the relevant line
Ministry(s)—with evidence of support from the Minister and the PS?
Is there the same from the Treasury—CS and PS?
Is the project explicitly identified in key Government planning documents—MTP2?
Is there a review (including political economy assessment) of any resistance to the
proposal?
Calibrating client capacity
Is there a track record of adequate client capacity in the line Ministry?
Are there credible procurement and financial management resources and expertise?
Are there integrity and corruption concerns and how will they be managed?
Where there are gaps in the above, how tenable is it that they can be addressed, including
being built and deployed through the project itself?

Not every proposal will have a “perfect score” against these four benchmarks but by testing in a
rigorous way, management can more credibly make the difficult trade-offs.
