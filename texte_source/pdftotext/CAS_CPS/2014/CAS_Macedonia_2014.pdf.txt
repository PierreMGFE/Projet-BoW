EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

i.
FYR Macedonia has come a long way in economic and social development since its
independence in 1991, yet challenges remain. The country’s early diplomatic recognition was
hampered by a dispute with Greece over the name of the country, and this continues to thwart
FYR Macedonia’s European Union (EU) accession prospects. The country stood out among its
Balkan neighbors by avoiding the inter-ethnic violence following the break-up of Yugoslavia in
the early 1990s, yet it experienced inter-ethnic unrest a decade after independence. The Ohrid
agreement of 2001 and subsequent amendments to the Constitution confirmed the rights of all
ethnic groups. Parties organized along ethnic lines define the political landscape.
ii.
The presidential and parliamentary elections of April 2014 confirmed the mandate
of the Macedonian-Albanian coalition government that has been in power since 2008, but
political divisions remain. The ruling coalition of the largest ethnic Macedonian and Albanian
parties (VMRO DPMNE and the Democratic Union for Integration (DUI)) received its widest
margin yet – 80 out of 123 seats, providing the foundation for a continued reform agenda. At the
same time, the main Macedonian opposition party (SDSM) refused to take the 34 seats won in
the election. Since then, progress has been made in terms of participation by opposition parties
in the work of the Parliament. If the country is to advance on an inclusive growth agenda, all
parties have to engage constructively in the political process, to benefit all segments of society.
iii.
The new World Bank Group Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) is based on the
World Bank’s twin goals, the Government’s vision of development and the country’s
progress towards EU accession.
iv.
The World Bank’s twin goals – to eliminate extreme poverty and promote shared
prosperity - are very relevant in fYR Macedonia because economic growth has not yet translated
into significant poverty reduction or improved welfare of the poorest 40 percent of the
population. Between 2002 and 2009, the economy grew at 3.9 percent per annum in real terms.
While average consumption growth (used as a proxy for measuring shared prosperity) increased
by 1.1 percent between 2003 and 2008, consumption growth of the bottom 40 percent decreased
by 1.5 percent annually in the same period. Although not comparable to the consumption-based
data prior to 2008, most recent income-based data for 2010 and 2011 shows a similar pattern: a
slight decline in overall income, more pronounced for the bottom 40 percent. High
unemployment is a critical feature of the story, with poor labor market outcomes
disproportionally affecting the bottom 40 percent, many of whom also have less education and
lower quality housing. FYR Macedonia stands out in the region for its recent progress in
decreasing unemployment,1 albeit from very high levels. Unemployment remains high at around
28 percent of the labor force, and productivity and wages are low. Sustaining the recent
employment creation momentum and translating economic growth into jobs and income will
help reduce poverty and improve the standard of living of all Macedonians. Therefore, helping
1

Since the outbreak of the crisis fYR Macedonia managed to decrease unemployment from 32.4 percent in 2009 to
28.6 percent in 2013.

i

the authorities to tackle these important challenges is a crucial reason for continued World Bank
Group (WBG) engagement.
v.
The Government of fYR Macedonia has a clear vision of development, which is
consistent with the Bank’s twin goals. This vision seeks to improve the welfare of all citizens
in fYR Macedonia, including those in the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution, based on
economic growth through competitiveness, which is to be achieved through improvements in
business climate, infrastructure and human capital. FYR Macedonia’s key strategies of
development, including the National Strategy for Reduction of Poverty and Social Exclusion in
the Republic of Macedonia for 2010-2020 and the recently adopted South East Europe 2020
Strategy, set out specific targets in these thematic areas, to which Bank assistance can contribute.
vi.
EU accession is the main anchor of the reform agenda. All major political parties and
over 80 percent of the people continue to support EU membership. FYR Macedonia became an
EU Candidate country in 2005 and since 2009 the European Commission (EC) has been
recommending opening accession negotiations with fYR Macedonia, but the decision continues
to be postponed in part due to the name dispute with Greece. The Government of fYR
Macedonia is committed to the accession agenda, and the country has recently confirmed its
participation in the South East Europe 2020 Strategy, which sets out specific goals for growth
that is integrated, smart, sustainable, inclusive, and pursued with good governance. The EC has
an active program of assistance to fYR Macedonia, which includes financing through the
Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA), the largest source of concessional funds in the
country.
vii.
During the CPS period, in-depth analytical work will be undertaken to reduce the
current knowledge gaps around poverty. Knowledge gaps remain due to a lack of reliable
poverty data that reduce the reliability to identify the most critical drivers of poverty reduction
and the transmission channels for increased shared prosperity. Thus in defining the two pillars of
the CPS with the authorities, the Bank used growth and competitiveness, and skills and
inclusion, as the main proxies based on our current understanding of the economic and social
context in fYR Macedonia as well as our experience from the portfolio we are supporting. The
Bank has also embarked on the preparation of an in-depth poverty and drivers of growth
analysis, the findings of which will be used to refine the proposed program, as needed, together
with the authorities and make adjustments as appropriate at mid-term. The Bank will also apply a
social filter for every operation to inform project design in order to maximize their social impact.
Finally, during the latter part of the CPS implementation period, the Bank will launch the
Systematic Country Diagnostic for fYR Macedonia to inform the next strategy which will be a
Country Partnership Framework2.
viii. The CPS will focus on two interrelated themes: i) Growth and Competitiveness; and
ii) Skills and Inclusion. Both are crucial for eliminating extreme poverty and boosting shared
prosperity in fYR Macedonia. For Growth and Competitiveness, successful poverty reduction
would need sustained private sector led growth, making fYR Macedonia more attractive as a
destination for investments and as a country whose private companies can compete at the
2

regional and global level. Key outcomes targeted under this pillar are improved fiscal and public
financial management for better use of public resources to support growth, further increase of
private investment and export capacity, strengthened road infrastructure management and better
provision of clean energy through public and private investments - crucial for the country’s
further regional integration. The Government has already achieved impressive results in this area
which is one of its key strategic objectives, including as part of the Innovation Strategy 20132015 and the “Europe 2020” Strategy. For Skills and Inclusion, the fruits of growth can be
shared broadly if more Macedonians have access to better jobs and if public services are of good
quality and delivered efficiently. Key outcomes to which this pillar will contribute are skills
better adapted to the labor market, more opportunities for disadvantaged groups and better access
to basic services. In addition, a focus on improved governance and transparency is essential both
for a predictable and stable investment climate and as a foundation of an inclusive multi-ethnic
society with broad economic participation. To promote productivity through new skills and
competitive technologies, IFC will continue its efforts to assist in attracting and supporting
foreign investment. More broadly, the WBG will offer a full range of financial, knowledge and
convening services in support of these goals, providing assistance in selected sectors to catalyze
a significant impact by leveraging competitive advantages of the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) resources.
ix.
Since fYR Macedonia’s future is clearly linked to European integration, the CPS
will actively promote the EU accession agenda and this will represent a cross- cutting
theme. The strategy is consistent with the new EU Assistance Country Strategy Paper for 20142020. In particular, the Bank will contribute to the accession agenda by supporting investments
for fYR Macedonia’s income convergence with the EU, promoting better economic governance,
helping the development of institutions and changes in the legal framework, as well as improving
the efficiency of the use of EU’s instrument of pre-accession (IPA) assistance. At the project
level, the Bank will coordinate project design and implementation with the EU in order to
maximize synergies and use the capacity building opportunities of Bank financed operations to
support fYR Macedonia’s ability to absorb IPA funds. The WBG will also explore opportunities
for joint projects with the EU and other development partners in order to minimize transaction
costs and increase the impact of resources available to fYR Macedonia for the country’s
inclusive and sustainable development.

I. COUNTRY CONTEXT AND DEVELOPMENT AGENDA
A. Political Context
1.
FYR Macedonia has come a long way since its independence in 1991 yet political
challenges remain, impacting the country’s growth and development. The country’s early
diplomatic recognition was hampered by a dispute with Greece over the name of the country, and
this continues to thwart fYR Macedonia’s EU accession prospects. The country stood out among
its Balkan neighbors by avoiding the inter-ethnic violence following the break-up of Yugoslavia
in the early 1990s, yet it experienced inter-ethnic unrest a decade after independence. The Ohrid
agreement of 2001 and subsequent amendments to the Constitution confirmed the rights of all
ethnic groups3. Parties organized along ethnic lines define the political landscape.
2.
The presidential and parliamentary elections of April 2014 confirmed the mandate
of the government coalition that has been in power since 2008, although political divisions
remain. The ruling coalition of the largest ethnic Macedonian and Albanian parties (VMRO
DPMNE and DUI) received its widest margin yet – 80 out of 123 seats, providing foundation for
continued reform agenda. At the same time, the main Macedonian opposition party (SDSM)
refused to take the 34 seats won in the election. Since then, some progress has been made in
terms of participation by opposition parties in the work of the Parliament. If the country is to
advance on the inclusive growth agenda, all parties have to engage constructively in the political
process, to benefit all segments of society, drawing on the country’s strong track record of peace
and stability.
3.
EU accession remains the main anchor of the reform agenda. All major political
parties and over 80 percent of the people continue to support EU membership. The country
gained EU candidate status in 2005, and since 2009 the EC has been recommending opening
accession negotiations with fYR Macedonia, but the decision continues to be postponed in large
part due to the name dispute with Greece. Since March 2012 the Commission has been
conducting the High Level Accession Dialogue with the Government of fYR Macedonia. In
December 2013, the EU General Affairs Council issued a resolution confirming the EC’s
recommendation to open accession negotiations, noting that the political criteria continue to be
sufficiently met and proposing to “revert to the issue in 2014, on the basis of an update by the EC
on further implementation of reforms in the context of the High Level Accession Dialogue,
including the implementation of the 1 March political agreement and on tangible steps taken to
promote good neighborly relations and to reach a negotiated and mutually accepted solution to
the name issue.”

3

According to the last official census of 2002 fYR Macedonia is an ethnically diverse country, with 64.2 percent of
the population made up of ethnic Macedonians, 25.2 percent ethnic Albanians, 3.9 percent ethnic Turks, 2.7 percent
Roma, 0.5 percent Vlachs, 1.8 percent Serbs, 0.8 percent Bosnians, and 1.0 percent others.

B. Growth and Inclusion Diagnostic
Sources of Growth
4.
FYR Macedonia is a small, landlocked and open economy with a sound track record
of macro-fiscal stability. With an openness indicator4 of 126.3 percent in 2013, it is the most
open among the countries of South East Europe (SEE)5. FYR Macedonia has been able to
preserve macroeconomic stability in the presence of adverse shocks. Its exchange rate peg to the
Euro, introduced in 1995, has successfully supported price stability, with inflation averaging 2.4
percent over the last 10 years. Macroeconomic policies have been geared towards keeping the
external balance manageable, and monetary policy has responded quickly to any possible threats
to the peg. General government debt, which reached 35.8 percent of Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) at the end of 2013, is the fifth lowest among the EU and SEE countries6, and public sector
debt at 43.2 percent of GDP at end 2013 is the second lowest among the SEE countries. Growth
volatility has been low by regional standards.
5.
Growth would need to accelerate for fYR Macedonia to close its income gap with
the new EU member states. Between 2002 and 2009, fYR Macedonia grew at 3.9 percent
annually in real terms, which enabled the country to reduce its income gap with the EU.
Between 2002 and 2009, fYR Macedonia’s income per capita grew from 25 percent of the EU’s
GDP per capita to 36 percent in 2009. Since then, average GDP growth has declined to 2.1
percent per year and convergence to the EU has stalled. Real GDP growth would need to
accelerate to around 4.5 percent – significantly above the ten-year average of 3.2 percent – for
fYR Macedonia to converge to the living standards of the new EU member states within the next
20 years.
6.
FYR Macedonia’s sectoral drivers of growth have changed noticeably over the past
15 years, with trade and commerce declining and construction taking over as the fastest
growing sector. Prior to 2002, over 80 percent of growth came from trade and commerce,
industry and wholesale and retail. Since 2002, growth in trade and commerce has dropped while
industrial growth remained stable. Since 2009, the construction sector has become the
predominant driver of growth as the public sector scaled up capital spending to counterbalance
the decline in external demand due to the Euro zone crisis. This seems to have come at the
expense of quality of public investment: the share of investment in administrative buildings
increased while investment in infrastructure and maintenance dropped7.
7.
FYR Macedonia’s growth was driven by both employment and productivity gains
before the crisis, but most job creation occurred in low-productivity sectors or in the public
sector. The country made impressive gains by reducing the unemployment rate from 38 percent
in 2004 to around 28 percent in 2013, yet the rate remains high in comparison to the recent EU
entrants such as Croatia (17 percent in 2013), Bulgaria (13 percent) and Romania (7 percent).
4

The openness indicator is defined as the sum of imports and exports relative to GDP.
SEE countries include Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Macedonia fYR, Montenegro and Serbia.
6
Gross public sector debt, which includes the debt of municipalities and public enterprises, but not the debt of the
Central Bank, stood at 43.2 percent of the GDP in 2013.
7
In 2008, 85 percent of all public investment was destined to infrastructure while only 15 percent went to nonresidential and residetial buildings. By 2012, investments in non-residential and residential buildings doubled as a
share of total public investment, reaching 33 percent.
5

2

Despite a relatively large and rising capital share of income from 2001-2008 (between 40 and 50
percent), physical capital accumulation accounted for only 0.3 percentage points of the average
annual 4.3 percent GDP growth between 2002 and 2008, whereas employment growth
contributed 1 percentage point, and Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth roughly 3 percentage
points. After the 2008 crisis, productivity growth decelerated significantly while employment
continued to grow. In fact, fYR Macedonia is the only SEE country where employment
increased in the post-crisis period. Agriculture, construction and public administration have been
the main drivers of employment growth over the last decade. However, the jobs created in the
past years have been either informal, in low-productivity sectors or in the public sector: 27.1
percent of net jobs created between 2007 and 2011 have been in agriculture, 13 percent in retail
trade (predominantly informal) and 19.7 percent in the public sector8. The share of net jobs
created in agriculture is high when considering that agricultural growth has been weak
throughout the last decade and averaged zero since 2009.
8.
Growth in the pre-crisis years was powered by domestic demand, engendering
relatively large and persistent trade deficits and increasing household indebtedness. In the
years leading up to the 2009 crisis, real GDP growth was underpinned by strong private
consumption and rapidly increasing investment, both of which had a large import content and
pushed the trade deficit from an already-large 17.8 percent of GDP in 2005 to around 26 percent
by 2008. The trade deficit was largely financed by remittances which in turn fueled private
consumption. Household debt rose rapidly, albeit from low levels by regional standards.9 Since
the crisis, disposable incomes made a modest recovery thanks to wage and employment growth,
increased social transfers as part of the crisis response, and an easing of the tax burden on
personal income. At the same time, household consumption declined, bringing it closer in line
with disposable income. This renewed savings impetus has helped to stabilize the household
debt ratio, which stood at 25.8 percent of disposable income at end-2012.
9.
Expansionary fiscal policy in the aftermath of the crisis led to a widening of the
fiscal deficit and a rapid build-up in central government debt. Revenues fell by over 3
percent of GDP between 2008 and 2011, as economic activity weakened and the Government
reduced tax rates and social security contributions to boost competitiveness. Consequently, the
fiscal deficit widened consecutively from 0.9 percent of GDP in 2008 to 2.5 percent in 2011, 3.9
percent in 2012 and 4.1 percent in 2013 and central government debt surged from 20.7 percent in
2008 to 35.6 percent by the end of 2013 (see Table 1 in Annex 3). At the same time, the
Government shifted a part of capital expenditure off-budget by transforming the former Road
Fund into the Public Enterprise for State Roads (PESR). At inception, the PESR carried EUR 82
million in debt (1.1 percent of GDP), but this is set to rise in the near term as the PESR executes
strategic priorities of the central government’s investment agenda. Based on planned borrowings
by the PESR and other State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) to finance an ambitious agenda of
infrastructure and other investments, total public sector debt under the baseline scenario is
projected to reach 44.3 percent of GDP in 2014 and increase up to 54.1 percent of GDP in 2018,
around 15 percentage points higher than the debt of the central government alone.10

10.
As a small, open economy fYR Macedonia will have to rely on exports and increased
competitiveness to sustain long-term growth. Supported by an active strategy to promote
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), fYR Macedonia is shifting gradually to a more export-led
growth model. In recent years, fYR Macedonia has diversified its exports both in terms of
products and destinations and increased the technological intensity of its export basket due to
FDI. On the other hand, small and medium Macedonian companies face challenges of
integration into international markets due to lack of managerial, financial and technical capacity,
which limits their competitiveness. While multinational firms have made an impact on
employment and growth of new industries with better long-term prospects, their limited
backward linkages to domestic companies prevent a broader impact on the economy. FYR
Macedonia will need to boost and upgrade its exports further to improve its competitiveness by
investing in infrastructure, stronger investment climate, facilitating business growth and trade
linkages, and supporting innovation. This will help the country to attract additional investments
for sustained private sector-led growth. Continued efforts to improve competitiveness are
particularly important for Macedonia given its exchange rate peg to the Euro.
Poverty and Shared Prosperity
11.
Economic growth and increases in employment in fYR Macedonia have not yet
translated into tangible poverty reduction according to available data. Despite data
challenges in monitoring recent poverty trends in fYR Macedonia11, the existing evidence shows
that consumption-based absolute poverty between 2003 and 2008 (from the Household Budget
Survey (HBS)) increased from 8 to 9 percent using a regional poverty line of US$2.5 a day, and
from 33 percent to 37 percent, using a regional poverty line of US$5 a day. During the same
period, official relative poverty statistics12 remained largely unchanged at around 30 percent.
FYR Macedonia has recently adopted a new way of measuring poverty through the incomebased Survey of Income and Living Conditions (SILC). Under this new relative measure
available for 2010 and 2011, poverty has also remained unchanged (27.3 in 2010 and 27.1 in
2011).13 Inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, increased between 2003 and 2008 in
fYR Macedonia from 37 to 40 using consumption data.14 Income-based data for the years 2010
and 2011 suggests a modest decrease in inequality with a Gini coefficient of 40.8 and 39.2,
respectively.
12.
The welfare of the poorest 40 percent of the population has not improved either.
Consumption growth of the bottom 40 percent – the World Bank indicator for the new
institutional goal of promoting shared prosperity - decreased by 1.5 percent annually between
2003 and 2008, as average consumption grew by 1.1 percent. The difference between annual
growth in average consumption and consumption of the bottom 40 percent was particularly
11

Monitoring the evolution of poverty in fYR Macedonia has become challenging in recent years due to concerns
over data quality of the HBS, particularly from 2009 onwards. Therefore, the HBS series is used until 2008 until
further diagnostics are carried out. The Survey of Income and Living Conditions (SILC) started in 2010 in fYR
Macedonia, and data available thus far is limited to 2010 and 2011. Recently, official poverty rates in fYR
Macedonia started to be reported with income-based data from the SILC.
12
Measured at 70 percent of median consumption.
13
This indicator, called population at-risk-of–poverty, is measured at 60 percent of median equalized income, same
as in countries in the European Union.
14
Other measures of inequality follow a similar trend. For instance, between 2003 and 2008 the ratio of the 90th/10th
percentiles increased from 5.7 to 6.4, and the ratio of the 75th/25th increased from 2.4 to 2.7.

4

striking in 2003 and 2006, when the mean grew at 3.2 percent, while consumption of the bottom
40 percent fell by 0.4 percent. Growth incidence curves show that those in the top two quintiles
of the distribution had higher than average welfare gains while those in the bottom three quintiles
were below average. Although not comparable, recent income-based data for 2010 and 2011
shows a slight decline in overall income, more pronounced for the bottom 40 percent.

The probability of being poor or among the bottom 40 percent is strongly associated
with labor market status, gender and limited access to economic opportunities. According
to a recent study on shared prosperity in the region of SEE15, the poor and those in the bottom
40 percent in fYR Macedonia are more likely to:

15

World Bank. 2013. “First Insights into Promoting Shared Prosperity in South East Europe”, part of the 5th edition
of the South East Europe Regular Economic Report 2013.

5

 Live in larger households and have more dependents, especially children, which
contrasts with that of the well-off, who have smaller households, fewer children and a
relatively higher share of members over 65 years old. In fYR Macedonia 49 percent of the
bottom 40 percent of the population live in households with five or more members,
significantly higher than the 21 percent mark for the top 60 percent of the population.
 Have lower levels of educational achievement: people aged 15 and older in the bottom
40 percent are more likely to have no education or incomplete primary education, and are
less likely to have attained tertiary education. The share of adults (15 +) with at most
primary education in the bottom 40 percent is around 55 percent, while for the top 60 percent
this number is 37 percent. Returns from tertiary education – although high in fYR
Macedonia – are out of reach for the bottom 40 percent: the average wage of this group only
reaches 62 percent of the average wage of the top 60 percent.
 Not have accumulated other assets: e.g., in terms of financial assets, a lower share of
individuals in the bottom 40 percent (16 percent of the group) saved money in the past year,
compared to those in the top 60 percent (25 percent).
14.
While women are equally represented among the poor, women likely have fewer
opportunities to escape poverty than men given that they are less educated and are significantly
more likely to be jobless, particularly given the very high inactivity rates (see Figure 3).
Although gender gaps are seen across the population, they can be particularly limiting for
women, as both education and access to jobs are key factors of upward economic mobility.
15.
The share of employed adults among those of working age is lower for the less welloff in fYR Macedonia. For instance, the share of employees in the working age population (age
15-64) is only 35 percent for the bottom 40 percent, while it increases to around 42 percent for
the rest of the population. This gap between socio-economic groups is mostly driven by higher
inactivity rates among the less well-off, given that unemployment rates are high across the board.
16.
The rural population is overrepresented in the bottom 40 percent, suggesting
differences in economic opportunities in rural areas. Rural population accounts for 36 percent of
the total population of the country, yet half of the bottom 40 percent live in rural areas.
17.
The Roma16 are a particularly vulnerable group in fYR Macedonia. According to a
2011 World Bank/EU/United Nations Development Program (UNDP) survey, the absolute
poverty rate for Roma (PPP US$4.30 income based) is 41 percent, as compared to 14 percent for
the non-Roma population. The average Roma adult (age 25-64) has completed 6 years of
education, compared to 10.5 years for the rest of the population. While unemployment rates are
high in fYR Macedonia as a whole despite recent progress with its reduction, 53 percent of
Roma adults (ages 15-64) are unemployed, as compared to 28 percent of the whole population.
Roma are also among the group of workers that are likely to receive less than the minimum wage
from their employers. Differences exist also in health and housing conditions, and Roma women
lag behind men on most counts.

16

The most recent official census data of Roma living in fYR Macedonia are from the 2002 Population Census,
which registered 53.879 Roma citizens - approximately 2.7percent of the total population.

Gender
18.
FYR Macedonia has largely closed average gender gaps in education and health;
however, gender disparities persist for certain population subgroups17. Gender gaps in
enrollment rates still exist among ethnic Albanians, and secondary enrollment rates remain low
for ethnic Roma men and women. Average learning outcomes are better for women than for
men in fYR Macedonia, as in most countries in the region. Men and women, however, tend to
choose different fields of study: women are more likely to choose general programs and subjects
related to the social sciences, while men often study engineering, production, or construction.
There is no evidence of gender-based differences in access to health services, and the country
performs well when it comes to births attended by skilled health staff and adolescent fertility.
19.
Gender inequalities remain in access to economic opportunities in fYR Macedonia.
In 2012, female labor force participation (for women aged 15-65) in fYR Macedonia was 51
percent, below the regional average of 62 percent. Moreover, between 2004 and 2012, male
labor force participation increased by 6 percentage points while female labor force participation
increased by 4 percentage points, bringing gender gap in participation to 26 percentage points in
2012. For those in the labor market, unemployment rates for men and women are similar.
Gender wage gap persists, even after controlling for other characteristics, with men receiving
higher wages. The World Bank Enterprise Survey (2013) shows that women own 29.4 percent
and manage 26.3 percent of the businesses interviewed.

representative at the population level.

20.
Gender gaps in accessing economic opportunities are tightly linked to differences
across ethnic groups. Available data indicate that labor force participation among ethnic
minorities is often significantly lower than among ethnic Macedonians, especially among women
(Figure 3). Whereas ethnic Macedonian women have an employment rate of 41 percent, only 10
percentage points lower than their male counterparts, women who are ethnically Turkish have an
employment rate of 27 percent - a 32 percentage point gap with men of the same ethnic
background. Roma and ethnic Albanian women lag even further behind in terms of employment,

17

with employment rates of only 7 and 6 percent, respectively. Activity rates among ethnic
minorities are two or three times lower among women than among men.
21.
FYR Macedonia has made continuing progress in advancing gender relations. The
legal framework for gender equality is comprehensive and provides for equal treatment of both
genders. The 2005 Labor Code endorses the definition of gender-based discrimination and
provides a framework for anti-discrimination measures. According to the Law on Family all
forms of abuse are prohibited, while the Law on Inheritance gives equal rights to men and
women. The Criminal Code punishes gender-based discrimination and all forms of domestic
abuse and violence. The Law on Equal Opportunities was adopted in May 2006 and amended in
2012. A new Strategy for Gender Equality (2013-2020) was adopted in 2013 and accompanied
by a National Action Plan (2013-2016).
C. Medium-Term Prospects and Risks
22.
In the medium term fYR Macedonia’s growth is expected to accelerate, supported
by a recovery of domestic demand, growth-friendly public investments and exports. Under
the baseline projections, real GDP growth is expected to reach 3.0 percent in 2014 and accelerate
to 3.5 and 3.7 percent in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Domestic private demand is expected to
recover on the back of recent increases in public wages and pensions and a continued decline in
unemployment. Externally financed public investment in key transport corridors will increase.
Export growth will be driven by a rebound of external demand as the Eurozone recovers and by
new FDI related exports coming on line. There are several risks to this medium-term outlook.
23.
Macroeconomic risks stem from a potential deterioration of the Euro area economic
outlook and an increase in oil prices. A slower than projected pace of recovery in the Euro
area could lead to lower than expected growth, exports and FDI. FYR Macedonia has a
relatively high exposure to neighboring countries, especially Greece and Italy, through
remittances and exports. Its large trade deficit (21 percent of GDP in 2013) is financed mostly
through private transfers. About 50 percent of fYR Macedonia’s current account deficit is oilrelated, making it very sensitive to oil price changes. Increasing FDI, enhancing linkages
between foreign firms and local suppliers, reducing energy imports, and strengthening
competitiveness will be critical for reducing fYR Macedonia’s reliance on private transfers and
its exposure to external risks.
24.
External financing needs are expected to rise in the medium term, but reserve
adequacy should remain robust and external debt is projected to decline. External financing
needs will reach around 15 percent of GDP in 2015 as payments on the 2009 Eurobond fall due
and the current account widens as domestic demand recovers and FDI-related imports increase.
Still, capacity to service existing external obligations is set to remain strong, with gross
international reserves projected to average around 4.5 months of imports, covering roughly 150
percent of short-term external debt. Strong FDI inflows and a favorable growth-interest rate
differential on external borrowing are expected to place external debt on a gradual downward
path from its peak of 67.7 percent of GDP at end-2013 to 62.4 percent by 2018.
25.
FYR Macedonia’s ambitious public investment program, while important for
competitiveness and growth, is likely to lead to an increase in public debt. Even under the
assumption that gross central government debt stabilizes over the medium term, public sector
debt is set to rise rapidly, as SOEs take over much of the investment spending. Stabilizing gross
8

central government debt will require a strong political commitment to implement the 2013
medium-term fiscal framework, which foresees a reduction in central government deficit from a
4.1 percent of GDP in 2013 to 2.6 percent in 201618. This will also require Government
commitment to open up private sector investments in the infrastructure and services sectors
through PPPs.
26.
FYR Macedonia is vulnerable to climate change and is at a high risk of natural
disasters, such as floods, droughts and earthquakes. As discussed in the recent Green Growth
report19, a whole range of “no regrets” measures exist that could put the country on a greener and
more sustainable growth path. For instance, energy efficiency could reduce demand and so put
the country on a more sustainable and green development path, while helping to reduce fiscal
pressure through energy cost reduction. Upgrading infrastructure services (water supply and
sanitation, wastewater treatment, and solid waste collection) would help improve social,
economic, and environmental quality of human settlements and living and working environment
and put them on a more sustainable path. Continued development of the insurance mechanisms
can help limit the financial damage of natural disasters to which fYR Macedonia is prone.
27.
Finally, one cannot rule out the risk of political instability. FYR Macedonia has thus
far managed to avoid the worst outcomes of a political system drawn along ethnic lines, with
coalition governments crossing the ethnic divide and considerable efforts made to enshrine nondiscrimination in the legal and regulatory framework. Nonetheless, frustrations over the slow
pace of EU accession coupled with a slow decline in unemployment pose an underlying threat of
instability and unrest that cannot be ignored in the quest for higher growth and better jobs.
D. Challenges and Opportunities for Shared Prosperity
28.
To reduce poverty and promote shared prosperity, fYR Macedonia needs to
increase private sector-led job creation, improve access to economic opportunities and
basic services for the less well-off, and remove structural barriers that prevent certain
social groups from progressing. Recent growth rates, while encouraging in the local context,
are not sufficient for meaningful convergence with the EU. Moreover, growth so far has not
translated into sufficient job creation or improvement in the welfare of the bottom 40 percent. In
addition to spurring growth, the Government needs to prioritize social and economic inclusion.
Challenge: Job creation through faster growth and better competitiveness
Fiscal and public financial management
29.
Continued macroeconomic stability and improved public financial management are
the foundation of future growth in fYR Macedonia. Fiscal policies have in the past supported
growth through increases in public employment and investment. Going forward, a more growthfriendly expenditure mix and improvements in fiscal management will be important to improve
the efficiency and efficacy of public spending and support growth in the context of fiscal
tightening at the central government level. It will be particularly important that public
investment focuses on sectors that have a higher multiplier effect on the economy, including
18

The Government has submitted to the Parliament a constitutional amendment, expected to come into force in
2014, which would limit budget deficit to 3 percent and public debt to 60 percent of the GDP.

Box 1: Transparency, Accountability and Public Financial Management
FYR Macedonia has a mixed track record with
respect to fiscal transparency.
While the
governance index of the World Bank’s World
Governance Indicators and the score of the World
Economic Forum’s transparency of government
policy making index have improved since 2011, the
index of transparency of budget and accountability
as measured by the Open Budget Survey has
significantly deteriorated between 2008 and 201220
as scores on reporting and publication of audit
reports, mid-year budget updates, extra budgetary
funds and debt reporting declined and – contrary to
other countries - progress in other areas stalled.

The authorities have taken steps to improve budget transparency and accountability in 2013. The Organic
Budget Law was amended in December 2012 to improve strategic planning of public expenditures. Amendments to
the Manual of Treasury Operations included compulsory recording of multi-year liabilities. In addition, the Ministry
of Finance updated the Treasury Information System in 2013 to incorporate entry and monitoring of multi-year
liabilities. A medium-term fiscal strategy has been published in 2013. The Government also adopted the Law on
Financial Discipline in December 2013, which requires the Government to pay incurred obligations within 60 days,
thus limiting the scope for future run-ups in arrears. On the other hand, public debt statistics are fragmented and the
preparation and implementation of the medium-term fiscal framework could be improved. The Government is
working with the World Bank on a comprehensive Public Finance Review (PFR), which will help identify the scope
for further reforms in this area.
FYR Macedonia’s performance on key governance indicators could also be improved. The country ranks in the
middle of SEE countries, but significantly below the new EU member states with respect to the World Governance
Indicators (WGI). It performs best on Control of Corruption, outpacing all other SEE countries and some new EU
member states. Transparency International’s Corruption Index confirms that fYR Macedonia ranks highest (together
with Montenegro) among the SEE countries and has managed to improve its rank significantly in recent years. At
the same time, fYR Macedonia’s WGI ranking on voice and accountability deteriorated in recent years and it scores
lowest in the region on political stability indicator, reflecting weak political dialogue and frequent elections. Other
transparency concerns include a sharply deteriorating Press Freedom Index.

30.
FYR Macedonia has made improvements in the control framework over the use of
public funds, such as internal audit and external audit, which are among the priority areas for the
EU accession. The Public Internal Financial Control (PIFC) framework was established by the
Law on PIFC in 2009, followed by establishing the Central Harmonization Unit (CHU) and
internal audit and financial management and control in public sector entities. The Law on the
State Audit Office was passed in 2010, and its implementation led to an increased coverage of
audited public funds as well as strengthened capacity to perform audits. Despite these positive
developments, in order to prevent recurrence of public sector arrears further steps are needed to
control and record commitments. Other priorities in the public financial management system
include (i) improving budget revenue forecasts and adopting a more conservative approach to
setting expenditure ceilings, (ii) capacity building to strengthen the system of reporting on SOEs

10

and public debt, and (c) capacity building to strengthen the country's system of public internal
financial control.
31.
Strengthening public sector transparency is crucial for the environment of trust that
is a prerequisite for increased private investment. While fYR Macedonia has made strides in
some areas of public financial management, significant scope for improvements remains in
medium-term fiscal planning and publication of government statistics. As the Government plans
to implement a large part of its investment program through SOEs, transparency and public
disclosure of fiscal data become increasingly important.
32.
Availability of reliable data and its use for evidence-based policy-making could
significantly increase the efficiency of public investment and services. More analysis needs
to be done to understand the relationship between economic growth and job creation, and suggest
ways to improve both, yet such analysis for fYR Macedonia is constrained by the scarcity of
reliable data, in particular due to an out-of-date census that complicates defining sampling
frames for surveys.
Export, competitiveness and private investment
33.
Moving to a higher growth trajectory requires continued macroeconomic stability
and the development of a competitive export sector in fYR Macedonia. The country has
done well in maintaining macroeconomic stability through a time of global and European crisis,
creating a stable environment for investment with low inflation and manageable external
balances (see Table 1 in Annex 3). An exchange rate pegged to the Euro has been an important
anchor for this stability, but also places the burden of competitiveness on local wages and
productivity improvements. In a small open economy like fYR Macedonia, firms must look to
export markets for growth. Today, only 5 percent of manufacturing firms in fYR Macedonia
export, but this group of firms generates 55 percent of the total sales revenue in the
manufacturing sector21. The key to accessing export markets is to boost firm productivity in the
conditions of a pegged exchange rate as there is a strong relationship between exporting and
productivity: exporting firms have six times more revenue per employee than the average firm in
fYR Macedonia. Moreover, international evidence suggests that participation in export markets
helps to improve firm-level productivity, so that a competitive export sector will translate into a
more competitive and dynamic economy.
34.
The Government scaled up export promotion through the adoption of the Export
Promotion Strategy and implementation of exporter support programs. The strategy aims
to ensure that appropriate institutional mechanisms are operating at the ministerial and agency
levels, and that programs with high potential impact are put in place. The exporter support
programs help build the capabilities of those exporters aiming to increase the quality of their
products or reach new markets, which could progressively increase fYR Macedonia’s share of
medium and high-tech exports.
35.
Recent and ongoing analytic work confirms the need to continue and deepen
reforms in the area of competitiveness. In the past several years fYR Macedonia has made

significant progress in improving the business climate beyond the "first generation” of reforms
often related to the methodology of the Doing Business (DB) Report. The reforms supported by
the Business Environment Reform and Institutional Strengthening (BERIS) Project in regulatory
impact assessment and regulatory “guillotine” of existing cumbersome and outdated regulations,
improved quality infrastructure, competition and innovation policies, among others, are
important achievements in improving the business environment. Further, reforms in the
governance and efficiency of public spending for private sector and foreign investment were
supported by the Competitiveness Development Policy Loans (DPL)22.

Box 2: Global Competitiveness Report 2013-2014:
The most problematic factors for doing business in
fYR Macedonia (percent of respondents)

37.
Many challenges remain with implementation of business regulations for investment
at the municipal and regional levels, due to uneven capacity at lower levels of
administration and lack of experience in dealing with foreign companies. While fYR
Macedonia has achieved significant progress in the business environment as measured by Doing
Business 2014 (ranked 25 out of 189 countries), it is important to ensure that an efficient
environment conducive to investment is in place throughout the country. Recent efforts at
decentralization, particularly of the land administration process, create opportunities for local
authorities to improve the efficiency of the investment process (land privatization, construction
permits and business licenses).
38.
A key part of the Government’s competitiveness strategy has been attracting foreign
direct investment (FDI) through a package of proactive promotion in key markets,
incentives and special economic zones (SEZ) around Skopje, Stip, Tetovo and other cities.
These measures and SEZ infrastructure, which receive high ratings in global comparisons23,

12

resulted in increased FDI inflows, especially in medium- and high-tech manufacturing industries.
These investments jumped to EUR 78 million in 2013, accounting for net exports of EUR 87
million in 2013 and are expected to be up to EUR 190 million in 2014, with total exports of EUR
1.2 billion. The new FDIs located in and outside the SEZs employed around 5,000 workers in
2013, and this is expected to increase to 9,000 by end 2014. Companies received state aid
packages, which include tax incentives and skills training for the employees. They are also
developing cooperation with local universities and some of the companies have developed
supply linkages with domestic producers of plastic and metal products.
39.
Constraints to linkages with FDI and export competitiveness of domestic firms are
related to firm-level productivity, skills, business sophistication, and some aspects of the
business environment at the local level. Business sophistication includes two elements: the
quality of a country’s overall business networks as measured by the quantity and quality of local
suppliers and the extent of their interaction, and the quality of individual firms’ operations and
strategies. By end 2013, supply linkages between Macedonian companies and foreign investors
was estimated at EUR50 million in goods and services (including construction), with potential
for increase in the medium and long term. The Government seeks to stimulate partnerships
among foreign manufacturing companies operating in fYR Macedonia, local Small and Medium
Enterprises (SMEs) and financial institutions by providing assistance to upgrade product quality,
quantity and reliability through technical and managerial skills, business planning and access to
capital. The increased technological and business sophistication of local suppliers will, in turn,
facilitate backward linkages with FDI and stimulate exports. One important element of this
support is the Fund for Innovation and Technological Development (Innovation Fund) that was
established in 2014 and is receiving funding support from the World Bank.
Infrastructure - Roads
40.
Investments in transport infrastructure are crucial for fYR Macedonia’s
competitiveness and growth. Inadequate supply of infrastructure is the second most
problematic factor for doing business according to GCR 2013. The landlocked country needs
investment in transport infrastructure to ensure connection to regional markets, with roads
presenting a particular priority since most of the goods in fYR Macedonia, including exports, are
transported by road (in the first two quarters of 2013, 93 percent of freight). Roads are also
crucial for local competitiveness and development of tourism.
41.
Road construction, rehabilitation and upgrading is the single largest public
investment program. Of the EUR3.5 billion in currently planned public investments, roads
account for around EUR1.47 billion, or 42 percent. The World Bank is working with the
Ministry of Transport and Communications, and PESR on a new transport sector strategy
focused on evidence-based policy-making and investment decision-making, and has a large
ongoing and planned program of investment in the sector. Leveraging private sector participation
through PPPs, where feasible, could provide additional resources to the sector, including in road
management which can also be effected through concessions to the private sector.
42.
The quality of the country’s roads has been deteriorating relative to other countries.
According to the GCR fYR Macedonia’s road quality ranked 69th world-wide in 2006. By
2013, it ranked only 111th. Key challenge in the road sector relates to the establishing of a road
asset management system, which would help PESR plan a financially sustainable road
investment program (to complete the main corridor sections and improve overall road condition
13

worsened due to maintenance backlog), while safeguarding its financial sustainability.
Additional efforts are also required to improve the quality and timeliness of maintenance in order
to ensure longevity of investments carried out.
43.
Road safety remains a concern despite recent efforts to address it. The National
Council for Road Safety, which brings together all national authorities related to road safety, has
provided greater visibility to the issue of road safety. There are over 4,000 car crashes per year
in fYR Macedonia resulting in injuries or deaths of around 7,000 people. While the leading
reported cause of these is driver behavior, international experience suggests that accidents could
be significantly reduced through improvements in road infrastructure, better traffic signs and
road markings and features such as crash barriers.
44.
FYR Macedonia’s transport infrastructure is highly vulnerable to climate change.
With investments whose life span often exceeds 20 years, a failure to consider climate proofing
could lead to costly repairs and rehabilitation. Through its extensive investments in the sector,
fYR Macedonia has a unique opportunity to ensure that investments made today are not
adversely affected ten years down the line, due to the failure to consider factors such as increased
flooding or increased precipitation. At the same time, making transport infrastructure resilient
requires assessing the need to incorporate adaptation measures, whether they be for infrastructure
design or maintenance, where warranted.
Infrastructure - Energy
45.
Availability of adequate energy supply is a major constraint to fYR Macedonia’s
growth. Although overall energy consumption remains low by European standards, energy
intensity is high and presents opportunities for increased energy efficiency measures. FYR
Macedonia’s main primary energy resource is lignite, but the available lignite deposits will be
fully exploited within the next 30-45 years. Thermal power plants, mostly lignite-burning,
generate most (79.7 percent) of the country’s electricity. Hydropower is the second largest
energy source, accounting for 17.2 percent of electricity generation, with the remaining 3.2
percent supplied by imports24.
46.
With about half of fYR Macedonia’s generation capacity scheduled to close in the
next 15 years, combined with an increasing electricity demand, the country is facing the
issue of security of supply. Electricity demand has exceeded supply for a decade and the gap
has been filled with power imports at a price well above domestic costs. Investments in energy
efficiency and loss reduction, as well as development of new clean energy sources (particularly
hydro power) and improved connectivity with the regional energy grid are essential to ensure
adequate energy supply for future growth. A review of investment options carried out by the
World Bank at the request of the Government of fYR Macedonia has demonstrated that energy
efficiency measures provide the least cost option to bridging the supply/ demand gap. Specific
energy efficiency measures focused on lighting and electric appliances in households and nonresidential buildings, and aggressive reduction of distribution losses, could each deliver an
impact similar to half of all existing hydropower, at a cost much lower than any power plant.

Agriculture
47.
Agriculture in fYR Macedonia is not only a significant contributor to GDP, but also
a major employer and contributor to foreign trade and public and private consumption. In
economic terms, it is the third largest sector after services and industry. Agricultural
contribution to GDP was 11.1 percent in 2011, which is significantly higher than the ECA
average. When agro-processing is included, contribution to GDP increases to 16 percent.
Exports of agricultural products, in particular high value-added products such as wine, lamb,
fruits and vegetables, constitute 15-17 percent of the country’s total exports. In social terms, the
share of employment in agriculture is 20 percent, which is twice the ECA average. With respect
to the environment, agriculture uses around 43 percent of total freshwater withdrawals, which is
less than the average use in the ECA region. Official statistics, however, capture only a portion
of the role of agriculture, as informal and traditional transactions are rarely recorded. For
example, almost half of all agricultural workers are unpaid as they are members of agricultural
households. In addition, products are often sold at traditional markets, and water withdrawals for
irrigation are often unrecorded.
48.
Despite its overall importance for fYR Macedonia’s economy, the sector is
fragmented, poorly equipped and with obsolete technology with negative implications not
only for growth but also for shared prosperity, since rural population is overrepresented in the
bottom 40 percent. The fragmented production and lack of mechanization makes it difficult for
farmers to achieve economies of scale in production and produce the quantities required for
certain markets, constraining agricultural growth. A more efficient allocation of agricultural
subsidies, which account for 2.1 percent of GDP and predominantly support recurrent output,
could be a powerful tool for the sector’s greater competitiveness. For example, spending more
resources on irrigation will be critical to increase production of high-value added crops.
Progress on land consolidation and development of a functioning land market would also be
important to make the sector more productive. Institutional bottlenecks inhibit the functioning of
the agricultural land market and refusal of banks to accept agricultural land as collateral have
significantly constrained productivity.
49.
FYR Macedonia is making progress on addressing some of the sector’s challenges.
The Bank has been supporting reforms in the agriculture sector through analytic and advisory
activities as well as through lending, such as the recently closed Agriculture Strengthening and
Accession Project and the Competitiveness DPL series. In particular, the Government is
advancing on creating conditions for more efficient land use with the enactment of the Law for
the Sale of State-Owned Agriculture Land in mid-2013 and subsequent implementation of the
first Annual Program for the Sale of State-Owned Agricultural Land. The sale of state-owned
agricultural land could have a major impact on agricultural productivity and generate up to EUR
500 million in fiscal revenues over the coming years. The Government has asked the Bank to
target this crucial issue through its program and it has chosen to work with other development
partners, in particular the EU on other challenges in agriculture.
50.
Agriculture is also the economic sector most directly harmed by a changing climate.
Both water scarcity and water demand for irrigation are predicted to rise. Irrigation is already
insufficient and poorly designed for today’s small farms. Many farms depend on local wells and
unsustainable extracted groundwater, which is neither regulated nor priced. Soil fertility
problems will worsen with a changing climate, especially erosion.

15

Water
51.
FYR Macedonia’s surface and groundwater resources support municipal,
industrial, power sector, and agricultural uses, with the agricultural irrigation sector
accounting for 43 percent of annual withdrawals. In addition to these water-using sectors of
the economy, fYR Macedonia’s mountainous landscape has long supported hydropower
generation, which remains an important though not the dominant source for electric power.
Most of the country’s water resources are generated internally, through rainfall, and are
somewhat more heavily concentrated in the western portion of the country – most of the
hydropower infrastructure is also located in western Macedonia.
52.
The water sector is already experiencing the effects of climate change, and these are
likely to increase in the future. As the climate warms and dries, competition for water between
agriculture, the power sector (for hydropower, a critical element in a lower emissions electricity
system, and for thermal cooling), and industrial and municipal uses will pose difficult tradeoffs
for Macedonian policymakers by 2020 unless efficiency in both demand and supply is bolstered.
The growing scarcity of water can be addressed, first of all, by reducing inefficiencies through
pricing and regulation of groundwater and through rehabilitation and maintenance of existing
infrastructure. Growing seasonal scarcity can be managed through investment in more storage
(for irrigation and for hydropower), while overall shortages in future decades can be addressed
through encouragement of water conservation.

53.
Improving the country’s labor market performance and economic competitiveness –
key paths to reducing poverty and promoting shared prosperity - will require a more
skilled and better educated labor force and a reduction in barriers to employment. Lack of
skills has been identified as a critical constraint to fYR Macedonia’s competitiveness25, and it is

Constraints and Opportunities in Automotive, Apparel, Agribusiness, and Logistic Services.

also consistently mentioned as a key constraint in GCR and BEEPS. While access to education
has improved, challenges remain in the provision of integrative “new economy” skills, and in
better linking the products of the education system to private sector needs, as companies
complain about the quality and availability of skills despite high unemployment. The secondary
Vocational Education and Training (VET) and higher education systems emphasize traditional
cognitive skills, and in the case of secondary VET, focus is on narrowly-defined occupational
profiles with low vertical and horizontal flexibility26. Yet, as Figure 4 shows, the demand for
skills has been moving away from routine, cognitive activities towards “new economy” skills
that include non-routine cognitive (critical thinking and problem-solving) and non-cognitive
skills (interpersonal skills, team work, work ethic, grit). Firm surveys in fYR Macedonia also
show that firms place equal value on cognitive and non-cognitive skills, and that the latter are
particularly lacking27. Additional barriers to employment exist for young workers and for
women, including access to productive inputs.
Protecting the vulnerable
54.
Providing better protection to vulnerable households and enhanced access to public
services for the less well-off are necessary for achieving the twin goals in fYR Macedonia.
The social assistance system is complex and performs reasonably well by regional standards, but
suffers from both inclusion and exclusion errors. The coverage of social assistance in fYR
Macedonia is low at 5.7
percent of the total

social assistance transfers account for only about 24 percent of total consumption. The last resort
social assistance programs are modest and the share of the transfer in post-transfer consumption
of the poorest quintile is around 25 percent.
55.
The Ministry of Labor and Social Policy is working on reforms to improve the
system’s efficiency and effectiveness. A new Law on Social Protection was introduced in 2009
streamlining the procedures regulating the social protection system, and allowed for a rapid
response of the system to emerging priorities. This allowed the authorities to increase targeted
support in the form of energy poverty programs and conditional cash transfers in education. An
important next step was achieved with the adoption of the bylaws which introduced a
comprehensive definition of countable income for social assistance purposes.
56.
While the system could help mitigate adverse social impacts during an economic
downturn, further improvements are needed. The efforts now should be directed at
improvements of benefits targeting as well as coverage of the poorest quintile, changes of the
equivalence scales and consolidation of social assistance benefits. Possible reform options will
be underpinned by findings and recommendations of the ongoing functional analysis of the
Social Welfare Centers (SWCs) and upcoming assessment of targeting, eligibility and registry
systems, financed by the Conditional Cash Transfers (CCT) Project. The CCT Project also helps
to reduce the inter-generational transmission of poverty by linking benefits to the fulfillment of
standards for secondary school enrollment and attendance and by activating youth in families
benefiting from the SFA in order to help them make the transition into the labor market.
Closing the gap on basic services
57.
Access to basic infrastructure services, in particular in rural areas of fYR
Macedonia, is uneven, and serious gaps persist. This has a negative impact on the
competitiveness and economic growth as well as on the welfare of the bottom 40 percent, who
predominantly live in rural areas. The main problems are related to water supply and sewerage,
electricity networks, and access roads. The local road network is underdeveloped and of low
quality. Around 50 percent of local roads are dirt roads, and their maintenance is a problem.
Only 72 percent of rural population have access to a public water pipeline, compared to 88
percent for the whole population, and 9 percent of rural residents have no water access. Most
villages do not have sewerage systems and use septic tanks; uncontrolled wastewater discharge
into rivers is common. Finding appropriate and innovative low cost solutions for rural areas for
the collection and treatment of sewage (and whenever possible the reuse of the treated effluent)
is needed. In addition, only 10 percent of the rural population is covered by public municipal
collection of solid waste. Development of infrastructure for waste collection in rural areas is also
important for preservation of the environment.
II. GOVERNMENT’S VISION
58.
The Government of fYR Macedonia has a clear vision of development, which is
based on the goal of economic growth through increased competitiveness, to be achieved
through improvements in business climate, infrastructure and human capital. This vision

28

18

is presented in the Pre-Accession Economic Program 2014-2016 and is consistent with the
regional SEE 2020 Strategy29, which fYR Macedonia officially adopted.
59.
The Government’s economic program for the period of 2014 to 2018 has a strong
focus on growth, competitiveness and human capital development as the basis for
improving the welfare of the citizens. This program was part of the election platform of the
recently reelected Government and is summarized in Box 3.

III. WORLD BANK GROUP PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY
A. World Bank Group Country Engagement Model
60.
The WBG country engagement model in fYR Macedonia is determined by
selectivity based on alignment with client priorities, coordination with other development
partners, extensive analytic work and careful evaluation of areas where the Bank can bring
most value added. The Government has expressed a clear preference for WBG involvement in
three areas: competitiveness, infrastructure investments (particularly energy and transport), and
support for EU integration. Engagement in these areas is consistent with the views and programs
of other development partners, and opportunities exist for greater coordination and mutual
leveraging of support efforts. Selectivity also means that there are important development
challenges where the WBG does not foresee an active engagement, most notably in agriculture,
where the Government is working closely with the EC, although the Bank will continue
providing analytic and advisory support in the area of agricultural land market development as
part of competitiveness work. IFC will seek opportunities to support private investments in the
agribusiness sector through banking sector as well as advisory services.
61.
The Bank’s engagement is guided by the WBG’s twin goals of reducing poverty and
boosting shared prosperity in a sustainable manner. Poverty and shared prosperity analysis
informs both the choice of specific operations and their design and implementation. The country
team is also implementing a social filter, a tool for project teams to maximize the social impact
of Bank finance operations, to further strengthen the alignment of the World Bank portfolio with
the twin goals.
Lessons from the previous CPS
62.
As described in the attached fYR Macedonia FY11-14 Country Partnership
Strategy Completion Report (see Annex 2), the previous CPS was largely successful. The
objective of the FY11-14 CPS was to support faster, more inclusive and greener growth while
helping the country to prepare for EU accession. The CPS focused Bank Group support in three
areas of engagement: (i) faster growth – competitiveness; (ii) more inclusive growth –
employability and social protection and (iii) greener growth – environmental sustainability and
climate action. During the CPS period the World Bank committed US$534.4 million, of which
US$98 million was Investment Project Financing, US$100 million Development Policy Lending
and US$336.4 million Policy Based Guarantees. IFC invested US$63.3 million: US$23.7 million
in the financial sector, US$35 million in manufacturing and US$4.6 million in energy. In
addition, IFC facilitated MIGA to issue a guarantee of US$143.9 million to the National Bank of
Greece (NBG) for covering the risk of expropriation of funds for mandatory reserves held by
Stopanska Banka, the NBG's subsidiary in the fYR Macedonia.
63.
The strategy was well aligned with client priorities and most operations achieved
their intended development objectives, but the focus on inclusion could have been
strengthened. The CPS was weighed towards Competitiveness and Greener Growth Pillars (13
and 10 outcome clusters respectively) and had fewer outcomes under the Inclusiveness Pillar (2
outcome clusters). Out of 29 CPS outcomes, 20 were Achieved, further seven were Mostly
Achieved, one Not Achieved and one Not Verified. The Inclusiveness Pillar had a relatively
lower percentage of fully achieved outcomes than the Competitiveness and Greener Growth
20

Pillars. The Bank program was appropriately selective, but the CPS results framework was
deemed too complex and not used by the Bank as a practical monitoring tool.
64.
The CPS was based on a partnership between the World Bank and IFC, which
resulted in a joint Business Plan for fYR Macedonia. IFC has worked with the private sector
supporting the Government’s growth and competitiveness agenda. In the future, greater effort
needs to be made to involve MIGA in the WBG program in fYR Macedonia. The WBG tailored
its support in response to changing circumstances. Just-in-time aid was effective in dealing with
the new challenges and provided timely support to the Government while also ensuring that most
outcomes were achieved. The Bank has been able to offer high-quality development solutions to
the Government while preparing new lending operations in response to changed circumstances
within 6 to 12 months. The Government’s commitment is crucial for IFC’s success with publicprivate partnership transactions.
Lessons from the Country Portfolio Performance Review
65.
The portfolio of World Bank financed operations in fYR Macedonia30 consists of six
investment projects, with total commitment of US$299.4 million, out of which 44 percent
(US$132.5 million) remains undisbursed. The latest Country Portfolio Performance Review
(CPPR) held in November, 2013 concluded that project objectives and associated results
frameworks remain relevant, and projects are making good progress towards these objectives.
Other key messages coming out of the CPPR were as follows:
 Working relationship between the Government and the Bank is strong. All
implementing agencies are willing to continue with new operations.
 Implementing agencies have sufficient capacity to implement the projects
successfully. Although a small number of implementation bottlenecks have been identified,
by and large project implementation mechanisms are working. All Bank financed operations
include capacity building to further improve implementation.
 Focusing on a smaller number of operations makes sense given a constrained
lending envelope. Over the last few years the Bank has reduced the number of active
projects, from 15 in 2009 to six in 2014. Focusing on a small number of operations allows
the Government to use Bank resources more strategically. Selectivity should continue to
guide Bank engagement in fYR Macedonia.
 Investment needs in fYR Macedonia remain large. To meet these needs, the WBG
should work with other development partners, through coordinating strategies and joining
efforts where appropriate, as well as through using capacity building activities under Bank
financed operations to improve fYR Macedonia’s access to other funds, most notably IPA.
Results of the consultations process and client survey
66.
Public consultations across a broad spectrum of stakeholders in fYR Macedonia
demonstrated strong support for the objectives and scope of the proposed strategy. As
described in Box 4, there is consensus that CPS areas of focus fit well with the country’s central
goals of reducing poverty and unemployment. Key recommendations emerging from the
30

Country Portfolio Performance Review covered only IBRD-financed operations. In addition, IFC has disbursed
outstanding loans for US$59.7 million and equity for US$7.42 million. MIGA has two active guarantees in fYR
Macedonia for the total amount of US$143.9 million.

21

consultation process and reflected in the proposed strategy were that a stronger emphasis should
be put on the most vulnerable groups – women, long-term unemployed and youth, and that the
Bank should play a more active role in building in-country capacity for a more efficient use of
EU’s pre-accession financing, particularly in the area of environment.
Box 4: CPS Consultations
The World Bank and IFC Country Offices held joint public consultations on the new Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) with the following groups: government officials in key sectors, donors and development partners,
representatives of Parliamentary Commissions across the political spectrum, academia and Non-Government
Organizations (NGOs), and representatives of the private sector. Consultations took place in the World Bank
Office and in the Macedonian Parliament between December 17, 2013 and February 20, 2014. All groups of
stakeholders expressed strong support to the objectives and scope of the proposed new Strategy, and welcomed
the opportunity to be involved in its discussion. There was general consensus that the Strategy’s main themes of
growth and competitiveness, and skills and inclusion are central to fYR Macedonia’s objectives of reducing
poverty and unemployment. In this respect the focus on jobs, employability and inclusion found a particularly
enthusiastic support, and several discussants asked that special emphasis be put on the most vulnerable groups –
women, long-term unemployed and youth. The new Government’s Jobs Strategy being prepared with support
from the World Bank Group will address this concern, as will the Skills Development and Innovation Support
Project.
World Bank’s activities in fYR Macedonia are seen as both pertinent and successful, and participants in the
consultations expressed their appreciation of the knowledge and implementation support provided as part of
World Bank operations, as well as financing. Participants made suggestions for sectors that could be added to the
future World Bank program, such as agriculture. The insufficient use of the IPA funds across all sectors has been
repeatedly underlined by participants, lending support to the Strategy’s cross-cutting theme of EU accession. The
situation is especially serious in the environment sector. Private sector participants identified several areas where
they would welcome greater WBG involvement, including: (1) export promotion, including practical advice to
companies wishing to access export markets; (2) education and skills, including through a stronger link between
the education system and private sector employers; (3) infrastructure, in particular investment in new and better
roads; (4) innovation and quality improvement for better export opportunities; (5) access to finance for SMEs; (6)
strengthening backward linkages/supplier development for FDI; and (7) deeper reforms in business environment,
including a focus on predictable enforcement and implementation of the laws and rules and creating a level
playing field between domestic and foreign investors, and more business-friendly and flexible labor regulations
(e.g. part-time and home based work).

67.
A Client Survey, conducted as part of CPS preparation, finds that the WBG has a
positive image in fYR Macedonia. Respondents praised the pragmatic in-country engagement
in several sectors as well as the relevance of the Bank’s program and its alignment with country
needs. The Bank engagement is seen as particularly relevant in areas such as economic growth,
agriculture and climate change. In contrast, Bank’s achievements in the area of job
creation/employment received one of the lowest scores. With regard to the operations of the
Bank on the ground, opinions are very positive in regards to disbursement and speed of decisionmaking. The Bank is perceived as ‘being a long term partner’ to fYR Macedonia, its
responsiveness and collaboration with the Government and other development partners are
highly valued. Views about Bank’s collaboration with groups outside the government are also
positive but significantly lower than other ratings.
68.
The survey recommends that the Bank should reach out to broader groups outside
main government counterparts, and to make a greater effort to publicize the information that
the Bank produces. Recommendations for future WBG activities focus on growth (with jobs and
broad inclusion) and EU accession, which are seen as top development priorities. Respondents

22

have a positive view of the quality and relevance of the WBG knowledge work, but translation,
dissemination and stakeholder involvement could be improved.
Lessons from recent diagnostic work
69.
The WBG’s strategy in fYR Macedonia is shaped by regular analytic reports as well
as just-in-time analysis and advisory activities. South East Europe Regular Economic Reports
provide a vehicle through which the Bank engages with the authorities and the public on key
economic issues in the country. Dialogue and lending in the area of competitiveness draw on
Making Exports a Catalyst for Economic Growth: An Assessment of fYR Macedonia’s Trade
Competitiveness (2012) and Unlocking Macedonia’s Competitiveness Potential: A Sectoral
Assessment of the Constraints and Opportunities in Automotive, Apparel, Agribusiness, and
Logistic Services (2012), which focused on export sectors and sectors with strong employment
and growth potential, such as agribusiness, automotive, apparel, trade logistics, and tourism.
Binding constraints were identified in the low-value content of the export basket and in
inefficiencies of the factor markets: skills mismatch, labor market flexibility issues, and access to
land for productive investment. The studies informed the choice and design of ongoing and
planned operations on competitiveness, skills and innovation. As part of the Modular
Competitiveness Assessment, the assessment of tourism competitiveness (From World Heritage
to World Destination: Policy Options to Increase the Competitiveness of the Tourism Sector in
fYR Macedonia, 2012) identified the challenges, priorities and strategic directions for
Macedonia’s tourism sector as a key contributor to local economic development. Analysis of the
Agricultural Support Programs (2013) explored options for better allocation of agricultural
subsidies and improved functioning of the agricultural land markets. These topics will inform
further work under the ongoing Public Financial Management Review and Competitiveness DPL
series. Green Growth reports (2013-14) propose "no regret" measures to shift fYR Macedonia’s
growth model onto a greener trajectory, most notably greater energy efficiency and use of
renewable energy, more water storage and efficient use of water, improving climate resilience of
infrastructure and encouraging the use of public transport. These findings underpin recent and
planned WBG operations in energy and transport sectors. Analysis of poverty and inclusion was
carried out as part of the ongoing Western Balkans Programmatic Poverty Assessment technical
assistance as well as the recently completed Special Topic Regular Economic Report First
Insights into Promoting Shared Prosperity in South East Europe (2014). Results of this work
are presented in the analytical part of this Strategy and are informing the country dialogue on
inclusion and skills. The recent Labor Market Assessment (2013), which was carried out as part
the Western Balkan Programmatic Jobs and Labor Markets work in support of a new jobs
strategy for fYR Macedonia, has informed the ongoing country dialogue as well as the design of
the Skills and Innovation Project. Finally, the gender assessment carried out under the Western
Balkans Programmatic Gender Task has contributed to highlighting remaining gender-related
challenges in the country.
B. Translating Country Challenges into World Bank Group Partnership Strategy
70.
The overarching country-level goals of the proposed CPS are reducing poverty and
providing more and better jobs for the people of fYR Macedonia for boosting shared
prosperity. Based on our current understanding of the drivers of shared prosperity in fYR
Macedonia, a tangible shift in this agenda will require faster growth with more job creation.
Two pillars will support these goals: (1) Growth and Competitiveness, and (2) Skills and
23

Inclusion. Competitiveness through investment in crucial infrastructure while generating an
environment that attracts FDI and enables local businesses to thrive will be necessary for putting
fYR Macedonia on a sustainable growth path, creating more and better jobs, and promoting
shared prosperity. It is however unlikely to be sufficient. Policies to improve educational
outcomes and other public services and to remove labor market constraints will be needed to
make sure that a large part of the population reaps the benefits of sustained growth. The WBG
will offer a full range of financial, knowledge and convening services in support of these goals,
providing assistance in several sectors and leveraging Group-wide resources to catalyze impact.
Since fYR Macedonia’s long-term future is clearly linked to European integration, the strategy
will also have a cross-cutting theme of supporting EU accession. No separate operation is
planned in this area; instead, all Bank Group activities will be aligned with the accession agenda
and seek to support it.
71.
The two pillars fit well with the World Bank Group’s strategic goals. Successful
poverty reduction and increased shared prosperity would be hard to achieve without sustained
private sector led growth, and this in turn implies the need to make fYR Macedonia more
attractive as a destination for investment and as a country whose companies can compete
regionally and globally, creating jobs for the people. On the other hand, investment in skills and
ensuring that vulnerable groups have the necessary protection and equal access to economic
opportunities is necessary in order to improve the welfare of the bottom 40 percent of the income
distribution. Strengthening of governance, transparency and accountability across the board will
be needed both to enhance the investment climate and ensure that all citizens can take advantage
of economic opportunities.
72.
Growth with competitiveness, skills and inclusion are also key priorities of the
Government’s vision of development. FYR Macedonia’s key development strategies,
including the Pre-Accession Economic Programme 2014-2016, Government Strategic Priorities
2014-2018, the National Strategy for Reduction of Poverty and Social Exclusion in the Republic
of Macedonia for 2010-2020 and South East Europe 2020 Strategy set out specific targets in
these thematic areas. Bank Group assistance will contribute to attaining these objectives.
73.
The theme of economic governance for EU accession will cut across all World Bank
Group activities in fYR Macedonia. At the strategy level, the proposed CPS is consistent
with the new EU Assistance Country Strategy Paper for 2014-2020, which proposes assistance
in eight areas: governance and public administration reform; justice, home affairs and
fundamental rights; environment; transport; competitiveness and innovation; employment, social
policies and human resources development; agriculture and rural development; and cross-border
and regional cooperation. Competitiveness, jobs and inclusion are therefore also seen as
important for EU accession. The specific targets related to closing the gap with the EU as
defined in the SEE 2020 Strategy will inform the results framework of the CPS and, where
appropriate, of specific operations. At the project level, the WBG will coordinate project design
and implementation with the EU in order to maximize synergies and use the capacity building
opportunities of World Bank-financed operations to support fYR Macedonia’s ability to use IPA
funds more efficiently. Finally, the Bank will explore opportunities for joint projects with the
EU and other development partners in order to minimize transaction costs and increase the
impact of combined resources available to fYR Macedonia.

24

Figure 6: FYR Macedonia CPS FY2015-18: Results Framework

Pillar 1: Growth and Competitiveness
Challenge: Job creation through faster growth and better competitiveness
Fiscal and public financial management
74.
As described in the diagnostic section of this document, reliance on public
investment to drive growth in fYR Macedonia puts special emphasis on the quality and
efficiency of public financial management. FYR Macedonia has both the capacity and track
record of prudent macroeconomic management, which has been a key ingredient in the country’s
past growth. Continued macro sustainability will require continuous improvements in fiscal and
public financial management. The Government has announced a program of fiscal
consolidation and plans to stabilize central government debt, which are essential for the mediumterm stability and which imply a gradual reduction in the level of fiscal deficit. Fulfilling these
plans will be challenging in light of the large ongoing and planned public investment program.
Greater public transparency, and in particular publication of quarterly reports on public and
publicly guaranteed debt can help maintain the resolve behind fiscal consolidation effort as well
25

as build trust for new private investment. Strengthening governance and transparency will also
be critical for fYR Macedonia’s EU accession dialogue. The Bank will contribute to this agenda
through the ongoing PFR as well as through Development Policy Lending based on the findings
and recommendations of that review. Through its engagement with the Public Enterprise for
State Roads, the Bank will also continue to support capacity for evidence-based investment
decisions in the largest public investment program. The WBG will also encourage and support
the Government in attracting more private sector investments in infrastructure sectors, as a way
of reducing the burden on the budget.
Outcome 1: Improved fiscal and public financial management
Proposed WBG program: Public Finance Review; Regional and Local Roads Project (ongoing); Public
Finance DPL; National and Regional Road Rehabilitation Project; Road Upgrading Project; Growth and
Shared Prosperity Diagnostic (planned).

Export, competitiveness and private investment
75.
Further improvements in the business climate, attracting private investment and
improved export potential are essential in order to achieve sustained private sector led
growth and job creation. As described in the diagnostic section, fYR Macedonia has made
important strides in this area already – the country has been recognized as one of the top ten
reformers globally in the latest Doing Business Report – but many challenges remain, especially
in terms of effective implementation of reforms and further capacity building that would be
translated into higher investment and more and better jobs for the Macedonian population.
Access to finance for SMEs and implementation of local business-related regulation (for
example, issuing construction permits) are among key doing business concerns that companies
cite. IFC and the World Bank will continue supporting this agenda through a series of knowledge
and financing activities, including just-in-time advisory and technical assistance and lending.
IFC will focus on making more financing available to SMEs through credit lines with
commercial banks. It is important to note that access to finance is as much a question of
effective demand by SMEs as it is a question of liquidity, and the Bank will help address this
demand-side challenge through its work on local business sophistication and skills as part of the
ongoing fYR Macedonia Competitive Industries and Innovation Support Program and
Development Policy Lending. In the short run however this means that IFC’s financing may be
limited by lack of viable credit demand, excess liquidity in commercial banks and often their
cheap parent funding, as well as the availability of subsidized funding and grants provided by
other IFIs especially on renewable energy, energy efficiency and SME segments, which further
distorts the market. IFC is also considering engagement with non-performing loans (NPL)
workouts by helping banks to strengthen capital and offload NPLs, depending on the country’s
appetite for these market solutions. MIGA will provide guarantees to foreign parent banks to
increase the availability of resources to their Macedonian subsidiaries31. There are also
promising trends in FDI flows to fYR Macedonia, yet the country’s ability to extract full growth
31

MIGA has two active guarantees aimed to improve the capacity of Macedonian subsidiaries of foreign banks to
provide credits to local businesses. The first of these is the guarantee to ProCredit Holding (Germany) in the amount
of US$12.5 million approved in December 2010 and valid for ten years. The second was approved in March 2014
and covers €104.5 million (US$143.9 million equivalent) of investments by the National Bank of Greece into its
Macedonian subsidiary, Stopanska Banka.

26

and employment potential of these is limited by the level of local business sophistication and
innovation, which reduces backward linkages between FDI and the local economy. IFC will
look for opportunities to attract and support FDIs and through them to help the country become
more competitive and increase the technological intensity of its exports. IFC will also continue
to support business environment in fYR Macedonia through the Westerns Balkans regional
advisory services platforms in the areas of trade logistics, corporate governance and food safety.
The recently approved Skills and Innovation Project will provide incentives for commercial
innovation activities through the Innovation Fund, which is starting operations in 2014.
Outcome 2: Better conditions for private investment and links to FDI
Proposed WBG program: IFC investments (ongoing and planned); MIGA guarantees (ongoing and
planned); TA on competitiveness (ongoing); Competitiveness DPL3; Growth and Shared Prosperity
Diagnostic (planned).

Infrastructure - Roads
76.
Better road infrastructure is key to overcoming the disadvantages of a small
landlocked economy and is the Government’s top priority. As discussed above, the quality
of fYR Macedonia’s roads has been deteriorating relative to its neighbors: once a regional leader
with respect to road quality, it now has the second lowest road quality among the South East
Europe (SEE) countries. The Government has an ambitious program of investments in the
sector, and World Bank involvement in the design and implementation of this program can not
only bring the needed financial resources but also strengthen its quality, including in areas such
as road safety, climate resilience and improved capacity for evidence-based investment choices.
In the transport sector, the World Bank will provide implementation support to the Local and
Regional Roads Project and prepare two further operations to support road rehabilitation and
upgrading. A key component of this work will be continued improvement of the financial
viability and public resource management in the transport sector. Depending on the level of the
Government's interest and commitment, IFC will provide advisory services to the Public
Enterprise for State Roads, possibly supporting Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in the
sector. If conditions allow for other PPPs in the infrastructure sectors, IFC stands ready to
support the country with advisory and financing of high-impact projects that can make
significant contributions to growth and employment.
77.
Through its engagement in the road sector of fYR Macedonia, the Bank is helping
the Government to integrate road safety considerations into the entire program through
binding infrastructure safety management measures for contractors and road authorities in all
stages of planning and execution; improving security standards on road-railways crossings;
eliminating black spots; efficient road maintenance; and ensuring visibility on the roads by
eliminating physical obstacles. Additionally, to ensure a focus on road safety in the management
of the road network the Bank is working with PESR on introducing road safety impact
assessments, road safety audits, network safety management and safety inspections by competent
authorities. The Bank will also work with the Government on a Road Safety Management
Capacity Review to identify recommendations for all institutions to improve the discharge of
their responsibilities in road safety.

27

78.
Gender and inclusion aspects will be mainstreamed into transport investment
through a focus on: (1) ensuring equal participation of men and women in decision-making
process, (2) providing equal access to economic opportunities, and (3) measuring impact on
specific groups. Poverty and Social Impact Analysis will be conducted to assess the poverty and
inclusion impact of road rehabilitation activities and to build government capacity to streamline
poverty reduction consideration into investment planning. This analysis will assess the
distributional effect of improved road connectivity on the affected population with a particular
focus on women as one of the vulnerable groups. Equal employment opportunities in road
construction will be promoted by raising gender awareness of construction companies.
Improvement of the condition of the selected regional roads will improve public transport service
and increase connectivity between urban and rural areas, thus improving access to jobs and
markets for the less well-off. As women typically use public transport to a greater extent than
men, it is expected that road rehabilitation activities are especially beneficial to women.
Outcome 3: Road infrastructure management improved
Proposed WBG program: Regional and Local Roads (ongoing), Regional Roads Rehabilitation
(planned), Road Upgrading (planned); Upgrade to Regional Balkans Transport Infrastructure Study
(REBIS) (planned); IFC advisory on PPP (planned).

Infrastructure – Energy
79.
FYR Macedonia is facing a challenge of ensuring adequate energy supply for
growth. The country ranks among the most energy-intensive economies in the Balkans due to a
combination of energy-intensive local industries (iron and steel, ore extraction, cement), poorly
insulated buildings, inefficient electrical appliances in households and large distribution losses.
The entire supply of oil, petroleum products and natural gas is imported. Analytic work carried
out by the World Bank in close collaboration with the Government has demonstrated that
investments in energy efficiency are the most cost-effective way towards energy security. In
addition, as lignite deposits are being exhausted, the country should capitalize on its hydro
potential, which should also help with the need to increase water storage capacity in the face of
the growing drought risk. The ongoing Energy Adaptable Program Loan (APL) 3 Project will
improve fYR Macedonia’s connection to the regional network while new lending will focus on
enhancing new renewable energy capacity (possible investment in small hydropower station) and
improving energy efficiency (Energy Efficiency Fund Project). IFC will continue the
implementation of its regional Balkans Renewable Energy Program (BREP) in fYR
Macedonia32, supporting the country at regulatory, firm and financial institution level, to increase
its renewable energy production. BREP will be implemented through joint Bank and IFC
32

BREP advisory program, active in Macedonia since 2011, aims to develop renewable energy market with a
special emphasis on small hydropower plants (SHPP) in Western Balkan countries with the highest impact potential.
The Program, supported by the Ministry of Finance of Austria, provides advisory services to regulatory authorities,
renewable energy sponsors and local financial institutions. BREP's key objectives are (i) to improve the existing
framework related to renewable energy (RE); (ii) support individual RE investors and (iii) support local banks to
improve capacity in project finance and RE technologies. More specifically, BREP is providing technical assistance
to the Macedonian Ministry of Economy and Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning on regulation and
investment promotion in the RE sector. As a result, the Government is in the process of bundling of SHPP sites to
make them more attractive to investors, revising the FiT price for SHPPs (incentivizing smaller sites), and revising
the Grid Distribution Code (to enhance SHPP’s connection to the distribution grid).

28

interventions as well as in strong coordination with other stakeholders in the country. IFC is
planning through its advisory and financial services to the private sector to stimulate the creation
of additional 100MW of renewable energy capacity by the end of the CPS period. MIGA will
also explore possibilities of support to public energy enterprises in attracting additional external
investments.
Outcome 4: More clean energy available
Proposed WBG program: Energy APL3 (ongoing); Energy Efficiency Fund, Small hydropower station,
Biomass-based Heating Study, Municipal Energy Efficiency Promotion (planned); IFC advisory (ongoing
and planned), possible MIGA guarantee.

Pillar 2: Skills and Inclusion
Challenge: Opportunities for all through modern skills and better public services
80.
This pillar is focused on interventions that would help broader sections of society to
participate in the fruits of economic growth through better employability and more efficient
public and municipal services.
Employment access and skills
81.
Education and skills have been identified among critical constraints to employability.
While access to education has improved, there is a challenging disconnect between education
system outcomes and the private sector needs, as companies complain about the quality and
availability of skills despite high unemployment. Lack of a clear accreditation mechanism
means that employers do not know which skills a university graduate should possess, making
hiring harder. Graduates of secondary vocational schools often have had no practical exposure
to the job for which they are trained. Providing workers with the skills demanded in the labor
market is central to inclusive growth since skills are the main asset workers have to improve their
productivity, earn higher wages and lift their households out of poverty and into the middle class.
While the skills agenda is broad and involves all levels of education, the Government has asked
the Bank to focus on adapting the post-primary education system to the needs of the labor
market. The World Bank will support this crucial agenda through the recently approved Skills
and Innovation Project, which aims to improve the links between tertiary and secondary VET
education institutions and potential employers for its graduates, enforce the focus on
competencies and skills relevant for job market.
Outcome 5: Tertiary and VET education system more focused on skills for labor market
Proposed WBG program: Skills and Innovation Project (ongoing).

Protecting the vulnerable
82.
Improving the efficiency and coverage of the social protection system while
providing more opportunities to the vulnerable groups is an important part of the inclusion
agenda. Targeting and efficiency of the social safety net can be strengthened, making it faster
and cheaper to administer and at the same time ensuring that more people eligible for support
receive it. In particular, as discussed in the diagnostic section of the strategy, there is room to

29

focus assistance on the poorest quintile, as well as to ensure that more of those who are eligible
for programs such as CCT are registered for the benefit. Another challenge is to make social
assistance compatible with incentives to seek a job, which could help people exit from the
system and improve their welfare in a sustained way. The WBG will support this agenda
through ongoing and new operations and knowledge work. The Conditional Cash Transfer
(CCT) Project supports employment opportunities for the families in the bottom 40 percent of
the population, and helps improve the coverage and targeting of social assistance to the bottom
income quintile. Special emphasis is made on the empowerment of women: impact evaluation of
the CCT secondary education program reveals that nominating women as the recipients of public
transfers can improve the pattern of expenditures in the household. As of 2014/15 school year
the transfers will be paid to the mothers in all beneficiary households. The new ICT-based Jobs
Project will pilot mechanisms of employment for different population groups through ICT
platforms, focusing on women, youth, disabled and other groups that are facing particular
challenges in finding regular employment. The project will also improve inter-connectivity
among government agencies, raising the efficiency of social assistance administration and other
public services. Lessons learned from the pilot may be scaled up in a future operation.
Resources available under the new CPS leave room for additional operations in this area, e.g.
focused on a more comprehensive reform of the social protection system, subject to discussions
with the Government during CPS implementation.
Outcome 6: Social protection system more efficient and compatible with employment
Proposed WBG program: CCT Project, Employment and Job Creation in fYR Macedonia (ongoing);
ICT-based Jobs, Meeting the Jobs Challenges in the Western Balkans (planned); Social Protection
operation (possible33).

Closing the gap on basic services
83.
Improved access to basic and municipal services is an important part of the inclusion
agenda in fYR Macedonia, particularly in the rural areas where the poor and bottom 40 percent
are overrepresented. The Bank with support from the European Commission will scale up the
geographic coverage of the ongoing Municipal Services Project, reaching poorer rural
municipalities and providing not only crucial local infrastructure investment, such as piped water
connections and solid waste services, but also strengthening the capacity of municipalities to
prioritize, plan and implement such investments. IFC will support PPP investments in local
infrastructure.
Outcome 7: Access to basic and municipal services enhanced
Proposed WBG program: Municipal Services Project (ongoing).

C. Implementing the FY15-18 Country Partnership Strategy
84.
The strategy will be implemented in close collaboration across the WBG and with
development partners. After two years of implementation, a midterm review will be held to
assess progress and make necessary course corrections.
85.
The Bank will apply a social filter to its entire pipeline to help task teams in the
country address obstacles that limit poverty reduction and shared prosperity for specific groups
(women, minorities, in particular Roma, etc.) and to design activities and policy reforms that
promote a more inclusive and cohesive society. Social filter activity will include (a) a rapid
analysis of social issues in fYR Macedonia, (b) a practical tool that can help task teams identify
how their projects address key social issues, and (c) support to project teams in the design and
implementation of activities that can promote greater social inclusion and sustainability.
Financing and instruments
86.
The new CPS will make available to fYR Macedonia up to US$400 million in new
lending for the four years of strategy implementation, subject to IBRD lending capacity,
demand from other borrowers, country performance and priorities, and global economic
developments. Depending on the market conditions, this could be supplemented by IFC
financing of US$80-100 million for four years and possibly also MIGA guarantees.
87.
Leveraging all parts of the WBG balance sheet (IBRD, IFC and MIGA) could help
maximize the amount of financial resources available to the country. It is important to note
however that as a middle income country fYR Macedonia has access to a variety of concessional
and commercial funding options, and the decision on how much to borrow will also need to be
balanced with the strategy of fiscal consolidation that the Government is pursuing. As such, the
actual lending volume may be considerably lower than US$400 million depending on the client’s
needs and availability of viable projects that fit within the parameters of the strategy.
Partnerships and Donor Coordination
88.
The World Bank continues to play an active role in donor coordination to improve
complementarity and impact of its assistance. In recent years donor engagement in fYR
Macedonia and the amount of grant assistance available to the country have decreased. This
trend is partially a result of the increased EU grant financing through the Instrument for PreAccession Assistance (IPA). Aside from the EU, other donors include the United States Agency
for International Development (USAID), Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and
the United Nations. On the lending side, the country has intensified cooperation with the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the European Investment Bank
(EIB), and the Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB). The World Bank has a close
working relationship with all donors and lending partners to ensure complementarity of projects
and advisory services to jointly reinforce the EU accession process.
89.
Partnership with donors established during the previous CPS period will be
maintained in the future. Cooperation with EBRD will continue in the new CPS with parallel
financing discussed for the national roads rehabilitation program. Close cooperation with UN
agencies, namely UNDP and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR),

32

will focus on the green growth and human resources agenda. Cooperation with USAID will
focus on energy efficiency and on implementing selected recommendations from the green
growth advisory services provided to the Government.
90.
Considering the country’s goal to accede to the EU, Bank projects will continue to
emphasize EU acquis requirements in policy dialogue and operations. EU accession guides
legislative and policy developments, as reform of legislation in line with the acquis is the
country’s priority. The Bank will continue to take the acquis requirements into consideration in
its policy dialogue with the Government and to provide technical assistance in the reform
process.
91.
The Bank will continue working with the Government and the EC to identify
appropriate modalities of cooperation between the EU and the Bank and help the
Government improve IPA absorption. Pre-accession assistance is the largest financial
assistance to the country, with an annual envelope of approximately EUR100 million in IPA
grants available to all levels of government, private sector and civil society, to finance legislation
modernization, capacity building and infrastructure investments under the 2007-2013
programing period. However absorption of the EU funds is slow: only about 35 percent of IPA
resources available for 2007-2013 have been committed as of May 2014.
92.
Recently the partnership between the EU and the Bank has evolved, moving from
regular coordination on strategic issues and parallel financing to joint financing of
investment projects and advisory services. The first such operation, which is at an advanced
stage of discussion, involves the additional grant financing provided to the Municipal Services
Improvement Project (MSIP) in the amount of EUR15.5 million from IPA, expected to be
approved in 2014. Discussions are ongoing about collaboration in other areas, such as local
competitiveness and tourism. The World Bank will continue to support the Government in the
strategic planning and project preparations for IPA2 financing and to work toward establishing
co-financing arrangements under IPA2.
Monitoring and Evaluation
93.
The results framework for the new strategy is focused on 7 CPS outcomes that the
program seeks to influence. Progress towards these outcomes will be monitored through the
specific outcome indicators that include both final and intermediate targets. An annual Country
Performance and Results Review (CPRR) will be held to monitor progress on the results
framework, and a midterm review exercise will also be held with the client.
94.
Monitoring of the following indicators will be disaggregated by gender: share of
Social Financial Assistance beneficiaries with children ages 15-18 registered for conditional cash
transfers; and share of recipients of social assistance who work formally.
IV. MANAGING RISKS TO BANK PROGRAM
95.
At the country level, the new CPS faces several important risks that were described in
the Medium-Term Outlook and Risks section above. The Bank will adjust its program should
any of them materialize. In particular, in the case of an external shock or a major natural disaster

33

the WBG may change the volume or composition of financial support in response to changing
financing needs, for example increase the volume of resources made available as DPLs, subject
to available financial capacity, debt sustainability and policy reform requirements. If the
Government’s fiscal consolidation efforts are unsuccessful and fYR Macedonia’s public debt,
moderate at present, reaches unsustainable levels, the Bank may reduce the volume of new
lending and refrain from offering DPLs. The Bank will also remain vigilant to the risk of civil
and ethnic unrest and move to adjust its program as appropriate.
96.
With respect to the proposed program of WBG operations and their expected
results, based on the experience to date the main risk is that of implementation delay, for reasons
of budget constraints and capacity limitations. Overall the risk of not achieving the planned
results during the timeframe of the new strategy is assessed as low to moderate. Some of the
specific risks include:
 Change in political priorities: While the current strategy is based on a clear request
from the client and has been shaped in the process of extensive consultations, it is possible
that priorities may change during the four years of the new CPS implementation. The Bank
team will use the strategy as a living document and engage in regular progress and results
reviews so as to adjust the course as needed.
 Resistance to high profile operations: High profile infrastructure operations, even if
impeccable from a technical and economic perspective, may meet with resistance from some
groups. The World Bank’s policies, such as social and environmental safeguards, the social
filter and proactive public communication campaigns will be used to mitigate these risks.
 Capacity constraints delay or complicate implementation: While fYR Macedonia has
a strong track record of project implementation in many sectors, some capacity constraints
remain. World Bank will continue to provide technical assistance and implementation
support to all implementing agencies.
 Data constraints: Reliable data are scarce on many aspects of poverty and shared
prosperity. In particular, fYR Macedonia has not had a census since 2002 and a declining
response rate on the HSB makes it difficult to monitor long-term changes in poverty and
shared prosperity indicators and reduces the availability of data for evidence-based policymaking. The Bank will use the Survey on Income and Living Conditions, initiated in 2010
by the State Statistical Office for monitoring welfare, to inform the engagement through
poverty and shared prosperity analyses. In addition, the Bank will continue providing
technical assistance to the State Statistical Office and look for opportunities to strengthen
data collection and analysis.

FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA
COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FY11–14 COMPLETION REPORT

INTRODUCTION
1.
This Country Partnership Strategy Completion Report (CPSCR) reviews the experience of
implementing the FY11–14 World Bank Group Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for the Former
Yugoslav Republic (fYR) of Macedonia (Report No. 54928-MK, September 20, 2010). The document
assesses the effectiveness of the Bank Group’s strategy in: (i) aligning its objectives with fYR
Macedonia’s long term strategic goals; (ii) setting relevant, measurable and realistic CPS outcomes; and
(iii) achieving its expected outcomes in an efficient and sustainable way. In addition to discussions with
the country team and Government counterparts, this assessment is based on reference documents such as
the CPS, Project Appraisal Documents, Implementation Status Reports, supervision reports, and reports
related to Economic and Sector Work. The findings of the assessment have informed the preparation of
the FY15-FY18 CPS.
2.
During the period of the strategy the Government of fYR Macedonia has been pursuing a
development strategy focused on the following five objectives: (i) economic growth and private
sector development; (ii) integration into the EU; (iii) fight against corruption and economic
crime; (iv) good interethnic relations; and (v) investments in education, science and knowledgebased society. The CPS was well aligned with and has contributed to the progress towards
objectives one, two and five.
3.
During the CPS period the World Bank delivered US$534.4 million in new loans, of
which US$98 million was Investment Project Financing, US$100 million budget support and
US$336.4 million Policy Based Guarantees. IFC invested US$63.3 million: US$23.7 million in
the financial sector, US$35 million in manufacturing and US$4.6 million in energy.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS AND RATINGS

4.
The objective of the FY11-14 CPS was to support faster, more inclusive and greener growth
while helping to prepare for EU accession. The CPS focused Bank Group support in three areas of
engagement: (i) faster growth – competitiveness; (ii) more inclusive growth – employability and social
protection; and (iii) greener growth - environmental sustainability and climate action. In these three areas
of engagement, the CPS contributed to specific development outcomes which are summarized in Table 1.
38

Annex 2
During the first half of the CPS, contributions to these outcomes came mainly from interventions carried
forward from the FY07-10 CPS. Tables 2, 2a and 3 provide a breakdown of planned and actual operations
and knowledge and advisory activities for the FY11-14 CPS respectively.
5.
The Competitiveness Pillar is rated Satisfactory. The program has made outstanding
development contributions, particularly in Competitiveness. The WBG has accomplished highly
successful interventions in maintaining macroeconomic and fiscal stability and strengthening municipal
services and infrastructure. Some fiscal issues remain, but the Bank’s timely intervention was vital to
maintaining macroeconomic stability.
6.
The Inclusiveness Pillar that embodied the WBG’s strategic goals of fighting poverty and
achieving more inclusive growth is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. The lack of reliable data on
incomes and household budgets made it impossible to monitor the targeting of the social safety net and to
properly evaluate some program outcomes. The conditions for employment of vulnerable groups were
improved, but on the whole the WB team did not sufficiently mitigate the difficulties of achieving
program goals and measuring program impact in this area. On the other hand, the Conditional Cash
Transfer project, aimed at improving the efficiency of social safety nets, was the first of its kind to be
implemented in the region.
7.
The Greener Growth Pillar is rated Satisfactory. For the first time in fYR Macedonia, the
World Bank successfully engaged with the Government in the area of energy efficiency. Completed
activities have demonstrated to the Government the potential of investments in this area, leading to the
formulation of the first National Program of Energy Efficiency in Public Buildings and a decision to
establish a revolving Energy Efficiency Fund to implement this program. The Bank and Government
underestimated the complexity of some infrastructure projects involving land acquisition, and there have
been implementation delays, despite which the projects are on track to achieve expected outcomes. Highlevel policy dialogue on the use of state-owned agricultural lands has led to commitment to land
privatization embodied in law.
8.
The CPS was weighed towards the Competitiveness and Greener Growth Pillars (13 and 10
outcome clusters respectively) and had fewer outcomes under the Inclusiveness Pillar (2 outcome
clusters). Out of 25 outcome clusters 16 were Achieved, a further eight were Mostly Achieved, and one
Partially Achieved. Overall FY11-14 CPS performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. This rating
reflects the strategic importance of the Inclusiveness Pillar which had a relatively lower percentage of
fully achieved outcomes than the others.

II.

PROGRESS TOWARD ACHIEVING COUNTRY-LEVEL GOALS

9.
The CPS was aligned with and contributed to the progress toward three objectives of the
Government of fYR Macedonia: economic growth and private sector development, integration into the
EU, and investments in education, science and knowledge-based society.
Economic Growth and Private Sector Development
10.
Macroeconomic and financial stability was preserved in the face of significant negative
shocks. fYR Macedonia achieved moderate growth during the ongoing Eurozone crisis, to which as a
land-locked and trade-dependent economy it was particularly vulnerable. Average GDP growth between
2009 and 2013 was 2.1 percent per year, slightly better than its South East European neighbors’ 1.7
percent. Central Government debt was maintained below 40 percent of GDP through 2013, and spending
on pensions below 9 percent of GDP up to 2012. In 2013 the World Bank supported the Government with
the second Public Expenditure Policy Based Guarantee (PEPBG) thus helping it obtain a large
39

Annex 2
commercial loan, which allowed for the fast repayment of arrears and implementation of measures to
prevent their reoccurrence. The level of public health arrears was successfully controlled for part of the
period, but the goal to maintain them at or below 0.2 percent of GDP was not achieved. Successful PFM
reforms supported under PBG2 were key for maintaining macroeconomic stability.
11.
The PBG allowed the country to obtain access to the international bank loan market on
improved terms. The Government used the PEPBG to borrow €250 million in January 2013, covering 46
percent of the total 2013 financing requirement at a reasonable cost (3.915 percent interest rate) in two
tranches of 5 and 7 years maturity. The PEPBG also helped leverage the Bank’s capital by allowing fYR
Macedonia to contract a commercial loan of €250 million out of which IBRD guaranteed 62 percent, or
€155 million (US$201.5 million equivalent).
12.
The business climate in fYR Macedonia has consistently improved. Reforms to registration
and permitting processes, property registration procedures, investor protection, and tax collection were
carried out. In 2013, Doing Business ranked fYR Macedonia the fifth most improved country among the
top 50 economies in the world; it had jumped from 92nd position in 2006 to 25th in 2013, outstripping
peer countries in the region. The efficiency of judiciary services has improved considerably, with the
number of days required to enforce a contract down from 370 to 60. Further, SMEs’ access to financing in
key growth sectors was enhanced.
13.
The DPL actions supported FDI inflows into medium- and high-tech manufacturing
industries, generating significant new employment, however challenges remain. FYR Macedonia has
the potential for a diversified economy and for significant investments and exports, including, inter alia,
automotive components, healthcare products and pharmaceuticals, agribusiness and food processing, and
metals and metal products. The Government's FDI attraction strategy, based on promotion, special
economic zones (SEZ) and investor incentives packages, has resulted in inflows of high value added FDI
and significant new employment. These investments jumped to €78 million in 2013, accounting for net
exports of €87 million in 2013, and are expected to be up to €190 million in 2014, with total exports of
€1.2 billion. The companies employed around 5,000 workers in 2013, a figure expected to increase to
9,000 by the end of 2014. The authority of the institutions and the monitoring and audit system for fiscal
incentives have been strengthened through the Competitiveness DPL, and support has been extended to
exporter support programs and investment programs in new zones based on market demand. Nonetheless,
and though it has supported a specialized agency entitled Invest in Macedonia to attract FDI to these and
other sectors, capital inflows remain below expectations.
16.
While efficiency and transparency of land administration have improved, unleashing longterm agricultural growth and thereby reducing rural poverty requires further reforms. Real estate
transactions grew 29 percent on 2009 and registered mortgages using property as collateral between 2009
and 2012 jumped by 64 percent. The agribusiness sector has seen a large increase in public spending,
from €10 million in 2005 to €130 million in 2013. Most of this increase was allocated to direct farm
subsidies. While these subsidies can help spur short-term growth, they do not address structural
inefficiencies dragging down agricultural profitability and make it even more difficult to pursue reforms
necessary to unleash long-term agricultural growth. Rural poverty remains rooted in low agricultural
productivity. The sector remains penalized by the absence of a fluid land rental market, high farm
fragmentation, inadequate financing for applied agricultural research and farm advisory services, and the
slow resolution of institutional problems around water use associations.
19.
In trade logistics, the Government is modernizing transport infrastructure to speed the flow
of passenger and cargo traffic, while simultaneously introducing trade facilitation measures. The
largest airports were recently upgraded through a concession with a private operator from Turkey, and the
Government has initiated investments to upgrade Corridor X, its main road and rail corridor to EU
40

Annex 2
markets and ports. Investment plans to upgrade Corridor VIII and local roads are also underway.
Facilitation measures include simplified customs procedures and strengthened coordination with
inspection agencies; introduction of a single-window system for processing export/import and transport
licenses; introduction of a risk-based approach to customs controls and technical inspections, combined
with more inspectors at major border crossings, to speed processing; and systematizing professional
standards and internal controls to mitigate corruption among customs officers.
20.
To boost competitiveness and reduce unemployment – while on a downward trend, at 28.7
percent in the third quarter of 2013, it remains one of the highest in Europe – the Government has
lowered the cost to businesses of employing workers by reducing the tax burden. Legal reforms
supported under the DPLs were enacted to address rigidity in labor market regulations, facilitate seasonal
employment and improve public sector capacity and the regulatory framework to nurture private sector
innovation.
Integration into the EU
21.
EU standards have informed the reforms, consistent with Government’s priority. For
example, according to the EC Progress Report 2014, progress in the area of corporate and financial
reporting, with Bank support through financial sector TA and regional REPARIS, was satisfactory. Going
beyond set country-level goals, the cadastre agency adopted a National Spatial Data Infrastructure
Strategy in line with EU requirements. The IPARD-accredited Paying Agency is fully functional. Farm
registry and land parcel identification systems are established, and quarterly reports on key agricultural
data are published.
Investments in Education, Science and Knowledge-Based Society
22.
Increasing innovation capacity is a priority for Government, and a central part of the
strategy to accelerate productivity growth and diversify exports. The Government has taken
important steps towards strengthening the innovation policy framework by adopting an Innovation
Strategy in October 2012 and enacting a Law on Innovation Activity in May 2013. The Law enabled the
establishment of a Fund for Innovation and Technological Development that will introduce competitive
financial instruments to stimulate commercial R&D, support new start-ups and spin-offs, and scale up
technology commercialization and transfer activities, thus connecting the research sector to private sector
and market needs.
23.
Higher education reform has commenced, aimed at bringing it in line with EU standards
and making graduates’ skills more market-relevant. The legislative framework on quality assurance in
higher education system was amended to align it with EU standards, and a higher education funding
model has been defined.

III.

EVALUATION OF PROGRAM PERFORMANCE

Pillar I. Faster Growth by Improving Competitiveness

24.
Adverse economic conditions notwithstanding, key macroeconomic stability outcomes were
achieved. FYR Macedonia, like many countries in ECA, confronts an economic and financial
environment far more challenging than existed prior to the 2008-2009 crisis. With ECA the worst hit of
all developing and transition regions, fYR Macedonia’s primary trade and financial partners showed tepid
41

Annex 2
growth over the short-term. Capital was scarce and imports sluggish. The WBG engaged closely with the
authorities to identify where it could provide support to improve macroeconomic stability. The PBGs
helped consolidate macroeconomic stability by supporting measures to maintain sustainable debt levels,
furthering reforms to the pension system, and strengthening the health financing system through
implementing centralized international procurement and adoption of the bylaw establishing the Medical
Network. The PBGs strengthened the resilience of the financial sector by supporting adoption of a new
law to strengthen the independence and accountability of the Central Bank, while at the same time
improving coordination between the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance and establishing a
Supervisory Committee to increase the supervisory capacity of relevant bodies. The second PBG allowed
the Government to obtain, on favorable terms, a large commercial loan for the repayment of arrears and
implement measures to prevent their reoccurrence. Although health sector reforms rationalized spending
by healthcare institutions and PBG health sector outcomes were achieved, public health arrears have
remained above the projected level.
25.
The CPS contributed to strengthening competitiveness and improving the business
environment, through investment in enterprise development, FDI and exports, land administration,
judicial services, access to finance, land, and skills development. The FY05 Business Environment
Reform and Institutional Strengthening (BERIS) Project, completed in FY11, contributed to improving
the regulatory regime and institutional framework for business entry and activity. It strengthened capacity
in a number of key areas including improving access to information on credit through a credit registry and
business entry through a one-stop shop for company registration. The results contributed to fYR
Macedonia's meeting EU criteria on the Free Movement of Goods, Company Law, and Industrial and
Enterprise Policy.
26.
Policy shifts created or strengthened the enabling environment for innovation and R&D
support. The 2013 establishment of the Fund for Innovation and Technological Development, supported
by the FY14 Skills and Innovation Project, evolved from the Innovation Strategy (2012) and Law on
Innovation Activity (2013) and development of financing instruments to stimulate private sector
innovation through the Fund. The State Statistical Office introduced a new survey instrument measuring
innovative activity of enterprises based on international methodology, which was first supported by the
BERIS Project in 2010.
27.
The FY05 Real Estate Cadastre project has been supporting the development of an efficient
and effective real estate cadastre and registration system, with a view to developing land and real
estate markets. With the exception of the slight fall in customer satisfaction with cadastre services, all
land administration outcomes were achieved. Additional financing for the Real Estate Cadastre project
approved in FY10 supported the digitization and vectorization of cadastre maps that facilitated data
sharing among public, private, and Government institutions, upgraded the national geodetic reference
infrastructure, and supported the development of national spatial data infrastructure in line with the EU's
INSPIRE Directive. The project also built the capacity of the Authority of Legal and Property Affairs,
which oversees property and legal issues involving public authorities and agencies.
28.
The improvement of judiciary services outcome was achieved, with the efficiency and
effectiveness of judicial services improved and access to justice strengthened. The FY06 Legal and
Judicial Implementation project, which closed in 2011, strengthened judicial institutions; supported
implementation of new bankruptcy legislation; developed a framework for administrative disputes by
improving judicial management; and invested in court infrastructure, such as constructing and
rehabilitating courthouses and enhancing judicial information technology systems. IFC contributed
through its Alternative Dispute Resolution Project, which promoted the use of mediation as an alternative
to court proceedings.

42

Annex 2
29.
The strengthening of higher education outcome was mostly achieved. World Bank TA
supported the Ministry of Education and Science in making informed policy choices about financing
higher education, including establishing bodies for external quality assurance in accordance with good
practice and European agreements and guidelines. This project demonstrated how investment lending in
can support implementation of agreed policy changes.
30.
FDI attraction and SME development outcomes were achieved. The WBG devoted
considerable attention to the competitiveness agenda through the DPO series, underpinned by the
Modular Competitiveness Assessment AAA, supporting the Government's program to improve
competitiveness of the economy. Reforms created incentives for investment and technology upgrading in
manufacturing, agribusiness and trade logistics. In parallel, policy actions laid the groundwork for
increasing labor market flexibility and developing job-relevant skills.
31.
IFC continued to assist private companies to improve their access to finance and increase
their exports, and to offer to the central and local Governments its PPP advisory services in
different areas. In coordination with the Bank, through its ongoing Trade Logistic advisory program,
IFC helped the country to reduce trade constraints, harmonize border clearance through regional
cooperation, and facilitate further liberalization of trade and alignment of rules on EU practices linked to
the CEFTA regional trade agenda. Through its International Standards and Technical Regulations
advisory program, IFC has contributed to increased corporate sales revenues by $15 million and exports
by over US$3.5 million. IFC contributed to a better corporate governance culture working with key
regulatory and market institutions. As a result, 23 companies improved their performance and 4
companies reported an increase of $30 million in investments as a result of improved corporate
governance practices.
32.
Under the Global Trade Finance Program, IFC extended $10.3 million in trade credit lines
to three banks in fYR Macedonia. IFC’s financing helped these banks to provide additional financing to
small and medium enterprises operating in key import and export sectors such as energy, metallurgy,
mining, textile, food processing, and transport. When international financing was becoming harder to
obtain due to the European economic crisis, IFC financed a subsidiary of a European bank with $13.4
million to support expansion of lending to SMEs, agribusiness, infrastructure, and climate change. In
addition, IFC invested $70 million in a cement group, of which half is expected to be invested in the
group's Macedonian subsidiary.
33.
The roads rehabilitation outcome has been mostly achieved. The FY08 Regional and Local
Roads Program Support Project, due to close in 2015, built the capacity of the Public Enterprise for State
Roads (PESR) and invested in the rehabilitation of the regional and local road network, with a view to
improving the access of isolated communities to markets. To date, all planned regional roads (284 km)
have been rehabilitated, and work on local roads continues as planned; it should result in the rehabilitation
of a further 420 km of roads and lead to vehicle operation costs reduction. IFC has been assisting the
Government to structure a PPP transaction and attract a private concessionaire for expansion, operation
and maintenance of the motorway between Skopje and Kicevo. A Road Asset Management System
enabling evidence-based planning of further infrastructure development is being put in place.
34.
The facilitation of regional trade outcome has been achieved. The FY07 Second Trade and
Transport Facilitation project (closed in FY11), lowered transport and freight costs, particularly by
improving border crossing facilities, upgrading a road corridor section to motorway standards, and
harmonizing and improving telecommunications and cargo data exchange between railways and customs.
Freight processing times have been reduced and non-tariff trade obstacles removed between fYR
Macedonia and its neighbors.

43

Annex 2
35.
All annual targets for municipal services have been achieved and are ahead of schedule to
achieve outcomes planned for 2017. The Municipal Services Improvement Project (MSIP) helped
selected municipalities to improve the financial performance of specific investments, and build the
capacity of municipalities and their communal service enterprises, particularly by undertaking financial
reforms, enhancing communication with residents, and increasing transparency. To date, sub-loans have
been made to 30 of 83 municipalities through the project. At Government’s request, the project received
additional financing in FY12, tripling the original loan amount to US$75 million. MSIP is also used as a
vehicle to increase the absorption of EU Instrument for Pre-Accession (IPA) funds. IFC assisted the GoM
in improving the regulatory framework for waste management as well as building municipalities’
capacity, including through a specialized certified Waste Management course.

Pillar II. More Inclusive Growth by Strengthening Employability and Social Protection

37.
The FY09 Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) Project contributed to the efficiency and
effectiveness of social protection and human capital. The CCT Program has an enrolment rate of 86
percent of households receiving Social Financial Assistance and with children ages 15-18 or older in fulltime secondary education. The program, the first of its kind in the region, conditions cash benefits on
secondary school enrollment and attendance, and has been expanded to include active employment
programs. In addition, through the establishment of the Cash Benefits Management Information System,
the CCT project improved the targeting and administration of services under the social safety net,
including oversight mechanisms, service delivery, and monitoring and evaluation. However, due to the
lack of data, the targeting accuracy indicator for this project in relation to the poorest quintile is
unobservable.
38.
The goal of increasing employment by decreasing labor costs to employers was mostly
achieved. Key reforms supported by the FY11 PBG included reducing Social Insurance Contributions to
27 percent of the gross wages, restraining growth in public sector wages, and improving public sector
wage-setting. These contributed to improving employability by reducing impediments to hiring. The
Government has started to implement employment subsidy programs that lower employment costs,
especially of youth. During CPS implementation, unemployment has fallen modestly and labor force
participation has increased.

Pillar III. Greener Growth: Environmental Sustainability and Climate Action

39.
The World Bank, with significant financial support from Sweden and Norway, undertook a
flagship program of analytic work to help fYR Macedonia better understand the macroeconomic
case for investing in green sectors and “greening” brown sectors as a stimulus for stronger growth.
This work focused on energy, water, transport, agriculture, urban development, and environment, and
helped promote adaptation to climate change and lower-carbon growth options in policy and investment
planning decisions.
40.
The goal to improve the efficiency and environmental sustainability of the energy sector,
particularly by exploiting renewable energy and energy efficiency sources, was achieved, with the
upgrading of energy transmission infrastructure mostly achieved. Additional financing for the
Energy Community of South East Europe (ECSEE) APL 3 reduced the operating and maintenance cost of
selected substations by 25 percent. After delays due to land acquisition, the project is now on track to
44

Annex 2
reduce the number and duration of power supply interruptions by 80 percent. At Government’s request,
the Bank provided a Project Preparation Advance (PPA) to support possible development of a water
storage project at Lukovo Pole in the northwestern part of the country that would allow more efficient use
of existing hydropower plants. The PPA has supported preparation of the detailed design, Environmental
and Social Impact Assessment, and a legal review. The GEF Sustainable Energy Project supported setting
up a large-scale national program to retrofit public buildings in order to increase their energy efficiency,
providing capacity building for this national program while at the same time financing energy efficiency
measures in 40 schools and kindergartens, and leading to Government commitment to improving energy
efficiency across all sectors.
41.
IFC has invested in energy efficiency and supported renewable energy legislation. In 2012
IFC invested $4.6 million in EVN, the sole electricity supply and distribution company serving
640,000 customers, to support its need for additional working capital. Through its PPP transaction
advisory, IFC has been helping the Government to create a new, more attractive, tender for financing
Cebren Hydropower Project, intended to contribute to reducing electricity imports and GHG emissions.
To contribute to private sector participation in "greener" energy, in February 2012 IFC launched in fYR
Macedonia the advisory services program "Renewable Energy in the Western Balkans with a Focus on
Small Hydro Power Plants." Through this program IFC has assisted the Government in adopting key
renewable energy legislation, estimated to have contributed to $48 million in private sector financing for
small power plants.
42.
The CPS supported the strengthening of the management of water resources in line with
EU directives; all water management objectives were achieved. The FY11 Water Sector Capacity
Building TA helped the Government to identify critical infrastructure needed to address water scarcity in
the southeast, most affected by climate fluctuations and changes. The Water Economies were restructured
to form river basin management bodies in line with the EU water directive. The Agriculture Strengthening
and Accession Project (ASAP) also contributed to improving the management of water resources.
43.
The CPS achieved agriculture strengthening objectives, supporting strengthened
competitiveness of the agriculture sector, via improvements in the agricultural subsidy system,
opening of the land market, and adapting practices to climate change and EU requirements.
Agriculture accounts for 18 percent of GDP and substantial employment in rural areas, where 21 percent
of the population live in poverty. The FY07 ASAP enabled the accreditation of the Ministry of
Agriculture to distribute EU Rural Development funds, although it did not address the parallel subsidy
system the Government created. The project also helped complete the restructuring of the irrigation
delivery system and develop veterinary capacity for an EU-compliant food safety system. In addition, it is
supporting the development and dissemination among farmers of a Code of Good Agricultural Practices
integrating biodiversity and agriculture, and promoting sustainable soil and water management. Highlevel policy dialogue led to the government’s commitment to privatization of agricultural land and
enactment of the Law on the Sale of Agricultural Land in State Ownership. Privatization of public lands
has started. This achievement has effectively superseded the mostly achieved outcome of increasing the
rate of lease collection for state-owned agricultural lands.
44.
The World Bank financed fYR Macedonia’s participation in the Southeastern Europe and
Caucasus Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (SEEC CRIF). The overall objective of the SEEC
CRIF is to increase access to financial protection for the Government as well as homeowners, farmers and
SMEs from losses due to weather extremes and geo-hazards. Although the international insurance facility
has taken more time to establish than expected, the targeted insurance penetration is likely to be achieved
in 2014, as anticipated.

45

Annex 2

IV.

WORLD BANK GROUP PERFORMANCE

45.
The overall rating of WBG performance is Good. The WBG successfully contributed to the
pursuit of CPS objectives, 96 percent of which were achieved or mostly achieved. The WBG has mostly
timely adapted to changing circumstances and priorities, responding to challenges ranging from the
economic crisis to client capacity limitations. The program of activities provides a sound platform for the
next strategy.
46.
The CPS quality at entry was Good. The CPS was designed in partnership with the
Government of fYR Macedonia, and its objectives were well aligned with the country’s development
priorities, with about half of the monitored outcomes falling under the Government’s promoting growth
and competitiveness objective.


The CPS design was characterized by continuity, flexibility, complementarity and synergy
within the lending program and between its lending and non-lending elements. The WBG
coordinated planned interventions with development partners, the EU in particular. The CPS was
structured to be particularly flexible over FY13-14 given uncertainty on the pace of economic
recovery and the rapidity of evolving development challenges.



The program continued to move toward greater selectivity and portfolio consolidation,
while using a broad spectrum of instruments. Selectivity was driven largely by client demand,
the WBG’s comparative advantage, and exposure limits. While traditional investment lending
accompanied by hands-on implementation support and informed by related knowledge products
remained the instrument of choice, the Bank used the PBG instrument to great advantage,
leveraging limited exposure space to facilitate fYR Macedonia’s access to private financial
markets. Further, the Bank used grants, analytic work and small pilot interventions to build
momentum in areas where consensus or capacity was insufficient. For example, successful
implementation of the GEF Energy Efficiency project provided practical experience that shifted
the understanding of energy efficiency. Bolstered by technical assistance and recommendations of
the Green Growth analytic work, it has led to Government’s adoption of the National Program of
Energy Efficiency in Public Buildings and decision to establish a revolving Energy Efficiency
Fund to implement it.



The CPS results framework was Fair. While it captured the gist of the Bank’s program, the
results framework contained too many indicators and outcomes, not all observable. Data
shortages were not considered as potential risks. Some indicators were difficult to monitor,
because the client did not have the capacity to provide the data.



While important country-level risks were identified and addressed, the CPS did not discuss
risks to the WBG program. The strategy document noted risks such as the Eurozone crisis,
delay in EU accession, continued high unemployment and natural disasters, all of which continue
to be relevant. CPS interventions successfully mitigated the risk of financial instability
exacerbated by the Eurozone crisis and contributed to efforts to reduce unemployment. The WBG
has provided a substantial amount of information to the Government on climate change and the
green agenda, and support to the Europa Re project has led to introduction of new catastrophe
insurance mechanisms. However, the CPS did not identify risks to the WBG program. In
retrospect, the main challenges to the program were: (a) the introduction of budget ceilings,
which affected the speed of project implementation and disbursements; (b) implementing
agencies’ capacity constraints, which led to slower than expected start up and implementation of
some projects; and (c) in the case of infrastructure projects, issues such as land acquisition and
availability of qualified contractors. While these challenges caused implementation delays, all
46

Annex 2
projects achieved their development objectives or are on track to do so. The WBG program was
concentrated in areas of strong client commitment well aligned with Government priorities,
which helped mitigate the risks to WBG-supported operations.
47.
Quality of implementation was Good. Implementation accommodated changing circumstances
such as the Eurozone crisis and internal financing needs. The CPS Implementation Management Tool was
used for monitoring operations and identifying implementation bottlenecks. The Bank team provided
strong and consistent implementation support, adjusting to evolving circumstances and client needs. At
the same time, it did not take full advantage of the Progress Report to revamp the results framework.
While there was good focus on successful implementation of specific operations, it was not
complemented by regular strategic review of results and priorities, which could have improved
performance under the Inclusive Growth Pillar. A more consistent strategic focus on inclusion was
needed, as were observable progress indicators and a reliable system for monitoring them.


Strong involvement of the local team ensured timely exchange of information and improved
Bank’s responsiveness to client requests. All projects were assigned a contact person in the
local office, and some projects had field based Task Team Leaders. This close and continuous
portfolio management resulted in continuous adjustments to lessons of experience and evolving
needs; except for the most recent approvals, every project in the Bank’s portfolio was restructured
at least once.



According to the Client Survey results and consultations carried out in the course of the
preparation of the new CPS, knowledge services provided by the WBG during the CPS
period were of good quality and well aligned with the country program. The WBG team used
a broad spectrum of knowledge products depending on needs. Most of the analytic work was
closely related to lending. For example, Competitiveness Assessments provided the analytical
foundation of the Competitiveness DPL series, and all lending operations were accompanied by
implementation support and often technical assistance, such as in the case of the Higher
Education TA or advice on the preparation of the National Program of Energy Efficiency of
Public Buildings. The Land Registration and Cadastre project participated in a South-South
exchange with Honduras, sharing project results and lessons with a peer agency. The Labor
Market Assessment was complemented by continuing TA for the Government’s Jobs Strategy.
Recommendations of the Green Growth report were discussed with respective sector authorities
and are likely to inform future Government policy and investment choices.



The CPS reflected a partnership between the World Bank and IFC, set out in a Joint
Business Plan for fYR Macedonia.



The Bank tailored its support in response to changing circumstances. Just-in-time support
was effective in dealing with new challenges and provided timely assistance to the Government
while also contributing to achievement of most outcomes. The Bank has been able to offer the
Government high-quality development solutions while rapidly preparing new lending operations
in response to changed circumstances.



While the WBG has in general adequately responded to changing circumstances during the
CPS, the WBG did not avail itself of the opportunity to revise CPS goals midstream. In
particular, the Bank team could have used the Progress Report more effectively to adjust the
cumbersome results framework. That did not happen in part because of unexpected personnel
shifts during Progress Report preparation.

47

Annex 2


Coordination with development partners was continuous and effective. As a middle income
EU candidate country, fYR Macedonia has a relatively small number of active development
partners, with most bilateral donors cutting back on their presence over time. Donor coordination
is managed by the Government through the Ministry of Finance and Secretariat for European
Integration. The World Bank team maintained regular contact with these coordinating bodies and
actively participated in development partner coordination/information sharing events, including
as part of the new CPS preparation.

V.

LESSONS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR FY15-18 CPS

48.
The Bank is the partner of choice for the Government in carrying out complex reforms, as
shown by the World Bank Client Survey 2014 and analysis of the implementation of the FY11-14
CPS. The Bank must build on the experience of this partnership while continuing to engage with the
Government focusing on the areas where it can have the greatest leverage pursuing its goals of reducing
poverty and sharing prosperity. The Client Survey also points to the need to broaden the engagement with
stakeholders outside the Government and to put more emphasis on promoting openness and availability of
information. The following key lessons should be taken into account in the design of the FY15-18 CPS.


Close alignment with Government objectives, and those of key partners, was important to
the success of the WBG program. Alignment of CPS strategic goals with the EU regional
strategy provided a basis for successful WBG interaction with the EU, particularly on the
improvement of IPA funds absorption, as well as with other development partners.



The WBG should maintain its strategic focus on inclusion and sharing the fruits of
economic growth. Despite a number of encouraging results in the First Pillar, it is not known
whether economic growth has resulted in improvements in living conditions, and if it has, how
these improvements were distributed. Reliable data on the living conditions of the poorer
segments of society and the structure and dynamics of poverty is largely unavailable. As a result,
the Inclusiveness Pillar has been the most challenging both for the Government and the WBG in
terms of achieving results and assessing the effectiveness of interventions.



The next CPS should focus on fewer outcomes, monitored by observable indicators. The
large number of outcomes in the CPS results framework made it hard to use as a practical tool for
dynamic monitoring and adjustment, and complicated focusing on key priorities.



High-level policy dialogue was crucial for achieving a number of outcomes, particularly in the
area of improving the land market and agricultural subsidies.



The Bank should continue to factor the goals of EU integration and more effective use of
IPA funds into operational design and implementation support. As MSIP demonstrated, Bank
projects can facilitate access to and help channel substantial EU funds for which the country is
eligible.



The Government’s commitment and flexibility proved crucial to the success of the IFC PPP

Lessons and suggestions for the
new CPS
All Bank projects should consider
the need and implementing agency’s
capacity for monitoring and
evaluation. Where necessary, Bank
projects should include support for
providing evaluation framework and
establishing a monitoring system
within the implementing agency as
an integral part of the operation.
Investments in border infrastructure
should be coupled with softer trade
facilitation measures (might include
streamlining border procedures,
introducing or widening the use of
customs processing systems using
IT and improving inter-institutional
communication). Such trade
facilitation measures are not costly,
but can have substantial impact on
costs of moving freight.
Land acquisition for infrastructure
projects needs to start early and be
well coordinated across the involved
GoM entities. Time for this process,
which must take place either before
the project or during its initial
stages, needs to be factored into the
project design.

Annex 3

Annex 3: Sources of Growth Diagnostic
FYR Macedonia is a small, landlocked and open economy with a sound track record of
macro-fiscal stability. With an openness indicator34 of 126.3 percent in 2013, it is the most open
among the countries of South East Europe (SEE6)35, although still relatively weak by European
and global standards. FYR Macedonia has been able to preserve macroeconomic stability in the
presence of adverse shocks. Its exchange rate peg to the Euro, introduced in 1995, has
successfully supported price stability, with inflation averaging 2.4 percent over the last 10 years.
Macroeconomic policies have been geared towards keeping the external balance manageable,
and monetary policy has responded quickly to any possible threats to the peg. General
government debt, which reached 36.0 percent of GDP at the end of 2013, remains the fifth
lowest among the EU and SEE6 countries. Growth volatility has been low by regional standards,
but so has growth.
Growth would need to accelerate for fYR Macedonia to close its income gap with the new
EU member states. Between 2002 and 2009, fYR Macedonia grew at 3.9 percent annually in
real terms which – though below the SEE6 average – enabled fYR Macedonia to reduce the
income gap with the EU. Between 2002 and 2009, fYR Macedonia’s GDP per capita in
international dollars grew from 25 percent of the EU’s GDP per capita in international dollars to
36 percent in 2009. Since then, fYR Macedonia’s average GDP growth has declined to 2.1
percent per year and convergence to the EU has stalled. Real GDP growth would need to
accelerate to around 4.5 percent – which is significantly above the ten-year average annual
growth rate of 3.2 percent – for fYR Macedonia to converge to the living standards of the new
EU member states within the next 20 years.
FYR Macedonia’s sectoral drivers of growth have changed noticeably over the past 15
years, with trade and commerce declining and construction taking over as the fastest
growing sector. Prior to 2002, more than 80 percent of growth was driven by trade and
commerce, industry, wholesale and retail. Since 2002, growth in trade and commerce has
significantly declined while industrial growth has remained broadly constant. Since 2009, the
construction sector has become the predominant driver of growth as the public sector scaled up
capital spending to counterbalance the decline in external demand due to the Euro zone crisis.
This seems to have come at the expense of deterioration in the quality of public investment: the
share of investment in administrative buildings increased at the expense of investment in
infrastructure and maintenance36, and investment into sectors with a long-term growth potential
such as machinery, agriculture and transport equipment also declined. Since 2009, agricultural
growth has been zero.

34

The openness indicator is defined as the sum of imports and exports relative to the GDP.
SEE countries include Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Macedonia fYR, Montenegro and Serbia.
36
In 2008, 85 percent of all public investment was destined to infrastructure while only 15 percent went to nonresidential and residetial buildings. By 2012, investments in non-residential and residential buildings doubled as a
share of total public investment, reaching 33 percent.

FYR Macedonia’s growth was driven by both employment and productivity gains before
the crisis, but most job creation occurred in low-productivity sectors or in the public sector.
Despite a relatively large and rising capital share of income from 2001-2008 (between 40 and 50
percent), physical capital accumulation accounted for only 0.3 percentage points of the average
annual 4.3 percent GDP growth between 2002 and 2008, whereas employment growth
contributed 1 percentage point, and Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth roughly 3 percentage
points. After the 2008 crisis, productivity growth decelerated significantly while employment
continued to grow. In fact, fYR Macedonia is the only SEE6 country where employment
increased in the post-crisis period. Agriculture, construction and public administration have been
the main drivers of employment growth over the last decade. However, the jobs created in the
past years have been either informal, in low-productivity sectors or in the public sector: 27.1
percent of net jobs created between 2007 and 2011 have been in agriculture and 13 percent in
retail trade (predominantly informal) and 19.7 percent in the public sector.

Annex 3

Growth in the pre-crisis years was almost exclusively powered by domestic demand,
engendering large and persistent trade deficits and increasing household indebtedness. In
the years leading up to the 2009 crisis, real GDP growth was underpinned by strong private
consumption and rapidly increasing investment, both of which had a large import content and
pushed the trade deficit from an already-large 18.4 percent of GDP in 2005 to over 26 percent by
2008. The trade deficit was largely financed by remittances which in turned fueled private
consumptions. With their savings rates already exceptionally low, households resorted to
borrowing to sustain high rates of private consumption, leading to a rapid rise in household debt,
albeit from low levels by regional standards.37 Since the crisis, however, household disposable
income has made a modest recovery, benefitting from strengthening wage growth, increased
social transfers as part of the crisis response, and an easing of the tax burden on personal income.
At the same time, the uncertain economic environment has tempered household consumption,
bringing it closer in line with disposable income and thus on a more anemic growth path given
the still-weak labor market and persistently high unemployment. This renewed savings impetus
has helped to stabilize the household debt ratio, which stood at 25.8 percent of disposable
income at end-2012.

Annex 3

Table 1: Key macroeconomic indicators

As a small, open economy fYR Macedonia will have to rely on exports to sustain long-term
growth. Supported by an active strategy to promote Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), fYR
Macedonia is shifting gradually to a more export-led growth model. In recent years, fYR
68

Annex 3

Macedonia has diversified its exports both in terms of products and destinations and increased
the technological intensity of its export basket due to FDI. Most FDI-related exports are
connected to the automobile industry and form part of global value chains, which insulates them
somewhat from changes to the European import demand. Still, FDI as a share of GDP is smaller
than in other SEE6 countries. Moreover, foreign firms have very limited linkages to domestic
companies and their contribution to employment growth has so far been limited. This is expected
to change as new, large FDI-related firms start their production. As the Euro zone recovers, fYR
Macedonia’s traditional labor-intensive exports (iron and steel products, apparel and clothing,
which together account for more than 35 percent of all exports) are expected to accelerate. fYR
Macedonia will need to further improve its competitiveness in order to boost its export potential
by investing in infrastructure and improving trade logistics.
Expansionary fiscal policy in the aftermath of the crisis led to a widening of the fiscal
deficit and a rapid build-up in central government debt. Revenues fell by over 3 percent of
GDP between 2008 and 2011, as economic activity weakened and the Government reduced tax
rates and social security contributions to boost competitiveness. Consequently, the fiscal deficit
widened consecutively from 0.9 percent of GDP in 2008 to 2.5 percent in 2011, 3.9 percent in
2012 and 4.1 percent in 2013 and central government debt surged from 20.7 percent in 2008 to
35.8 percent by the end of 2013. At the same time, the Government shifted capital expenditure
off-budget by transforming the former Road Fund into the Public Enterprise for State Roads
(PESR), complicating fiscal management and weakening transparency. At inception, the PESR
carried EUR82 million in debt (1.1 percent of GDP), but this is set to rise rapidly in the near term
as the PESR executes what is fundamentally a central government investment agenda.
The Government is pursuing an ambitious public investment program to boost fYR
Macedonia’s competitiveness, which is expected to lead to a rapid build-up in public debt.
As a landlocked and very open economy, fYR Macedonia is particularly dependent on a welldeveloped transport network for its economic and social development. At the same time, firms
increasingly cite inadequate supply of infrastructure as a major constraint to growth38. The
Government is therefore pursuing an ambitious investment program, which will be largely
implemented by State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), in particular, the PESR. Total public debt is
set to rise rapidly over the medium-term even under the assumption that central government debt
will stabilize.

38

The 2013-14 Global Competitiveness Index ranks the quality of Roads in fYR Macedonia 111th out of 148
countries. While this is slightly better than regional neighbors (Serbia at 119th and Bulgaria at 112th), it lags well
behind Albania (76th) and Montenegro (95th).

Annex 4: FYR Macedonia Country Survey March 2014: Summary of Findings

From December 2013 to January 2014, stakeholders of the World Bank Group in fYR
Macedonia were invited to provide their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by
participating in a country survey. Paper questionnaires were sent to 843 potential respondents. Of
those, 159 were completed with a representative of the fielding agency or were received and
returned via post (19% response rate; all in Macedonian). Online questionnaires were sent to
23,000 potential respondents via email. Of those, 1,012 were completed (4% response rate; 950
in Macedonian and 62 in English).
The FY14 country survey demonstrates that views of the World Bank Group in fYR Macedonia
are very positive, in particular with respect to the way the institution engages on the ground, its
work in key sectors, and its overall relevance and alignment. The survey data also show that
there are opportunities for improving effectiveness. Key findings are summarized below.
Sector engagement: Respondents named
economic growth, agricultural development and
business environment/ private sector development
as the three most important areas for fYR
Macedonia’s development. Bank’s work in all
three of these sectors is seen as highly effective,
with average ratings above 6. Since the last
Country Survey in FY10, there has been an
improvement in the assessment of the
effectiveness of World Bank engagement in all
comparable sector areas. Bank engagement on
economic
growth,
regulatory
framework,
environmental sustainability and agriculture
received the highest ratings for effectiveness.
Engagement on climate change and growth also
saw the largest improvements in the score from
the past survey. In contrast, the effectiveness of
Bank’s work on EU integration received the least
positive assessment (5.8 average rating) and the
smallest improvement since FY10. The work on
job creation and employment, a topic that is seen
as crucial for fYR Macedonia’s inclusive growth, also received a relatively lower rating of 6.2.
How the Bank operates: The way the Bank operates on the ground is also viewed positively. In
contrast to many countries across the globe, opinions are very positive with regard to
disbursements and speed of decision making. Perceptions of the Bank’s relevance and alignment
have increased significantly since FY10. Survey findings show high opinions on a number of
important aspects of WBG engagement including being a long term partner (average score of
8.2), collaboration with the Government (8.1), straightforwardness and honesty (7.7),
responsiveness (7.5) and collaboration with other development partners (7.5). While views of

70

Annex 4

how the Bank collaborates with groups outside government are also positive (6.7), they are
significantly lower than most other ratings.
Areas for improvement: In FY10 respondents identified bureaucracy and being technocratic as
the Bank’s top challenges. In this year’s survey the top factor identified as limiting the
effectiveness of Bank engagement was lack of sensitivity to political and social realities on the
ground. The survey also demonstrated low awareness of the information that the World Bank
produces and discloses, with three out of four respondents reporting that they were not aware of
the WBG’s Access to Information policy. Compared to FY10, fewer respondents felt that they
can find the information they need on the World Bank website, particularly people who do not
collaborate with the World Bank directly. Respondents suggested that the Bank should reach out
more to groups outside of government, with three out of ten noting that the biggest obstacle to
Bank supported reform is that the Bank is not sensitive enough to realities on the ground and 64
percent noting that to be more effective, the WBG should have a greater local presence. Nearly
half of respondents thought that the Bank should step up its engagement with the private sector,
and a third of respondents recommended reaching out to local governments. Responses also
suggest that translating more of the Bank’s knowledge work into Macedonian would help to
improve outreach.
Recommendations for future engagement and adding value: stakeholders believe there would
be great value in the WBG offering more innovative financial instruments. Financial services
emerge at the top when respondents consider the combination of services that the Bank offers.
Forty five percent of respondents report that the Bank should offer more financial services in
fYR Macedonia (versus 25 percent who named knowledge services as the top area for additional
focus). Capacity development is also seen as an important area for future Bank involvement. In
terms of the sectors of engagement, stakeholders believe that the most important areas for WBG
involvement are transport (particularly as related to economic diversification) and growth
followed by a range of areas (governance, education, poverty, business environment, job
creation).

Annex 5

Annex 5: Gender Assessment

FYR Macedonia has largely closed average gender gaps in education and health; however,
gender disparities persist for certain population subgroups. For example, gender gaps in
enrollment rates still exist among ethnic Albanians, and secondary enrollment rates remain
particularly low for ethnic Roma men and women. Overall, average learning outcomes are better
for women than for men in fYR Macedonia, as in most countries in the region. The rapid
expansion of private post-secondary education institutions, the expansion of state-funded
programs in Albanian and introduction of compulsory secondary education from 2008, provision
of free of charges text books and coverage of transportation, as well as implementation of the
conditional cash transfers for the beneficiary households of social financial assistance are
contributing to increased participation of females in the educations process.
Men and women, however, tend to choose different fields of study. Women are more likely to
choose general programs and subjects related to the social sciences. Men are more likely instead
to choose engineering, production, or construction. Moreover, a low share of both men and
women choose not to pursue additional training, but the reasons for this decision differ by
gender. In 2010, less than two percent of women and men declared to have undertaken training
in the past month. Both men and women cite lack of interest as a reason for not pursuing
additional education, but approximately 19 percent of women and 1.5 percent of men also cite
family obligations.
There is no evidence of gender-based differences in access to health services. The country
performs well when it comes to births attended by skilled health staff and adolescent fertility.
Close to 100 percent of births are attended by health staff. The fertility rate (at around 1.4 births
per women) is slightly lower compared to the region and so is the maternal mortality rate.
Mortality rates are lower compared to income and regional peers and only slightly higher
compared to EU countries. Furthermore, women have lower mortality rates (74 per 1,000 adult
women compared to 139 per 1,000 adult men) which also translate into higher life expectancy
for women (around 77 years, compared to a national average of 73 years).
Gender inequalities remain in access to economic opportunities in fYR Macedonia. In 2012,
female labor force participation (for women aged 15-65) in fYR Macedonia was 51 percent,
which is lower than the regional average of 62 percent. Moreover, between 2004 and 2012, male
labor force participation increased by 6 percentage points while female labor force participation
increased by 4 percentage points. This indicates a gender gap in participation of 26 percentage
points in 2012. For those in the labor market, unemployment rates for men and women are
similar. A gender wage gap persists, even after controlling for other characteristics, with men
commanding higher wages.
Gender gaps in labor markets exist between and within socio-economic groups. For
instance, the employment rate for men in the bottom 40 percent in fYR Macedonia is 32 percent
(in the remaining 60 percent is 34), while it is 14 percent for women in the same group but 23
percent for women in the top 60 percent

72

Annex 5

Gender gaps in accessing economic opportunities are tightly linked to differences across
ethnic groups. The data available indicate that labor force participation among ethnic minorities
is often significantly lower than among ethnic Macedonians, especially among women. Whereas
ethnic Macedonian women have an employment rate of 41 percent, only 10 percentage points
lower than their male counterparts, women who are ethnically Turkish have an employment rate
of 27 percent – a 32 percentage point gap with men with the same ethnic background. Roma and
ethnic Albanian women lag even further behind in terms of employment, with employment rates
of only 7 and 6 percent, respectively. Low employment rates among ethnic minority women are
driven by higher inactivity rates rather than by higher unemployment. Generally, activity rates
among ethnic minorities are about two or three times lower among women than among men.

based on LFS (2006).
Note: 2006 is the last year when data is publicly available on ethnicity in the LFS. In this graphs, it is important to
note that the LFS data is not representative by ethnicity so there may be some discrepancies with actual data at the
population level.

In terms of entrepreneurship, although female-managed businesses are as productive as
male-managed businesses, few women are entrepreneurs. Fewer women decide to start a
business than men, but success rates do not differ according to the gender of the entrepreneur.
Analysis based on the 2010 LITS database reveals that 12 percent of women and 19.7 percent of
men decided to start-up a firm. Seventy-three percent of men and 74 percent of women who start
a business achieve success.
Few businesses are managed by women, and women managers work mainly in femaleowned businesses. Analysis based on the World Bank Enterprise Survey (2013), which looks at
established small, medium, and large businesses, shows that 29.4 percent of firms in fYR
Macedonia have female participation in ownership compared to 33 percent in ECA and 37
percent globally. The highest share of female ownership - 37.8 percent - is in exporting firms
(direct exports are at least 10 percent of all sales) compared to 31.6 percent in ECA and 36.7
percent in all countries. 26.3 percent of interviewed Macedonian firms have women in top
management, which is higher than ECA (21.3 percent) and global (19.0 percent) averages. The
73

Annex 5

share of women managers is again significantly higher in exporting firms - 35.7 percent of firms
have a female top manager as compared to 16 percent in ECA, 14.7 percent in all countries, and
in 24.9 percent in non-exporting firms in fYR Macedonia.
Contrary to other countries, men and women in fYR Macedonia differ little in the sector in
which they are engaged, whether we identify male and female businesses based on the
gender of the manager or on the gender of the owner. The majority of male- and femalemanaged businesses are in the retail sector while a larger percentage of male-managed
businesses than female-managed businesses can be found in the sectors of transport,
construction, garment, and fabricated metal materials. More female- than male-managed
businesses can be found in the sectors of retail, chemicals, food, and plastic and rubber industry.
Similar distribution patterns across sectors can be found when disaggregating the data by gender
of the owner. These differences in business sector affiliation are probably related to preferences
for different areas of study at vocational and higher education level.
Gender gaps are not observed in the share of men and women who attempted to borrow
money to start a business, in the success rates of obtaining a loan, or in the source of
financing. On access to credit, the share of females who attempted to borrow money to start a
business is low but similar to that of males (approximately 38 percent of females, compared to
41 percent of males). Among them, 75 percent of females and 71 percent of males obtained the
loan. Relatives represent the main source of finance for both genders (47 percent and 48 percent
respectively), followed by banks in the case of females (35 percent of females and 26 percent of
males) and by friends in the case of males (26 percent of men and 10 percent of women).
FYR Macedonia has made continuous progress in advancing gender relations. The legal
framework for gender equality is comprehensive and provides for equal treatment of both
genders. The 2005 Labor Code endorses the definition of gender-based discrimination and
provides a framework for anti-discrimination measures. According to the Law on Family all
forms of abuse are prohibited, while the Law on Inheritance gives equal rights to both males and
females. The Criminal Code punishes gender-based discrimination and all forms of domestic
abuse and violence; rape is punishable under Article 186 of the Penal Code for a period of one to
ten years.
The Law on Equal Opportunities was adopted in May 2006 and amended in 2012; this was
followed by establishment of the special Parliamentary commission on equal opportunities in
September 2006 and the Sector for Equal Opportunities within the Ministry for Labor and Social
Policy in March 2007. A new Strategy for Gender Equality (2013 -2020) was adopted in 2013
and consequently a new National Action Plan for Gender Equality (2013-2016), and the
operational plan for 2013.

Following the consultative meetings in early 2013, the WB and IFC country teams developed a
“Note on WB-IFC Collaboration in Macedonia” which defined a set of specific activities aimed
at enhancing the WB–IFC collaboration in the country, to be undertaken in the remaining period
of the joint Country Partnership Strategy (FY11-14).
The Note envisaged the following activities and milestones:






WB-IFC Collaboration Group has been established, led by the World Bank Country
Manager, Tatiana Proskuryakova and IFC Country Officer, Zoran Martinovski. The
Group identified four priority areas for WB-IFC collaboration in Macedonia, as
follows:
(1) Trade Logistics,
(2) Job Creation and Employment
(3) Energy, with special focus on Energy Efficiency and Renewables, and
(4) Working with municipalities.
Joint WB-IFC Contact Groups have been created for each of the priority areas and
tasked to take stock of ongoing and planned activities in each priority area, identify
key next steps, points of potential cooperation, timing as well as to report back any
encountered constraints and how to address them. The lessons learned were meant to
be used to inform the development of the next planning document (CPS or Business
Plan) for the period beyond FY14.
Goals and Principles of Collaboration: The collaboration of the World Bank and the
IFC in Macedonia is grounded on the World Bank Group’s core strengths
(knowledge, finance and talent) and organizational culture of risk tolerance,
leadership, and collaboration. The objective is to improve our organizational
effectiveness and deliver results to our client with the objective of eliminating
extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity in the country.
Progress Update
Current Operations and Cooperation in the Priority Areas

(1) Trade Logistics
Operations:
a. Western Balkans Regional Trade Logistics Project. The goal of the Project is
reduction of regulatory and administrative bottlenecks to regional cross-border trade
by streamlining export and import procedures, harmonizing inter-agency cooperation
within and between countries, and championing risk-based controls, including wider
use of electronic systems for data exchange and trade logistics -related payments.

Project Manager Violane Konar-Leacy (Operations Officer, CEUIC). Duration:
2012-October 2014.
b. Programmatic Competitiveness Development Policy Loan (DPL), a series of two
DPLs ($50 USD million equivalent, each) The objective of the project is to strengthen
the competitiveness of fYR Macedonia’s economy by incentivizing productive
investment and technology upgrading in the manufacturing, agribusiness and trade
logistics sectors, and establishing enabling conditions to progressively increase labor
market flexibility and innovation capacity. Task Team Leader, John Gabriel Goddard
(Senior Economist, ECSF2). Duration: 2012-October 2014.
c. Macedonia Competitive Industries and Innovation Support Program (MCIISP), aims
at increasing the impact of the Programmatic Competitiveness DPL series and a Skills
Development and Innovation Support Project and provide seed funding that will help
identify future operations. The Program encompasses four sectoral components
(manufacturing, agribusiness, trade logistics and tourism) while skills development
and innovation are cross-cutting areas. Team Leaders: John Gabriel Goddard (Senior
Economist, ECSF2) and Gordana Popovikj Friedman (Private Sector Development
Specialist, ECSF3). Duration: July 2013-June 2016.
Areas of Cooperation:
The World Bank Competitiveness DPL and MCIISP Team and IFC’s Western Balkans Trade
Logistics Project Team continued the collaboration on completing the design and the
implementation of the policies under the Third Pillar (Trade Logistics) of Competitiveness DPL
series. The prior actions under the Third Pillar (Improving the efficiency of trade logistics
services) were successfully completed by January 2014. The preparation of DPL2 was completed
and the operation was approved by the World Bank Board of Directors on March 13, 2014.
DPL2 is supporting comprehensive improvements in the risk-based approach to border controls
performed by the technical inspections (Food and Veterinary Agency and State Sanitary and
Health Inspectorate), in line with EU best practice. The Bank Team has provided technical
assistance for these activities under the CIIP grant, in close cooperation with IFC’s Western
Balkans Trade Logistics Project. The capacity building of the State Sanitary and Health
Inspectorate and Food and Veterinary Agency in the risk-based approach methodology
implementation is continuing through in–country workshops with international technical experts.
In addition, the team is reviewing a request from the Food and Veterinary Agency for design of a
software platform for data collection as the prerequisite for a successful application of the riskbased approach to technical inspections. A request for similar software has also been announced
by the State Sanitary and Health Inspectorate.
Successful application of the risk-based approach is a critical trade facilitation improvement to
address the costs and delays from unnecessary controls and inspections.

(2) Job Creation and Employment:
Operations:
a.
Applying the 2013 WDR Framework in ECA Technical Assistance consists of four
pieces of analytical work: Macedonia Labor Market Assessment 2011-2011; Gender
Gaps in Labor Markets in Macedonia; Assessment of Labor Regulations in
Macedonia; and A Regional Review of Labor Regulations in the Western Balkans.
The objective of this work is to underpin a broader Jobs Strategy which would address
constraints to job creation in Macedonia, and could serve for continued collaboration,
in particular the development of the National Jobs Strategy for 2015. The Jobs
Strategy will be a critical analytical underpinning for the new CPS (FY14-17). Team
Leader: Indhira Vanessa Santos, Economist (ECSH4). Duration: 2013-2015.
b.
Skills Development and Innovation Support Project ($24 million USD investment
loan), aims to improve transparency of resource allocation and promote accountability
in higher education, enhance the relevance of secondary technical vocational
education, and support innovation capacity in Macedonia. Team Leader: Bojana
Naceva, Senior Education Specialist (ECSH1). Duration: January 2014-May 2019.
c.
Let’s Work Initiative will implement job-creation strategies both at the country level
and also at the company level. These pilot programs will identify sectors and areas that
have the most potential to create more and better jobs, help remove obstacles and get
going private sector -led job growth. At the country level, the Let’s Work initiative
will produce guidance notes, good-practice lessons and training and learning events.
At the company level, the partnership will work with specific organizations to
articulate and strengthen their job creation effects by focusing on value chain
development. It will also develop and refine methods and data for estimating direct
and indirect jobs. Duration 2013-2016.
Collaboration on Job Creation and Employment
In November 2013 the IFC, under the Let’s Work Initiative and the World Bank (Country Unit
and MCIISP Team) jointly organized a high level round table discussion in Skopje which
brought together the government of fYR Macedonia and private sector leaders from two key
sectors –automotive and agribusiness –to discuss opportunities for creating jobs and stimulating
growth in the automotive and agribusiness sectors. The discussions helped to identify and arrive
at a consensus on key priorities for action for further developing these two sectors and creating
jobs in the country. Following the joint event, the WB and IFC developed a joint plan of
initiatives to advance the development of the sectors.
One of the areas for collaboration in the near term is development of a supplier linkages program
around anchor firms, likely foreign investors, with resources and technical assistance from the
IFC and the MCIISP. The IFC has approached foreign manufacturing companies located in the
special economic zone Skopje 1 and identified opportunities for backward linkages for local
suppliers through innovation, technology transfer and investment which could be facilitated
through knowledge from the MCIISP, grants from the World Bank-funded Skills Development
and Innovation Project, knowledge through MCIISP and the IFC and future investments by the
IFC.

77

Annex 6

The IFC and the World Bank FPD Team continued the discussions and cooperation in the
following period, which has resulted in development of a concept for a program to support
development of backward linkages.
The goal of the proposed program is to foster spillover effects to the domestic economy through
established backward linkages around the foreign automotive companies present in fYR
Macedonia, thereby generating more sales, and increasing direct and indirect employment
opportunities for local firms. The future growth of the Macedonian economy depends on a
stronger integration between foreign investors and local supply chains. This will contribute to
country’s economic diversification and enhanced resistance to external shocks.
The concept note envisions the following objectives:






Increased availability of information about opportunities for linkages through the
development of a catalog of products and services available from local suppliers and of
products and services requested by foreign investors; organize targeted B2B/Networking
events to bring together local suppliers with foreign investors;
Improved Supply Chain Enabling Regulatory Environment through addressing regulatory
obstacles arising from investors already operating in the TIDZ and develop Incentive
Schemes to motivate local suppliers to work with foreign investors;
Strengthened linkages between local suppliers and foreign investors through technical
assistance for upgrading existing and potential local suppliers’ capacities;
Enhanced access to finance through facilitation of financial assistance offered by foreign
companies to local suppliers; increasing the awareness for existing funding schemes of
relevance to foreign investors and local companies;

Next steps: As part of the pre-implementation (preparation) phase, further analysis and mapping
will be carried out in order to confirm and deepen the findings from previously undertaken
activities, which would allow more specific tailor-made activities and objectives to be set. The
pre-implementation phase would allow to better understand the market, the supply chain
challenges, the competitive advantages around which the program should be specifically focused
and draw a baseline for the program. This phase would be a critical one that would help the
program to find better focus, i.e., to be more effective.
The pre-implementation phase will be supported with technical assistance and policy advice
through the MCIISP grant.

efficiency of its distribution system through its investment in the private operator, EVN
Macedonia. December 2010-ongoing.
c. Energy Community of South East Europe (ECSEE) APL3. The Project supports the
functioning of AD MEPSO in the context of the regional power market through
financing investments necessary to rehabilitate and upgrade the power transmission
network, increase the level of interconnection with neighboring power systems, and to
strengthen the institutional capacity of AD MEPSO. Team Leader: Peter Johansen
Senior Energy Specialist (EASWE). Duration: March 2006-November 2015.
Collaboration on Energy (Renewable Energy Sources and Energy Efficiency)
The Balkans Renewable Energy Program (BREP) team is providing technical assistance to the
Ministry of Economy (MOE) and Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning (MOEPP) in
the country on regulatory and investment promotion related improvements in the RE sector.
Through BREP, IFC is also focused at providing technical assistance for a private developer of
biomass power plant in the country. IFC is also focused on successful closure of “Crna River
HPP” transaction mandate, and will provide continuous support to improve the operational
efficiency of the country’s distribution system through its investment in the private operator,
EVN Macedonia.
The BREP team in cooperation with the World Bank (WB) and Investment Climate (IC) teams
delivered investment promotion tools for MOEPP related to the forthcoming and further Small
Hydro Power Plant (SHPP) tenders, namely, (i) the SHPP MS Power Point presentation to be
delivered at targeted markets through the Invest in Macedonia Agency offices abroad, and (ii)
the SHPP investor friendly portal. In addition, BREP team delivered a Methodology for FiTs for
Geothermal sources, with suggested FiT tariff price to the MOE, in order to facilitate
Government’s efforts for increased use of RE sources in the country. Finally, BREP team
continuously advises MOEPP on the forthcoming 6th tender on SHPPs. As a result, the
Government is in the process of bundling of SHPP sites to become more investor attractive,
revising the FiT price for SHPPs (incentivizing smaller sites), and revising the Grid Distribution
Code (to enhance SHPP’s connection to the distribution grid).
The team organized workshops and conducted wide (private sector and cross donor) consultation
for the improved regulatory framework on RE/SHPPs (PPA, Connection Agreement, and
Concession Contract). Outputs delivered to the MOE, MOEPP.
Revised tender documents for “Crna River HPP” have been provided to the Government as part
of the transaction mandate.
Challenges: Coordination between the WB and IFC Project teams should be improved.
Information flow is limited. Developments by the Government in creating RE market (re: results
of the 6th SHPP tender; support adoption of regulatory improvements; provision of RE/SHPP
Project Finance training to the country’s financing institutions). Successful closure of “Crna
River HPP” transaction mandate.
