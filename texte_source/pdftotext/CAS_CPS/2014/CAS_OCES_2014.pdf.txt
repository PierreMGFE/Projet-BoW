EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
i.
The small, open economies of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS)
have been trapped for years in low growth, high debt, and limited fiscal space, exacerbated
by a number of external shocks. The impact of the 2008 global financial crisis was severe as
tourism, remittances, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and official development flows decreased
sharply, growth rates plummeted, debt and fiscal imbalances increased to unsustainable levels,
and labor market conditions deteriorated. With decreasing productivity and weak external
demand in key sectors, decreasing FDI, and continued structural weaknesses, these impacts are
still lingering today. The financial sector demonstrated limited capacity to support growth and
job creation. In addition, natural disasters have periodically taken a large toll on the region,
affecting lives, infrastructure, and economic activity. The OECS’s bleak economic performance
has exacerbated social problems: unemployment has been growing at alarming rates, especially
among the youth; and poverty, which was relatively high before 2008, has very likely worsened.
ii.
Against this background, resumption of inclusive growth, generation of
employment, and increased economic and social resilience are the priorities of OECS
governments. Macroeconomic sustainability is a key objective of OECS governments. They
understand that strengthening the financial sector, continuing to improve the investment climate,
and enhancing the competitiveness of key sectors are critical to support the resumption of private
investment and development of key economic sectors that can generate growth and employment.
In order to achieve this objective, reducing the cost of electricity, which is among the highest in
the world, and increasing Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) connectivity are
important. OECS governments recognize that a modernized public sector, including a stronger
framework for public-private partnerships, would contribute to improving fiscal management
and public service delivery as well as strengthening social safety nets and equipping the labor
force with the skills needed to find jobs would help improve social resilience and employability.
Finally, the OECS governments agree that better disaster prevention and risk management are
critical.
iii.
The OECS Regional Partnership Strategy (RPS) for FY15-19 is consistent with the
holistic approach adopted by the OECS Governments to tackle the long-standing issues of
low growth and debt sustainability. The OECS countries acknowledge the multifaceted nature
of their challenges and have elaborated their own vision considering that improvements in
competitiveness, reduction in sovereign debt levels, fiscal adjustments to ensure macro
sustainability, and enhance resilience to shocks are interrelated aspects all critical to resume and
sustain inclusive growth. The Bank has supported this approach and, at the request of the Heads
of Government of CARICOM countries, has elaborated the Comprehensive Debt Framework
(CDF) which aims at helping governments, consistently with their own visions, in the design of
country specific solutions to their high indebtedness. The CDF is the context in which the Bank
undertakes its dialogue with the OECS and defines its assistance program.
iv.
In that context, the objective of the RPS is to contribute to laying the foundations
for sustainable inclusive growth through three areas of engagement: (i) competitiveness, (ii)
public sector modernization, and (iii) resilience. Drawing on a diagnostic of the main
obstacles to poverty reduction and shared prosperity, under the RPS the World Bank Group
(WBG) will work in close partnership with the IMF and the Caribbean Development Bank to

i

support governments’ efforts on the much needed fiscal adjustment, and on strengthening the
financial sector, with the objective of contributing to macro-financial stability and enabling the
resumption of financing activities to support growth and investments. In parallel, the WBG will
focus on laying the foundations for increased private participation in the economy by creating a
more effective investment climate and promoting the competitiveness of industries with high
potential, including tourism and agribusiness. Over the long run, this is expected to contribute to
higher investments, private sector activity, and ultimately growth and employment, as well as to
poverty reduction in rural areas where many smallholders live. The RPS will also support
enhanced efficiency in the supply of, and demand for, electricity and diversification of energy
supply away from fossil fuels, with the objective of enhancing the competitiveness of key sectors
of the economy and contributing to enhanced shared prosperity. A significant impact on the price
of electricity will, however, require work extending beyond the RPS period. Finally, the RPS
aims to support better disaster risk management and resilience, as well as investments in human
capital, including through more effective social protection systems, better quality of education
and employability of the labor force, and greater use of evidence-based policy to address noncommunicable diseases.
v.
This WBG program will be financed through a highly selective package of regional
Bank lending operations and by leveraging additional resources. Three new operations are
planned: a Competitiveness project, a Renewable Energy project, and a Social Resilience and
Human Development project. A fourth operation to support financial sector strengthening could
also materialize in the context of adequate progress on developing a comprehensive financial
sector strategy - in collaboration with the IMF, the ECCB and the CDB - and under a suitable
policy and regulatory environment. To capitalize on the benefits of regional integration while
enabling strong country ownership, each operation will be designed under a regional framework,
as appropriate, but developed and implemented at national level. Implementation of the existing
portfolio will further contribute to achieving the RPS development objectives, particularly in the
areas of disaster risk management, ICT connectivity, and reforms of the public and social
sectors. As IBRD and IDA resources are limited in the OECS and needs very large, leveraging
additional trust fund and grant resources is integral to the success of this RPS.
vi.
Constrained in general by the small size of investments in the OECS, the IFC and
MIGA will contribute to the RPS objectives through selective investment support,
depending on opportunities. The IFC will focus on crisis response; job creation and inclusive
growth; innovation, competitiveness, and integration; and climate change. MIGA faces limited
opportunities for engagement because of the small market size of the OECS countries.
Improvements in the financial sector and development of PPPs are likely to enable a greater role
for IFC and MIGA.
vii.
The program proposed in this RPS might be reviewed at the time of the first
Performance and Learning Review. The emphasis of the WBG engagement and allocation of
resources to the various priority areas would depend on governments’ priorities and demand for
Bank support at the time of the review. As the timing and form of support to the OECS financial
sector remain uncertain, flexibility in the implementation of the RPS will be required. In
particular, speedy progress on the financial sector reforms would require a shift of support and
resources away from other areas of the RPS, while a slower pace might require an increased
focus on the RPS resilience pillar, especially on building stronger safety nets to support the most

ii

vulnerable. Thus, the program, including key areas of engagement and results, may be
significantly adjusted at the time of the first Performance and Learning Review (PLR).
viii. The proposed program faces high risks stemming from a fragile macroeconomic,
financial and social framework, exposure to exogenous shocks, complex political economy
issues, feeble regional cooperation, and weak institutional capacity. Persistent high levels of
debt and fiscal imbalances constrain countries’ ability to build fiscal buffers to manage shocks
and sustain confidence and investment. A weak financial sector is a source of potential macro
risks and limits the financing of private sector investment. This, in turn, might undermine the
achievement of greater competitiveness in the leading sectors of the economy. Social tensions
could increase if unemployment, especially among youth, continues to rise and might generate
lack of consensus to move forward the development agenda that the WBG is supporting.
Exposure to economic and natural shocks remains a threat to the achievement of results on
structural reforms and fiscal management. Weak capacity and a complex political economy
could stall needed reforms and impact the possibility to modernize the public sector as well as to
take actions to improve social protection systems and the delivery of basic social services. Weak
regional cooperation could jeopardize the adoption of actions needed to implement regional
projects. To mitigate this risk, the OECS governments have committed to implement a program
of reforms focused on fiscal sustainability and macro stability, which have been expressed in
their national and regional strategies, while the WBG will maintain a systematic dialogue with
the authorities and other partners to better understand the political economy context in each
country. Moreover, the WBG will use flexibility, within the context of the RPS and in line with
Governments’ needs, to allocate resources as events develop and will provide technical
assistance and training initiatives, embedded in the operations when feasible, to contribute to
increased institutional capacity.

1. COUNTRY DIAGNOSIS
A.

Recent Economic Developments

1.
For years, the small states of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS)
have been trapped in a spiral of low growth, high debt, limited fiscal space, and growing
social problems, exacerbated by a number of external shocks. 1 Since the 1990s, growth in the
OECS countries has been subdued. Growth was further hit hard by the global financial crisis of
2008, and in most OECS countries growth has not returned to pre-crisis levels. Overall, OECS
countries ranked among developing countries with the lowest growth in the world between 2003
and 2012 (Fig. 1). Low growth, combined with natural disasters and imprudent fiscal policies,
has led to persistent fiscal deficits. Structural fiscal problems have resulted in turn in a sizable
accumulation of debt in the region, leading to fragile macroeconomic frameworks. This
lackluster performance has exacerbated social problems: unemployment has been growing at
alarming rates, especially among the youth.

Subdued growth
2.
Over the last two decades, economic growth has been elusive in the OECS. In the
1980s growth averaged 5.9 percent per year, largely driven by an expansion of agricultural
exports (mainly bananas and sugar) under preferential trade arrangements with Europe, large aid
inflows that followed independence from the United Kingdom, and an initial spurt in the tourism
sector. In the early 1990s, the region experienced a dramatic shift in its external trade position
when many economies lost preferential access to European markets. Average annual growth
dropped to 3.3 percent at the end of the decade. In the early 2000s, OECS governments’ efforts
to offset exogenous shocks through increased public investment did not translate into a revival of
growth; rather, they crowded out private investment. The growing fiscal imbalances associated
with increased public investment were financed by expensive domestic and external commercial
borrowing and resulted in an unsustainably large debt burden. In addition, the deterioration in the
external environment caused a contraction in exports and in the resource balance.
3.
The 2008 global economic crisis further weakened growth. After the onset of the
global financial crisis, economic growth in OECS countries contracted for four consecutive years
(on average, by 1.5 percent per year), leading to a cumulative drop of 6 percent in total output
during 2009-2012. Per capita income declined on average by 4.5 percent from around US$9,200
in 2008 to US$8,800 in 2012 (Table 1). The largest fall in per capita income was felt in Antigua
and Barbuda (17 percent compared to the pre-crisis level), which experienced a cumulative
output contraction of 22 percent of GDP during 2009-2011. Dominica, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent
and the Grenadines were less affected by the crisis compared to neighboring countries: St. Lucia
maintained low, but positive growth from the time of the crisis through 2011. After two
consecutive years of negative growth, St. Vincent and the Grenadines recorded positive growth
from 2011 on. However, across the OECS, recovery has remained fragile. 2

The OECS, created in 1981, comprises six independent countries and three British Overseas Territories (Anguilla,
Montserrat, and the British Virgin Islands). This RPS covers the six independent OECS countries: Antigua and
Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Apart from St.
Vincent and the Grenadines, which has not yet joined the IFC, all are members of the World Bank Group.

4.
Since the crisis, growth has remained subdued due to declining competitiveness in
key sectors and weak external demand. Despite a slight rebound in 2013, with regional real
output growth averaging 0.7 percent, economic activity in most countries has remained sluggish.
The OECS countries rely extensively on tourism, construction, agriculture, and financial
services, which in 2013 represented respectively 8.7, 3 8.6, 4.3, and 9.3 percent of GDP. The
OECS’s lackluster growth performance since the global financial crisis was accentuated by the
weakening competitiveness of the tourism sector and the continued low demand related to the
slow recovery in advanced economies: the share of tourism receipts from the US, UK, and
Canada to the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU) 4 declined by 37 percent, and the
region was not able to attract visitors from other potential markets with higher growth.
5.
Large remittances to the region have typically helped ease external constraints to
growth. Over the past two decades the OECS has seen a significant migration of skilled labor
out of the region, and has in return benefitted from large private remittances, ranging from
US$20 million in Antigua and Barbuda (2 percent of GDP in 2012) to US$45 million in St. Kitts
and Nevis (6 percent of GDP in 2012). In some countries, remittances exceed the value of
exports (Fig. 2). Remittance flows to the region have been one of the most important sources of

This value indicates the direct contribution of travel and tourism to GDP, or total “internal” spending in a
particular country on travel and tourism by residents and nonresidents for business and leisure purposes, as well as
government “individual” spending on travel and tourism services directly linked to visitors—cultural (e.g.,
museums) or recreational (e.g., national parks).

development flows. 5

before and after the crisis

6.
However, remittances fell during the
crisis and have made only a modest
recovery since. Traditionally, remittances
have increased during crises, helping
households and investors weather shocks. 6
This time, however, there was a substantive
drop in overall remittance inflows—they fell
by 15 percent between 2007 and 2010. In
addition, the rate of recovery has been slow:
while remittance receipts have picked up since
2011, they have barely returned to pre-crisis
levels, exacerbating the impact of the crisis on
growth.

Fiscal imbalances
7.
Low growth, combined with frequent natural disasters and imprudent fiscal
policies, has led to persistent fiscal deficits throughout the region. The sluggish economic
recovery has had implications for revenue performance, while OECS countries implemented
fiscal stimulus packages that led to a surge in current expenditures. Total revenue collection in
the region (including grants) dropped by an average of 1.3 percentage points from the crisis to
2012, but recovered to pre-crisis level in 2013 (Fig. 3). Overall fiscal balances plunged in 2009,
and, while they recovered progressively afterwards, the overall fiscal deficit remained elevated
reaching 2.6 percent of GDP in 2013. In St. Kitts and Nevis and Dominica, fiscal positions have
improved because of the recent introduction of a value-added tax (VAT) 7 and strong receipts
from the Citizenship-by-Investment (CBI) program, 8 while in the other countries large
expenditures have continued to put pressure on fiscal balances.

Unsustainable debt levels
8.
Structural fiscal problems, combined with external shocks, have resulted in a sizable
accumulation of debt in the region: aggregate public debt reached 86.7 percent of GDP at end2013 and all OECS countries had debt levels greater than 70 percent of GDP (Table 2). The fact
that more than half of the debt is external, nonconcessional, and held by commercial banks
contributes to high debt service costs (on average, 3 percent of GDP in 2013), leaving the region
with little fiscal space for growth-enhancing investment. A recent Bank Debt Sustainability
Analysis shows that public debt levels in most OECS countries are unsustainable. Although
some countries have embarked on debt restructuring since 2009, 9 these interventions have not
been large enough to reestablish debt sustainability and market access in a durable way.

Outlook
9.
Going forward, growth is expected to pick up gradually. As the economic activity of
its main trading partners (the US, Europe -in particular the UK-, and Canada) recovers, the
OECS’s external demand is projected to improve. Major growth drivers in the OECS, such as
tourism, construction, and agriculture, are also expected to pick up, 10 thanks in part to several
investment projects in the tourism sector that are under way across the region 11. Overall, growth
is expected to pick up gradually to reach a regional average of around 3 percent annually over
the medium term.
10.
However, declining FDI inflows and large current account deficits expose the region
to increased volatility. FDI inflows to the OECS declined by 5 percentage points between 2008
and 2012 (from 12.3 percent to 7.3 percent of GDP), shifting away from the OECS to other
Caribbean destinations (Fig. 4). In parallel, the OECS’s average current account deficit has
declined by more than 10 percentage points (from 28.7 percent of GDP in 2008 to 17.9 percent
in 2013) because of lower imports and strong service receipts, mainly driven by the CBI
program. However, the current account deficit is projected to remain high at 16 percent of GDP
by 2017 as tourism receipts increase (from 19.5 percent of GDP in 2014 to 20.2 percent in 2017)
but inflows from the CBI program slow down over the medium term.

Growth in tourism, construction, and agriculture is expected to increase from 1.7, 1.6, and 4.5 percent in 2013 to
2.1, 2.8, and 4.6 percent in 2014, respectively.
11
E.g., construction of Sandal Resort in Grenada and new international airport in St. Vincent and the Grenadines.

11.
Financing needs in the region are high and sources volatile. Financing of the current
account deficit has relied heavily on government borrowing and short-term flows into the
banking sector. The region is also dependent on a number of nontraditional sources of financing,
including the CBI programs, oil financing arrangements, and non-market financing sources.
Volatility associated with these sources of financing could expose OECS countries to important
vulnerabilities. In particular, a disruption or modification of the terms of oil financing could
affect the external accounts of OECS countries and generate fiscal pressures. And while the CBI
programs have been a significant source of funding for several OECS countries in recent years
(providing revenues equal to 13 percent of GDP in St. Kitts in 2013 and of nearly 4 percent in
Dominica), they are uncertain, especially as such programs proliferate in the region (e.g.,
Antigua and Barbuda and Grenada restarted in 2013 and 2014, respectively).
12.
Financial sector stress creates additional downside risk. The ECCU financial sector 12
has come under considerable stress as a result of the combination of exogenous and endogenous
factors: (i) the global financial crisis; (ii) low economic growth; (iii) the insolvency in 2009 of
two large insurers based in Trinidad with large presence in the ECCU; 13 (iv) weak underwriting
criteria and risk management policies in banks; and (v) lack of a sufficiently robust regulatory
framework and supervision. As a result, the quality of assets has deteriorated significantly,
profitability has declined, and credit to the private sector has contracted during the last five
years. The lack of a lender of last resort, a deposit insurance scheme, and fiscal space has
prevented the authorities from effectively supporting weak institutions, leaving the financial
sector vulnerable and unable to meet the intermediating needs of OECS economies. In addition,
OECS countries stand at varying levels of compliance with anti-money laundering/countering
the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) international standards, leaving financial institutions
vulnerable to illicit financial activity.
B.

Poverty and Shared Prosperity

13.
Against the backdrop of low growth and persisting systemic vulnerabilities, poverty
remains a concern. The scant availability of data on poverty and social indicators in the OECS
limits the ability to carry out a disaggregated analysis of poverty and shared prosperity trends.
The most recent poverty assessments are outdated and do not capture the effects of the global
financial crisis. Overall, extreme poverty was lower in the Caribbean in 1999 than in the Latin
America and Caribbean (LAC) region and it fell by more than 2 percentage point over the last
decade. However, poverty declined faster in LAC, and the Caribbean economies are now lagging
behind the LAC average (Fig. 5).

12

OECS countries belong to the ECCU and share a common Central Bank, the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank
(ECCB). The regulatory framework of the domestic banking system has two main legislative components: (i) the
ECCB Agreement Act of 1983 and its amendments, which gives the ECCB the power to “regulate banking business
on behalf of and in collaboration with Participating Governments”; and (ii) the Banking Acts of the various
territories of the participating governments, which govern the regulation of banking business in those territories. The
harmonized Banking Acts recognize the ECCB as the ECCU’s Central Bank, with primary responsibility for the
supervision of domestic banks. The ultimate authority for regulating institutions covered by this Act is jointly vested
in the Minister of Finance and the ECCB. The Minister of Finance is normally required to act in consultation with,
and on the recommendation of, the ECCB with respect to areas in which the Minister has ultimate responsibility.
13
British American Insurance Company (BAICO) and CLICO International Life sold policies to ECCU credit
unions and banks, and total liabilities amounted to about 12 percent of the ECCU GDP.

14.
Official poverty rates vary from 18 to 38 percent (using each country’s national
poverty line). Latest poverty assessments (Fig. 6) show relatively small rates of extreme poverty,
but rates of moderate poverty are higher than would be suggested by OECS countries’ level of
income. By contrast, inequality (measured by the Gini coefficient) is low (ranging from 36.6 in
2008 in Grenada to 48 in 2006 in Antigua and Barbuda) compared to the LAC average of 52.9 in
2009. The majority of poor people are in rural areas, where a large part of the population lives,
and poverty is particularly prevalent among the indigenous population and female-headed
households.

15.
Unemployment has risen in most OECS countries in the aftermath of the global
financial crisis. Lower demand for OECS exports and services resulting from the 2008 crisis
exacerbated the already high pre-crisis levels of unemployment in most OECS countries (e.g.,
unemployment increased in St. Lucia from 14.7 percent in 2002 to 20.6 percent in 2012, and in
Grenada from 10.2 percent in 2001 to 29 percent in 2010 -Fig. 7). Unemployment is in general
higher among the poor, and reaches 35 percent of them in some OECS countries. Unemployment
is also higher among women (e.g., in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, male unemployment is
12.2 percent and female unemployment 26.2 percent).
16.
Youth unemployment is a source of particular concern. Available data suggest youth
unemployment levels ranging from 34 percent in St Lucia to 42 percent in Grenada (Fig. 7).
There is evidence that youth unemployment is higher among women (e.g., in St. Vincent and the
10

Grenadines, the male youth unemployment rate is 27.8 percent and the female youth
unemployment rate is 41.4 percent). The growing number of young adults who are neither at
school nor at work has a negative effect on labor force participation, crime, and other social
issues. 14

17.
While OECS countries have made overall progress in achieving the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs), challenges remain. Overall, human development indices are
relatively high in the OECS, which rank between 63 and 88 among the 186 states in the United
Nations Development Program’s Human Development Index. 15 16 Good progress has been
achieved on the education MDGs: enrollment in primary education ranges between 90 and 100
percent and in secondary education between 85 and 100 percent. The OECS is also on track for
achieving the MDGs related to maternal and child health by 2015. 17 However, no information is
available on the poverty MDG, and progress to reduce hunger by half (MDG1c) has been mixed
(see Table 3): while hunger is very low in St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Dominica, hunger
in Antigua and Barbuda and Grenada remains moderately high and has worsened over time; St.
Kitts and Nevis and St. Lucia have made some progress in reducing hunger but remain relatively
14

In the OECS, men’s experience of violence is generally linked to crime-, drug- and gang-related activities, while
women are more likely to be exposed to sexual, domestic, and intimate partner violence. UNODC’s sexdisaggregated data on homicide rates shows that in the subregion, males’ homicide rates are higher than females’,
ranging from 66.7 per 100,000 people in Antigua and Barbuda to 93.3 per 100,000 people in St. Lucia (compared to
33.3 and 6.7 per 100,000 people, respectively, for women).
15
World Bank, OECS Overview, 2013.
16
The production of timely and accurate national-level information on the MDGs has been challenging, leading to
incomplete aggregation of data. The OECS Commission is taking the lead, working with other partners (WB, CDB,
UNDP, UNICEF) on implementing the Sustainable Data Program for the Measurement of Living Conditions and
mainstreaming a Multidimensional Approach to Poverty Measurement in the OECS. This effort would have the
dual objective of regularly generating reliable data to monitor different micro-dimensions of poverty, and of
developing a new approach to national policy, planning, and development initiatives for the achievement of poverty
reduction goals in the subregion, while enabling the measurement of progress in achieving the post-MDGs agenda.
17
Under-five mortality (deaths of children per 100,000 live births) in the OECS has declined significantly since the
early 1990s; estimates from 2011 show that in the OECS countries this indicator ranged from 7.4 to 20.9, which is
considered “low mortality.” Maternal mortality rates—which range from 24 to 48 in 2010—are also low in the
OECS; however, it must be noted that data are available only for Grenada, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the
Grenadines.

Similarly, OECS countries have made significant progress in closing the gender
gaps in the last few decades, but challenges persist 18 (Table 4). Compared to the LAC region,
OECS countries do relatively well with regards to girl enrollment in primary schools (which is at
parity or close to parity with boys’), girls’ participation in tertiary education, and maternal
mortality. However, significant gender gaps remain, especially with regards to the labor market,
reproductive health, poverty, and parliamentary participation:
•

•

•

Education and employment. Girls generally outperform boys in the higher levels of
education, with almost twice as many young women enrolled in tertiary education as
young men. However, this does not translate into labor market opportunities: women
face lower labor market participation (e.g., in 2012, in St. Lucia and St Vincent and
the Grenadines, the female labor force participation was 62.6 percent and 55.7
percent, respectively, 19 compared to male labor force participation of 76 percent and
78.2 percent, respectively), lower wages, and higher unemployment rates than men
(see Table 4).
Reproductive health. The OECS is characterized by close to universal access to
prenatal care, births attended by skilled staff, and low maternal mortality rates.
However, women aged 15 to 24 are three to six times more likely to contract
HIV/AIDS than young men, and teenage pregnancy is a major concern: 40.3 percent
of women aged 15 to 49 in Grenada, and 42.2 percent of the same cohort in St. Kitts
and Nevis, had their first child by the age of 19. 20
Poverty. Women living in rural areas are particularly vulnerable to poverty because
they engage in unpaid domestic work, and as the limited job opportunities in rural
areas mean higher unemployment and lower income for them. Also, female-headed
households, which account for two-thirds of households, are more likely to be poor. 21

Parliamentary participation. In terms of women’s parliamentary participation, OECS
countries lag behind upper-middle-income country and LAC averages (22 percent and
25 percent respectively), with St. Kitts and Nevis farthest from the average at 7
percent and St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines closest at 17 percent.

Challenges for Poverty Reduction and Shared Prosperity

19.
Lack of macroeconomic sustainability and existing structural bottlenecks have
limited the OECS ability to grow faster, reduce poverty, and promote shared prosperity.
The low growth OECS countries have experienced over the last decades is partly due to a weak
macroeconomic framework and sluggish implementation of structural reforms. In addition,
OECS have experienced declining competitiveness, resulting both from structural cost
disadvantages (in part due to the OECS economies’ small sizes) and poor policy choices, which
have led to decreasing productivity, employment generation, and growth in key sectors.
Inefficiencies in the public sector have led to inflated fiscal imbalances and public debt, and poor
public services, putting a further drag on macroeconomic sustainability, growth, and poverty
reduction. Finally, high vulnerability to economic shocks and natural disasters has hampered
growth and affected OECS households, which are poorly equipped to manage the impact of
shocks and adapt to changing circumstances.

Weak Competitiveness
20.
Inadequate access to finance, investment climate, connectivity, electricity costs, use
of ICT, and innovation and entrepreneurship, affect the competitiveness of OECS
economies, leading to lower FDI, private sector (especially SME) investment, exports, and job
creation, and ultimately limiting growth, shared prosperity, and poverty reduction. The most
recent (2010) Enterprise Survey reveals that private firms consider that the lack of access to

13

finance is the single most important constraint to their development, followed by the lack of
affordable electricity, an inadequately trained work force, followed by specific concerns related
to the investment climate (Fig. 8).
Figure 8: Constraints to business success

Source: Enterprise Survey, 2010, WBG

21.
The financial sector, though large in terms of financial assets over GDP and number
of institutions, does not provide sufficient intermediation to support economic growth.
Financial system assets in the OECS represent 200 percent of regional GDP, on par with
countries with well-developed financial systems. The financial sector comprises 40 commercial
banks (14 domestic banks and 26 branches or subsidiaries of five foreign banks), 67 credit
unions, and 61 insurance companies (on a consolidated basis) (Table 5). However, many of the
institutions are small and offer a limited range of financial services. In particular, due to a
number of constraints (including investment climate, credit infrastructure, and creditor rights
constraints), banks provide mostly consumer loans and lines of credit to larger firms, and limited
services to SMEs. In addition, bank credit to the private sector has been declining over the last
five years 22 as stress on the financial sector has grown. Further, alternatives to credit are scarce
as capital markets, venture capital, leasing, and factoring are underdeveloped.
Table 5: OECS financial sector structure

22

From December 2008 to April 2014 (source: ECCB monetary survey).

14

22.
In addition to poor access to finance, there remains, despite good progress in
selected areas, constraints in the investment climate, which hurt small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) and FDI. While in general OECS countries rank well compared to their
Latin American peers with regards to investor protection, construction permits, the availability of
electricity, and regulations to start a business, severe constraints remain with regards to getting
credit, registering property, enforcing contracts, resolving insolvency, and, in some jurisdictions,
paying taxes (Fig. 9). Weaknesses in the investment climate penalize SMEs disproportionally,
but are also an obstacle to resume growth in FDIs. Enhancing growth and job creation will
require fostering faster development of the private sector, including through FDI and an
enhanced contribution of SMEs, which dominate the corporate sector in the OECS, with 96.3
percent of the total number of firms and 75.8 percent of employees and have thus a crucial role
to play to achieve a more inclusive growth (Table 6).

Competitiveness is also eroded by high logistics costs and poor transport
connectivity. A recent review suggests that OECS ports are relatively well developed and well
equipped, given their traffic, but that the cost of import and export movements is prohibitive. On
average, OECS import costs amount to US$2,000/container, four times more than in Singapore
(considered best practice) and 30 percent higher than in other Caribbean countries. Similarly,
export costs are twice as large as best practice in the world and 25 percent larger than in the rest
of the Caribbean and similar island states (i.e., Pacific Islands) 23 . For imports, the main driver of
costs is the cost of customs and document handling and for exports it is inefficient inland
transportation, which accounts for about 50 percent of export costs. Air transport is also a
challenge, as the inter-island system is not reliable and is not coordinated with larger
outside/international carriers 24. This seriously limits the development of stay-over tourism (as
opposed to cruise-based tourism), which represents a key growth opportunity for OECS
economies but would require better regional coordination of air transport systems and intraisland transportation.
24.
The cost of electricity in the OECS is among the highest in the world, creating an
additional constraint on competitiveness and poverty reduction. While the availability of
electricity is generally good, the cost of electricity if prohibitively expensive and a significant
constraint to the competitiveness of OECS economies and to shared prosperity. In 2011 the
average residential electricity tariffs in the OECS ranged from US$0.27 per kWh in St. Lucia to
US$0.41 in Dominica, compared to US$0.19 on average in LAC (Fig. 10). The high price of
electricity in the OECS largely reflects the high cost of producing electricity in systems that are
small, 25 isolated, and primarily dependent on expensive fuel oil (diesel and heavy fuel oil
accounted for 77-100 percent of electricity generation in 2011). This price has a sharp impact on
the competitiveness of key sectors, including tourism. 26 Moreover, pollution from the heavy use
of fuel oil affects the local environment (which in turn further affects tourism), and produces
greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. Electricity costs also cause hardship to
private consumers, particularly poor households, who can spend as much as 7-11 percent of their
income on electricity. 27 In addition, if the full cost of electricity supply is not passed on through
tariffs, the subsidies used to cover the gap undermine the financial stability of utilities and create
fiscal liabilities. Finally, OECS countries import all their oil, which exposes them to price and
supply shocks and enhances their economic vulnerability.

OECS countries do not seem to face a physical infrastructure challenge in the transport sector. They have a high
density of airports (seven international and four intercontinental) with a capacity of about 4 million passengers each
year. The proven demand is about 1 million tourists each year, and the aggregate population a little over 600,000.
The challenge is with the systems and regional coordination. By constrast, traffic within the OECS is cumbersome;
it is dominated by a monopolist air operator that controls schedules, characterized by the lack of interlining that
creates baggage losses and delays (among other things), and framed in old-fashioned immigration requirements
among OECS countries. Briceno-Garmendia et al. (2013), Connectivity for the OECS Countries: An Initial Step for
an Assessment of the Caribbean Connectivity, Paper Presented in the Regional Workshop of the CGF in the
Bahamas, June 2013.

The installed generation capacity in OECS islands ranged between 46 and 98MW in 2011. The total installed
capacity for the entire region is only 373 MW (vs., for example, 3,000 MW in the Dominican Republic only).

A charge for a guest night in a 50-100 room hotel includes an estimated US$14-18 in electricity costs, as each

However, the abundance of renewable energy sources (solar, wind, and geothermal)
in the OECS provides an opportunity. Dominica and St. Vincent and the Grenadines generate,
respectively, 23 percent and 12 percent of their electricity using hydropower, but other OECS
countries generate only 3 percent or less from renewables. Nonetheless, OECS countries have
the potential to better diversify their energy matrix through more renewables, thereby reducing
their dependence on imported fossil fuels, enhancing the reliability of their energy supply, and
lowering electricity costs over the long run. Achieving the appropriate balance of base-load
renewables, such as geothermal energy, and intermittent sources such as solar and wind power,
will be critical to meet future demand while enabling a decrease in electricity tariffs. Widespread
integration of renewable energy will require changes to the power sector business model and will
present challenges. Geothermal power, in particular, involves an initial high risk associated with
exploration and high up-front costs. However, when judiciously combined with measures to
enhance energy efficiency, greater use of multiple renewable energy alternatives can help boost
the region’s competitiveness and reduce its vulnerability to high and volatile fuel prices.
Increasing the provision of renewable energy is also important for maintaining a clean
environment, which is critical for sustaining tourism and improving health. Access to sustainable
sources of clean, reliable, and affordable energy will also enhance the provision of services,
including the operations of hospitals and schools.
26.
Higher reliance on ICT also has the potential to increase competitiveness in the
OECS. ICT connectivity remains weak in the OECS as a result of low broadband penetration,
limited competition, unfinished liberalization, and high prices for services and devices. While the
region is served by several fiber-optic submarine cables (overcapacity exists in many places),
there is no effective competition in the provision of international services. 28 The result is
28

In most countries, former incumbent operators still control international facilities, and cables are not subject to
open access regulatory regimes. Similar challenges exist at the national transmission levels, where there are few
competitors.

17

inequitable access to ICT, which constrains the region’s capacity to compete in the global
economy and its options to improve competitiveness, create jobs, explore digital industries
opportunities, and enhance public service delivery. However, OECS governments recognize that
ICT is a critical tool for improving competitiveness and service delivery, increasing citizens’
capacity to provide feedback to the authorities, and creating job and growth opportunities in
digital industries.
27.
Increased innovation and entrepreneurship are also needed to enhance
competitiveness. Innovation and entrepreneurship are limited in the OECS, as exemplified by
the percentages of firms that develop or introduce new products. This is particularly problematic
for OECS countries, whose main challenge is to foster job creation and economic growth, as
innovation and entrepreneurship play a crucial role in strengthening economic competitiveness.
Innovative entrepreneurs are indeed often the drivers that spur growth and competitiveness by
creating jobs and delivering new products, services, and business models to underserved
markets. 29 In this context, innovative growth enterprises can help address some of the most
significant social, environmental, and economic challenges of the OECS. For example, ICT
enterprises offer opportunities to promote youth employment and foster regional digital industry
development. Similarly, climate technology enterprises can help traditional industries, such as
tourism and agri-processing, to mitigate and adapt to climate change challenges and ensure
energy and resource efficiency. Unleashing the potential of innovation and entrepreneurship is
therefore critical to OECS’s economic integration and increased competitiveness (Fig. 11).

Low Productivity and Growth in Leading Industries
28.
Tourism is an important source of employment, economic activity, and growth in
the OECS. OECS countries have limited options for economic diversification because of the

29

See Global Competitiveness Report (2013-2014).

18

small size of their markets and their limited endowments 30 and tourism has been the main pillar
of their economic growth. While there are some differences across countries, the average total
economic contribution 31 of tourism for the six independent OECS countries has represented
roughly 60 percent of export earnings, 30 percent of GDP, and 30 percent of total employment
(Fig. 12). Tourism is also an important source of foreign exchange. A competitive and robust
tourism sector is thus critical to OECS economies, especially since the sector has significant
linkages to such other areas of economic activity as construction, agribusiness, and financial
services.
Figure 12: The total contribution of travel and tourism to GDP and employment (percent)

29.
While global demand for tourism has been evolving, tourism in the OECS continues
to rely on markets and products with lower growth or lower local benefits. In terms of
markets, the OECS countries have mostly relied on traditional tourist markets (the USA, Canada,
the UK, and the Caribbean). While there has been a very marginal growth in the North American
markets, the flow of tourists from the UK and the Caribbean has been shrinking since 2012.
OECS countries have been less successful in attracting tourists from Europe or countries fueling
growth in global tourism, including Brazil, Russia, India, and China. From a product perspective,
tourism in the OECS is dominated by cruise-based travel, while the development of stay-over
resort tourism represents one of the most important opportunities for OECS economies. Indeed,
OECS cruise visitors are between 2.5 and 3 times more numerous than stay-over visitors; yet
spending by stay-over tourists can be about ten times higher than that of cruise ship visitor. In
addition, tourism in OECS countries has been heavily dependent on all-inclusive resorts, a model
that has lower impacts on shared prosperity at the local level than such emerging tourism
segments as nature, eco-, and cultural tourism. Overall, while tourism is the lead economic sector
in the OECS countries, the share of OECS countries in international tourism is less than 0.2
percent of world tourism arrivals (Table 7). Even with respect to tourism in the wider Caribbean,
the OECS represent a market share of no more than 7 percent, a share that has been on the
decline over the last two decades.

30.
The recent OECS Common Tourism Policy provides an opportunity to expand into
growing tourism niches while creating greater linkages with local economies. The 2011
OECS Common Tourism Policy envisages tourism as an industry that is viable, internationally
competitive, and resilient. It identifies a large number of policy areas requiring work to improve
the region’s tourism competitiveness: redefining market niches and developing new products,
increasing community participation and sectoral linkages, better training the tourism workforce,
enhancing regional coordination, strengthening marketing at regional level, addressing access
and transportation issues, ensuring environmental and cultural sustainability, addressing crime
that involves visitors, and strengthening data collection and research. An enhanced focus on
tourism destinations and attracting visitors to authentic places would enable the OECS to tap into
this fastest-growing tourism market, with high labor intensity and deep linkages with local
communities. Doing so would provide more stable employment opportunities and promote
greater shared prosperity (a high share of tourism employment (75 percent) is indeed typically
for unskilled or semi-skilled labor, and tourism-related labor is highly inclusive of women,
youth, and marginalized social groups) 32.
31.
In addition, strengthening the tourism sector’s linkages with other sectors, such as
agribusiness, would multiply the growth and job creation spillover effects. Since 2000, the
decline in the production and export of sugar and bananas has meant a dramatic decline in
agriculture’s contribution to GDP in the OECS 33. More recently, data gathered by the Eastern
Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) reveals a modest upward trend in the sector’s contribution to
regional GDP, from 2.93 percent in 2007 to 3.2 percent in 2011, with about 3.5 percent projected
for 2014, resulting from an increased contribution of nontraditional crops—from 1.77 percent of
GDP in 2007 to 2.01 percent in 2011. Further efforts to support resumption in the growth of
32

In general, women are overrepresented as employees in the service sector in the LAC region, and particularly so in
the Caribbean. For example, data from Antigua and Barbuda (2010) indicate that 93.8 percent of all female
employees are in the service sector.

agriculture could have a significant impact on shared prosperity, especially in rural areas, as
many smallholders would stand to gain. It addition, it could yield significant economic benefits,
especially by reducing hotels’ dependence on imports. According to a survey conducted in 2008
by the World Bank Group with hotels, cruise lines and marinas in the region, while most hotels
procure services locally, very few purchase local agricultural goods, as local production is
neither competitive nor large enough to accommodate hotels´ demand. According to this survey,
only 32 percent of tourism food demand is currently sourced locally 34. Separately, based on a
2011 study, 89 percent of meat, 81 percent of dairy products, and 41 percent of fruits and
vegetables consumed by the region’s tourism sector are imported.
32.
To reap the benefits of stronger linkages between agribusiness and tourism, the
OECS needs to improve the productivity of the agribusiness value chain. Revenue
generation in agriculture has been compromised by sensitive ecosystems, vulnerability to climate
shocks and climate change, historical dependence on a few key export commodities, and
dependence on food imports. To address these challenges, it is necessary to link producers and
processors to markets, provide incentives for the adoption of improved technologies to make
crops more resilient and productive, and improve skills at the farm level (with a focus on small
farmers) to enable farmers to increase productivity, comply with standards and adapt to markets,
and be better prepared to deal with climate change and natural disasters. While such reforms may
take time to generate their full impact, their spillover effects on poverty reduction can be large.
33.
Stronger links between tourism and agriculture could benefit the poorest segments
of the population, who mostly live in rural areas. Currently, all the OECS countries are net
food importers, and the negative trade balance has been growing since the late 1990s. According
to a survey of hotels, cruise lines, and marinas, only 32 percent of tourism food demand is
currently sourced locally. Ensuring that more goods and services in the tourism supply chain
come from local sources would help maximize the proportion of tourism spending that is
retained in local communities, and would involve the poor in the supply process. Creating a
stronger link between tourism and agribusiness could facilitate this and help reduce foreign
exchange leakage for food purchases.

Inefficient Public Sector
34.
Public sector modernization would help the OECS countries enhance their fiscal
and debt sustainability, improve the provision of public services, and leverage private
investments. Greater efforts need to be done across the OECS to implement structural reforms
and establish the foundations of a sound macroeconomic framework. Reducing fiscal deficits and
public debt levels are a priority to create the fiscal space needed to support growth-enhancing
investments, conduct countercyclical policies, and mitigate the impact of shocks. Doing this
requires improving public financial management (PFM), fiscal management, and debt
management. At the same time, increased institutional capacity and better management of
government institutions would enable more effective delivery of public services, increased
capacity for public-private partnerships (PPPs) and greater leverage of private investment in
infrastructure and service provision.
35.
OECS governments are committed to implement fiscal consolidation measures to
reduce fiscal deficits and promote sound and prudent debt management. Recognizing that
34

World Bank, 2008.

21

the accumulation of debt pulls resources away from more productive uses, 35 OECS governments
have indicated (in the OECS Growth and Development Strategy and in the ECCB Eight Point
Stabilization and Growth Program) their desire to reach, by 2020, the debt-to-GDP ratio of 60
percent recommended by the ECCB, through a combination of measures to enhance fiscal
discipline and growth performance.
36.
Public administration systems need modernization to generate enough fiscal gains to
enhance the sustainability of public finances and improve the delivery of public services.
While several OECS countries have engaged into public sector modernization efforts, PFM
should generally be further strengthened to increase links between planning and budgeting,
improve cash management by taking advantage of information generated by integrated financial
management information systems, reduce manual processes in treasury administration (using, for
instance, a Treasury Single Account system), integrate systems (e.g., tax, customs, budget, debt
management), and enhance the supervision of state-owned enterprises in terms of corporate
governance and fiscal risks. Improving statistical capacity to collect data and monitor the impact
of governments’ and development partners’ programs, particularly on poverty and shared
prosperity, is also a priority36.
37.
Greater use of PPPs provides an opportunity to improve the delivery of key services
and fill in key infrastructure needs. Across the region, boosting economic growth, shared
prosperity, and resilience will require meeting significant infrastructure and social investment
needs. Driven by a combination of tight fiscal constraints and growing appreciation of the role of
the private sector in delivering public services, OECS governments are increasingly considering
PPPs to meet those needs. The recent “Caribbean Infrastructure PPP Roadmap” found a current
pipeline of 14 potential PPPs. When selected, structured, and managed well, PPPs can help make
the best use of the financial and technical resources of the public and private sectors to provide
improved infrastructure assets and services. To do so however, it is critical to increase capacity
in the public administration to manage such partnerships, including at regional level, as well as
to prepare potential projects to best international standards.

Social Vulnerabilities
38.
While access to social services is strong in the OECS, structural weaknesses affect
the effectiveness of these services and expose large social vulnerabilities. OECS countries
provide a range of safety net programs and labor market interventions. But while safety net
programs and spending levels are in line with global averages, the programs suffer from high
fragmentation and duplication, spending inefficiencies, capacity deficiencies, targeting
inadequacies, and limited ability to respond to exogenous shocks. These factors hamper the
effectiveness of social protection spending, limit coverage, and restrict impact on human capital
development. Overall, the systems have proven largely insufficient to facilitate resilience and
protect vulnerable populations during the economic crisis.
39.
Despite universal education coverage, education quality is weak and learning
achievements are low. Large segments of the population leave the education system with
limited skills. For instance, the percentage of students passing five or more Caribbean Secondary
35

Development” in Business, Finance and Economics in Emerging Economies 2(1).

22

Education Certificate subjects, including English and mathematics, ranges from only 20 percent
in Grenada and St. Vincent and the Grenadines to 35 percent in Dominica. In 2011, 67 percent of
students achieved grades I-III in English, and 35 percent achieved the same grade range in
mathematics. 37 In addition, the skills generated by the education system do not meet labor
market expectations and the lack of adequate skills is cited as a top constraint by firms (Fig. 9).38
In the OECS fewer than half of mathematics and English teachers, and fewer than 20 percent of
science teachers, are qualified to teach their subjects 39 . The lack of teaching and learning
standards and weak school-level leadership contribute to the poor quality of education.
Improving education quality and outcomes in the OECS would go a long way to enhance the
employability of the workforce and support job creation and growth. Evidence shows indeed that
a difference of one standard deviation in test scores between countries equates to roughly two
percentage points in annual long-term GDP growth. Better education would also contribute to
greater shared prosperity, as children from poorer households perform worse than their richer
peers in school.
40.
Noncommunicable diseases also place a heavy economic burden on households and
the economy, slowing growth, increasing human vulnerability, weakening resilience, and
affecting the productivity of the workforce. As a result, OECS households are poorly equipped to
profit from opportunities, adapt to changing circumstances, and manage the impact of shocks.
About 70 percent of years of life lost in the OECS are due to noncommunicable diseases
(NCDs), a much higher rate than either the global average (50 percent) or the average for lowand middle-income countries in the Americas (60 percent). Moreover, the burden of NCDs falls
most heavily on the poor, taking a greater toll on their already low incomes (e.g., poorer
households in St. Lucia spend 48 percent of their per capita expenditure on health care, while
better-off households spend less than 20 percent), lowering their productivity, and compromising
their chances of moving out of poverty. There is also a gender dimension to NCDs, as risk
factors affect men and women differently: 40 NCDs also represent a heavy fiscal burden (e.g.,
Antigua and Barbuda spends US$2.4 million a year on health care for diabetics, and St. Vincent
and the Grenadines, US$1.8 million).

Grades I-III indicate a comprehensive to fairly good grasp of the key concepts, knowledge, skills, and abilities

According to the Pan American Health Organization (2011), “Non Communicable Diseases in the Americas:
Basic Indicators 2011”. Washington DC: PAHO, the prevalence of obesity is high among women in the OECS
countries, whereas hypertension, alcohol consumption and tobacco use generally affect more men There is not a
uniform trend in the OECS countries in terms of whether there is a higher premature mortality rate (under age of 70
per 100,000 population) due to cerebrovascular disease and diabetes among men as compared to women. However,
the OECS averages show that men are more likely to die prematurely from cerebrovascular disease (19.9, as
compared to 9.8 among women), while women are more likely to die prematurely from diabetes than men (28.1 and
20.2, respectively).

23

Vulnerability to Climate Change
41.
OECS countries are among the countries in the world that are most exposed to
natural hazards in terms of GDP and population at risk. Climate-related hazards are more
common than earthquakes in the region. Major climatic hazards include strong winds and heavy
rains often associated with the annual formation of tropical depressions, storms, and hurricanes,
causing floods and landslides. 41.The region is also at significant risk of storm surges, drought,
and volcanic eruptions. Ground-shaking, liquefaction, tsunamis, and landslides—harder to
forecast—occur with little or no warning, often resulting in significant loss of life and structural
damage. Most of the buildings in the region were not built to appropriate seismic-resistant
standards, so a large earthquake event could also have catastrophic consequences. Between 1993
and 2012, average OECS annual losses from natural disasters reached 4.3 percent of GDP (Fig.
13). Single events can have devastating impacts on OECS economies (Fig. 13). For example,
Hurricane Ivan (2004) damages amounted to over 200 percent of Grenada’s GDP, and Hurricane
George (1998) caused damages amounting to 140 percent of St. Kitts and Nevis’s GDP. The
frequency and impact of natural disasters have been growing in OECS countries (Fig. 14),
increasing vulnerabilities significantly.

For instance, on December 24, 2013, a brief tropical storm in St. Vincent and the Grenadines and St. Lucia
produced extraordinarily intense rainfall at a time that was well outside the traditional hurricane season. Over a
three-hour period, St. Vincent and the Grenadines received 278 millimeters (mm) of rain and St. Lucia 224 mm.
Total damages were assessed at approximately 15 and 7 percent, respectively, of the GDP of the two countries.

Vulnerability to natural disasters affects OECS growth and prosperity prospects
significantly. The average annual losses incurred by OECS countries from extreme weather
events range from about one percent of GDP in St Vincent and the Grenadines to a very high
nine percent in Grenada (Fig. 15). Similarly, average annual life losses are very significant
across the region. Such losses create a significant challenge for OECS governments as they
endeavor to create sustained economic growth and prosperity. Therefore, enhanced disaster risk
resilience is fundamental for the OECS to ensure sustainable and inclusive growth.

43.
Going forward, increased threats to marine and coastal resources in the OECS may
have further negative effects on tourism and growth. The natural resource base, the engine
that drives tourism and fosters private sector growth and jobs in the OECS, is at risk as oceans
become dumping grounds for industrial and urban solid waste and sewerage, agricultural run-off,
and marine-based pollution (e.g., sewage from yachts). Other factors, such as ocean temperature
increases that are due to climate change and point source pollution, have also had a marked
destructive impact on these resources. The result, highly visible to tourists, is a noticeable
decline in marine life, degraded corals, and declining fish varieties and stock. A degraded marine
base could seriously affect tourism and other sectors of the economy, and highlights the
importance of promoting a sustainable ocean-based (blue) economy in the OECS.

25

2. NATIONAL AND REGIONAL VISIONS
44.
The OECS governments recognize the fundamental challenge of resuming growth
and competitiveness in the region. In their national development strategies, OECS countries
acknowledge the importance of addressing the persistently high unemployment rate, especially
among youth. They also mention the importance of addressing their vulnerability to economic
and natural shocks. They recognize fiscal deficits and high debt levels as the main constraint for
governments’ action. The weaknesses of both the financial sector and the current business
environment are major concerns. Tourism, agriculture, ICT, and energy are recognized as the
main drivers of future growth. The OECS countries emphasize the importance of modernizing
the state and developing effective social protection systems, and they agree that better-quality
education and appropriate skills are needed to meet job market demands.
45.
The OECS regional vision is anchored on the Revised Treaty of Basseterre (June
2010), establishing the OECS Economic Union, and the OECS Growth and Development
Strategy. The Treaty led to the creation of a single financial and economic space within which
goods, people, and capital move freely; monetary and fiscal policies are harmonized; and
countries take a common approach to trade, health, education and environment, as well as to the
development of critical sectors such as agriculture, tourism, and energy. The 2012 OECS Growth
and Development Strategy provides directions for the region’s development over the next ten
years. Its key objectives are to achieve economic transformation, growth, employment, poverty
reduction and better human development, with a focus on structural reforms geared towards
boosting private investment and productivity, recognizing in particular the role that tourism,
creative industries, ICT, education and health, and environment management can play. In 2013,
an OECS Growth and Development Strategy Action Plan outlined short, medium, and long-term
activities in the areas of tourism, agriculture and the creative industries among others. In 2014,
the Director General of the OECS Commission presented a new OECS regional vision, based on
three pillars: (i) consolidation of the institutional architecture of the union; (ii) facilitation of the
free movement of people and capital; and (iii) security and well-being of OECS citizens, founded
on an effective job creation strategy across the single economic space.
46.
This Regional Partnership Strategy (RPS) is consistent with the strategic directions
of the OECS Growth and Development Strategy and relevant national and regional OECS
policies, strategies, and papers 42. The RPS also takes into account the vision expressed by the
Governor of the ECCB and developed in two main documents (i.e., the “8 Point Stabilization and
Growth Plan” of 2009 and “Challenges to ECCU Stability and Growth” of 2013), which identify
the major challenges faced by the OECS in the aftermath of the global financial crisis and
propose a focus on four key areas: i) financial stability, ii) debt management, iii) fiscal reforms,
and iv) growth and competitiveness.
42

For example, at the regional level: the OECS Common Tourism Policy (OECS Commission, 2011); the OECS
Education Strategy (OECS Commission, 2013); A Framework for Regional Growth and Development in
CARICOM (CARICOM, 2013); Structural Change for Equality: An Integrated Approach to development (ECLAC,
2012). At the national level: National Economic and Social Transformation Plan (Antigua and Barbuda, 2009);
Growth and Social Protection Strategy 2014-18 (Commonwealth of Dominica, 2014); Growth and Poverty
Reduction Strategy 2012-16 (Grenada, 2012); Adaptation Strategy in Response to the new Sugar Regime 2006-13
(St. Kitts and Nevis, 2006); Medium term Development Strategic Plan 2012-16 (St. Lucia, 2011); and the National
Economic and Social Development Plan 2013-2025 (St. Vincent and the Grenadines, 2013). See also Annex VIII,

3. WORLD BANK GROUP PARTNERSHIP
A. Lessons Learned from the Previous RPS
47.
Lessons resulting from the Completion Report of the OECS RPS for 2010-14 have
been incorporated into the design of this RPS. The RPS for 2010-2014 was implemented
under difficult circumstances as the stagnation brought about by the continued sluggish global
economy, the scarcity of readily available opportunities to diversify, and recurrent natural
disasters placed the OECS economies under stress. The World Bank Group (WBG) responded by
increasing attention to such issues as economic growth and employment, sustainability, the
financial sector, and energy. Overall, delivery of the program met expectations, but because of
some partial shortfalls, the Completion Report rated the RPS’s contribution to development
outcomes as moderately satisfactory. The new RPS builds on the efforts of the previous strategy.
The following are key lessons learned from the implementation of the RPS 2010-14 that have
been taken into consideration in designing the new strategy:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Objectives set under the RPS should be aligned with the capacity of the WBG program to
deliver (available instruments and capacity to influence results);
The RPS results framework must reflect as accurately as possible the outcomes and impact of
the program (i.e., scope of engagement and achievements);
The RPS support for regional integration through a combination of regional work and
country-level interventions worked well and should be further enhanced;
A regional perspective would enhance opportunities for the IFC to contribute to growth and
inclusion, bringing to bear the IFC’s innovative practices, expertise, and finance;
Flexibility to respond to evolving circumstances through innovative products or activities is
critical (e.g., Comprehensive Debt Framework, Caribbean Growth Forum);
Caribbean countries have found it difficult to undertake reforms in the past, often because of
political economy factors; and
Selectivity can help improve focus and delivery of results.

B. Consultations
48.
This RPS draws on extensive strategic consultations with different partners and
stakeholders. In-depth consultations were conducted with governments and representatives of
the private sector (including through the OECS Business Council) and civil society, both incountry and in Washington, DC. 43 Bilateral and multilateral partners, as well as the OECS
Commission and the ECCB, were also extensively consulted at different times in the process. A
Client Survey was carried out in the OECS 44 in 2013, and its results were taken into account in
designing the strategy. The RPS also capitalizes on the wide-reaching participatory process of
the Caribbean Growth Forum (CGF), which informs programming in the areas of skills and
productivity, investment climate, and logistics 45.
43

Specifically, representatives of the private sector and civil society organizations have been consulted on this RPS
in Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.

See Annex IX on the results of the Client Survey conducted in Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, and St.
Vincent and the Grenadines.

49.
Stakeholders support the proposed RPS framework and its objectives. There was
broad agreement on giving priority to activities that could help lay the foundations for growth
and competitiveness and stimulate job creation in the OECS countries. Stakeholders also agreed
that particular attention should be paid to the role and soundness of the financial sector, and
public sector modernization is also high among their priorities. In addition, attention to social
safety nets and disaster risk management were requested to enhance OECS’s resilience.

C. Country and Regional Engagement
50.
This RPS applies a systematic filtering process to define relevant areas of
engagement. Four filters have been used: (i) client demand and commitment; (ii) “line of sight”
to the twin corporate goals; (iii) potential to achieve highest impact in the OECS, in line with the
diagnostic presented above, and (iv) WBG comparative advantage. 46 The RPS also takes into
account the assistance provided by other development partners.
51.
The OECS Regional Partnership Strategy (RPS) for FY15-19 is consistent with the
holistic approach adopted by the OECS Governments to tackle the long-standing issues of
low growth and debt sustainability. The OECS countries acknowledge the multifaceted nature
of their challenges and have Figure 16: Comprehensive Debt Framework (CDF)

considering that improvements in

the request of the Heads of

Structured around four pillars, the
Resilience to Natural

Disaster
(CDF) is designed to address the
interdependent structural causes of
high debt and low growth in small island states by (i) promoting private-sector led growth, (ii)
strengthening fiscal management, (iii) building resilience to natural disasters, and (iv) improving
debt management. The CDF is the context in which the Bank undertakes its dialogue with the
OECS and defines its assistance program.

CDF

52.
As there is merit in seeking greater regional integration but implementation of
regional programs has proven difficult, the RPS will support country programs under
regional frameworks. For the OECS, the greatest benefits from economic integration will come
46

Comparative advantage was defined as measuring the WBG’s global experience, its analytic understanding, and
the success of its engagement in a given area.

28

from taking advantage of economies of scale, sharing risk, generating cross-country spillovers,
rationalizing the provision of public services, eliminating duplication of administrative
structures, and better representing the region in international fora. Achieving economies of scale
will also allow IFC and MIGA to play a stronger development role and increase opportunities for
investment in the OECS. However, despite recent efforts towards regional integration, progress
has been uneven. This RPS proposes a systematic, yet pragmatic, approach to regional
integration by offering individual countries a menu of options under a regional operation
framework; this arrangement will foster regional approaches in critical areas and has potential to
generate cross-country spillovers, while allowing countries to select the mix that suits their
priorities best and tailor support for reforms to their needs, for greatest ownership and
effectiveness. Accordingly, the Bank will prepare regional programs supporting regional
approaches where suitable, and implemented through tailored country-level loans, using
Investment Project Financing for “Series of Projects”.
53.
The proposed engagement model aims at maximizing impact by leveraging a
tailored package of WBG financial, knowledge, and convening services, including a
strategic use of trust funds. To build knowledge in areas critical to the RPS objective, analytic
and advisory activities (AAA) will support each area of lending engagement. In each objective
area, support will be provided by the Bank, IFC, and MIGA as relevant and feasible. 47 MIGA
and, to some extent, IFC currently acknowledge limited opportunities for engagement because of
the small size of the OECS markets. They will, however, endeavor to seek potential
opportunities for engagement, possibly at regional level. In high-income OECS countries
(Antigua and Barbuda and St. Kitts and Nevis), the Bank will move toward a model that is
increasingly based on reimbursable advisory services. Trust funds will be sought to complement
the limited IDA/IBRD envelope and enable more effective results in each area of engagement.
54.
Gender, environmental, and institutional capacity considerations are critical and
will be mainstreamed in activities, where relevant. As relevant, WBG interventions will
include a gender perspective to enhance the development outcomes. Concerns about
environmental sustainability will be mainstreamed throughout the program, as will capacitybuilding efforts. Indeed, much of the program seeks not only the delivery of specific sector
outcomes, but also the building of capacity and institutions to sustain achievements over the long
haul.

D. Proposed World Bank Group FY15-19 Partnership Strategy
55.
The overall strategic goal of this RPS is to support the OECS in laying foundations
for sustainable inclusive growth. To pursue this high-level objective, the RPS activities are
organized around three areas of engagement; all ranked as high priorities by governments and
stakeholders: competitiveness, public sector modernization, and resilience (Fig. 17).

47

St. Vincent and the Grenadines is the only OECS country that is not also a member of IFC.

56.
The proposed RPS program is aligned with the WBG Strategy and the twin
corporate goals of reducing extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity. Establishing a
sound investment climate, including ICT and transport connectivity and lowering the cost of
electricity, would help eliminating obstacles to growth and private sector development, and
attracting FDI, which are all necessary to create jobs and new sources of wealth. Strengthening
the financial system would help reducing fiscal risk, for governments with limited fiscal space
and rising debt, and potential negative spillovers on the most vulnerable. The limited capacity of
the financial system to support private sector development is an obstacle to investments and
growth. A more efficient public sector would reduce unnecessary fiscal costs and support private
sector development. Improved quality of public services would positively affect the well-being
of the poor and vulnerable. The poor would also benefit from less fragmented, better designed
social assistance systems. Moreover, social vulnerability would be reduced with stronger
education systems with higher quality and able to equip the population with the necessary skills
to enter the job market effectively. Finally, better capacity to manage natural disasters would
lead to significant reduction in human and economic losses.
Competitiveness
57.
The RPS includes activities aimed at increasing private participation in the economy
through a more effective business environment and increased competitiveness in leading
industries. In this regard, the WBG plans to implement both “horizontal” and “vertical”
interventions. Horizontal actions refer to economy wide reforms aimed at enhancing the overall
enabling environment for businesses across sectors (e.g., interventions to enhance access to
finance, improve the investment climate, encourage adoption of ICT, support innovation, and
decrease the cost of electricity). Vertical actions aim at unleashing the competitiveness potential
of leading sectors of the economy, particularly tourism and agriculture.
30

Outcome 1: Improved investment climate
58.
A better investment climate will improve conditions for private investment, FDI,
SMEs, and higher productivity. Removing weaknesses in the investment climate should have a
positive impact on firms, including on their ability to invest and grow. SMEs, which typically
suffer more from investment climate barriers, stand to gain significantly, and, as they are the
main generators of employment in the OECS, their benefiting from reforms of the investment
climate should have a positive impact on employment. A better investment climate is also a
requisite to reverse the trend of decreasing FDI. Finally, constraints in the investment climate
increase the costs of doing business, so that their removal will contribute to increasing
productivity in key sectors.
59.
The WBG will continue to support efforts to remove key weaknesses in the
investment climate, with a specific focus on areas where the OECS countries rank low relative
to countries at a similar level of per capita income or in the region, and are thus handicapped to
compete regionally and globally, such as for getting credit, registering property, enforcing
contracts, resolving insolvency, paying taxes, and improving logistics 48. Country-specific action
plans stemming from the CGF process will provide the basis for identifying needed reforms. The
WBG, working in coordination with the OECS Business Council, will support implementation of
these action plans.
60.
A strengthened banking system is necessary to support the development of the
private sector. Given the dominance of bank credit and the lack of other instruments to finance
productive activities, the curb on lending resulting from bank balance sheet weaknesses has left
firms and individuals with limited financial resources to leverage internal funds for investment,
in turn limiting growth of the private sector and the creation of jobs. A well-functioning and
diversified financial sector is also necessary to maintain economic stability; efficiently mobilize
domestic and external savings; and ensure the efficient allocation of capital to productive
investments, housing, and infrastructure, thereby supporting growth of the private sector and the
economy49.
61.
The WBG will support the development and implementation of a comprehensive
strategy to support the financial system. A comprehensive approach to strengthening the
banking sector and developing the financial sector is essential, given the OECS’s commitment to
a single financial space and the opportunity to generate economies of scale in a fragmented
market. The Bank will support the ECCB in developing a comprehensive financial sector
strategy aimed at strengthening the health of the banking sector and its ability to support the
development of the private sector and economic growth, while ensuring macro sustainability. An
operation to support the financial sector strengthening could materialize in the context of
adequate progress on developing a comprehensive OECS financial sector strategy - in
collaboration with the IMF, the ECCB and the CDB - and under a suitable policy and regulatory
48

Ongoing WBG advisory support for selected investment climate reforms include (i) facilitate business entry of
firms in Dominica and St Lucia; (ii) facilitate application process for construction permits in Dominica; (iii)
establish framework for the operation of a collateral registry in St Lucia; (iv) automate the clearance of imports and
build capacity of border agencies in Dominica, Grenada, St Lucia, St Kitts and Nevis; (v) support the establishment
of a commercial chamber/commercial court in St Lucia; (vi) provide support to simplify tax administration in
Antigua and Barbuda; and (vii) improve the framework for resolving insolvency in Dominica and St Lucia.

31

environment. The IFC will seek to support development of the financial sector where private
sector investment may be mobilized.
62.
To enhance productivity, competitiveness, and employment, the RPS will also
support greater adoption of ICT, innovation, and growth of creative industries. The RPS
program will support increased access to regional broadband networks and the development of
an ICT-enabled services industry in the OECS. Thus, the Bank will continue implementing the
Caribbean Regional Communication Infrastructure Project (CARCIP), endeavoring to extend it
to other OECS countries. 50 In collaboration with InfoDev (through the Entrepreneurship Program
for Innovation in the Caribbean, or EPIC), 51 the WBG will help foster entrepreneurship through
the development of a dynamic innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem, including supportive
public policies, public and privately funded incubators, training, and exchange of knowledge.
Building on the successful experience of Digital Jam 3.0 “Caribbean edition” in Jamaica, where
OECS countries were invited to participate, the WBG, in collaboration with various development
partners, will support the development of creative industries (e.g., animation industry). This
work will help increase youth employability and entrepreneurship, and create opportunities for
jobs, especially for young women and men, in the virtual global economy and in creative sectors.
63.
Finally, the RPS will support activities aimed at contributing to more predictable
and lower energy prices to enhance competitiveness and inclusion. The Bank will support
enhanced efficiency in the supply of and demand for electricity. It will also support diversifying
the energy supply away from fossil fuels, realizing, however, that significant impact will require
work extending beyond the RPS period. Therefore the objective during the RPS is to set the
groundwork and, when ready, to commence work in this area, beginning with the preparation of
geothermal development roadmaps in OECS countries, including Dominica and St. Lucia. To do
this, the WBG will mobilize technical assistance resources (e.g., from the Energy Sector
Management Assistance Program ESMAP, SIDS DOCK, the Global Environment Facility GEF),
in coordination with other development partners. In addition, the Bank will continue
implementing the Eastern Caribbean Energy Regulatory Authority Project (ECERA) to develop
a strengthened energy regulatory environment, and will endeavor to extend it to other OECS
countries 52.
Outcome 2: Increased tourism benefits with stronger linkages to agribusiness
64.
Revitalizing the tourism sector and establishing stronger linkages with
agribusinesses will contribute to resumption in employment and growth in the OECS.
Resumed growth in tourism, the main economic driver in the OECS, is expected to have a
spillover effect on other sectors (e.g., agriculture) in terms of economic growth and job creation.
This would be particularly the case with growth of tourism segments that have strong linkages to
local culture, are associated with the highest labor intensity, and are highly inclusive of women,
50

CARCIP Phase 1 was approved in May 2012 with Grenada (US$10m IDA), St. Lucia (US$6m IDA) and St.
Vincent and the Grenadines (US$6m IDA). At the end of 2013, Antigua and Barbuda expressed its intention to join
CARCIP. However, a new Government is in place after the June 2014 elections and the interest has to be confirmed.
51
The EPIC program is a 7-year program funded by the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade, and
Development (DFATD) and implemented by the WBG, with three components: (i) support to and expansion of the
Caribbean network of business enablers (including women entrepreneurs); (ii) skills upgrading and capacity
development; and (iii) innovative access to finance program for entrepreneurs.
52
Grenada and St. Lucia are the only OECS countries that are currently part of ECERA, which is implemented by
the OECS Commission.

youth, and marginalized social groups. Stronger links between tourism and agriculture will
benefit small holders and those living in rural areas, who are among the poorest segments of the
population. In addition, the development of agriculture will contribute to reducing food imports
and improving the current account balance.
65.
The WBG will support a comprehensive set of measures to enhance the
competiveness of tourism and create stronger linkages with agribusinesses. The Bank will
support the removal of obstacles to the sector’s development, including those related to policies,
regulation, infrastructure, and logistics. It will also foster linkages between the two sectors, so
that the tourism industry increasingly provides a market for small agribusinesses. This will be
achieved in part by strengthening selected value chains. Emphasis will be placed on developing
productive alliances in rural areas and enhancing the quality and standards infrastructure.
Capacity development of female entrepreneurs and insertion of female-led enterprises in these
alliances will be supported. Attention will be given to increasing the availability of productivityenhancing technologies (e.g., seeds, weather insurance, improved farming practices, training) for
agriculture. Productive alliances will not only link producer organizations to national markets
(including tourism), but will also link and strengthen productive alliances with exporters and
importers overseas for products where the OECS countries have comparative advantages, such as
nutmeg and other spices, quality cocoa or some tropical fruits. Investments could be supported in
cold chains and food safety systems. Air and maritime connectivity issues, which limit both
tourism and agriculture, may also be addressed (including the feasibility of a ferry system),
depending on economic feasibility, the availability of additional donor funding, and political
appetite. In addition, through an ongoing operation, 53 the WBG will continue supporting better
management of marine resources in the OECS, which will also help to boost tourism, although
recognizing that long-term efforts will be needed in this area, given the degree of degradation of
marine and coastal resources. Measures supporting the promotion of a sustainable ocean-based
(blue) economy in the OECS could also lead to positive spillovers.
Public Sector Modernization
66.
The WBG will support more effective and transparent public administrations, more
robust institutional capacity and stronger frameworks for partnership with the private
sector. The RPS will concentrate efforts in three areas: (i) assisting OECS governments to build
more efficient and accountable public administrations, focusing on the processes and systems
that will enhance the efficiency of the public administration and enable the fiscal gains that are
needed to enhance the sustainability of public finances; (ii) strengthening statistical capacity to
inform policymaking, and (iii) strengthening the framework for PPPs to enable OECS
governments to partner with the private sector to meet critical infrastructure investment needs.
The Bank will also continue to build institutional capacity in the public sector by incorporating
institutional capacity-building components in lending operations, and the Bank will explore the
possibility to support the adoption of harmonized Procurement Acts and developing supporting
regulations and institutional processes in the OECS.

53

The Sustainable Financing and Management of Eastern Caribbean Marine Ecosystem Project established the
Caribbean Biodiversity Fund, with a current capitalized endowment of approximately US$15 million from
GEF/World Bank, the German Development Bank, and the Nature Conservancy.

33

Outcome 3: Improved budget management and transparency
67.
With significant fiscal imbalances impeding government’s ability to allocate
resources to needed investments and programs, establishing the basis for sound fiscal
management is essential in the OECS. Introducing strategic budgeting tools, such as rolling
forward budget estimates and multiannual budget ceilings, is critical to lay the foundations for
better fiscal management, as these tools will contribute to inform decision on additional spending
request and savings options. In the long term, more efficient public administrations and increased
institutional capacity will help free up resources to deliver better services and strengthen macro
sustainability.
68.
The WBG will support selected country efforts to enhance the processes and systems
that contribute to better budget processes and greater transparency. It is expected that
Antigua and Barbuda, St. Kitts and Nevis, and Grenada will, with support from the Bank,
gradually introduce program budgeting and make available to the public information on planning
and budget outruns 54. In these three countries, the Bank will also support the creation of an Open
Budget Index through the implementation of the Open Data Initiative. These efforts will be
complemented by assistance provided under the Supporting Economic Management in the
Caribbean (SEMCAR) 55 program and the Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance Center
(CARTAC), 56 in close coordination with the EU and the IMF. The Bank will also continue
working with the Supreme Audit Institutions and Public Accounts Committees of Parliaments in
the OECS areas as well as on accounting and auditing standards. Finally, the Bank will support
greater accountability by leveraging the opportunity provided by the CGF process and the Global
Partnership for Social Accountability (GPSA) for the five OECS countries that have joined the
program 57.
Outcome 4: Strengthened statistical capacity
69.
Solid statistics are critical to inform policy decision making and monitor the impact
of policy decisions. Priority will be given to social and poverty statistics that allow timely
poverty and inclusion assessments and the assessment of the impacts of policy measures on
poverty and shared prosperity. In coordination with other partners, the WBG will support,
through no lending activities, the production of harmonized household surveys and capacity
building in key national and regional institutions (e.g., national statistical offices, OECS
Commission, Living Standards Measurement Committee) 58. A plan to strengthen OECS statistics
54
This will be achieved through the ongoing A&B Public and Social Sector Transformation Project; through an
ongoing Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant in St. Kitts and Nevis; and through the development of a policy
loan series in Grenada.
55
The SEMCAR Program, initiated with funding from DFATD, is managed by the World Bank and implemented in
partnership with the IMF. Its strategic objective is to improve economic management, regional integration, and
competitiveness in 12 Caribbean countries by contributing to more efficient, effective, accountable and regionally
integrated tax, customs, and PFM institutions, policies, processes, and ICT systems. Also, it includes a component
that aims to better understand and address gender-differentiated constraints to voluntary tax compliance.
56
CARTAC’s mission is to enhance the institutional and human capacities of countries in the Caribbean region to
achieve their macroeconomic, fiscal, and monetary policy objectives. It provides technical services in four core
areas: public expenditure management, tax/customs policy and administration, financial sector regulation and
supervision, and economic and financial statistics.
57
Antigua and Barbuda, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.
58
This work will also be crucial to respond to one of the key constraints for improved gender mainstreaming as it
will provide sex-disaggregated statistical information.

34

and poverty work will be rolled out and implemented during the first two years of the RPS, and
more up-to-date information on poverty and shared prosperity will be presented in the first
Performance and Learning Review (PLR).
Outcome 5: Strengthened capacity to manage PPPs
70.
Appropriate structuring of PPPs can help project implementation, contributing to
increasing resilience and competitiveness. To improve service delivery and free up muchneeded public resources for other initiatives, in the long term, OECS governments need to
partner with the private sector in building infrastructure, managing state assets, or carrying out
innovative investment projects. Thus, the WBG will support, through non lending activities and
trust funds, the development of a stronger institutional, legal, and regulatory framework, at
national and regional levels, for the development and implementation of PPPs. This will be
achieved by supporting OECS governments in implementing the actions identified in the
Caribbean PPP Infrastructure Roadmap that has been prepared with joint support from the Bank
and other development partners 59. In coordination with the IFC, the WBG will also support the
preparation of selected PPP transactions. Greater development of PPPs could lead the IFC to
play a greater role in the OECS.
Resilience
71.
The RPS aims at supporting OECS governments and households to better manage
the impact of shocks and adapt to changing circumstances. Through a combined focus on
strengthening social protection systems and improving the quality of education and health
systems, the RPS aims to support holistic human capital development among the poor and
vulnerable. In addition, the Bank will endeavor to incorporate a youth dimension in this
assistance, anchored on a youth survey covering all human development areas (i.e., health,
education, employment, civic engagement, and providing sex-disaggregated data). In parallel,
the Bank aims to continue building the capacity of OECS governments to effectively manage
natural disaster risks, focusing on shifting attention toward prevention and building resilience.
Proper management of these risks would lower the human and economic costs of disasters. It
would also have benefits in terms of reducing fiscal pressures and enhancing the quality of the
environment, thus contributing to growth and employment.
Outcome 6: Improved targeting and reduced fragmentation of social protection systems
72.
Enhanced effectiveness of social protection systems will strengthen the resilience of
the population, especially vulnerable groups, to shocks. Social protection systems directly
address extreme poverty, but they also address intergenerational poverty by helping families
invest in themselves, their children, and their assets. The priority will be on reducing high levels
of fragmentation and duplication, spending inefficiencies, capacity deficiencies, targeting
inadequacies, and limited abilities to respond to exogenous shocks. The reforms would improve
the responsiveness of social protection systems, particularly in times of economic and
environmental shocks. The ongoing Safety Net Advancement Project will continue to be
implemented in Grenada. The planned Regional Social Resilience and Human Development
59

The Caribbean PPP Infrastructure Roadmap identifies a number of relevant actions, both at the country and
regional level, to capitalize on the PPP potential in the OECS, such as: identify a “PPP focal point” at the national
level; training for government staff at all levels; developing priority PPP projects and pipelines; exploring the
creation of a regional PPP support mechanism, etc..

35

operation will address social protection challenges in other OECS countries, depending on their
demand. Complementary work on health systems will depend on country demand and is likely to
focus on addressing the threat of NCDs.
Outcome 7: Establishment of quality education standards
73.
Improving education standards and the skills of the labor force is essential to
enhance employability. Inadequate skillsets are among the biggest obstacles identified by
businesses operating in the OECS. Improving the education and skill set of OECS populations is
thus essential to enhance the employability of the labor force and contribute to reduced
unemployment and poverty. Enhanced vocational training will also be useful as individuals who
take employer-provided or vocational training earn, on average, at least 5 percent higher real
earnings than those who have not taken such training. The returns are closer to 5-10 percent if, as
a result of the training, the individual obtains a middle or higher vocational qualification. 60
Specific attention will be given to skills training that promote women’s labor force participation.
74.
The RPS aims to focus on improving the quality of education standards. The priority
in education is to implement the OECS Education Sector Strategy, which targets significant
improvements in educational outcomes. With support from the Global Education Partnership
(GEP), the Bank will focus its support on the establishment of quality standards and
improvement in teaching. The RPS will also support better technical and vocational education
and training to optimize human capital.
Outcome 8: Enhanced data to support evidence-based health policy to address NCDs
75.
Despite significant progress in improving their population's health in the past two
decades, OECS countries face the challenges of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) which
represent the major causes of death in the region. NCDs also account for a growing portion of
health spending, imposing a large economic burden. The OECS capacity to address NCDs is
compromised by i) the shortage of Human Resources for Health (HRH), particularly nurses,
which limits the ability to meet key health service needs, ii) lack of effective information on
NCDs, and iii) inadequate financing in the health sector.
76.
Better information on NCDs would enable better evidence-based policies and
decisions. The RPS will focus on developing a regional mechanism to systematically capture
timely data on NCDs to assess results, resource gaps, and define policies and improve programs
based on evidence.
Outcome 9: Increased capacity to manage natural hazards
77.
The RPS will help OECS countries better manage natural disasters with greater
focus on ex-ante risk reduction, planning, and financing, and enhanced rapid emergency
response capacity. Such an effort could significantly contribute to reducing the impacts of
natural disasters, especially for the most vulnerable segments of the population, who often live in
fragile houses and in remote areas prone to disaster impacts. Physical damages to housing,
schools, and health centers interfere directly and indirectly with the provision of education,
health, and social services, and therefore greater resilience has a strong positive social impact.
The approach would also help reduce the fiscal impact of natural disasters, as risks would be
60

for Fiscal Studies, ISBN 1-873357-56-7..

36

increasingly transferred to the market, and as enhanced resilience would attract more investments
into OECS countries.
78.
To this end, the RPS will aim to continue building greater resilience and enhanced
disaster risk management capacity. In coordination with other donors, and capitalizing on
available trust funds and grants, the WBG will continue helping OECS countries increase their
resilience to natural hazards and climate change impacts, through a combination of resilience
investments and resilience-building policy advice and capacity building. Specific emphasis will
be put on understanding and addressing gender-differentiated vulnerabilities and impacts, based
on women’s and men’s different roles and responsibilities in their households and
communities 61. The Bank will also support OECS governments in assessing contingent liabilities
associated with natural disasters, thus setting the basis for undertaking appropriate precautionary
measures. In addition, fiscal risk assessments will inform OECS countries in the development of
National Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance strategies and associated action plans, enabling
them to make informed decisions about efficiently transferring more disaster risk to private
capital markets. This will be achieved by continuing the implementation of a large portfolio of
disaster risk management activities (i.e., four large operations that are active in Dominica,
Grenada, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and a related additional financing
operation for Grenada planned for FY15). The WBG will complement these efforts with
activities to strengthen governments’ capacity to address individuals’, households’, and
communities’ vulnerability to disasters and strengthen their resilience, including through
transfers and social services to affected individuals, households, and communities.

4. FINANCIAL PORTFOLIO AND EXPOSURE MANAGEMENT
79.
Indicative IBRD envelope. The indicative IBRD lending program for the six OECS
countries is expected to be around US$120 million, comprising up to a maximum of US$20
million for each OECS country for the period of the RPS (FY15-19), subject to country and
program performance, IBRD’s lending capacity, and exposure management parameters.
80.
IDA-17 Resources. In addition to the IBRD envelope, four OECS countries (Dominica,
Grenada, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines) can also count on an IDA national
allocation and can leverage additional regional IDA resources, consistent with the IDA regional
allocation criteria 62 . The IDA17 (FY15-17) indicative allocation for the OECS is equal to
SDR61.3 million, an increase of around 22 percent over the IDA16 OECS allocation (SDR50.3
million) 63 (Table 8).
61

In the St Lucia disaster vulnerability resilience project (DRVP), specific focus is given on understanding how
policies may affect women and men differently and on constructing a sex-disaggregated baseline for the project,
taking into account gender differentiated needs and preferences. This work is informing the government on relevant
gender aspects to programming on climate change, and will provide useful lessons learned for the rest of the region
as well.
62
The level of IDA regional allocation to be leveraged would depend on project design.
63
However, IDA allocations are determined on a yearly basis. The final allocation for each FY during the IDA17
replenishment period will depend on: (i) the total IDA resources available; (ii) the country’s performance rating, per
capita GNI, and population; (iii) the terms of IDA assistance (grants/credits); (iv) the allocation deductions
associated with MDRI annual debt service foregone as applicable; (v) the performance, other allocation parameters,
and IDA assistance terms for other IDA borrowers; and (vi) the number of IDA-eligible countries.

Leveraging additional resources will be essential to achieve the RPS objectives. With
adequate conditions in place, support to strengthen the financial sector could require significant
IBRD and/or IDA resources, thus leaving limited resources towards the other areas of
engagement proposed in this RPS. Leveraging additional resources will thus be essential,
including supporting the proposed engagements in human development, natural disaster risk
management, and energy.
82.
Three new regional operations will be implemented under the RPS. In order to
provide selective support in areas likely to have the strongest impact on poverty reduction and
shared prosperity, three operations are planned under this RPS: a Competitiveness project, a
Renewable Energy project, and a Social Resilience and Human Development project. A fourth
operation to support the financial sector strengthening could also materialize in the context of
adequate progress on developing a comprehensive financial sector strategy - in collaboration
with the IMF, the ECCB and the CDB - and under a suitable policy and regulatory environment.
83.
In addition, implementation of the following ongoing investment operations will
continue: i) two regional projects in the areas of Private Sector Development and
Competitiveness (i.e., the Caribbean Regional Infrastructure Communication Project (CARCIP),
and the Eastern Caribbean Energy Regulatory Authority (ECERA) project); ii) in the area of
Public Sector Modernization, a Public Sector and Social Transformation project in Antigua and
Barbuda; and iii) in the area of Social and Climate Resilience, a Safety Net Advancement project
in Grenada; and a large portfolio of Disaster Risk Management projects (i.e., four regional
operations in Dominica, Grenada, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, one emergency
operation to respond to the effects of the Hurricane Tomas in St. Lucia, and a Sustainable
Financing and Management of Eastern Caribbean Marine Ecosystem Project). In addition, an
ongoing series of development policy operations in Grenada, anchored on the CDF, is expected
to have a cross-cutting impact on the three engagement areas (Table 9).

The existing portfolio for the OECS (as of June 2014) consists of six IDA, one IBRD,
and one GEF project, totaling net commitments of US$134.1 million, of which 18 percent is
undisbursed. The number of projects under implementation has gone down from 15 to 7 over
the period FY10-FY14, showing increased selectivity. However, net commitments have
increased over the years; and the average project size has increased from US$6.1 million in 2010
to US$19.2 million today. The disbursement ratio remains relatively low however, resulting in
longer implementation periods. In addition, the Bank is implementing 28 trust funds worth $31.8
million in the region, to support the implementation of projects and provide technical assistance.
The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) has evaluated six of eight recently closed projects,
with 100 percent satisfactory ratings (Table 10). In addition to close supervision, which promotes
an early response to implementation problems, the Bank will continue working to strengthen
government capacity for project implementation, including by providing annual fiduciary and
procurement training.

The lending program under this RPS may be substantially reviewed at the time of
the first PLR. Strengthening the OECS financial sector is critical to ensure macro-financial
stability and establish the appropriate engine to support private sector growth. The WBG, in
close partnership with the IMF and CDB, will work closely with the OECS governments and the
ECCB toward suitable approaches that would support strengthening key elements of the financial
sector. However, the decision to proceed with financial support will depend on the progress
achieved by the ECCB and the OECS governments in taking the necessary measures to create
the conditions for such support to be effective, including the appropriate legislative and
regulatory environment. In view of the ongoing dialogue on the nature and form of such support,
it is suggested that the lending program be reviewed at the time of the first PLR of this RPS. In
addition, flexibility in resource allocation, and leveraging additional funding, will be required
throughout the period, because of the high vulnerability and needs of OECS countries.
86.
IFC’s existing activity in the OECS focus on: i) crisis response; ii) job creation and
inclusive growth; iii) innovation, competitiveness and integration; and iv) climate change.
During FY09-FY14, IFC committed six projects for $165.6 million in the OECS, including
Sagicor Insurance (FY11), a $100 million regional commitment in insurance that had over $1.1
billion in annual premiums in 2012 and is active in every OECS country. In Advisory Services,
IFC has exposure in every member state of the OECS with a current portfolio of $14 million
focusing on Investment Climate (Tourism Investment Generation, St. Lucia) and PPPs
(Hewanorra International Airport, St. Lucia, and St. Joseph’s hospital, Grenada). In addition, IFC

39

has OECS exposure in a number of regional projects: Risk Management & Corporate
Governance, Caribbean Regional Credit Bureau and SME Banking, Business Entry, Tax Reform,
Indicator-Based Reform Advisory, Trade Logistics, and Investment Climate. Overall, IFC was
more successful through its Advisory Services. Investment opportunities proved to be limited,
mainly because of small market size. In addition, engagements through the financial sector were
constrained because of the increasingly difficult financial situation of most commercial banks in
the region.
87.
Looking ahead, IFC aims to expand its investment activities in the region. Over the
next strategy cycle, IFC Advisory Services and the newly established Global Practices of the
WBG are expected to remain a critical component of IFC’s engagement. On the investment side,
IFC expects to build on close relations with the World Bank through this strategy, which is more
focused on growth industries and targeted regional initiatives, to jointly develop more sizable
private sector investment opportunities in the financial sector as well as in infrastructure through
strengthened PPP frameworks. This should help IFC to expand its investment support, especially
in the areas of tourism, agribusiness, banking and financial inclusion, education, renewable
energy/energy efficiency, and other infrastructure areas. MIGA will continue observing potential
opportunities in the market.

5. MANAGING RISKS
88.
The risks of not achieving the development objectives of the proposed program
under this RPS are high. They include (i) a fragile macro framework and potential social
tension; (ii) potential lack of government actions to address financial sector weaknesses; (iii)
exposure to exogenous shocks and natural disasters; and (iv) complex political economy, weak
regional cooperation and low institutional capacity.
89.
The macro situation is fragile, particularly because of high debt, fiscal imbalances,
and exposure to external shocks. A drop in CBI revenues, changes in sources of oil financing,
or an external shock could all affect the fiscal sustainability of the OECS and create negative
spillovers on growth, poverty, and shared prosperity. In addition, despite a relatively secure and
stable environment in the OECS, an increasing level of youth unemployment could give rise to
social tensions. A sound macroeconomic framework and governments’ commitment to
implement structural and social reforms are critical and, if needed, the Bank’s support might be
strengthened to support these reforms. The WBG will closely monitor the macro framework
through systematic dialogue with the OECS governments around the CDF. In addition, close
coordination with the IMF will be maintained including around areas for strengthening fiscal
management through better management of public finances. The RPS also contemplates
enhancing social safety nets to mitigate the risk of social tensions. The Bank will also support
measures to improve the investment climate and labor employability, and thereby set the
foundations for greater employment and growth.
90.
Given the level of uncertainty on financial sector issues, flexibility in the
implementation of the RPS will be essential. In particular, in case of sufficient progress on
developing a comprehensive financial sector strategy and on building a suitable policy and
regulatory environment to address vulnerabilities in the financial sector, an operation to support
the financial sector will take place and the Bank might limit its engagement in the other results
areas envisaged by this RPS, unless it is able to leverage additional resources to achieve the other

40

objectives. In case of lack of progress on these issues, the Bank would refocus the program
toward building resilience; especially establishing stronger safety nets to mitigate the impact of
enhance vulnerability on the poor and vulnerable. Preserving appropriate flexibility in focus
areas, results, and the allocation of resources is, therefore, an integral feature of this RPS.
91.
Exposure to natural shocks continues to be a major threat for OECS countries,
which are still not sufficiently socially and structurally resilient to disasters. Infrastructure
repair negatively affects fiscal balances, declines in tourist arrivals reduce GDP growth and
widen current account deficits, and the human toll of natural disasters remains very high. The
WBG plans to mitigate this risk by making sure that the large portfolio of disaster risk
management operations will continue to produce results and is reoriented from a culture of
“reaction” to “prevention.” The Bank will also strengthen the social dimensions of these
operations.
92.
Lack of actions at the political level, including within the regional context, could
slow down implementation of projects and reforms, especially considering the weak
institutional capacity. Despite public commitment, it is possible, particularly in periods close to
political elections, that appropriate actions may not be taken in a timely manner to speed up
implementation of projects and reform. Political will is particularly important for effective
regional integration and economies of scale, which are critical for the realization of this program,
including ensuring a greater role for IFC. In addition, lack of well-trained human resources,
obsolete systems of government personnel management, insufficiently robust accountability
system for results, a weak enforcement culture to implement decisions, and scarce financial
resources make it difficult for governments to achieve results effectively and on time when
implementing projects. To mitigate this risk, the OECS governments have committed to
implement a program of reforms focused on fiscal sustainability and macro stability, which have
been expressed in their national and regional strategies 64 , while the WBG will maintain a
systematic dialogue with the authorities and other partners to better understand the political
economy context in each country and will take care to design operations that, while regional, will
give clients a strong sense of ownership by also addressing country-specific needs. Moreover,
the WBG will provide technical assistance and training initiatives, embedded in the operations
when feasible, to contribute to increased institutional capacity.

Annex II. Country Growth Outlook and Selected Economic Indicators
Country Growth Outlook

Antigua and Barbuda, St. Kitts and Nevis, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines show the most
favorable growth prospects. In Antigua and Barbuda and St. Kitts and Nevis, growth prospects
are improving as a number of construction projects are already on the pipeline, and tourism and
construction activity continue to recover. The IMF projections indicate that real GDP growth is
projected to reach 3 to 3.5 percent over the medium-term as a result of the positive results shown
by their CBI program. In St. Vincent and the Grenadines, growth is expected to improve with the
renovation of the international airport over the next 16-18 months, which could boost tourismrelated activity. The recent opening of two medical universities is also expected to contribute to
growth. In Dominica, growth is projected to pick up to its potential rate of close to 2 percent with
a rebound of the economy’s major growth drivers – agriculture and tourism, combined with a
negative impact from a demographic change (aging and population decline). Grenada is expected
to recover steadily over the medium-term to about 2.5 percent with a continued recovery in the
tourism and private investment. Finally, in St. Lucia, medium-term growth is expected to rise
gradually to its potential rate of 2.3 percent, supported mainly by a rebound in agriculture, which
will indirectly boost related manufacturing activity and stronger tourism arrivals, but stronger
growth will be held back by a weak banking system

Annex III. Political Context and Progress in the Integration Process
Although there have been some changes in the political landscape, the political
environment in the OECS remains stable. In Antigua and Barbuda, elections were held in June
2014, and Hon. Gaston Browne, of the Antigua & Barbuda Labor Party, won 14 of the 17 seats
in the Parliament. This is a relevant political shift after 10 years of leadership by the United
Progressive Party, led by Baldwin Spencer. In Dominica, the Hon. Roosevelt Skerrit has been
Prime Minister since 2004; the last elections were held in 2009, and new ones are expected at the
end of 2014. In Grenada, where the most recent elections were held (February 2013) and the next
are expected in 2018, the Right Hon. Dr. Keith Mitchell returned as Prime Minister, winning all
15 parliamentary seats; he had previously served as Prime Minister from 1995 to 2008. In St.
Kitts and Nevis, the Hon. Dr. Denzil Douglas is serving his fourth term in office as Prime
Minister, following his success at the general election in January 2010; the next elections are
expected in 2015. In Saint Lucia, the Hon. Dr. Kenny Anthony, who served as Prime Minister
from 1997 to 2006, resumed that post in 2011; the next elections are expected in 2016. In St.
Vincent and the Grenadines, the Hon. Dr. Ralph Gonsalves is in his third term of office as Prime
Minister, a position he has held since March 2001; the last elections were held in 2010 and the
next ones are expected in 2015.
A revised Treaty of Basseterre to establish the OECS Economic Union was ratified on June
18, 2010. Before ratification, the provisions of the Economic Union Treaty were expected to
include (i) free circulation of goods and trade in services within the OECS; (ii) free movement of
labor; (iii) free movement of capital (through the ECCB’s program of support to the money and
capital market); (iv) a regional Assembly of Parliamentarians; and (v) a common external tariff.
Within the Single Financial and Economic Space, goods, people, and capital would move freely;
member states are expected to harmonize monetary and fiscal policies and to take a common
approach to trade, health, education and environment, as well as to the development of such
critical sectors as agriculture, tourism, and energy.
A joint declaration by political leaders gave assurances that the OECS Economic Union
would not run counter to CARICOM integration but would be seamlessly integrated into
the CARICOM Single Market Economy (CSME). 1 The OECS Heads of Government agreed
that steps should be taken to ensure that the OECS Economic Union Treaty would be recognized
under the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas (establishing the CARICOM), just as the original
Treaty of Chaguaramas had recognized the Treaty of Basseterre. At the Twenty-Fourth InterSessional Meeting of the Conference of Heads of Government of CARICOM (held in Port-auPrince, Haiti, in February 2013), CARICOM leaders adopted the Revised Treaty of Basseterre
into CARICOM’s Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas, effectively giving CARICOM member states
1

The CSME is an integrated development strategy envisioned at the 10th Meeting of the Conference of Heads of
Government of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), which took place in July 1989 in Grand Anse, Grenada.
The Grand Anse Declaration had three key features: (i) deepening economic integration by advancing beyond a
common market toward a Single Market Economy; (ii) widening the membership and thereby expanding the
economic mass of the Caribbean Community (e.g., Suriname and Haiti were admitted as full members in 1995 and
2002, respectively); and (iii) inserting of the region into the global trading and economic system by strengthening
trading links with nontraditional partners. A precursor to CARICOM and its CSME was the Caribbean Free Trade
Agreement, formed in 1965 and dissolved in 1973.

the opportunity of integrating initially with the OECS and taking a seemingly quicker path to
integration. To achieve this, the Conference agreed that an Inter-Governmental Task Force
revising the Treaty of Chaguaramas would recognize the provisions of the Treaty establishing
the Economic Union of the OECS.
Despite notable progress toward integration, several factors have posed significant
drawbacks: weak commitment at the national level, political economy issues, and
inadequate resources to drive implementation at the national and regional levels. The
Economic Union Treaty created new organs for governing the OECS. 2 Among those, the OECS
Assembly (consisting of members of Parliaments) was inaugurated in August 2012. In 2008, the
61st Meeting of the Monetary Council of the ECCU approved the establishment of an “OECS
Distribution and Transportation Company” to address the deficiencies in inter-island trade by
forging greater distributional links throughout the islands and providing fast and reliable
transportation services for goods. In 2009, the OECS Commission conducted an independent
review of the existing “Policy Framework and Strategic Plan for Agriculture.” In 2011, the
OECS Council of Tourism Ministers approved the “OECS Common Tourism Policy.” An
“OECS Education Sector Strategy” was launched in October 2013. The OECS Commission
drafted an “OECS Growth and Development Strategy,” which the OECS Assembly was
expected to endorse by 2013. However, despite all this progress toward integration and the sense
of urgency to proceed on this path, it seems that political economy considerations—such as the
alignment of internal decisions with the countries’ political cycles—and the lack of sufficient
resources to drive implementation at both the national and regional levels have slowed progress
and created considerable obstacles to an effective integration process.

Annex IV. Partnerships and Areas of Donor Supporting the OECS
The World Bank’s role in the OECS aid architecture is built on its capacity to convene regional and international partnerships for
addressing the critical challenges the OECS faces. The regional aid architecture consists of a large number of bilateral and multilateral
agencies that provide development assistance to the OECS in a wide range of sectors and thematic areas that are critical to the
countries’ economic and social development. The WBG has worked closely with many of these development agencies and maintains
long-standing and mutually supportive relationships with Caribbean institutions and agencies. The Bank will systematically coordinate
with other development partners to monitor the implementation of development strategies and activities, and adjust the overall
program as needed, on the basis of each partner’s comparative advantages. Systematic bilateral meetings have been, and will continue
to be, held with such regional institutions as the OECS Commission and the ECCB. Quarterly donor meetings are organized by the
UN Resident Coordinator in Barbados, with participation by such major donors as DFID, CIDA, EC, CDB, IMF, CARICOM, and
other UN specialized agencies. Moreover, to improve coordination, frequent bilateral meetings will be held during international events
(such as the WBG/IMF Annual and Spring Meetings) or on an ad hoc basis.

Annex V. Gender Note1
OECS countries face multiple development challenges—not only in the macro-dimension of
the countries’ structural weaknesses, but also at the household and individual levels. The microlevel is characterized by a variety of inequalities, including inequalities based on gender, which
often exacerbate the development challenges. In the subregion, gender identities rooted in shared
social norms and cultural values expose men and women to specific gendered concerns that are
described in this note. Understanding the gender dimension of the socioeconomic processes is
crucial to adequately addressing the region’s gender-differentiated needs and concerns.
A. Legal & Institutional Framework
All countries have established gender divisions/departments under sectoral ministries.
Some have developed gender action plans and national policies to promote gender equality—for
example, Antigua’s National Plan of Action for Gender Affairs and Dominica’s National Policy
and Action Plan on Gender Equality and Equity. They have also taken specific actions to
mainstream gender among different government levels—for example, Dominica has established
Gender Focal Points in some government departments; and in St. Vincent and the Grenadines,
the Gender Affairs Division sits on several committee and task forces, such as the health, trade,
and poverty alleviation committees.
OECS countries are signatories to the most relevant international and regional treaties and
mechanisms. They adopted the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and ratified the
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), the
Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment, and Eradication of Violence against
Women, and the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
OECS countries face challenges in complying with international agreements and
provisions. Advances have been made in enacting laws to protect, support, and defend women’s
rights, but some countries still lag in adapting the conventions into their legal system and in
implementing them at the country level. 2 A number of OECS countries also have weaknesses in
their enforcement mechanisms, especially with reference to domestic violence. In addition,
because of human and technical constraints, not all of the OECS states are complying with treaty
reporting obligations, such as those in CEDAW, and most states have not signed. 3 Public policy
and allocation of funds related to gender issues and gender mainstreaming are underdeveloped,
and there is a shortage of sex-disaggregated data in all of the OECS countries.
B. Poverty
Despite being categorized as having high human development, OECS countries experience
a high poverty rate and financial debt and low economic growth. In the OECS countries
poverty is higher in rural areas, where half of the population lives, and rural women are among

Every four years, State parties to the CEDAW are requested to report on the implementation of the Convention at
national level. According to the CEDAW’s website, none of the OECS countries has regularly complied with this
requirement since their ratification of the Convention.

the most affected by poverty. 4 The combination of unpaid domestic work, lower income, and
higher unemployment due to limited job opportunities in rural areas means that rural women are
highly vulnerable to poverty. Additionally, their role as primary care-provider for their families
further challenges their situation.
The gender distribution of poverty in the subregion varies across countries. 5 Men and
women are nearly equally represented among the poor in Dominica. In Grenada and Saint Lucia,
however, more males than females are poor (52.2 percent and 57.5 percent, respectively). The
situation is reversed in Antigua and Barbuda and in St. Kitts, where females make up 52.8
percent and 52.5 percent, respectively, of the poor.
Poverty appears also to be intergenerational among the OECS countries. Youth are
disproportionately affected by poverty, and in several OECS countries they are at the greatest
risk of falling into the poverty trap. Additionally, in the subregion, as in most of the Caribbean,
there is growing concern about the situation of young males: because of limited education, high
drop-out rate and a shortage of job opportunities, they are more likely to engage in risky
behavior.
In the OECS countries, single mothers are particularly vulnerable to poverty. Although
single parenthood is prevalent in the subregion, states seem to be falling behind in providing
tailored support to the affected population. The OECS study on social safety nets in the Eastern
Caribbean reports that states target less than 12 percent of expenditures to single parents; and in
no country is single parenthood among the eligibility criteria for granting social safety nets. This
situation is relevant for women, since in the subregion the majority of single parents are females,
particularly in the lower income quintiles. Another concern related to single mothers is that their
poverty may sometimes lead them to engage in transactional sex to earn fast cash. 6
While poverty affects both women and men’s lives, they experience it differently. Cultural
stereotypes, gender-based differences in social roles, and access to the formal labor market shape
the way in which men and women, girls and boys are affected by poverty. USAID’s report on
Gender in the OECS notes that being a poor woman in the Caribbean often means carrying the
responsibility of a large extended family and being part of a community network of people who
support each other. Women cope with poverty through such different strategies as cultivating
fruits and vegetables for domestic use, relying on their neighbors’ support, and trying to have
more than one occupation. To meet their caring and welfare responsibility toward their family,
they also engage in survival sex mechanisms. On the other hand, being a poor man in the
Caribbean means living alone, sometimes having multiple relationships and less contacts with
family and possible children. Because of poverty and the large number of single parents and
female-headed households, fathers often fail in financially supporting their children. Typically
poor men also engage in male networks that can be either positive, such as networks for job
seeking, or negative, such as criminal networks.

C. Education
In the OECS countries boys and girls have equal access to education, but the majority of
students are girls, and the higher the educational level, the wider the gender gap. The ratio
of female to male enrolment is near parity at the primary level in almost all countries, 7 and boygirl primary completion rates vary. 8 Girls are slightly more likely than boys to be enrolled in
secondary school (except in Antigua and Barbuda and St. Lucia), but in all countries with
available data, girls are much more likely to enrol at the tertiary level.
There is a strong gender aspect to the higher levels of education in the OECS. Not only do
more young women than men enroll in tertiary education, but data shows that in 2010 girls
accounted for 65 percent of the Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate examinations and
Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examinations. 9 Girls and boys tend to make different choices
of studies and types of training: 10 at the tertiary level female students tend to choose subjects in
humanities, whereas male students to a larger extent study science. 11
D. Health
OECS countries have made significant progress in the last decade in terms of reproductive
health. The subregion is characterized by high percentages of prenatal care and of births
attended by skilled staff, factors that likely have contributed to the low maternal mortality rates.
In both Antigua and Barbuda and Grenada, maternal mortality ratio is three times lower than the
average for upper-middle-income countries (24 versus 62 per 100,000 live births in 2010) and
almost four times lower than the regional LAC average (80 per 100,000 live births). 12 St. Lucia
has a maternal mortality rate of 35, and in St. Vincent and the Grenadines the rate is 48.
Despite these encouraging health outcomes, teenage pregnancy is a major concern in the
subregion, with serious consequences for the health of both mother and child. Across the
Eastern Caribbean, a large share of women aged 15 to 49 report having their first child between
15 and 19 years of age: 40.3 percent in Grenada, and 42.2 percent in St Kitts and Nevis. 13

10
Caribbean society has been characterized by institutional sex discrimination in education, stemming from the
immediate post-slavery period. An intentional sex segregation of curricula ensured differential socialization of
males and females into gender-related roles. Girls from working-class families were prepared for motherhood or
domestic service in elite homes, while boys from working-class homes were groomed for manual labor in
agriculture and industry. Middle-class girls were prepared to be good wives and mothers, clerical workers, nurses, or
teachers, while boys from this social class were prepared for commerce and politics, among other class-appropriate
occupations. This gendered aspect of education has affected girls’ and boys’ different choice of studies and types of
training.

earn some money expose girls to multiple pregnancies and many other health risks—particularly
the risk of contracting HIV/AIDS and/or STIs. 14 Furthermore, when girls get pregnant and drop
out of school, they have fewer livelihood options than their male counterparts, which ultimately
may lead to their increased dependence and higher levels of poverty. Teenage pregnancy is also
related to poverty: in St. Lucia both qualitative and quantitative data indicate that poor women
are more likely to have their first child much earlier during their teenage years.
HIV/AIDS is another concern that seriously affects both women and men’s health in the
OECS countries, and it is deeply entrenched in gender differences and inequalities. Young
women aged 15-24, who are three to six times more likely to contract the infection than young
men, are the most at-risk population. 15
E. Labor Market Participation
Differences in the labor market based on gender pervade the subregion and affect men’s
and women’s access to and quality of employment. 16 Although working, including working
outside the home, 17 has always been part of the Caribbean woman’s identity, women face lower
labor market participation, lower wages, and higher unemployment rates than men.
Women’s labor force participation is generally low compared to men’s. 18 In St. Lucia, of the
population aged 15-64, 69 percent of women and 81 percent of men participate in the labor
force; and among the same population in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, 60.7 percent of women
and 83.3 percent of men participate in the labor force. Unemployment rates are also higher
among women than men: in Dominica, 33.8 percent of females and 20.2 percent of males are
unemployed, 19 and in Grenada 31.8 percent of females and 17.9 percent of males are
unemployed. (In Antigua, however, female unemployment is a low 4.1 percent). Youth are
particularly vulnerable to unemployment, although gender differences depend on the local
context. In Grenada, for example, 27.5 percent of male youth and 21.1 percent of female youth
are unemployed. 20 Data from 2008 regarding the regional distribution of unemployment by
education level suggest that both men and women with low education levels are more likely to be
unemployed. Also, in the Caribbean the gap in earnings between males and females is still high
at 17 percent. 21
Qualitative analysis shows that women are more involved in the informal sector than
men. 22 By contrast, men seem to be more exposed to vulnerable employment than women.23

In St. Lucia, transactional sex is not only a source of the income single mothers need to feed their children, but it
is also the greatest reason for STIs and HIV/AIDS as these women are unable to afford contraception and bargain
for safe sex. Caribbean Development Bank Poverty Assessments (2006).

profile of occupation, women in OECS countries are getting jobs in tourism and are increasing
their involvement in occupations other than the agriculture sector. 24 Today, the service sector is
the main source of employment for both men and women in LAC, accounting for 51.7 percent of
men’s and 77.7 percent of women’s employment. 25 In Antigua and Barbuda in 2008 the service
sector accounted for 93.8 percent of females’ and 69.5 percent of males’ employment, and in
Dominica 81.5 percent of employed women and 43.9 percent of employed men work in
services. 26
F. Entrepreneurship and Access to Finance
A growing number of women are involved in entrepreneurship, developing businesses in
areas such as woodwork and manufacturing. 27 Although the percentage varies, female
participation in firms’ ownership is remarkably high in the OECS: from 76 percent in St. Vincent
and the Grenadines to 32.1 percent in St. Lucia. 28 However, female owned enterprises are more
likely to be micro or small firms than medium or large firms. Additionally, they are usually
smaller, both in terms of sales and number of employees, and they tend to focus on less lucrative
areas, such as commerce and personal consumption services. Female owned firms are also less
stable, less productive, and less profitable. 29
Inadequate access to finance is among the main factors hindering entrepreneurship, and in
the Caribbean women have less access to finance than men. In a recent survey, 67 percent of
interviewed female entrepreneurs in the region report that access to finance is a critical constraint
to developing and operating firms. 30 Because women tend to work in low value-added sectors, to
receive lower wages, and to be promoted at lower rates than men, they save less than men. Other
factors impeding women’s economic development as entrepreneurs include limited access to
training, markets, and technical assistance. 31
It has been reported that there is a shortage of microfinance institutions specifically
addressing females and youth. 32 Most programs are not tailored to the specific face of poverty
in the subregion—that is, female, youth, undereducated, and rural. Some positive cases are
reported: for example, in St. Kitts and Nevis the Government provides microcredit loans at
minimal interest to enable women to finance their businesses and facilitate the starting-up of
their micro enterprises. 33

G. Natural Disasters
Although both men and women are badly hit by natural disasters, women are usually
reported to be the most affected population. 34 In the Eastern Caribbean men and women hold
different places in society, support distinctive activities, have different access to resources, and
have different priorities and needs. These differences, along with their unequal access to the
labor market and gendered differentiation of skills in the labor force, influence how both men
and women react, address and adapt to and recover from natural disasters.
Women’s livelihoods—such as employment in the tourism and the subsistence and smallscale farming sectors—and their fewer labor opportunities leave them more vulnerable and
dependent in times of disaster. Following Hurricane Ivan, Grenada’s worst-hit sector was
agriculture, including the nutmeg industry, and this led to serious loss of income among
women. 35 Women working in these areas had few other skills with which to move to another
occupation. In St. Lucia after Hurricane Tomas’s devastation, women reported that their selfsustainability was deeply hampered and they feared becoming dependent on husbands, partners,
and fathers to meet their subsistence needs. 36
Women’s higher vulnerability is also linked to their specific needs, such as those related to
health, security, and safety. 37 In a study on disaster risk management and climate change in
Dominica and other Caribbean countries, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
reports that sexual violence against women is a common risk in emergency shelters. In Grenada,
the lack of security and separate facilities for men and women contributed to the sexual abuse of
girls. Men’s vulnerabilities, on the other hand, are usually embedded in their gendered role as
protector and provider. In St. Lucia men’s major concern in the aftermath of the hurricane was
related to their inability to farm because their lands were swept away or hard to access because
of damaged infrastructure. Men are at greater risk for alcoholism, drugs, and gambling: in
Grenada increased alcohol consumption, drugs, and looting have been reported as possible
coping mechanisms among men.
Gendered roles, labor segregation, and unequal access to opportunities prevent women
from taking advantage of certain situations. Men’s resilience is mainly rooted in their
professional and work contacts, technical abilities, limited childcare responsibilities, and access
to resources. 38 For example, in Grenada, after Hurricane Ivan, men transitioned from the tourism
and agricultural sectors to the construction sector and were involved in the productive sphere
rebuilding homes. The same kind of change was not possible for women, who reported
challenges in accessing this labor market. Women’s resilience increases with extensive
knowledge of community and social networks, high level of risk awareness, and their caring
abilities. 39 Following their gender roles and socially consolidated norms, in Grenada in the
aftermath of the hurricane women devoted their energy to the caring aspects of the community,
providing moral support, preparing common meals, and comforting children. Additionally,
during the relocation phase, in line with women’s socially constructed protector role, they were

organizing personal belongings, taking care of children and men, and creating human chains to
save children, elderly people, and persons with disabilities.
The subregion lacks gendered components in the main instruments for assessing and
implementing disaster risk management (DRM) mechanisms. 40 The Hyogo Framework of
Action establishes that at both national and regional levels a gender-responsive approach is
critical to minimize risks and to strengthen resilience mechanisms. However, the OECS
Environmental and Sustainable Development Unit’s strategy on climate change and DRM gives
limited attention to gender concerns at both design and implementation levels, and its
Vulnerability Benchmarking Tool lacks elements to assess gendered vulnerabilities.
H. Gender Norms
In the OECS the gendered experience of violence is deeply entrenched in the society’s
norms, traditional roles, and cultural values. Despite adopting international instruments and
establishing institutions to protect women’s rights and eradicate violence against women, there
are still elements of a culture that often justifies violence against women in the OECS
countries. 41 Men’s experience of violence is more linked to crime-, drug-, and gang-related
activities, 42 while women are more likely to be exposed to sexual, domestic, and intimate partner
violence. 43
Young men in the sub-region are particularly at risk of being the victims and perpetrators
of violent crime. UNODC’s sex-disaggregated data for the subregion show much greater male
homicide than female homicide—the rate of male homicide (per 100,000 people) ranges from
66.7 in Antigua and Barbuda to 93.3 in St. Lucia. 44 Gang-related activities affect youth,
especially at-risk youth who are more likely to engage in criminal activities, violence, and drug
trafficking. 45 Cunningham’s study on youth at risk in LAC reports that in the region the majority
of perpetrators of violent crime are young men aged 16-25; 46 in addition, these young men are
exposed to a high risk of murder.
Women, by contrast, are more likely to be the victims of intimate partner violence and
unwanted sexual practices with their partners. Intimate partner violence is among the most
widespread forms of violence that women and girls experience. According to both UNICEF and
USAID, it is difficult to estimate the rate of violence against women because incidences of
violence are underreported and there are institutional weakness in collecting data and
investigating cases of violence. 47 Nonetheless, USAID reports anecdotal data showing that
violence and abuse are increasing in the subregion, with 40-50 percent of women experiencing
some form of domestic violence. The US State Department’s Human Rights report for St.
Vincent and the Grenadines (2012) states that “Violence against women remained a serious and

pervasive problem” and identifies domestic and sexual violence against women and girls as
among the most serious human rights problems.
Most of the OECS countries have established mechanisms to deal with domestic violence,
but effective implementation is hampered by lack of resources and gendered sociocultural
stereotypes that lead people to accept higher levels of violence and make victims reluctant to
seek professional support. CEDAW’s Shadow Report for St. Lucia notes, for example, that
although St. Lucia has had a law against domestic violence since 1994, even when domestic
violence occurs close to law enforcement bodies such as police stations, often no action is taken.
I. Female Participation in Decision-Making Spaces
In the last two decades all OECS countries have made notable progress in increasing
women’s parliamentary participation. For example, in St. Lucia the percentage of women in
parliamentary seats grew from 0 percent in 1990 to 17 percent in 2012. However, the OECS
countries, with an average of 13 percent female participation in parliament, still lag behind
upper-middle-income countries and LAC averages (22 percent and 25 percent, respectively). St.
Kitts and Nevis are farthest from the average at 7 percent, and St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the
Grenadines closest at 17 percent. 48 Women’s access to ministerial positions is still low in the
OECS countries—15.8 percent in Dominica, 19 percent in Grenada, and 20 percent in St.
Vincent and Grenadines.
In the Caribbean, as in most of LAC, women are more likely to sit in “sociocultural
cabinets” than in “economic-political cabinets.” 49 In 2011, 59 percent of female ministers
were seated in “socio-cultural ministries” and 14 percent in “economic-political ministries”.
In OECS local governments, the higher positions, such as city councilors and mayors, are
extensively held by men. 50 In Antigua, in the last 15 years no woman has been elected to any
city council, and in Dominica no female mayor has been elected since 2002.
The data on women’s access to decision-making positions are more encouraging for the
judicial branch. In the last three years women’s participation on the subregion’s Supreme Court
has ranged between 52.2 and 60 percent 51—considerably higher than the LAC regional average
of 23 percent. 52 A possible explanation could be that women are more likely to continue higher
education and are thus qualified and eligible for such roles.
J. Concluding Remarks
Gender inequality is a cross-cutting concern in all sectors in the OECS countries. It is also
an endogenous variable and can be addressed to a considerable extent by a change in the social
and cultural mindset. The fact that the existing social norms and gendered stereotypes explain the

four main critical gender issues—i.e., in education, employability, youth at risk, and violence—
suggests that continuation of status quo is simply not an efficient economic and human
development choice.
The biggest concerns for the younger generation are teenage pregnancy, HIV/AIDS, and
violence, which jeopardize social and economic progress by affecting the future labor force and
youth’s own development. The gender-based violence (GBV) that plagues the subregion puts an
additional strain on the overall health of the economy and of the society. It is important to work
strategically at the ground level to tackle the social drivers of these concerns—addressing men’s
and women’s norms and behaviors and stimulating men’s, boys’, women’s, and girls’
engagement in addressing unequal and risky attitudes.
The following points identify some areas in which the World Bank could provide technical
and financial assistance in the gender area, sometimes within World Bank projects.
However, to identify more specific interventions and support comprehensive sex-disaggregated
data sets would require country- and region-wide consultations to better understand the needs
and demands of men and women, as well as government priorities.
Gender mainstreaming
• Assist Gender Departments in developing gender action plans and gender policies and
support the incorporation of gender analysis in assessment, monitoring, and evaluation of
government programs.
• Strengthen technical skills to develop sex-disaggregated indicators within all ministries,
especially those related to labor market and violence, and support sex-disaggregated
statistical data collection and analysis.
Education
• Support the design and implementation of strategies, including constructive engagement
approaches in curriculum, to target boys’ weak educational outcomes and their high dropout
rates; develop behavioral change projects to provide boys, parents, and teachers with
alternatives to existing norms around masculinity.
• Support “second chance” learning programs, including life skills components, to improve the
quality and quantity of vocational training and work force development; strengthen public
and private collaboration, linking the education system’s second chance learning to available
employment opportunities.
• Support further research to better understand why boys are underperforming compared to
girls and dropping out at higher rates than girls, especially at the higher levels of education.
Health
• Support programs linking health practices to broader social, economic, cultural, and
environmental factors that affect health care provision.
• To change social norms around potentially risky behaviors, encourage reproductive health
education in school curricula to educate children at an early age, and educate adults.
Safety nets
• Support the development of social safety network programs that target vulnerable
populations, such as female-headed households and youth; assist single parents; and provide
tailored financial contributions to larger families.
Labor market and access to finance
• Assist labor institutions in designing policies and developing programs to improve

64

employment opportunities, especially for women and youth; set up business advisory
services to promote women’s entry into the private sector and provide consulting and training
on business expansion; work closely with the education sector to tailor “second chance”
programs to market needs; and develop tailored programs, training, and workshops to
improve women’s economic empowerment through business skills development and
knowledge.
• Support the development of micro-credit programs that facilitate women’s access to credit
and support young entrepreneurs in new ventures; collaborate with local banks to diversify
financial products and services to cater to the different needs of entrepreneurial women.
• Support more research to better understand the links between gender-differentiated
educational attainment, formal and informal labor market opportunities, and poverty, as well
as men’s and women’s different financial demands, needs and constraints.
Environmental and climate change resilience
• Encourage and support national and regional disaster relief institutions to include women’s
organizations in planning and response mechanisms, and to incorporate a gender perspective
in DRM strategies.
Gender-based violence
• Support national and local institutions in efforts to prevent GBV and support victims of
GBV, including by creating better data on victims of GBV, incorporating related topics on
gender norms in school curricula, and through awareness campaigns and media, etc.
Participation in decision-making spaces
• Support policies and initiatives to facilitate and pave the way for women’s participation in
local and regional leadership roles.
• Support initiatives that promote and facilitate women’s entrepreneurship, including through
access to finance and the recognition of female entrepreneurs.

Annex VI. Monitoring and Evaluation
Progress in achieving the goals of the RPS will be assessed through two Performance and
Learning Reviews—in FY16 and FY18—and a Completion Report in FY19. The team
understands that the lack of reliable data in the OECS may create problems in establishing
baselines for measuring progress at the start of the implementation of this RPS. Therefore,
baselines will be thoroughly reviewed at the time of the first Performance and Learning Review
(PLR), in FY16. Each PLR will be accompanied by a comprehensive OECS Country Portfolio
Performance Review to provide information on the progress of the strategy and recommend
appropriate actions to address emerging issues.
Results-based monitoring is particularly challenging in the OECS, where the collection of
timely and accurate data remains a problem, not least because of human resource and
capacity constraints. The frequent and timely availability of high-quality data on poverty and
social conditions is critical for the OECS governments to design, implement, and evaluate the
policies and programs to reduce poverty and achieve the Millennium Development Goals, and
for the Bank to monitor progress on the WBG program and the twin corporate goals. However,
sufficient statistical information on poverty has been lacking in many OECS countries. The
collection of poverty data has in general received lower priority from the OECS governments
and has largely been funded by external donors. Because of limited capacity and resources, the
National Statistical Offices (NSOs) have often contracted out much of the data collection and
analysis.
Some progress has been made in framing a sustainable regional initiative to improve data
collection and elaboration. Beginning in 2001, the World Bank (WB) began actively engaging
with the East Caribbean states 1 and the regional development partners, working with NSOs and
the OECS Commission to develop a more country-owned and sustainable regional initiative to
improve the availability of micro data, particularly household, employment, and labor data. In
recent years, the WB has collaborated with the OECS Commission to create the Living
Standards Measurement Committee, comprising the heads of all the NSOs in the region, to
improve coordination and work collaboratively to address data gaps in the domain of social
statistics. As necessary and pertinent, donors are invited to participate in the discussions as
observers. Additionally, the WB has used multidonor trust funds to financially support the OECS
Commission in conceptualizing a regional Labor Market Information System (LMIS) and
designing a harmonized Labor Force Survey questionnaire that was piloted in Grenada in 2010.
In parallel, the WB has provided extensive financing and technical assistance for designing a
pilot regional Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) System for the Economic Union, which has
been endorsed by the Secretariat and its member states. Donors such as UNICEF and UNDP are
in consultations to provide financial support for the implementation stage.
The WBG has provided initial support to move toward a Sustainable Data Program.
Building on the LMIS and M&E System activities, the WB engagement in the region has also
included support for the conceptualization of the Sustainable Data Program—a five-year survey
1

Activities were supported in the six independent member states: Antigua and Barbuda, Grenada, Dominica, St.
Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.

66

plan to increase the frequency and quality of data collection through a “progressive modular
approach.” The survey plan will use a Labor Force Survey (the harmonized regional
questionnaire developed under the LMIS) as a core module, collected every year, to which other
modules will be added (socio-demographic and consumption household-level modules, plus one
ad hoc module, depending on needs). The fifth and final year would correspond to a full-fledged
Living Standards Measurement Survey. This approach will allow for the production of yearly
data under a five-year cycle that provides both regional and national coverage of a variety of
development dimensions, and it will feed nicely into the regional LMIS and regional M&E
System. In this framework, poverty could be measured in years 2 and 5 (using the consumption
module), and estimated for the in-between years. The progressive addition of modules also
allows building capacity, moving from a relatively simple survey in year one (the Labor Force
Survey) to a complex survey in year 5 (Living Standards Measurement Survey).

67

Annex VII. The Caribbean Growth Forum (CGF)
The Caribbean Growth Forum (CGF) is a multistakeholder platform designed to identify,
prioritize, and implement activities to improve the growth-enabling environment in the
Caribbean, while promoting participatory public policy-making. It has so far engaged more than
2,500 representatives from business associations, civil society organizations, government, private
sector, media, indigenous groups, and international development agencies on themes such as
logistics and connectivity, investment climate, and skills and productivity.
The region is characterized by low growth; high unemployment, especially for youth and
women; high debt ratios (8 of the 12 most indebted countries in the world are in the Caribbean);
high incidence of crime; and growing vulnerability to external shocks. In the wake of the global
financial crisis, the high debt/low growth challenge has become even more acute.
A number of Caribbean countries reached out to international donors to find an innovative
approach to the region’s growth challenge. A suggestion was made to launch a genuinely
participatory growth initiative. Following consultations and some preparatory work, the program
started in mid-2012 with a regional launch event in Jamaica. The process is supported and
facilitated by the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Caribbean
Development Bank, Compete Caribbean, and the European Union.
Key Outcomes
Eighteen months into the initiative, positive outcomes are tangible: 12 countries formally joined
the process by establishing a national CGF chapter and completing the first phase of national
dialogue. This effort has led to the prioritization of concrete and actionable activities, and draft
action plans are now available, with details on each activity’s implementation plan (e.g.,
accountabilities, milestones, timeline, and funding).
The results of each country’s dialogue were presented at a regional forum in The Bahamas in
June 2013. At the forum, national stakeholders from government, private sector, and civil society
were able to compare notes on each other’s priorities and exchange ideas on solutions to
identified challenges with technical specialists and peers. The high-level attendance (nine
ministers, several Permanent Secretaries and Directors, and over 300 private sector and civil
society representatives and technical-level government officials) sent a strong signal in terms of
both ownership and credibility. The Bahamas Communiqué, issued by the Government of The
Bahamas during the event on behalf of CGF participating countries, attested to all parties’
commitment to inclusive and participatory policy-making, accountability and transparency in
policy implementation, and the CGF reform process itself.
By then, each government had also committed to follow up on implementation of the reform
agenda, to report back periodically on progress (every 4-5 months), and to enable independent
monitoring of the reforms by private sector and civil society representatives.
As of June 2014, six countries have completed their First Accountability Workshop (Dominican
Republic, Jamaica, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Grenada). In addition, the
Government of Dominica has approved the CGF Dashboard in a Cabinet resolution and is
preparing the progress report for the accountability workshop to be held in September 2014. A
main challenge that the CGF is addressing is the lack of trust between the public and private
sectors and the slow and poor delivery of policies. Indeed, on the one hand, although the
countries are small in size, communication is very sporadic and trust quite low between public
68

and private sector; while on the other, capacity and fiscal constraints make policy delivery
challenging.
A Regional High Level Technical Training was held in St. Kitts and Nevis in June 2014 to
engage 45 key public and private CGF stakeholders on such concepts as policy delivery,
participatory governance, and accountability and related practical tools. Invitations to this event
were extended to Anguilla and Montserrat with funding from CDB. An immediate result of this
training was the establishment of a regional CGF private sector Observatory anchored in the
OECS Business Council, focusing on monitoring a few key country strategic delivery indicators
and using a very innovative web platform.
A gradual shift in mindsets is taking place, moving toward the concept of delivering reforms, not
just outputs, with simple and useful metrics that can help keep track of progress. Participants
value highly the Bank’s role as a broker in the process (clear rules of the game, leverage,
influence, and convening power), and reform champions within government increasingly
perceive the initiative as an opportunity to put pressure on ministries and agencies that do not
deliver. In addition, through the CGF national and regional dialogues are informed by the
production of analytic work in the form of policy notes, in-depth reports, and technical
presentations at public events, using OECS country-specific data. Donor coordination has also
been significantly improved in common reform areas and has led to the provision of additional
technical assistance funds for the OECS countries.
Participation in the process has been high at both national and regional events (including national
chapters’ kick-off events and subsequent working group meetings). Extensive media coverage
has also confirmed the importance of the initiative.
The structure and format of the CGF has fostered a culture of transparency and accountability:
all information pertaining to the CGF process, all minutes, and background information
(including participants’ lists and documents elaborated by working groups) are available online
on the CGF website. 1
In addition, CGF events have served as important catalyst for teams from the World Bank
Group, Caribbean Development Bank, Compete Caribbean, and Inter-American Development
Bank to engage with each country, as evidenced by increasing levels of exchange and dialogue
since June 2012. A number of new lending and nonlending operations are being put in the
pipeline, tackling reform priorities identified during CGF dialogues. The CGF has been an
effective mechanism for development partner coordination. The continued engagement of the
UK DFID and the Canadian DFATD, as well as the increased interest of other development
partners, is a strong sign of the relevance of the CGF as a vehicle for engaging in promoting
sustainable growth in the region.

Regional Policies and Strategies

The Common Tourism Policy (2012‐2017) addresses the challenges and opportunities that can
best be addressed collaboratively at an OECS level, with a view to achieving balanced growth
and development of the tourism sector in the OECS Economic Union Area. The policy identifies
the following areas in which action is required to improve the region’s tourism competitiveness:
(i) investment and product development; (ii) community participation, sectoral linkages, and
joint procurement; (iii) human resource development; (iv) tourism awareness; (v) research and
statistics; (vi) access and transportation; (vii) regional facilitation; (viii) environmental and
cultural sustainability; (ix) marketing communications; and (x) addressing crime that involves
visitors.
The OECS Education Sector Strategy, which Member States will use to align their national
strategies and plans, is built on the successes of two previous education sector initiatives,
Foundations for the Future 1991-2000 and Pillars for Partnership and Progress 2000-2010. The
OECS vision is that all citizens, at every stage of their learning journey, from early years to
adulthood, are able to reach their full potential and be successful in life, at work, and in society.
The overarching goal of education in the OECS is to contribute to socioeconomic advancement
through a quality education system that enables learners of all ages to reach their true potential.
Seven Strategic Imperatives to achieve the vision and the goal for education in the OECS
respond to the challenges and priorities identified in the analyses, reviews, and consultations that
informed the development of the Education Sector Strategy. The Strategic Imperatives are (i)
improve the quality and accountability of leadership and management in schools, Ministries of
Education, and other education institutions; (ii) improve teachers’ quality, management, and
motivation; (iii) improve the quality of teaching and learning at all levels, using learner-centered
experiences; (iv) improve curriculum and strategies for assessment to meet the needs of all
learners at all levels of education; (v) increase access to quality early childhood development
services for children from birth to five years; (vi) provide opportunities for all learners to
develop knowledge, skills, and attitudes to enable them to progress to further education and
training and to engage in productive employment; and (vii) increase access to and relevance of
tertiary and continuing education and increase research and innovation in the OECS.

72

Annex IX. Summary of the Overall Findings of the OECS Client Survey
The findings from the FY14 country surveys fielded in four OECS countries (Grenada-GD,
Dominica-DM, St. Vincent and the Grenadines-SVG, and Antigua and Barbuda-AB) suggest a
number of themes that cut across countries; however, it is useful to explore the data at a country
level as there are nuanced differences that are worth taking into account when mapping out
country strategies.
The survey sample represents a nearly equal number of opinion leaders in each of the four
Caribbean countries. Many respondents report little collaboration with the World Bank Group
(WBG) but a fairly good level of familiarity with the institution. Respondents who collaborate
with the Bank are significantly more positive about nearly all aspects of the WBG and how it
operates than those who do not collaborate. Overall, respondents are less familiar with the Bank
than they are with other organizations, such as the OECS, CDB, and IMF.
Overall context
Opinion leaders in the four OECS countries share the view that key development priorities
include jobs (first and foremost across the countries), education, and growth (education is
recognized as a critical development priority more in SVG and AB than in GD and DM). In AB,
public sector governance/reform is considered by more respondents a top development priority.
For the most part, Foreign Direct Investment, jobs, and agriculture are seen as key to economic
growth in all the countries.
The World Bank’s role in the OECS countries
There is much agreement about where the WBG should focus its resources, and these areas are
closely aligned with the perceived development priorities: agriculture, jobs, public sector,
governance, and education. Energy appears to be an area where Bank involvement would be
valued; and in SVG, health is viewed as an important sector for Bank emphasis.
In fact when considering where the WBG’s comparative advantage is in OECS countries, 7 out
of 10 respondents believe that the WBG should lead in supporting efforts to generate
employment (far fewer believe that other donors should lead).
The WBG appears to be most valued for its financial resources, but its technical assistance,
capacity development (particularly in AB), and policy advice are also highly valued. Capacity
development emerges throughout the survey as an important and valuable aspect of the WBG’s
work; the number of respondents who report that capacity development is the most effective
instrument in their country to reduce poverty is nearly equal to those who say investment lending
is.
Operating on the ground
With most respondents reporting that they do not currently collaborate/work professionally with
the WBG, it is worth looking at perceptions of how the WBG works by disaggregating those
who say they collaborate with the institution (24%) and those who do not. Among those who say
they collaborate, survey findings indicate far more positive perceptions—for example, about the
WBG’s straightforwardness, flexibility, collaboration with other donors, and collaboration with

73

those outside of government. The findings suggest that stakeholders’ level of interaction with the
Bank is an important predictor for their views of the WBG.
This is of particular importance when considering how to build support in the OECS countries
and where it will be most important to direct support-building efforts. When considering
constituencies, more attention should be given to how to achieve results on the ground, taking
into account that the WBG does not have the resources to engage with all constituencies. It is
worth noting that more than 8 out of 10 respondents say that the Bank should have a greater
presence in their countries, and that even those who collaborate with the WBG are more familiar
with OECS than with the WBG.
Looking forward
A number of the findings relate to how the WBG can be of greater value and how it can
potentially operate more effectively:
•

Greater outreach. More than half report that the WBG could be of much more value if
it were to reach out more to groups outside of government (note the findings above
related to the relationship between collaboration and more positive views of the WBG).

•

Research findings indicate concern about the level of citizen participation. More than
half of the respondents report that failed reforms can be attributed to inadequate citizen
participation. In terms of the WBG’s capacity building, work related to citizen
engagement is viewed far less positively than capacity building in project implementation
and policy design.

•

Capacity building is highly valued. It is worth finding opportunities for expanding
capacity building in these countries.

•

Several findings related to knowledge and public disclosure are worth noting. A
majority of respondents report that they rarely or never use the WBG’s knowledge.
Nearly 4 out of 10 said the WBG’s greatest weakness is that it does not provide an
adequate level of disclosure. These two findings are worthy of consideration. Is the
Access to Information Policy known? Are there more effective ways to get relevant
knowledge into the hands of those who can use and apply the work? In the survey a slim
majority said they would prefer to get their information from the WBG through enewsletters, followed by publications and other written material and
seminars/conferences/workshops. Depending on the web may not generate interest in the
WBG’s knowledge at this stage, in the OECS countries (only 56% of respondents said
they use/have used the WBG website).

•

More innovative financial services. Nearly 4 out of 10 respondents report that they
believe the WBG should offer more financial services.

Annex XIII. OECS Regional Partnership Strategy 2010-14:
Completion Report
I. Introduction
1.
This Annex presents the draft Completion Report for the Organization of Eastern
Caribbean States (OECS) - Regional Partnership Strategy (RPS) for 2010-2014, as
revised by the Progress Report (2012). Preparation of the draft Completion Report has
been based on such documentation as project Implementation Status and Review reports
(ISRs) and Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs), project documentation, and
analytic and advisory activities (AAA), as well as on discussions with country team
members. The draft has been shared with the OECS governments and selected
stakeholders, and their comments have been incorporated.
2.
The Completion Report rates the delivery of outcomes as moderately
satisfactory. The WBG has contributed toward improving the OECS economies’
resilience to natural disasters and economic shocks. The Comprehensive Debt
Framework (CDF) is revamping the approach to the management of public debt and
providing a broader framework for policymaking. Disaster management is now more
proactive and less reactive. The stage has been set for broader regional approaches on
education, skills, social assistance, and health, in line with the expectations under the
RPS. Improved knowledge and dialogue are feeding into strategies to address financial
sector challenges. Internet coverage is rising briskly. The contribution of the Caribbean
Growth Strategy to the objective of responding differently to the challenges of growth
and employment, and the work on agriculture, are notable achievements that compensate
for the lack of traction in areas such as public-private partnerships (PPPs), business
environment, and public financial management. The rating of moderately satisfactory is
consistent with the fact that 61 percent of the objectives were either achieved or mostly
achieved.
3.
The Completion Report rates World Bank Group performance as good. The
broad objectives of the strategy fitted the reality on the ground and governments’
priorities, but limited background information and institutional capacity led to an
overambitious design that was only partially adjusted by the Progress Report. The WBG
responded effectively and proactively to emerging challenges in the region, developing
solutions and contributing knowledge to build regional consensus around common
solutions (growth, finance, public debt management), which in turn has improved the
capacity of the donor community (including the WBG itself) to coordinate their efforts.
The upgraded knowledge base now available provides the countries and the WBG with
essential tools for the next RPS. The Bank delivered on its lending agenda, and the rating
of completed projects is in line with regional averages. Portfolio performance was
affected by capacity constraints and, in some cases, issues related to the complexity of
projects’ design.

78

II. Broad Developments during RPS Implementation
4.
The OECS region has yet to recover from the global financial crisis.
Economic growth contracted for four consecutive years following the onset of the global
economic crisis in 2008 for a cumulative drop of 6 percent in total output during 20092012. A slight rebound in 2013 lifted regional real output by 1.3 percent. The region’s
major sources of growth (tourism, construction, agriculture, and offshore banking) have
suffered from weak external demand and tame efforts to improve competitiveness. Per
capita income in the region declined on average by 4.5 percent, from around US$9,200 in
2008 to US$8,800 in 2012. Across countries, per capita income fell farthest in Antigua
and Barbuda (17 percent less than the pre-crisis level), while in Dominica it increased by
more than 5 percent. Despite large variations in growth performance across the region,
recovery remained fragile for all countries.
5.
The fiscal situation in the OECS remains fragile. The sluggish economic
recovery has had implications for revenue performance, even as countries implemented
fiscal stimulus packages that led to a surge in current expenditures. Total revenue
collection in the region (including grants) dropped by around 1.5 percent on average in
2013 compared to pre-crisis levels. After a plunge in fiscal balances in 2009, primary and
overall balances improved by roughly 1.5 percent and 2 percent of GDP in 2012,
respectively, but they deteriorated further in 2013 (as the average primary deficit
increased to 1.6 percent of GDP and the overall deficit to 4.9 percent). The fiscal
situation varies across countries: the fiscal position of St. Kitts and Nevis, Antigua and
Barbuda, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines has improved because of the recent
introduction of VAT 1 and strong receipts from the Citizenship by Investment Program
(CBI); however, in Grenada and St. Lucia the situation deteriorated: current expenditure
surged in 2009 because of expansionary fiscal policies, and it has remained high since.
6.
OECS countries’ debt is increasing and has reached levels considerably
above the average for Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). The growth in debt
was influenced by the impact of a series of major natural disasters, the graduation of
countries from IDA and consequent lack of access to concessional resources, and the
global financial crisis. The high level of debt has led rating agencies to downgrade some
countries and has reduced countries’ ability to borrow from international and regional
markets. Moreover, the allocation of substantial portions of recurrent revenue to debt
servicing incurs a high opportunity cost in terms of expenditure that could have been used
to support growth and address resilience. Average total public debt-to-GDP in the region
was around 82 percent in 2013, ranging from 74 percent in Dominica and St. Vincent and
the Grenadines to 116 percent in Grenada. Many countries are already making fiscal
adjustments, and many have also sought additional financing from international financial
institutions and donors to undertake these reforms.
7.
Declining competitiveness and deteriorating productivity have been a
significant drag on potential output growth. Productivity growth, as measured by total

1

VAT introduction: Grenada (February 2010), St. Kitts and Nevis (November 2010), and St. Lucia
(October 2012).

79

factor productivity, has fallen significantly since the 1990s. 2 A stagnant and unfavorable
business environment has likely contributed to the slowdown in productivity in the
region. The countries have limited options, given the size of their markets and the high
logistics costs; a sizable share of the educated population migrates for lack of
opportunities.
8.
Increased unemployment has amplified social disparities. Although the
absence of periodic, frequent, and harmonized data makes it difficult to evaluate the
recent evolution of poverty and inequality across the OECS or to precisely assess the
impact of the 2008 global economic crisis on these indicators, it is likely that the lower
demand for OECS service exports resulting from the 2008 crisis exacerbated the already
high pre-crisis levels of unemployment. This is particularly evident for service exports
such as travel and tourism, which account for about 75 percent of GDP and employment
in Antigua and Barbuda and an average of about 27 percent of GDP and employment in
the other OECS countries. The overall perception is that poverty has increased since the
2008 crisis.
III. Delivery of Results
Pillar One: Building Resilience
Result Area 1: Promote Fiscal and Debt Sustainability
9.
The PRS noted that improved fiscal and debt sustainability, enhanced efficiency
and transparency of public spending, and more efficient delivery of public services are
critical to strengthening the ability of OECS countries to respond to exogenous shocks,
and to laying the foundation for medium-term growth. During the RPS period, the Bank
Group proposed to contribute to achieving the following outcomes: (a) strengthening debt
management; (b) achieving a fiscally sustainable wage bill and ensuring coverage of key
public services; (c) creating closer linkages between public expenditure and development
objectives through improved monitoring and evaluation; and (d) improving service
delivery across the region through regionally integrated e-government services.
Outcome 1: Debt management functions strengthened. Achieved
10.
The original RPS foresaw a contribution to reducing the debt-to-GDP ratios of
OECD countries. The Progress Report dropped this objective, as the Bank lacked
adequate instruments to contribute to its achievement. Through Stand-by Arrangements
the IMF has led this effort in some countries; with attention to comprehensive public debt
restructuring that is critical to the achievement of debt sustainability.
11.
In accordance with the Progress Report, the Bank focused its efforts on
strengthening debt management functions, including through the development of debt
management strategies. According to the information provided by the Eastern Caribbean
Central Bank (ECCB), St. Lucia, Dominica, and Antigua and Barbuda have prepared
medium-term debt management strategies (MTDSs). St. Vincent and the Grenadines is
preparing a MTDS, and a Technical Assistance Mission visited the country in March
2

Acevedo, Sebastian, Aliona Cebotari, and Therese Turner-Jones (2013), Caribbean Small States:
Challenges of High Debt and Low Growth, International Monetary Fund.

80

2014. Grenada has requested the assistance of the IMF and the Bank in developing a
MTDS, which should be ready by the end of 2014 or the beginning of 2015. WBG
support for these initiatives has been coordinated with the ECCB, which continues to lead
capacity-building efforts on various aspects of debt management, including conducting
Debt Management Performance Assessments (DeMPAs) and debt sustainability analyses
and preparing MTDSs. CIDA-funded technical assistance (TA) to the OECS supported
the ECCB work program.
12.
Most importantly, at the request of Caribbean countries, the Bank has helped
define a Comprehensive Debt Framework (CDF), which is being disseminated with the
cooperation of the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) and the IMF. The CDF initiative
is providing a solid platform for designing debt strategies in the region and is informing
the dialogue among all stakeholders. It will also be a key framework for the design of the
next RPS. A development policy operation for Grenada that will soon go to the Board has
been designed following the CDF.
Outcome 2: Fiscally sustainable wage bill ensuring key public services coverage. Not
Achieved
13.
OECS public sector wage bills have been rising gradually since the global
economic crisis, reaching around 11 percent of GDP on average in 2013. Only St. Kitts
and Nevis has shown a decrease in the wage-to-GDP ratio. The Bank’s engagement was
centered on improving the quality of civil service practices. In this regard, the Bank
supported Grenada, St. Lucia, and Antigua and Barbuda in conducting functional reviews
and human resource audits in critical ministries. During 2012-2013, the Government of
Grenada implemented HR audits in three ministries and one department, with the
objective of aligning public sector positions and employee skills with the functions and
programs for which these organizations are responsible. The Bank provided TA to
support this activity. The implementation of the recommendations of the HR audit is
pending. In addition, the Bank is currently working with Antigua and Barbuda on civil
service reform through the Public Sector and Social Transformation project – FY13.
14.
Overall, progress in civil service reform in the region has been slow, because
countries are still operating with outdated norms and practices, some of them going back
to pre-independence, and also because governments partly retain the role of employer of
last resort. In these circumstances, it has proven challenging to streamline public sector
employment and improve the quality of the civil service.
Outcome 3: Improved government services across the region through the implementation
of regionally integrated e-government services. Achieved
15.
Indicators set under the RPS Progress Report have been met, with the support of
the e-Government for Regional Integration (EGRIP) Project, which is focused on reforms
in procurement and tax and customs across the subregion. Nine new e-systems are in
place: one regional e-procurement system for pharmaceuticals; four e-tax filing systems
and four multipurpose ID systems—one of each in Dominica, Grenada, St. Vincent and
the Grenadines, and St. Lucia.
16.
The Bank’s contribution through this operation goes beyond setting up the esystems to transform service delivery. The e-tax filing system will deliver time

81

efficiencies in filing taxes online rather than manually/in person. Regional procurement
of pharmaceuticals will reduce the time to complete a pharmaceuticals requisition order
in four countries by pooling procurement across the OECS, with gains in economies of
scale, and the tender and contractual information will be available online; the availability
and affordability of pharmaceuticals should improve. The multipurpose ID system will
replace as many as five different identifier numbers with a unique personal identifier. In
addition, the project contributed to a tighter economic union: the OECS Secretariat can
adapt the web-based monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system to monitor donor projects
and progress toward the economic union; a suite of legislation for e-government is
harmonized across the region; harmonized technical standards for e-government,
interoperability frameworks, and enterprise architecture are established at the regional
level; and government videoconferencing facilities have been set up to improve
connectivity among participating countries.
Outcome 4: Greater linkage between public expenditures and development objectives.
Partially Achieved
17.
The six OECS countries embarked on a broad common public accountability
reform program targeting (i) harmonized internal and external audit and public
procurement legislation; and (ii) support to members of the audit profession, supreme
audit institutions, and the parliamentary public accounts committees. Partners supporting
the initiative included the World Bank, the IMF (through the Caribbean Regional
Technical Assistance Centre), the European Union, and the Canadian International
Development Agency (CIDA). CIDA funded TA through the Supporting Economic
Management in the Caribbean (SEMCAR) program, which provides a single platform for
participating donors to support OECS-wide public financial management reform.
18.
SEMCAR has produced preliminary results. Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, and
St. Kitts and Nevis have adopted harmonized Procurement Acts and are developing
supporting regulations and institutional processes. Antigua and Barbuda and Grenada are
modeling the revision of their Audit Acts on a harmonized act. The Caribbean
Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions completed an assessment of OECS public
oversight arrangements. Grenada and St. Lucia are preparing to pilot implementation of
the Bank portfolio through their own systems. SEMCAR has operated on an “on
demand” basis, which has led to some dispersion and difficulty in tracking outcomes and
impact. A menu approach from which countries could choose would possibly help better
channel the support and ensure quality assistance and delivery of results.
Results Area 2: Protect and Improve Human Capital
19.
The Bank Group proposed to contribute to the following outcomes:
(i) rationalized social safety net systems; (ii) an increase in the proportion of qualified
teachers; (iii) a better-skilled post-secondary labor force; and (iv) improved data and
understanding about the region’s chronic noncommunicable diseases. Delivery of results
has been satisfactory.

82

Outcome 5: Rationalized social safety net systems. Mostly Achieved
20.
The impact of the global crisis fueled awareness in the OECS countries of the
need to rationalize and target social assistance systems and led to an informed and
coordinated exchange of ideas and experiences within the subregion. The OECS
Secretariat organized the delivery of technical workshops and seminars in which
government officials shared experiences and learned about best practices, with a view to
building consensus on actions that could be taken at subregional and national levels to
strengthen social safety net systems. Simultaneously, the Bank, in collaboration with
UNICEF and UN Women, conducted social safety net assessments (SSNAs) in five
OECS countries; these assessments provided the basis for policy reforms that the
governments are now implementing.
21.
The Social Protection (OECS) nonlending TA (NLTA)—FY10 advanced regional
work and cooperation by supporting capacity building in social protection tools and
increasing knowledge about the social safety net landscape in OECS countries. The
NLTA’s products included SSNAs for Antigua and Barbuda, Grenada, St. Kitts and
Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and technical workshops to
improve capacity in targeting and management information systems. The NLTA also
partially supported the creation of a Community of Practice on Social Protection. In St.
Lucia, additional TA is supporting overall social safety net reform that is partially
grounded in the findings of the SSNA. Furthermore, broader policy reforms have taken
place as a result of the NLTA activities, particularly the recommendations of the SSNAs.
Grenada has developed a Social Safety Net Framework, and St. Kitts and Nevis has
developed and is now putting into operation a National Social Protection Strategy.
Dominica is also finalizing an Integrated Social Protection Strategy.
22.
The abundant and effective TA led to projects in Grenada (to develop a
Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) and in Antigua and Barbuda (to improve the social
protection system, improve the efficiency of social protection spending, and support labor
market programs). Both of these projects are under implementation. Previously, the Bank
had helped design a targeted social assistance system through the Dominica Growth and
Social Protection Technical Assistance Credit FY07 (TAC), already completed. The ICR
considered overall achievements under objective IV (corresponding to the social
assistance component) as substantial. The achievements included (i) modernizing and
streamlining the systems for beneficiary selection and registration; (ii) strengthening the
administrative capacity to deliver social assistance; and (iii) designing and implementing
a public information campaign to inform citizens about new approaches to the delivery of
safety net programs. A Cabinet-approved proxy means test and the Beneficiary
Identification System for the selection of beneficiaries were launched in January 2011.
As of March 2011, information of about 75 percent of current beneficiaries was entered
into the new Beneficiary Identification System, and 95 percent of those were
confirmed—slightly below the targets of 100 percent identification and registration of
beneficiaries. Delays in implementing the new system point to design flaws that did not
consider political economy roadblocks to the implementation of targeted social
assistance, and design options for addressing these political economy concerns are
currently being explored.

83

22.
This objective is considered mostly achieved, given the effective support for
improving awareness of and dialogue on social assistance among the OECS countries, the
training of staff, and the scoping of the relevant challenges that is supporting the design
and implementation of two operations on the ground. The Dominica system has been
designed and is ready for operation, and the projects in Grenada and Antigua and
Barbuda are on the way to deliver modern social assistance institutions.
Outcome 6: Increase in the proportion of qualified teachers at the primary and
secondary levels (i.e. teachers with teacher training qualification) in the OECS. Mostly
Achieved
23.
The proportion of qualified teachers at primary and secondary levels increased to
65 percent in 2013, surpassing the target set under the RPS of 62 percent for 2014.
However, these efforts have not brought about better quality outcomes. The OECS
Education Strategy 3 points to “deficiencies in the quality of education, such as inadequate
levels of literacy and low competences in Mathematics, Science and Technology.
Performance in Mathematics continues to decline with pass rates reaching 40 percent for
most States in 2011. In that year a mere 23 percent graduated with the basic qualifications
of five passes including English and Mathematics at the end of the secondary cycle. At
the early grades approximately 50 percent of students score below the national average in
Mathematics and about 40 percent are under-performing in English language.”
24.
The Bank’s contribution has been partial and indirect. The Bank supported
regional efforts to train teachers through the now completed Teachers Career Path
(OECS) ESW—FY10. IEG rated two completed Education Development Projects
(Grenada, FY09; St. Vincent and the Grenadines, FY03) both moderately satisfactory for
achievement of development outcomes, noting the relevance of the objectives, but
singling out the limited contribution to efficiency. The Bank also provided TA to the
preparation of the OECS Education Strategy. Support for better-quality education
statistics through the completed Improving Human Development Data (OECS) IDF –
FY11 has been effective, with increased availability of quality data. However, the
intended Education Sector SWAp—FY12 was not delivered.
Outcome 7: Better skilled post-secondary workers in the labor force. Achieved
25.
The Bank contributed to improving institutional capacity for training postsecondary workers, and the pilot experience can inform future efforts. The demanddriven technical and vocational training program financed by the Bank has supported the
establishment of institutions and structures for training and certifying post-secondary
workers. The indicators set under the RPS were achieved with the support of two OECS
projects: Skills for Inclusive Growth (St. Lucia, FY07; Grenada, FY09). The cumulative
number of people enrolled in training programs at level 1 or higher surpassed the targets
(912 vs. 500 in Grenada and 1005 vs. 870 in St. Lucia). However, the number of
graduates fell below the targets. Overall, the complementary indicators suggest that the
initiative had impact covering a wide range of economic sectors and engaging the private
sector above expectations. Both Grenada and St. Lucia now have a quality assurance
system firmly in place; they have also met all the requirements for issuing Caribbean

Vocational Qualifications and have been authorized to issue them. With these systems in
place, the challenge will now be to scale up pilot efforts to achieve larger impact. 4
Outcome 8: Improved knowledge and information on the subregion’s chronic
noncommunicable diseases. Achieved
26.
The World Bank has produced and disseminated analytic work on health in the
OECS and throughout the Caribbean at large. 5 The research indicates that OECS
countries are facing a health crisis, with rising rates of heart disease, diabetes, obesity,
and other noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). NCDs disproportionately affect poor
families, bringing the possibility of disability and premature death and worsening poverty
as people pay for medical treatment out of their own pockets. The report estimates that
the annual cost for treating a diabetic ranges from US$322 to US$769 in the OECS.
Acknowledging that NCDs are the major cause of death in the subregion, OECS
countries have taken steps to improve their ability to prevent and manage them. A
growing portion of health spending in the OECS is dedicated to managing NCDs, and
policies and programs could focus more on prevention at a lower cost and for better
results. Because data on the epidemiology of NCDs in the OECS are limited, the OECS
Secretariat, in collaboration with the Bank, has been supporting interventions to improve
the availability and use of data to inform policymaking, as well as to define a set of
common regional indicators to monitor NCDs. Dominica and St. Lucia are exploring
mechanisms to create incentives for achieving better results in the health sector, applying
the principles of results-based financing. The UN has recognized the Caribbean countries
as international leaders in driving the NCD agenda; however, because of a lack of
funding, comprehensive strategies to address the NCD challenge have yet to be drafted
and approved.
Results Area 3: Strengthen Climate Resilience
27.
The RPS noted, “Given the vulnerability of OECS’ small island ecosystems, the
central role of tourism in their economies, and their susceptibility to weather-related
natural disasters, the Strategy provides for support for efforts to strengthen climate
resilience and enhance environmental sustainability.” The RPS program sought to
contribute to improving resilience and moving from a passive to an active stance in the
management of natural disasters. The RPS expected to achieve the following outcomes:
(i) improved understanding of the vulnerability of critical infrastructure; (ii) a reduction
in the number of people at high risk of landslides in St. Lucia; (iii) improved management
of priority terrestrial and marine protected areas; and (iv) the establishment of long-term
financing mechanisms for critical ecosystems.
4

IEG rated both of the supporting projects as moderately satisfactory for achievement of outcomes,
downgrading the team’s satisfactory rating. At play is the fact that the projects were severely restructured
toward the end of implementation to take design flaws into account. With hindsight, the teams could have
been more proactive and restructured earlier. Still, the contribution of the project in terms of building
institutions stands. The lesson remains that skills initiatives must be complemented by policies that activate
labor demand.

Outcome 9: Improved understanding of vulnerability of critical infrastructure. Achieved
28.
Solid progress is being made toward improving understanding of the vulnerability
of critical infrastructure. An inventory of public buildings and critical infrastructure in
Grenada and St. Vincent and the Grenadines has been created as a first step in
establishing a database necessary for undertaking vulnerability assessments. The Public
Buildings database work is being carried out in Dominica under a trust fund linked to the
OECS Regional Disaster Vulnerability Reduction Project (Phase 3-Dominica- P129992)
and in St. Vincent under the Hurricane Tomas project (P124939). Additional work in
Grenada and St. Lucia is about to be finalized. The Bank has mainstreamed
understanding of the vulnerability to natural disasters through its operations, with
activities that include identifying the various risks, constructing risk maps, and data
management and monitoring. Four Regional Disaster Vulnerability Reduction Projects,
two of which have already been approved and are under implementation, aim at further
reducing the vulnerability of infrastructure and developing a comprehensive view of the
risks and the remedies.
29.
The Bank’s contribution on disaster risk management went beyond understanding
the vulnerability of critical infrastructure. First, the Bank continued supporting recovery
after major disasters. 6 Hurricane Tomas Emergency Recovery Loans in St. Vincent and
the Grenadines and St. Lucia (both 2011) responded to the governments’ request for
support in post-disaster reconstruction efforts. These projects included regional activities
on data management and monitoring, coupled with activities to tackle risks and
vulnerabilities in all Caribbean countries. The implementation of projects in direct
support of recovery efforts has taught valuable lessons on project design: rapid project
preparation led to underestimating the cost of some components and limited the
implementation of the original pipeline of investments. These lessons have been
incorporated in the design of the Regional Disaster Vulnerability Reduction Projects
series through improved cost estimates and room for flexible implementation.
30.
During this RPS period the completion of the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk
Insurance Facility (CCRIF) contributed to the creation of a Regional Insurance Fund to
provide timely resources to member countries in the aftermath of a natural disaster. The
parametric modeling of disasters under the CCRIF also contributed to the objective of
building understanding of the vulnerability of critical infrastructure. Both the team and
IEG rated this project as highly satisfactory. Moreover, the World Bank is currently
supporting Caribbean-led efforts to increase climate resilience and decrease vulnerability
to natural disasters through the Caribbean Regional Pilot Program for Climate Resilience,
which includes attention to individual countries (Dominica, Grenada, St Lucia, and St.
Vincent and the Grenadines)..
Outcome 10: Reduced number of communities at high risk of landslides in St Lucia.
Achieved
31.
Thirteen communities in St. Lucia that have benefitted from the implementation
of drainage works and guttering to ensure stable slopes in case of flooding also withstood
6

A sign that the previous efforts have had an impact is that following Hurricane Tomas in St. Lucia in
November 2010, the World Bank carried out an evaluation that found that investments over the past decade
held up well and served their purpose.

86

Hurricane Tomas. Most if not all of these community interventions were finalized under
the St. Lucia Disaster Management Project II (P086469). In addition, the Bank is
supporting Caribbean governments in the use and application of Open Data for Resilience
tools and technologies to improve geospatial data management and risk analysis and to
harmonize national and regional data-sharing on management practices. Improved
information and coordination should enhance the authorities’ capacity to respond.
Outcome 11: Improved management of the priority terrestrial and marine protected
areas. Achieved
32.
M&E systems that include biodiversity monitoring at the site level have been
established for six OECS protected areas (one in each member state). The ICR of the
OECS Protected Areas and Associated Livelihoods Project (March 2012) reports that 100
percent of the M&E systems were established. This was an intermediate indicator under
the project; notably, all of the development outcomes were met or surpassed.
Outcome 12: Long-term financing mechanisms established for critical ecosystems by
2014. Not achieved
33.
The latest ISR for the Sustainable Financing & Management of Eastern Caribbean
Marine Ecosystem Project (P103470) states that the National Protected Areas Trust Fund
( NPTAFs) are not yet established. Initial steps have been taken to establish a Caribbean
regional endowment fund and national trust funds for the OECS to promote conservation
of priority coastal and marine ecosystems, although the effort has suffered delays because
of coordination issues and a change in project implementing arrangements.
Pillar Two: Enhancing Competitiveness and Stimulating Sustainable Growth
Results Area 4: Strengthen the Domestic Financial Sector
34.
In the RPS, the Bank Group foresaw contributing to improved regulatory and
supervisory frameworks for non-banking financial institutions. As the difficulties of the
banking system became evident, the focus shifted to helping improve understanding of
the situation and designing policy options. This shift is reflected in the revisions
introduced by the Progress Report.
Outcome 13: Medium-term resolution strategy for the financial sector. Achieved
35.
The Bank’s work, carried out with DFID support and in collaboration with the
ECCB, the IMF, and the CDB, improved understanding of the financial sector situation,
highlighted the various trade-offs in strengthening the financial sector, and led to the
elaboration of strategic options to ensure financial sector stability. The tight coordination
among the CDB, IMF, and the World Bank allowed difficult messages to get through. It
took time to develop a working relationship with the ECCB because of the difficulty of
the situation. However, the gradual dialogue served to enhance awareness and to provide
evidence of the need for a solution, given the limited fiscal space in the region. IFC
supported the Bank of St. Lucia with Advisory Services in investment and SME banking.
The ECCB and the governments of the member countries are now evaluating the
adoption of a regional framework and options to strengthen the financial sector.

87

36.
The Bank also contributed to the orderly resolution of British American Insurance
Company (BAICO), a regional insurance giant that collapsed in 2009 in the aftermath of
the financial crisis. The BAICO resolution process is nearly complete, with a few
policyholders awaiting relief, subject to a grant from the Government of Trinidad and
Tobago. The orderly resolution of BAICO was an outcome under the original design of
the RPS, but the Progress Report dropped the outcome because of the time required to
reach it and the uncertainty of funding from the Government of Trinidad and Tobago.
Nonetheless, the outcome was achieved. The effective resolution of BAICO had
important demonstration effects on the capacity to address concerns in the financial
sector. In addition, IFC invested over US$150 million in two regional insurance
companies to prevent the BAICO collapse from resulting in loss of insurance coverage
for the OECS.
37.
Bank TA to the financial sector has been provided mainly with support of a DFID
grant, Restoring Financial Stability in the OECS. The work sought to tackle
vulnerabilities identified by the 2004 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) and
to address difficulties in the insurance sector—an orderly resolution for BAICO and
Clico International Life, and improved regulation and supervision in insurance.
Achievements under the grant include, for instance, extensive diagnostics of all domestic
banks (joint CBD/IMF/WB Report), a stress test of 14 banks, and identification of legal
and regulatory reforms. This grant also accommodated a crisis response to St. Vincent
and the Grenadines when the Building and Loan Association (with deposits at 12 percent
of GDP) faced a deposit run in January 2013 and had to be taken over by its newly
created supervisor. The availability of DFID funding allowed the Bank to quickly roll out
TA, and the Building and Loan Association was stabilized and returned to its members in
August 2013. Following satisfactory results on the first grant, DFID agreed to provide
two additional grants for the Bank to continue its work on the financial sector.
38.
A planned operation to provide technical support to the financial sector was not
delivered, as it was considered that more results and outcomes would be delivered with
TA. A new operation is being considered in the context of the regional framework to
strengthen the financial sector that the countries are developing.
Outcome 14: Improved regulatory and supervisory framework for the financial sector.
Mostly achieved
39.
The Bank has been working with the IMF and the CDB on supporting the
regulatory and supervisory framework for the financial sector. The Bank provided TA to
review the new insurance legislation in line with international standards and to advise
ECCU countries on the regulatory architecture for non-bank financial institutions,
building on the considerable experience it acquired in assisting with the orderly
resolution of BAICO. Two reports were prepared, which led countries to establish a
regional non-bank supervisor, starting with insurance and pensions. A draft insurance bill
was delivered to stakeholders in February 2014.
40.
In the banking sector, work is ongoing to strengthen the banking legislation and
prudential guidelines. Using extensive background work carried out with the Bank’s
support, in February 2014 countries agreed on a strategy for strengthening banking
regulation and supervision and decided that the work would start with independent
88

diagnostics and legal reforms. The Bank is also currently providing TA on the legislation
to set up an asset management company to address the high level of nonperforming loans
in the banking system.
Results Area 5: Improve Access to Quality Services for a more Competitive Business
Environment
41.
The Bank Group proposed to help achieve the following outcomes: (i) a new
regional institutional framework for energy; (ii) increased access to ICT services for the
general population; (iii) PPPs to assist in reducing government expenditure and
improving services; and (iv) simplified procedures for starting a business and for regional
trading. With hindsight, the initial design of this results area lacked a coherent supporting
analytic framework, so that outcomes appear dispersed. During implementation a
common framework has begun to emerge through the CDF and the Caribbean Growth
Initiative.
Outcome 15: Draft treaty establishing ECERA prepared for two countries by 2014.
Partially Achieved
42.
A draft Eastern Caribbean Energy Regulatory Authority (ECERA) treaty for the
regional electricity regulator is being prepared; a final draft treaty is not expected until
additional countries commit to joining ECERA. Only Grenada and St. Lucia have
officially joined the initiative, while other OECS countries are participating as observers.
Both St. Kitts and Nevis and Antigua and Barbuda have recently expressed their
intentions to join, and they may commit within six months. A Regional Energy
Committee is in place and has met eight times. A SIDSDock grant of US$1.5 million
approved by the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program is supporting efforts to
bring in new members. A review of the national electricity legal frameworks and other
efforts are under way to align ECERA’s mandate with the challenges that the countries in
the region face. In addition to the work on electricity regulation, the Bank is completing a
review of the energy sector in the OECS region that will inform governments on options
and trade-offs as countries work to diversify the power generation mix and introduce
demand management practices. The WBG has been increasingly focused on geothermal
as an option, especially in Dominica, and is undertaking background work that will help
Dominica and potentially the broader OECS region reduce external vulnerability by
diversifying energy sources away from fossil fuels.
Outcome 16: Increased access to ICT services for the general population. Mostly
Achieved
43.
The use of ICT services in the region has increased rapidly. The number of
subscribers to broadband services went from 2.88 percent in 2008 to 14.0 percent in
2013. Over the same period, broadband performance (in terms of downloading speed)
more than doubled in Grenada, Dominica, and St. Lucia, and increased by more than 50
percent in St. Kitts and Nevis . The quality of service improved as well. The Bank
contributed to these objectives through the Telecommunications and ICT Development
Projects completed at the end of 2011 and rated as moderately satisfactory by IEG for
achievement of outcomes. The ICR judged the contribution to access and quality as
substantial, but considered as modest the spillover effects on the economy, noting that

89

achieving a broader impact will take more time and effort. Despite significant
improvements in ICT infrastructure, the investment in broadband could be greater, and
the connectivity among the countries of the region and with the rest of the world needs to
be improved. Moreover, concerns about competition in the sector remain, and the impact
on development outcomes has to be further nurtured. The Caribbean Regional
Communications Infrastructure Program (CARCIP) was launched to help close these
gaps: a Phase 1 project has already been approved and is under implementation.
Outcome 17: PPPs in relevant sectors to relieve government expenditures and improve
service. Not achieved
44.
No PPP has been implemented with the assistance or support of the WBG. Efforts
on two potential PPP operations—one a deal for a general hospital in Grenada—
advanced to the point of design but did not materialize when the political environment
changed following elections. In view of the slow pace of individual operations, the
countries and WBG shifted their approach and focused on preparing the Caribbean
Infrastructure PPP Roadmap, which reviews the outlook for PPP in the region and
identifies concrete opportunities in providing improved infrastructure, the constraints on
pursuing them, and possible solutions at the project, sector, country, or regional level.
The Roadmap found a current pipeline of 14 infrastructure projects that OECS
governments are actively appraising or developing as PPPs.
Outcome 18: Simplified procedures for starting a business and trading across borders
within the OECS by 2014. Partially achieved
45.
The indicators under the RPS results framework show partial progress in reducing
the number of days to import and export in Grenada, St. Lucia, St. Kitts and Nevis, and
Dominica. Grenada adopted new regulations on entry. However, these four OECS
countries’ Doing Business rankings continue to lag behind those of other countries in the
LAC region with similar levels of income.
46.
Investment climate reforms were highlighted as critical in the IFC-WBG
partnership strategy for the OECS. In partnership with the Canadian Department of
Foreign Affairs and Trade and Development (DFATD), IFC’s Investment Climate in the
Caribbean project focused from 2010 to 2013 on reforms to improve the business entry
process and trade logistics and, to a lesser extent, on business taxation, property
registration, and enforcing contracts. The projects were partially unsuccessful because not
all reform targets were met, but legislative and regulatory changes were supported and
completed in Dominica and Grenada to streamline the process of registering a business,
while St. Lucia and St. Kitts and Nevis have still to make the regulatory changes
effective. IFC supported the installation of e-registry software adapted to each client’s
requirements and trained staff and the private sector in Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and
Nevis, and St. Lucia. The system provides work-flow functionality for electronic
submission of registration applications and approvals, and connects the Companies
Registry with the tax and social security authorities. In the three countries where the
system is operational, it has reduced by about 40% the time required to register a business
and generated US$400,000 by December 2013.

90

47.
Trade logistics are also critical to the Caribbean’s open economies and are at the
top of the reform agenda. IFC undertook trade and port logistics assessments and
supported policy dialogue between OECS governments and the private sector. During the
project, the governments of Grenada and Dominica reduced the number of days it took to
trade across borders, and governments asked to start a new project on trade logistics in
2012, in partnership with AusAID, to help automate clearance of imports. In 2012
Grenada was among the world’s top 10 economies in improving the ease of doing
business, with reforms in starting a business, trade across borders, and property
registration: between 2009 and 2014 it has reduced the number of days to start a business
from 19 to 15, and the number of days to export from 14 to 9. The support came through
the Public Sector Management TAC (FY06). Still, Grenada’s ranking in the Doing
Business report (2014) has fallen by five positions to 107. Doing Business issues are also
being considered under the Caribbean Growth Forum (CGF), and country targets have
been set.
Other activities relevant to competiveness
48.
The Bank supported small farmers in Grenada in adopting new technologies
through the Grenada Small Farmer Vulnerability Reduction Initiative Project, financed
from the Emergency Window of the Japan Social Development Fund. The draft
Implementation Completion Memorandum for the project rated the following as
satisfactory: relevance, achievement of development objectives, efficiency, and
development impact of the project. The grant put in place an innovative, demand-driven,
and market-oriented incentive mechanism to drive technology adoption. The project
benefitted from the ability to leverage additional funds and bundle services—south-south
exchange, analytic work on the logistics chain analysis of two products, regional
workshop—to provide tailored development solutions to the client. In addition, thanks to
this successful activity, a Regional Agriculture Competitiveness Project is planned under
the OECS RPS now under preparation.
49.
Growing concerns with the region’s lackluster economic growth and rising
unemployment led stakeholders to seek a nontraditional approach to the greatest
challenge facing the region—creating sustainable and inclusive growth. The CGF has
been the response. 7 The CGF is a facilitated methodology for public-private dialogue
around issues central to private sector development and growth; it seeks to enable an
action-oriented dialogue around key policy reforms needed across three thematic areas:
Investment Climate, Skills and Productivity, and Logistics and Connectivity. The CGF
engages all critical players—the public sector, the private sector, academia, youth, civil
society, and the Caribbean diaspora—in the dialogue on how to stimulate economic
growth. At the end of the first year, in June 2013, at a regional conference mirroring the
launch event, individual country action plans and the results of the first year’s
participatory dialogue were disseminated. The CGF proposes to build a “pro-growth

The CGF, a joint initiative of the Compete Caribbean Program, the Inter-American Development Bank,
the World Bank, and the Caribbean Development Bank, is supported by CIDA, DFID, the CARICOM
Secretariat, and the University of the West Indies.

91

coalition” through a broad-based but unified forum that rewards diverse constituencies
for active support. The WBG has been actively engaged in the design of the approach,
providing countries with TA to develop and implement their action plans of reforms. In
2014, the WBG—with the other institutions supporting the initiative—has begun
organizing CGF Accountability Workshops in each of the participating countries to
monitor the implementation of the agreed action plans.
50.
As of June 2014, six countries have completed their first Accountability
Workshop (Dominican Republic, Jamaica, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, St.
Kitts and Nevis, and Grenada). The Government of Dominica has approved the CGF
Dashboard in a Cabinet resolution and is preparing the progress report for the
Accountability Workshop to be held in September 2014. A main challenge that the CGF
is addressing is the lack of trust between the public and private sectors and the slow and
poor delivery of policies. Indeed, despite the country’s small size, communication is very
sporadic and trust between the public and private sectors quite low, and capacity and
fiscal constraints make policy delivery challenging. In June 2014, a Regional High Level
Technical Training was held in St. Kitts and Nevis for 45 key public and private CGF
stakeholders to engage them on such concepts as policy delivery, participatory
governance and accountability, and related practical tools. With funding from the CDB,
invitations to this event were extended to Anguilla and Montserrat. An immediate result
of this training was the establishment of a Regional CGF Private Sector Observatory,
anchored in the OECS Business Council, focused on monitoring a few key delivery
indicators through an innovative web platform. A gradual shift in mindsets is taking
place, moving away from thinking about just outputs toward the concept of reforms
delivery, with simple and useful metrics that can help keep track of progress. Participants
greatly value the Bank’s role as a broker (clear rules of the game, leverage, influence, and
convening power), and reform champions within governments increasingly perceive the
initiative as an opportunity to put pressure on ministries and agencies that do not deliver.
In addition, through the CGF, national and regional dialogues are informed by a range of
analytic work—policy notes, in-depth reports, and technical presentations at public
events, using data specific to OECS countries. Donor coordination has also been
significantly improved in common areas of reform, leveraging additional TA funds for
the OECS countries.
Rating for Achievement of Outcomes
51.
The Completion Report rates the delivery of outcomes as moderately
satisfactory. Most of the outcomes (12 out of 18) were achieved or mostly achieved.
•

Under the first pillar, the delivery of outcomes was quite strong. Important
steps have been taken to build the foundations for improved resilience in the
OECS countries. The CDF revamped the approach to public debt
management; it is now being used by the Bank and other development
partners, and it provides the basis for the new RPS. The OECS’s approach to
disaster management is being transformed from reactive to proactive. The
Bank has supported such achievements as a regional facility to insure against
disasters, an improved understanding of the vulnerability of critical
infrastructure, and investments to reduce the vulnerability of the most exposed

92

communities. Outcomes on improving human capital include analytic work
and pilots to set the basis for broader regional approaches to education, skills
development, social assistance, and health.
•

Delivery of outcomes in the second pillar, competitiveness and growth, was
mixed. The Bank contributed to both improving knowledge about and
developing strategies to address the financial sector challenges, and it
successfully continued its support for increasing access to ICT. Because of
political economy challenges, the agenda did not gain significant traction in
areas such as PPPs and the business environment. Work on supporting public
financial management advanced at a slower pace than expected. Although the
CDF and the work in agriculture (Grenada) were not reflected in the results
matrix, they represent relevant contributions that compensate for the partial
delivery on competitiveness and growth.
IV. World Bank Group Performance

52.
The objectives of the RPS were relevant to the situation and to the challenges
faced by OECS countries, as well as to the governments’ priorities. The OECS
economies had been hit severely by the 2008 global economic crisis and by hurricanes
that caused sizable disasters, especially in Grenada. The reduction in demand for tourism
services and lower remittances hit output and employment and put the financial sector—
especially the major insurance companies—under stress. A drop in public revenues and
the need to increase public expenditure to cushion the impact of the crisis led to increases
in the level of public debt. Therefore, the two pillars of the RPS (building resilience and
enhancing competitiveness) fitted well the challenges that the countries faced.
53.
Limited knowledge in certain critical areas affected the design of the RPS.
There were various gaps. First, the approach selected to manage the high level of public
debt was narrowly centered on fiscal consolidation, with limited focus on growth and
natural disasters. As a result, the RPS initially emphasized budget support operations to
accompany fiscal consolidation, an approach that did not work. Second, there was
limited background knowledge on how to spur growth and employment, and
consequently the program to help rekindle economic growth was weak. Third, the
approach to the management of natural resources was initially reactive, as in the past. In
addition, the RPS results framework did not fully capture the scope and relevance of the
WBG’s engagement in certain critical areas, even after the adjustments introduced by the
Progress Report. Finally, the RPS could have been more selective—18 objectives
stretched the capacity of the WBG and the countries. Greater selectivity could have been
obtained by a more careful analysis of the relationship between the objectives and the
program.
54.
The RPS was implemented under difficult circumstances. The OECS
economies had not recovered from the impact of the crisis because the global economy
continued to be sluggish, the opportunities to diversify were scarce, and the high levels of
public debt continued to limit the governments’ capacity to take a proactive stance.
Natural disasters added to the stress on the OECS economies. It was increasingly

93

challenging for the OECS governments and the supporting developing community to
adjust strategies and programs to the continued difficult circumstances.
55.
The WBG showed flexibility in adjusting to the emerging situations. The
Bank’s response came in various ways.
•

The Bank adjusted its lending to help repair critical infrastructure after
Hurricane Tomas in St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.
Recognizing the serious impact of disasters on the population and on the fiscal
situation, the Progress Report further directed lending toward disaster risk
management, and the new lending for disaster risk management emphasized
prevention rather than reaction only.

•

As traditional approaches to debt reduction ran their course, the Bank
gradually adjusted its approach to work on debt, growth, and finance. The
CDF, which was built on the regional dialogue and good supporting analytics,
emerged as a holistic approach to debt and macroeconomic sustainability
during the implementation of the RPS. The CDF defined for the Bank a role
compatible with its mandate and comparative advantage, thus reducing
overlap with the IMF.

•

In response to the mounting concerns about economic growth, the CGF
emerged as an innovative approach to identifying priorities and targets: OECS
countries commit to pro-growth reforms, and the commitments are tracked
over time, while donors provide TA and/or resources in line with these
commitments.

•

The work on financial sector has followed and responded to the emerging
challenges. Frank dialogue with the authorities has brought agreement on an
in-depth analysis of the situation by the Bank (now under way), and on the
need to adopt a regional approach with strong political backing to increase the
odds of dealing successfully with the emerging challenges.

56.
Lending delivery was in line with program, while it was also responsive to
emerging challenges. Since FY10, the Bank has delivered 14 operations, of which 10
were planned under the RPS or the Progress Report. Including the operations now under
preparation, IDA commitments will amount to US$198.9 million and IBRD’s to US$18.5
million. The full IDA16 (FY12-14) envelope will have been used. Of the four operations
not planned, two came about as response to Hurricane Tomas. A development policy loan
(DPL) for Grenada, now under preparation, supports the implementation of the CDF and
complements IMF efforts in support of macroeconomic stabilization. The operation is in
line with the RPS’s initial intention to provide budget support, with the difference that the
supporting policy framework is stronger than before. The proposed OECS Financial
Sector Strengthening and Regulation Project and the OECS Education SWAp were not
delivered. For the financial sector, extensive and effective technical support was provided
with the support of a DFID grant. The new RPS includes a financial sector operation.
With an OECS Education Strategy now available, financing of education will be taken up
in the new RPS.

57.
Various factors affected portfolio performance adversely. The disbursement
ratio fluctuated during RPS implementation; at an average of 23 percent, it is lower than
the LAC average (28.1 percent for 2008-2014.) Given the size of the portfolio, the
disbursement ratio is sensitive to the presence of budget support operations. Poor
capacity at the country level and at the level of the OECS Secretariat slowed down
project implementation. Moreover, compliance with procurement regulations has proven
cumbersome for the small economies. No disbursements are at risk today.
58.
Project design issues affected implementation and delivery of results. For
instance, cost estimates proved unrealistically low and affected the implementation of the
Hurricane Tomas Recovery projects. The team is now developing better cost estimates
for potential investments (e.g., bridges, roads, centers) to be ready to help manage
emergencies in a timely and effective way. Another issue that emerged is how best to
design regional engagements. Working directly with the OECS Secretariat in the
implementation of several projects, while posing interesting challenges of institution
building, proved cumbersome because of the extra layer of coordination. A superior
approach is to design regional platforms that provide menus from which the countries
select those components that best suit their challenges and their policies.
59.
The Bank sought to improve project implementation by granting the OECS
additional flexibility in the use of the Procurement Guidelines. In 2013, to improve
project performance and delivery of results and to respond to the demand of the OECS
countries’ authorities, and after consulting with the business community and
representatives of civil society, the Bank eased its procurement rules for small contracts.
The new procurement practices favor the development of local business in the OECS by
taking account of the limited number of suppliers, the prevalent forms of business
organization, and the history and size of businesses.
60.
Political economy issues affected delivery of results. Politics affected the
delivery of outcomes in various ways. First, the political cycles of the various OECS
countries are not coordinated and therefore it is not possible to align the strategy with
political cycles. Second, shifts in government affected implementation through changes
in policy or in administrative personnel. As an example, the recent change of government
is Grenada brought to a halt one PPP operation that was under preparation, and
management changes delayed implementation of the social protection projects. Third,
political economy issues have also affected the traction and development of certain
issues, such as the role of the private sector in the development process.
61.
The quality of delivery compares favorably with regional averages. For 20082014, ICRs are available for 25 OECS projects. Of these, the country teams rated 21 (85
percent) as moderately satisfactory or better, which is above LAC averages. However,
IEG rated only 18 as moderately satisfactory or above. The ratings of 10 projects were
downgraded and two were upgraded, of which one became highly satisfactory. The high
level of disconnect between the ratings of the teams and those of IEG is of concern; it
signals the need for a more careful monitoring of impact through ICRs and other
instruments.
62.
The Bank supported regional integration efforts. The RPS committed to
support regional integration and did so in various ways. First, the Bank experimented

95

through project design—some projects were implemented through the OECS Secretariat
and others were implemented directly by the borrower countries under a common policy
platform. The emerging consensus is that the second alternative is preferable because it
facilitates implementation and provides a better fit to local needs and preferences.
Second, the WBG used its convening power to develop and encourage policy dialogue at
the regional level, using sound analytics around common challenges as the basis for
regional solutions. This approach, as exemplified by the CDF and CGF, is
transformational: it helps break barriers to change and helps anchor national initiatives on
regional consensus for greater likelihood of success.
63.
The RPS AAA work increased knowledge of key strategic issues (growth,
debt, natural risks, health, education, etc.) and helped develop innovative solutions,
enhancing the Bank’s contribution to the development of the OECS countries.
Attachment III provides a list of the AAA delivered and the current pipeline, including
AAA benefiting the entire Caribbean region. The Bank budget resources allocated to
AAA have been increasing steadily, giving evidence of the importance the team has
assigned to both analytic work and TA. Highlights of the AAA agenda include support
for the OECS Education Strategy, PPP development, ICT capacity development, energy
strategy and geothermal development, logistics, and the business environment, as well as
for building a regional dialogue and capacity on social assistance, taking stock of NCDs,
and restoring financial sector stability. In addition, the design of the CDF and the CGF—
initiatives that have involved regional institutions and other development partners—
represent innovative ways to address challenges in the OECS countries and more broadly
in the Caribbean. In hindsight, although the provision of TA has been tailored to fit needs
and delivery has been timely, a greater effort was needed to go beyond targeted
assistance to build local capacity. Also, despite all these efforts, major knowledge gaps
remain, including in the areas of poverty and inclusion.
64.
Collaboration between the IFC and the Bank was strong on the advisory
side, but results were more limited in private sector investments. IFC worked in
close coordination with the WB in a range of TA areas such as business registration, trade
logistics, and credit bureaus. However, IFC investment opportunities are limited because
of the small size of the OECS, especially in the absence of stronger regional integration.
The effectiveness of the joint work between the IFC and the Bank could be further
improved. The work on PPPs is a good example of cooperation that did not meet the
expected results, primarily because of the problems with the political economy of the
region. The effort to put together a roadmap for PPPs seems a step in the right direction,
but it needs to be developed further in the next strategy.
65.
The Bank has maintained a broad and fruitful cooperation with other
development partners active in the OECS in all areas of engagement: with the IMF
on fiscal and financial sector challenges; with DFID on the financial sector; and with a
broad range of partners in supporting public expenditure reform. Support for disaster risk
management has mobilized substantial resources from global funds to complement Bank
resources in pursuit of the RPS objectives. Attachment IV lists the trust funds that
provided complementary financing in several strategic and priority areas of engagement.
In general, the World Bank’s participation in the quarterly meetings among bilateral and
multilateral partners organized by the United Nations Regional Coordinator in Barbados

96

has proven to be a valuable way to increase coordination and share relevant information
among partners.
Rating for World Bank Performance
66.
The Completion Report rates WBG performance as good. The broad
objectives of the strategy were aligned with the reality on the ground and the priorities of
the governments. The detailed design was affected by the inherited limited background,
which, combined with the limited capacity in the countries, led to an overextended design
that included 18 objectives. The results framework could have better reflected the scope
of the program and spelled out with greater clarity the chain or results between activities
and development impact. However, the WBG responded effectively and proactively to
the region’s challenges by developing solutions and building the supporting knowledge to
assist in creating regional consensus, encourage shared solutions, and improve its own
capacity and that of the development community to help. The WBG also responded in a
timely manner to the countries’ need for support after natural disasters. The WBG was
able to mobilize resources from other donors, working with them around such critical
agendas as disaster risk management, public financial management, financial sector, debt
management, and social sectors. The upgraded knowledge base now available provides
the countries and the WBG the basis to deliver outcomes under the next strategy. The
Bank delivered on the lending agenda, and the ratings of completed projects are in line
with regional averages. Portfolio performance has been affected by capacity constraints
and, at times, complex designs. Efforts to improve delivery include working on design
and being more flexible in the enforcement of the procurement guidelines to better adapt
them to the reality of small countries.
V. Lessons and Recommendations
67.
The OECS RPS 2010-14 was implemented under difficult circumstances. The
stagnation brought about by the continued sluggish global economy, the scarcity of
readily available opportunities to diversify, and recurrent natural disasters placed the
OECS economies under stress. The WBG responded by expanding attention to such
issues as economic growth and employment, sustainability, the financial sector, and
energy. Overall delivery of the program was on target with expectations, but because of
some partial shortfalls, the Completion Report rated the contribution to development
outcomes as moderately satisfactory. This section highlights the key lessons learned from
the implementation of the RPS 2010-14, which have been fully taken into consideration
in designing the new strategy.
68.
The objectives set under the RPS should be aligned with the capacity of the
WBG program to deliver. In the OECS context, with the multiplicity of countries and
the relatively small scale, it is not advisable to target overly ambitious development
objectives under a strategy. For instance, the objectives under the original RPS with
regard to alleviating the burden of public debt proved to be too ambitious for the
instruments available to the Bank, and they had to be adjusted in the Progress Report. In
addition, a greater understanding of the link between the objectives and the programs
could have helped the exercise of selectivity.

97

69.
The RPS results framework must reflect as accurately as possible the
outcomes and impact of the program. Some of the indicators selected under the RPS
did not reflect accurately the scope of engagement and achievements of the Bank’s
program—for example, those for disaster risk management and public sector
management. In reality, the impact and contribution of the disaster risk management
program exceeded the indicators selected. Poor selection of objectives and indicators can
end up shortchanging the evaluation of program delivery.
70.
The RPS support for regional integration through a combination of regional
AAA work, country-level interventions, and the building of shared understanding,
vision, and solutions across countries worked well and should be further enhanced.
It is advisable to use targeted analytic work to develop shared diagnostics that ground a
dialogue involving all shareholders around the development of regional visions upon
which countries can articulate policies and programs. This approach can have the added
benefit of helping governments break local political constraints, coordinate with
development partners, and lower the costs of developing and implementing initiatives. It
also allows countries to take the lead on different fronts, creating momentum and
encouraging peer pressure, which can be powerful drivers of change. Similarly, open
support menus lead to dispersion; it would be better for project designs to provide
countries a menu from which they can select the mix that suits them best. The approach
to supporting regional platforms needs to be monitored continuously and adjusted.
71.
A regional perspective will help enhance the opportunities for the IFC to
contribute to growth and inclusion. The small national OECS markets limit the
opportunities for the IFC to contribute. As governments and development partners
address bottlenecks to growth from a regional perspective, the opportunities for the IFC
to engage will increase. A strengthened financial sector would allow the IFC to invest
and finance, using innovative practices in making resources available to the dominant
small enterprise sector. As the efforts to sharpen a PPP agenda materialize, IFC can lead
in implementation, bringing in expertise and finance and building partnerships. A
regional approach to removing constraints to growth could identify opportunities of
relevance and scale propitious to the skills and comparative advantage of the IFC, which,
on its side, could continue to explore new practices and approaches suited for smallisland environments.
72.
In such complex environments, the Bank must maintain a flexible and open
approach to be able to respond to evolving circumstances. Several products or
activities were developed and introduced during the implementation of the RPS in
response to evolving circumstances and client demand—for instance, the CDF and the
CGF. The CDF was a response to the need to address debt issues in a broader context
than simply fiscal and disaster risk management. The CGF arose to meet the mounting
concern with economic stagnation. The Bank’s contribution to improving the assessment
of the financial sector’s situation has in turn transformed the program of support, with
deep implications for the design of the new RPS.
73.
In the past, Caribbean countries have found it difficult to undertake reforms,
often because of political economy factors. Political economy factors need to be taken
into account in both the design and the implementation of the program. The OECS
98

countries are small, highly personalized societies in which the political sympathies and
loyalties of individuals tend to be widely known and career public servants traditionally
block reforms led by politicians of the other party; and they are characterized by a
domestic and foreign private sector that has developed competitive advantages based on
concessions and exemptions; a weak civil society and media sector that lack the
necessary autonomy for advocacy; and, finally, the presence of a widespread mistrust
between public and private sector, which contributes to lower mutual expectations and
scope for engagement. Despite these challenges, the political stability and good
governance indicators that result from strong democratic institutions could help avoid
slippages and reversal once reforms are implemented.
74.
Selectivity can help improve focus and delivery. The need to respond to
evolving circumstances and demands pressured the WBG program away from selectivity,
especially during implementation. Indeed, during this RPS, the range of engagement of
the program expanded, leading in some cases to dispersion—for example, in Grenada.
Given the importance of selectivity for the quality of the program and the delivery of
results, a greater effort is needed to prioritize engagements and the rules to follow during
implementation to maintain the necessary degree of focus.

A PPP roadmap has been
prepared for each country
with the support of the WBG.
Partially Achieved
The indicators show progress
in reducing the number of
days needed for exporting
and importing. In Grenada,
new entry regulations were
issued. However, the four
countries continue to lag
behind countries in LAC with
similar levels of income.
IFC Advisory Services in
partnership with CIDA
centered on entry and
logistics in Dominica,
Grenada, St. Lucia, and St.
Kitts and Nevis (Stage 1
(2009-2011.) Stage 2
foresaw a deeper engagement
in St. Lucia and Grenada on
starting a business and
trading across borders. The
Bank assisted Grenada on
improving business
registration. Doing Business
issues are being considered
under the CGF, and country
targets have been set.

is a promising first step that
needs nurturing.
• Investment Climate –
Doing Business (OECS)
NLTA – FY11
• GD TAC (FY08) and
Public Sector Management
TAC (FY06)
• Support and Expand the
Caribbean Network of
Business Incubators – EPIC
(Caribbean-wide) – FY12

The lack of traction of the
simplification agenda has
come from the limited
priority governments assign
to this agenda. The CGF
alternative promotes
ownership by helping sharpen
government priorities and
committing to action plans to
be jointly monitored.
