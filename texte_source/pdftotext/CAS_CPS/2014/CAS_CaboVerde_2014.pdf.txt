EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
i.
Cabo Verde’s strong growth from 2000 to 2008, driven by steadily growing tourism
services and accelerated capital accumulation, translated into considerable poverty
reduction and boosted shared prosperity. During those years, GDP growth averaged 6 percent
annually and the economy grew from US$0.5 billion in 2000 to US$1.8 billion in 2012. Per
capita Gross National Income (GNI, Atlas method) reached US$3,630 in 2013, more than four
times what it was in 1990, placing the country firmly in the World Bank’s lower-middle-income
category. In 2007, Cabo Verde became one of the few nations to graduate from the United
Nations list of Least Developed Countries (LDC). The poverty rate dropped from 37 percent in
2001/2002 to 27 percent in 2007. The extreme-poverty rate dropped from 21 percent in 2002 to
12 percent in 2007, while the Gini coefficient fell from 0.55 to 0.48 over the same period. The
income of the bottom 40 percent of the population increased as a share of total income from 9.9
percent to 21 percent; its share of consumption expenditures increased from 7 percent to 19
percent. The country also made such steady progress towards achievement of the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) that achieving all of them by 2015 is within reach.
ii.
However, since 2008, Cabo Verde has been severely affected by the global financial
crisis and the impact of the European sovereign debt crisis on markets. GDP growth fell
from an average of 6.7 percent in the pre-global crisis period (2000-08) to an average of 1.2
percent since then (2009-12). The global crisis has also affected macroeconomic stability,
reflected in weakened fiscal and debt sustainability. The adverse external context marked a
strong shift in the Government’s fiscal stance. The Government has accelerated its public
investment program since 2008 as part of an ambitious drive to draw on remaining concessional
resources to provide key infrastructure. The Public Investment Program (PIP) provided a modest
impetus to economic growth but resulted in large fiscal deficits and increasing indebtedness.
iii.
Cabo Verde understands the need to reset its diversified sources of growth. The
Government recognizes that capital accumulation alone cannot sustain high growth rates
indefinitely, and that the positive external circumstances that contributed to strong growth in the
past have now become significantly less favorable. In the face of a difficult macroeconomic
position and a highly uncertain global scenario, the Government’s Third Growth and Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (GPRSP III) articulates a macroeconomic adjustment in the short to
medium term, with a strong structural reform agenda to enhance productivity as the new source
of growth and to promote shared and more diverse growth.
iv.
Enhancing macroeconomic resilience and ensuring sustained growth through
improvements in productivity are two interdependent endeavors. It will be crucial to contain
expenditure, and especially to maintain the commitment toward decelerating the Public
Investment Program. Fiscal consolidation implies a smaller fiscal envelope, which means that the
public sector will need to increase its efficiency in expenditure management and promote a
greater role for the private sector in Cabo Verde’s economic growth. A dynamic economy will be
a crucial ingredient for reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio and thus strengthening fiscal and debt
sustainability.
v.

Cabo Verde will have to prepare itself for financing at market terms given that
graduating from the UN list of LDCs in 2007 means that access to concessional financing is
phasing out. Domestic public borrowing is limited by the need to support the currency peg and
the risk of crowding out private investment. Thus, the government will have to mobilize new
external resources to finance its existing and future debt obligations. Strong fiscal discipline and
i

a downward-trending debt-to-GDP ratio will be indispensable for accessing financing at market
terms, both from development partners and international capital markets more generally.
vi.
Tourism will remain the key driver for growth and enhancing its performance will
be critical. Over the past 15 years, the country has succeeded to position itself as a “sun, sea and
sand” destination, and in 2013, for the first time the number of tourists visiting in one year
exceeded the population of Cabo Verde. The contribution of tourism to local GDP grew from 5
percent in 2000 to around 20 percent in 2012. Given the sustained inflow of Foreign Direct
Investment (FDI) in tourism, the sector is expected to continue being a driver of growth and a
source of employment in the medium and long term.
vii.
Against this backdrop, the FY15-17 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) aims at
supporting Cabo Verde in enhancing macro-fiscal stability and addressing growth
challenges. The CPS outlines the financial and technical support of the World Bank Group
(WBG), organized around two complementary programmatic pillars: (a) enhancing macro-fiscal
stability in order to set the foundation for sustained growth, and (b) improving competitiveness
and private sector development. The latter includes support to establish a conducive investment
climate and improve the performance of the tourism sector and other sectors (e.g. fisheries and
agriculture) that are potential drivers of poverty reduction. Knowledge products will include,
among others, technical assistance to help the country develop external financing tools as part of
its transition for financing at market terms.

I.

INTRODUCTION

1.
Cabo Verde is an archipelago of 10 islands located off the west coast of Africa. Nine
of these islands are inhabited by approximately 500,000 inhabitants. The country has few natural
resources and suffers from serious water shortages exacerbated by cycles of long-term drought,
one of the main causes of emigration in Cabo Verde’s earlier history. It is believed that now at
least as many Cabo Verdeans (and descendants) live abroad as on the archipelago.
2.
The preparation of the proposed CPS (FY15-17) was delayed in order to give time to
the government and the World Bank Group to assess the severe impact of the global
financial crisis and the European sovereign debt crisis on Cabo Verde’s economy. This
assessment has informed the design of the proposed CPS. The CPS was also informed by broad
consultations with all stakeholders, including government officials and members of civil society
and the private sector.
3.
The CPS is in line with the GRSP III, and guided by the WBG’s two strategic goals
of reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity. Cabo Verde has already made great
strides in reducing extreme poverty and increasing the welfare of the bottom 40 percent. Through
the WBG’s focus on agriculture as a cornerstone of poverty reduction, and on strengthening the
linkages of tourism to the agriculture and fisheries sectors, the WBG program will support the
Government’s target of reducing the poverty rate to 20 percent by 2016. Through support to
private sector development, in particular to the tourism sector, the WBG program will boost
shared prosperity.
II.

COUNTRY DIAGNOSIS

2.1. OVERVIEW
4.
Cabo Verde is a robust democracy. The Polity IV index, which measures the strength
of a country’s democratic institutions, rates Cabo Verde high in the region. Cabo Verde has not
experienced a single coup d’état, a West African record shared only by Senegal. Since the
adoption of a multiparty system in 1991, Cabo Verde has enjoyed remarkable political stability.
The African Party for the Independence of Cabo Verde (PAICV) and the Movement for
Democracy (MpD) have dominated Cabo Verdean politics, with each party having ruled for
about a decade and alternating power regularly and peacefully.1 In 2003, Freedom House lauded
Cabo Verde’s achievements since independence (Figure 1). Cabo Verde’s strong institutions are
reflected in its score in the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA)
(Figure 2): it ranks at the top among IDA-recipient countries in the Sub-Saharan African (SSA)
region, and third among all IDA countries.

1

In fact, currently both parties are in the Government, with the PAICV controlling the cabinet and the MpD the
presidency. This power sharing arrangement, in place since the 2011 elections, has been functioning smoothly.

5.
A steadily expanding tourism sector and accelerated capital accumulation were the
drivers of economic growth. Fueled by strong external demand, tourism export receipts grew
from US$40 million in 2000 to more than US$400 million in 20122, an annual growth rate of 19
percent, much higher than the 6 percent observed for worldwide tourism in this period. The
boom in tourism was driven by large FDI inflows, while the extensive utilization of Official
Development Assistance (ODA) enabled the Government of Cabo Verde to increase public
investment to about 10 percent of GDP over the last two decades. Consequently, Cabo Verde
now has a relatively well-developed stock of infrastructure assets. Pivotal to the economic
success was the establishment of the exchange rate regime, pegged to the euro, as a new
mechanism for conducting monetary and exchange rate policy, which was supported by prudent
fiscal policies. In addition, the fixed exchange rate facilitated the growth of FDI, remittances and
migrant deposits, producing positive effects on growth, consumption and national savings, and
providing liquidity to the domestic financial sector.
6.
There has been noticeable progress in terms of poverty reduction and boosting
shared prosperity. The poverty rate dropped from 49 percent in 1988/89 to 37 percent in
2001/2002 and then to 27 percent in 2007. The proportion of the population in extreme poverty
also dropped significantly, from 21 percent in 2002 to 12 percent 2007. Income distribution and
shared prosperity have improved. The Gini coefficient fell from 0.55 in 2002 to 0.48 in 2007,
while the income of the bottom 40 percent as a share of total income increased from 9.9 percent
in 2002 to 21 percent in 2007. Moreover, the share of expenditures of the bottom 40 percent in
total expenditures increased from 7 percent in 2002 to 19 percent in 2007, demonstrating that the
welfare of the bottom 40 percent has improved substantially. The GPRSP III projects a reduction
in the poverty rate to 20 percent by 2016, to be achieved by promoting modernization of the
agriculture and fisheries sectors, in which poverty incidence is most acute, thereby enhancing
employment prospects for poor and vulnerable groups.
7.
A poverty mapping exercise revealed that tourism growth in Cabo Verde has the
potential to lift more people out of poverty. Poverty is particularly low in Sal and Boa Vista,
the islands that have experienced much of the tourism growth (Figure 3). These islands were two
2

Latest available official data.

2

of the three islands that reduced poverty the most between 2000 and 2007, when tourism grew
from 7 percent of GDP to nearly 20 percent. The large drop in poverty rates is largely due to the
migration of Cabo Verdeans from other islands to seek economic opportunities in the relatively
well-paying tourism sector. While the national poverty headcount is about 27 percent, the
poverty headcount among agriculture and fisheries workers is 44 percent and 35 percent,
respectively. Poverty among households linked to the tourism sector is just 12 percent. Falling
poverty rates on other islands have likely been fueled by internal remittances from relatives
working in the tourism sector in Sal and Boa Vista.

Cabo Verde has also improved its social indicators. Cabo Verde ranks 132nd out of
187 countries in the UNDP’s 2013 Human Development Index (HDI), the third-highest ranking
in SSA, putting it in the “medium human development” category. Cabo Verde’s average life
expectancy, estimated at 71 years, is the highest in SSA. The infant mortality rate fell from 26
per 1,000 live births in 2007 to 15 in 2011. The maternal mortality rate fell from 36 per 100,000
live births in 2006 to 26 in 2011. By 2011, 94 percent of children under one year of age were
fully immunized, and the percentage of the total population living less than half an hour from a
health center reached 86 percent. Similarly, education outcomes put Cabo Verde at the top of
Sub-Saharan Africa. The adult literacy rate is estimated at 87 percent, although disparities persist
between men and women.
9.
Despite its rapid economic growth in the 2000s, Cabo Verde continues to experience
high unemployment, currently at 16.4 percent, as the rate of job creation has been lower
than the growth of the economically active population. The current and projected
demographic structure will likely generate a high and growing number of young workers
entering the labor force. An analysis of the dynamics of labor force participation by gender
indicates that an increasing number of women will enter the workforce. Without a comparable
increase in the demand for labor, this trend will increase the unemployment rate, and likely affect
women disproportionately. Female unemployment is almost 3 percentage points higher than
male unemployment. Cabo Verde’s unemployment is not only biased towards women but also
towards youth, and is especially acute among low-skilled workers. Large regional differences in
3

unemployment are also observed. In addition to high unemployment, the islands of Santiago,
Santo Antão and São Vicente show evidence of significant skill gaps.
10.
Unemployment is not the only problem affecting Cabo Verde’s young and female
populations. Young people and women generally have lower skills and labor productivity and
tend to work in low-quality jobs. The available data show that informality is higher than average
among women and youth. Individuals younger than 25 years old are mainly employed in the
informal sector, the population between 25 and 35 years old is mainly formal, and the population
between 35 and 60 years old is distributed almost evenly between formality and informality. The
majority of elderly workers are employed in the informal sector. Results also show that
informality is highly correlated with female workers, disadvantaging them in the labor market.
Table 1 show that households headed by women are significantly poorer than households headed
by men across all of the nine inhabited islands.

11.
In Cabo Verde, the importance of the diaspora is indisputable. The Cabo Verdean
diaspora is large and estimated to number at least as many as the population of the archipelago.
The vast majority are based in European countries and the United States. Indeed, emigration has
been essential to the archipelago and today it is one of the main channels through which the
country participates in the global economy. The diaspora supports the Cabo Verdean economy in
four ways. First, they send home remittances. Second, they deposit a considerable amount of
savings in Cabo Verdean banks, accounting for 40 percent of total deposits. Through financial
intermediation, these deposits can support domestic investment and growth. Third, some
members of the diaspora have invested in domestic enterprises through FDI. And fourth, it is
estimated that Cabo Verdeans returning for holidays and vacations comprise about 20 percent of
the total tourism industry.
12.
While the diaspora has played and continues to play a critical role in the country’s
economic and social life, there is untapped potential to engage the diaspora in supporting the
transition of Cabo Verde to a higher income country, either as investors or as agents for the
transfer of know-how in several areas of expertise. Furthermore, with about two-thirds of Cabo
Verde’s tertiary-educated population living abroad, the diaspora can generate human capital
gains. The GPRSP III recognizes the central role that the diaspora can play in the economic
development of the country

4

2.2. MAJOR DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES AND THE WAY FORWARD
13.
Cabo Verde faces three interrelated development challenges. First, it is confronted
with a difficult external macroeconomic environment, compounded by weakened fiscal accounts
and vulnerable external accounts. Second, while economic growth will continue to be mainly
driven by the tourism industry, the sector needs to be more closely linked to the rest of the
economy, to increase tourism’s multiplier effect. Third, Cabo Verde needs to increase its
competitiveness by fostering private sector investment as its future growth has to rely less on
physical capital accumulation and more on improvements in productivity.
14.
Analytical work prepared in the last 4 years has informed the identification of the
country challenges, in particular the recently completed Country Economic Memorandum
(CEM).

2.2.1

A difficult macro-fiscal scenario and the need to enhance stability

15.
The global financial crisis and double-dip
recession in the Eurozone exacted a heavy toll on
Cabo Verde’s economic growth and macroeconomic
stability (Figure 4). After strong GDP growth that
averaged 6.7 percent annually since 2000, Cabo Verde
experienced a recession in 2009 as GDP contracted by
1.3 percent, recovering modestly to 1.5 percent in 2010
and to 4 percent in 2011. Another recession in the
Eurozone in 2012 contributed to renewed economic
weakening. Falling imports, decelerating credit to the
private sector, contracting FDI, frail business confidence,
flat inflation, and increases in unemployment and nonperforming loans, suggest that growth has remained
anemic since then, estimated at 0.5 percent for 2013 and
1.0 percent for 2014. Overall, Cabo Verde’s average
GDP growth rate in the post-crisis period (2009-13) fell
to 1.2 percent from 6.7 percent in the pre-crisis period.

The fall in revenues as a consequence of the economic slowdown accounted for
almost 40 percent of the deterioration of fiscal balances.3 Due to the simultaneous drop in
both tax revenues and donor grants, Government revenues fell from an average of 28.7 percent
of GDP in 2006-08 to 25.2 percent in 2009-2013. Tax revenues fell from an average of 21.5
percent of GDP in 2006-08 to 18.6 percent in 2009-13. As a result of the economic crisis among
Cabo Verde’s main development partners in Europe, external grants fell from an average of 4.9
percent of GDP to 3.6 percent in 2009-13. In 2014, the government made a considerable effort to
increase revenues to counteract the fall in revenues, including the raising of VAT rates to the
national level of 15 percent for sectors, including hotels and restaurants, which were previously
only subjected to a 6 percent rate. The revenue outturn of the first half of 2014 shows that this
has translated into considerable revenue gains on VAT; however, persistent economic weakness
continues to moderate the overall revenue outturn. This CPS, through the PSRCs series, will
continue to support government’s efforts in improving tax revenues.
17.
Increases in total spending, and in particular investment, have been responsible for
the remaining 60 percent of the worsening fiscal balances. The wage bill has remained stable
at around 11 percent of GDP, which is comparable to that of other small economies in which
economies of scale are not available. As a result of the recent elimination of energy subsidies,
price-supporting measures in Cabo Verde are very low, at less than 1 percent of GDP. However,
the authorities have undertaken an ambitious investment program, mostly financed by
concessional borrowing. When the Public Investment Program was initiated in 2008, public
investment more than doubled. Since then, public investment as a percentage of GDP (including
investments through SOEs) has remained in double-digits. To some extent, strong public
investment constituted a counter-cyclical policy response against strong economic headwinds
from 2009 onward—although its economic multiplier effect tends to be small due to an import
content of about 90 percent. Expansionary fiscal policy led to increased deficits and reversed the
declining trajectory of the public debt, which reached an estimated 99 percent of GDP in 2013.
However the debt is largely concessional, with an average maturity of 23 years and an average
interest rate of only 0.75 percent, such that interest payments are low, at about 2 percent of GDP.
18.
A stochastic Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) prepared by the Bank team
indicates that the trajectory of public debt is sustainable, but significant vulnerabilities will
persist in the short term. Based on the authorities’ Medium-Term Expenditure Framework
(MTEF) and Medium-Term Debt Strategy (MTDS) for 2014-17, which were agreed by the Bank
and authorities, the DSA indicates that the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to reverse its increasing
trend in 2016, when it will reach a peak of about 120 percent of GDP. It is then expected to fall
slowly to about 80 percent of GDP by 2030.
19.
Financing its debt obligations will become a key challenge for the country, as
concessional resources decline. The Public Investment Program is almost entirely financed by
project loans from bilateral and multilateral development partners. Gaps in the operating
balance 4 and amortizations are financed mainly with domestic public borrowing and budget
support. Both are limited: domestic public borrowing is limited by law to 3 percent of GDP, and
budget support is limited by the financing allocations of development partners—which are either
phasing out or becoming less concessional following the country’s graduation from LDC status.
Future borrowing will increasingly be devoted to servicing the outstanding debt (i.e. interest
payments and amortizations). Gross Financing Needs (GFN) are expected to fall, driven by the
retrenchment of the Public Investment Program, and by recent efforts to mobilize domestic

revenue. However, it will be a crucial challenge for Cabo Verde to access new non-concessional
external financing to service its debt obligations. Table 3 presents the key economic indicators
for 2011-2017.
Table 3: Key macroeconomic indicators: 2011 – 2017

Medium term outlook
20.
The challenge for fiscal policy in the coming years is to strike the right balance
between supporting growth and preserving macroeconomic discipline and debt
sustainability. The Government should pursue a gradual medium-term fiscal adjustment
trajectory. On the revenue side, building on the achievements of the tax reform5, the Government
should continue the revenue reform by closing tax loopholes, and consolidate achievements in
tax administration.
21.
On the expenditure side, the Government should pursue the gradual declining
trajectory of public investment. Both the 2015 budget and the Medium-Term Expenditure
Framework (MTFF) for 2014-2017 indicate that the retrenchment of public investment and net
lending has commenced in earnest. Some large foreign-financed investments, including a social
housing program, expansion of the Praia airport, the renovation of the Boa Vista seaport, and an
energy project financed by IBRD, will keep investment spending relatively high until the
completion of these projects. The Government will not add any new projects to the PIP but focus
on execution of existing projects. Furthermore, the Government has begun developing a new
national public investment system with Bank support whereby all investment projects will be
subject to a rigorous technical assessment to calculate financial, economic and social returns
based on reliable statistics. This should help the Government select investment projects that
guarantee value for money.
22.
The fiscal adjustment required over the medium term to maintain debt
sustainability is feasible and consistent with the Government’s new economic growth
model. Reducing debt levels implies lower spending, which suggests that growth-enhancing
fiscal policies will come not from higher public investment, but mainly from expenditure
reallocations and efficiency enhancements. At the same time, falling ODA needs to be offset by
increased efficiency in tax collection. The “fiscal diamond” (Figure 5) illustrates Cabo Verde’s
shifting fiscal priorities, with a stronger emphasis on domestic revenue and expenditure
efficiency. Reducing borrowing in a context of declining ODA flows requires efforts to increase
domestic resource mobilization and reducing public expenditures, especially public investment.
Not only do these have short-term macroeconomic implications, but they should also shape the
country’s new fiscal policy for growth: less aid, less borrowing, more domestic revenue and
more efficiency. Implementation of the PEMFAR6 recommendations through the modernization
of public finance management (PFM), enhancement of the public investment management (PIM)
system, and improvements in the performance of SOEs, will be critical for the fiscal
consolidation.

5

To strengthen domestic revenue mobilization, the Government adopted a tax package that increased the valueadded tax (VAT) rate paid by hotels and restaurants from 6 to the standard rate of 15 percent; broadened the base of
the VAT to include public utilities and oil; introduced a tourism fee of 2 euros per guest per night and a fee for the
statistical registration of customs transactions; and expanded the base of the ecological tax on non-biodegradable
imports.
6
The recent Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR, 2013) prepared by
the Bank, the AfdB, the EU and the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation (EACID), provides a more
detailed assessment of Cabo Verde’s government expenditure management. This assessment covers expenditure
management in the health, energy and environment sectors

23.
Finally, the Government will need to prepare itself for financing at market terms.
Expanding the financing envelope and reducing reliance on concessional budget support, while
staying within the statutory limit for domestic borrowing, will be crucial for the Government to
finance its debt. The African Development Bank has already phased out concessional budget
support to Cabo Verde; the European Union will stop providing concessional budget support
grants in 2020. In the future, World Bank budget support will be provided under IBRD terms.
Moreover, as any emerging economy, Cabo Verde will increasingly have to access international
capital markets. The small volumes of bond issues associated with a small economy, and high
indebtedness resulting in weak sovereign credit ratings, will pose hindrances.
2.2.2

Improving state-owned enterprise (SOE) performance and public sector efficiency

24.
Contingent liabilities incurred through state-owned enterprises pose significant
fiscal risks and exacerbate medium-term vulnerabilities. SOEs in Cabo Verde provide vital
services, especially in the strategic areas of transport, water, and electricity. The five largest
SOEs in Cabo Verde are Empresa Nacional de Aeroportos e Segurança Aréa (ASA, operating
the country’s airports); Empresa Nacional de Administração dos Portos (ENAPOR, operating
the country’s harbors); Transportes Aéreos de Cabo Verde (TACV, the state airline); Empresa de
Electricidade e Águas (ELECTRA, the national water and electricity utility); and Imobiliária,
Fundiária e Habitat (IFH, providing housing services). These five SOEs account for 70 percent
of state-owned capital and hold assets equivalent to 32 percent of GDP. Four of the five focus on
transport and utilitiesvital areas for economic development and poverty reduction.
25.
These SOEs have long been a source of contingent liabilities for the government, due
to their generally weak commercial and financial performance. Given that the central
government is the main shareholder, it directly or indirectly bears all risks of the SOEs’ poor
financial performance. The total debt of SOEs reached 26 percent of GDP in 2012. While the
SOE debt guaranteed by the state amounts to just 4 percent of GDP, the critical services that
SOEs provide mean that the state is effectively obligated to lend financial support to the SOEs
even on non-guaranteed obligations. The SOEs sometimes cover their losses by postponing
maintenance or reducing services, but normally they induce financial transfers from the central
government by defaulting on debts or accumulating arrears with providers. Cumulative debts and
triggered contingent liabilities result in periodic recapitalization and debt swaps. Therefore, the
effective contingent liabilities generated are actually much higher than the SOE debt officially
guaranteed by the state. According to a recent Ministry of Finance report on SOEs (2013),
9

underlying contingent liabilities in SOEs amounted to 11.6 percent of GDP in 2012 (including
both guaranteed and non-guaranteed debt). The same report states that aggregate financial losses
reached 1.4 percent of GDP in 2011 and 1 percent of GDP in 2012. A social housing project,
Casa Para Todos, implemented by IFH, is financed with a loan equivalent to about 11 percent of
2013 GDP.
26.
Reforming SOEs to ensure their financial sustainability is one of the major
challenges for the near future. Support under the previous CPS has yielded tangible results
(Box 1). But analytical work conducted by the WBG confirms that there is room to significantly
improve SOE performance in delivering services. Over the last five years, the Government has
been working to strengthen SOE management and oversight. In 2009, the Govenment adopted a
new law restructuring the legal and governance framework for SOEs (Lei do Setor Empresarial
do Estado). However, the effectiveness of state oversight and ownership continues to be limited
by weak institutional capacities. Reforming the governance of SOEs need not only address
inefficiencies in service delivery, but also improve financial performance to reduce contingent
liabilities and improve the sustainability of public debt. In particular, ensuring that Casa Para
Todos is implemented as originally anticipated will make a major contribution to reducing the
debt-to-GDP burden.
Box 1: Combination of DPL and Sector Operations Instrumental in Advancing Structural Reforms
The PRSC series and the transport sector credits have been supporting each other and helping advance the
reform agenda in the transport sector. Actions supported under PRSC VIII related to publication of the
consolidated report on the 2011 SOE financial statements by the Ministry of Finance. The audited statements of the
main SOEs provided the detailed financial information needed to analyze the weaknesses of those SOEs, and to
define the needs of the transport SOEs in terms of technical assistance and reforms. TA in the air transport sector
(funded by the Road Sector Support Project closed in June 2013) helped define short-term strategic cost-saving
measures, including actions under the PRSC VIII, such as shutting down losing routes and reviewing the free travel
policies for staff and families.
The signing of performance agreements between the Government and ASA, ENAPOR, and TACV is a
proposed action for PRSC X. The drafting of these agreements will be supported by the TA component of the new
Transport Sector Reform Project (TSRP). In the road sector, the TSRP is funding performance-based road
rehabilitation and maintenance contracts covering four islands and about 35 percent of the national road network,
contributing to the 65 percent target objective set for 2015 in the PRSC series. PRSC IX supported the revised fare
policies for ENAPOR (ports), also supported by the TSRP, which finances the necessary consulting services.
In the electricity sector, reforms supported by the PRSC series led to the resolution of longstanding legislative and
regulatory issues (passage of legislation securing electricity bill payment by municipalities, and more recently final
adoption of new legislation to strengthen judicial enforcement of measures against electricity theft). This was
complemented by the IBRD-funded Recovery and Reform of the Electricity Sector Project (RRESP) which is
financing energy mix investments and ELECTRA reform that have reduced the frequency and duration of load
shedding and fuel costs.

2.2.3

Enhancing the performance of the tourism sector

27.
Since 2007, tourism has been the main driver of growth in Cabo Verde (Figure 6).
Tourism in Cabo Verde began when the Government started buying vast tracts of land in Sal and
Boa Vista, two islands with attractive beaches and small populations; and also created special
tourism development zones to encourage FDI. In 2010, hotels and restaurants generated 83
percent more jobs than in 2000, underlining the sector’s ability to generate employment. Sixtyfour percent of those jobs were held by women. The World Travel and Tourism Council 7
7

10

estimates that the tourism and travel sector generates around one-eighth of all jobs in Cabo
Verde. If indirect jobs are added to the equation, the sector generates more than 30 percent of
employment with its linkages to other sectors such as construction, and to a lesser extent,
agriculture, and fisheries.

28.
The capacity to design and implement a second generation tourism strategy is very
limited and dispersed among several stakeholders. The tourism sector is currently overseen
by the General Directorate of Tourism (DGT) within the Ministry of Tourism, Industry, and
Energy. Tourism investment promotion is handled by Cabo Verde Investments (CVI), but its
activities are limited in scope. As highlighted in the GPRSP III, the CVI’s inadequate capacity
and dispersion are reflected in poor promotion and marketing, lack of data8 analysis to support
decision-making, weak regulatory capacity, limited dialogue with the private sector, and lack of
product diversity and supply. As identified in the GPRSP III, the Government needs to establish
a national tourism organization with strong private sector involvement to provide much-needed
leadership.
29.
Environmental quality is a matter of serious and growing concern, particularly
given the importance of natural capital to the tourism industry. Maplecroft, in its 2015
climate change vulnerability index (CCVI)9 identifies West Africa coastal areas as at high risk.
Coastal erosion, sand extraction, the mismanagement of limited water resources and various
forms of pollution all pose a significant threat to the country’s growth prospects. In addition, as
a small island nation, Cabo Verde faces significant challenges associated with climate change—
especially rising sea levels and the greater frequency of severe weather patterns—which could
increase the likelihood and severity of droughts and flooding. Rapid economic growth is often
associated with environmental degradation, and environmental issues are particularly pertinent
for Cabo Verde, as the health of the tourism industry largely depends on the natural beauty of the
archipelago.
30.
The country’s tourism potential and the corresponding development impact remain
to be fully exploited. Tourism development in general, and especially more recent projects, have

against 75 indicators under 14 different pillars.

11

tended to favor the model of large-scale, all-inclusive resorts, with smaller accommodations on
more populated islands often catering to the local population rather than to international visitors.
A recent World Bank study finds that all-inclusive resorts and larger bed and breakfasts,
especially those targeting high-end tourism, have the biggest effect on the economy. Apart from
their considerable contribution to the national budget through taxation and the generation of
employment, they can also have a considerable effect on national production through linkages
with other sectors, especially services, fishing and agriculture (fresh food and vegetables).
However, such linkages are underdeveloped due to the weakness of inter-island transport and
local agriculture, which limits the ability of the tourism sector to reduce poverty and increase
shared prosperity.
31.
Investing in agriculture value chain development will focus on increasing
agricultural productivity and promoting links between producers and the tourism sector.
Efforts in the agriculture sector have focused on managing irrigation, dam and reservoir
construction, expanding the area under drip irrigation; introducing new technologies10; extension
services, rural road construction; and improving access to finance. In total eight dams are
planned in order to supply 7 million m³ of water to irrigate 700 ha of land and allow several crop
rotations a year. The result is a clear increase in output and a more commercial orientation away
from subsistence and reliance on staples, but more efforts are needed to improve agriculture
productivity through the adoption of improved technologies. In addition, to enable producers to
enter the tourism value chain will require promoting contract farming mechanisms with local
food traders and hotels and ensuring that the local supply is of the quality required for targeted
markets. There is a clear opportunity for job creation for youth and women in particular in the
areas of services, production, processing and marketing. This will help address some of the
country’s major development challenges, including the high rate of poverty among farmers (44
percent) as well as the high rate of unemployment among local youth and women.
2.2.4

Improving competitiveness and private sector development

32.
In Cabo Verde, total factor productivity (TFP) has been weak in recent years.
Different growth decomposition exercises undertaken for the 2014 Country Economic
Memorandum indicate that TFP has had a negligible or even negative impact on growth. A
simple decomposition exercise using physical capital and labor force shows that after a negative
contribution since independence in 1974, only in the period of 19952000 did TFP have a
positive contribution to growth. Factoring in Cabo Verde’s considerable improvements in
education, as well as a growth dividend from an expanding labor force, the calculations suggest
that TFP has made a consistent and negative contribution to GDP growth (Figures 7 and 8).
33.
To continue to enhance its growth potential and move up the income ladder, Cabo
Verde will need to make productivity its new driver of growth. Intensifying investment in
human capital is one element of this story. Reallocation of factors from low to high-productivity
sectors will also be necessary, with improvements in labor force skills and labor market
flexibility to enable these reallocations. This implies enhancing the performance of the main
source of growth—the tourism sector—as well as the supporting sectors (such as infrastructure,
financial sector, and skills development). The public sector will increasingly have to assume an
enabling role for private sector-led growth.

2.2.4.1 Investment climate
34.
Cabo Verde needs to undertake further investment climate reforms and address a
number of cross-cutting constraints to improve its global competitiveness. Some of Cabo
Verde’s key weaknesses identified by the 2014 Global Competitiveness Report (Figure 9)
include its market size (due to its limited domestic market); infrastructure (constraints relating to
electricity supply, mobile phone subscriptions, availability of airline seats); innovation (limited
availability of scientists and engineers, weak spending on R&D, limited patents); financial
market development (high cost of financial services, difficult access to credit); and technological
readiness (relatively limited internet bandwidth and internet penetration).

35.
In terms of the legal environment, Cabo Verde was 122nd out of 189 countries in the
overall 2015 Doing Business ranking (Figure 10): There has been significant progress in some
areas. For example, the One-Stop-Shop reduced the registration process from 52 to 10 days, and
the number of procedures from 12 to 7, between 2008 and 2014. However, from an international
13

perspective, although the country performs better than immediate neighbors such as Mauritania,
Senegal or The Gambia, it ranks well below the best African performer—Mauritius—which is
ranked 28th. Cabo Verde still lags behind in many areas, including (a) lengthy procedures to get
construction permits; (b) difficulty in obtaining credit; (c) complexity of trade procedures; (d) the
lack of a bankruptcy law; an ineffective court system (e.g., it takes many years for banks to
redeem collateral in case of loan default); and (f) the high cost of electricity. Investment climate
reforms in these and other areas are critically needed if the private sector is to play the
envisioned leading role in economic growth. This is especially important for the tourism sector,
as it operates in a very competitive global market, where the high cost of doing business
translates into a less price competitive sector.

36.
Despite substantial progress in human capital development over the past two
decades, improving human capital productivity remains a challenge. The Government has
spent a considerable share of its budget on improving the education system. Between 2000 and
2010, total economically active population increased by 28 percent and the employed population
by 25 percent, even as total population increased only 13 percent. Increased labor force
participation resulted in a demographic dividend for the economy. However, the World
Economic Forum 2012 Competitiveness Report scores Cabo Verde poor on labor market
efficiency (124th out of 142 countries). A better functioning of the labor market is another
element of the reform agenda to ensure that improvements in the qualifications of the labor force
are reflected in higher labor productivity.
2.2.4.2 Ensuring financial stability and expanding access to credit
37.
Cabo Verde’s financial sector is relatively well developed, with credit to the
economy close to 60 percent of GDP. The financial sector is dominated by eight commercial
banks (four larger and four smaller), which together account for about 80 percent of financial
sector assets. There are 10 non-bank financial institutions including a venture capital firm, three
currency exchange bureaus, a payment services provider, a leasing company, three securities
fund management companies, and a money services provider. A public-private risk guarantee
agency has been established to support lending to small and medium enterprises (SMEs), but it is
not yet operational. The stock exchange has four listed companies with a total market
capitalization of US$91 million. There are also a number of offshore national banks, which have
very limited linkages with the domestic economy and are poorly regulated, making them a
source of reputational risk for the country. Most Cabo Verdeans have bank accounts at
commercial banks. There are 1,138 bank accounts per 1,000 adults, about twice as many as in
peer countries, which have a median of 545 accounts. The Government has started a number of
14

initiatives to improve financing for SMEs, including Novo Banco (a publicly owned commercial
bank), CV Garante (a credit guarantee scheme), a venture capital fund, and a fund to foster
entrepreneurship. The Government is also improving the conditions for microfinance.
38.
However, access to finance for small and medium enterprises remains a major
obstacle in Cabo Verde. While large corporations can borrow relatively easily and at interest
rates comparable to those in the Eurozone, SMEs, which account for 95 percent of Cabo Verde’s
private sector companies, struggle to obtain finance. In the 2014 Global Competitiveness Report,
access to finance is rated as the single most important constraint to doing business in Cabo
Verde, with almost a quarter of survey respondents identifying it as a major obstacle. In addition,
the global financial crisis and Eurozone recession have not left Cabo Verde’s banks unscathed,
aggravating existing vulnerabilities. Some of the vulnerabilities in Cabo Verde’s financial sector
are a consequence of the small size of the market. For example, most banks are exposed to the
same large clients, mostly in the real estate and construction sector. This increases the risk of
contagion from shocks across financial institutions.
39.
Regulatory capital ratios have been falling as asset quality has declined due to weak
profitability. Non-performing loans (NPLs) have increased considerably since the onset of the
global financial crisis, reaching 20 percent in September 2013. Capital asset ratios fell as banks
built provisions, accounting for rising NPLs. The Central Bank has taken an increasingly
proactive role in supervising banks, with a considerable amount of technical assistance from
partners to closely monitor and address vulnerabilities in the financial sector.
2.2.4.3 Improving infrastructure management
40.
Cabo Verde has taken significant steps to close its infrastructure deficits through
high rates of public investment, which have largely been financed through an intense effort to
mobilize external revenues. Cabo Verde now has a relatively well-developed stock of basic
infrastructure. Nearly all of the nine inhabited islands have both marine and air access, and more
than 72 percent of the national road network is paved, however maintenance is still an issue. The
country has four international airports and three local airports, as well as nine seaports, seven of
which have been modernized and expanded in the last five years. Its energy generation capacity
is 156 MWs, of which almost 25 percent is renewable. As of 2014, more than 98 percent and 60
percent of the population have access to electricity and running water services, respectively.
41.
Maintaining and making the most of the country’s infrastructure has become a top
priority for Cabo Verde. For example, while the national electrification rate is high—as a
consequence of large investments in energy—the 2014 Global Competitiveness Report ranks the
quality of Cabo Verde’s electricity supply as very poor, with frequent and lengthy power cuts.
And whereas much of the transport infrastructure is in good condition, inter-island connectivity
is a major bottleneck for economic integration. Therefore, one of the most crucial challenges at
this stage is to improve the management of electricity and transport SOEs, bringing in the private
sector through private-public partnerships (PPPs) to improve services and maintain existing
infrastructure.
42.
Energy: With support of World Bank investments and TA and development policy loans,
since 2011, notable progress has taken place in the electricity sector, including the resolution of
longstanding legislative and regulatory issues (passage of legislation securing electricity bill
payment by municipalities, and more recently final adoption of new legislation to strengthen
judicial enforcement of measures against electricity theft). Since 2012, Cabo Verde is unique in
West Africa in having adopted and successfully implemented tariff regulation mechanisms
which ensure full cost recovery on a sustained basis. While much remains to be done to improve
15

ELECTRA’s operational performance, the measures implemented by the GoCV since 2011, have
allowed the utility company to make significant progress in key areas such as addressing the
backlog of gen-set maintenance and improving the generation mix. In particular, the frequency
and duration of load shedding have improved markedly since 2011 and 2012, and fuel costs have
decreased significantly thanks to renewable generation penetration. The government is pursuing
the reform of ELECTRA and the scale up of its energy mix, including increasing the share of
renewable energy.
43.
Ports: In 2013, the Government undertook a series of reforms with WBG support, aimed
at increasing private sector participation in the operation and delivery of port services. These
included review and amendment of the Law of Ports of 2010; a new regulatory framework for
the sector; changes in the statutes of the Maritime Port Institute (Instituto Maritimo Portuario,
IMP), which became the Port and Maritime Agency (AMP), charged with economic and
technical regulation of the sector; and changes in ENAPOR to turn it into a concessionaire of
existing ports, with a new legal basis for entering into sub-concession contracts.
44.
Air transport: One of the most difficult challenges facing the transportation sector is air
transport. At the core of these challenges is the difficult financial position of Cabo Verde’s
national airline, Transportes Aereos de Cabo Verde (TACV). Due to the geographic disposition
of the Cabo Verde archipelago and the unreliability of maritime transportation between islands,
air transportation has become the dominant transport mode for the development of tourism
beyond the three islands with international airports, and the only practical option for reaching
certain destinations. TACV’s financial solvency has been hampered for years by an array of
managerial and structural issues, such as the lack of proper assessment of economically viable
routes and ticket pricing, high labor costs, revenue leakages, lack of appropriate controls and
financial reporting, and rapidly accumulating arrears. Large resulting losses have required
capitalizations by the central government, which have made TACV, as currently managed, a
fiscal liability for the state.
2.3. OTHER DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES
2.3.1

Regional Integration

45.
While Cabo Verde is a very open economy, its links with the global economy are
highly concentrated in Western Europe. The increasing importance of the tourism industry has
led to a commensurate dependence on the Eurozone economies. The United Kingdom, France,
Germany, Portugal, and Spain are the most important consumer markets for Cabo Verde’s
tourism service exports, as well as the most important sources of imports and FDI inflows. These
countries are also among the major destinations for Cabo Verdean emigrants, and together with
the United States they represent the main source of remittances. In addition, donor institutions of
Portugal, Spain, and the European Union (EU) have been major sources of ODA inflows. The
exchange rate peg to the euro also reinforces the ties with Europe. In addition, in 2007, Cabo
Verde and the EU signed a Special Partnership Agreement (SPA), which offers Cabo Verde
access to European internal markets as well as the possibility to gradually take part in certain EU
policies and programs. The agreement also encompasses the possibility of funding from the
European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) in the framework of cooperation with the
outermost regions and other budget lines managed by the European Commission.
46.
Despite some increase in the last years, Cabo Verde’s trade, investments and
migration flows with the Africa Region are marginal. Cabo Verde is part of ECOWAS, but its
share of exports and imports to the other 13 members of ECOWAS constitute barely 2 percent of
total trade flows. For many years, ECOWAS regional integration was slow and uneven, but this
16

process has recently been accelerated, especially due to the adoption of the ECOWAS common
external tariff, expected to begin in January, 1, 2015, and the ongoing negotiations on the West
Africa Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the EU. Furthermore, the protracted
recovery of the Eurozone countries and Cabo Verde’s overall diversification strategy suggest that
integration with the Africa Region and other markets needs to be explored, in view of the
potential now arising from trade with emerging economies. The GPRSP III recognizes the need
to diversify Cabo Verde’s partnerships, and this CPS will further strengthen Cabo Verde’s
regional cooperation, with the inclusion of Cabo Verde in West Africa regional programs,
including the ongoing West Africa Regional Fisheries Program and the upcoming West Africa
Agricultural Productivity Program.
2.3.2

Statistical capacity

47.
Cabo Verde’s statistical development is weak for a middle-income country (Annex
3). According to the World Bank’s statistical capacity index, Cabo Verde scored 66 in 2013,
above the averages of 63 and 60 for IDA countries and Sub-Saharan African countries
respectively, but well below the IBRD average of 75. The main constraints include lack of
predictable funding, dependence on donor support for the implementation of surveys and
censuses, and the scarce human resource capacities associated with the small size and geographic
fragmentation of the country. The low and unpredictable funding and limited technical capacity
led to (a) infrequent and limited quality of micro- and macro-data; (b) weak systems and
analytical capacity to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of public policies; (c) undeveloped
systems to archive, disseminate and grant access to statistical products and indicators. Several
donors, including the World Bank through the Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Building, as
well as the African Development Bank, the IMF, and bilateral donors are currently providing TA
to the National Statistics Institute (INE).
III.

GOVERNMENT VISION

48.
The challenges identified above are reflected in the GPRSP III, which lays out Cabo
Verde’s transition to a productivity-driven economic model. The GPRSP III entails several
important policy shifts compared with previous poverty reduction strategies. The most important
is significantly greater emphasis on the structural reforms needed to improve the country’s
competitiveness. The GPRSP III sets out an ambitious structural reform agenda to improve the
efficiency of public sector investment and SOE service delivery, enhance the investment climate,
and reform the labor market to raise productivity and foster private sector development. Gender
is identified as a cross-cutting issue in the GPRSP III, with the Cabo Verde Institute for Gender
Equality and Equity (ICIEG) responsible for implementing its gender-related objectives. The
CPS and the GPRSP III are closely aligned across all these areas.
49.
A notable shift is the focus on eliminating extreme poverty through the development
and modernization of the agriculture and fisheries sectors, and promoting shared
prosperity by strengthening the linkages of the tourism sector with these primary sectors.
Because of the untapped potential of the agriculture sector, and, given the strong incidence of
extreme poverty in rural areas, the GPRSP III directs special attention to enhancing agricultural
productivity and its linkages with the tourism sector by, for example, increasing the use of Cabo
Verdean agriculture products by tourism operators. In addition, policies on human capital
development, in particular TVET, are priority areas to boost shared prosperity
50.
The GPRSP III supports the development of these seven economic clusters through
interventions organized under five areas of intervention, or axes:
17



Infrastructure. Policies under this axis are designed to alleviate remaining infrastructure
bottlenecks through completion of the Government’s public investment program in
energy, multi-modal transportation (seaports, airports and road transportation), and water
mobilization and irrigation facilities. The GPRSP III pays particular attention to
institutional and managerial reforms in the energy and transportation sectors, as
infrastructure assets in these sectors have been completed in the recent years.



Developing Human Capital. Interventions under this axis have two objectives: (a) to
create a more competitive labor force and ensure that growth is sufficiently inclusive to
improve income distribution; and (b) to strengthen Cabo Verde’s global competitiveness
in technology-intensive industries. Programs under this pillar are viewed as fundamental
for the promotion of sustainable and shared prosperity.



Good Governance. The objectives of this axis are to (a) bolster the country’s resilience
to adverse shocks by strengthening its macro-fiscal position; and (b) increase the
effectiveness of public service delivery, including new initiatives in critical areas such as
the national planning system, public investment management, the government-wide
M&E system, statistical development, and the oversight and reform of SOEs.



Support to the Private Sector. The overarching focus of the GPRSP III is to shift
responsibility for the country’s economic development to the private sector. This axis
includes specific measures to expand trade openness, improve the tax system, promote
financial sector stability, and enhance the overall business and investment climate, and
increased private sector participation in infrastructure service delivery. The GPRSP III
clearly depicts the Government’s role as a catalyst and facilitator of the new economic
model it proposes.



Development of Global Partnerships. In an environment of declining aid flows and
reduced access to concessional financing, Cabo Verde still requires intense resource
mobilization and technical assistance from both traditional and new partners. Hence the
GPRSP III calls for comprehensive plan to diversify sources of funding to include new
bilateral trading partners such as China, Brazil, the Middle East, and the West Africa
region.
IV.

WORLD BANK GROUP COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY

4.1. LESSONS LEARNED AND PROCESS OF CONSULTATION
The proposed CPS builds on the achievements of the previous CPS11. The Bank
51.
Group’s CPS for Cabo Verde and its program of support activities were designed to assist the
Government in achieving the higher-level development goals that were outlined in its second
Growth and Poverty and Reduction Strategy Paper for 2008-2011. The performance of the
previous CPS-supported program (FY09-FY12) was rated Moderately Unsatisfactory, mainly
due to slow implementation of pillar three (Strengthening Human Capital and Social Inclusion).
As detailed in Annex 4, substantial outcomes were achieved under pillar 1 (Promoting Good
Governance and Public Sector Capacity), and to some extent under pillar II (Improving
Competitiveness and the Investment Climate for Private Sector Growth).
52.
The approach of the CPS is informed by lessons learned from the implementation of the
previous CPS, including:
11

The previous CPS was not a joint a WBG product; it was only a World Bank product.

18



Use of instruments: Cabo Verde’s experience in transport and energy demonstrates how
policy reforms under the PRSC series, combined with operational support under
investment projects, can be mutually reinforcing. Going forward, the WBG should
continue the approach of combining sectoral policy work with investment projects.



Selectivity: Given the limited IDA/IBRD allocation for Cabo Verde, the WBG program
will be highly selective; a maximum of two operations per year would be the norm.



South-South cooperation: As an emerging middle-income country, Cabo Verde could
become a focal point for South-South learning. The Bank has already supported
successful exchanges on policy and institutional reform issues with Mauritius and
Seychelles, and on performance-based road management with Brazil, through the SouthSouth Exchange Trust Fund.



Statistics development: The WBG will continue to assist the Government in statistical
capacity building. Together with AfDB, the WBG is coordinating on the statistics
agenda through the multi-donor Budget Support Group.

53.
This CPS will build on the ongoing program (Table 4), which is composed of
investment operations in the infrastructure sectors (energy. transport), productive sector (e.g.,
fisheries) and private sector development, complemented by budget support. The portfolio is
performing well with zero problem or potential problem projects. The US$83 million portfolio
will be complemented by the new projects coming on stream under this CPS.

The preparation of this CPS was informed by broad in-country consultations with
the Government, civil society and the private sector. Apart from ongoing policy dialogue,
consultations took place during a CPS consultation mission in January 2014, during which WBG
staff presented the findings of the CEM and discussed the proposed CPS. Civil society and
private sector actors were consulted during a public forum held in Praia on January 22, 2014.

CPS is well aligned with Government Strategy – GPRSP III
Proposed program is potentially a transformative agenda for medium to long-term sustained
growth, and welcomed the new focus on tourism and agriculture sectors
Worried about the small IDA and IBRD allocation
Welcomed IFC increased role in Cabo Verde as this was not the case for past CPS
Welcomed the focus of the WBG on private sector development
Welcomed the WBG focus on tourism sector, as this remains by far the fastest growth sector, and
asked WBG to explore potential links between tourism and agriculture. Suggested consideration of
the fishery sector, which is potentially transformative
Diversifying the tourism base will improve competitiveness
Requested that WBG address the delays in VAT reimbursements
Called for expedited reform in air transport, notably increase the frequency of flights through
expanded open skies agreements and other measures to increase and facilitate access to the islands
Welcomed the reforms to the Labor Code and asked for sustained WBG support for this critical and
sensitive reform
Encouraged increased role of IFC under this CPS
Insisted on the need for the WBG to focus on improving the quality of public investments through
the introduction of a national investment system and results-based monitoring
Confirmed that proposed focus of the WBG in this CPS reflects its comparative advantage but
called for increased donor coordination, especially with those outside the Budget Support Group
(BSG), such as the UN agencies on the social agenda
Appreciated the WB’s leading role in the BSG and called for an expanded framework to harmonize
and coordinate the activities of donors in order to reduce conflicting advice to the Government
Appreciated the WBG’s possible support to the rural development and agriculture sectors, and
stressed the need for the Bank to support the fishery sector, which is potentially transformative
Increased attention needs to be paid to environment protection and sustainability

55.
Gender is identified as a cross-cutting issue in the GPRSP III, with the Cabo Verde
Institute for Gender Equality and Equity (ICIEG) responsible for implementing its gender-related
objectives. This CPS is informed by the Government’s gender assessment as presented in the
July 2013 Progress Report on Implementation of the Millennium Development 2010-2011-2012;
as well as by a Gender Portfolio Review12 conducted by the World Bank Africa Region Gender
Practice Group in 2013, the Country Economic Memorandum, and in-country consultations with
the ICIEG. The WBG regards these combined assessments and consultations as constituting a
full country gender assessment, as laid out in OP/BP 4.20. The findings and conclusions indicate
that the following issues require immediate attention: (a) improved water and sanitation for rural
women; (b) increased economic opportunities for young women in the formal sector; and (c)
technical and vocational education and training (TVET) for women. Since the Millennium
Challenge Corporation is addressing the water and sanitation issues and the Luxembourg
Cooperation is focusing on TVET, the WBG will focus on creating more economic
opportunities, especially for young women whose high levels of human development have yet to
be translated into equal opportunities in the formal sector, 13 through the proposed
12

The 2013 Cabo Verde Gender Portfolio Review, completed as a background paper for the CPS, provides an
overview of the current state of gender in the country as well as an assessment of the coverage of gender in the
World Bank portfolio.
13
The parity index for gross enrollment ratio in higher education in the academic years 2011/2012 was 1.42; i.e., for
every 142 women in higher education there were only 100 men. One third of women—33.5 percent—aged 15-24
years were unemployed in 2011, well above the overall unemployment rate of 27.1 percent, and 22.1 percent for
men of the same age . Also for the age group ≥ 15 years the rate of unemployment for women is 13.2 percent,
compared to 11.4 percent for men. Briefly, unemployment affects women more. (Source: Progress Report on
Implementation of the Millennium Development 2010-2011-2012).

20

Competitiveness for Tourism Development Project as well as the West Africa Agricultural
Productivity Program.
56.
The Gender Portfolio Review conducted by the World Bank Africa Region Gender
Practice Group in 2013 found that only 20 percent14 of the Bank’s portfolio for Cabo Verde
is gender informed. The review also looked at four Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA)
and found that only one out of four activities was gender informed. The low integration of
gender in the portfolio may be partly explained by the fact that Cabo Verde is already performing
well in the areas in which the WBG tends to be strong on gender mainstreaming, such as health
and education. However, more support is required in other areas, such as gender-based violence.
Gender-informed activities in the current portfolio include support to women-run MSMEs and a
gender-informed analysis of human capital and labor market issues. The Poverty and Gender
assessment to be carried out under this CPS will further inform the mainstreaming of gender in
projects supported by this CPS.
57.

The proposed CPS aims to increase the gender sensitivity of the portfolio by:




Increasing attention to gender in the area of economic opportunity through the proposed
program on competitiveness;
Increasing attention to gender empowerment through the program on agriculture
development;
Ensuring that future projects are consistent and coherent in addressing gender across
analysis, actions, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E).

4.2. WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR FY15-17
58.
The objective of the proposed CPS for FY15-17 is to provide a framework for
supporting the implementation of GPRSP III, as the previous CPS did for GPRSP II. The
proposed CPS will be structured around two complementary pillars: (a) enhancing macro-fiscal
stability, setting the foundations for renewed growth; and (b) improving competitiveness and
private sector development. This represents a continuation of the two successful pillars under the
previous CPS, with some adjustments, to respond to the country’s needs as articulated in the
GPRSP III. To the extent possible, the Bank, IFC and MIGA will carry out joint or
complementary programs in the transport and energy sectors that have great potential in terms of
PPPs. The Bank will focus on the policy agenda and IFC and MIGA will bring in their expertise
and financing tools for PPPs. In the tourism sector, IFC will complement the Bank’s
interventions by exploring financing for hotel operators as well as possible support to improve
the linkage between the tourism and agriculture sectors. The World Bank and IFC teams will
also work together on improving the investment climate. More detailed information per pillar
follows.
Pillar I: Enhancing Macro-Fiscal Stability – Setting the foundation for renewed growth
59.
As a small island economy, Cabo Verde is highly vulnerable to external
macroeconomic volatility. Its heavy reliance on tourism export receipts, FDI, and ODA makes
the country highly sensitive to changes in global market conditions and critical macroeconomic
buffers have been severely strained by the impact of the global financial and Eurozone crises.
Under its new growth model supported by this CPS, the Government will need to enhance
domestic resource mobilization and improve the cost-effectiveness of its spending.

14

This rate is well below the IDA-16 target of 60 percent of gender-informed activities.

21

60.
Link to the WBG twin goals: the objective of Pillar I is the enhancement of macrofiscal stability to support the authorities’ efforts to boost domestic resources and improve the
public investment system to ensure high-quality investment, in addition to reducing fiscal risks
and improving service delivery by promoting a set of priority reforms focusing on the
performance of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Activities under Pillar I are expected to create
some additional fiscal space, which in turn, if put to good use, could expand the ability of the
Government to invest in social sectors and accelerate human capital formation and raise the
employability of the labor force. The second objective of making public expenditures more
efficient is expected to reinforce these effects. Raising the quality of public spending can
improve service delivery, both coverage and quality, especially among those living in the islands
that benefit relatively less from tourism and are more dependent on agriculture. More and better
public services will enable a broader fraction of the population, particularly low and middle
income individuals, to benefit from more diversified growth, contributing to poverty reduction
and enhancing shared prosperity. Pillar I outcomes are summarized in Table 5; a more detailed
discussion, per outcome follows the table.

‐
‐

*Related WBG instruments are reflected in the Results Matrix (Annex 1)

61.
Outcome 1: Improved tax revenues: Cabo Verde’s attractiveness to private investment
has been enhanced by a generous system of fiscal incentives; however, this system has negative
implications for fiscal revenues. Building on the achievement of the previous series, the PRSCs
series will support the tax-policy agenda for 2014-15 to enable the tax authority to expedite
collection procedures, reduce tax evasion and accelerate the clearance of tax arrears.
62.
Outcome 2: Improved public expenditure efficiency: The public sector efficiency
reform agenda will focus on three main areas: (i) SOE reform; (ii) strengthening the national
public investment system is also critical to ensure that public resources are allocated to projects
with high rates of financial, economic and social returns; and(iii) continuation of PFM reforms.
63.
World Bank instruments include development policy operations, sector investments
and knowledge products.


The PRSCs series VIII-XI will be the main Bank instrument for the support to Pillar I.
Specific activities will include the preparation of result-based management contracts
between the MoFP and the major SOEs; the strengthening of the national investment
system (NIS) and the consolidation of major PFM reform, including the full use of the
electronic financial management system (SIGOF); the monitoring of fiscal liabilities
related to state-owned enterprises; and improved external audits and controls.

22



The Economic Governance/Public Sector Efficiency Project will strengthen the SOE
Unit (within the Ministry of Finance) capacity to monitor performance contracts,
including progress toward achieving financial and service delivery targets. It will also
support the implementation of the action plan prepared jointly by the World Bank and
IMF on the basis of the PEMFAR.



The ongoing IDA Transport Sector Reform Project (US$19 million) will support the
implementation of transport sector State Owned Enterprise (SOE) reform. This will be
complemented by IFC support for the development of selected PPP transactions.



The ongoing IBRD Electricity Sector Project (US$53.5 million) will continue to
support implementation of the performance contract for ELECTRA.

64.

Analytical work will include the following:


An SOE Policy Note will help analyze options to improve SOEs’ fiscal management and
service performance. This note will inform the preparation of the proposed Economic
Governance/Public Sector Efficiency Project.



An Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant will support implementation of the 3year action plan to enhance the efficiency of the NIS. The grant will also establish a
project appraisal unit at the Ministry of Finance, which will be responsible for screening
and selecting investment projects.

65.
Donor Coordination: In line with the division of labor among development partners (see
Annex 2), the World Bank is taking the lead on macroeconomic stability in coordination with
other Budget Support Group (BSG) members. Under the Memorandum of Understanding signed
with the Government in 200615, the BSG supports the Government’s current GPRSP III in ten
policy areas. BSG members conduct joint reviews twice a year, which reduce transaction costs
for the Government and promote harmonization. The Bank is the current BSG coordinator. The
BSG coordination mechanism has proven to be effective in facilitating the division of labor
among the BSG members. It has also helped improve donor harmonization. For example, in the
absence of an IMF program, the Bank has assumed the responsibility of providing
macroeconomic assessments to the other BSG members, in close coordination with the IMF’s
Washington-based team. The mechanism has also enhanced the Government’s ability to attract
additional external budget support. However, the BSG coordination mechanism will need to be
expanded to include non-BSG members. The WBG will work with the Government to further
integrate all active donors in the mechanism.
Pillar II: Improving Competitiveness and Private Sector Development
66.
Under Pillar II, the CPS supports the objective of improving competiveness and
private sector development by focusing on three areas: (a) improving investment climate, (b)
enhancing the performance of the tourism sector and agricultural productivity, and (c) supporting
enabling sectors (energy and roads).
67.
Link to the WBG strategic goals: enhancing competitiveness and the business climate
will improve the functioning of markets. In turn, complete and competitive markets are central to
achieving more efficient utilization of the productive assets of households, in particular their
labor and human capital. This is of high importance in the context of Cabo Verde, where the
unemployment rate has remained high, even in periods of strong economic growth—more than

half of the economically active population is employed in informal jobs; and labor force
participation is substantially lower among some groups of the population (women and youth),
despite increases in school enrollment and attainment. Improving the business climate, reducing
production costs (e.g. increasing the efficiency of the electricity sector), improving connectivity
through better management of the road network, and improving the productivity of critical
sectors (e.g. agriculture) will increase the accessibility of the poor to markets, strengthen the
demand for their labor. Pillar II outcomes are summarized in Table 6; a more detailed
discussion, per outcome follows the table.

agenda produced strong improvements in Cabo Verde’s business climate.
69.
World Bank Group instruments: This CPS will support further actions to improve the
investment climate, and instruments will include the PRSC series, sector specific projects as well
as participation of IFC.

70.



The PRSCs VIII-XI series will support the establishment of a single window system for
investments, which will significantly expedite the registry and licensing of operations by
foreign investors, and the provision of tax benefits.



Competitiveness for Tourism Development Project will assist the Government in
implementing investment climate reforms under the Government’s "Move to Compete"
program to improve competitiveness; including the strengthening of the investment
promotion agency, the establishment of a national tourism organization, and the creation
of an investment marketplace to encourage innovation in startups.



IFC is exploring financing for hotel projects to complement the WB’s investment in
the tourism sector. IFC will also work with a commercial bank to create a facility to
support trade under the IFC’s Global Trade Finance Program (GTFP), and a credit line
(or equity participation).
Analytical work and technical assistance will include the following:
24



Financial Sector Assessment Program. Building on the financial sector strategy
prepared with Bank’s support, the FSAP will carry out an in-depth review of financial
sector performance.



The Leveraging the Diaspora ESW will explore the scope for expanding the role of the
diaspora in developing the country's economy.

71.
Outcome 4a: Improved Electricity Sector Performance. With World Bank support,
the Government has implemented the key elements of a comprehensive reform program for the
electricity sector and the public electric and water utility, including a result-based management
contract.
72.
World Bank Group instruments: This CPS, through the series of PSRCs and ongoing
investment operations, will support further actions to improve operational efficiency in the
energy and transport sectors, including ELECTRA’s financial viability.


PRSCs series will continue to support policy reforms aiming at reducing
ELECTRA’s commercial and technical losses.



The ongoing IBRD Electricity Sector Project will support priority investments in the
electricity sector that will allow ELECTRA to meet the electricity needs of a growing
economy, including the extension of Palmarejo Power Plant in Praia (Island of Santiago),
and extension of Lazareto Power Plant in Mindelo (Island of Sao Vicente). The project
will also support additional water storage capacity.



Support to support renewable projects will be provided, under the WB/IFC new initiative,
Scale Up Solar energy, in a way that would help leverage other sources of funding (IBRD
funds, private investors, IFC lending and equity, carbon funds, etc.).

73.
Outcome 4b: Improved management of National Roads Network: with World Bank
support, steady progress has been achieved in the institutional reform of the road sector,
including the creation of a road maintenance fund, the establishment of a dedicated road agency
(Instituto de Estradas IE), and the introduction of a four-year performance-based rehabilitation
and maintenance contract (PBC).
74.
WBG instruments: this CPS will continue its support to the transport sector to
consolidate these achievements through a mix of World Bank and IFC instruments.


The ongoing IDA Transport Sector Reform Project will help improve efficiency and
management of its national road assets, and support reform of the transport sector SOEs.



IFC, together with MIGA, will complement this by supporting the implementation of
selected PPP transactions in the sector.



The PRSCs series will support the introduction of performance-based management tools
for maintenance of about 60 percent of the paved road network.

75.
Outcome 5: Increased agricultural productivity and linkages to markets: in order to
address current sector challenges and promote the role of agriculture as a fundamental sector for
poverty reduction and growth, there is a need to increase agricultural productivity.
76.

WBG instruments will include the following:


Cabo Verde will join the program under the regional West Africa Agricultural
Productivity Project for Capo Verde (WAAPP-1D) series whose objective will be to
generate and accelerate the adoption of improved technologies for the country’s key
25

agricultural commodities that are aligned with the sub-region’s top agricultural
commodity priorities.


The Competitiveness for Tourism Development Project will foster linkages with the
tourism value chain, including those in the fisheries and agriculture sectors.



IFC is exploring financing for hotel projects for which it will support linkages between
the tourism and the agriculture sectors.

77.

Analytical work will include:


An agriculture sector review will assess the agricultural sector in Cabo Verde through:
(a) a review of current agriculture sector strategies and policies; and, (b) an identification
of key intervention areas for value chain development based on the country's comparative
advantage in promising value chains. The study will highlight both poverty- and growthbased impacts of the proposed interventions, and will guide the preparation of the
proposed WAAPP-1D.

78.
Donor coordination: in line with the division of labor among development partners (see
annex 2), the WBG will focus on competitiveness and infrastructure development. This will be
done closely with the African Development Bank (AfDB). In the absence of other donors’
interventions, the WBG will explore new interventions in the agriculture sector, a cornerstone for
poverty reduction; and in the tourism sector as the leading driver of growth in Cabo Verde. For
other sectors with no WBG financing, such as human development, where the UN agencies, EU
and Luxembourg are leading, the WBG will play a supporting role by focusing on policy and
structural reforms through its PRSC series, and on selected knowledge products. Similarly, the
WBG will work closely with the Millennium Challenge Corporation and Japan, which are
leading on other infrastructure sectors, such as water and sanitation.
4.3. FINANCING OF THE PROGRAM
79.
The indicative IDA17 envelope is SDR 32 million, equivalent to US$49.5 million for
FY15-FY17 16 . Cabo Verde will also have access to IBRD resources during the CPS period.
IBRD lending limits will depend on country performance, IBRD's lending capacity, demand by
other borrowers and global economic developments. The indicative program is shown in Table 7.

16

Using the exchange rate 1.54563$/SDR. The actual exchange rate for each operation depends on the applicable
prevailing rate at the time of approval. The amounts shown in outer years are indicative only. Actual allocations will
depend on: (i) the total IDA resources available; (ii) the country’s performance rating, per capita GNI, and
population; (iii) the terms of IDA assistance (grants/credits); (iv) the allocation deductions associated with MDRI
annual debt service foregone as applicable; (v) the performance, other allocation parameters, and IDA assistance
terms for other IDA borrowers; and (vi) the number of IDA-eligible countries.

4.4. RISKS AND MITIGATION
80.
Implementation of this CPS will face three main types of risks: external, domestic
and operational. External risks are associated with the uncertain global economic scenario. The
recovery of the global economy remains anemic and uncertain, and there are significant
downside risks associated with major developed economies, especially the Eurozone. A further
deterioration in external conditions would have detrimental effects on Cabo Verde’s growth
trajectory and puts at risk the delivery of the development policy loans. This risk is rated
substantial. Together with the IMF (the country is under Article IV arrangement), the Bank,
through its PRSC series, will provide mitigation measures aimed at enhancing macro-fiscal
stability and the country’s resilience to both internal and external shocks. In addition, the Bank
will have flexibility in the type of financial instruments deployed to address changing country
conditions.
81.
A set of domestic risks arises from the private sector’s ability and willingness to
respond positively to the Government’s structural reform agenda. A pivotal assumption
behind the structural reforms supported by the PRSC series is that the private sector will become
the country’s primary engine of economic growth as the Government scales back its investment
program. However, it is unknown whether the incentives created by the Government’s strategy
will be sufficient to induce the level of private-sector growth that the strategy envisions; this
could potentially put at risk the reform program supported by this CPS. This risk is rated modest
as the robustness of the structural reform agenda, the active participation of the private sector in
the preparation of the GPRSP III and permanent dialogue between the Government and private
stakeholders should mitigate these risks. Through its focus on infrastructure development and
27

SOE reform, the proposed WBG programs, including the active role of IFC and MIGA, will
provide the financial and technical support and guarantees that will help crowd in private sector
participation.
82.
There are also political economy risks for sensitive reforms. Some of the proposed
reform operations under this CPS will require parliamentary approval and are likely to face some
resistance. The Government has been very effective in building consensus on the diagnosis of the
country’s development challenges and the need for reforms during the preparation of the GPRSP
III. But, given that the next national elections will be in 2016 making 2015 a pre-election year,
ambitious reforms will become less likely and the risk is substantial. The reform agenda to be
supported by this CPS, notably the PRSC series in FY15 and FY16, is being accompanied by a
communication strategy which involves representatives of the private sector, the managers of
SOEs, civil servants and other stakeholders.
83.
Finally, operational risks are still considerable. While by regional standards Cabo
Verde’s institutional and technical capacity is strong, the limited number of technical staff in
several core ministries poses substantial implementation risks. The reform of SOEs is
particularly challenging, as it involves special processes that are not routine for the relevant
agencies. To address these risks, the WBG and other development partners have made available
a combination of capacity building assistance, technical support and sector-specific investment
operations, which will substantially improve prospects for success in the reform areas supported
by this operation.

Annex 3: Statistics in Cabo Verde
Cabo Verde’s statistical development is weak for a middle income country. According to
the World Bank’s statistical capacity index, Cabo Verde scored 66 in 2013, above the averages
of 63 and 60 for IDA countries and Sub-Saharan African countries respectively, but well below
the IBRD average of 75. The main constraints include the lack of predictable funding, the
dependence on donor support for the implementation of surveys and censuses, and the scarce
human resource capacities associated with the small size and with the geographic fragmentation
of the country.
There are a number of shortfalls. The last household survey was performed in 2007 and a
national census was conducted in 2010 with the support of international development partners. A
light poverty study was conducted in 2012 as part of the preparation of the third edition of the
GPRSP III with the support of the World Bank. The preparation of official national accounts
was interrupted in 2008 and a new GDP series including recent years was only presented in
January 2013, updated to the UN accounting methodology of 1993. However, national accounts
data continue to be produced with a considerable time lag, beyond what is foreseen in national
law. Employment surveys are scarce and are, similarly, not released in a timely manner; the
latest information on unemployment rate corresponds to 2012. Cabo Verde does not have a
tourism satellite account which could provide thorough information on the most important
economic sector of the country.
The GPRSP III considers the National Statistics System, led by the national statistics
institute, INE, a fundamental pillar of the National System of Planning. Throughout 2012
and 2013, the government approved a set of decrees to define and strengthen the institutional
capacity of the National Statistics System including new statutes for INE and a new organic
structure, the establishment of the National Statistics Council; and complementary regulations
granting INE more power to collect information from public agencies and private sector. Several
donors, including the World Bank through the Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Building, as
well as the African Development Bank, the IMF, and bilateral donors are currently providing TA
to the INE.
For 2014, the main new outputs in terms of surveys from INE include the household survey
of expenses and revenues – which will provide critical data to update the poverty analysis; the
demographic and reproductive health survey which will update important health indicators
(pertinent also for MDG measuring); and the General Agricultural Survey, a comprehensive
operation that will provide critical data for fine tuning of agro-business policy decisions in this
critical primary sector as noted in the GPRSP III.

Annex 4: CPS Completion Report (FY09-12)
I – INTRODUCTION
A. Methodology
1.
This Country Partnership Strategy Completion Report (CPSCR) presents an assessment
of the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Cabo Verde for FY09-12, supported jointly by the
International Development Association (IDA) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD) – collectively “the Bank.” The report evaluates (a) the CPS support
program’s performance in achieving or influencing the objectives set out in the CPS results
matrix; and (b) the Bank’s performance in designing and implementing the program. Although
IFC did not participate in the CPS support program, IFC was active in projects to improve access
to finance to SMEs and infrastructure projects development during the period, which are noted in
the report.
2.
This self–assessment was conducted in line with the OPCS guidelines related to
“Assessing Country Partnerships Strategies: A shared approach” dated November 2013. Based
on the assessment, the overall CPS outcome is rated as moderately unsatisfactory as only Pillar 1
is rated satisfactory, while pillar 2 and 3 are both rated moderately unsatisfactory. The World
Bank performance is rated fair. As outlined in Table 1, Pillar 117 is rated satisfactory, as 2 of its
objectives were fully achieved and 1 mostly achieved; Pillar 2 is rated moderately unsatisfactory
with one objective out of 2 mostly achieved; and Pillar 3 is rated moderately unsatisfactory as
both of its objectives were only partially achieved.

B. Summary of Program and Bank Performance
3.
The Bank’s CPS for Cabo Verde and its program of support activities were designed to
assist the Government of Cabo Verde in achieving the higher-level development goals outlined
in its second Growth and Poverty and Reduction Strategy Paper (GPRSP II) for 2008-2011. The
overall Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU) rating is a weighted measure of progress made toward
achieving all major CPS objectives as detailed in Annex 1. Most CPS program activities were
concentrated under the GPRSP’s Pillar One, “Promoting Good Governance and Public Sector
Capacity.” Great strides were made during the CPS period to enhance the use of public resources
and its transparency, to better manage debt and strengthen the regulatory and oversight role of
the public administration. The program also carried out activities under Pillar Two,
“Improving Competitiveness and the Investment Climate for Private Sector-Led Growth.”
Under that pillar, program activities helped raise the country’s Doing Business ranking from
146th in 2010 to 122nd in 2012 mainly through the simplification of firms’ closure procedures,
reduction of registering costs and a more transparent and predictable investment code, and to
expand the administrative services readily available to citizen and investors. The program helped
to lay the foundation for development of the energy sector, and also contributed to satisfactory
progress in the road transport sector. Progress in the air transport sector, however, has been
modest and objectives are expected to appear in the next CPS. In the fisheries sector, the
program successfully established fisheries management tools and is on track to reach the
expected results. Under Pillar Three, “Strengthening Human Capital and Social Inclusion,” the
program partially achieved its goals. In the education sector and the technical and vocational
education and training (TVET) sector, the Bank’s program was limited to technical assistance
(TA); while investments were supported by other development partners (DPs) and, due to the
hard fiscal constraints, Government contributions have been limited. The program also supported
the Government’s social inclusion agenda through the establishment of legal centers staffed with
legal counselors. However, the planned evaluations of poverty, gender and other social impact
investments, as well as the household surveys for poverty, were not carried out. The four
Poverty Reduction Strategy Credits (PRSCs) over the three-year period (PRSCs IV-VII), have
provided a strong knowledge base for preparation of the next CPS.
4.
Bank performance and implementation are rated fair overall. The CPS program
design and objectives were relevant and well-aligned with the objectives of the GPRSP II. In
spite of the adverse environment following the global and euro crisis, particularly difficult for
CV and other small island economies, the Bank maintained a productive dialogue with the
Government throughout implementation of the program. The indicators in the results matrix
were, for the most part, appropriate to measure CPS objectives, although some had weak logical
links with those objectives and were not realistically aligned with the CPS timeframe. The
Bank’s program also included risk identification and mitigation efforts (see paras. 38-39), with
the provision of TA to assist the Government in weathering the impacts of the global financial
crisis and defining realistic targets for the CPS. As an active member of the Joint Budget Support
Group (BSG), 18 the Bank also played a key role in harmonizing the aid architecture in the

International Development Cooperation, and the World Bank.

35

country. Additionally, the Bank demonstrated timely flexibility by increasing its IDA allocation
for Cabo Verde to mitigate the reduction in concessional financing. An Independent Evaluation
Group (IEG) review of projects closed during the CPS period rated three out of four projects
Satisfactory. However, IEG noted that cost overruns reduced the value for money in two out of
three investment projects. IEG also found room for improvement in the design, implementation,
and use of monitoring and evaluation (M&E). Finally, the strong commitment of the Bank’s
country team ensured that the portfolio was managed proactively to quickly adjust to changing
circumstances within the targeted sectors.
C. Economic and Sociopolitical Context
5.
During the CPS period, Cabo Verde consolidated its position as a service-based
economy and graduated from Least Developed Countries, per the UN’s classification in 2007.
With a GNI per capita of US$3,540, the country is firmly placed in the lower-middle income
countries group, per the Bank’s classification.19 The effects of the global financial crisis and the
ongoing Eurozone crisis on Cabo Verde have been strongly negative. GDP growth dropped
from 6.2 % in 2008 to -1.3 % in 2009 and recovered modestly to 1.5 % in 2010. GDP growth
rate increased to 4 % in 2011, but the worsening of the Eurozone crisis has prevented the
consolidation of the recovery trend. GDP growth rate increased to 4 % in 2011, but the
worsening of the Eurozone crisis has prevented the consolidation of the recovery trend. Cabo
Verde’s GDP growth slowed again to 1.2% in 2012 and weak growth is also estimated for 2013
(0.5 %) and 2014 (2-3 %). The country’s development vision is rooted in the need to leverage its
geo-strategic position and its natural and cultural assets. Capital accumulation and the expansion
of the tourism industry have been the driving forces of the country’s economic growth. The
tourism sector accounts for around 20 % of GDP. Foreign direct investment (FDI) flows in the
tourism and real estate sectors represent more than 90 % of total FDI flows to the country.
Private investments have driven the rapid development of tourism facilities and related real
estate construction activities, while public investments have financed the development of
transportation infrastructure services and energy supply.
6.
Rapid economic growth during most of the 2000s has also translated into improved
social conditions. Poverty in Cabo Verde dropped from 37 % in 2000 to 27 % in 2010, and the
country is currently on track to achieve nearly all of its Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)
by 2015. In general, these successes are, however, weakened by relatively high unemployment in
the country, especially among vulnerable groups such as women and youth.
7.
The two most recent rounds of national elections, both held in 2011, brought about a
novel arrangement in Cabo Verdean politics. For the first time, the President and Prime Minister
are supported by the main opposing parties: the MpD (Movimento para a Democracia Movement for Democracy) and PAICV (Partido Africano da Independência de Cabo Verde African Party for the Independence of Cabo Verde), respectively. The transition and
subsequent power sharing exercise between the MpD and the PAICV have been going
smoothly. Although there are concerns that the two parties might have different visions of how

19

GNI per capita, Atlas method (current US$), World Development Indicators, 2011

36

to implement reforms, the country has so far benefited from the leadership of an administratively
competent Government in a stable political environment.
8.
This political stability and economic growth that have made possible CV’s transition to a
MIC (Middle Income Country) also bring new challenges including those related to debt
monitoring and access to concessional finance. During the CPS period, Cabo Verde experienced
a significant increase in its debt burden, with the public debt stock increasing from 67.9 % of
GDP in 2008 to 88 % in 2012. Based on a recent stochastic debt sustainability analysis (DSA)
prepared by the Bank team, the present trajectory of public debt is expected to remain sustainable
in the long term, but significant vulnerabilities will persist in the short and medium terms. The
declining access to concessional finance and rapid debt accumulation are expected to increase
borrowing costs and reduce the fiscal space needed to sustain high public investment rates. The
ongoing European sovereign debt crisis has already reduced FDI flows and FDI-funded private
investments. Additionally, the heavy reliance on an undiversified set of economic drivers, and
the small domestic labor pool and consumer market, limit the potential for economies of scale
across sectors. Other factors, such as high unit costs of core infrastructure and public goods
arising from indivisibilities in public goods supply, along with the high transport costs and
significant exposure to natural hazards characteristic of small island economies, could
compromise Cabo Verde’s natural capital, which is its main tourism attraction.
9.
Looking forward, the intensive capital accumulation and growth in the tourism
sector that enabled Cabo Verde to graduate from Least-Developed Country status is
unlikely to be sustainable in the longer term. Consequently, Cabo Verde faces what may be its
greatest development policy challenge to date: how to adapt its development model to its new
economic and financial circumstances, and still sustain high growth and competitiveness in the
face of its vulnerability to global macroeconomic fluctuations. During the CPS period, Cabo
Verde was able to effectively use fiscal tools to partially insulate itself from global shocks, and
to boost public investment while maintaining control over current expenditures. Going forward,
in order to meet the challenges of transitioning to MIC status, the Government must now build
the foundation for enhanced macroeconomic resilience and facilitate a new growth model that
encourages improved productivity and human capital development rather than physical
accumulation, while still closely monitoring its vulnerability to external shocks.
II – CPS Program Performance
A. Program Overview and Principles of Engagement
10.
The GPRSP II for 2008-2011 put strong emphasis on infrastructure and private
sector development to support growth and reduce poverty. In support of the GPRSP, the
CPS also focused on sustaining high levels of growth and reducing unemployment, poverty, and
inequality. The five strategic pillars of the GPRSP II were: (a) promotion of Government
reform; (b) development of human resources; (c) enhancing competitiveness; (d) investment in
the country’s economic infrastructure; and (e) strengthening social cohesion. The CPS support
program was articulated around three pillars: (a) promotion of good governance and public
sector capacity; (b) improving competitiveness and the investment climate for private sectorgrowth; and (c) strengthening human capital and social inclusion.
37

11.
The Bank delivered its technical and financial support program using a blend of
investment loans and a series of four Poverty Reduction Strategy Credits (Annex 2). Box 1
presents an overview of the PRSC series which accounted for 78 % of the total IDA lending. The
original indicative IDA envelope of SDR27 million (US$40 million equivalent) envisaged in the
CPS was reduced to SDR25.2 million (US$37.3 million) in FY10 as a result of the higher GNI
per capita and in line with the Performance-Based Allocation System. Under IDA16, Cabo
Verde’s IDA envelope was raised to SDR30.7 million (US$46 million equivalent). The initial
IBRD envelope of US$52.8 million remained unchanged during the period.
Box 1. Areas of Focus of the PRSC Series
Four PRSCs (IV-VII) were implemented over the course of the CPS period, and the joint work under these
operations helped to link the policy reforms with enhanced public financial management. Under PRSC IV (which
supported the last year of GPRSP I implementation and enabled continued policy dialogue with the Government
during preparation of GPRSP II), the Government made progress in promoting good governance and improving
health and education outcomes. PRSC V through PRSC VII supported four main policy areas namely (i) good
governance; (ii) human capital enhancement; (iii) competitiveness; and (iv) infrastructure. PRSC VI-VII explicitly
had all the four main policy areas while PRSC V only highlighted (i) good governance; and (ii) competitiveness
and growth. However, human capital enhancement, and infrastructure were embedded as pillars, often with
benchmark indicators, in the program supported by PRSC V. Reforms in the pillar on social cohesion included in
PRSC V were dropped. PRSC V had included this area to align itself with the Government’s GPRSP II. However,
as the Government increasingly considered this area as cross-cutting, the series was already wide-ranging, and this
component was rather weak, the team for PRSC VI and VII decided to abandon it.
The joint Bank-development and Government work under the PRSC series also made it possible for the country to
maximize the return on its public investments, by: (a) linking medium-term investment planning to long-term
strategic objectives; (b) improving the selection of public investment; (c) integrating financial management
systems into performance contracts; and (d) establishing transparent procurement measures to track the quality of
investments.
The supervision of the PRSCs was through the donor Budget Support Group’s biannual missions which focused on
the monitoring of prior actions and brought together experts from the country’s priority sectors. The missions
evaluated progress on the joint matrix, facilitated coordination, and built consensus among donors.

12.
The Analytical and Advisory Assistance (AAA) program comprised policy notes and
core diagnostic assessments (see annex 3) that provided targeted and just-in-time policy support
on key issues in the infrastructure, social, and financial sectors. With a total net grant amount
close to US$8.2 million, the Trust Funds program was fully integrated into investment lending
activities and significantly supported the Bank’s analytical program.
13.
Four projects were closed over the course of the CPS (see Table 2), and all had
identical IEG and ICR ratings. The PRSC IV and the Growth and Competiveness Project were
both rated Satisfactory; the HIV/AIDS Project was rated Moderately Satisfactory; and the
Energy and Water Sector Reform and Development Project was rated Unsatisfactory, due to its
failure to enhance the supply, efficiency, and management of water and electricity in Cabo
Verde, and to inadequate Bank supervision. Both the ICR and IEG ratings for M&E design,
implementation, and utilization were modest except in the case of the Growth and
Competiveness Project, where M&E had the rare rating of Substantial.

The Bank’s post-CPS portfolio includes a total of four investment projects, in the
Energy, Transport, Fisheries, and Finance and Private Sector Development sectors.
Overall, planned activities have been implemented in a timely manner and all four projects are
on track to achieve results. The PRSC VIII, with a net commitment of US$12 million over the
period July-December 2012, has substantially achieved its objectives, according to a preliminary
assessment. Progress toward the achievement of Project Development Objectives and the overall
Implementation Progress are in the satisfactory range.
B. CPS Program Performance by Strategic Pillar
15.
The three strategic pillars of the CPS program were organized around seven
objectives, as measured by 36 indicators. The assessment presented here is based on the selfassessments (Achieved, Mostly Achieved, Partially Achieved, Not Achieved) in the CPS results
matrix, as updated in the CPS Progress Report (CPSPR).20 More details are presented in Annex
1.
CPS Pillar 1 – Promoting Good Governance and Public Sector Capacity
16.
Pillar 1 is rated satisfactory as the three objectives of Pillar 1 were fully or mostly
achieved.
17.
Objective 1: Reduced and better managed liabilities. The two indicators of this
objective were fully achieved. This outcome was achieved through successful implementation of
the PRSC series and the TA on debt management. The Government cleared all of the arrears
identified in 2005 by the end of the CPS period. Also, ELECTRA, the public electricity and
water utility company, has restructured its arrears and reestablished access to suppliers’ credit.
To improve the management of liabilities, the Bank also carried out a new public expenditure
management and financial accountability review (PEMFAR), and worked closely with the
Government to ensure adoption of the public financial management (PFM) reform agenda. The
20

An outcome is considered Achieved if the program fully achieved the Objective during the CPS period (e.g. all
the quantitative targets were met). An outcome is considered Mostly Achieved if the program made good progress
towards achieving the Objective during the CPS period (e.g. more than half of the quantitative targets were met and
the program is on track to meet the remainder of the targets). An outcome is considered Partially Achieved if the
program made only limited progress toward achieving the Objective during the CPS period (e.g. less than half of the
quantitative targets were met). An outcome is considered Not Achieved if the program made little progress toward
achieving the Objective during the CPS period (e.g. few if any of the quantitative targets were met). See Annex
Table 1 for details.

39

Bank also supported the preparation of the first Medium Term Debt Strategy in 2011 which lays
the main orientations for Government borrowing in the next years in which a reduction of
concessional financing is expected and an increase in access to international markets.
18.
Objective 2: Strengthened management of public resources at central and local
levels. The four indicators of this objective were fully achieved. Considerable progress has been
made in rationalizing Government structures with the definition and harmonization of internal
structures for all the Ministries, establishing principles for a merit-result oriented civil service
through the career plan and improving the efficiency of public finance management (PFM). A
commitment to enhanced budget credibility, supported by continuous improvements in
preparation, execution and reporting, has substantially increased the reliability and efficiency of
public expenditures, as well as the transparency and accountability of the budget process. The
introduction of a Medium Term Fiscal Framework (MTEF), and key reforms to the legal
framework for Government procurement, combined with ongoing efforts to strengthen the
capacity of agencies involved in public procurement, have been among the most notable
achievements made under good governance pillar. It should be noted that these achievements
were also supported by the European Union (EU), the African Development Bank (AfDB),
Spanish Cooperation, and the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), which provided muchneeded technical assistance and resources, in particular working in close collaboration with the
public procurement agencies.
19.
Substantial institutional strengthening at the municipality level was achieved through
implementation of a municipal information system (SIM). The SIM, which serves as a
management and communication tool between the central level and the municipalities, and
among the municipalities themselves, enabled the central and local Governments to streamline
processes related to revenue collection and management, land management, human resources,
and other administrative activities. It also enabled municipal Governments to improve the
timeliness of their audited accounts; the court of auditors reported that 14 out of 22
municipalities were audited in 2011. Further, the Bank’s Public Investment Program technical
assistance helped the Government to improve management of its public investment program by
more closely aligning the program with the objectives supported by the GPRSP II and the
Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF).
20.
Objective 3: Strengthened public administration regulatory and oversight role. Two
out of the six indicators under this objective were fully achieved. The delay between budget
execution and auditing of the State accounts has been reduced to two years, down from three
years in 2008. The PRSC series supported the establishment of the Government wide
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) System which has served as the foundation of a results-based
management system. The preparation of the Third Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(GPRSP III) has benefited from the M&E system and all its programs have a result framework
and their implementation is closely monitored and linked to the financial execution of projects.
21.
Overall, the selection of indicators was broadly appropriate to capture the progress
made under this pillar, and targets were largely met. For instance, the indicator on “use of
updated indicators by Government in planning and monitoring” encouraged the Government to
adopt a results-based approach to monitoring public investments.
40

CPS Pillar 2 – Improving Competitiveness and the Investment Climate for Private Sector-Led
Growth
22.
Pillar 2 is rated moderately unsatisfactory as one of the two objectives was mostly
achieved and the other partially achieved.
23.
Objective 1: Improved business climate. Four out of the five indicators were fully
achieved. The Bank assistance helped Cabo Verde to rise from 143rd in the Doing Business
rankings in 2008 to 122nd in 2012 (better than the original target of 132nd). Investment climate
reforms were aimed at reducing bureaucratic hurdles and the cost of doing business, and
included tax reforms, removal of administrative barriers, establishment of regulatory agencies,
and private sector and institutional capacity building. From 2009 to 2011 an aggressive reform
agenda for this area produced strong improvements in Cabo Verde’s business climate that have
been reflected in the 2011 and 2012 Doing Business Reports. Cabo Verde was selected in the
2011 and 2012 DB reports as one of the top 10 countries that have made significant progress in
improving the ease of doing business, improving twenty-five positions from the 146th position in
2010 to the 122nd in 2012. Both the PRSC series and the Growth and Competitiveness Project
supported strengthening of the investment climate. The latter targeted private sector
stakeholders, while the former largely supported policy reforms. At the closure of the Growth
and Competitiveness Project, to speed up the pace of reforms and improve access to finance,
the Bank agreed to prepare the SME Capacity Building and Economic Governance project,
which supported the reduction of the number of days it takes to receive a business license and the
cost of registering property.
24.
The Bank also supported the reform agenda associated with Cabo Verde’s accession to
the World Trade Organization (WTO) reached in 2008. Within this agenda, the PRSC series
supported the adoption of a new customs code in 2009, the law on intellectual property in 2010
and the approval of a new investment code in 2012. The full implementation of the WTO
agreements is expected to enable Cabo Verde to attract greater foreign investment inflows and
level the playing field for business with the elimination of subsidies and fiscal incentives to
specific sectors.
25.
Objective 2: Improved access to and quality of key economic infrastructure services.
Only four out of eleven indicators under this objective were fully achieved, hence this objective
was only partially achieved. The design of the Energy and Water Sector Reform and
Development Project was too ambitious, as both sectors lacked adequate institutional and
regulatory, technical and managerial frameworks. Nonetheless, the project helped to push
forward and shape the reform agenda in both sectors. The Bank’s engagement in the electricity
and water sectors continued with the project on Recovery and Reform of Electricity Sector,
which addresses the country’s chronic energy shortage Effective since May 2012, the project
aims to increase electricity generation on the islands of Sao Vicente and Santiago, and to assist
ELECTRA in reducing losses on Santiago. The Road Sector Support Project successfully
established a road maintenance fund, estimated at Escudos 500 million (about US$6 million).
New investments in rural roads significantly improved the mobility level of several small rural
communities. The West Africa Regional Fisheries Program is on track to achieve and even
surpass the objectives set at the design stage. For instance, the project has made considerable
41

progress in registering domestic fishing vessels by working closely with the Operational Nucleus
for the Information Society (NOSI), an e- government system. Considering the post CPS period,
we would like to underscore that three more indicators have since been fully or mostly achieved
(Financial viability of ELECTRA, quality of the road network, and wind energy installed)
although they were not accounted for in rating this CPS in line with OPCS guidelines.
ELECTRA’s financial performance significantly improved in 2013 and will continue to do so in
2014. The “quality of the road network improved by increasing the proportion of roads rated fair
to good condition” will surpass the 55% target by October 2014. And when smaller windmills
installed in other islands such as Santo Antao are taken into account, the “wind energy installed”
indicator will also have been achieved.
26.
In addition to the Bank’s involvement in the energy, water, road, and fishery sectors
under Pillar 2, IFC financed activities to improve access to finance for SMEs and for
infrastructure projects development. In SME finance, an IFC credit line of EUR 5 million
helped the publicly owned commercial bank, Caixa Economica de Cabo Verde (CECV), to
increase its loan book and provide more private sector financing. IFC also supported the
development of a credit bureau and a leasing program as alternative sources of finance for SMEs.
In infrastructure, IFC financed the expansion of cellular telephone networks, which increased
mobile phone penetration to 83 % in 2012 from 22 % in 2008. All 10 major islands now have
expanded coverage. In addition, the communication tariffs were brought down to about US$0.10
per minute, compared to US$1 in 2008.
27.
The achievement of objectives under Pillar 2 was complicated by the fact that it
encompassed several distinct sectors. Considerable progress was made in the energy sector
over the course of the CPS, despite some slippages. In the road sector project, there was a
disparity between the baseline in the CPS and the project baseline; and the target in the CPS
results matrix was higher than the one in the project document as per the Implementation Status
and Results Report (ISR). In the fisheries sector, the indicators were not specific or time
sensitive.
CPS Pillar 3 – Strengthening Human Capital and Social Inclusion
28.
Pillar 3 is rated moderately unsatisfactory as one of the two objectives was only partially
achieved.
29.
Objective 1: Better positioning of the education and TVET sectors to meet the needs
of the labor market. Only one indicator out of three for this objective was fully achieved. The
Bank carried out analytical work to inform policymaking in the TVET sector, and financial
support for the expansion of the TVET supply has been provided by the Dutch Cooperation
(from 2008 to 11) and by the Luxemburg Cooperation (from 2012 onwards). Up to 2010 the
delivery of technical and vocational courses increased substantially from 1,500 beneficiaries in
2008 to 5,200 in 2010. Supported by the Dutch Cooperation, the Training Support Fund (TSF)
reactivated in 2009 played an important role in the expansion of TVET courses. In 2010, 55
projects involving 11 public and private providers had been financed in the amount of about
€550,000 for the period 2009-2010, very close to the €600,000 target for the period.
Good
progress was also obtained on the institutional arrangements of the TEVET sector. In 2011, the
42

Government approved new statutes for the Employment and Professional Training Institute
(IEFP) and for the publicly funded Employment Centers (ECs). The integration of vocational
training programs and ECs under the new IEFP model would ensure that vocational training is
better attuned to the needs of private employers, indeed the private sector has been involved in
consultations on qualifications and courses. The Government also introduced a national
qualification framework to ensure the quality of training is consistent with international
benchmarks, namely the system applied in the EU. Finally, the certification/accreditation system
for TVET programs was operationalized and new 7 training centers were certified in 2011-2012.
30.
However, fiscal constraints and the end of the Dutch cooperation program interrupted the
expansionary trend observed until 2010. The number of beneficiaries of TVET actions dropped
from 5,150 trainees in 2010 to 2,300 in 2011 and further to 1,552 in 2012. This drop also resulted
from the Government’s decision to put on hold the TSF in 2011 while new regulations and
financial arrangements to ensure its financial sustainability were defined at the end of 2012. In
2013, the Government capitalized the TSF and it is expected that the number of beneficiaries will
recover in the short run.
31.
Objective 2: Improved targeting of public expenditures and specific programs.
Three out of the five indicators of this objective were achieved. The TA on access to justice,
financed by the Japan Social Development Fund, supported the social inclusion agenda. It
provided the most vulnerable groups with access to basic legal advice in the most pressing legal
issues. Four new legal centers became operational increasing the number to eleven. Communities
and community leaders have thus received legal literacy training and legal counseling by trained
paralegals in the eleven legal centers. The HIV/AIDS project aimed to reduce the spread of
HIV/AIDS infection in Cabo Verde but it was challenging to ensure political commitment to
target vulnerable populations.
32.
Financed by the Capacity Development for Poverty Work & PRSPs in African Countries,
the Bank supported the Government efforts on the building-up of the Government’s M&E
system to assess progress in the GRPS-2. The grant activities encompassed the preparation of a
Diagnostic Report of the M&E system, workshops on M&E, impact evaluation, Software
Platform for Automated Economic Analysis (ADePT) and Poverty Map which supported the
definition of outcome indicators for the GPRSP III and are expected to improve the targeting of
Government programs.
33.
The implementation of household living standards surveys for poverty indicators
and diagnostic of the incidence of key public programs has not been carried out by the
National Statistical Institute (INE) which suffers from a shortage of financial and human
resources. Once the activities envisioned under the Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Building
begin, they will be able to address some of INE’s limitations. Indeed, the project will support
training on sampling techniques, revision of survey tools, data bank management and civil
registration data analysis to name a few.
34.
The indicators under this pillar are mostly linked to AAA products and the PRSC
series making it difficult to discern the direct impact of the Bank’s assistance. As a case in
point, the change in the indicator ‘%age of secondary school pupils of the third cycle proceeding
43

to technical school increased from base of 13.8 in 2008 to 14.1 % in 2012’ is attributable to the
financing the Bank provided to the GoCV through the PRSC series. The Bank solely relied on
the Government’s commitment to allocate some of the funding from the budget support line to
the education sector but the budget allocation for education did not meet the target. Moreover,
the AAA products focused on the diagnostic aspect of the issues while the GoCV and other DPs
(under the umbrella of the Budget Support Group) were expected to carry out the activities to
allow a better positioning of the education and TVET sectors for the labor market. For the
indicator “Increase in number of vocational trainees to 8,000 by 2012” training had mainly been
supported by a Training Support Fund (TSF) set up with financial support from the Dutch
Government. In 2011 the Dutch Government withdrew from the sector and the GoCV has not
been able to finance the TSF. Although the Bank supported the Government’s strategy in this
sector through a Higher Education AAA, highlighting how higher education can support the
economic and social transformation agenda in Cabo Verde, there was no investment project to
impact the change in number of vocational trainees. Finally, the HIV/AIDS project lacked
baseline data for key indicators, which complicated the process of results-oriented project
management.
C. Overall CPS Assessment
35.
The CPS program broadly delivered the major expected objectives across the three
strategic pillars. Under Pillar 1, most of the planned public reforms were achieved. Under Pillar
2, progress was made in the transport and energy sectors, and the private sector development
agenda was advanced. Under Pillar 3, some progress was made in the social inclusion agenda,
but activities to strengthen human capital fell short of the expected results. There were some
minor shortcomings, such as the lack of clear and logical connections between Bank projects and
some of the outcome indicators, which weakened the results matrix. On balance, the CPS
performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.
III - BANK PERFORMANCE
36.
Evaluation of the Bank’s performance focuses on two key dimensions: (a) design of the
program; and (b) implementation of the CPS program.
A. CPS Design and Relevance
37.
The FY09-12 CPS was well-aligned with the development priorities underscored in
the GPRSP II. The Bank continued to concentrate its financial resources in selected areas within
the three pillars of the CPS so as to achieve transformational change over time. The areas of
engagement of the CPS were well aligned with those of the GPRSP II, including a strong
emphasis on energy, infrastructure, and private sector development. The Bank was commended
by the two main Chambers of Commerce (Sotavento and Barlavento) for its successful
engagement with small and medium enterprises through the matching grants program. The
timeframe for project implementation was mostly adequate. Among the Bank’s client countries,
Cabo Verde is a strong performer with demonstrated Government capacity on structural reforms.
Thus, the choice of the PRSC series as the main lending instrument supported by investment
projects in the critical sectors was adequate.

44

38.
Overall, the expected objectives were well defined and appropriate. However, the
results framework could have been strengthened by omitting results that were not expected to be
achieved over the CPS period. The implementation of some activities was delayed due to internal
Bank procurement and legal procedures. A more realistic assessment of preparation time and
implementation readiness could have helped to set achievable target values for some of the
indicators. The flexibility in the choice of AAA products provided the Bank with the tools to
effectively respond to the Government’s demands throughout the CPS period, including with a
Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review, and knowledge products
to support policymaking in education and transport.
B. Implementation of CPS Support Program
39.
The Bank team demonstrated a high level of commitment to implementing the
projects in the CPS portfolio; and the PRSC series successfully supported broader structural
reforms in public financial management. However, changes in the program’s leadership and lack
of coordination among project implementation units somewhat impeded the transfer of
experience and knowledge gained from earlier projects. In the area of private sector
development, for instance, the design of the SME Capacity Building and Economic Governance
Project did not build on the lessons learned from implementation of the Growth and
Competitiveness Project. Further, some of the indicators were not well aligned with the
specificities of the country’s FDI landscape.
40.
The Analytical and Advisory Assistance program was responsive to the client’s
needs and focused on the priority issues of infrastructure development, public sector
effectiveness, and private sector competitiveness. The analytical portfolio consistently
informed the design of new projects. As a case in point, the design of the new transport project
built on the findings of the Air Transport Diagnostic AAA. In addition, the Bank – cognizant of
the weak institutional capacity in the energy and water sectors, and in preparation of the current
IBRD project on Recovery and Reform of the Electricity Sector – supported in-depth analytical
work on institutional arrangements in those sectors through the Public-Private Infrastructure
Advisory Facility (PPIAF)’s TA program for ELECTRA. The Poverty Assessment TA informed
the dialogue on reforming targeted social assistance, while the Financial Sector Assessment
Program identified areas for strengthening banking supervision. The Initial Labor Market
Assessment reviewed constraints in the labor market, and provided grounds for optimism
regarding net job creation and integration of the national labor market. The TA for the Public
Investment Program helped develop the Government's capacity to routinely evaluate the poverty,
gender, and other social impacts of investments. The PEMFAR provided important inputs to the
policy dialogue under the PRSC series.
41.
Effective country team involvement in implementing the program helped to
maintain the focus on development objectives despite the adverse effects of the global and
then the euro crisis. The smooth implementation of the program at the project level benefited
from the strong commitment of the country team coupled with multiple supervision visits from
the project TTLs and ongoing dialogue with the Project Implementation Unites (PIUs). However,
internal Bank fiduciary (procurement and financial management) processes delayed the

45

implementation of several projects over the course of the CPS. The cost of implementation
exceeded the initial allocation for the Growth and Competitiveness and HIV/AIDs projects.
42.
The Bank was highly responsive to the changing priorities and demands of the
Government. The team’s flexibility was key to achieving salient objectives not initially
included in individual project designs. For instance, the Growth and Competitiveness Project did
not include the design of a Strategic Plan for the Chamber of Commerce of Cabo Verde. Yet the
Bank team foresaw the value of creating a strategic plan for the Chamber of Commerce, and
worked with the PIU to include it in the project’s activities. The strategic plan has since guided
the work and increased the efficiency of the Chamber of Commerce. The Bank’s responsiveness
was also demonstrated by the West Africa Regional Fisheries Program which added a
component to upgrade the port of Praia to make it suitable for exports towards Europe. This will
bring to two the number of ports certified to serve the European Union market, the first one
being the port of Mindelo in San Vicente.
43.
The use of the CPS Progress Report (CPSPR) to introduce course correction and
update the results matrix was broadly satisfactory. As requested by the World Bank
Executive Directors at the time of the CPS Board discussion, the CPSPR was completed before
the completion of the first two years of the CPS to provide the necessary course correction in
light of the global economic crisis. To make the changes inclusive and relevant, the review
process included consultations with private sector stakeholders and civil society. The CPSPR
included new indicators to replace those unlikely to be achieved, and adjusted those whose
targets had already been achieved by increasing target values. Some outcome indicators were
not adequately revised to reflect changing sector and project contexts, such as implementation
delays and shifting Government priorities. Overall, the Bank’s strategy remained unchanged,
with only minor adjustments to the timing and amount of credits disbursed. The CPSPR also
recognized that the initial objectives of GPRSP II, to reduce unemployment below 10 %, attain a
real economic growth rate above 10 %, and cut poverty by half, were too ambitious in view of
the global crisis.
44.
The Bank’s efforts to enhance the overall value of donor assistance were highly
effective. In accordance with the Paris Declaration for Aid Effectiveness, the Bank joined other
major bilateral and multilateral donors to harmonize their budget support around a mutually
agreed-upon policy matrix aligned with the Government’s GPRSP II. During the implementation
of the CPS, the Bank contributed to the Budget Support Group (BSG) with an envelope of
US$37 million, and coordinated the activities of the group in 2012. In that capacity, and in the
absence of an IMF program in Cabo Verde, the Bank has been providing macroeconomic
assessments to the other BSG members since June 2012.21 The ongoing Country Economic
Memorandum (CEM) will further support the Government’s macroeconomic agenda.
In
addition, the Bank played a key role in ensuring strategic coherence of donor support in the
public finance, roads, and energy sectors through policy dialogue and technical support. The
Bank is continuing to lead the discussions within the Budget Support Group regarding the
definition of a new common matrix for the 2013-16 GPRSP III.

21

The last IMF Policy Support Instrument (PSI) closed in February 2012.

46

45.
Sustained dialogue and smooth implementation of the CPS strengthened the already
good partnership between the Bank and the Government. The Bank has a good reputation
among Government counterparts and PIUs. As a member of the Budget Support Group, the
Bank’s work was further reinforced by the unified communication system. In fact, under the
unified communication system, the GoCV only deals with one interlocutor on the donors’ side in
charge of consolidating the views of all the DPs.
46.
Risk identification and corresponding mitigation measures played a key role in the
overall achievements of the program. At the CPS design stage, the Bank identified the global
economic slowdown and the euro crisis as risks that could hamper achievement of the country’s
development objectives. The measures recommended in the CPS22 helped to mitigate these risks.
The Poverty Assessment identified additional mitigation measures for vulnerable groups. The
CPSPR was then used to review and adjust the program’s development objectives. The risk of
political interference with major structural reforms in the infrastructure sectors was accounted for
by setting realistic objectives indicators. To mitigate the risks pertaining to contingent liabilities,
the CPS provided targeted support to the energy sector through ELECTRA’s recapitalization;
supported the strengthening of the Economic Regulation Agency (ARE) which regulates public
agencies; and helped identify sustainable Public Private Partnerships in the SMEs sector.
47.
The weak administrative capacity in the public sector was offset with capacitybuilding activities and technical support from the BSG. As the prospect of declining
concessional financing became palpable, the Government included only firm agreements rather
than notional commitments in its budget and medium-term framework. Via the PRSC series, the
Bank increased its IDA financing for Cabo Verde, with a total allocation of US$46 million for
IDA 16. In FY 11 the Bank also made available US$12 million in unused IDA resources within
the Africa Region to Cabo Verde. Using its convening power, the Bank also encouraged donor
partners to maintain concessional commitments to the country.
C. Bank Performance Rating
48.
The overall design of the strategy was adequate and well aligned with Cabo Verde’s
GPRSP II goals. However, some of the outcome indicators could have been better designed
to capture the impacts attributable to the Bank. The Bank can be commended for its
substantial level of proactivity, the good dialogue maintained with the Government throughout
CPS implementation, and the strong focus on results. However, the monitoring and evaluation
aspect of the program fell short in terms of timely results reporting and adjustment of indicators.
The good performance of the current portfolio and the strong commitment of the country team
have laid the groundwork for good results in the next strategy period. Therefore, the World Bank
Group performance is overall rated as fair.

22

The mitigation measures included Cabo Verde’s build-up of sizable international reserves in recent years; its
standing line of credit with the Central Bank of Portugal; continued monitoring of its macroeconomic situation
under the IMF PSI, and after it was discontinued, by the Bank; its access to budget support from the BSG donors;
and the country’s solid track record of proactive economic management and timely adjustment to shocks.

47

IV- KEY LESSONS LEARNED AND SUGGESTIONS FOR THE NEXT CPS
A. CPS Design and Focus
49.
The results matrix needs to be aligned only with objectives of projects in the
portfolio, and not with objectives dependent on external factors. In Pillar 2, some of the
indicators linked to the completion of reforms were not updated in the CPSPR, which led to
difficulties during the evaluation. In fact, the design of reforms was ambitious and not time
sensitive. Pillar 3 was supported mainly by non-lending activities, without any Bank investment
projects to carry out the recommendations arising from the analytical work. This made it difficult
during the evaluation to attribute changes to the Bank’s involvement, particularly since the
objectives were achieved as a result of other donor activities and the Government’s commitment
to invest in economic infrastructure.
50.
The Bank’s focus on the critical energy sector was appropriate, and should
continue, building on the knowledge gained from its involvement in the sector over the years.
The Bank turned the unsatisfactory performance of the Energy and Water Sector Reform and
Development Project into a learning opportunity, 23 and began to focus on institutional
strengthening. For example, the Bank encouraged the Government to adopt performance-based
contracts, strengthen the collection system through the use of smart metering, and reform the
management of the sector. The lessons learned from all of these actions subsequently guided the
design of the Recovery and Reform of the Electricity Sector Project which is currently rated
Satisfactory.
51.
As an emerging middle-income country, Cabo Verde could become a focal point for
South-South learning. The Bank has already supported a successful exchange on policy and
institutional reform issues between Cabo Verde and Mauritius through the South Experience
Exchange Trust Fund. Based on this experience, the Bank could assist Cabo Verde in facilitating
South-South exchanges on sectoral reforms and on the provision of guidance to low-income
countries.
52.
Going forward, stronger institutional capacity building will be necessary as Cabo
Verde develops its IBRD portfolio. Bank-financed projects could include stronger institutional
capacity building activities to strengthen the sector ministries. The National Planning
Department, housed in the Ministry of Finance, has strong implementation capacity, but other
ministries generally have weak capacity, particularly in the collection, evaluation, and
dissemination of the data needed to monitor their projects and programs.
B. CPS Implementation
53.
There is a lack of economies of scale due to the small size of the country. Better
resource management will be necessary in the future, and the country team could leverage the
resources of the Dakar Country Office to continue to maintain close dialogue with the
Government of Cabo Verde as the IBRD portfolio in the country increases.
23

The Bank paid closer attention to regulatory strengthening, tariff policy, institutional arrangements, and
strengthening the financial position of ELECTRA.

48

54.
Cabo Verde’s experience in transport and energy demonstrates how policy reforms
under the PRSC series, combined with operations support under investment projects, can
be mutually reinforcing. Going forward, the Bank should continue the approach of combining
sectoral policy work with investment projects.
55.
The Bank should continue to assist the Government in statistical capacity building.
Targeted assistance could build on the work started under two of the expected objectives this
CPS and include (a) providing funding to the National Statistics Institute (INE) for the
“Implementation of household living standards surveys for poverty indicators and diagnostic of
the incidence of key public programs”; and (b) focusing on the social sector to allow “Public
investment programs to routinely evaluate poverty, gender and other social impacts of
investments.”

 Generation capacity increased by 50 % during
2008-12, with the share from renewable energy
rising from 3% to15% by 2012. Actual: The
generation capacity was 73.9MW in 2008 and
116MW in 2012, which is a 57% increase. The
share of renewable energy generated was 16% in
2012. This indicator was achieved.
 The generation capacity was 73.9 MW in 2008.
30MW of additional heavy fuel oil generation
capacity contracted by 2012. Actual: Heavy fuel
oil generation capacity was above 30MW in
2012. This indicator was achieved.
 Financial viability of ELECTRA significantly
strengthened by 2012, as evidenced by an
increase in the debt service coverage ratio from
0.3 in 2008 to 1.1 by 2012. Actual: The DSCR
for 2012 was either 0.4 or 1.4 depending on the
inclusion or not in the debt service calculation of
a major bond refinancing which happened in that
year. Substantially, ELECTRA remains
financially dependent from Government support,
but its performance is improving thanks to the
measures put in place by the GoCV and the
utility (tariff adjustments, improved revenue
collection, investments, efficiency drive…).
ELECTRA’s financial performance significantly
improved in 2013 and will continue to do so in
2014. This indicator was not achieved by end of

Lessons and Suggestions for
the New CPS
Ensure that indicators
selected for CPS are
adjusted at CPS Progress
Report to correct for
discrepancies in the targets
and baselines noted in the
CPS results matrix versus
those in the project
documents.
Better specification,
(definition and
measurability) of indicators
achievable during the CPS
timeframe could also help
improve the quality of the
results matrix.
Including different
sectors under the same
outcome is not ideal, as the
overall moderate
performance of the energy
and water sector
overshadowed the
satisfactory achievements in
the road and fisheries
sectors.

28MW of wind energy installed. Actual: The
installed and functioning wind energy generation
capacity was 27MW at the end of 2012 from
about 3MW in 2008. This indicator was not
achieved during the CPS period. However, 27
MW is for the 4 wind farms developed by the
Cabeolica project company. In addition, there are
a few additional smaller windmills installed in
other Islands such as Santo Antao – when they
are taken into account, the installed capacity is
around 29MW.
Technical and non-technical losses decline from
30% toward less than 22-23% in 2012 (2010
benchmark: 24%). Actual: The technical and
non-technical losses stood at 27.8% in 2012.
This indicator was not achieved.
Percentage of road network with maintenance
increases from 35% to 50%. Actual: 44% of the
road network was covered by a performancebased maintenance contract that began in 2010
and expired in December 2012. This indicator
was substantially achieved but did not meet the
target value set in the CPS; therefore, it was
partially achieved.
Quality of the road network improved by
increasing the proportion of roads rated fair to
good condition by 10% (baseline: 45%; target:

the baseline and target values in the CPS and in
the project documents. As of November 2011,
the value of the indicator was 41%. The indicator
was not achieved by end of CPS period.
However, in mid-2013, the % was at 50
according to the Results Framework of the
Transport Sector Reform Project. This figure
continues to change as there are three ongoing
rehab contracts (Santo Antão, Fogo and São
Nicolau) and one more will be signed soon
(Maio). When these rehab works are completed
(before October 2014 for the first three), the %
will have reached more than 60%. At mid-2014,
this indicator is mostly achieved.

estimated at Escudos 500 million has been
established. This indicator was achieved.
Action plan to strengthen Transportes Aéreos de
Cabo Verde (Cabo Verde Airlines) (TACV)

action plan to strengthen TACV was adopted
during the CPS. Hence this indicator was not
achieved during the CPS period. However, in
January 2013, the consulting firm Global Energy
completed a very comprehensive diagnostic of
TACV, accompanied by a multi-year business
development strategy. In parallel, out of the

savings of the RSSP, the services of an
individual consultant were financed to prepare a
set of immediate, short-term emergency
measures. TACV is now working according to a
2-year recovery plan. Some of its measures have
already been implemented or are being
implemented, such as the cancellation of a wet
lease, reduced free travel perks to third parties,
cancellation of the most non-profitable routes,
fuel efficiency gains, use of lower cost airports,
higher intensity use of planes, spinning off of the
ground handling services). As result, TACV
have significantly reduced their operating losses
(-16 million US dollars in 2013 vs. -40 million in
2012)
Percentage of small-scale fishers supported to
undertake alternative livelihoods in
overexploited fisheries increases from base of
0% to a target of 10%. Actual: The project faced
some institutional delays during the first year but
is now on track. The value was 6% in 2012 (34
out of a total of 564 fishermen in the two comanagement pilot sites of Sal and Maio), This
falls short of the 10% envisioned at the CPS
design but is aligned with the West Africa
Regional Fisheries Program’s projections.
Within the next months, the number of fishermen
undertaking alternative livelihoods is expected to
increase. This indicator was partially achieved.

Value per unit of fishing effort in targeted
fisheries increased by 10% from base of
37kg/motorized vessel for artisanal fisheries, and
base of 170kg/motorized vessel for artisanal
small pelagic fisheries. Actual: This indicator is
on track in relation to the projections established
under the West Africa Regional Fisheries
Program 32 kg/trip/motorized vessel for
artisanal fisheries (2010 data). For artisanal small
pelagic fisheries it is 210 kg/trip/motorized

kg/trip/motorized vessel; for gillnet fisheries:
135 kg/trip/motorized vessel; for hand-line
fisheries: 75 kg/trip/motorized vessel (2010
data)). For artisanal fisheries, the catch rate has
decreased, but the use of newly established
fisheries management tools will improve rate of
return in the short to medium term. This
