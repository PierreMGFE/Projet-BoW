COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

i.
Since the last Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was discussed by the Board in M a y
1999, Lithuania has virtually completed i t s structural transformation t o a market economy,
established a track record o f prudent macroeconomic management and met a l l the requirements
for accession to the European U n i o n (EU), and joined the EU o n M a y 1, 2004. EU membership
will usher in a new stage in the relationship between the W o r l d Bank and Lithuania, with a
transition f r o m a borrower-lender relationship to a partnership featuring in particular analytic
w o r k and technical advice targeted at the key challenges Lithuania faces. This document, which
was prepared in consultation with Lithuania’s national and municipal governments,
representatives o f c i v i l society and other stakeholders, proposes a Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) for Lithuania for FY05-07, the first years o f EU membership. After the initial period o f
EU membership, Lithuania should be well o n i t s way in the transition to donor status although the
development challenges will be far from over. The CPS reflects the evolving relationship
between the W o r l d Bank and the Lithuanian authorities and other stakeholders. I t takes into
account the changing political, economic and social context o f the country, the remaining as w e l l
as new challenges, and the modalities for W o r l d Bank involvement best suited to address these
challenges.
ii.
The prospect o f EU accession has driven Lithuania’s reform and transition process. First,
i t has compelled the Government t o maintain sound monetary and fiscal policy. Second, adopting
the acquis communautaire has required legislative and institutional reforms and economic
restructuring. Third, the EU has provided needed technical and financial resources. Fourth, the
opportunity for membership in a globally competitive economic union has provided an incentive
for f i r m s to improve their performance and seek international partnerships.
iii.
Since the late-l99Os, Lithuania has enjoyed remarkable economic expansion. A domestic
banking crisis in 1995/6 and a financial crisis in Russia in 1998/9 destabilized the economy; but
Government measures to strengthen macroeconomic management, supported by IMF Stand-by
Arrangements in 2000 and 2001 and by Bank S A L S in 1996 and 2000, resulted in a rapid
recovery. In spite o f slow growth in the EU, already then Lithuania’s main trading and
investment partner, GDP growth recovered to 3.9 percent in 2000, reached over 6 percent in 200 1
and 2002, and accelerated to a remarkable 9 percent in 2003, making Lithuania the fastest
growing economy among the new EU member states. Unemployment fell f r o m 12.5 percent in
2001 to 9.4 percent by mid-2003. Fiscal consolidation continued, with the budget deficit
declining from 2.8 percent o f GDP in 2000 to 1.8 percent o f G D P in 2003. Inflation has remained
low, with the annual increase in the average CPI during 1999-2002 not exceeding 1.3 percent.
Investment has expanded vigorously after 2000, with annual increases in the range o f 10 to 20
percent. Both exports and imports have expanded at double-digit rates since 2000. Lithuania
successfidly completed the third and final review under i t s Precautionary Stand-by Arrangement
with the IMF in 2003 without making any purchases.
iv.
Despite Lithuania’s impressive recent growth, unemployment and poverty remain serious
problems, especially in rural areas. In 2001, 16.4 percent o f the population was below the
national poverty line. Poverty was more widespread and severe in rural areas, which accounted
for 70 percent o f the poor, but only about one-third o f the population. Rural areas have worse
health indicators, lower educational attainment and poorer access to public services. The level o f
unemployment, over 9 percent, i s s t i l l not acceptable. M u c h o f the unemployment seems t o be
structural, reflecting a mismatch o f skills and opportunities and insufficient geographic mobility.

Long-term joblessness i s a serious problem, affecting half the unemployed. An aging population
i s putting increasing pressure o n the social insurance system, which accounts for almost h a l f o f
public expenditure. High taxes o n employment to fund social insurance benefits hamper j o b
creation and contribute to unemployment.
Over the next few years, Lithuania’s development agenda will shift f r o m adoption o f the
acquis communautaire to i t s implementation and administration. The country’s overarching
challenges will be to sustain rapid economic growth and reduce poverty. Ensuring robust
economic growth will require maintaining sound monetary and fiscal policies, strengthening the
public sector and ensuring transparent governance, improving the climate for investment,
ensuring a business-friendly environment and facilitating the development o f a knowledge-based
economy, while addressing poverty and unemployment, building a competitive rural sector and
reducing regional disparities.
v.

vi.
EU accession will provide further opportunities f o r Lithuania’s economic progress if
macroeconomic policies remain prudent and structural reforms continue t o improve the
environment for investment, but accession to the EU will also create new challenges. EU
accession can provide additional stimulus in the form o f inflows o f grants f r o m the Structural and
Cohesion Funds, as w e l l as the Transition Facility. However, new challenges will arise as
Lithuania adjusts to the fiduciary standards and practices goveming the use o f these funds, as
w e l l as community policies and legislation in areas including, inter alia, environmental
protection, public procurement and elimination o f inequality. In addition, Lithuania must build i t s
capacity t o absorb and administer these funds and provide significant counterpart contributions.
Overall, Lithuania’s accession to the EU should contribute to further increases in investment,
trade and entrepreneurial activity as investors’ perceptions o f country risk are expected to
improve leading to higher growth and the hoped-for convergence with average EU incomes. But,
above all, EU membership i s o f institutional and political significance for Lithuania and the other
new member states.
In addition t o increased EU financial support, Lithuania w i l l have ample access to
financing f r o m the EIB, as well as private capital at competitive rates. Yet, given Lithuania’s s t i l l
relatively modest income level (Lithuania’s per capita income i s only about 40 percent o f the EU
15 countries), the constraints on i t s institutional capacity, and the remaining development agenda,
the proposed partnership with the W o r l d Bank i s appropriate. The Government primarily wishes
the W o r l d Bank to stay engaged as a key development partner for policy advice and knowledge
transfer, capacity building, implementation support and technical assistance, and effective use o f
EU structural funds and other grant resources. The Bank’s TA and E S W will be based o n
mutually agreed priorities and regularly monitored results. The Bank and the Government have
agreed o n the need for periodic reviews o f the program, initially semiannually, based o n a
common understanding o f the expected outcomes and their contribution to results o n the ground.

vii.

viii.
The authorities do not wish to preclude the possibility o f a limited financial role for the
W o r l d Bank building o n shared priorities and the ability o f the Bank to respond in a competitive,
timely and innovative manner. Lending options would remain open, within a ceiling o f US$300
m i l l i o n for FY05-07, linked o f course t o the relevant macro-economic and sector environment. In
particular, the authorities could avail themselves o f technical assistance lending under the
proposed EU8 Technical Assistance Facility Loan’. The Govemnient could also request W o r l d
Bank lending to meet co-financing needs for EU Structural and Cohesion Funds. The principal
change in the Lithuania - W o r l d Bank partnership will, therefore, involve a move to a
relationship with less emphasis o n lending, but continued analytic and advisory services that
reflect the priorities o f the country and the expertise o f the Bank.

- 111 ix.
Lithuania’s needs and interests and the W o r l d Bank’s strengths and experience mesh in
three thematic areas: building public sector capacity, sustaining growth and managing social
vulnerability. These would f o r m the pillars o f the proposed activities under the CPS.

Activities in building public sector capacity would focus on public expenditure
management, c i v i l service reform, measures to improve governance, strengthening
municipal govemments, regulatory reform and increased efficiency o f the social sector.
Activities contributing to strewtheninn the conditions for high, sustainable economic
growth would focus o n improvement o f business environment, development o f a
knowledge society, and rural development.
Activities t o help manage social vulnerability could involve further advice o n pension
reform, strengthening and targeting public assistance, improving the quality o f rural
education and improving the fiscal sustainability, efficiency and equity o f public health
expenditures.

x.
F o r i t s part, the Bank also stands t o benefit f r o m a strong partnership with Lithuania,
drawing o n i t s remarkable transition and growth experience o f recent years in addition to i t s
efforts to tackle remaining challenges t o enhance the Bank’s capacity to apply the relevant
lessons o f this experience more broadly.

MEMORANDUM OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTlVE DIRECTORS ON A
COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY
WITH THE REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA

I.

INTRODUCTION

1.
On M a y 11, 1999, the Executive Directors discussed the last Country Assistance Strategy
improved
(CAS) covering the period from mid 1999 through mid 2002. That C A S emphasized (i)
macroeconomic and financial stability, (ii)institution building and investments in health,
education and social assistance, and (iii)support for the reforms and investments needed for
accession to the European U n i o n (EU). On M a y 1, 2004, Lithuania became a member o f the EU
and assumed all the rights and obligations o f a member country. This Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) covering the first years o f EU membership, therefore, represents a new stage in
the cooperation between the Bank and Lithuania, with a transition f r o m a provider-client
relationship to a partnership featuring in particular analytic w o r k and technical advice targeted at
the key challenges Lithuania faces. I t was prepared in consultation with Lithuania’s national and
municipal governments, representatives o f c i v i l society and other stakeholders, and, to the extent
possible, reflects their comments.

COUNTRY CONTEXT

ECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS
A. RECEXT

2.
Lithuania has overcome profound structural problems and external shocks during its
transition to a market economy. At the time o f independence in 1990, production was almost
entirely state-owned and trade was oriented to the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance
(CMEA). A program o f phased price and market liberalization began shortly after independence
in 1991. Lithuania formally joined the W o r l d Bank and IMF in 1992. A Currency Board
Arrangement (CBA), which pegged the Litas t o the U S dollar, was adopted in 1994 t o establish
credibility for the newly established currency. Reforms accelerated in the second h a l f o f the
decade following Lithuania’s official application for EU membership in 1995 and the decision o f
the European U n i o n t o begin negotiations in 1999.
3.
Lithuania has been enjoying remarkable economic expansion with very l o w rates o f
inflation since the late-1990s. The prospect o f EU accession drove the reform and transition
process. First, it compelled the Government to maintain sound monetary and fiscal policy.
Second, adopting the acquis communautaive (the body o f common rights and obligations that
bind a l l the member states together within the EU) required legislative and institutional reforms
and economic restructuring. Third, the opportunity for membership in a globally competitive
economic union provided an incentive for f i r m s to improve their performance and seek
international partnerships. Fourth, EU’s technical and financial assistance helped as it leveraged
the support provided by the W o r l d Bank and the IMF.

4.
A domestic banking crisis in 199516 and a financial crisis in Russia in 1998/9
destabilized Lithuania’s economy; but Govemment measures to strengthen macroeconomic
management, supported by IMF Stand-by Arrangements in 2000 and 2001 and by W o r l d Bank
S A L S in 1996 and 2000, resulted in a rapid recovery. In spite o f slow growth in the EU, already
Lithuania’s main trading and investment partner, GDP growth recovered from negative 1.7
percent in 1999 to 3.9 percent in 2000, reached over 6 percent in 2001 and 2002, and accelerated
to a remarkable 9 percent in 2003, making i t the fastest growing economy among the n e w

-L-

member states o f the EU. Employment grew b y 4 percent in 2002 and the numbereof
unemployed dropped to 9.4 percent b y mid-2003 , with encouraging indicators throughout the
economy.

5.
Inflation remained at about 1 percent per year (measured by the CPI). Fiscal
consolidation continued, with the budget deficit declining from 2.8 percent o f GDP in 2000 to 1.8
percent o f GDP in 2003. Investment expanded vigorously after 2000, with annual increases in the
range o f 10 to 20 percent. Both exports and imports have expanded at double-digit rates since
2000. Lithuania successfully completed the third and final review under a Precautionary Stand-by
Arrangement with the IMF in 2003 without making any purchases.

6.
The transition from planned to market economy that started in the beginning o f 1990s i s
n o w virtually complete. Prices have been liberalized, transactions with foreign countries are
relatively liberal, and trade has been reoriented from the C M E A to the EU. The privatization
process i s nearly complete and almost all factors o f production are privately owned. Foreign
direct investment from the EU member states, in particular the Nordic countries, has also been
increasing.

EU accession will provide increased opportunities for Lithuania’s economic progress,
provided macroeconomic policies remain prudent and structural reforms continue to improve the
environment for investment. EU membership w i l l provide additional stimulus in the form o f
grants from the Structural and Cohesion Funds, as well as the Transition Facility. However,
Lithuania must build its capacity to absorb and administer these funds and restructure i t s public
expenditures to provide significant counterpart contributions. EU membership should also
contribute to further increases in investment, trade and entrepreneurial activity. Lithuania i s
already a relatively open country with average import duties below those in the EU. EU
membership has removed the remaining non-tariff barriers and duties on agricultural products. I t
will also contribute to growing sales o f Lithuanian companies’ products in the expanded EU and

-3increase competitive .pressures in the Lithuanian market. Above all, EU membership i s o f
institutional and political significance for Lithuania and the other n e w member states.

B. THE POLITICAL

SETTING

8.
Lithuania’s current Government i s i t s twelfth since the reestablishment o f independence
from the Soviet Union in 1990, but political commitment t o free market institutions and a
liberalized economy has remained strong. The current Government, a coalition o f the Lithuanian
Social Democratic Party and Social Liberal Party that took power in July 2003 has continued the
process o f privatization, adhered l o a sound monetary policy based o n the CBA, followed a
conservative fiscal policy and fulfilled all the preconditions for membership in the EU. On April
6, 2004, President Rolandas Paksas was impeached by the Seimas (Parliament) o n charges o f
corruption and misuse o f power and removed from office. Elections for a successor will be held
in June 2004 coincident with Lithuania’s first European Parliamentary elections. An
unprecedented event, the impeachment illustrated the checks and balances being exercised by
Lithuania’s democratic institutions which responded robustly, with the Parliament, the
Government under the leadership o f Prime Minister Brazauskas (himself a former President) and
the Constitutional Court a l l functioning in their appropriate roles.
9.
Lithuania’s accession to the EU enjoyed the support o f a l l major political parties.
Successive governments continued the programs aimed at preparing the country f o r EU
membership. Toward the end o f 2002, ten major political parties and key institutions o f c i v i l
society including the Confederation o f Industrialists, labor unions, universities, the Knowledge
Economy Forum, the Foreign Investor Forum, the Chamber o f Agriculture signed a National
Agreement o n priorities for economic and social development. The Agreement noted the need to
achieve rapid and sustainable economic growth and improve social welfare by increasing the
productivity and competitiveness o f the economy, creating employment and overcoming the
poverty and social divide. The Agreement focused o n long-term priorities including: ti) creating
strengthening the system
the conditions for Lithuania t o become a knowledge-based society; (ii)
overcoming poverty
of education and science to meet the challenges o f a knowledge society; (iii)
and the social divide; (iv) reforming the rural institutions to create a more competitive agriculture
and increase economic opportunities; and (v) reforming the public administration t o ensure
effective implementation o f EU accession priorities. Neither changes in Lithuania’s top
leadership nor the Seimas elections scheduled in October 2004, are likely to result in a significant
change in policy.
C. SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT
10.
Although Lithuania has been successful in the economic transformation process, not all
sectors have enjoyed the benefits o f this success thus far. The underlying imbalances and
structural problems in agriculture are the cause o f the l o w productivity level and l o w growth rate
o f agriculture, resulting in large pockets o f poverty, in particular in rural areas. Lithuania’s
education system needs modernizing t o increase i t s relevance t o the evolving demands o f the
labor market, and i t s health indicators are w e l l below the EU averages. While Lithuania’s social
protection system i s fairly extensive, it has some major gaps in coverage, and i t s efficiency needs
t o be improved.

Poverty and Unemployment
11.
According to UNDP Human Development Reports, the overall percentage o f the
Lithuanian population living below the relative poverty line decreased f r o m 18 percent in 1996 t o
16.4 percent in 2001. However. in rural areas, the percentage o f people living below the relative
poverty line increased f r o m 26 percent to 27.3 percent over the same period. Poverty i s more
prevalent in rural areas, and the depth and severity o f poverty are greater in rural areas.

-4According to a Lithuania Household Budget Survey (2000), rural areas accounted for about 70
percent o f the poor, while representing only about one-third o f the population. Moreover, rural
areas have worse health indicators (in 2001, infant mortality was 8.4 per 1,000 live births in rural
areas as compared to 7.4 in urban areas), lower educational attainment and poorer access t o other
public services.
With accelerating economic growth, unemployment fell from 12.5 percent in 2001 to
12.
11.3 percent in 2002 and to 9.4 percent by mid-2003. Yet, unemployment i s s t i l l too high. High
unemployment rates among the young in general, and the l o w employment levels for males ages
25-54 are serious concems. M u c h o f the unemployment seems to be structural, reflecting a
mismatch o f skills and opportunities and insufficient mobility. Long-term joblessness i s a serious
problem, affecting h a l f o f the unemployed.
13.
The rural poverty problem will be difficult t o overcome. Agriculture lags behind other
sectors in terms o f performance and productivity, which translates into l o w incomes, high
unemployment and widespread rural poverty. T o some extent, this reflects the structure o f the
farming sector with relatively small farm sizes; about 60 percent o f farms are 5 hectares or less.
In addition, almost a quarter o f the rural population i s age 60 or over. Finally, until recently, the
sector was plagued by policy distortions that hampered the modemization o f the rural economy.
Education and Health

14.
Lithuania has essentially achieved the M i l l e n i u m Development Goal o f universal
education with a net primary enrollment o f 95.7 percent in 2001, up f r o m 91.1 percent in 1996.
Enrollment in higher education also increased at a rate o f 12 percent per year, and the number o f
students graduating from secondary school increased by 7.5 percent per year over 1995-2001.
Adult education levels are high; a third o f the labor force has more than secondary education
However, there are some efficacy and efficiency issues in service provision. For example, with
the school age population shrinking, the student teacher ratio i s about 11:1, w e l l below the O E C D
average o f about 17: 1. Although the education level o f the Lithuanian labor force i s relatively
high, professional qualifications and the knowledge base of at least a part o f the labor force do
not meet changing labor market conditions. The health status of Lithuania’s population i s below
that o f EU countries; infant mortality i s substantially higher and life expectancy lower (related t o
tobacco and alcohol use). There i s an overemphasis o n tertiary health care, as opposed to primary
health care; and rural areas are under-served.
The Social Insurance System

15.
The social insurance system consists o f a state insurance program and a social assistance
program. The state insurance program includes pensions, unemployment benefits and health
insurance. The social assistance program provides cash transfers and social services both income
based (means tested benefits for l o w income families) and non-income based benefits (family
benefits and social pensions).
16.
Social insurance expenditures reached 16.7 percent of GDP in 2000 and accounted for
almost h a l f o f public expenditures reflecting the demands o n the pension system o f an aging
population. The percentage o f population age 60 years and over increased f r o m 15.7 in 1989 to
19.8 in 2001: more than 2 0 percent o f the population was receiving pensions in 2001. The
pension fund i s financed by a 31 percent contribution by the employer and a 3 percent
contribution by the worker. High social insurance taxes hamper j o b creation and contribute t o
unemployment.
17.
M o s t Lithuanian social assistance programs are categorical rather than means tested. This
results in gaps in the coverage and inadequate targeting to the most vulnerable groups.

-5Moreover, social insurance for the rural population i s inadequate, as most farmers are self
employed.
111.

LITHUANIA’S DEVELOPMENT AGENDA

18.
Lithuania’s development agenda is extensive, having been shaped and refined by a
number o f initiatives including the EU’s Lisbon Agenda, the requirements imposed by the acquis
communautaire, the National Accord o f 2002 and the Single Programming Document (SPD)
prepared for the European Commission (EC). The agenda reflects the need to find a balance
between the conditions for the growth o f productivity and competitiveness, while ensuring that
the vulnerable groups o f society benefit from economic growth and EU membership. As stated
in the 2002 CEM, policies need t o encourage modernization and restructuring throughout
the economy, n o t o n l y at the enterprise level but also among market-supporting institutions
and in the p u b l i c administration, w h i l e at the same time ensuring that the benefits o f EU
membership are spread broadly across the society. This may require dampening, w h e n
necessary, the potentially negative impact o f membership in some l e s s competitive sectors
and among vulnerable groups. Balancing these challenges requires continued strong
movement forward in implementing k e y structural reforms and modernizing governance t o
achieve sustained growth in productivity and competitiveness, w h i l e simultaneously
strengthening the social safety net.
19.
Maintaining a sound macroeconomic framework. Stable monetary and fiscal policies
have contributed significantly to Lithuania’s rapid economic growth. They remain important
because o f the expenditure requirements that accompany membership in the EU, and the
Government’s intention to j o i n the European Monetary U n i o n as soon as possible taking into
account the impact o n the economy and possible political and social consequences.
20.
Strengthening the financial system. Although the financial system has become
increasingly stable and credible, further efforts are needed t o deepen financial intermediation and
widen the range o f available financial products and services. Specifically, efforts should be made
t o increase banks’ lending to the private sector, enhance capital market access (to both equity and
debt instruments) for Lithuanian entities either domestically or in the wider EU capital market,
and develop the venture capital industry as a source o f risk capital and financing for innovation.
Additionally, given the demanding requirements o f the ucquis communautaire in the financial
sector area, it will be necessary t o continue, and in selected areas intensify, efforts t o strengthen
financial sector oversight and corporate governance and accounting and auditing standards and
practices, as w e l l as the supporting institutional infrastructure in these areas.

2 1.
Improving the climate for investment. In i t s quest for continued growth in productivity
and competitiveness, the Govemment must continue efforts to reduce the administrative barriers
t o market entry, and simplify and expedite business transactions and market exit. According to
the Global Competitiveness Report 2002/2003 recently issued by the W o r l d Economic Forum,
Lithuania’s ability to compete internationally ranked 49th among 75 countries - w e l l ahead o f the
Russian Federation and Ukraine for example - but among the less competitive countries joining
the EU. In terms o f likely future competitiveness, Lithuania ranks 43rd, suggesting that current
policies could slightly improve matters. Still, these rankings suggest that considerable
improvements are needed to sustain Lithuania’s income convergence with current EU members.
Investment in SMEs poses a special challenge. Since 99.4 percent o f enterprises had less than 250
employees while 95.6 per cent had less than 50 eniployees in December 2000, development o f SMEs
i s key to increasing competitiveness and reducing regional imbalances. The underdeveloped nature
o f the financial system resulting in lack o f access t o finance, high personal income and social
security taxes, and bureaucratic red tape in taxation and regulations, appear to be among the main
obstacles to SME development. Recent changes in the corporate profit tax, lowering the tax rate and

-6broadening the tax base, and the simplification o f rules w-ith respect to enterprise registration, should
improve the business environment for SMEs. However, these measures need t o be fully
implemented, and further legal and administrative barriers to S M E development need to be identified
and tackled.

22.
Strengthening the public sector and ensuring transparency. The regulatory functions
o f the Govemment have been expanding in order to implement EU regulatory norms. The reform
o f the public administration i s o n track, notably in terms o f increased stability and professionalism
o f the civil service but continued attention i s needed to strengthen the capabilities o f the adrmnistration
at the local level. The Department o f Public Administration o f the Ministry o f the Interior became
operational in December 2002. I t i s responsible for formulating policy proposals, drafting
legislation, approving training programs and managing the register o f c i v i l servants. This should
help ensure that the civil service reform i s properly implemented and that further developments o f
the public administration system take place in a structured way. Most ministries are s t i l l understaffed
and are likely to face challenges when implementing the acquis communautaive and managing
Structural Funds. This i s primarily due to lack o f funds, but also sometimes t o the fact that
strategic management i s s t i l l at an early stage. Although inter-ministerial cooperation has
improved, the situation i s s t i l l not satisfactory. Transparency in Government based o n the
principles o f accountability, impartiality and efficiency i s important for the appropriate use o f
public sector resources, for efficient use o f resources in the private sector and for t r u s t in
democratic institutions and governance.
23.
Developing a knowledge economy. The development o f an information society i s one
the Government’s highest priorities. This w i l l require facilitating cooperation between business,
research centers and universities, to strengthen incentives for innovation, in particular in SMEs,
and to encourage the spreading o f information technologies. Some progress has been made: use
o f PCs in schools increased by 60 percent in 2002, use o f e-government services i s rising,
growing number of households are using PCs and the internet and the market for I T products i s
growing. However, access t o telecommunications and the internet in rural areas i s low.
Box 1: Progress Toward Building a Knowledge Economy
Lithuania’s science and technology sectors are making a successful transition t o a modern market economy.
The National Accord o f 2002 aims t o boost the technology sector’s output f r o m 7 percent o f G D P in 2002 t o 25
percent in 2015. Lithuania i s already the leader among the Baltic States in biotechnology and laser technology. I T i s
one o f the country’s growing sectors, expanding at a 3 0 percent per year rate. Lithuania has a well-established culture
o f valuing knowledge and its science and technology sectors are making the transition t o a modern market economy.
In recent years, the Government has made progress in encouragmg the development o f a knowledge-based economy
by improving the economic and institutional regime and developing infrastructure for information and
coinmunications technology. The challenge for Lithuania i s t o develop n e w engines o f growth and t o &versify
economic activities. The keys t o improving competitiveness are the systematic generation, use, and communication o f
knowledge throughout the economy and society. The ability t o network w i t h i n and outside Lithuania, supported by
Internet access, w i l l become increasingly important t o accessing and using knowledge.
Access by citizens t o communications networks i s central t o the development o f the information society and the
knowledge economy. Yet access t o telecommunications and t o the internet in rural areas i s limited by lack o f ability
t o pay and lack of infrastructure. Extending access should be given hgh priority. The Government should act t o
provide a greater range o f services t o customers on a shared basis. An efficient market based solution w o u l d be t o
h o l d competitive tenders for subsidies t o provide a pre-determined level o f service.
The new member states agreed t o implement a common “e-Europe + Action Plan” and are developing national
strategies t o address k e y areas o f the knowledge economy t o accelerate reform and modernization o f their economies.
These include the development of a cheaper, faster more secure internet and accelerated provision of affordable
communications services for all, faster internet services for researchers and students, investing in people and skills,
and participation for a l l in the h o u r l e d g e economy.

Developing the knowledge economy with all its dimensions - eEurope, egovernment, ecommerce, enhanced research
and development, innovation and education - could b e a focus o f future Bank activity in the n e w member states,
including Lithuania.

-724.
Building a competitive rural sector. The agricultural sector faces difficult economic and
social challenges. Primary production i s generally characterized by small-scale semi-subsistence
farms with low productivity, potential financial problems due t o the modernization requirements
t o meet EU norms and l o w capacity to absorb EU financial support. The challenge i s to create
incentives f o r farmers to modernize and become more productive and encourage expansion o f
non-farm activities in rural areas.
Box 2: Implications for Lithuania of Reform of EU Agricultural Policy
Lithuania’s agricultural sector has experienced a marked structural transformation from a Soviet-style system to
a sector dominated by small privately owned farms. In the process, there was a steep drop in agricultural output.
Production in 2002 was only 75 percent o f the 1990 level. Agriculture’s contribution to GDP f e l l from
approximately 30 percent in 1990 to 7.9 percent in 2000. The share o f employees in agriculture fell from 22.9
percent in 1995 to 16 percent in 2001 (including industries and services related to agriculture). The agricultural
sector i s continuing to evolve. In 1998, there were more than 557,000 s m a l l farms with an average size o f 6.2
hectares. By January 2002, there were about 477,000 f a r m with an average size o f about 7 hectares.
Recent reforms o f the E U Coinmon Agricultural Policy (CAP) w i l l result in a second period o f adjustment and
transformation for Lithuanian agriculture. The reform involves a shift from production-linked payments to
payments to farmers irrespective o f production. This would reduce the link between farm subsidies and
production and give farmers greater flexibility to choose what they produce. The E U will gradually phase in the
direct payments starting at 25 percent o f the E U level in 2004 rising to 65 percent by 2006. Member states have
the option o f topping up payments out o f their own resources. Because new member states cannot calculate
payments entitlements for the same historical period 2000-2002 as used by the EU15, the per hectare payment
would be calculated by dividing the regional allocation by the regional utilized agricultural area. In general, the
system o f price support and quotas would reinain in place, but price cuts have been agreed to improve
international competitiveness. These include a 15 percent cut for cereals, butter and skimmed milk, and a 30
percent price cut for beef and veal. Farmers in the new member states w i l l be eligible for support ffom the EU,
which will provide a special package o f assistance o f up to Euro 5.8 billion over three years for early retirement
o f farmers, less favored areas, environmental protection, subsistence farms, and compliance with EU food
hygiene and animal welfare standards.

25.
Addressing social issues, and reducing unemployment, poverty and regional
disparities. The recent acceleration o f economic growth and resulting decline in unemployment
has mitigated some social pressures. However the further reduction o f unemployment and
poverty depends o n increased entrepreneurial activity, and continued economic development and
growth. This in turn requires better incentives for risk taking and innovation. N e w employment
and business growth i s a direct solution to most social problems and a source o f resources for
addressing others with public sector involvement. Incomplete reforms in health, education and
social assistance limit access t o social services f o r the wider population. The benefits o f
economic development are s t i l l mostly concentrated in the m a i n cities, while a large share o f the
rural population, consisting mostly o f small semi-subsistence farmers, many o f them at or close t o
the retirement age, continues to depend o n state support and barter activities.
26.
Lithuania’s gender indicators compare w e l l with other countries with similar GDP.
Lithuania has taken several legislative and institutional measures t o promote gender equality,
although implementation o f laws to address gender disparities has been slow. Govemment and
Parliamentary actions include: adopting an Action Plan for the Advancement o f Women in
Lithuania, passing a L a w o n Equal Opportunities f o r Women and Men, and establishing a
permanent Inter-Ministerial Commission f o r Equal Opportunities for Women and Men, as w e l l as
an Office o f the Equal Opportunities Ombudsman.
27.
Pension reform has advanced with the adoption o f legislation by the Parliament, but the
current plans fail to address the problem o f an impending social security deficit. The l a w o n
pension reform o f 2002 established a voluntary, defined contribution “second pillar” different
from the Government’s original plan for a system with compulsory participation for younger age
groups. The contribution rate was set at 2.5 percent o f earnings, increasing to 5.5 percent by

-82007. B o t h decisions, to opt for voluntary second pillar participation and to set a rather l o w
contribution rate for the second pillar, are problematic and could significantly delay any meaningfd
reform. Such a reform should entail compulsory participation o f younger-age cohorts, and a gradual
adjustment o f contribution rates to the second pillar to ensure a stable and acceptable pension level
for retirees.
IV.

MEDIUM TERM PROSPECTS AND CHALLENGES

Accession to the EU represents the completion o f political and economic reforms and
structural transformation policies during the past dozen or so years. Economic reforms combined
with increasing integration with and support from the EU and other international financial
institutions have resulted in continuing accelerated economic growth and development. The
additional challenges for Lithuania are t o reduce unemployment and poverty, improve health,
education and public services, in particular, in rural areas, establish clear priorities to diversify
economic activities and develop new engines o f growth.

28.

29.
The base case scenario o f this CPS envisions continued economic growth o f about 6
percent per annum, exceeding EU averages, combined with continued l o w inflation, a moderate
current account deficit and declining external debt. The likelihood o f this scenario i s supported by
the forecasts o f other IFIs and the Government. A l o w case scenario i s unlikely, given EU
accession, relatively easy access to external capital and the Government’s commitment to
fulfilling the requirements o f EU membership. EU membership means final removal o f the last
barriers to the free movement o f goods, services, labor and capital between the EU and the new
member states. It will offer further opportunities to exploit existing trade and investment
potential and to take advantage o f other forms o f economic cooperation.

30.
Nevertheless, membership in the EU will create new challenges. In particular, it will
require an increase in expenditures related to the implementation o f the EU membership
obligations. These can be financed only by sustaining rapid economic growth similar or close t o
recent experience and rationalizing existing expenditure programs.
3 1.

The competitiveness o f Lithuanian companies i s also critical t o sustaining economic
growth. The Government acknowledges the importance o f improving conditions for enhanced
competitiveness. However, administrative barriers to creating new enterprises, hiring and firing
workers, tax administration and other regulatory barriers are s t i l l significant impediments t o
overall competitiveness. Competitive pressures will increase as Lithuania faces increased
competition in the single market. F o r example, one-third o f Lithuanian exports t o the EU
comprise textiles and apparel w h i c h will b e significantly impacted by the phase out o f the
Multifiber Agreement in 2005 and the resulting increase in access o f l o w priced textiles f r o m
developing countries to the EU market. Competing in the market for unskilled labor-intensive
goods will be increasingly difficult as wage levels in Lithuania rise with economic growth.

V.

THE LITHUANIA -WORLD BANK PARTNERSHIP FY05-07

A. PREVIOUS ASSISTANCE
AND COUNTRY ASSISTANCEEVALUATION
32.
The Bank has been the largest single lender t o Lithuania, with commitments totaling
US$490.8 million (US$402.6 m i l l i o n net o f cancellation) for 17 operations since 1992, including
t w o Structural Adjustment Loans. Five projects with Bank loans totaling about US$105.7
m i l l i o n are under implementation. The Bank has also been carrying out economic and sector

w o r k and providing technical assistance t o Lithuania since independence. In response to strong
demand f r o m the authorities f o r a robust analytical base t o inform the design o f policies and
programs to develop a knowledge-based economy and help Lithuania progress towards the
competitiveness goals o f the Lisbon Agenda, the Bank prepared an innovative Knowledge

-9Economy Assessment - the first in the region. A summary o f recent E S W undertaken by the
Bank i s provided in Annex B4.

Box 3: Country Assistance Evaluation
E D ’ SCountry Assistance Evaluation (CAE R2003-0063, April 21, 2003) noted that the Bank’s strategies were
highly relevant to Lithuania’s needs, the efficacy o f assistance was high, and efficiency substantial, the
institutional development impact was high in key areas, less so in health and agriculture, and sustainability was
judged to be likely. The CAE also stated that the Bank had made a concerted effort to forge partnerships as
substantiated by client surveys. The CAE noted that the priority the Bank attached initially to stabilizing the
economy and restoring growth while supporting the economy’s transformation was appropriate as were the
emphases on energy, social protection, and infrastructure. The CAE further noted that the expanded scope o f
the strategy in the FY99 CAS was also appropriate, in particular, the attention to social issues not covered b y the
E U accession agenda while also supporting the E U accession agenda explicitly. According to the CAE, the
Bank’s assessment o f the risks faced by Lithuania was good and the provisions in the strategies to respond to the
risks were appropriate
The CAE concluded that the quality o f the Bank’s diagnostic work was good and there were generally strong
links between the analytical work and the design o f the lending program The CAE’s positive evaluation o f
Bank group analytical and advisory activities included the FY03 CEM which was found to have a good analysis
o f remaining EU accession issues, with specific recommendations to complete the transition to E U membership
and a thorough treatment o f poverty and labor market issues, although the CAE noted that the analysis o f
pension issues was not fully satisfactory. A FIAS study on Administrative Barriers (1999), was noted as having
provided useful analytical input to Bank adjustment lending. A 2002 update found that administrative barriers
still imposed a substantial burden, especially on SMEs. A joint BanMIMF Financial Sector Assessment
Program (FSAP) provided a favorable assessment o f the state o f structural and legal reforms in the financial
sector in the run-up to E U accession. The FSAP also indicated that Lithuania’s financial system was
significantly smallerAess developediless diversified than in other new member states and therefore posed a
significant developmental challenge going forward.
The CAE also rated Bank lending activities in Lithuania as satisfactory. The seven projects evaluated by OED
had a 95 percent satisfactory outcome (weighted by cormnitments). Outcomes, sustainability and institutional
development were all rated above the ECA region’s and Bankwide averages. The CAE recommended, among
the other things, that as an essential component o f the strategy to reduce poverty, the Bank should endeavor to
support agricultural sector adjustment, help address unemployment, support initiatives to reduce labor market
constraints, help improve the business environment and upgrade huinan capital. The CAE also suggested that
more attention could have been paid to sequencing and prioritizing; and that the Bank should focus early on
helping develop a public consensus for contentious issues. These recommendations were taken into
consideration in formulating the proposed partnership strategy, taking into account the need for selectivity and
the limited range of instruments under consideration by the Government.

B. WORLDBANKSTRATEGY

33.
Since the last CAS, Lithuania has virtually completed i t s structural transformation t o a
market economy, established a track record o f prudent macroeconomic management, met a l l the
requirements for accession to the EU, and joined the EU o n M a y 1, 2004. The proposed strategy
for Lithuania focuses o n the first years o f EU membership, coincident with the current period o f
the EU budgeting framework through 2006. EU membership will usher in a new stage in the
relationship between the W o r l d Bank and Lithuania with a transition f r o m a borrower-lender
relationship to a partnership featuring, in particular, analytic w o r k and technical advice targeted at
the key challenges Lithuania faces. EU membership will provide further opportunities for
Lithuania’s economic progress assuming macroeconomic policies remain prudent and structural
reforms continue to improve the environment for investment, but EU membership will also
present new challenges. EU membership will mean increased EU financial support, access to EIB
and EBRD financing, as well as to the Eurobond market.
34.

Yet, given Lithuania’s s t i l l relatively modest income level (its per capita income i s only
about 40 percent o f the EU 15 countries), the constraints o n i t s institutional capacity, and the

- 10remaining development agenda, the proposed partnership with the Bank i s appropriate.
Furthermore, at US$3,750 in 2002, Lithuania’s per-capita income (GNI) i s also w e l l below the
average for new member states (US$4,820) and below the Bank graduation threshold (US$5,115
in 2002 dollars). T h i s implies that the country must meet the challenges o f increasing business
competitiveness and building capacity in public administration with fewer resources, less room
for maneuver, less tolerance for delays in necessary structural reforms, and relatively greater
vulnerability t o shocks than several other wealthier, though slower growing, new member states.
The macroeconomic scenario o n which the Lithuania-World Bank partnership i s predicated
assumes continued economic growth exceeding the average for EU countries, l o w inflation,
continuing substantial FDI flows, the current account deficit averaging about 5.4 percent o f G D P
through 2007, and the Government’s fiscal deficit declining to 1.1 percent o f G D P by 2007.

35.
The Bank will maintain a dialogue with the Government, exchanging views o n the types
and forms o f assistance that would be useful as the country’s circumstances evolve. While
currently foreseeing a shift in the partnership with the Bank to greater if not exclusive reliance on
Bank AAA, the authorities do not wish t o preclude the possibility o f a limited financial role f o r
the Bank building o n shared priorities and the ability o f the Bank t o respond in a competitive,
timely and innovative manner. AAA, possible cofinancing or other funding could be employed in
overcoming some o f the institutional constraints to carrying out the reforms and institutional
strengthening required t o hlfill the commitments o f EU membership and use EU resources
efficiently. In order t o increase i t s potential usefulness t o the new EU member states, including
Lithuania, the Bank i s considering a multi-country technical assistance facility, which w o u l d be
available o n demand to the new EU members and sectonvide approaches to lending to support
policy reforms and investment. EU compliant fiduciary, procurement and disbursement
procedures for the relevant implementing agencies w o u l d be accredited, minimizing the
perceived non-financial costs o f Bank loans, and ensuring that the Bank’s fiduciary and safeguard
standards are not diluted. Should Lithuania determine that i t would like to avail itself o f these
options, the framework could accommodate lending o f US$300 m i l l i o n during the period o f this
partnership. Bank support t o the implementation o f the five on-going projects would continue,
limiting the availability o f administrative budget funds for other uses. Within these constraints,
the Bank would continue to provide AAA f r o m i t s o w n resources for mutually agreed priorities.
AAA w o u l d be based o n mutually agreed priorities and regularly monitored results with periodic
(semi-annual) reviews.
36.
The World Bank’s Comparative Advantage. The Bank’s role as a development partner
i s valued by the Government and implementing agencies given that the authorities want the Bank
to stay engaged as a key development partner for policy advice and knowledge transfer, capacity
building, implementation support and technical assistance, and effective use o f EU structural
funds and other grant resources. Building o n the partnership developed during the 1990s and the
experience gained as Lithuania pursued i t s reform program, the Bank i s well-placed to continue
i t s partnership with Lithuania during the initial years o f EU membership. The Bank i s perceived
as an independent third party providing objective analysis and advice, and adding value by
sharing global best practice. Through planned cross country analytical w o r k o n development
issues w h i c h are common to the new- member states, such as public finance management, the
Bank can help promote debate and discussion among the various stakeholders jn Lithuania as
w e l l as the other n e w member states, and help identify solutions which may be common across
the countries and may lend themselves to implementation o n a regional basis.

3 7.
Public Consultations. Lithuania i s participating in the Bank-wide Information
Disclosure Pilot whereby interim CPS documents were shared with stakeholders at relevant
stages o f the CPS preparation. Under the Pilot, t w o workshops were held in January 2003 t o
inform regional and national media o f the CPS process with the participants representing
academia, NGOs, the Government, the B a n k and media. Additional consultations held in

- 11 February and M a r c h 2003, confirnied the approach and proposed areas o f engagement. A series
of questions added to the National Omnibus Survey and five focused consultations with
stakeholders provided valuable feedback o n public perceptions o f the W o r l d Bank in Lithuania
(Annex B11).

C. THE PARTNERSHIP

PROGRAM
FY05-07

38.
Lithuania’s needs and interests and the World Bank’s strengths and capacities mesh in
three thematic areas: building public sector capacity, sustaining growth, and managing social
vulnerability. While the Partnership currently focuses o n AAA, lending options remain open as
indicated above. Given Lithuania’s l o w Bank exposure, Bank lending in the neighborhood o f 10
percent o f total borrowing o f approximately Euro 2.8 billion, (at current exchange rates,
approximately US$3.4 billion) over the 2005-07 period, could be accommodated in this
Partnership framework.
Building public sector capacity. The Bank will provide support in the areas o f public
39.
expenditure management, c i v i l service reform, municipal finance and capacity building, and the
efficiency o f social sector programs in health, education and social protection. The goals o f our
collaboration would be to bring about more efficient use o f budgetary resources, help to balance
budgetary commitments and receipts, strengthen the capacity o f public sector employees and
increase the quality o f public services, and reduce incentives for corruption.
Sustaining growth. Achieving sustainable growth i s both a result o f appropriate
40.
economic policies allowing for increased competitiveness and business development, and a
requirement for addressing social issues. In suggesting pnority areas for a W o r l d Bank
partnership with Lithuania, the Bank recognizes the need to strike a balance between the
enhancement o f incentives for further growth o f competitiveness, entrepreneurship and business
development, and the reduction o f social vulnerabilities. This suggests a focus on: improving the
business environment, developing the knowledge economy, and developing the rural economy.
Assistance in the area o f business environment could include the development o f measures t o
improve the conditions for entrepreneurship, business start-ups and the expansion o f existing
enterprises. The Bank could provide assistance for measures to encourage the development o f a
knowledge economy including increasing expertise, fostering cooperation between research and
business communities and strengthening the capacity o f the education system to deliver l i f e long
learning. The Bank can help design measures to improve conditions for business development
and expand availability and use o f knowledge and information technologies. Trade facilitation,
leading to more efficient utilization o f infrastructure can also contribute to greater competitiveness.

41.
Reducing social vulnerability. The Bank’s focus w o u l d be o n helping t o ensure both
equity and sustainability in social protection and the delivery o f social services. If the authorities
are prepared to revisit pension reform to take the necessary steps for medium t o long term
sustainability, the Bank could assist in the application o f regional and global best practice. Health
care i s another area that requires a long-term perspective. The Bank’s emphasis would be o n
assisting the Government t o implement a refomi agenda including: (i)identifying and
implementing necessary changes in the health facilities infrastructure; (ii)improving fiscal
sustainability, efficiency and equity o f public health expenditures, concentrating o n health
creating
financing and insurance, and reimbursement arrangements for prescription drugs; (iii)
public-private partnerships and exploring other options to improve quality and access to services;
and (iv) strengthening public health services. While the main focus o f potential Bank engagement
in the education system relates to enhancing i t s impact o n competitiveness, emphasis o n
improving the quality o f rural schools would help reduce the economic and social disadvantages
confronting families in rural areas.

- 1242.
Framework for World Bank Support to N e w Member States of the EU. If the
Government wishes, Lithuania could use instruments under the proposed common operational
framework for E U 8 countries - the E U 8 Technical Assistance Loan Facility to assist with
institution and capacity building and the E U 8 Sector Wide Approach to pool Bank financial
support with Government funds related to priority programs or sectors. This approach could
support policy reforms as w e l l as continuation o f existing good policies and investment programs,
and could be used to cofinance a n d o r pre-finance EU Structural and Cohesion Funds.
VI.

COMPLEMENTARITY WITH EU AND OTHER PARTNERS

43.
IF1 support to Lithuania as it progressed toward EU membership has been closely
coordinated with the EC under a Memorandum o f Understanding (MoU) signed in response t o
the EC’s Agenda 2000 which called upon IFIs to assist in the enlargement process. The
signatories to the M o U include the EC in liaison with EIB, the W o r l d Bank, the EBRD, IFC, the
Nordic Investment Bank (NIB), the Nordic Environment Finance Corporation, the Council for
Europe Development Bank, and the Black Sea Trade and Development Bank. Regular meetings
o f the parties t o the MoU help ensure the complementarity o f the respective assistance programs,
smooth implementation and enhanced effectiveness o f their cooperation.
44.
Lithuania has benefited f r o m substantial pre-accession assistance f r o m the EU: the
PHARE program, t o help implement the ucquis communuutaire, strengthen administrative
capacity and help prepare projects; SAPARD, for agricultural and rural development; and I S P A
for infrastructure projects. PHARE commitments t o Lithuania totaled Euro 591.7 m i l l i o n during
the 1992-2003 period. Of the Euro 30.4 million annual S A P A R D allocations since 2000, Euro
116.8 m i l l i o n has been committed and Euro 45.8 m i l l i o n disbursed. Lithuania’s ISPA allocations
total Euro 53 m i l l i o n +/- 20% annually depending on the quality and balance o f projects
submitted. Of this, Euro 60.8 m i l l i o n has been disbursed. The remaining committed P H A R E
funds will continue support for SMEs and business related infrastructure. PHARE assistance i s
being replaced with a Transition Facility to help build capacity. Lithuania’s allocation i s Euro
27.3 m i l l i o n over the 2004-2006 period.

EU Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund will be the m a i n sources o f EU financing for
45.
Lithuania providing up to Euro 930 m i l l i o n and Euro 608 m i l l i o n respectively during 2004-06.
Decommissioning o f the Ignalina nuclear power plant will be financed through a separate
dedicated fund o f up to Euro 165 million. Eligibility for use o f these funds i s based on the SPD
w h i c h contains the Government’s strategy and priorities for action. The SPD describes the socioeconomic context, defines and justifies the strategy, priorities and objectives, and outlines the
system for the monitoring, evaluation, financial management and control o f the programs.
Accessing these funds w i l l require budgetary realignment t o accommodate co-financing
requirements, in addition t o pre-financing and other upfront expenditures related t o EU
membership.

Box 4: EU Financial Support for the New Member States
Recognizing that in some cases the new members require additional support to strengthen administrative
capacity to implement and enforce E U legislation and to foster exchange o f best practices among peers, a Euro
426 million Transition Facility has been established for the new member states until the end o f 2006. I t i s
intended to help strengthen administrative capacity to implement EC legislation and has no overlap with the
areas covered by the Structural Funds. In addition, like all other E U member countries, the EU8 w i l l have
access to four EU Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund.

EU Structural Funds totaling Euro 14.1 billion from mid-2004 through 2006 are summarized below:
0

0

0

0

the European Regional Development Fund aimed at promoting economic and social cohesion within the E U
by reducing imbalances between regions or social groups;
the European Social Fund designed to prevent and combat unemployment, as well as develop human
resources and promote integration into the labor market;
the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund to promote structural reforms in the agriculture
sector and to develop rural areas; and
the Financial Instruments for Fisheries Guidance to promote structural reforms in the fisheries sector.

E U Structural Funds are allocated as follows:

0

0

70 percent for regions whose development i s lagging behind (objective 1);
11.5 percent for economic and social conversion in areas experiencing structural difficulties (objective 2);
12.3 percent to modernize training systems and create employment outside the objective 1 regions where
such measures form part of the strategies for catching up (objective 2); and
5.35 percent for four “community initiatives” seeking common solutions to specific problems, such as
cross-border and inter-regional cooperation.

The EU Cohesion Fund totaling Euro 7.6 billion from mid-2004 through 2006 i s designed to finance projects to
improve the environment and develop transport infrastructure in EU8 countries with per capita GNP below 90
percent o f the E U average. In this way, the Cohesion Fund contributes to sustainable development o f concerned
EU regions as well as strengthening cohesion within the EU.

The EBRD will focus o n support o f SMEs and the development o f non-bank financial
institutions and restructuring, commercialization and private sector participation in infrastructure,
give special attention to S M E development outside the m a i n cities, and the agricultural sector.
Another key priority will be to enhance the business climate. I t will support restructuring,
commercialization, and participation by the private sector in infrastructure, through preprivatization finance and participation with strategic investors in privatization and postprivatization investments, and ensure that these entities comply with standards required f o r EU
accession. It will continue with i t s active role as administrator o f the Nuclear Safety Account and
the Ignalina International Decommissioning Support Fund.

46.

47.
The EIB has supported a series o f transport projects, such as rehabilitation o f railways and
roads, development o f port infrastructure and rehabilitatiodmodemization o f Vilnius airport. I t
has also financed telecommunications (mobile telephony), environmental projects, and small and
medium sized enterprises and small infrastructure in the countiy. In the future, EIB will support
operations focusing o n SMEs and the development o f non-bank financial intermediaries. I t w i l l
also seek to support larger industrial and service enterprises to facilitate foreign investment and
restructuring, commercialization, and participation by the private sector in infrastructure
investment.
48.
NIB i s continuing support for Lithuania for b o t h the public and private sectors, t o help
develop energy, transportation, housing, and health care services as well as municipal financing.
Lithuania became a member o f NIB in February, 2004. Lithuania i s also supported by the
Northern Dimension in the extemal and cross-border policies o f the EU, which i s aimed at

- 14developing the Baltic Sea region, the Arctic Sea region and North West Russia. and increasing
cooperation among existing and new EU member states and Russia in a number o f sectors,
including environment, nuclear safety, energy, infrastructure, judicial, and social development.
49.
UNDP will continue i t s support for the reduction o f social vulnerabilities in selected
areas. UNDP conducted a rural poverty assessment in 2002. Based on its findings, a program
aimed at reducing rural poverty, social inclusion, management, and community empowerment
might be prepared ifsufficient funds are mobilized. UNDP’s youth program i s focusing o n health
services and employment generation, municipal level. U N D P i s also looking at public health in
schools and overall health promotion.

50.
A Precautionary IMF Stand-by Arrangement was completed in M a r c h 2003 without any
purchases. The relationship between the IMF and Lithuania will, o f course, continue within the
framework o f Article I V consultations and technical assistance.
VII.

RISKS

5 1.

M o s t risks cluster around internal difficulties stemming from the structural rigidities in
adjusting to accession and external dependence o n Euro-zone trends. EU accession mitigates
sovereign risks in the medium-term, as reflected, for example, in the narrowing o f bond market
spreads.
52.
Intemal risks are related to the effects o f EU accession and inconiplete reforms. T w o
types o f intemal risks could become effective after accession. One i s insufficient competitiveness
and institutional capacity to cope fully with the challenges o f EU accession, because o f
incomplete reforms, lack o f new technologies, remaining barriers to business and shortage o f
skills. Another i s increasing demand for public expenditure leading to deterioration o f fiscal
balances. This could be caused by potentially large co-financing costs o f EU-related investments
f o r the use o f structural funds, particularly at the sub-national level, increased public spending
with weak prioritization and delays in implementing structural reforms in health and pensions,
Government commitments for land, property and savings restitution programs, and finally the
possible costs o f topping up payments to farmers. Populist political pressures could exacerbate
these expenditure demands. On balance the authorities’ track record in maintaining fiscal
discipline in recent years and the commitment t o early accession t o EMU are strong mitigating
factors.
53.
External risks involve potential adverse economic developments in major economic
partner countries. Possible external trade shocks and economic slowdown or stagnation in the
major trade partners may diminish export growth rates. M o r e specific external risks are related t o
the trade structure: the fact that the second largest export item o f Lithuania i s textiles and
clothing, which w i l l be subject to competition fi-oin l o w wage producers after the expiration o f
the Multifiber Agreement. Vulnerability to o i l price swings remains, which also affect income
from the transit trade. Finally, there i s a possibility o f extemal investment shock created by
adverse economic developments in major investment partners, in particular the Nordic countries.
However Lithuania’s vulnerability t o extemal risks has certainly diminished since the mid-1990s
and the maintenance o f high growth rates in recent years should help cushion a l l but the most
extreme (and therefore least likely) shocks.

CONCLUSION

54.
The Bank’s collaboration with Lithuania dates t o the early days o f i t s Independence,
through i t s successful transition from a centrally planned economy to a competitive, rapidly
growing market economy, able to take i t s place as member o f the EU. The Bank welcomes this
development and looks forward to forging a new partnership with the Govemment, providing
support consistent with the country’s evolving needs and the Bank’s established strengths and
capacities .

Republic o f Lithuania - Consultations o n the Country Partnership Strategy
In agreement with the Lithuanian Government, the World Bank’s Lithuania country team
undertook extensive consultations for the preparation o f this Country Partnership Strategy. The
consultations process included discussions with sector ministries, members o f the Seimas
(Parliament), civil society and private sector representatives, and members o f the international
community (embassies and multilateral organizations). Consultation meetings with NGOs, local
authorities and business representatives were held in Vilnius, as well as the regions o f Utena, Kaunas
and Klaipeda.

The CPS team shared the outline o f the CPS with the stakeholders early in the preparation
process. The CPS outline and the comments from various stakeholders were available on the World
Bank’s Lithuania Country Office website throughout the CPS development period.
The discussion revealed priorities, perceptions and thoughts o f Lithuania’s officials, civil
society organizations, think tanks, businesses and academia. There was general agreement among
stakeholders that the CPS i s focused, reflects the needs o f the country, builds on the World Bank’s
comparative strengths and addresses the issue o f complementarity well. There was wide appreciation
from civil society participants o f the participatory process, which was open to all interested parties.
Participants made a number o f informed comments with regard to World Bank assistance
priorities and instruments, procedures and fiduciary requirements, general policy issues and regional
involvement as well as the existing program. Many o f the comments shaped the final CPS. At the
same time, participants acknowledged the complex nature o f the Lithuania-World Bank co-operation
due to lack o f national consensus on economic strategy and reforms, often limited capacity for policy
analysis and implementation, and possible overlap with the activities o f other agencies in the public
and the private sectors.
In M a y 2003, as part o f the early consultations, the World Bank commissioned a General
Population Opinion Survey (OMNIBUS) to explore the views o f the general public on Lithuania’s
development priorities and probe into poverty issues. The survey also tested the general awareness
about the activities o f the World Bank and other intemational institutions in Lithuania. The public was
fairly aware o f the World Bank and had a generally favorable opinion o f i t s activities. The survey in
principle confirmed the appropriate choice o f CPS priorities. Most survey respondents believed that
the Government’s main priorities should be the improved well-being o f all citizens, job creation,
combating corruption, EU accession, assisting the most vulnerable, economic stability, private sector
development and expansion o f trade. While most respondents associated poverty with hunger and
homelessness, an equally large group, about 40 per cent, associated poverty with being unemployed,
followed by shortage o f access to services, l o w incomes, increasing alcoholism, drug abuse,
prostitution, disease, crime and violence.

Under the Lithuania Disclosure Pilot, to better disseminate the draft CPS and promote
informed coverage by the national and regional media, two well-attended media workshops for editors
and joumalists were organized in co-operation with the Lithuanian Journalism Center.

A thematic summary o f the comments received during the CPS consultation process i s
provided below.
Public Administration
Need for a broader review o f state functions with regard to privatization and EU accession.
0
Implementation i s one o f the most serious issues in Lithuanian public administration.
0
A system o f new legislation impact assessment (ex ante) as well as a system for monitoring
and evaluation o f decisions under implementation (e.x post-)needs to be developed.

Annex B11
Page 2 o f 3
0

The efficiency o f social protection depends heavily o n whether it i s channeled directly or
provided through economic regulation and support measures (agricultural prices regulation,
utility subsidies, etc.)
Pension reform - the World Bank has a role to play in increasing the credibility o f the pension
0
funds system.
0
Housing renovation needs to be promoted through gradual removal o f utility subsidies and

Healthcare
0

0

0

The Lithuanian healthcare system has insufficient incentives for establishment o f private

policy should not be impairing the quality o f healthcare.
Need for greater co-operation with civil society o n healthcare issues.
Need for greater attention to healthcare service delivery for marginalized groups.

Education
0
A study o f the operating environment for private and public educational institutions i s needed
(financing, etc.).
0
Curriculum review and development, as well as greater selectivity should lead to better core
competencies.
0
The spirit o f competition among schools needs to be encouraged.
0
