i

Poverty in India: a global challenge Poverty reduction is not only India's most
compelling challenge, but also a challenge of global significance According to World Bank
figures, India has some 470 million people living on less than US$1 a day, 36% of the total
number of poor in the world India also has some 20% of the world's out-of-school children
While most social indicators are improving in India, infant and maternal mortality remain high,
and there are new challenges too, including a resurgence of tuberculosis and the spread of
HIV/AIDS which, if unchecked, could become a major threat to India's future
ii
India's Poverty Reduction Strategy India's strategyfor poverty reduction, the
fundamentalelements of which are contained in the Ninth Five-Year Plan and its Mid-Term
Appraisal, sets the pursuit of growth with social justice and equity as its basic objective To
achieve this goal, the Plan's strategy is articulated along two main directions
*

First, it calls on the state to depart from its traditional role "of being a pervasive controller of
private sector activity, and also a direct producer through public sector enterprises" to one
aimed at "enabling [the] private sector to reach its full potential " To improve the enabling
environment, the strategy calls for greater public and private investment in infrastructure, the
restoration of fiscal balance, and continued liberalization,especially in agriculture, foreign
trade, and financial markets

*

Second, the Plan emphasizes that "what is involved is not so much a reduction in the role of
the state as a reorientation " Three "areas of special importance for state interventions" are
highlighted provision for all of basic minimum services, such as education and health,
generation of productive employment, and restoration of regional balance In both of the
latter two areas, the Plan acknowledgesthe primary importance of rural development and
public investment in agriculture

iii
In addition, the Plan reflects the increasing importance of the states in complementing the
role of the central government in the implementationof the poverty reduction strategy India's
Constitution grants considerable power to the states in terms of regulatory oversight, tax and
expenditure assignments, provision of infrastructure, and provision of social services Before the
1990s, states' discretion in policy making was limited by the dominance of national political
parties and central planning The changes in the 1990s have made the quality of a state's own
economic and social management a much more important determinant of its growth and social
performance The Ninth Plan explicitly recognizes the importance of state-level reform, and
envisages "healthy competition among the states for evolving efficient and socially desirable
policies "
iv
Bank Group Strategy The Group's strategy builds not only on the Government's poverty
reduction strategy, but also on the Bank's past programs and extensive analytical work
undertaken on poverty in India Comparison of the findings from this work and the government's
diagnosis and strategy reveals a high level of shared understanding with respect to both the
constraints to poverty reduction and the measures required to relax these constraints A recurring
theme of both Bank analytical work and Plan documents is the need to accelerate the pace of
reform The primary challenge for the Bank Group, therefore, is one of providing incentives for
reform, and assisting with implementation
v
*

Strategic Principles The strategy follows three core strategic principles
Selectivity is vital in a country as large and as full of potential as India As in the previous
CAS, Bank assistance will continue to be focussed on poorer states that are implementing

-

11 -

wide-ranging reform programs This allows for a CDF approach to be taken to promote
growth and accelerate poverty reduction, based on a deeper understanding of the state' s
specific social, political and economic position as well as a wide-ranging and high-level
partnership In other states, support will be provided to those sectors implementing reforms
while in the poorest but non-reforming states, policy dialogue and capacity building will be
more effective interventions than lending
*

The Bank's state focus is balanced by a strong but selective program of support to the central
government for national issues, involving both lending and non-lending services Four
important areas of focus at the central government level are agriculture and rural
development, fiscal and governancereform, financial sector development, and health sector
reforms There are important complementarities between state and central work Many issues
are being pursued at both levels, using a dual-track approach, from financial accountability,
to procurement, to private participation in infrastructure Moreover, the Bank's program in
any state is pursued with the approval and participation of the Government of India, the
comprehensive reform agenda the Bank supports in the focus states, for instance, is based on
that proposed by the Government of India for states to follow

*

Partnerships To use the Bank Group's limited resources in a catalytic manner, strong
partnerships are needed with our clients and other donors and stake-holders, based on a
shared vision and principles The Government of India is of course the Bank's principal
partner, but additional partnerships are pursued with its support IEFChas important
partnerships with a number of Indian financial institutions Partnerships at the state level are
particularly important, not only with the concerned state government, but also with other
donors - most of whom are now adopting a state focus Scaling up is another important
aspect of partnership the Bank can scale up smaller donor-backed initiatives, while the
lessons learnt from state-level work can be used by Government of India in formulating its
national policies, and scaled up by the Government to other states

L

A programmaticapproach The significant policy agenda contained in this strategy as well
as the experimental nature of some of the Bank's pro-poor rural development initiatives
require a long-term perspective The Bank's strategy therefore increasingly takes a
programmatic approach, matching instruments to the nature and content of the programs
pursued This progranumnatic
approach also enables the Bank to better mainstream social,
gender and environmental considerations into the program But it is demanding, and will
require increased focus on fiduciary safeguards, and monitoring and learning over the CAS
period

vi
The Bank Group's program priorities are defined around the Ninth Plan themes of
strengtheningthe enabling environment for development and sustainable growth and supporting
critical interventions of special benefit to the poor and disadvantaged
vii Strengtheningthe Enabling Environmentfor Development and Growth involves the
parallel and complementary tasks of improvinggovernment effectiveness and enabling the
private sector to contribute fully to economic development
* Improving government effectiveness India's deteriorating fiscal position warrants an
increased emphasis on fiscal reform There is also now a widespread consensus in India that
fiscal reforms need to be accompaniedby improvements in governance to tackle endemic
problems such as over-staffing, corruption, and poor budgetary management From the
vantage of selectivity, it is in the focus states that the Bank has the relationship and depth of
engagementnecessary to be most effective in this core reform area Fiscal and governance
reforms take several years to be effective, and the Bank's support needs to be flexible and
consistent enough to withstand the uncertainties India's complex political environment

-

generates Moving forward with reforms also requires assurance of a reasonable degree of
financial support over the medium term Hence the Bank's planned use of programmatic
structural adjustment loans to the states as a means of providingpredictable performancebased budget support and enabling the states to restore their financial equilibrium while
undertakingreforms at the same time Equally important, the Bank is integrating crosscutting governancereforms into the design of sectoral operationsand into the Bank's sectoral
dialogue to improve service delivery and strengthen government effectiveness on a sector-bysector basis The Bank is also strengthening its dialogue with Gol on fiscal and governance
issues, and deepening its analytical base
Promoting private-sector led growth is the area in which the synergies between the
different parts of the Bank Group can be best realized Activities in this area will be oriented
towards four main goals supportingthe provision of adequate infrastructure,both through an
expanded role for the private sector and through better public-sector management and
increased funding; accelerating rural growth, through agricultural deregulation and expanded
provision of rural infrastructure; improvingcompetitivenessin industry and services, through
IFC support for restructuring and growth of internationallycompetitive firms, work on
improvingthe investment climate at the state level, and dialogue at the national level on
"second-generationreforms", and selective interventions to support financial sector
development
viii Pro-poor Interventions India's poverty reduction strategy recognizes the importance of
government intervening to ensure that opportunitiesfor improved livelihood are widely available
across the entire spectrum of society, that the security of these livelihoods is promoted and that
the constraints that inhibit and exclude people from participating in and sharing the benefits of
development are removed The Bank's focus on two areas - promoting education and health for
all, and supportingpro-poor rural development- reflects their critical importance as well as the
Bank's comparative advantage
*

Promoting Health and Education for All The Bank Group will continue its strong support
for the social sectors, with a special focus on promoting gender equity In education, the
successful Bank-Gol partnership in respect of the District Primary Education Program is
approaching a new phase The Governmenthas decided to replace DPEP with a new,
expanded Education for All program, as a result, Bank support is likely to be extended
beyond lower primary to upper primary The Bank Group's health work will be increasingly
decentralized and tied to building state capacity, more focused on the relative strengths of
government, local communities, NGOs and the private sector, and will pay greater attention
to environmental health issues

*

Pro-poor rural development The Bank's rural projects are designed not only to develop
rural infrastructure, but to directly attack rural poverty, enhance social protection, and protect
the natural resource base for the approximately 75% of India's poor who live in rural areas
Interventions in this area are designed to be community-based,to target vulnerable groups
(women, scheduled castes and tribes, landless) and to support decentralization to and
empowerment at the local level

ix
IBRD/IDA Program The India portfolio is one of the Bank's largest Portfolio
performance in the nineties has been average, but there are indications of improvement in the
second half of the nineties, which we plan to sustain through our portfolio improvement strategy
The IBRD/IDA lending scenarios are unchanged from those in the previous CAS, with a base
case of US$3 billion and a low case of about half that level The strategy calls for an increasing
use of programmatic adjustment loans to support state reforms, expected to account for about
US$500-900 million a year in the base case The program is largely self-regulating in that it is

- iv

-

predicated on policy reforms which, if delayed, will automatically shift the program from the base
case to the low case In addition, monitoring of key macroeconornicand structural variables as
well as portfolio performance will be used to decide on total lending volumes The current IDA
allocation to India is about US$850 million per year, on a per capita basis much below that which
could be justified by India's poverty and recent performance The self-regulating nature of the
program, on the other hand, will mean that IDA commitmentswill only be about half of current
allocations if structural reforms are stalled
x
IFC and MIGA Future investment volumes will depend upon further progress in key
policy reforms, particularly to open up opportunities for private investment in infrastructure,and
continued liberalization of the investment and trade regime IFC investments will mainly be
concentrated in infrastructure,the financial sector (including wholesaling of funds to small and
medium enterprises) and mid-size manufacturing and service companies

As IFC's experience in

the social sectors builds up, it also plans to invest more in health and education On current
trends, 1FC approvals are expected to total around US$1 0-1 5 billion over FY01-03 compared to
approximately US$300 mnillionin the FY98-00 period Local currency and guarantee products are
expected to account for a significant proportion of new lending MIGA currently has no India
exposure, but has just concluded a marketing tour, and expects high demand once India's
infrastructure sectors are restructured
xi
Non-Lending Services will be used to bolster lending effectiveness, to meet due diligence
requirements at both the national and the state level, and to promote capacity building and
knowledge sharing, in cases where it is importantto open the dialogue on development and
poverty reduction challenges, e g , in poor non-reformringstates, or where policy reforms are
required without a correspondingneed for financial assistance (e g financial sector,
macroeconomic dialogue with Gol)
?

xii Benefits and Risks India today represents a window of opportunity for the Bank Group
and the benefits of this program of support are huge Without successful poverty reduction in
India, it will be impossible to achieve the International Development Goals But there are also
many risks, chiefly relating to sustainability- of the reform process, of the country's fiscal
position, and of many of the pro-poor interventions supported by the Bank Group The
programmatic approach, alignment to India's poverty reduction strategy, the emphasis on
monitoring and learning and the self-regulatingnature of the lending program are all intended to
mitigate these risks
xiii

Items for Board Discussion

*

Does the Bank Group strategy adequately support the Government's poverty reduction
strategy and contribute to making progress towards achieving the International Development
Goals, an objective closely dependent on India's success in reducing poverty?

•

Selectivity is especially important in a country as large as India Is the Bank Group strategy
sufficiently selective and is the balance between its state focus and a sustained policy
dialogue with the Governmentof India appropriate?

*

The Bank Group strategy includes IBRD/IDA lending levels similar to those of the last CAS
and in particular assumes the maintenance of at least the current level of IDA allocation Is
the proposed lending and non-lending program adequate to address India's needs? Do the
self-activating as well as the macroeconomic and structural triggers provide appropriate
mechanisms to regulate lending in light of performance?

Poverty reduction is India's most compelling challenge, a challenge of global
significance According to Bank figures (World Development Indicators 2000), India has
some 470 million people living on less than US$1 a day, twice the number of poor in SubSaharan Africa, and 36% of the total number of poor in the world (Box 1) Estimates based
on India's own official poverty lines indicate that there were 350 million poor living in India
in the mid-1990s By either standard, poverty remains an enormous problem

Since the First Five Year Plan (1951-1955),India's policy makers have recognized
the massive scale of India's poverty Over nine Plan periods, India has been able to raise its
growth rate from 2% in the first half of the 1950s to 6% in the last two decades, the highest
outside East Asia While this growth has been associated with a significant reduction in the
rate of poverty in the seventies and eighties, statistical problems in recent household surveys
make it difficult to know with certainty what happened to poverty in the 1990s There has in
fact been an intense debate over recent poverty trends in India The emerging consensus
appears to be that there was some fall in poverty in the nineties, but the size of the decline is
still unclear
3
India's non-income poverty is also of international proportions: 20% of children out
of school in the world are estimated to be in India, and the country accounts for some 20% of
the world's gender gap in elementaryeducation Most non-income dimensions of well being
are improving Literacy and school enrollments are rising, and infant mortality is declining,
as are fertility rates However, infant and maternal mortality remain high, and there are new
challenges too, including a resurgence of tuberculosis and the spread of H1V/AIDSwhich,
unchecked, could become a major threat to India's future HIV/AIDS prevalence is about 4
million, up from less than half a million in the early nineties
4
While some gender indicators have improved, with a rapidly declining gender gap in
enrollment and female life expectancy now exceeding male, the overall picture remains one
of stark inequality The sex ratio declined from 972 females per 1000 males in 1901 to 927
according to the last Census in 1991, though the Ninth Plan targets an improvement to 943 by
2002 Amartya Sen attributes India's serious sex imbalance to "the comparative neglect of
female health and nutrition, especially - but not exclusively - during childhood "
5
These aggregate indicators hide massive regional variations in terms of both income
and non-income dimensions across India's states, as Table 1 indicates While the disparities
between states in non-income indicators are declining, albeit slowly, income gaps appear to
be growing Richer states grew faster over the nineties, and may also have done better at
reducing poverty

Well documented in India's developmentplans and economic literature, the multifaceted nature of poverty in India has been recently brought out by "Voices of the Poor", a
series of interviews with the poor carried out by an Indian NGO, a summary of which is
presented in Annex 1 Interviews with India's poor revealed their vulnerability - to disease,
crop failures, labor market fluctuations,domestic violence, natural disasters, floods and
cyclones - and their ensuing sense of insecurity All such events hit the poor particularly
hard, and are generally importantcauses of falling, or falling deeper, into poverty
7
India's physical environment is deteriorating in both urban and rural areas A recent
Bank estimate of annual environmental degradation in India is about 6-8% of GDP About
40% of this cost is related to the burden of disease due to unsafe water and poor sanitation,
35% due to air pollution, including both indoor and urban air pollution, 15% due to soil
degradation, and 10% due to other forms of degradation of natural resource such as forests
and fisheries The poor are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of environmental
degradation More than 20% of urban dwellers live in slums and are grossly over-exposed to
air and water pollution Conditions are particularly adverse in India's largest cities The
elderly, children, and the poor suffer disproportionatelyfrom adverse health impacts linked to
pollution and overcrowding Solutions to India's full range of environmental problems can
only come through the integration of environmental considerations with the overall
developmentand reform process

B. POLITICAL ANDECONOMIC CONTEXT- A DECADE OF CHANGE
POLITICAL
DEVELOPMENTS
8
Greater openness, transparency, and competition have influenced India's political and
economic life in the 1990s On the political front, notwithstandingoccasional religious and
ethnic tensions, the world's largest democracy has continued to accommodate extraordinary
diversity - linguistic, ethnic, religious, regional, and social Constitutional amendments in
1993 have given legal foundation to local governments, and strengthened participatory
processes at the local level, including a mandatory requirement that one-third of local
representatives be women, and that seats be reserved for the scheduledcastes and tribes in
proportion to their population Electoral processes have become more transparent and rulebound with the Election Commission asserting its autonomy in a more forthright manner In
the federal government, there has been a consistent growth in the influence of small parties
representing regional or special interests As a result, no government in the 1990s has
commandedan absolute majority in Parliament, and all governments in this decade have had
to rely on the implicit or explicit support of small parties
9
India saw three elections in three years during 1996-99 The election of September
1999 led to a relatively more stable coalition government, its members being elected on the
basis of a common program The national agenda has thus been able to focus on economic
and developmentalissues, though it continues to be buffeted by occasional political
uncertainty On balance, this has led to some forward movement on the reform front
However, expectations of rapid reform have given way to the realization that the pace will
still be gradual because of political costs, coalition politics, and the diversity of opinions
within the country

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

10
Economic growth The reforms introduced in the 1990s have led to large
improvements in economic performance Growth surged to an unprecedented 7% during
1993-97,and has averaged 6% since More importantlyperhaps, growth in the 1990s was
based on greater openness, negligible current account deficits (around 1% of GDP), high
levels of foreign exchange reserves (US$42 billion as of February 2001), and a significant
increase in the share of private in total investment
11
Global integration India has become much more integrated with the world
economy over the nineties Imports and exports have increased their share in GDP by ten
percentage points On the policy side, quantitative restrictions are being phased out, and will
be eliminated by April 2001, tariffs have declined, and FDI procedures have been streamilined
and liberalized This progress notwithstanding,India remains one of the most protected
economies in the world Tariffs were more than halved in the first half of the nineties (from
an average rate of 128% in 1990-91 to 41% in 1995-96),but have fallen very slowly since
and are still very high by international standards (30% on average) Foreign direct
investment, though higher than in the early nineties, is still very low compared to other large
developing countries (US$2 5 billion per year compared to US$32 billion in Brazil and nearly
US$40 billion in China, in the second half of the 1990s) Attracting substantially higher FDI
inflows will require the government to continue to reduce regulatory restrictions, move on
domestic liberalization, and improve the business environment
12
India's private sector now faces twin challenges to expand its role into areas
formerly in the preserve of government or public enterprises, and to reduce its reliance on
protection and regulation and become internationallycompetitive The potential of the private
sector in India is nowhere more evident than with respect to information technology The IT
sector has shown tremendous growth in recent years, with revenues estimated at US$8 billion
in 2000 IT software exports are already worth about US$3 billion compared to total
merchandise exports of US$43 billion, and are growing at 50% a year In contrast, other parts
of India's private sector reflect the legacy of a long period of heavy regulation and protection
Many sectors are characterized by excess capacity, but consolidation and restructuring is
made difficult by the closely held nature of most firms, and the weakness of company balance
sheets Most companies are over-leveraged,with access to equity markets limited to the very
top tier of companies Similarly, access to bank credit is severely limited (especially for
longer tenors) to all but the top 'blue chip' borrowers
13
Agriculture, while never regulated to the extent of industry, still suffers from a
plethora of regulations, the lifting of which has just begun Growth was about 3% through the
nineties, similar to that of the eighties, but below the government's target of 4% Despite a
slowing-down in food-grain production, India is currently suffering from a glut of grains, and
public storage levels are at some 45 million tonnes, well above buffer requirements, and a
drain on public finances While terms of trade for agriculture have improved over the nineties
for agriculture, India is currently suffering from low world prices for most primary
commodities Meanwhile, the input subsidies agriculture has come to rely on - for fertilizers,
power and water - are unsustainable Reforming the agricultural sector will be a priority in
the coming years
14
Financial sector Even before the reforms of the nineties, India had a well-developed
financial system, well above what would usually be expected of a country at India's level of
development During the nineties, with deregulationof interest rates, easing of directed

India Country Assistance Strategy

Page 5

credit, strengtheningof prudential regulation norms and supervisoryagencies, and some
freeing of entry, the financial system has become sounder, with lower levels of nonperforming assets and much higher capitalization There is, nevertheless, a difficult and
unfinished agenda, recently explored by a high level committee (the second Narasimham
Committee on financial sector reform), a Bank sector study on banking, and a joint BankIMF Financial Sector Assessment Program
15
India's financial sector mobilizes substantialresources but invests a large part of
them in government debt - about 40% of deposits in the case of banks - well above minimum
statutory requirements This pattern of asset holding, reflective of India's long history of large
fiscal deficits, reduces India's susceptibilityto financial crisis, but also reduces credit
availability to the private sector Non-performingassets, net of provisions, are a small
fraction of total bank assets (2 7%) or GDP (under 2%), but are large relative to lending to the
private sector and the banks' capital Regulation and supervision have improved substantially
since the 1980s and are largely up to international standards, but far from best practice A bill
to reduce government equity in public banks to 33% was tabled in Parliament in December
2000, but has not yet been debated, the Finance Ministry has indicated that the proposal
would not change the essential public sector character of these banks India's capital markets
are deep for a low-income country, and improvementshave been made to make transactions
more secure, and strengthen minority shareholders' rights, but further reforms to improve
transparency, and develop the long-term debt market are needed Insurance was recently
reformed to allow new entrants, with minority participation by foreigners Judicial
enforcement of loan contracts remains slow, despite attempts at improvement
16
Macroeconomic performance and fiscal deficits India's macroeconomic
performance over the nineties has generally been satisfactory(Table 2), and the country
successfully weathered the East Asia crisis However, the country's inability to reduce its
fiscal deficits at both the central and state levels has been a persistent problem over the past
two decades Over the last few years, India's fiscal performance has deteriorated, and the
general government deficit is now at 9 1%, about the same as at the start of the nineties The
deterioration has been particularly sharp at the state level (para 22) India's fiscal deficits are
an obstacle to reduce inflation to international levels, imply higher real interest rates and a
heavy burden of interest payments for the government (which crowds out government
spending in capital formation and in the social sectors), and negatively affect economic
growth
17
India's large fiscal deficit poses a serious constraint to monetary policy and debt
managementpolicy If the deficit is financed mostly by expanding Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) credit to the government, the effect will be higher inflation and pressure for the
depreciation of the Rupee and, eventually, higher nomninalinterest rates If the deficit is
financed mostly by borrowing in the domestic market (and monetary policy kept tight), the
effect will be higher real interest rates and crowding out of private sector demand-as
happened in 1999-00 While in the past, government control over the financial sector
allowed borrowing at very low real interest rates, this will no longer be the case in future
given the gradual liberalization of the financial sector

Effectively addressing India's fiscal deficits requires a combination of steady
improvement in tax revenue collection, rationalization of government spending and structural
reform to strengthen economic growth There is an active tax reform agenda under
implementation, with the aim of reversing India's declining tax-GDP ratio The Expenditure
Reform Commission has recommended various reforms to cut wasteful spending The Fifth
Pay Commnission's recommendations for a steep decline in the staff strength of the civil
service and changes in business processes are now starting to be gradually implemented In
addition, the tabling of a Fiscal Responsibility Bill in India's Parliament is an important step
to provide legislative backing to greater fiscal discipline, though the impact of this type of
legislation will be limited if the government does not implement effective tax reform and
gradually rationalize public spending A number of states have produced White Papers to
inform the public of their fiscal predicament, and are following it up with multi-year mediumterm fiscal frameworks to define a path towards fiscal sustainability

Medium-term prospects and external environment In the medium term, given the
current rates of growth of the labor force (above 2%), capital stock (about 5 5 %) and
productivity (about 2% per annum), maintaining an average rate of economic growth of 66 5% is feasible for India (Table 3) However, reaching the 7-9% growth target set by the

Ninth Plan for the years after 2002 will require higher investment and, correspondingly,

higher savings To attract higher domestic and foreign investment,India has to improve the
quality of the regulatory environment to eliminate distortions and strengthen competition
domestically and with the rest of the world To increase the share of domestic savings
available to finance new investment, India has to reduce its large fiscal imbalances - this will
also strengthen macroeconomic stability and attract foreign savings While the volume of
private international capital flows worldwide has fallen in recent years from their peak in the
mid 1990s,India's economic prospects and strong external position have kept it an attractive
destination It will remain so if it stays the course of reform The recent budget (February
2001) proposes to liberalize agriculture and labor markets, open the trade regime and
deregulate small-scale industries further, reform the pension system, and simplify and
strengthenthe tax system Relatively low interest rates and growing world trade will
continue to be supportive of India's integration in the global economy
EMERGINGROLE OF THE STATES IN ECONOMICPOLICIES

20
India is a Union of 28 States and 7 Union Territories Half of these 28 states are
larger than most countries in the world, with populations in excess of 30 million people
(Table 1) India's Constitution grants considerable power to the states in terms of regulatory
oversight, tax and expenditure assignments, provision of infrastructure, and provision of
social services The states account for 51% of general government spending (center, states,
and local) and a much higher proportion (75% to over 90%) of public spending on health,
education, and irrigation Before the 1990s, states' discretion in policy making was limited
by the dominance of national political parties and central planning The changes in the 1990s
have made the quality of a state's own economic and social management a much more
important determinant of its growth and social performance
21
In taking on their new responsibilities,the states have been confronted with the
legacy of several decades of central planning In particular, they inherited a large stock of
infrastructure- in the form of irrigation, power and water utilities, roads, etc - without
established cost recovery and accountabilitysystems to ensure their financial viability,
maintenance, and expansion over time The states also inherited overstaffed and poorly
govemnedpublic agencies for infrastructure and social service delivery systems
22
The result of the above has been serious fiscal problems, high indebtedness, and a
deteriorating composition of expenditure in favor of salaries, pensions and interest, and away
from non-wage operations and maintenance and capital spending State-level fiscal deficits
have approximately doubled as a percentage of GDP from their level of three years ago, in
large part due to an overly-generousnational pay settlement Many states are now facing a
liquidity crisis, under which they are unable to keep current on their obligations to creditors
and suppliers The states' resultant inability to step up development spending in health,
education, and infrastructure has emerged as one of the most important constraints to
development in India Accelerating state reforms is therefore of critical importance
23
Structural reforms are required to reduce the role of the state in the economy to
improve state-level finances, and increase accountability,effectiveness, and transparency
Implementingthis agenda has proven much more difficult and time-consuming than anyone
expected While progress is primarily dependent on reform breakthroughs and turnaround in
individual states, and then on inter-state demonstrationand competition effects to increase the
spread and momentum of reform, leadership of the central government will be critical in
accelerating state reforms

India Country Assistance Strategy

Page8

24
Though adoption of structural reforms at the state level has been slow, several
important sectoral and fiscal reform initiatives have been taken over the last few years
Perhaps the first was the restructuring and privatization of the power sector in the state of
Orissa, and, starting slightly later, the comprehensivefiscal and sectoral reform program of
the Government of Andhra Pradesh Other states which have initiated important fiscal,
sectoral and governance reforms include Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh
and Rajasthan
C. INDIA'S POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY
THE FIvE YEAR PLANS AND POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY
25

India has developed elaborate consultative and consensus-building processes for the

formulation of economic and social policies The Planning Commission, and the Five Year
Plans it produces, have a special role in this process and in articulating the country's poverty
reduction strategy While a product of the Central Government, the Plans are developed
through wide consultations, including at the National Development Council, the national
forum for central and state governments India's current strategyfor poverty reduction is
articulated in considerable detail in the Ninth Five Year Plan, which covers the period 1997
to 2002, and the Mid-Term Appraisal completed in October 2000 The rest of this section
draws on these two documents in summarizing India's poverty reduction strategy
GROWTHWITHSOCIALJUSTICEANDEQUITY
26
The overriding objective of India's poverty reduction strategy today is growth with
socia justice and equity While projecting public and private investment requirements, the
Plan gives greater priority, in a liberalized environment, to "planning for policy" and
suggesting the major directions for policy reforms and interventions Issues related to

governance and institutions are also a theme of the strategy, which envisages greater local
participation to improve the effectiveness of delivery mechanisms for poverty reduction, and
which emphasises the empowerment of women, the poor and local communities
27
The Plan's 15-year long-term perspective targets an average annual growth rate of
7 4%, starting with 6 5% for the Ninth Plan period and increasing in successive Plan periods,
with a view to reducing poverty to below 10% of the population over this period The Plan
targets a current account deficit of 2 1% of GDP and a combined center-state fiscal deficit of
6 8% of GDP, which is sustainable with inflation of around 7%
28
Given the enormous size and complexity of the task at hand, India's poverty
reduction strategy necessarily envisages a multi-pronged approach, which is massive in its
scope It is not possible to provide a full summary here The following sections outline three
key elements of India's strategy of particular relevance to the Bank Group program, namely
(i) promoting faster growth and development by increasing government effectiveness and
private sector development, (ii) increasing the effectiveness of pro-poor interventions, and
(iii) increasing the role of the states in poverty reduction and reforms

Fiscal sustainability The Plan documents note the precariousness of the current

Page9

reforms focusing on base broadening and improving compliance will halt the decline in the
tax-to-GDP ratio Tighter expenditure controls are also important, especially in relation to the
wage bill Subsidies, both explicit subsidies at the central level, such as for food and
fertilizers, and implicit at the state level, such as for power, higher education and irrigation,
will need to be cut
30
Improving the quality of governance is emerging as a key element of India's
poverty reduction strategy In his address to the National Development Council meeting held
on February 19, 1999, the Prime Minister stated "People often perceive the bureaucracy as
an agent of exploitation rather than a provider of service Corruption has become a low risk
and high reward activity Frequent and arbitrary transfers (of government officials)
combined with limited tenures are harming the work ethics and lowering the morale of honest
officers While expecting discipline and diligencefrom the administration, the political
executive should self-critically review its own performance Unless we do this, we cannot
regain credibility in the eyes of the people who have elected us to serve them
31
As highlighted in the Plan, the bureaucracy is becoming increasingly subject to
political interference, a phenomenon most manifest in the shrinking average tenure attached
to many government positions, especially at the state level The judicial system is not
functioning well currently an estimated 25 million cases are pending in various courts
Tackling these, and related problems, will require reforms dealing with the civil service, the
judicial system, anti-corruption strategies, etc, and the active involvementof civil society
The Mid-TermAppraisal outlines a comprehensive strategy along these lines and highlights
that "administrativeand legal reforms should be an integralpart of the reform agenda
32
One very important developmentover the nineties is the devolution of
responsibilities to the third-tier or local governments In the wake of the 73rd and 74th
Amendments, adopted in 1993,many states have developed ambitious plans for
decentralizationthat are at various stages of implementation The Plan endorses the move
towards decentralization, and notes that both local governments and user groups have a role
to play in enhancing beneficiary participation and control
33
Privatization Although successive governmentsthrough the nineties have
proclaimed their commitment to privatization, or disinvestment,the Plan acknowledges that
actual progress made has been very slow This remains a controversial area of policy,
although the Finance Minister announced last year that government equity in nearly all public
enterprises would be brought down to 26% or less While some transactions are underway,
progress remains unsatisfactory, the government strategy calls for the process of
disinvestment to be accelerated
34
Domestic and external liberalization Growth in India benefited greatly from the
reduction of industrial investment licensing regulations However, the business environment
continues to be unpredictable, discretionary and burdensome The government strategy
recognizes the importance of further domestic liberalization,including (i) immediate
abolition of small-scale reservations in critical export areas, and phasing-out of reservations
in other areas, (ii) deregulation in labor policy, accompaniedby introduction of
unemployment insurance, (iii) completion of the dismantling of administrativeprices (e g, in
petroleum products), and (iv) reduction of clearance delays and harassment of businesses by
excessive inspection requirements To continue the liberalizationof the external regime
initiated in 1991, the strategy calls for a time frame to be laid down for a phased reduction of
tariffs from their current average level of 30% to an average of 10%

India Country Assistance Strategy

Page 10

35
Agricultural reforms Attacking rural poverty will require deregulation and more
liberal rural policies as well as an expansion of rural infrastructure to boost agricultural
growth and tackle the problems identified in para 13 The Ninth Plan thus sets out a multidimensionalreform agenda for improving incentives to produce, rationalizing subsidies and
promoting investments, besides extending protective cover to the poor A review and
elimination of myriad controls in the domestic market for agricultural produce is presented as
an urgent necessity Other rural development reforms identified pertain to rural credit, land
reforms, and the development of rain-fed areas and exploitation of ground water potential
36
Infrastructure bottlenecks The Plan recognizes that infrastructure bottlenecks
have become a major constraint on growth Although public investment in infrastructure will
remain central, mobilization of private investment is also important The Plan recognizes that
private investment has been deterred by the slow pace of policy reform, the high degree of
uncertainty over the policy and regulatory frameworks, the unreliability of the legal system to
enforce contracts, and exposure to political interference and corruption Key infrastructure
sectoral issues include the following
*

The transport sector is one that the Plan recognizes will continue to rely largely on
public investment Currently, it is inefficient and under-funded, resulting in growing
congestion and longer delays, all of which push up costs for Indian producers The
government is moving towards improvingroad sector management, creating various road
funds at the state and central levels financed by road users through diesel/petrol cess, and
making tangible progress on the proposed "quadrilateral" national highway linking the
four largest cities in the country

*

Urban infrastructure Despite the relative deceleration in India's rate of urbanization
over the last 20 years, the gap between demand and supply of basic urban services has
widened as a result of ineffective management,inadequate funding and poor project
development Urban water has good potential for private sector participation, but the
basic regulatory framework and commercial orientation is yet to develop

*

Power sector reform According to the Government's strategy, "reforms in the energy
sector should start with the restructuringof State Electricity Boards (SEBs) Unbundling
the SEBs and separating generation, transmission and distribution into separate
corporationswill make it possible to monitor efficiency levels in each activity and also to
create appropriate incentivesfor efficiency in each area Unbundling will also make it
easier to allow private sector operators in each area in a suitable manner "

37
Skilled labor The bottlenecks constraining growth in India also include shortages of
appropriately skilled and trained personnel Although India has one of the world's largest
stocks of scientists, engineers and technicians, the quality of their training below the first tier
is poor The Ninth Plan documents give a basic thrust to improving the quality and relevance
of technical education by networking institutions both in government and the private sector,
linking institutions with industry and community better, and developing "centersof
excellence " The Plan also places emphasis on issues of governance of universities and
colleges, and resource mobilization, including full cost recovery from students who can
afford to pay
MORE EFFECTIVEPRO-POOR INTERVENTIONS

38
India's poverty reduction strategy is based on the premise that "economic growth and
employment opportunitiesin themselves may not be sufficient to improve the living conditions

India CountryAssistanceStrategy

Page11

of the poor They need to be accompanied by measures which enhance the social and
physical conditions of existence " The Ninth Plan recognizes that, "despite considerable
efforts,provision of social infrastructure and services remain inadequate Primary
education, primary health care, safe drinking water, nutrition and sanitation require heavy
investmentwhich has to be provided out of public funds Furthermore, recognizing the
localized nature of these essential services, it is desirable that control over operation and
maintenance of the facilities should be in the hands of peoples' institutions and local
associations "
39
Education India's poverty reduction strategy looks at education as "the most vital
and crucial investment in human development," with elementary education receiving the
highest priority The Ninth Plan seeks to achieve universal elementary education (age 6-14)
through several measures
* Amendment of the Constitution to make elementary education a fundamental right
* Decentralization of planning, supervision, and managementof education through local
bodies
* Social mobilization of local communitiesfor adult literacy campaigns andfor
promotion of primary education
* Stronger partnership with NGOs and voluntary organizations
* Advocacy and media campaigns
* Provision of opportunitiesfor non-formal and alternative educationfor out of school
children in the most backward areas andfor unreached segments of the population
The Cabinet has recently sanctioned the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (Education for All), a
centrally sponsored scheme within which all existing government programs supporting
elementary education will be placed and which will provide substantial additional financial
support to the states
40
Health In the Ninth Plan, the focus is on integrating communicable, noncommunicable and nutrition related health services, through strengthening and better
utilization of existing health care institutions The Plan aims to minimize the existing
disparities between states and ensure that reforms do not result in deterioration of health
status in poorer segments of the population Special attention is given to gearing up to combat
the new threat of HIV/AIDS The National Population Policy 2000 affirms the government's
commitment to gender-sensitivepolicies with a holistic approach to population and
development through decentralized planning and program implementation It focuses on
health communication and behavior change, convergence of service delivery at the village
level, meeting the unmet needs for family welfare services, ensuring coverage of the underserved population in urban slums and tribal communities, and increasing collaboration with
the private sector and NGOs
41
More effective anti-povertyprograms India spends heavily on anti-poverty
programs in rural areas, but many question the efficiency and efficacy of these expenditures
and their vulnerability to corruption and rent seeking The Mid-Term Appraisal notes that the
"role of anti-povertyprograms to supplement the growth effort is not only valid in the postreform period but becomes even greater to protect the rural poor against adverse
consequences of economic reforms " However, the government recognizes the need to
restructure such programs for effective implementation and for enhancing the productivity of
the beneficiaries in the rural areas "A major weakness in the implementation of poverty
alleviationprograms has been the lack of participation by the people for whom the programs

India Country Assistance Strategy

Page 12

are meant Strong local governance such as expectedfrom Panchayati Raj Institutions responsive to the needs of beneficiaries, encouraging mobilization of the rural poor and open
to social audit - promises better delivery of poverty alleviation programs
THE ROLE OF THE STATES IN POVERTY REDUCTION AND REFORMS

42

The government's poverty reduction strategy explicitly recognizes the importance of

state-level reform, and envisages "healthy competition among the statesfor evolving efficient
and socially desirable policies " It puts forward the concept of "cooperative federalism,"

whereby much greater freedom would be given to states to determine not only their own
priorities but also the modalities of public intervention and provision of goods and services

Box 2: Reforms in the States
Reforms in the states should consist of the following elements
I Tax Reforms A tax reform program which includes rationalization of tax structure is an area of high
priority It is essential to restore the buoyancy of tax revenues and increase tax / SDP ratios
2 Expenditure Reform States must initiate comprehensive expenditure reform programs to reduce
unproductive and wasteful expenditure on one hand and improve the quality of expenditure on the other
Unwarranted rapid increases in salaries and subsidies of recent years must be curbed On the other hand,

capital expenditure and maintenance, which have been experiencing shortfalls, must be protected Wage bill
of the states needs to be closely monitored
3 Improvement in Fiscal Administration and Management Strengthening, streamlining and simplification of
the tax machinery is a must to check tax evasion and promote tax compliance It will also help to improve
business environment Moreover improved management of expenditure will ensure more efficient use of scarce

funds This will entail reforms in budgeting, accounting, internal control and audit, cash and debt
management and management informationsystem
4 Public Sector Enterprises Reform including Disinvestment Public sector enterprises, in particular the SEBs
[State Electricity Boards] and the SRTCs [State Road Transport Corporations] have proved to be a big drain
on states resources States must implement reforms to bring these enterprises under professional management
and run them in a commercially viable manner
5 Power Sector Reforms: Power sector reforms are essential if states are to get back on the path offiscal
sustainability SEBs are the single most important drain on states' resources Power tariffs must ensure cost
recovery and the culture of non-payment of dues by customers to public utilities must be curbed
6 Improved Infrastructure The state of infrastructure both physical and social, is acting as a drag on growth
in most states Infrastructure sector calls for urgent intervention if the growth process is to be accelerated and
states finances are to benefit More efficient management, higher investment and greater cost recovery would,
in general, be required in these areas User charges for water, transport and other services must be suitably
enhanced

43
Unlike the reforms of the early nineties, what is needed now are reforms at the state
as well as the central government level The Mid-Term Appraisal sets out a comprehensive
reform program for the states (Box 2) The Plan also calls on the states to be more active in
universalizing primary education, increasing the literacy rate, and improving health
indicators

44
Since the last CAS, the Bank has done extensive work on poverty, with the objective
of understanding its social, human and economic dimensions as well as the priority measures
needed to reduce poverty and improve living conditions A comprehensive social and
structural policy review (SSPR) completed last year, used poverty reduction as a central and

unifying theme The Executive Summary of this report, which provides an overview of the
Bank's analysis of the poverty issue in India, is attached as Annex 2 Comparisonof the
findings from the Bank's analytical work, including the recent World Development Report on
Poverty (2000/01), and the government's diagnosis and strategyreveals a high-level of shared
understanding with respect to both the constraints to poverty reduction and the measures
required to relax these constraints In particular, there is broad consensus over the major
challenges facing India today
* To accelerate growth and widen economic opportunitiesfor the poor, through higher
investments and improved maintenance in key sectors (e g , in agriculture, infrastructure)
and a better policy environment
* To expand human capabilities, which means achieving India's goal of education for all,
and significant improvements in health status and security through more effective
provision of basic services at the local level
* To ensure basic entitlements - food, shelter, safety - for all people, to reduce risk and
provide adequate protection for the vulnerable, destitute, and socially marginalized - in
particular women and children from poor families, and
* To empower India's poorest citizens, by bringing them into the process of decisionmaking at all levels - this requires a public sector that is more effective, transparent, and
accountable to citizens at all levels
45
One recurring theme of both Bank's analytical work and Plan documents is the need
to accelerate the pace of reform The problem in India is not that the constraints to poverty
reduction are not well understood, the problem is rather that reforms are very difficult to
implement,at both the central government level and, increasingly, at the state level
Reversing decades of populism and neglect does not come easily The primary challenge for
the Bank Group is therefore one of providing incentives for reform, and assisting with
implementation In this regard, the Bank Group can play an important role by aligning itself
to India's national strategy for poverty reduction, and finding areas within which it can make
a significant contribution Part II of the CAS details the Bank Group's strategy and program
from this perspective

II. THE BANK GROUP'S STRATEGY
A. INPUTS TO STRATEGY FORMULATION
COUNTRY ASSISTANCE EVALUATION

46
The Bank's program in India over the last ten years has recently been the subject of a
Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE) by the Operations Evaluation Department The overall
rating of the CAE for the decade is moderately satisfactory With respect to the last CAS
period (1998-2000),the CAE concludes "The relevance of the assistance strategy, however,
has improved substantially over the past two years through a more sharpened focus on
poverty reduction, a more selective approach to state assistance and greater attention to
governance and institutions Although it is too early to gauge its efficacy, recent initiatives
hold strong promise of substantial improvement in performance " The main
recommendations of the CAE are the following'
*

To enhance the effectiveness of its assistance, the Bank should (i) link the overall
lending volumes to fiscal discipline at the federal level and to progress in structural
refonns in agriculture and the implementation of an effective rural development strategy,
as progress in these areas is crucialfor rural poverty reduction, and (ii)further
concentrate new lending in reforming states, where an assistance strategy has been
agreed with the state government Similarly, sectoral lending volumes should be linked
to agreements on sector-specific policies and institutionalframeworks

*

The Bank should systematically monitor the poverty and gender impacts of Bank-assisted
projects andprograms It should also assist government agencies to do the samefor the
overall public expenditure programs

*

The Bank should strengthen aid coordination on country assistance strategies and on
critical sector strategies (e g, agriculture and rural development) Greater coordination
would enhance the effectiveness of external assistance, and would enable greater
selectivity in the Bank's own programs

LESSONS LEARNT FROM THE LAST

CAS

Experience with implementationof the last CAS has been positive, but has taught a
number of lessons

47

*

The focus on reforming states over the last three years has brought many benefits State
reforms have, however, been more difficult to initiate and sustain than expected, and
many of the reforms the Bank Group is supporting are politically controversial The
benefits of reform (e g , fewer power blackouts, reliable drinking water supply, fiscal
sustainability) start appearing only after substantial initial cost (e g , higher tariffs,
reduced subsidies, staff retrenchment) and controversy (e g , privatization) For the
future, Bank support for reforms needs to give more attention to the electoral cycle at the

Bank management has largely endorsed these recommendations- see Annex 3 for the Management

state level and the importance of broad political ownershipof reforms
* The Bank has been heavily involved in power sector reforms for several years now,
beginning in Orissa in 1996, and now in five other states as well (Haryana, Andhra
Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Karnataka) Since then, privatization of
distribution, once dismissed as an option, has become national policy Independent
regulatory commnissionshave been established in almost all major states Power reforms
may, however, require much longer than the Bank had earlier anticipated Agricultural
and residential customers continue to receive huge subsidies, but are unwilling to pay
more until power quality improves Meanwhile, the burden of past financial losses is
mounting, and high-paying industrial consumers are leaving the grid, making the task of
privatization all the more difficult The adaptable program loan (APL) instrument has
proved to be effective in this context (para 64) A review, by external consultants, of the
Orissa experience has yielded useful lessons for implementingpower sector reforms
elsewhere
CONSULTATIONS
48
As part of the process of updating the Bank Group's country assistance strategy, a
series of consultations were organized both on experience with past assistance and on
priorities for the future Twelve sectoral workshops were organized in conjunction with
OED They were attended by 40 plus participants drawn from a range of backgrounds central and state government officials, NGOs, academics, private sector, and other
multilateral and bilateral agencies The final workshop was attended by a similarly diverse
group numbering over 100 in total These workshops gave participants the chance to look
both backwards, to review the past, and forwards, to make suggestions for the future, and
helped the Bank Group to ground its ambitions for the future in the reality of past
implementationoutcomes
49
Separate consultation workshops were conducted in the capitals of three states In
addition, IFC and the Bank conducted a consultation with representatives of the business
community in Mumbai A "Bank in India" image survey was commissioned to garner the
perceptions of different sectors of Indian society towards the World Bank Finally, a CAS
web site was established to continue the CAS dialogue in electronic form 2 Some of the main
findings of these consultations are summarizedin Annex 4

B. OVERVIEW OF BANK GROUP STRATEGY
50
Given the level of shared understandingbetween the Government and the Bank in
respect of both diagnosis and strategy, this CAS is built around the strategic objectives of
India's Ninth Five Year Plan This approach received strong support during the CAS
consultations The Bank Group's program objectives are thus defined around the Plan
themes of strengthening the enabling environmentfor development and growth and
supporting critical interventions of special benefit to the poor and disadvantaged To

translate the broad poverty reduction strategyof India to a specific Bank Group assistance
program, the strategic principles of selectivity, partnership, and a programmatic approach

C. STRATEGICPRINCIPLES
SELECTIVITY

51
Underlying both the selection of the Bank Group's strategic priorities and their
implementationis the principle of selectivity, especially important in a country as large and
as full of potential as India There is a need to focus, not just on what is important, but also on
where Bank Group assistance can have the greatest impact There are areas of business from
which the Bank Group has disengaged completely in the interests of selectivity For
example, it no longer supports crop-specific rural development schemes or the national
railways In other areas, a clear division of labor makes sense For example, IBRD/IDA will
no longer finance sectors such as thermal generation, telecom and ports, coal, oil and gas,
where the private sector can invest with support from IFC and MIGA as required Above all,
selectivity in the Indian context means (i) maintaining the state focus, (ii) selective

India Country Assistance Strategy

Page 17

interventionsin other, non-focus states, and (iii) a strong but selective program of
support for the Government of India.
State Focus

52
In line with the Plan's emphasis on the importance of state governments as
determinantsof India's success in reducing poverty (paras 42-43), the Bank's assistance
strategy has also been reoriented over the last CAS period It now focuses mainly on those
states that (i) have chosen to embark on a comprehensive program of economic reforms,
including fiscal and governance reforms and reforms of key sectors such as power, (ii) have
expressed interest in entering into a partnership with the Bank, and (iii) where poverty levels
are relatively high Andhra Pradesh (AP) became the Bank's first focus state three years ago
and has since been joined by Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Karnataka An active dialogue has also
been established with a few other states such as Orissa and Rajasthan Lending to the focus
states is expected to be about 40% of the Bank's lending program over the CAS period
53
The focus state strategy enables the Bank to initiate a ComprehensiveDevelopment
Framework (CDF) approach that would probably not be possible at the all-India level It
allows for a broad approach to be taken to promote growth and accelerate poverty reduction,
based on a deeper understanding of a state's specific social, political and economic position
as well as a wide-ranging and high-level partnership The Bank's assistance program in a
focus state is normally articulated around a state-specific assistance strategy Developed in
consultation with the Government of India, this builds on the vision and policy statements of
the state government and aims at maximizing the synergies between different lending and
non-lending activities, including institutional capacity building through technical assistance,
across a wide range of economic activities and through partnership with other donor agencies
to maximize impact The comprehensive reform agenda the Bank supports in the focus states
is based on that proposed by the Governmentof India for states to follow (Box 2)
54
An important question is whether the Bank might be missing a large segment of
India's poor by concentrating on a few reforming states In fact, most of India's poorer states
are embracing reform to one degree or another, and major funding agencies are active in all
of them The three states the Bank is currentlymost active in, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh
and Karnataka, for instance, are all relatively poor, either in terms of income poverty, or
social indicators, or both Moreover, the Bank intends to continue to support social sector
projects in India's poorest states, whether or not they are focus states, provided that there is
some assurance that the support will not be wasted due to corruption or poor governance In
some of the poorest but non-reforming states, policy dialogue and capacity building may well
be the most effective interventions of the Bank All states will benefit from the catalytic
demonstrationeffect of accelerated development in states pursuing comprehensive reforms
Unusual sectoral merit

55
In addition to working closely with a relatively small number of focus states, there
will be a continuing need for activities in other states, especially those pursuing important
sectoral reforms Such activities will need to be justified by using merit criteria, such as (i)
having an unusually high development or demonstration impact, because of their innovative
nature, or the importance, either of the investment, or of the reform being promoted (e g,
decentralized rural water supply in Kerala), (ii) extending support to the social sectors in
India's poorest states, provided there is a good likelihood of the funds being used effectively,

India Country Assistance Strategy

Page 18

or (iii) being in states which are not focus states for the Bank but nevertheless reforming at
least in some key sectors
Support for Government of India

56
The Bank's state focus needs to be balanced by a strong but selective program of
support to the national government On the lending side, there are a number of issues which
are best tackled at the national level, such as the development of a national highway system,
or the combating of infectious diseases, including HIV/AIDS On the non-lending side, the
Bank will continue to focus on technical assistance, dissemination,and dialogue on issues of
national importance where the Bank has international expertise The Bank plays a useful
convening role in India, and has organized and is planning a number of national conferences,
co-sponsored with the Government of India Four priority areas for policy dialogue in the
coming years at the national level are agriculture and rural development, fiscal and
governancereform, financial sector development, and health sector reforms
PARTNERSHIP AND OUTREACHI

57
To use the Bank Group's limited resources effectively and with catalytic impact
requires establishing partnerships with the Bank Group's clients and other donors and
stakeholders, based on a shared vision and principles The Government of India is of course
the Bank Group's principal partner, but additional partnerships are pursued with its support
IFC has important partnerships with a number of Indian financial institutions An illustrative
list of partnerships is presented in Annex 5, more details are provided in the country program
matrix (Annex B9)
58
Partnerships at the state level are particularly important in the context of the
Bank's state work First, integral to the state focus is the building of a close partnership with
the Bank's client, the reforming state government, that must be able to see in the Bank a
partner capable of providing sustained support while it implements politically difficult and
controversial reforms Second, the Bank's support to state governments is delivered in
partnership with the Central Government Lending to the states is pursued only with the
endorsement of the Govemment of India As the Government of India is increasingly turning
to performance and incentive-basedresource allocations (first for fiscal reforms, now for
power reforms), there are tremendous opportunitiesto deepen the partnership with Gol The
Bank's adjustment lending to Uttar Pradesh, for instance, was effectively co-financed by the
Central Governmentthrough their performance-basedfund allocations backed by a
Memorandum of Understandingcomprising policy conditions very similar to the adjustment
loan
59
Partnerships with donors area characteristic of most of the Bank's work In
highways, for instance, a joint Bank-ADBassistance strategy is being formulated Projects
prepared with the Bank's transport technical assistance project are being considered for
financing by ADB Partnerships with the UN family in its focus areas for India, of
decentralization and gender, are also important Partnerships will also continue to be a
mainstay of the Bank's engagement in the health sector (including HIV/AIDS, malaria,
leprosy, etc ) where bilateral donors and multilateral agencies (e g , UN, EU) have
traditionally concentrated their assistance Increasingly the Bank is working with NGOs and
other elements of the civil society in designing and implementing its projects

India Country Assistance Strategy

Page 19

60
Partnerships for the global environment The Bank-India partnership with the
Global Environmental Facility (GEF) and the Montreal Protocol includes the world's second
largest program to eliminate the production and use of ozone-depletingsubstances, and a
long-term partnership on climate change The climate change strategy is coordinated with
India's power reform programs (which will, in themselves, bring substantial global
environmental benefits) and promotes both renewable energy and energy efficiency gains It
will assist India in building its existing technologies and capabilities in climate-friendly
technologies as well as attracting possible future Clean Development Mechanism resources
With respect to bio-diversity, the South Asia Region's forestry, natural and water resources
strategies provide the basis for future GEF support A new India GEF strategy, currently
under discussion with the Governmentof India, is expected to lead to an expanded GEF
program in the coming years
61
Scaling up is essential in India for impact, and can only be done through
partnerships There are areas in the CAS where the Bank's experience has been relatively
limited but where bilateral donors as well as some multilateral agencies have developed an
impressive track record of successful experiments, particularly in rural development and
urban slum improvement Often the scale of these experiments is constrained by the volume
of resources available to them By building on these successful initiatives, the Bank is able to
scale them up The Bank itself can also pilot successful innovations, which Government of
India is then able to scale up Box 3 gives some examples of successful scaling-up
experiences in which the Bank has been involved

projects India is now committed to institutionalizinga demand-driven,community-based approach for rural

has nowagreedwith the Governmentof Indiaon a genericproject/program

The reforms adopted in that state - corporatization and unbundling of the electricity board, followed by
privatization,establishment of an independentregulator - are now being pursued by many states, with the
encouragementof and incentives from the Central Government.

62

Outreach. An important complement to partnership is the Bank Group's overall

outreach The pace at which reforms can be implemented is significantly affected by public
opinion The onus of informing the public and developing consensus rests with the concerned

India CountryAssistance Strategy

Page20

governments, who need to devise appropriate communication strategies In response to the
issues raised at the CAS consultations (Annex 4), a special effort will be made to extend the
Bank Group's own outreach and to establish continual dialogue with stakeholders This will
be done through wider dissemination of the Bank Group's reports and disclosure of project
documents (especially in local languages), greater engagement with civil society
organizations and opinion makers, and keeping stakeholders of specific projects continually
informed and consulted
PROGRAMMATICAPPROACH

63
In India, the Bank has to think of its support and goals over the longer term, with
change taking place over a period of many years rather than overnight Increasingly,
therefore, the Bank is taking a programmatic approach towards its program in India, be it at
the central level or in the states, and using different instruments depending on the nature and
content of the programs pursued
Programmatic instruments

64
Adaptable program loans (APLs) are particularlywell-suited to the Bank's support
for power sector reforms in the states and were the instruments used in Haryana and Andhra
Pradesh during the last CAS period Giving clients an early indication of the Bank's longterm support for politically challenging reforms proved to be critical in getting the reform
process underway in these states The need to lay out the reform implementation process as
well as the ability to identify milestones ex ante helped forge a closer partnership between the
state governments and the Bank, clarified expectations and maintained an open and
transparent framework for pursuing a very difficult policy agenda The flexibility provided by
the APL, enabling the Bank to pace its assistance with the government's ability to pursue
reforms, and to give assurance of quick support the moment the program is resumed, has
proven to be particularly helpful in Haryana where the program has been stalled following a
change in government
65
With the state-focussed assistance strategy, the Bank is also supporting a complex
array of social and structural reforms in states that are invariably facing severe budgetary
constraints The core program of fiscal and governance reforms is an area for which the
Bank's programmatic approach is best suited reforms take several years to be effective, and
support needs to be flexible and consistent enough to withstand the uncertainties India's
complex political environment generates Moving forward with reforms also requires
assurance of a reasonable degree of financial support over the medium-term Hence, the
Bank's planned use of programmatic structural adjustment loans (PSALs) to the states as

a means of providing predictable performance-basedbudget support and enabling the states
to restore their financial equilibrium while undertaking reforms at the same time
66
A programmatic approach is also effective in community-basedrural development
projects which involve sectoral policy changes as well as a high degree of experimentation
and piloting As explained in the next section (para 102), adopting a programmatic
investment lending approach whereby individual projects are tailored to the particular
circumstances and needs of individual states, learning and adjusting takes places as projects
are implemented, and scaling up is done as successes are identified, has become a
fundamental element of the CAS It will be intensified to support decentralization and
community-baseddevelopment, through a mix of mutually-reinforcinganalytical and project

India CountryAssistance Strategy

Page21

work The scaling up of programs outlined in Box 3, often in collaboration with partners, was
possible only through a programmatic approach
Mainstreaming environmental and social considerations
67
This CAS aims to support the fundamental goals of social development, gender
equity, and environmental protection and improvement not as separate interventions but
by including actions in these areas in a programmaticapproach For example, work in the
environment will stress the environmental determinants of health, and how to tackle them
(para 98), the links between rural poverty and natural resource degradation (para 99), and
the reductions in pollution possible by improved environmental governance (para 78)
Energy-environmentallinkages will continue to be a part of the Bank's support for India's
power sector reform programs (para 84), and will complement work on global environmental
issues (para 60)
68
Given the seriousness of gender inequities in India, the Bank plans to intensify its
efforts to mainstream gender in the coming CAS period The primary means for doing this
remains through education and health interventions with particular targeting for women and
children (paras 95 and 98) Women's empowermentis a prominent component of the Banksupported community-basedprojects, many of which are working with women's groups
(para 102) Gender issues will feature more in non-lendingservices for example, state-level
rural policy reviews can highlight discrimination against women in respect of property rights
Gender-disaggregatedmonitoring and evaluation(M&E) is increasingly used to track
progress in reducing gender inequality, building capacity in government to do the same will
be a natural complement (para 71)
69
A programmatic approach also enables the Bank to strengthen its medium-term
approach to safeguard compliance, a critical, and often controversial, issue in India This is
consistent with the emerging emphasis on strategic (sectoral and regional) environmental and
social assessments, local ownership, consensus-buildingand capacity-developmentamong
the Bank's clients Activities ranging from training to working with interested governments
to developing sectoral environmental or resettlement policies will improve outcomes for all
projects in a particular sector, not just those which happen to be financed by the Bank
Building an effective alliance with governments and other stakeholders for improving
environmental and social outcomes is key for success, and will have much greater impact
than the imposition of any number of compliance conditions in relation to any specific
project
Fiduciary safeguards

70
Fiduciary safeguards also take on an increased importance within a programmatic
approach, as the focus shifts from ring-fencing projects to ensuring sound financial practices
across government A comprehensive national review of procurement practices is being
carried out The first phase, dealing with central government procurement practices, is
complete Its recommendations are now under review, while a second phase assessment is
being carried out for state government procurement practices in Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh,
and Tamil Nadu National and state-level assessments of financial management and
accountability have been initiated Key lessons learnt and recommendations from this
analytical work are summarizedin Annex 6, which also outlines plans for the future
Promotion of transparency in procurement and financial accountability are also key elements
of the Bank's governance work in India

India Country Assistance Strategy

Monitoring

Page 22

and learning

71
For the programmatic approach to succeed, the Bank needs to significantlyenhance
its capacity to monitor intermediate and final outcomes, be they of policy reforms at the state
level or of individual projects, and to improve its work based on what is learnt The
monitoring of individual projects will be strengthened,building on the regional poverty
monitoring and evaluation workshop held in Delhi in June, 2000 The Bank is also assisting
individual states, first Uttar Pradesh and now Karnataka, to establish poverty and social
monitoring systems to track changes in key intermediate and outcome indicators, including
access to public services as well as income and non-income dimensions of poverty The
objective is to build capacity to put more informationabout key poverty outcomes and
variables into the public domain It can then be used in several ways, including to identify
positive as well as adverse consequences of reforms on the poor, to improve performance and
accountability of public sector entities, and to keep the public informed of successes and
difficulties linked to the reform process Box 4 gives an update of the progress made to date
in Uttar Pradesh
Box4: PovertyandSocialMonitoringin Uttar Pradesh
The Governmentof Uttar Pradesh is implementing a 5-year program, the UP Poverty and Social Monitoring
System (UP PSMS), to monitor overall progress at reducing poverty and improving key gender and social
indicators in the state The UP PSMS entails both defining and measuring key performance indicators, and using
the information to inform policy making and enhance transparencyand performance in delivery of core services
The Governmentis not the only stakeholder in the UP PSMS; the system has the longer term objective of keeping
the public informed regarding the impact of policy, reform and spending decisions on the poor
Work on the UP PSMS has been ongoing for nearly a year A core set of gender-and caste-disaggregatedpoverty
outcome indicators was identified and a special poverty module, measuring a wide range of key indicators at the
household level, added to the state sample of the 1999/00 National Sample Survey (NSS) Data from this module
is now available and the UP Government is preparing a report documenting baseline poverty indicators Other
initiatives are also underway, for example, to assess and computerize the extensive base of information available
at the village, block, and district level
The UP PSMS is an important institutional reform Developing greater capacity in government to collect, analyze
and use information to assess and ultimately improve performance will require continuing support.
72
Learning from reform experiments is also important (e g , review of implementation
of power sector reforms in Orissa) The Bank will continue to emphasize monitoring and
evaluation of reforms, particularly fiscal adjustment and governance where, despite
significant variations in the initial conditions, there is tremendous potential for states to learn
from - and indeed challenge - one another The recently held States Reform Forum was a
step in this direction The Bank will also monitor carefully and undertake supporting analytic
work to better understand the impacts of its innovative participatory rural development
projects and alternative delivery mechanisms
73
The success of the Government's poverty reduction strategy as well as of the efficacy
of Bank Group support for that strategy can be judged ultimately by reference to India's
progress towards the International Development Goals (Box 1) The Bank plans to support
the Central Government to better monitor these and related key development outcomes
Given the ongoing debate on poverty measurement, it is not possible to set targets for poverty
reduction for the next few years which would command widespread support Until there is a
greater consensus, the Bank will focus on monitoring progress in terms of intermediate
variables such as GDP growth, agricultural growth, real wages, agricultural productivity and

India Country Assistance Strategy

Page 23

food prices, and will also continue to supportresearch to try to help resolve this important
debate To tackle the more general problem of weaknesses in the statistical system, the
Government of India has established a National Statistical Commission, which is shortly to
submit its first report The Bank expects to resume discussions with the Government on
support for statistical strengtheningand modernization once the Commission has reported
74
Quantitative targets for key human development indicators are easier to derive from
existing baseline data
* Based on the Gol policy on universal elementary enrollment by 2009, India should have
by 2004 (the end of the CAS period)
. achieved 90% enrollment of 6-14 year olds (up from 79% currently)
. and halved the gender gap to 4 5 percentage points
* To be on track to meet its health targets by the IDG target date of 2015, India should
have, by 2004
. reduced under-5 mortality to 80 per 1000 (from 95 today)
. reduced maternal mortality to 400 per 100,0000 live births (from 540 today)
. and increased access to contraceptive services to 64% of eligible couples (up
from 48% today)

III. PROGRAM PRIORITIES
A. STRENGTHENING THE ENABLING ENVIRONMENT FOR
DEVELOPMENT AND GROWTH
75
The Bank Group is committed to supporting achievement of the Ninth Plan goal of
strengtheningthe enabling environment This involves the parallel and complementary tasks
of improving government effectiveness and allowing the private sector to contribute fully to
economic development The Bank Group's strategy focuses, within each of these themes, on
more specific objectives based on its comparative advantage, using the strategic principles
articulated in the previous section
IMPROVINGGOVERNMENTEFFECTIVENESS

76
The Bank Group fully supports the priority the Governmentaccords to fiscal and
governance reforms (paras 29-32) In April 2000, the Bank extended the first adjustment
loan to India after a gap of almost seven years to support Uttar Pradesh' s fiscal and
governance reform programs This initial loan will be followed by similar one-tranche
adjustment loans to other reforming states (e g , Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and possibly
Orissa, in addition to Uttar Pradesh itself) Over the CAS period, adjustment lending of
US$500-900 million a year for fiscal and governancereforms in the context of annual total
lending of US$3 billion is planned
Fiscal reforn

77
The core vehicle for fiscal reform is the development and implementation of
medium-termfiscal frameworks which, by cutting wasteful spending and reversing tax ratio
declines, lead to fiscal sustainabilitywhile protecting and indeed promoting priority social
and infrastructure spending They have now been adopted by several states, including Andhra
Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh (with Bank support), and Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh (with
support from the ADB) Experience confirms that strengtheningthese frameworks is not a
technical matter, but rather an issue of institutionalizingthem into the government's planning
and budgeting process and providing incentives for key stakeholders to adhere to aggregate
targets and to better prioritize spending within these targets Over the coming CAS period,
reforms to better institutionalize public expenditure management will become an increasingly
central aspect of programs that the Bank will support
Govemance Refonn

78
There is a widespread consensus in India, endorsed by Ninth Plan documents, that
fiscal reforms need to be accompaniedby improvementsin governance Since so many of the
sectors suffer from common problems (over-staffing, corruption, poor budgetary
management, lack of public financial accountability, weak monitoring and evaluation), the
Bank plans to address this by supporting state-level comprehensive, inter-sectoral governance
reform programs, particularly in the focus states, through adjustment lending Equally
important, the Bank is integrating these institutional reforms into the design of its sectoral
operations and into its sectoral dialogue to improve service delivery and strengthen

India Country Assistance Strategy

Page 25

government effectiveness on a sector-by-sectorbasis This approach is being taken across the
sectors, from roads to power, and education to health and environment, in the Bank's focus
states - again it is the in-depth engagement allowed for by the focus state strategy which
enables the Bank to follow this ComprehensiveDevelopmentFramework approach
79
While the Bank's main operational focus is at the state level, it will also intensify its
dialogue on the complex fiscal and governance issues facing the central government In this
case, the Bank sees analytical work, technical assistance, and policy dialogue as more
appropriate instruments to support Gol in developing a fiscal deficit reduction strategy The
Bank will need to work concurrently with the central and state governments on a number of
issues such as fiscal federalism and public financial accountability and to support initiatives,
which began almost two years ago, to link the allocation of central resources to reforms and
performance at the state level
80
Analytical work. The agenda for improving government effectiveness is a complex
one, which involves considerable learning by doing The Bank's latest economic report
(SSPR) as well as its state reports all go into fiscal and governance issues in depth However,
there is still need for much more analytical work, and the Bank expects governance to be a
focus of non-lending services in the coming years The Bank will continue with public
expenditure reviews at the state level, and will also complete a national public expenditure
review in the coming CAS period The Bank will also be undertaking institutional
assessments, particularly at the sectoral level, and aims to develop monitorable indicators for
measuring progress in government effectiveness The Bank's analytical work in governance
will also focus on issues of fiduciaryresponsibility, such as procurement and financial
accountability (Annex 6)
Decentralization

81
Strengtheninglocal governmentsto improve service delivery, responsiveness and
accountability has been a priority of the Government since the Constitutional Amendments of
1993 Capacity building of urban local bodies is now the cornerstone of the Bank's urban
sector strategy The Bank has recently completed its first in-depth analysis of rural
decentralization issues While the Bank is still learning its way in this complex area, it can
already identify decentralizationto local governmentsas part of its strategy to ensure that
pro-poor rural initiatives are based on beneficiary consultation, empowerment and
participation (para 102) In the medium term, the Bank will work with interested states,
through both its governance dialogue and its sectoral projects, in three priority areas (i)
clarifying the roles and functions of the three levels of local governments vis-a-vis each other,
line agencies and user groups, (ii) financial devolution and improved local taxation and cost
recovery, and (iii) improved accountability to local constituents
PROMOTINGPRIVATESECTORLED GROWTH

82
As noted in the Ninth Plan, promoting private sector led growth and investment will
be critical for accelerated poverty reduction in India The Bank Group will focus on four
areas covered by the Ninth Plan's strategies in this area (i) availability of high-quality
infrastructure; (ii) creating the conditions for accelerated growth in rural areas, (iii)
promoting competitiveness in industry and services, and (iv) strengthening the financial
sector

India CountryAssistance Strategy

Page26

Availability of high-quality infrastructure
83
The Bank Group's strategy is to help create the necessary conditions for both the
private and public sectors to play their roles efficiently It is widely accepted, for example,
that most investments in India's transport system will have to come from within the public
sector (para 36) This places enormous importance on public sector reform in transport to
improve construction and maintenance efficiency Institutional strengthening, at both the
national and the state level, and reforms to promote transparency, contracting out, and
stakeholderinvolvement, are key to the Bank Group's transport reform program Transport
will be an important component of the Bank program in India, with on average one national
highway, and one to two state transport projects every year There is also scope for private
investment in selected components of the transport network, including ports, airports, toll
roads and bridges Whenever the enabling environment is adequate, IFC will help finance
pioneering investments in these areas
84
The Bank Group will continue its support for power sector reforms, one of the main
components of the earlier CAS (para 47) The Bank Group is increasingly integrating its
fiscal and power analysis and reforms as it becomes clearer that without power sector reforms
no state will be able to devote sufficient resources to the social sectors and other high-priority
areas The Bank is also paying greater attention to power-rurallinkages through analytical
work, which shows how farmers will benefit rather than lose from power sector reforms
Bank loans in power will continue to finance pre-privatization investments to improve
quality, but may also reflect a new emphasis on complementary rural infrastructure
investments to mitigate the cost of power sector reformnson farming communities Over the
coming CAS period, operations are planned to support power sector reforms in Andhra
Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Kamataka In power, IFC's focus is on supporting
pioneering private investments in those states that demonstrate commitment to power sector
reforms, with a high priority on supporting the newly privatized distribution companies that
the reform process will establish IFC will also support captive, co-generation, renewable
energy, energy-efficient power projects and other private projects selling power to third
parties
85
Improved connectivity is essential if the poor are to benefit from technological
change, and to support continued rapid growth of India's IT industry To address the
problems of limited last mile access, poor domestic bandwidth and poor international
bandwidth, EFCwill consider investments in fixed line and cellular telephones, international
gateway operators, and domestic fiber optic backbones IFC and the Bank will support
innovative applications of information and communicationtechnologies to serve the poor
86
Urban water and sanitation is also an area where the private sector has an
important potential role to play, even though the sector is currently even less financially
viable and commercially oriented than the power sector The Bank Group has developed a
new urban water strategy that emphasizes private sector provision, and plans a number of
dissemination and consensus-buildingactivities to help reforming urban bodies identify and
implement private sector solutions In those states or urban centers where reforms are
establishing an enabling environment for a viable and sustainable role for the private sector,
IFC will lend its support to efficient private sector involvement in water supply & sanitation
and solid waste management Beyond urban water, the Bank will support the strengtheningof
municipal urban services through urban reform programs (e g , in Gujarat), and related
financial inter-mediationpackages, and strategies to integrate urban infrastructure into wider

India CountryAssistance Strategy

Page27

financing systems (e g, Community Infrastructure, Andhra Pradesh Urban Poverty and
Karnataka Municipal Capacity Building projects)
87
Disaster management and rehabilitation. India is extremely disaster-prone Since
1975,the total number of people seriouslyaffected by disasters in India has been an average
of about 50 million people per year The November 1999 Orissa super-cyclone and the
January 2001 Gujarat earthquake killed 10,000 and 20,000 people respectively The Bank
was requested to provide assistance on both occasions At the time of finalization of this
CAS, the Bank is working to prepare an assistancepackage in response to the Gujarat
earthquake The core elements of this and similar packages are physical and social
infrastructure,housing rehabilitation and strengtheningof disaster management capacity
Since natural disasters are a major source of vulnerability in India, the Bank is planning work
on strengtheningdisaster management capacity, at both the national and the state level
Accelerating rural growth
88
About 75% of India's poor live in rural areas, and of these about 80% are largely
dependent on agriculture The Bank will continue to support investments and reforms in
rural infrastructure (irrigation, rural roads and markets, drinking water supply and
sanitation), and agricultural support services (technology generation and dissemination) To
meet the growing challenge of sustainable and more equitable use of increasingly scarce
water resources in India, the Bank's support in the water sector (e g, in Rajasthan, Uttar
Pradesh and Karnataka) will be closely linked to institutional reforms, greater user
participation and cost recovery The Bank will also support the Government's increased
emphasis on the holistic development of rain-fed areas, where a large share of the rural poor
reside, using watersheds as the basis and taking a participatory approach (para 102), e g,
Karnataka Watershed and Andhra Pradesh Rural Poverty projects
89
The other requirement for acceleratingrural growth is agricultural deregulation
The Bank's overall analytical work on deregulation of the rural economy is largely complete
and the measures needed to liberalize agricultural input and output markets, for example, are
well known and lie largely, although not exclusively, with the central government The Bank
will continue with its program of research, dialogue and dissemination in this area In
addition, in future, Bank involvement in the rural sector in its focus states will be preceded by
rural policy reviews which will highlight state-specific as well as central government
constraints and remedies in the rural sector, and which will form a basis for dialogue in the
concerned state IFC will explore possibilities to promote the development of competitive and
efficient agricultural markets by investing in key agribusiness activities where the private
sector has so far played a limited role (e g, food supply chains, warehouse industry)
Competitiveness in Industry and Services
90
The Bank Group will work with selected state governmentson deregulation and
improvement of the investment climate, while continuing to engage the central government
through policy dialogue and advice on reforms that fall within its purview (e g, trade
liberalization and deregulation, labor market regulations, entry & exit regulations) The Bank
will also focus on promoting policy and institutional reforms in the area of technical
education to improve the quality of India's pool of technical manpower IFC will assist by
investing in second-tier manufacturing and service companies that are either moving towards
a regional and/or global presence or restructuring and modernizing to become internationally
competitive Many of these companies also need to restructure their finances as, during the

India Country Assistance Strategy

Page 28

years when the local equity markets were inactive, they became over-leveraged In supporting
the financial restructuring of fundamentally viable companies in partnership with local
institutions, IFC will aim to mobilize additional resources from Indian financial markets, thus
creating synergies with its financial market development work Since many companies have
limited capacity to take on foreign currency debt, investments will often be made in local
currency, using guarantees of loans from domestic financial institutions or by providing local
currency loans using swap arrangements EFC's work with these companies will also promote
improved corporate governance and attention to environmental and social sustainability
Financial Sector Development
91
The Bank Group will provide selective support for financial sector development The
Bank will offer analytical advice and possibly technical assistance to government and
regulatory institutions as needed Key imperatives are to improve regulation, supervision and
transparency to cope with the increased private sector role in the sector, improve information
in the system (for example by developing a credit registry), and improve the legal framework
for use of collateral The Bank will also work with the government in selected areas of
capital markets supervision and regulation and improving the pension system
92
EFCwill take the lead on capital market developmentby investing in private banks
and financial institutions and helping them strengthen their capacity to mobilize resources
and extend financial services, by supportingthe use of innovative market instruments, and by
selective credit enhancements to promote market acceptance of longer-term debt IEFC's
ability to assist in the development of the local debt market is constrainedby the large-scale
absorption of savings into government debt and the pattern of institutions holding paper until
maturity, which means that the essential ingredientsfor an active market - a willing buyer
and a willing seller - are not yet present IFC's work in the debt market will therefore be at
the margins, helping to develop the necessary market infrastructure and to introduce new
products such as partial credit guarantees of rupee bond issues It also plans to invest in
housing finance companies and assist in the creation of a secondary mortgage market via
pilot securitization of mortgages IFC will pay particular attention through its financial
market development efforts to promoting greater access to finance by small and medium
enterprises
93
An aspect of the financial sector of particular relevance to the poor is micro-finance
IFC recently made its first investment in India in a commercial micro-financeprovider, and
will continue to focus on micro-finance, helping to develop sustainable commercial
institutions in the under-served sector Two Bank-funded projects have started to help rural
self-help groups (frequently groups of women) to utilize the substantial but often inaccessible
rural banking system The demand-side approach to the reform of rural banking and spread
of micro-financein India is a promising one The Bank will monitor the results closely before
deciding whether to intensify this strategy or change course In urban areas, the Bank is also
helping to develop a pilot project to enhance access to credit for the urban poor and lowincome groups for community infrastructurethrough community-basedfinance institutions

B. SUPPORTING CRITICAL PRO-POOR INTERVENTIONS
94
India's poverty reduction strategy recognizes the importance of government
intervening to ensure that opportunities for improved livelihood are widely available across
the entire spectrum of society, that the security of these livelihoods is promoted and that the

India Country Assistance Strategy

Page 29

constraints that inhibit and exclude people from participating in and sharing the benefits of
developmentare removed The Bank's focus on two areas, promoting education and health,
and supportingpro-poor rural development, reflects their critical importance as well as the
Bank's comparative advantage
PROMOTINGEDUCATIONANDHEALTH FOR ALL
Elementary Education

95
The selective thrust of the Bank's intervention will continue to be to support India's
goal to achieve universal elementary education, with particular focus on improving the
quality of education provided, and giving priority to the poor and disadvantaged, particularly
girls and children in rural areas Reducing the number of out-of-school children will
contribute to the fight against child labor (Box 5)
96
So far, the Bank's main vehicle for achieving these objectives has been the District
Primary Education Program (DPEP) The Bank is now entering a new phase, based on an
agreement with the Government that there is a need to move beyond DPEP, including by
extending support beyond lower primary (for children aged 6-10) to upper primary (for ages
11-14) The extent and scope of Bank assistance in the future for elementary education will
largely depend on reaching agreement with Gol on Bank support for Gol's new mission for
education (para 39) and on the Bank's role in supporting state governments, who are the
main financiers of education in India Support for elementary education is therefore included
in the lending program though the exact content remains to be identified
97
Success in elementary education during the nineties has highlighted important
pressures for change in specific areas of education- urban education (particularly elementary
education for the poorest), private education, secondary education, and integrated child
development interventions that maximize poor children's life chances through education and
provide special assistance to working children The Bank is already supporting analytic work
in some of these areas and is prepared to add to this work in consultation with the
Government IFC is considering investments in private educational enterprises, with a
particular focus on exploiting new information and communication technologies
Box 5: Core Labor Standards in India and Child Labor
India has ratified four of the eight International Labor Organization conventions on core labor standards
The four not ratified concern the freedom of association,the right to organize, and two conventions
concerning child labor Freedom of association is guaranteedunder the Indian Constitution, while the right
of industrial workers to organize is protected under the Trade Unions Act of 1926 Child labor is a serious
problem, though estimates on the number of working children vary - eleven million were recorded in the
1991 census, but many consider this to be an under-estimate Hazardous forms of child labor are illegal
under the Indian Constitution
Increasing efforts are being made by government,civil society and international organizations to combat
child labor On the part of the Bank, the more recent DPEP projects give special options to target working
children, for example, schools with timings convenient to them Looking beyond its education projects, the
Bank is also committed in all its projects to "do no harm" to children via inadvertentlypromoting or even
funding activities involving child labor The Bank is experimentingthrough the Andhra Pradesh District
Poverty Initiatives Project with working with NGOs to bring children out of the work place and into school.

India CountryAssistance Strategy

Page30

Health

98
The Bank's strategy in health is shaped around three objectives (i) to focus on health
issues of priority to the poor, including child health, reproductive health, and communicable
disease control, (ii) to assist in developing the capacity to manage public health programs
effectively, such as in surveillance and food and drug control, and (iii) to aid in developing
more efficient, effective, and sustainable health systems at the state level, that will better
serve the needs of the poor Particular focus will be placed on meeting new health threats
such as HIV/AIDS, through implementationof the second phase of the Bank's support for
India's HIV/AIDS prevention program (para 3) In addition, lessons learned from the large
ongoing health portfolio in India and analytical work also lead to several areas of new
emphasis
* Bank-assisted health efforts will be increasingly decentralized and tied to building state
capacity to manage health systems effectively, and more and more integrated through a
programmatic approach
*

Building on a major piece of sector work on public/private roles in health currently under
completion, as well as on successful public/private partnerships in various Bank-assisted
health projects, the Bank Group will support India in developing health strategies which
focus more than before on the relative strengths of government, local communities,
NGOs and the private sector IFC will also support investments to improve the quality of
private health care services

*

The Bank will pay greater attention to environmental health issues, including water,
sanitation and indoor air pollution, on which important sector work has recently been
done The Bank is now modifying the design of its new water and sanitation projects to
help maximize health benefits, and hopes to pilot cross-sectoral approaches to improving
the health and livelihoods of the poor through concentrating health, infrastructure,
education, and environmental interventions in specific areas

ACCELERATING
PRO-POORRURALDEVELOPMENT

99
The Bank's efforts to support key investments in rural infrastructure and support
services are designed not only to promote more rapid and sustained rural growth (para 88),
but also to directly attack rural poverty and enhance social protection Natural resource
management projects, for example, attack poverty by increasing access to resources (such as
formerly waste and forest lands) by groups of poor and landless - some 100 million poor,
including more than half of India's 70 million tribals, rely on forests as their main source of
livelihood Projects such as the planned community forestry projects in AP and Madhya
Pradesh will also deliver important environmentalgoals, such as land reclamation, forest
regeneration and bio-diversity protection
100
The key question concerning rural development projects is not their potential impact
on poverty, which is enormous, but whether these projects can be successfully delivered by
an ailing public sector The Mid-Term Appraisal of the Ninth Plan has noted the need for
more effective anti-poverty programs (para 41) Given the need for selectivity, the key role
the Bank can play in this huge area, in which government spending dwarves that of the Bank,
is to pilot new approaches, and help scale up those which have proved themselves to be
effective A programmatic approach is thus key This enables the Bank to tailor projects to
the particular circumstances and needs of individual states, learning and adjusting as it goes,

India Country Assistance Strategy

Page 31

and scale up as successes are identified
101
Deepening the rural asset base through rural infrastructure projects is closely linked
to the complementarygoal of strengtheningthe rural safety net Increasing the level of
social protection for India's poor is of critical importance since they are extremely vulnerable
to external shocks, such as droughts, floods and illnesses The provision of assets is itself a
risk-reductionstrategy, as is the development of social capital, and the spread of micro-credit
Besides piloting effective projects that deliver these goals, the Bank also has an active
dialogue on food subsidies, which could be part of an effective safety net, but are currently
large and poorly targeted, and badly in need of reform, both to help liberalize rural grain
markets and to better serve the poor
102 While specific rural development sub-sectors (forestry, watershed, etc) demand
specific solutions, the Bank's work will also be governed by a number of cross-cutting
principles

*

First is the emphasis given to beneficiary involvement and empowerment that is and
will continue to be an integral aspect of the Bank's rural sector projects The Bank is now
moving on to another phase in its participatory work, with the new District Poverty
Initiative Projects (DPIPs) in several states These provide community groups with
greater choice in their selection of investments

*

A second emphasis is the use of non-governmentorganizations and alternative service
delivery providers

*

Institutional reforms and capacity building are critical at both the state and local
government and community levels to promote transparency, reduce establishment costs,
and cut down on corruption

*

Cost recovery. There is a widening consensus that user charges should at least cover
operational costs, but the institutional arrangements are often not in place to translate this
principle into practice A precedent in this regard is being set in Uttar Pradesh, where a
water regulatory authority is being established to set, among other things, irrigation
tariffs

*

Targeting To intensify their pro-poor focus, these rural programs all need to be carefully
targeted both at the poorest areas and, wherever possible, at the most vulnerable groups,
women, scheduled castes and scheduledtribes, and the landless

103
Community-drivendevelopmentin urban areas Although the Bank's main focus
is on rural poverty, it recognizes that urban poverty will become an increasingly important
problem with a higher rate of urban growth and faster expansion of large urban areas
projected for the next decade Most of the Bank's work in urban areas will be focused on
strengtheninglocal urban governments and expanding opportunities for private sector
infrastructure investments Unlike in rural areas, the Bank's work in community-driven
developmentand social protection in urban areas is just starting Other funding agencies have
taken the lead in this regard, especially DFID and UNICEF, and the Bank will closely work
with them The Bank will also learn from the experience of strong urban women's groups in
states such as Kerala and Andhra Pradesh This will include exploring sustainable financing
mechanisms to enhance access of the poor to financial services, including credit for housing
and community infrastructure

February 2001, 73 projects with a commitment of US$12 1 billion, net of cancellations, and
an undisbursed value of US$7 6 billion (Table 4) The disbursement ratio remains low
compared to some of the other large borrowers (e g , it is more than 20% in the case of China,
Mexico and Indonesia), but is increasing and is likely to exceed 18% this fiscal year

Portfolio performance has been average by the Bank's standards of the nineties
Improved portfolio performance in the second half of the nineties is also reflected in the
declining ratio of problem projects, which fell from 20% in FY96 to 7% in FY00 (Table 5)
However, the last year saw a deterioration in quality with the percentage at the start of FY01
rising to 13% This reversal was in part due to serious and unexpected fiscal problems in a
number of states, which led to substantial interruptions in the flow of funds and significant
inaction in filling vacant posts Other persisting problems that have affected project quality
include frequent changes of senior counterpart staff, inability of governments to comply with
covenants related to increased cost recovery, and weak capacity for procurement and
financial management These problems are now being addressed and as of January 1, 2001,
the India portfolio had only 4 (6%) problem projects This improvement needs to be sustained
to confirm the turn-around in portfolio performance

considered at risk, and closer monitoring of supervisionreports and portfolio indicators The
aim is to improve implementationby early identification of problems and timely
restructuring,with cancellation being the measure of last resort Second, to improve future
project performance, design and implementation readiness will be reviewed even more
carefully, with increased attention on mobilization of user groups, up-front institutional
actions, and procurement readiness Finally, to tackle the underlying problems, of which
poor project performance is a symptom,the plan includes broad-based actions jointly with
government on three critical areas
*

Flow of funds innovative approaches include thorough fiscal assessments in focus states
and a pilot trial of direct flow of funds to project entities without routing through state
governments,

*

Staffing project supervision efforts are responding more quickly to restructure project
activities with persistent staffing problerns, while deep-seated institutional personnel
practices are being addressed through broad-baseddialogue on civil service reform, and

*

Procurement time limits on bid validity are being more rigorously monitored to weed out
extreme examples of procurement inefficiency This has been complemented by in-depth
reviews of procurement practices and problems at national and state levels, development
of improvedprocedures, and training

LENDINGPROGRAM

107 Outcomes from the last CAS The last CAS was discussed by the Board in January
1998 and a progress report was reviewed in February 1999 The last CAS set out two lending
scenarios (i) a base case scenario of US$3 billion a year (US$2 1 billion IBRD, US$0 9
billion IDA), driven primarily by the Government'srequest to increase IBRD lending in
support of India's program of accelerated growth and poverty reduction, and (ii) a low case of
US$1 2-2 billion with a 50/50 IBRD/1DAblend, that would have reflected a significant
deterioration in macroeconomic conditions As a consequence of the nuclear tests conducted
by India in May 1998, Board consideration of four projects, for a total of US$1 2 billion of
IBRD/IDA lending was postponed indefinitelyat the request of several Board members, and
with the concurrenceof the Indian authorities Until April 2000, no India project in
infrastructureand energy (other than one for power sector reforms) was approved by the
Board Actual lending over the last three years has therefore averaged only US$780 million
for IBRD and US$870 million for IDA, below the average level for the preceding three years
108 Lending scenarios. Given its poverty and size, India is under-served by the global aid
community, in fact, the overall aid budget to India has been declining in absolute terms
However, a number of bilateral agencies are currently expanding activities in India, in
recognition of India's importance to meeting global poverty targets (UK, Netherlands) DFID
(UK), for example, is planning to at least double disbursementsto India over the next three
years
109 Since the last CAS, there has been increased demand for Bank lending from the new
reforming states and sectors The Indian authorities have recently requested a significant
increase in the Bank program to US$4 billion a year, with US$2 5-2 8 billion IBRD and
US$1 2-1 5 billion IDA Clearly, both demand and need for Bank financing currently far
exceed our maximum possible response level Given the current project pipeline, it is highly
unlikely that more than about US$3 billion I3RD/IDA lending per year will be achieved in
the immediate future For these reasons, and to ensure prudent medium-term exposure

India Country Assistance Strategy

Page 34

management, for the coming CAS period, the same base case lending of US$3 billion per
year (about US$2 15 billion IBRD, US$850 million IDA for FY02-04) is planned as in the
last CAS, as well as low case lending levels of about US$1 5-2 0 billion per year (about
US$1 0-1 5 billion IBRD, and a core IDA program of US$400-500 million) A base case
lending program is attached as Annex B3 The total volume of IBRD/IDA lending in recent
years and during the coming CAS period is presented in Figure 2 The Bank's proposed
response to the recent Gujarat earthquake, currently under preparation (para 87), would be

with power sector reforms, for example, the Bank lending program will automatically shrink

sector, fiscal and governance reforms, are quantified in Table 6, which shows the extent to
which lending will fall if various reforms do not proceed If power reforms do not
materialize, for example, lending will automaticallyfall by US$370 million a year on average
over the next three years, as 5 new policy-based power sector projects get put on hold If, in
addition, fiscal reforms go off track, an additionalUS$700 million of lending will be affected,
as some 7 adjustment loans will have to be put on hold The combined effect would be a
reduction of some US$1 1 billion from the base case scenario, with both IBRD and IDA well
below their base case levels Table 7 below summarizes the base and low case annual
lending scenarios that would result from the application of these state triggers

Global triggers In addition to these self-activatingtriggers, which will automatically
shift India between the base case and the low case, India's fiscal and external situation,
progress in national reforms as well as performance of the portfolio, will also be monitored in
deciding overall lending volumes Key indicators in this regard will include
*

Improvement in the fiscal balance (as indicated by consolidated public sector debt below
85% of GDP, and a decline in the General Government deficit) and absence of serious
external deterioration (as indicated by net international reserves below 50 % of the
money base)

*

Progress in national reforms as indicated by advances in trade (elimination of
quantitative restrictions and reduction in average tariffs), banking (reduction in
government's stake in the stock of public banks), deregulation of the economy (gradual
exemption of the small-scale reservation limit in export-oriented activities, and
deregulation of agriculture),and privatization of public enterprises

*

Maintenance of an acceptable level of portfolio performance percentage of problem
projects not to rise above 15% and disbursement ratio not to fall below 17%

India Country Assistance Strategy

Page 36

113
The self-activating and global triggers highlighted above are of course inter-related
If India is unable to reduce power sector subsidies or advance state-level fiscal reforms, it
will not be possible for the country to sustain improvementsin its basic macro indicators
Successful execution of the Bank Group base case program is thus expected to assist India in
realization of its basic macroeconomic as well as developmentalgoals, even though the
results in terms of macro indicators may only be apparent with a lag Should a case arise in
which the self-activatingtriggers are satisfied, but not the global triggers, then the Bank will
proceed with its support for structural and state reforms, but cut back on the planned lending
for infrastructure projects, especially roads
114
IDA allocation and blend. India's low per capita income of US$440 falls well
below the IDA cut-off of US$885 More importantly, India is clearly central to achievement
of the IDA mission of poverty reduction As Box 1 shows, international goals for poverty
reduction cannot be achieved without significant improvementsin India The current IDA
allocation to India is, however, only about US$850 million a year At about 80 US cents per
capita per year, it compares very poorly with the average of about US$7 6 per capita for most
other IDA recipients, and US$10 for countries with country performance ranked equal to that
of India (i e , ranked in the upper performance quintile) India's use of IDA is directed
towards achievement of the international developmentgoals, mainly for education, health and
anti-povertyor social protection projects, largely in rural areas In the base case, the Bank
will also use about one-third of IDA for blending programmaticadjustment lending to
improve the enabling environment, without which sustained advances in poverty reduction
will be impossible The Bank's work in all of these areas was regarded as satisfactoryby the
recent CAE Finally, to preserve India's creditworthinessand ensure prudent IBRD exposure
management, IBRD lending cannot much exceed US$2 billion A substantial IDA allocation
is therefore crucial to enabling the Bank Group to achieve the base case lending scenario of
US$3 billion A further increase to US$4 billion, as desired by Government of India, would
require an even larger allocation than assumed in this document For these reasons, a
continued level of substantial IDA resources, at least at the current levels, is well justified
115
As shown in Table 6 above, IDA lending will be linked to structural reforms and
unsatisfactoryprogress in reforms will lead to a substantial reduction of IDA lending, though
a core IDA program of about US$400-500 million for the social sectors and direct poverty
alleviation projects is expected to be maintained In the base case, the IBRD/IDA blend will
harden to 70 30, with the absolute IDA volume maintained at the current level
NON-LENDINGSERVICES

Second, in conjunction with lending, to bolster the effectiveness of Bank support - for
example, at the state-level, regular public expenditurereviews and analyses of growth,
poverty, service delivery, financial accountability,etc

*

Third, to promote capacity building and knowledge sharing, in cases where it is
important to open the dialogue on development and poverty reduction challenges, e g, in
poor non-reforming states, or where policy reforms are required without a corresponding
need for financial assistance (e g , financial sector, macroeconomic dialogue with Gol)
The Bank Group will employ various tools to develop and disseminate knowledge from
short pieces of sector work to formal pieces of analyticaland advisory work, technical
assistance,conferences and workshops Workshops and conferences, to be organized in
collaborationwith the World Bank Institute, will be used to facilitate the national debate
on economic reform and to disseminatedomestic and international experience

B. IFC PORTFOLIO AND PROGRAM
117
India is IFC's 5th largest exposure As of January 31, 2001, IFC's held portfolio in
India consisted of investments in 68 companies, with total exposure of US$668 million for
IiFC's own account and US$100 million for B-loan participants The current interest
collection rate on the loan portfolio is 82% Total arrears are currently some US$67 million
Loan loss reserves represent 16% of the disbursed loan portfolio Equity loss reserves
represent 29% of the disbursed equity portfolio This below-averageportfolio quality is due
to the poor performance of four companies in steel and textiles Despite the potential losses
from these four investments, IFC' s overall equity performance in India has been strong, with
unrealized capital gains currently forecast at US$84 million
118
With improvements in the business climate, progress on policy issues, and easing of
the lending restrictions imposed after India's nuclear tests, IFChas begun to reverse the trend
of under-investmentin India On current trends, IFC approvals are expected to total around
US$1 0-1 5 billion over the next three years compared to approximately US$300 million in
the period FY98-00 However, future investment volumes depend upon further progress in
key policy reforms, particularly to open up opportunities for private investment in
infrastructure,and continued liberalization of the investment and trade regime
119
IFC investments will mainly be concentrated in infrastructure, the financial sector
(including wholesaling of funds to SMEs) and mid-size manufacturing and service
companies As IEFC'sexperience in the social sectors builds up, it also plans to invest more in
health and education There is a strong demand for equity, particularly from mid-size
companies and financial institutions where IFC has an important structuring role However,
demand for foreign-currencyloans is limited For this reason, IFC has recently arranged a
first swap facility which will support up to US $300 million of local currency products, and
plans to replicate this facility with other counterparts With these facilities in place, local
currency products are expected to account for a significant proportion of new IFC lending
IFC will also make greater use of guarantee products, which help mobilize resources from
local capital markets, thus contributing both to capital market development and to direct
project financing

C. MIGA PROGRAM
120
At present, MIGA has no exposure in India In an effort to increase MIGA's
exposurein India, and to facilitate potential foreign direct investments, both inwards and
outwards, MIGA conducted an extensive marketing tour of four cities in India in FY2000
This effort will be followed up with more visits in which relevant public and private sector
institutions will be targeted MIGA expects high demand for its guarantee activities once
infrastructure sectors, such as energy, telecommunication,transportation and water, have
been restructured MIGA's per-project limit of up to US$200 million, its ability to syndicate
additional insurance on the private market, as well as providing guarantees against Breach of
Contract, position the Agency very well to facilitate infrastructure investments into India

D. OPERATIONAL DECENTRALIZATION
121
Implementation of the CAS since 1997 has necessitated a major decentralization of
operations In 1997, decentralization of the World Bank India program was initiated by the
transfer of country management to the Delhi office, and the gradual delegation of operational
responsibilities to an expanded team based in Delhi As shown in Table 8 below, there has
been a substantial increase in the lending projects and supervisionprojects handled by
national staff over the last three years This is the result of the hiring of younger national staff
from world class organizations who are more client-focussed, cost-conscious, adaptable, and
have brought in fresh ideas which have resulted in significant changes in the work culture In
terms of diversity, the present male/female ratio in staff level E and above is 2 1 as compared
to a ratio of 6 1 in 1996

A parallel decentralization of operationswas implemented in EFCover the same
period, with the aim to combine IFC's global knowledge with improved understanding of the
local environment and client needs To this end, a regional hub office was opened in Delhi in
1992to serve India, Bangladesh, Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka In 1996, responsibility for
processing and supervision of IFC investments in the region was partly decentralized to the
hub The Regional Director relocated from HQ, and staff numbers and skill profiles were
enhanced through local recruitment, about 40% of EFC'sSouth Asia region staff are now
based in India As a result, there has been a significant increase in the number of projects
which are task managed from the Delhi and Mumbai offices of IFC As against 4 projects in
FY96, projects managed from India have gone up to 16 in FY01

E. RISK MANAGEMENT
POLITICAL ANDPROGRAMRISKS

123
The main risk associated with the CAS is the risk of reform derailment, which could
lead to a growth slowdown Many of the reforms the Bank Group is supporting, especially at
the state level, have short term social costs and are politically controversial (para 47)
Although there is clearly a growing momentum for comprehensive fiscal and sectoral reforms
to address the growing economic and fiscal crisis at the state level that seems irreversible
over the longer term, a return to the competitivepopulism that was the major factor leading to
the current crisis in the short run is not impossible Even if the reform programs continue,
there may be political opposition to the Bank's involvement
124
There are a number of measures which will mitigate these risks The program of
support to the focus states is self-adjustingto this risk substantial lending to the focus states
will continue only as long as the reforms do (para 111) To encourage strong local
ownership and political support, governmentsin reforming states are tabling policy papers
which outline their reform programs for debate and consensus building at the local assembly
before they are proposed to the Bank for support The Bank will advise and support clients to
improve their communication strategies with the general population to gain popular support
for the reforms These mitigating factors notwithstanding,the risk of reform derailment
remains a serious one
125
Success in a few states can also bring about increased disparity among the states, or
within states, which may be unacceptable in the country, especially with its strong tradition of
egalitarianism Consistent with our overarching objective of poverty reduction, the Bank
Group is mitigating this risk by giving priority to the poorer states in our assistance While
this is consistent with the Bank Group's overall objective in the country, it should be
recognized that this element of the strategy increases the risk of poor performance, as many
of the poorest states suffer from the most serious problems of governance and
mismanagement
126
There are also portfolio risks in this CAS period First, there is the risk that the recent
fiscal deterioration will go unchecked,and lead to even worse project disbursement and
performance, even though a program has been initiated to improve the performance of the
portfolio (para 106) Second, the effectiveness of community-basedrural interventions after
project closure remains unproven Do community groups continue to meet, to save, and to
maintain newly-created assets, or is the social capital created quickly dissipated once the flow
of funds dries up? This issue is already the subject of sector work, and it will require more
attention in the coming years Third, projects in India come under very close scrutiny from
civil society (domestic and international) and the media The Bank Group's objective is to
help its clients not only comply with the Bank Group's safeguard directives, but also develop
the necessary regulations and institutions to improve the social and environmental
compliance performance of all projects (para 69) In addition, the Bank Group's
communications strategy aims to improve the information flow about compliance issues, and
to tackle misunderstandings which often arise in respect of contentious projects
127
Finally, the Bank Group faces a common risk in all large countries like India, and
that is the risk of becoming less relevant This is clearly not the situation at present Feedback
indicates that India, at all levels of the government, private sector and civil society, considers

India Country Assistance Strategy

Page 40

the Bank Group to be a major player in the country's effort to reduce poverty But as the
OED's Country Assistance Evaluation concluded, the Bank only played a marginal role in
this important country over much of the past decade, and probably much before that as well
The risk of becoming less relevant remains real Basing the Bank Group's assistance strategy
on the government's own poverty reduction strategyhelps mitigate this risk, as does the use
of extensive consultations in the preparation of this CAS
CREDIT AND EXPOSURE RISKS

128
India's credit risks are fairly small, in spite of its large fiscal deficit This assessment
is based on the experience of the past decade, on the growing consensus to introduce
measures to strengthen the independence of the monetary authority and on the gradual
strengthening of the domestic banking system All of India's governments after 1991 have
been consistent in their efforts at reducing the size of the public sector external debt,
increasing the maturity structure of the external debt, increasing the level of foreign
international reserves (Table 2), and maintaining a relatively flexible management of the
exchange rate As a result, India's external position is strong and most creditworthiness
indicators are trending in the right direction The resilience of India's economic growth and
its external position in the face of both the East Asia crisis and the recent steep oil price hike
suggests that the country is able to absorb external shocks In addition, a draft Fiscal
Responsibility Act is pending, which will increase the independence of the Reserve Bank of
India (RBI) At the same time, the supervisory capacity of the RBI over the banking system
is improving, banking regulation is following international standards and the government's
stake in commercial banking is falling Therefore, it is likely that India's external position
will remain strong and creditworthinesshigh This is consistent with the international capital
markets' perception of India's credit risks; bonds of top grade Indian corporates (which in the
absence of any sovereignpapers serve as sovereignproxy) are trading at spreads over U S
Treasuries close to investment grade bonds
129
The main macroeconomic risk stems from weak political consensus to introduce
expenditure reducing reforms and tax revenue collection increasing measures so as to
gradually reduce the fiscal deficit and curb the increasing trend in the consolidated public
sector debt to GDP ratio If such scenario unfolds, an increase in the average rate of inflation
and a transitory fall in the rate of economic growth is likely However, the probability of a
balance of payments crisis is small Should a scenario of slow pace in structural reform and
continuationof high fiscal deficits occur, the triggers identified in para 111 are
comprehensive enough to allow a reassessment and mitigate possible risks
130
As of December 31, 2000 IBRD exposure to India was US$7 2 billion, its sixth
largest, and 5 9 percent of the total IBRD portfolio Under the base case scenario outlined in
para 109, India's IBRD exposure is projected to increase to US$9 2 billion at end-FY04 and
annual net flows (disbursements less repayment of principals) would average about US$660
million over this period this would reverse the pattern of the last five years of negative net
flows Despite a projected increase in exposure, IBRD debt service as a share of exports of
goods and non-factor services and as a share of total public debt service is projected to
remain within IBRD's prudential guidelines Preferred creditor debt service as a share of
total public debt service is also projected to remain within IBRD's guidelines

Note: The full line illustrates the Base Case (commitmentsfor FY02-06 of about US$2 billion; FY07-09 between
US$1 3 and US$15 billion thereafter) under the assumptions described in Annex 7

131
At the end of the CAS period, IBRD exposure to India would remain well below
IIBRD'ssingle borrower exposure guideline of US$13 5 billion However, to ensure that this
guideline does not become a binding constraint on IBRD assistance to India in the future it
would be necessary to manage exposure carefully Exposure projections show that keeping
IBRD annual commitmentsat about US$2 billion over the period FY02-06 would require a
cutback in commitments thereafter to prevent breaching the exposure guideline For
example, under the scenario shown in Figure 3, IBRD annual commitments would have to be
reduced from US$2 billion in FY06 to US$1 2 billion in FY10 to keep exposure below the
guideline and leave some headroom to assist in the event of a crisis
132
Alternative disbursement and cancellation assumptions were used to produce an
upper and a lower bound (dotted lines in Fig 3) to the base case projection As the dotted
lines indicates,the cutback in lending may not be as severe if disbursements are slower than
projected, or cancellations are larger Conversely, faster disbursements and smaller
cancellations could result in a faster buildup of exposure and require a larger cutback in
lending past FY06 These projections are also sensitive to the composition of adjustment and
investment lending, and to the currency composition of India's IBRD debt Commitments are
also dependent on policy reforms and satisfactoryproject performance During the current
CAS period, Operations and Finance will continuouslymonitor implementation of the
lending program

Listening to India's Poor

Voices of thiePoor, the Bank-sponsored multi-country exercise of listening to the poor, was undertaken in
India by PRAXIS-(Institution for ParticipatoryPractices) in the two states of Bihar and Andhra Pradesh
What follows below highlights a few points from PRAXIS' summary of findings For the full text, see
www.woildbank.orgpoverty
Defining Poverty & Trends
* The poor define well-being primarily using four criteria livelihood security, food security, ownership
characteristics and value/respect in society
* There appear to be improvements in the overall well-being of poor households and individuals, with a
higher concentration of resources in the hands of the better off
Opportunity & Security
* Lack of education and employment opportunities were cited as common causes of poverty in nearly all
villages visited More and more of India's poor see education as an important prerequisite for better
employmentopportunities
* Many respondents cited concerns with the quality and regularity of teaching in public elementary
schools In fact, in nearly all villages surveyed, the key concern raised by poor respondents had to do
with education services provided by the Government
• Health expenditures were cited as a major cause of poverty, and these expenditures kept many of the
poor essentially trapped below the poverty line
* Health services were inaccessible and of low quality in most locations, particularly in remote tribal
areas This explains the popularity of traditional healers and birth attendants in the remote villages
* Single women, in particular widows, were identified to be the most vulnerable people in a community
Empowerment
*
*
*

The interventionsof non-government organizations have made a significant difference to the lives of
the poor in extending services towards meeting basic needs like health, education and savings
Although the government services were recognized as very important, they were criticized as well for
inefficiency
Women who work outside the household are still responsible for looking after their own household and
extensive domestic responsibilities, reaffirming the "double burden" In many of the sites visited, the
level of domestic violence was believed to have decreased over the years

India: Reducing Poverty, Accelerating Development
Social & Structural Policy Review (SSPR)1
Executive Summary
This Report is a pilot in the World Bank's new approach to country economic reports, embodying the
Bank's ComprehensiveDevelopment Framework Experience worldwide indicates that poverty
reduction and sustainabledevelopment require sound macioeconomic policies, open trade relations, and
increases in human and physical capital But sustained development also requires a comprehensive
framework that includes 1) good governance, 2) sound legal. incentive, and regulatory frameworks that
protect property rights, enforce contracts and stimulate competitive markets, 3) a sound financial sector,
adequately regulated and supervised with a basis in internationallyaccepted accounting and auditing
standards, 4) health, education and social services that reach the poor, women and girls effectively,5)
quality infrastructure and public services to promote rural developmentand livable cities, and 6) policies to
promote environmental and human sustainability (J D Wolfensohn, Address to the 1998World Bank-IMF
Annual Meetings)
The World Bank's new approach to economic reports provides a medium-term perspective on these
elements and on the economy's potential vulnerabilities, including those in the short-run Given the
framework's breadth, this Report's coverage is limited to the most important issues In other areas, it
points out directions for further analysis The Report begins with a chapter on reducing poverty - the
yardstick against which development is measured and the World Bank's principal concern It is followed
by a chapter on human development, which is both an indicator of poverty reduction and a way out of
poverty Chapter 3 focuses on the Indian states, which are key actors in human development and
infrastructure provision, as well as in regulation and governance Chapter 4 deals with governanceissues, a
major concern of the World Bank because of its links to poverty reduction and development The next
three chapters deal with ways to increase growth and its poverty reducing content through improvementsin
a) infrastructure, b) the incentive and regulatory framework to encourage efficiency and labor demand - a
key element in poverty reduction, and c) the financial system and corporate governance Chapter 8 deals
with recent developments,the sustainability of growth and ways to reduce vulnerability to macroeconomic
crises that hurt the poor Finally, Chapter 9 provides a brief forecast of India's prospects and summarizes
policies that would accelerate poverty reduction and sustaineddevelopment The Report's discussion of
agriculture (in Chapter 6) - a sector critical for poverty reduction that is still of major importance for the
economy - summarizes the extensive analysis in the World Bank report India Towards Rural
Development and Poverty Reduction The unifying theme for this Report is thus accelerating poverty
reduction and sustained development

Progress and Problems in Poverty Reduction
Steady Progress since Independence. India is an ancient civilization with a proud history It is one of the
world's largest and most heterogeneous countries Prior to Independence, India suffered from frequent,
devastating famines and secular stagnation. Hence, poverty reduction and agriculture were central themes
of India's founding fathers Uplifting the poor and integrating them into the mainstream is a recurrent
theme of India's Five Year Plans Universal access to education is enshrined in the Constitution Indiahas
established a wide array of anti-poverty programs and much of India's thinking on poverty has been
mainstreamed internationally India has successfully eliminated famines and severe epidemics It has
made progress in reducing poverty and in its social indicators, which at the time of Independencein 1947

were among the world's worst Its vibrant democracy and free press have been major factors in these
achievements
Poverty incidence began to decline steadily in the mid-1970s, which roughly coincided with a rise in
growth in GDP and agriculture Since 1980, India's 5 8% p a trend GDP growth is the highest among
large countries outside East Asia Empirical analyses suggest that agricultural growth and human
development were key factors in the decline in poverty across states (Chapter 1) However, the
development strategy of the 1970s and 1980s,based on an extensive system of protection, regulation, and
public sector presence in the economy, and on worsening fiscal deficits in the 1980s,proved unsustainable
Quick Recoveryfromn1991 Crisis. The 1991 balance of payments and fiscal crisis was met by stabilization
and reforms that opened-up the economy, reduced the public sector's role, and liberalized and strengthened
the financial sector over the next few years The policies generated a surprisingly quick recovery and then
an unprecedentedthree consecutive years of 7 7% p a average growth, led by increases in productivity at
the macroeconomic level and a booming private sector The 3 3% p a agricultural growth during the 1990s
has been about the same as in the 1980s and much higher than the declining rate of population growth,
currently estimated at about 1 6% p a (Chapter 8)
Improvement in social indicators, including gender related indicators, has continued in the 1990s For
example, literacy rates continue to rise and infant mortality rates continue to fall. Life expectancy at birth
has increased, as have school enrollments Gaps between male and female access to social services are
diminishing

Sluggish Poverty Reduction in Recent Years. Despite the improvements in human developmentand the
higher GDP growth in the rnid- 1990s, India's household sample surveys suggest that poverty reduction has
been sluggish recently In the early 1990s, poverty worsened following the stabilization(correction) of the
unsustainable policies of the 1980s, a poor harvest and a decline in food availability (Tendulkar) Soon,
poverty began to fall again and by 1993-94 was somewhat below the 1987 level However, from 1993-94
until 1997(the last available survey), improvement has been limited in the rural areas which contain over
70% of the poor Moreover, analysis suggests that the large poor states in the north and east, containing
40% of India's population, have lagged in reducing poverty since the late 1970s (Chapters 1 and 3)
The estimated slowdown in the overall reduction of poverty may merely reflect one of India's many
statistical inconsistencies- the estimates of consumption and foodgrains consumption in the national
accounts suggest much faster consumption growth than the sample surveys, while the surveys suggest little
worsening of distribution The need to improve the consistency and quality of these and other statistics, in
order to provide a firmer basis for policy-making, is a major recommendation of this Report
Despite Achievements, Significant Challenges Ahead. More worrisome is the possibility that growth
became less potent in reducing poverty in the 1990s Further work is needed on this complex issue
Nonetheless, the characteristicsof agricultural growth in the 1990s, the slowdown of growth in the poor
states, and the problems of infrastructure, social services and poverty programs, especially in the poorer
states which are linked to their increasing fiscal problems,poor incentive frameworks and weaknesses in
governance and institutions, are all problems that may explain the lack of progress in reducing rural poverty
(Chapters 1, 2, 3 and 8 Note that statements made regarding individual states or the states' GDP as a
group refer to the old (1980-81 based) GDP accounts, once they are re-based, like national GDP, to the new
(1993-94 based) accounts, the growth rates of states could be different from what the old accounts show,
since the new GDP accounts include a much higher estimate of national agricultural output ).
Agriculture's average growth has remained roughly constant since 1980 according to the new series of
GDP However, productivitygrowth in the sector seems to be slowing, even in the Punjab and Haryana,
where some analysts suggest that environmental issues are a concern Further, agriculturalgrowth in some

India Country Assistance Strategy

Annlex2

of the poorer states seems to have lagged Public spending on agriculture has focused on subsidies,which
lead to inefficiencies and environmental problems and at best have limited impact on poverty The implicit
and explicit subsidies have crowded-out public investment and social spending in Governments' budgets
and substantially worsened the fiscal problems of states While private investment in agriculture has
increased, to some extent this reflects inefficiencies and distortions that are partly related to the subsidies,
such as the purchase of pumps to reach deep aquifers and generator sets to run them when free, low quality
power fails Moreover, the limited growth in agricultural productivitymay also reflect the limited
deregulation, which has left many distortions in the sector For example, the restrictions on domesticand
international agricultural trade contribute to occasional, sharp tlansitory increases in prices, which hurt the
poor (Chapters 3, 6, and 8)
The poorer states have lower GDP growth, not just weak agricultural growth Partly, of course, this reflects
their structure - agriculture is a large percentage of their GDP However, the poor states' lower growth
also reflects differences in initial conditions and state-level policies The poorer states' problemsin
infrastructure,human development, and, in some cases, governance, have limited their ability to take full
advantage of the post-1991 reforms Moreover, catching-up is a problem because of their increasingly
severe fiscal problems - in the late 1980s the states began unsustainableincreases in spending and large
untargeted subsidies (explicit and implicit) that have never been adjusted, which has led to a large, costly
debt build-up Indian states are constitutionally prevented from external borrowing and limited in their
domestic borrowing by the Central Government Nonetheless, several states, including some of the
poorest, now face unsustainable debt service obligations, mainly to the Central Government, which in turn
had borrowed to fund these loans Infrastructure and social spendinghave slowed in most states as a
consequence of the high debt service particularly in the highly indebted and poorer states The states'
problems have worsened in the last two years, with the cascading down of the excessive central public
sector wage settlement of 1997 (Chapters2 and 3)
Institutional weaknesses and governanceissues exacerbate the lack of funds (Chapters 2 and 4) For
example, not only are teacher-pupil ratios very low, teachers' absenteeismis common Numbers working
in employment programs or attending school appear to be much less in surveys than in official statisticsfor example, in 1995-96, the NSS showed gross attendance ratios of 85% versus the Departmentof
Education's gross enrolment ratio of 104% Large fractions of the poverty funds go to administrativecosts
or are diverted, leaving less for the poor For example, a study in UP suggests that under the new, targeted
public distribution system much of the grain that reached the public distribution centers went to the poor,
but that there was a 40% shortfall between off-take and what reached the distribution centers (Kriesel and
Zaidi)
Thus despite its many achievements, India faces significant challenges and needs to take some difficult
political decisions to realize its potential Concerted policy action is needed to lift the more than 300
million poor, 34% of the population and increasingly concentrated in the poorer states, out of poverty
Better and more education and health spending is needed to provide better access for the poor, females, and
other disadvantaged groups and improve basic services across the board For example, major challenges in
reducing poverty and getting India's population ready for the demands of the 215'century, are raisingthe
literacy rate from the current 62% (50% for females), enrolling the over 30 million children, mostly poor,
who are out of school, and increasing the overall average years of quality schooling In addition,
inequalities faced by women in participating fully in the political, legal and economic systemsneed to be
addressed The decline in infrastructurespending needs to be reversed, to increase the rate and spread of
growth and to meet urban needs that will rise as the 73% of the population that still live in rural areas shift
to the cities Improvements at the state-level, particularly improved service delivery in the poorest states,
will be critical in meeting these challenges At the national level, implementation of the often discussed
second phase of reforms, to complete the external and internal deregulation of goods and factor markets,
will speed the growth of better paying jobs

The East Asian countries, despite the recent crisis, still have a much lower poverty incidence and better
social indicators than India For example, Indonesia, which in the mid-1960s had a similar per capita
income to India and which was the hardest hit by the East Asian crisis, has a literacy rate of 80% and less
than 20% of its population were below the poverty line in 1998 (World Bank 1999a) Moreover, except for
Indonesia, the crisis countries are rebounding surprisingly rapidly, reflecting their strong underlying base of
infrastructure and human development
Potential Problems in Accelerating Poverty Reduction,Sustaining Growth
The East Asian experience of the 1970s and 1980s, and the differential experience of India's states, suggest
that India needs to get back to a higher growth path, which is also more effective at reducing poverty
through improved public spending and a strengthening of incentives,institutions and governance,
particularly in the poorer states To make a significant dent in poverty, growth needs to be at least
maintained in India's high growth states and increased significantlyin the poorer states
India's Future Growth and Poverty Reduction. India's growth of 6% in 1998-99 was one of world's best
However, it mainly reflected good harvests, all major non-agriculturalsectors grew less than in 1997-98
when overall GDP growth was 5% The reversion back to the average post-1980 growth trend during the
last two years may partly reflect a sluggishness related to the shake-out of excess capacity and partly the
slowing world economy However, another important factor in slowing growth is probably the slowing of
reforms, along with a worsening of the fiscal deficit and rises in tariffs - reforms that had earlier
contributed to higher productivity, a higher share of world trade, and rapid growth (Chapters 6 and 8 and
Annex 8 1) Also, the delivery of social services and anti-povertyprograms, necessary to include India's
poor in the growth process and largely a state function, would have benefited not only from higher funding
but improved institutionsand governance
Indeed these and other issues raised above raise concems about maintaining even the current pace of
development Current rates of investment have supported GDP growth 5-6% p a in the last two years, but
can continue to do so provided the productivity of resources continues to increase in the macroeconomic
sense However, the deterioration of infrastructure (Chapter 5), the slower pace of reforms (Chapters 6, 8)
and the resulting uncertainty for investors, the lack of agriculturalderegulation (Chapter 6), the still-low
indicators of human development, and the governance and institutional issues, particularly in the social
sectors (Chapters 2, 4), all pose potential problems for the growth of productivity in an economy-wide
sense
Large Central and State Deficits, related to Large Explicit and Implicit Subsidies. Another major issue
for sustained development is the large General Government (consolidated Central and State) deficit
India's fiscal deficit has been among the world's largest and in 1998-99 it deteriorated by roughly 2% of
GDP The consolidated public sector deficit of 9 6% of GDP in 1998-99 was not much lower than the peak
of 10 9% registered in the crisis year of 1990-91 The Center's deficit deteriorated by 0 8% of GDP to
6 5% of GDP in 1998-99(including net loans to the states) and was far higher than the 5 3% budgeted
figure (all figures exclude disinvestment revenues) The current (revenue) deficit increased to 4% of GDP,
the highest in the decade, meaning India is increasingly borrowing to finance current expenditure
Meanwhile, the states' combined deficit rose to 4 2% of GDP, the worst deficit ever of the states (Chapter
8) Reflecting the recent fiscal deterioration, the ratio of Central Government debt to GDP, which fell in
the mid-1990s, has now risen to about 60% of GDP, and has led to comment from the RBI (Report on
Currency and Finance 1998-99, pp V-12 to V-17) The large and rising fiscal deficit and the large public
sector debt (mostly internal) raises investors' concerns about macroeconomic instability and inflation
(which would hurt the poor), and crowds-out private credit in the banking system

The 1999-2000Union Budget projected a cut in the central deficit of 0 9% of GDP Achieving this target
depends on a substantial rise in tax revenue, and containing revenue expenditure growth to only 9%
Preliminary data from the first seven months of 1999-2000 suggest taxes are growing slower than projected
and expenditurefaster, partly because of support for and lending to the states to finance their high deficits
The Union Budget also changed the accountingtreatment of the growing small saving funding of the states
deficit from a Central Government loan to an item in the "National Small Savings Fund" in the Center's
Public Accounts This accounting change reduces the Center's deficit figures by about 1 3% of GDP but
leaves the (consolidated) General Governmentfiscal deficit unchanged It will be important to pay close
attention to the policy on small savings,as the Center sets the rates and implicitly guarantees the deposits
A positive fiscal development was the sharp upward adjustment of domesticdiesel prices in October 1999,
an attempt to correct for the potential deficit in the oil pool, it also maintained the liberalization of the
sector The states' and the Public Enterprises'deficits are likely to suffer continued pressure from the
cascading effect of the excessive central wage settlement of 1997 on wages and pensions As noted, the
interest costs of the debt have increasinglycrowded-out infrastructure, maintenance, and social spending in
central and state budgets
Implicit and explicit subsidies at the Center and, especially, the state levels are a major factor in the deficit
The Ministry of Finance estimated these subsidies at over 14% of GDP in 1994-95 In addition to
increasing the deficit, they are distortionary,non-transparent, and at best have uncertain equity
consequences, at worst they are anti-equity While the states are directly responsible for many of the
subsidies, the Center's funding of the states supports them indirectly Another structural factor in the deficit
is the tax system, with central taxes declining by over 1 5% of GDP over 1991-98 The growing services
sector is inadequately taxed and agriculture, part of the state tax base, remains outside the system The tax
base has been widened recently, but nonetheless remains fairly narrow, with under 15 million tax payers
As various experts have noted, the approach to sharing of taxation revenues, the lack of a full fledged VAT
(including services), and the failure of the states to tax agriculture have complicated fiscal decentralization
and generated tax-based inefficiencies (Chapters 3 and 4) Expenditure management and efficiency could
be improved, as recognized in the last two finance ministers' calls for an Expenditure Reforms
Commission The civil service is large Many public enterprises continue to operate at low efficiency in
areas where the private sector could function more effectively and generate more taxable revenues
Comfortable BOP but Domestic Policies Continue to Constrain Competitiveness. In contrast to the fiscal
situation, India's balance of payments (BOP) remains comfortable In 1998-99, the balance of payments
strengthened substantially, with the current account deficit improving to 1% of GDP This improvement
reflected the low oil prices that prevailed for much of the year and a $4 billion drop in non-customs imports
that reduced imports by over 7% However exports also declined, by 4% in dollar terms, reflecting not
only weak markets but a loss of share of world markets for the second consecutive year Regarding the
capital account, the Resurgent India Bond raised $4 2 billion despite the turmoil in international markets
However, foreign direct investment declined and portfolio flows turned negative The net impact of these
developments was a rise of about $3 9 billion in international reserves (including SDRs and IMF reserves
but not gold), to a comfortable end-fiscal year level of $30 2 billion (7 6 months of imports, and
comfortably larger than potential short term claims) The projection for 1999-2000 is a slight wideningof
the current account deficit, to 1 4% of GDP, reflecting continued high oil prices On the capital account,
increases in portfolio investment (despitethe continued low levels of private capital flows worldwide) and
"other" capital inflows which appear strong thus far in 1999, will offset a decline in net long-term
borrowings after the one-time Resurgent India Bond issue in 1998-99 These inflows will finance much of
the larger deficit and permit some increase in reserves, although the reserve cover is likely to decline
marginally to 7 2 months of imports (Chapters8 and 9) The external debt situation remains comfortable,
and the external debt to GDP ratio as well as the debt to current receipts ratio have fallen steadily since
1992-93 A large proportion of external debt is to multilateral and bilateral lenders and/or is long-term
Careful monitoring by the Government and changes in the underlying economic factors have led to a

hIdia Country Assistance Strategy

Anttzev2
Page 6 of10

substantialfall in short-term debt, from over $8 5 billion (10% of external debt) in 1991 to an estimated
$4 3 billion (4 4%) in March 1999
The fundamentals of India's slow export growth lie in the lack of further tariff reform, high infrastructure
and transactions costs, and continued domestic regulations such as small-scale sector reservation and labor
laws that reduce India's comparative advantage in labor intensive products and, consequently, the demand
for labor As a result, India may find it difficult to take advantage of the next upsurge in world trade and
the international agreement to phase out textile and garment quotas by 2005, and is not well-preparedfor
greater competition that will arise from the elimination of remaining quantitative restrictions on imports no
later than April 2001 (of which half, mainly the special import license restrictions, are due to go by April
2000) Indeed, India already faces growing competition from a recoveiing East Asia A bright spot in the
current account is the rapid growth of computer service exports, which do not suffer from the anti-export
biases mentioned above, but even they may be hurt if telecom infrastructurelags
Financial System Remains a Concernz.The public sector-dominatedfinancial system is another major
issue impinging on sustained growth and, indirectly, poverty reduction The financial sector mobilizes
substantial resources but still invests a large part of them in the government debt, in the case of banks about
40% of deposits This pattern of asset holding by the financial sector does reduce India's susceptibility to
financial crises but it also reduces credit availability to the private sector From a macro-economic
standpoint, these large holdings levels of debt are simply the reflection of the long history of high fiscal
deficits and the need for someone to hold the resulting debt, funds can be made available to the private
sector at reasonable cost only as the public debt declines relative to GDP A second factor raising the cost
of private sector credit is non-performingassets Non-performing assets are a low fraction of total bank
assets (3% net of provisions) or GDP (under 2%), but are large relative to lending to the private sector (or
to bank capital) The large NPAs in turn require large provisions, another factor pushing up real lending
rates Regulation and supervision have improved substantially since the 1980s and are largely up to
international standards, but they remain well below the steady evolution of international best practices The
payments system continues to lag international standards, according to participants in the sector The
capital markets are deep for a low-incomecountry and improvementshave been made - notably the set up
of the electronic National Stock Exchange and the creation of a depository that has reduced transactions
costs by dematerializing an increasingnumber of shares Nonetheless, transparency needs improvement,
notably in the activities of the dominant Unit Trust of India and in settlements,to help avoid payments
crises such as hit the Bombay Stock Exchange in June 1998 More fundamentally,accounting, auditing,
and corporate governance also could benefit from improvement to make India a more attractive to domestic
and foreign investors (Chapter 7)
Legal and Environmental Issues. Enforcement of property rights and contracts are increasingly identified
by analysts as critical institutional elements in development Clarity and security of property and land
rights and timely recourse to an efficient legal system are important not only to investors but to sustainable
increases in living standards for the poor Surveys indicate a respect for India's adherence to the rule of
law and the independence and quality of the judiciary However, the appellation "justice delayed is justice
denied" is a critical concern, particularlyfor the poor The enormous case backlog and the legal processes
can delay decisions 10-20 years These delays add to the problems of the poor in obtaining protection from
the legal system All these problems, as well as the bankruptcy and liquidationprocesses, raise credit costs,
increase non-performing assets (Chapters4 and 7), hinder good credit allocation and limit the ability of the
poor to use their limited real assets effectively
Finally, the environmental dimension needs to be kept in mind The Finance Ministry's 1998-99 Economic
Survey farsightedly included a chapter on environment, which points out the disproportionate burden of
environmental and resource degradationon the poor, a concern which this Report shares As noted above,
environmental degradation and unsustainableusage of resources, encouraged by subsidies and unclear

India CounltryAssistance Strategy

property rights, may be a factor in slowing agriculturalgrowth in some states and a limitationon
improvementsin the quality of life generally Often the poor suffer from the environmental problems
associated with unclear allocation of property rights to clean air, water, etc The human sustainabilityof
the cities is threatened by water and air pollution, which partly reflects distortionary pricing and partly lack
of funding for public infrastructure (Chapter 8 and Annex 8 2)
A Second Wave of Reforms to Reduce Poverty Faster
All recent Governments have discussed the need for a second wave of reforms to launch India onto a higher
growth path that reduces poverty faster However, as noted, reforms have slowed, creating some
uncertainty amonginvestors Many excellent suggestions for reform are contained in such reports as the
Hussain Committeeon Small-scale Sector Reservation,the Rakesh Mohan Committee on Infrastructure,
the Tenth Finance Commission on intergovernmentalfinances, the Fifth Pay Commission on downsizing
the civil service, the Tarapore Committee on the capital account and its implications for the
macroeconomic framework, the Narasimham Committees on the financial sector, the Disinvestment
Commission reports, recent Economic Surveys, RBI Annual Reports, and the 1999Export-Import Policy
In addition to these contributions, the comprehensiveframework outlined above may provide some
assistance While a basic consensus on the need for the Second Wave of Reforms has emerged, for
example in the programs of the two major political parties, it needs to be translated into substantive action
Broadly speaking the reforms would be most effective to the extent they reduce the risk of macroeconomic
instability, increase the access of the poor to human development, improve governance and reduce
distortions and improve the demand for labor Poorer states in particular will need to enact these reforms to
overcome the initial lags and accelerate development
Perhaps the most effective, cross-cutting reform would be cuts in the explicit and implicit subsidies
together with privatization in power to raise the current low collections of user charges (that represents a
major part of the implicit subsidies) Cutting the subsidies would cut the fiscal deficit and thereby reduce
risks of macroeconomicinstability and the crowding-outof private borrowers, it would free up public funds
for social and infrastructure spending to help the poor and speed growth, it would encourage private sector
interest in infrastructure,it would reduce distortions and environmental degradation, and it would probably
improve equity (Box 5 2 and Chapter 8) In the petroleum sector, the link that was established between
domestic and international prices with the September 1997 liberalization has been an important factor in
cutting subsidies, and needs to be sustained Another policy to reduce subsidies that could be enhanced
further is the increasinguse of cesses on fuels to fund road infrastructure Obviously, state governments
will play a major part in cutting power and irrigationsubsidies There have been welcome movements
toward reform in some states, including some of the poorer states such as Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Orissa
and UP However, state governments are not always prepared to embark on the reform path In this
context, increasing emphasis on states' performance in Central Government transfers, increasing the
proportion that states borrow directly from markets, and without central guarantees (and reducing State
borrowings from the Center), and limiting the states' ability to ease their hard budget constraint, such as
reducing access to high cost small-savings and limiting guarantees, would provide important incentives for
reform A welcomedevelopment along these lines is the recent use of Memorandums of Understanding to
encourage fiscal discipline between the Ministry of Finance and states that receive extraordinary financing
to ease the impact of the recent hefty pay revision And, issues of links between Center-State finance and
state performance appropriately form part of the Eleventh Finance Commission's terms of reference
Realigning Centraland State Governmentsto focus on core public activities would have high social
payoffs. Basic education and health and infrastructureneed better and more public spending to reduce
poverty and speed growth Withdrawal of Government from non-core activities through faster privatization
(not just sales of minority shares) in manufacturingand service sectors, e g airlines and hotels, and

India Couiirtr Assistance Strategy

Annex 2

increased private sector participation in infrastructure,would permit a downsizing, upgrading and focusing
of Governmentand the civil service on truly public sector activities It would also increase the current low
returns on capital invested in these areas and raise taxable revenues It also is worth noting that the current
lack of attention and investment in these sectors is reducing their salability The improvements in the
budgets from reduced explicit and implicit subsidies and higher taxes from the formerly public enterprises
would permit much needed increases in spendingon infrastructure and basic human development at the
Center and state level At the state-level, the states mentioned above are embarking on much needed
realignments of Government in varying degrees and sectors
Better and more spending on health and education. Faster poverty reduction cannot be accomplished
without improvingthe delivery of health and education services This will involve more effective spending
on elementaryeducation and basic health systems, with better targeting on improvingthe quality and
quantity of services to the poor and with more public funding to address the unfinished agenda The
effectiveness of public education and health services in poverty reduction can be improved by focussing on
meeting consumer needs and the holistic needs of children, realigning the role of the state toward primary
education and health, and making efforts to encourage improvements in and better use of private education
and health services
Governance could be improved in a variety of ways. In the public sector, tax structure and collection, and
expenditure management would benefit from improvement Effective decentralization- including
improvingof state and local institutional capacity and greater "voice", a more efficient sharing of the tax
base across differentlevels of government, and closer links of costs, revenues and service delivery - would
improve governance, outcomes and inclusion of the poor (Chapter 4) This is particularly the case in
primary health and education delivery that impacts heavily on the opportunities for the poor to escape
poverty In this regard, it is worth noting that India's decentralization to the third tier of rural and urban
local bodies already has a firm legal basis in the 73rd and 74t Constitutional Amendments (1992)
Effective decentralization and greater deregulation would help to reduce corruption, a mounting concern of
Central and state governments, as would improvingpublic administration and procedures, incentives and
disincentives, and accountability (Chapter 6) The legal system would benefit from a reduction in delays
and disincentives to frivolous litigation and appeals, which would make legal remedies more accessible to
the poor and help reduce the non-performing assets that burden the financial system and drive up
borrowing costs The state governments also need to enforce property rights and law and order, to provide
an attractive environment for investment
Completion of the deregulation of goods andfactor markets, notably through deregulation of agriculture,
articulation of a time-bound tariff-reduction program, completion of the WTO commitments, and
development of a less negotiated/more rules-basedtreatment of foreign direct investment, would stimulate
poverty reduction through higher, more labor using growth It would also help get India ready to take
advantage of the pickup in the world economy and the increased competition, domestic and international
that is developing Further deregulation of labor markets and the small scale sector would increase the
demand for labor (Chapter 6)
In the financial system, India needs to speed upjudicial resolution of cases and debt recovery and improve
the bankruptcy and liquidation procedures Accounting and auditing and financial system regulation and
supervision, though much improved since the 1980s, need to move much closer to the steadily improving
best international practices, especially as the financial system becomes more privatized and links increase
with the international economy (Chapter 7) The RBI also needs to deal more rapidly with weak banks and
prevent their non-performing assets from increasing Lending to the private sector needs to improve, which
will depend on a reduced fiscal deficit (to reduce crowding out) and better incentives to lend and collect,
including privatization of banks The payments system lags improvements elsewhere in the financial sector
and would benefit from some quick improvements Finally, more transparency , such as making the

India CountryAssistance Strategy

Annex 2

massive Unit Trust of India's activities more transparent, reducing settlement times in the capital market,
and improving accounting,auditing and corporate governance,as laid out in the draft Companies Bill,
1998, would help reduce vulnerabilityand improve the allocation of scarce capital (Chapter 7)
Improved infrastructure provision, both public and private, would help accelerate growth. The currently
inadequate provision of high quality, reliable, and reasonably priced infrastructure services represents a
major barrier to continued growth of the economy and services to the poor, and to the diffusionof the
benefits of liberalization The development of infrastructure needs an effective delineation of
responsibilities between the regulator and the policy-maker,and the creation of independentregulators
within a broader restructuring of the sectors In many sectors, privatization and greater reliance on
competition could improve service delivery in many areas Above all, infrastructure improvementwill
depend on the removal of the implicit and explicit subsidies and a move to remunerative user charges
(Chapter 5)
Circumstances Propitious for Reforms and Acceleration of Growth
Events at the end of 1999 seem favorable to the initiation of the second wave of reforms The Central
Government that took office in October 1999 has already made progress by passing legislation to open up
insurance (the InsuranceRegulatory and Development Authority Bill), liberalizing foreign exchange
regulation (the Foreign Exchange Management Bill), allowing trading in derivatives (the Securities
Contract Regulation (Amendment)Bill), and protecting trade marks (the Trademarks Bill) The
Government enjoys a more comfortable majority than the previous one which will permit it to move
forward more easily on subsidy-cuts(as it demonstrated by implementing a 40% diesel price hike in
October, in spite of pressures for rollback), government realignment, and reform At the state-level,
reforming governments received electoral support and non-reforming governments seem to have lost
support Some of the poorer and most indebted state governments - such as Uttar Pradesh - are embarking
on a path of comprehensive reforms, similar to the economic restructuring launched by the Government of
Andhra Pradesh (that was re-elected in October 1999) These reform efforts are aimed at (a) restructuring
state-level expenditure and improvinggovernance so as to maximize the outcomes achieved by public
spending and private investments in the state, and (b) enhancing the revenue base through tax policy and
administrative reforms and improved cost recovery from publicly provided non-merit goods and services
These developments suggest that the chances of real reform happening are much brighter than they have
been in the past, if these do occur, then, as this Report suggests, growth could accelerate to the 7 5% and
higher levels of the mid 1990s India would then have a real opportunity to reduce poverty substantially in
the new millennium
Issues for Further Analysis
In several places in the Report, gaps in the knowledge base and in country experience have been identified
as issues deserving further analysis and research Work on these and related issues will be importantto
reducing poverty in India
Some of the issues are fundamental and involve cross-cutting work in various areas, and often these are the
most important issues These include:
*

*

improving the delivery of social services to the poor,
the links between growth, poverty reduction, and governance, especially at the state-level,
the nature, causes and cures of urban poverty,

Other issues involve examination and comparison of policy options, based on experience within India and
internationally These include

possible policy paths for deeper restructuring of government at all levels, to help "right-structure and,
as necessary, right-size" the state in India,
decentralizationexperiences that will be most effective in improving the quality and effectiveness of
the decentralizationprocess in the Indian context (including studies of states' devolution of revenue and
taxing powers to local governments to decentralize services),
possible paths to fiscal adjustment at the central and state level, taking into account the linkage between
fiscal deficits, growth, and poverty reduction, and drawing on international experiences,
approaches to corporate restructuring, public and private, and the constraints imposed by the labor
market, drawing on international experience,
possible paths to privatization of banks, while decreasing the vulnerability of the banking system
through regulation and supervision that approaches best practices and improvements in accounting,
auditing and corporate governance,
further ways to strengthen institutions and modalities for delivery and repaymentsof micro-credits and
agricultural loans,
options before India in the next round of trade negotiations,
linkages between trade, growth, employment and education

Finally, as noted in various places in the Report, a key issue for policy-making is improvement in the
quality and consistency of various statistics

Further concentrate new lending in reformingstates.
where an assistance strategy has been agreed with
the state govemment Similarly, sectoral lending
volumes should be linked to agreementson sectorspecific policies and institutional frameworks

Agree Our policy-basedstate focus has already been a core
element of our country assistance strategy The next CAS,
currently under preparation,reaffirms this strategic priority
unambiguously Likewise, our sectoral lending has been
essentially policy-based; lending volumes will continue to
depend on pursuance of reforms in individual sectors.
Agree Gol's Economic Survey for FY2001 will contain for the
first time a separate chapter on gender, which will focus on the
status of women and the extent to which women's empowerment
has translated into budgetarycommitments As part of our state
focus, we encourage the states to establish an extensive poverty
monitoring system to track the impact of reforms on the poor and
we design our state assistance strategies with a view to
improving growth prospects -- hence opportunities for the poor -and increasing the quality and quantity of social spending and
other development spending that benefit the poor Gender
considerations are integral to all our work To promote gender
equality, we are targeting women in several of our social sector
programs (e g, education,health), promoting women's
empowerment through our rural development activities,
particularly communityempowerment, but also increasingly
through our rural policy reviews, for example, to remove
discrimination against women in respect of property rights
Finally, we are using gender-desegregated M&E Howevermore
still remains to be done

2 The Bank should systematically monitor the poverty
and gender impacts of Bank-assistedprojects and
programs It should also assist govemment agencies to do
the same for the overall public expenditure programs

3 The Bank should strengthen aid coordinationon
country assistance strategies and on critical sector
strategies(e g, agriculture and rural development)
Greater coordination would enhance the effectivenessof
extemal assistance, and would enable greater selectivity
in the Bank's own programs

As the CAE notes, most development agencies look to the
Govemment of India and state governments for aid coordination,
as would be expected under a comprehensive development
framework However, we agree with the goal of greater
selectivity, and are increasingly working in partnership with
other aid agencies to follow shared principles and identifyareas
in which the Bank has a comparative advantage and areas in
which we do not.

A Snapshot of the CAS Consultations
It is difficult to do justice to the richness of the observations which emerged from the India CAS
consultations Summaries of individual consultations have been prepared and placed on the India CAS web
site - www worldbank org/indiacas Rather than trying to summarize these summaries here, our aim is
simply to give a flavor of the comments and reactions, as well as an idea of how some of the input we
received has in fact found its way into the CAS The focus here is on some of the cross-cutting issues
raised, rather than the very many interesting and useful comments received on specific projects and sectors
Alignment of Bank with Gol strategy This comment was made repeatedly, and especially in the context
of consideration of the Bank's legitimacy In a vibrant democracy such as India, the Bank's legitimacycan
only derive from its acting in support of Government policies Partly as a result of these comments,we
have made, in this CAS, a strong effort to align our strategy with the Government's Ninth Five Year Plan
and the Mid-Term Appraisal of the same
More transparency refocus state selection Most though not all participants supported the Bank's focus
state strategy (some thought it would punish the country's poorer states) But there was certainly agreement
that the Bank should be more forthcoming as to the criteria by which its focus states are selected We have
tried to respond to that in this CAS
What to do about poor, non-reforming states? Even supporters of a focus-state strategy for the Bank
raised the question of how to provide effective assistance to poor, non-reforming states This question was
particularly acute in the social sectors, where it was felt that assistance should not be withheld to the poor
on account of the poor performance of their government No consensus was reached on this issue
Governance as a priority area Bank involvement in so-called "governance areas" in India is sometimes
seen as overly intrusive But participants at the CAS consultations stressed the need for the Bank to be
active in these areas if its funds were to be put to good use
Project governance It was noted that the Bank preaches good governance, but doesn't necessarily practice
it in the projects it finances Participants reported that these are, at least sometimes, prepared without
adequate consultations, and it can be difficult to get informationabout Bank projects, whether at the
national, state or local level Improving project governance is a challenge taken on in this CAS as part of
our effort to better integrate our projects with our policies
Selectivity? There was often agreementthat the Bank needed to be more selective, but very little
agreement as to which sectors we should focus on In a country as large as India, the best way to achieve
selectivity would seem to be through a focus on a few states There was, however, considerable demand
for the Bank to reenter the urban development sector in a significant manner
Far, but notfar enough, in social, gender, environment In the workshops on these topics, there was a
recognition that the Bank had made progress in these areas, but also impatience that it had not gone far
enough, and sometimes frustration that lip-service and tokenism were masquerading for progress This
CAS responds to the challenge by calling for a mainstreaming of environmental, social and gender
concerns into the overall strategy, rather than their treatment, as in earlier CASs, as add-ons
Transparencyand dissemination The consultations were universally well-attended and warmly
welcomed But there were calls not to treat consultation like a tap which is turned on and off at will, but for
the Bank to be constantly open to outsider opinion There were also complaints that Bank reports, while of
high quality, are difficult to get hold of, even for government officials Improving transparency, including
through better dissemination of our reports, is part of the communication strategy for the coming CAS
period

Examples of Bank Partnershipswith Bilateral and MultilateralAgencies
Power reform: We have been working in a full partnership since 1994 with DFID in what is arguably
India's most important sectoral reform - the privatization of the power sector DFID is an active financier
of reform in three of the states in which we are active, Orissa, AP and Haryana
State reform: Most funding agencies are now following a state-focused approach Joint presence in a
single state provides many opportunities for partnerships, and state govemments are increasingly taking the
lead in bringing funding agencies together
Gender equality: Gender equality is the first of two themes adopted by the UN in India as part of the UN
Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) for the country To operationalize the theme, an Inter
Agency Working Group has been established The group is mainly active in the areas of violence against
women and gender sensitization The Bank and IFAD co-finance the Rural Women's Development and
EmpowermentProject
Decentralization: Decentralization is the second UNDAF theme, and also has its own inter-agency group
The Bank, UNDP, SDC and the Planning Commission co-sponsored a national workshop on
decentralizationin December 2000
Child labor: A third UN inter-agency group spearheads the international effort against child labor in India
This group is chaired by ILO, which takes a leadership role on child labor issues Other UN agencies active
in the group and on child-labor issues include UJNICEF,UNDP, UNIFEM,UNESCO, UNFPAand
UNDCP Current plans of the group center around an advocacy campaign against the worst forms of child
labor The Bank is represented on the group by its child labor focal point
Poverty reduction: We have co-sponsored two conferences on poverty reduction with UNDP The Dutch
Government has also funded Bank research projects to deepen our understanding of poverty in India, for
example, by combining quantitative and qualitative analysis
Infrastructure: The Japanese government has supported our work in infrastructure,by co-financing for
example the 1998Paris conference on private infrastructure opportunities in India, and by co-financing
several large infrastructure projects Both Japanese and British governments plan to support an innovative
project for market-based financing systemsfor community infrastructure for poor and low-income
communities, in partnership with domestic commercial financial institutionsand multilateral development
institutions The Bank and ADB havejust completed a joint road sector strategy paper, that provides a
clear vision for what we are trying to achieve in India and how we are proposing to work together
WatershedDevelopment: The Bank is chairing an inter-agency working group on which Gol is also
represented, to harmonize funding agency guidelines for watershed development
Rural watersupply: The Water and Sanitation Program (WSP), supported by 15 bilateral and multilateral
donors, activelycollaborates with the Bank in developing and supporting sectoral reforms as well as in
knowledge sharing The national sector reforms underway are built upon the pioneering pilot and
demonstrationprojects supported by the Bank, DANIDA, DFID and the Dutch government as well as the
sector work supported by DANIDA and the Bank
Irrigation: The Bank and ADB are pooling resources to assist the state of Madhya Pradesh develop its
water resources management strategy, the implementationof which we may later support
Education: The District Primary Education Program is supported by 5 different funding agencies, all of
whomjointly supervise, with the Governmentof India, a common program
Health: To combat HIV/AIDS, we have partnered with UNAIDS, USAID, DFID, AusAID and CIDA
The anti-leprosy and TB programs are jointly implemented with WHO, DANIDA, and LEP (a group of
internationalNGOs)

Procurement and Financial Management: Fiduciary Issues
The Risks to Bank Funds
I
Significant misuse of Bank funds has not been an identified feature of the investment portfolio in
India Use of mandatory bidding/contractdocuments and oversight at all phases by IBRD/IDA have
brought relatively high discipline into procurement on Bank-financedprojects However, analysis of audit
and procurement compliance in the IBRD/IDA portfolio indicates that there are some outstanding issues.
where improvements are required
*

*
*

*

Delays occur in submission of audit reports for many projects in the IBRD/IDAportfolio, in some
cases leading to discontinuance or suspension of disbursements The main reason for the delays is the
inability of most project entities to prepare the financial accounts in line with requirements of the
external auditors in a timely fashion. or delays in timely completion of the audits Disallowances for
ineligible expenditures are regularlyreported by auditors, requiring recoveries by the Bank Project
audits, which are mostly carried out by staff of the Comptroller & Auditor General of India, have
tended to focus mainly on assessing transactional compliance rather than the adequacy of systems of
internal control Most annual audits have not adequately included assessment of procurement
procedures, nor involved any substantial physical inspection of assets
Government accounting systems have not been structured, through their charts of account, to provide
information in classifications and levels of detail meaningful for IBRD/IDA project management
The major concerns for procurement in the IBRD/IDA portfolio relate to unduly long processing
times, the need to revise the outdated data books in the Irrigation and Public Works Departments which
lead to frequent rejection of bids, the need for preparing a common handbook on standard technical
specifications for equipment procured under Health, Nutrition and Population projects, and the need to
better enforce Bank guidelines for procurement of goods, works and services below prior review
thresholds
Funds flow procedures between the Government of India and the states, and between state governments
and implementing agencies, have been consistently delaying the process of putting project funds in the
hands of implementing agencies The procedures have scattered responsibilities and fragmented
accountability,and have led to cash flow problems and inefficiencies in project financial management

2
Relevant diagnostic work so far completed (a Country Profile of Financial Accountability in FY99,
financial management/governance assessmentsfor the Uttar Pradesh Fiscal Reform and Public Sector
Restructuring Loan/Credit and proposed programmatic structural adjustment loans to Kamataka and
Andhra Pradesh, and the first phase of a Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR)) indicate both
strengths and weaknesses in existing public financial accountability systems at central and state levels
Principal findings from this work include the following
*

The role of the legislatures as principal watchdogs over public finances is well accepted and has a firm
legal basis However, stakeholders within India recognize the need for improved effectiveness in
practice of oversight functions In some states, Public Accounts Committees (PAC) have been
dormant Holding hearings in private and delay in discussions by financial committees of budgets and
audit reports, and lack of an effective system of follow up on corrective actions to address significant
audit findings are areas that have been identified as needing greater attention In UP, there has been
some early progress in this area The PAC, for example, has been revived after a long period of
inactivity, and is now examining current audit reports

Annex 6
Page2of4

The independenceof the Controller & Auditor General (C&AG) from the executive is well established
in a formal sense and the C&AG's mandate is broad However the continued responsibilityof the
C&AG to undertake accounting functions in the states impairs the states' capacity for and ownership of
financial managementand reporting There is also a need to improve audit capacity including in the
area of value for money auditing The C&AG and Bank are discussing the provision of assistance to
undertake capacity assessment and strategy development in FYOI-02 that will involve external as well
as internal stakeholders
The media plays an active role in India in discussionson public financial accountability There are
divergent views within India as to their effectiveness and role, particularly with regard to whether
public accounts committee deliberations should be opened to the media
Many of the sectors within government suffer from common problems (over-staffing, corruption, poor
budgetary management, lack of accountability, weak monitoring and evaluation) Internal control
procedures focus on procedural complianceover transactions, particularly concerningbudget
adherence, but not effective financial and procurement management The ownership of accountability
for effective resource management and reporting within the bureaucracy is not strong
By and large, procurement by central government works satisfactorily if compared to public
procurement in other developing countries The system is not without weaknesses, however Delays in
tender processing,lack of transparency in tendering, lack of adequate bidder appeal mechanisms, poor
quality of tender documents, lack of public procurement laws, and insufficient training of procurement
staff and auditors are areas which need attention
Financial informationon such aspects as public debt, guarantees, loans and investments is reported
with varying quality along with revenues and expenditures at central and state levels Detailed
guidelines for budgeting and monitoring of the use of public funds exist but are not always observed
for lack of enforcement and accountability

Addressing the Risks
3
The response to addressing fiduciary risk in IBRD/IDA investment projects in the India portfolio
has been, in some cases, to "ring fence" project management This includes establishing project accounting
systems operating in parallel with government or entity accounting systems This has occurred primarily to
meet requirements of project implementing agencies to produce, for all new investment operations
appraised since July 1998, project management reports (combining financial, procurement and physical
progress indicators) in the formats currently required under the Loan Administration Change Initiative
(LACI) Mainstream government accounting systems have not been adequate for this purpose
4
Annual financial audits of IBRD/IDA projects have been supplemented in certain cases with
internal audit and technical audit requirements In addition, the Bank has engaged its own staff and
consultants to conduct ex post reviews of (a) procurement below prior review thresholds and (b)
expenditures which have been reimbursed by the Bank on the basis of Statements of Expenditures rather
than full documentation
"Ring fenced" approaches to procurement, accounting, and auditing are not applicable to
programmatic adjustment lending, where general budgetary support is envisaged Fiduciary risk reduction
strategies for these operations require mainstreaming of public financial accountability systems to move to
internationally accepted levels of performance and transparency At the same time, improvements in
mainstream systems can lessen (and eventually eliminate) the requirements for "ring fencing" on
investment projects The emerging programmaticapproach in India provides the Bank with an incentive
and a basis to engage with the central and focus state governments on strengthening their general public
sector procurement,financial management and accountability systems

A fiduciary risk mitigation and capacity building strategy is therefore proposed for FY02-04, which
will substantially increase the level of analytical work and technical assistance by the Bank in this area In
terms of analytical work, the following is proposed
*

Completion in FY02 of the CPAR to extend analysis already completed for central government
procurement functions to selected states (Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh) and central/state
public sector undertakings,
* Completion in FY02 of a first Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) covering key
components of public financial accountability in the central government, public financial accountability
systems in selected focus states where programmaticadjustment lending is cunently underway or
planned, and local government governance/financialaccountability systems in those states where the
Bank will be active at the local government level State Financial AccountabilityAssessments will be
completed for those states where programmaticadjustment loans are being prepared The CFAA work
will be undertakenin partnership with other interesteddonors (DFID, the Netherlands, Canada,
USAID, and ADB have expressed interest in working closely with the Bank on the CFAA work)
* Annual public expenditure work in the focus states will evaluate (i) key expenditure priorities in the
government's budget supported by Bank lending, and (ii) progress in strengtheningpublic expenditure
management to better achieve aggregate fiscal discipline, prioritize spending and improve
accountabilityfor the use of fiscal resources
* Increased use of institutional assessments at the sectoral level to mainstream governance concerns in
the design of sectoral operations and strengthengovernment effectiveness on a sector-by-sectorbasis
Examples include institutional assessments in the highway, education and health sectors, examining
accountability arrangements for better performance and service delivery
* Possible inclusion in the CFAA of an analysis of India's private sector accounting and auditing
practices and corporate governance framework, against international benchmarks This will be done in
partnership with IFC and other interestedbilateraVmultilateraldonors and will utilize ROSC
methodology
7
Technical assistance will be provided through sectoral dialogue, as well as provision of IDF and
Bank-administeredtrust fund grants, to build capacity of key public accountability oversight institutions
The Bank will support locally-led efforts to strengthen central and state legislative oversight of public
finances, and public sector audit functions of the Comptroller & Auditor General of India at central and
state levels Technical assistance will also be provided in parallel with programmatic adjustment lending, to
address known weaknesses in budgeting, accounting, reporting and internal control systems
8
Programmatic adjustment operations supporting governance reforms. Fiduciary risk is
credibly mitigated when government-wide systems are reformed to enhance transparency and
accountability for the use of fiscal resources To this end and as discussed in the main text of the CAS,
governance reforms constitute a critical component of our programmatic adjustment loans to the focus
states Among other things, the governance reform programs include measures to (i) strengthen public
financial accountability (e g , establishment of controller's office to lead government's financial
management reforms, reduced lags in government's response to audit reports, placement of monthly
financial accounts on the internet, (ii) enhance transparency and competition in public procurement (e g,
legislation for transparency in tenders and procurement, placement of tender bulletins on the internet), and
(iii) foster greater public oversight through published surveys on corruption, citizen charters and freedom of
information legislation
9
Portfolio Management Activities. We plan an in-depth review, during FYOI-02,of the
implementation of project management reporting requirements, and related computerized accounting
systems This will include identifying, with Gol and central and state implementing agencies (a) the extent
to which mainstream govemment systems can meet project management reporting requirements, (b) the

Aniniex6

scope for applying project investments in financial managementsystems to building long term capacity
within implementing agencies, and (c) interim solutions such as the use of generic project accounting
software across projects, that will reduce the need for specific project investments while government
systems are being reformed and upgraded We will also follow up, during FY01-02, the steps agreed with
GoI to address project funds flow problems, and identify further strategies to streamline disbursement
processing, including electronic submission of withdrawal applications
