EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
i.
Poverty in India: a global challenge. Poverty reduction is not only India's most
compelling challenge, but also a challenge of global significance. According to World Bank
figures, India has some 433 nillion people living on less than US$1 a day, 36% of the total
number of poor in the world. India also has some 20% of the world's out-of-school children.
While most social indicators are improving in India, infant and maternal mortality remain high,
and there are new challenges too, including a resurgence of tuberculosis and the spread of
HIV/AIDS which, if unchecked, could become a major threat to India's future.
ii.
India's Poverty Reduction Strategy. India's strategy for poverty reduction, the
fundamental elements of which are contained in the Ninth Five-Year Plan and its Mid-Term
Appraisal, sets the pursuit of growth with social justice and equity as its basic objective. To
achieve this goal, the Plan's strategy is articulated along two main directions:
*

First, it calls on the state to depart from its traditional role "of being a pervasive controller of
private sector activity, and also a direct producer through public sector enterprises" to one
aimed at "enabling [the] private sector to reach its full potential." To improve the enabling
environment, the strategy calls for greater public and private investment in infrastructure, the
restoration of fiscal balance, and continued liberalization,especially in agriculture, foreign
trade, and financial markets.

*

Second, the Plan emphasizes that "what is involved is not so much a reduction in the role of
the state as a reorientation." Three "areas of special importance for state interventions" are
highlighted: provision for all of basic minimum services, such as education and health;
generation of productive employment; and restoration of regional balance. In both of the
latter two areas, the Plan acknowledges the primary importance of rural development and
public investment in agriculture.

iii. In addition, the Plan reflects the increasing importance of the states in complementing the
role of the central government in the implementation of the poverty reduction strategy. India's
Constitution grants considerable power to the states in terms of regulatory oversight, tax and
expenditure assignments, provision of infrastructure, and provision of social services. Before the
1990s, states' discretion in policy making was limited by the dominance of national political
parties and central planning. The changes in the 1990shave made the quality of a state's own
economic and social management a much more important determinant of its growth and social
performance. The Ninth Plan explicitly recognizes the importance of state-level reform, and
envisages "healthy competition among the states for evolving efficient and socially desirable
policies."
iv.
Bank Group Strategy.' The Group's strategybuilds not only on the Government's poverty
reduction strategy, but also on the Bank's past programs and extensive analytical work
unidertakenon poverty in India. Comparison of the findings from this work and the
Government's diagnosis and strategy reveals a high level of shared understanding with respect to
both the constraints to poverty reduction and the measures required to relax these constraints. A
recurring theme of both Bank analytical work and Plan documents is the need to accelerate the
pace of reform. The primary challenge for the Bank Group, therefore, is one of providing
incentives for reformn,and assisting with implementation.

Strategic Principles. The strategy follows three core strategic principles:

•

Selectivity is vital in a country as large and as full of potential as India. As in the previous
CAS, Bank assistance will continue to be focussed on poorer states that are implementing
wide-ranging reform programs. This allows for a CDF approach to be taken to promote
growth and accelerate poverty reduction, based on a deeper understanding of the state's
specific social, political and economic position as well as a wide-ranging and high-level
partnership. In other states, support will be provided to those sectors implementing reforms
while in the poorest but non-reforming states, policy dialogue and capacity building will be
more effective interventions than lending.

*

The Bank's state focus is balanced by a strong but selective program of support to the central
government for national issues, involving both lending and non-lending services. Four
important areas of focus at the central government level are: agriculture and rural
development, fiscal and governance reform, financial sector development, and health sector
reforms. There are important complementarities between state and central work. Many issues
are being pursued at both levels, using a dual-track approach, from financial accountability,
to procurement, to private participation in infrastructure. Moreover, the Bank's program in
any state is pursued with the approval and participation of the Government of India; the
comprehensive reform agenda the Bank supports in the focus states, for instance, is based on
that proposed by the Government of India for states to follow.

*

Partnerships. To use the Bank Group's limited resources in a catalytic manner, strong
partnerships are needed with our clients and other donors and stake-holders, based on a
shared vision and principles. The Government of India is of course the Bank's principal
partner, but additional partnerships are pursued with its support. IFC has important
partnerships with a number of Indian financial institutions. Partnerships at the state level are
particularly important, not only with the concerned state government, but also with other
donors - most of whom are now adopting a state focus. Scaling up is another important
aspect of partnership: the Bank can scale up smaller donor-backed initiatives, while the
lessons learnt from state-level work can be used by Government of India in formulating its
national policies, and scaled up by the Government to other states.

X

A programunaticapproach. The significant policy agenda contained in this strategy as well
as the experimental nature of some of the Bank's pro-poor rural development initiatives
require a long-term perspective. The Bank's strategy therefore increasingly takes a
programmatic approach, matching instruments to the nature and content of the programs
pursued. This programmatic approach also enables the Bank to better mainstream social,
gender and environmental considerations into the program. But it is demanding, and will
require increased focus on fiduciary safeguards, and monitoring and learning over the CAS
period.

vi.
The Bank Group's program priorities are defined around the Ninth Plan themes of
strengthening the enabling environment for development and sustainable growth and supporting
critical interventions of special benefit to the poor and disadvantaged.
vii. Strengthening the Enabling Environmentfor Development and Growth involves the
parallel and complementary tasks of improving government effectiveness and enabling the
private sector to contribute fully to economic development.
*

Improving government effectiveness. India's deteriorating fiscal position warrants an
increased emphasis on fiscal reform. There is also now a widespread consensus in India that
fiscal reforms need to be accompanied by improvements in governance to tackle endemic
problems such as over-staffing, corruption, and poor budgetary management. From the

-

iii

-

vantage of selectivity, it is in the focus states that the Bank has the relationship and depth of
engagement necessary to be most effective in this core reform area. Fiscal and governance
reforms take several years to be effective, and the Bank's support needs to be flexible and
consistent enough to withstand the uncertainties that India's complex political environment
generates. Moving forward with reforms also requires assurance of a reasonable degree of
financial support over the medium term. Hence the Bank's planned use of programmatic
structural adjustment loans to the states as a means of providing predictable performancebased budget support and enabling the states to restore their financial equilibrium while
undertaking reforms at the same time. Equally important, the Bank is integrating crosscutting governance reforms into the design of sectoral operations and into the Bank's sectoral
dialogue to improve service delivery and strengthen government effectiveness on a sector-bysector basis. The Bank is also strengthening its dialogue with Gol on fiscal and governance
issues, and deepening its analytical base.
Promoting private-sector led growth is the area in which the synergies between the
different parts of the Bank Group can be best realized. Activities in this area will be oriented
towards four main goals: supporting the provision of adequate infrastructure, both through an
expanded role for the private sector and through better public-sector management and
increased funding; accelerating rural growth, through agricultural deregulation and expanded
provision of rural infrastructure; improving competitiveness in industry and services, through
IFC support for restructuring and growth of internationally competitive firms, work on
improving the investment climate at the state level, and dialogue at the national level on
"second-generationreforms"; and selective interventions to support financial sector
development.
viii. Pro-poor Interventions. India's poverty reduction strategy recognizes the importance of
government intervening to ensure that opportunities for improved livelihood are widely available
across the entire spectrum of society, that the security of these livelihoods is promoted and that
the constraints that inhibit and exclude people from participating in and sharing the benefits of
development are removed. The Bank's focus on two areas - promoting education and health for
all, and supporting pro-poor rural development- reflects their critical importance as well as the
Bank's comparative advantage.
*

Promoting Health and Education for All. The Bank Group will continue its strong support
for the social sectors, with a special focus on promoting gender equity. In education, the
successful Bank-Gol partnership in respect of the District Primary Education Program is
approaching a new phase. The Government has decided to replace DPEP with a new,
expanded Education for All program; as a result, Bank support is likely to be extended
beyond lower primary to upper primary. The Bank Group's health work will be increasingly
decentralized and tied to building state capacity, more focused on the relative strengths of
government, local communities, NGOs and the private sector, and will pay greater attention
to environmental health issues.

•

Pro-poor rural development. The Bank's rural projects are designed not only to develop
rural infrastructure, but to directly attack rural poverty, enhance social protection, and protect
the natural resource base for the approximately 75% of India's poor who live in rural areas.
Interventions in this area are designed to be community-based, to target vulnerable groups
(women, scheduled castes and tribes, landless) and to support decentralization to and
empowerment at the local level.

ix. IBRDIIDAProgram. The India portfolio is one of the Bank's largest. Portfolio
performnancein the 1990s has been average, but there are indications of improvement in the
second half of the 1990s, which we plan to sustain through our portfolio improvement strategy.

- Iv -

The EBRD/IDAlending scenarios are unchanged from those in the previous CAS, with a base
case of US$3 billion and a low case of about half that level. The strategy calls for an increasing
use of programmatic adjustment loans to support state reforms, expected to account for about
US$500-900 million a year in the base case. The program is largely self-regulating in that it is
predicated on policy reforms which, if delayed, will automatically shift the program from the base
case to the low case. In addition, monitoring of key macroeconomic and structural variables as
well as portfolio performance will be used to decide on total lending volumes. The current IDA
allocation to India is about US$850 million per year, on a per capita basis much below that which
could be justified by India's poverty and recent performance. The self-regulating nature of the
program, on the other hand, will mean that IDA commitments will only be about half of current
allocations if structural reforms are stalled.
x.
IFC and MIGA. Future investment volumes will depend upon further progress in key
policy reforms, particularly to open up opportunities for private investment in infrastructure, and
continued liberalization of the investment and trade regime. IFC investments will mainly be
concentrated in infrastructure, the financial sector (including wholesaling of funds to small and
medium enterprises) and mid-size manufacturing and service companies. As IFC's experience in
the social sectors builds up, it also plans to invest more in health and education. On current
trends, IFC approvals are expected to total around US$1.0-1.5billion over FY01-03 compared to
approximately US$300 million in the FY98-00 period. Local currency and guarantee products are
expected to account for a significant proportion of new lending. MIGA currently has no India
exposure, but has just concluded a marketing tour, and expects high demand once India's
infrastructure sectors are restructured.
xi. Non-Lending Services will be used to bolster lending effectiveness, to meet due diligence
requirements at both the national and the state level, and to promote capacity building and
knowledge sharing, in cases where it is important to open the dialogue on development and
poverty reduction challenges, e.g., in poor non-reforming states, or where policy reforms are
required without a corresponding need for financial assistance (e.g., financial sector,
macroeconomnicdialogue with Gol).
xii. Benefits and Risks. India today represents a window of opportunity for the Bank Group
and the benefits of this program of support are huge. Without successful poverty reduction in
India, it will be impossible to achieve the International Development Goals. But there are also
many risks, chiefly relating to sustainability- of the reform process, of the country's fiscal
position, and of many of the pro-poor interventions supported by the Bank Group. The
programmatic approach, alignment to India's poverty reduction strategy, the emphasis on
monitoring and learning and the self-regulating nature of the lending program are all intended to
mitigate these risks.

Poverty reduction is India's most compelling challenge, a challenge of global
significance. According to Bank figures (World DevelopmentIndicators 2000), India has
some 433 million people living on less than US$1 a day, twice the number of poor in SubSaharan Africa, and 36% of the total number of poor in the world (Box 1). Estimates based
on India's own official poverty lines indicate that there were 350 million poor living in India
in the mid-1990s. By either standard, poverty remains an enormous problern.

Note: The sourcefor the second column of 2-6 is the India National Family Health Survey (NFHS-2). Figures in
the third column are indicative estimates, which use various sourcesfor global data. The povertyfigures in the

Given the debate on poverty trends in India, thefigures in the first row should be treated with special caution.

2.
Since the First Five Year Plan (1951-1955),India's policy makers have recognized
the massive scale of India's poverty. Over nine Plan periods, India has been able to raise its
growth rate from 2% in the first half of the 1950s to 6% in the last two decades, the highest
outside of East Asia. While this growth has been associated with a significant reduction in
the rate of poverty in the 1970s and 1980s, statistical problems in recent household surveys
make it difficult to know with certainty what happened to poverty in the 1990s. There has in
fact been an intense debate over recent poverty trends in India. The emerging consensus
appears to be that there was some fall in poverty in the 1990s, but the size of the decline is
still unclear.
3.
India's non-income poverty is also of international proportions: 20% of children out
of school in the world are estimated to be in India, and the country accounts for some 20% of
the world's gender gap in elementary education. Most non-income dimensions of well being
are improving. Literacy and school enrollments are rising, and infant mortality is declining,
as are fertility rates. However, infant and matemal mortality remain high, and there are new
challenges too, including a resurgence of tuberculosis and the spread of HIV/AIDS which,
unchecked, could become a major threat to India's future. HIV/AIDS prevalence is about 4
million, up from less than half a million in the early 1990s.
4.
While some gender indicators have improved, with a rapidly declining gender gap in
enrollment and female life expectancy now exceeding male, the overall picture remains one
of stark inequality. The sex ratio declined from 972 females per 1000 males in 1901 to 927
according to the last Census in 1991, though the Ninth Plan targets an improvement to 943 by
2002. Amartya Sen attributes India's serious sex imbalance to "the comparative neglect of
female health and nutrition, especially - but not exclusively - during childhood."
These aggregate indicators hide massive regional variations in terms of both income
and non-income dimensions across India's states, as Table 1 indicates. While the disparities
between states in non-income indicators are declining, albeit slowly, income gaps appear to
be growing. Richer states grew faster over the 1990s, and may also have done better at
reducing poverty.

Well documented in India's development plans and economic literature, the multifaceted nature of poverty in India has been recently brought out by "Voices of the Poor", a
series of interviews with the poor carried out by an Indian NGO, a summary of which is
presented in Annex 1. Interviews with India's poor revealed their vulnerability - to disease,
crop failures, labor market fluctuations, domestic violence,natural disasters, floods and
cyclones - and their ensuing sense of insecurity. All such events hit the poor particularly
hard, and are generally important causes of falling, or falling deeper, into poverty.

India's physical environment is deteriorating in both urban and rural areas. A recent
Bank estimate of annual environmental degradation in India is about 6-8% of GDP. About
40% of this cost is related to the burden of disease due to unsafe water and poor sanitation,
35% due to air pollution, including both indoor and urban air pollution, 15% due to soil
degradation, and 10% due to other forms of degradation of natural resource such as forests
and fisheries. The poor are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of environmental
degradation. More than 20% of urban dwellers live in slums and are grossly over-exposed to
air and water pollution. Conditions are particularly adverse in India's largest cities. The
elderly, children, and the poor suffer disproportionatelyfrom adverse health impacts linked to
pollution and overcrowding. Solutions to India's full range of environmental problems can
only come through the integration of environmental considerations with the overall
developmentand reform process.
B. POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONTEXT

-

A DECADE OF CHANGE

POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS

8.
Greater openness, transparency, and competition have influenced India's political and
economic life in the 1990s. On the political front, notwithstanding occasional religious and
ethnic tensions, the world's largest democracy has continued to accommodate extraordinary
diversity - linguistic, ethnic, religious, regional, and social. Constitutional amendments in
1993 have given legal foundation to local governments, and strengthened participatory
processes at the local level, including a mandatory requirement that one-third of local
representatives be women, and that seats be reserved for the scheduled castes and tribes in
proportion to their population. Electoral processes have become more transparent and rulebound with the Election Commission asserting its autonomy in a more forthright manner. In
the federal government, there has been a consistent growth in the influence of small parties
representing regional or special interests. As a result, no government in the 1990s has
commanded an absolute majority in Parliament, and all governments in this decade have had
to rely on the implicit or explicit support of small parties.
9..
India saw three elections in three years during 1996-99. The election of September
1999 led to a relatively more stable coalition government, its members being elected on the
basis of a common program. The national agenda has thus been able to focus on economnic
and developmental issues, though it continues to be buffeted by occasional political
uncertainty. On balance, this has led to some forward movement on the reform front.
However, expectations of rapid reform have given way to the realization that the pace will
still be gradual because of political costs, coalition politics, and the diversity of opinions
within the country.

ECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS

10.
Economic growth. The reforms introduced in the 1990s have led to large
improvements in economic performance. Growth surged to an unprecedented 7% during
1993-97, and has averaged 6% since. More importantly perhaps, growth in the 1990s was
based on greater openness, negligible current account deficits (around 1% of GDP), high
levels of foreign exchange reserves (US$42 billion as of February 2001), and a significant
increase in the share of private in total investment.
11.
Global integration. India has become much more integrated with the world
economy over the 1990s. Imports and exports have increased their share in GDP by ten
percentage points. On the policy side, quantitative restrictions are being phased out, and will
be eliminated by April 2001, tariffs have declined, and FDI procedures have been streamlined
and liberalized. This progress notwithstanding, India remains one of the most protected
economies in the world. Tariffs were more than halved in the first half of the 1990s (from an
average rate of 128% in 1990-91 to 41% in 1995-96),but have fallen very slowly since and
are still very high by international standards (30% on average). Foreign direct investment,
though higher than in the early 1990s, is still very low compared to other large developing
countries (US$2.5 billion per year compared to US$32 billion in Brazil and nearly US$40
billion in China, in the second half of the 1990s). Attracting substantially higher FDI inflows
will require the government to continue to reduce regulatory restrictions, move on domestic
liberalization, and improve the business environment.
12.
India's private sector now faces twin challenges: to expand its role into areas
formerly in the preserve of government or public enterprises, and to reduce its reliance on
protection and regulation and become internationallycompetitive. The potential of the
private sector in India is nowhere more evident than with respect to information technology
(IT). The IT sector has shown tremendous growth in recent years, with revenues estimated at
US$8 billion in 2000. IT software exports are already worth about US$3 billion compared to
total merchandise exports of US$43 billion, and are growing at 50% a year. In contrast, other
parts of India's private sector reflect the legacy of a long period of heavy regulation and
protection. Many sectors are characterized by excess capacity, but consolidation and
restructuring is made difficult by the closely held nature of most firms, and the weakness of
company balance sheets. Most companies are over-leveraged,with access to equity markets
limited to the very top tier of companies. Similarly,access to bank credit is severely limited
(especially for longer tenors) to all but the top 'blue chip' borrowers.
13.
Agriculture, while never regulated to the extent of industry, still suffers from a
plethora of regulations which are just beginning to be lifted. Growth was about 3% through
the 1990s,similar to that of the 1980s, but below the government's target of 4%. Despite a
slowing-down in food-grain production, India is currently suffering from a glut of grains, and
public storage levels are at some 45 million tonnes, well above buffer requirements, and a
drain on public finances. While terms of trade for agriculture have improved over the 1990s
for agriculture, India is currently suffering from low world prices for most primary
commodities. Meanwhile, the input subsidies agriculture has come to rely on - for fertilizers,
power and water - are unsustainable. Reforming the agricultural sector will be a priority in
the coming years.
14.
Financial sector. Even before the reforms of the 1990s, India had a well-developed
fimancialsystem, well above what would usually be expected of a country at India's level of
development. During the 1990s, with deregulation of interest rates, easing of directed credit,

India: Country Assistance Strategy

Page 5

strengthening of prudential regulation norms and supervisory agencies, and some freeing of
entry, the financial system has become sounder, with lower levels of non-performing assets
and much higher capitalization. There is, nevertheless, a difficult and unfinished agenda,
recently explored by a high level commnittee(the second Narasimham Committee on financial
sector reform), a World Bank sector study on banking, and a joint Bank-IMF Financial Sector
Assessment Program.
15.
India's financial sector mobilizes substantial resources but invests a large part of
them in government debt - about 40% of deposits in the case of banks - well above minimum
statutory requirements. This pattern of asset holding, reflective of India's long history of
large fiscal deficits, reduces India's susceptibility to financial crisis, but also reduces credit
availability to the private sector. Non-performingassets, net of provisions, are a small
fraction of total bank assets (2.7%) or GDP (under 2%), but are large relative to lending to the
private sector and the banks' capital. Regulation and supervision have improved substantially
since the 1980s and are largely up to international standards, but far from best practice. A bill
to reduce government equity in public banks to 33% was tabled in Parliament in December
2000, but has not yet been debated; the Finance Ministry has indicated that the proposal
would not change the essential public sector character of these banks. India's capital markets
are deep for a low-income country, and improvementshave been made to make transactions
more secure, and strengthenminority shareholders' rights, but further reforms to improve
transparency, and develop the long-term debt market are needed. Insurance was recently
reformed to allow new entrants, with mninorityparticipation by foreigners. Judicial
enforcement of loan contracts remains slow, despite attempts at improvement.
16.
Macroeconormicperformance and fiscal deficits. India's macroeconomic
performance over the 1990s has generally been satisfactory(Table 2), and the country
successfullyweathered the East Asia crisis. However, the country's inability to reduce its
fiscal deficits at both the central and state levels has been a persistent problem over the past
two decades. Over the last few years, India's fiscal performance has deteriorated, and the
general government deficit is now at 9.1%, about the same as at the start of the 1990s. The
deterioration has been particularly sharp at the state level (para. 22). India's fiscal deficits are
an obstacle to reducing inflation to international levels, imply higher real interest rates and a
heavy burden of interest payments for the government (which crowds out government
spending in capital formation and in the social sectors), and negatively affect economic
growth.
17.
India's large fiscal deficit poses a serious constraint to monetary policy and debt
management policy. If the deficit is financed mostly by expanding Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) credit to the government, the effect will be higher inflation and pressure for the
depreciation of the Rupee and, eventually, higher nominal interest rates. If the deficit is
financed mostly by borrowing in the domestic market (and monetary policy kept tight), the
effect will be higher real interest rates and crowding out of private sector demand - as
happened in 1999-00. While in the past, government control over the financial sector
allowed borrowing at very low real interest rates, this will no longer be the case in the future
given the gradual liberalization of the financial sector.

Effectively addressing India's fiscal deficits requires a combination of steady

improvement in tax revenue collection, rationalization of government spending and structural
reform to strengthen economic growth. There is an active tax reform agenda under
implementation, with the aim of reversing India's declining tax/GDP ratio. The Expenditure
Reform Commission has recommended various reforms to cut wasteful spending. The Fifth
Pay Commission's recommendations for a steep decline in the staff strength of the civil
service and changes in business processes are now starting to be gradually implemented. In
addition, the tabling of a Fiscal Responsibility Bill in India's Parliament is an important step
to provide legislative backing to greater fiscal discipline, though the impact of this type of
legislation will be limited if the government does not implement effective tax reform and
gradually rationalize public spending. A number of states have produced White Papers to
inform the public of their fiscal predicament, and are following them up with multi-year
medium-termfiscal frameworks to define a path towards fiscal sustainability.

Medium-term prospects and external environment. In the medium term, given
the current rates of growth of the labor force (above 2%), capital stock (about 5.5 %) and
productivity (about 2% per annum), maintaining an average rate of economnicgrowth of 66.5% is feasible for India (Table 3). However, reaching the 7-9% growth target set by the
Ninth Plan for the years after 2002 will require higher investment and, correspondingly,

India: CountryAssistance Strategy

Page 7

higher savings. To attract higher domestic and foreign investment, India has to improve the
quality of the regulatory environment to elimninatedistortions and strengthen competition
domestically and with the rest of the world. To increase the share of domestic savings
available to finance new investment, India has to reduce its large fiscal imbalances - this will
also strengthen macroeconomic stability and attract foreign savings. While the volume of
private international capital flows worldwidehas fallen in recent years from their peak in the
mid-1990s, India's economic prospects and strong external position have kept it an attractive
destination. It will remain so if it stays the course of reform. The recent budget (February
2001) proposes to liberalize agriculture and labor markets, open the trade regime and
deregulate small-scale industries further, reform the pension system, and simplify and
strengthen the tax system. Relatively low interest rates and growing world trade will
continue to be supportive of India's integration in the global economy.
EMERGINGROLE OF THE STATES IN ECONOMICPOLICIES

20.
India is a Union of 28 States and 7 Union Territories. Half of these 28 states are
larger than most countries in the world, with populations in excess of 30 million people
(Table 1). India's Constitution grants considerable power to the states in terms of regulatory
oversight, tax and expenditure assignments, provision of infrastructure, and provision of
social services. The states account for 51% of general government spending (center, states,
and local) and a much higher proportion (75% to over 90%) of public spending on health,
education, and irrigation. Before the 1990s, states' discretion in policy making was limited
by the dominance of national political parties and central planning. The changes in the 1990s
have made the quality of a state's own economic and social management a much more
important determinant of its growth and social performance.
21.
In taking on their new responsibilities, the states have been confronted with the
legacy of several decades of central planning. In particular, they inherited a large stock of
infrastructure - in the form of irrigation, power and water utilities, roads, etc - without
established cost recovery and accountability systems to ensure their financial viability,
maintenance, and expansion over time. The states also inherited overstaffed and poorly
governed public agencies for infrastructure and social service delivery systems.
22.
The result of the above has been serious fiscal problems, high indebtedness, and a
deteriorating composition of expenditure in favor of salaries, pensions and interest, and away
from non-wage operations and maintenance and capital spending. State-level fiscal deficits
have approximately doubled as a percentage of GDP from their level of three years ago, in
large part due to an overly-generous national pay settlement. Many states are now facing a
liquidity crisis, under which they are unable to keep current on their obligations to creditors
and suppliers. The states' resultant inability to step up development spending in health,
education, and infrastructure has emerged as one of the most important constraints to
development in India. Accelerating state reforms is therefore of critical importance.
23.
Structural reforms are required to reduce the role of the state in the economy to
improve state-level finances, and increase accountability, effectiveness, and transparency.
Implementing this agenda has proven much more difficult and time-consuming than anyone
expected. While progress is primarily dependent on reform breakthroughs and turnaround in
individual states, and then on inter-state demonstration and competition effects to increase the
spread and momentum of reform, leadership of the central government will be critical in
accelerating state reforms.

India: Country Assistance Strategy

Page 8

24.
Though adoption of structural reforms at the state level has been slow, several
important sectoral and fiscal reform initiatives have been taken over the last few years.
Perhaps the first was the restructuring and privatization of the power sector in the state of
Orissa, and, starting slightly later, the comprehensive fiscal and sectoral reform program of
the Government of Andhra Pradesh. Other states which have initiated important fiscal,
sectoral and governance reforms include Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh
and Rajasthan.

C. INDIA'S POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY
THE FIVEYEARPLANSANDPOVERTYREDUCTION
STRATEGY
25.
India has developed elaborate consultative and consensus-buildingprocesses for the
formulation of economic and social policies. The Planning Commission, and the Five Year
Plans it produces, have a special role in this process and in articulating the country's poverty
reduction strategy. While a product of the Central Government, the Plans are developed
through wide consultations, including at the National Development Council, the national
forum for central and state governments. India's current strategy for poverty reduction is
articulated in considerable detail in the Ninth Five Year Plan, which covers the period 1997
to 2002, and the Mid-Term Appraisal completed in October 2000. The rest of this section
draws on these two documents in summarizing India's poverty reduction strategy.
GROWTH WITH SOCIAL JUSTICE ANDEQuITY

26.
The overriding objective of India's poverty reduction strategy today is growth with
socialjustice and equity. While projecting public and private investment requirements, the
Plan gives greater priority, in a liberalized environment, to "planningfor policy" and
suggesting the major directions for policy reforms and interventions. Issues related to
governance and institutions are also a theme of the strategy, which envisages greater local
participation to improve the effectiveness of delivery mechanisms for poverty reduction, and
which emphasises the empowerment of women, the poor and local communities.
27.
The Plan's 15-year long-term perspective targets an average annual growth rate of
7.4%, starting with 6.5% for the Ninth Plan period and increasing in successive Plan periods,
with a view to reducing poverty to below 10% of the population over this period. The Plan
targets a current account deficit of 2. 1% of GDP and a combined center-state fiscal deficit of
6.8% of GDP, which is sustainable with inflation of around 7%.
28.
Given the enormous size and complexity of the task at hand, India's poverty
reduction strategy necessarily envisages a multi-pronged approach, which is massive in its
scope. It is not possible to provide a full summary here. The following sections outline three
key elements of India's strategy of particular relevance to the Bank Group program, namely:
(i) promoting faster growth and development by increasing government effectiveness and
private sector development; (ii) increasing the effectiveness of pro-poor interventions; and
(iii) increasing the role of the states in poverty reduction and reforms.
GOVERNMENTEFFECTIVENESSANDPRIVATESECTOR DEVELOPMENT

29.
Fiscal sustainability. The Plan documents note the precariousness of the current
fiscal situation, and recommend corrective measures at both the central and state levels. Tax

India: CountryAssistance Strategy

Page 9

reforms focused on base broadening and improving compliance are intended to halt the
decline in the tax-to-GDP ratio. Tighter expenditure controls are also important, especially in
relation to the wage bill. Subsidies, both explicit subsidies at the central level, such as for
food and fertilizers, and implicit at the state level, such as for power, higher education and
irrigation, will need to be cut.
30.
Improving the quality of governance is emerging as a key element of India's
poverty reduction strategy. In his address to the National Development Council meeting held
on February 19, 1999, the Prime Minister stated: "People often perceive the bureaucracy as
an agent of exploitation rather than a provider of service. Corruption has become a low risk
and high reward activity. Frequent and arbitrary transfers (of government officials)
combined with limited tenures are harming the work ethics and lowering the morale of honest
officers. While expecting discipline and diligencefrom the administration, the political
executive should self-critically review its own performance. Unless we do this, we cannot
regain credibility in the eyes of the people who have elected us to serve them. "
31.
As highlighted in the Plan, the bureaucracy is becoming increasingly subject to
political interference, a phenomenon most manifest in the shrinking average tenure attached
to many government positions, especially at the state level. The judicial system is not
functioning well: currently an estimated 25 million cases are pending in various courts.
Tackling these, and related problems, will require reformnsdealing with the civil service, the
judicial system, anti-corruption strategies, etc., and the active involvement of civil society.
The Mid-Term Appraisal outlines a comprehensive strategy along these lines and highlights
that "administrativeand legal refonns should be an integralpart of the reform agenda. "
32.
One very important developmentover the 1990s is the devolution of responsibilities
to the third-tier or local governments. In the wake of the 73rd and 74th Amendments,
adopted in 1993,many states have developed ambitious plans for decentralization that are at
various stages of implementation. The Plan endorses the move towards decentralization, and
notes that both local governments and user groups have a role to play in enhancing
beneficiary participation and control.
33.
Privatization. Although successive governmentsthrough the 1990s have proclaimed
their commitment to privatization, or disinvestment, the Plan acknowledges that actual
progress made has been very slow. This remains a controversial area of policy, although the
Finance Minister announced last year that government equity in nearly all public enterprises
would be brought down to 26% or less. While some transactions are underway, progress
remains unsatisfactory; the government strategycalls for the process of disinvestment to be
accelerated.
34.
Domestic and external liberalization. Growth in India benefited greatly from the
reduction of industrial investment licensing regulations. However, the business environment
continues to be unpredictable, discretionary and burdensome. The government strategy
recognizes the importance of further domestic liberalization, including: (i) immediate
abolition of small-scale reservations in critical export areas, and phasing-out of reservations
in other areas; (ii) deregulation in labor policy, accompaniedby introduction of
unemployment insurance; (iii) completion of the dismantling of administrative prices (e.g., in
petroleum products); and (iv) reduction of clearance delays and harassment of businesses by
excessive inspection requirements. To continue the liberalization of the external regime
initiated in 1991, the strategy calls for a time frame to be laid down for a phased reduction of
tariffs from their current average level of 30% to an average of 10%.

India: Country Assistance Strategy

Page 10

35.
Agricultural reforms. Attacking rural poverty will require deregulation and more
liberal rural policies as well as an expansion of rural infrastructure to boost agricultural
growth and tackle the problems identified in para. 13. The Ninth Plan thus sets out a multidimensional reform agenda for improving incentives to produce, rationalizing subsidies and
promoting investments, besides extending protective cover to the poor. A review and
elimination of myriad controls in the domestic market for agricultural produce is presented as
an urgent necessity. Other rural development reforms identified pertain to rural credit, land
reforms, and the development of rain-fed areas and exploitation of ground water potential.
Infrastructure bottlenecks. The Plan recognizes that infrastructure bottlenecks
36.
have become a major constraint on growth. Although public investment in infrastructure will
remain central, mobilization of private investment is also important. The Plan recognizes that
private investment has been deterred by the slow pace of policy reforrn, the high degree of
uncertainty over the policy and regulatory frameworks, the unreliability of the legal system to
enforce contracts, and exposure to political interference and corruption. Key infrastructure
sectoral issues include the following:
*

The transport sector is one that the Plan recognizes will continue to rely largely on
public investment. Currently, it is inefficient and under-funded, resulting in growing
congestion and longer delays, all of which push up costs for Indian producers. The
government is moving towards improving road sector management, creating various road
funds at the state and central levels financed by road users through diesel/petrol cess, and
making tangible progress on the proposed "quadrilateral" national highway linking the
four largest cities in the country.
l
Urban
infrastructure. Despite the relative deceleration in India's rate of urbanization
over the last 20 years, the gap between demand and supply of basic urban services has
widened as a result of ineffective management, inadequate funding and poor project
development. Urban water has good potential for private sector participation, but the
basic regulatory framework and commercial orientation is yet to develop.

*

Power sector reform. According to the Government's strategy, "reforms in the energy
sector should start with the restructuring of State Electricity Boards (SEBs). Unbundling
the SEBs and separating generation, transmission and distribution into separate
corporations will make it possible to monitor efficiency levels in each activity and also to
create appropriate incentives for efficiency in each area. Unbundling will also make it
easier to allow private sector operators in each area in a suitable manner. "

37.
Skilled labor. The bottlenecks constraining growth in India also include shortages of
appropriately skilled and trained personnel. Although India has one of the world's largest
stocks of scientists, engineers and technicians, the quality of their training below the first tier
is poor. The Ninth Plan documents give a basic thrust to improving the quality and relevance
of technical education by networking institutions both in government and the private sector,
linking institutions with industry and community better, and developing "centers of
excellence. " The Plan also places emphasis on issues of governance of universities and
colleges, and resource mobilization, including full cost recovery from students who can
afford to pay.
MORE EFFECTIVEPRO-POORINTERVENTIONS

38.

India's poverty reduction strategy is based on the premise that "economic growth and

employment opportunities in themselves may not be sufficient to improve the living conditions

India:CountryAssistanceStrategy

Page11

of the poor. They need to be accompanied by measures which enhance the social and
physical conditions of existence." The Ninth Plan recognizes that, "despite considerable
efforts, provision of social infrastructure and services remain inadequate...Primary
education, primary health care, safe drinking water, nutrition and sanitation require heavy
investment which has to be provided out of public funds....Furthermore, recognizing the
localized nature of these essential services, it is desirable that control over operation and
maintenance of the facilities should be in the hands of peoples' institutions and local
associations."
39.
Education. India's poverty reduction strategy looks at education as "the most vital
and crucial investment in human development, " with elementary education receiving the
highest priority. The Ninth Plan seeks to achieve universal elementary education (age 6-14)
through several measures:
* Amendment of the Constitution to make elementary education afundamental right.
• Decentralization of planning, supervision, and management of education through local
bodies.
* Social mobilization of local communitiesfor adult literacy campaigns andfor
promotion of primary education.
• Stronger partnership with NGOs and voluntary organizations.
• Advocacy and media campaigns.
• Provision of opportunitiesfor non-formal and alternative educationfor out of school
children in the most backward areas andfor unreached segments of the population.
The Cabinet has recently sanctioned the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (Education for All), a
centrally sponsored scheme within which all existing government programs supporting
elementary education will be placed and which will provide substantial additional financial
support to the states.
40.
Health. In the Ninth Plan, the focus is on integrating communicable, noncommunicable and nutrition related health services, through strengthening and better
utilization of existing health care institutions. The Plan aims to minimize the existing
disparities between states and ensure that reforms do not result in deterioration of health
status in poorer segments of the population. Special attention is given to gearing up to
combat the new threat of HIV/AIDS. The National Population Policy 2000 affirms the
government's commitment to gender-sensitivepolicies with a holistic approach to population
and developmentthrough decentralized planning and program implementation. It focuses on
health communication and behavior change, convergence of service delivery at the village
level, meeting the unmet needs for family welfare services, ensuring coverage of the underserved population in urban slums and tribal communities, and increasing collaboration with
the private sector and NGOs.
41.
More effective anti-poverty programs. India spends heavily on anti-poverty
programs in rural areas, but many question the efficiency and efficacy of these expenditures
and their vulnerability to corruption and rent seeking. The Mid-Term Appraisal notes that the
"role of anti-povertyprograms to supplement the growth effort is not only valid in the postreform period but becomes even greater to protect the rural poor against adverse
consequences of economic reforms." However, the government recognizes the need to
restructure such programs for effective implementationand for enhancing the productivity of
the beneficiaries in the rural areas. "A major weakness in the implementation of poverty
alleviation programs has been the lack of participation by the people for whom the programs

India: CountryAssistance Strategy

Page 12

are meant. Strong local governance such as expectedfrom Panchayati Raj Institutions responsive to the needs of beneficiaries, encouraging mobilization of the rural poor and open
to social audit - promises better delivery of poverty alleviation programs.
TEE ROLE OF THE STATES IN POVERTY REDUCTION AND REFORMS

42.
The government's poverty reduction strategy explicitly recognizes the importance of
state-level reform, and envisages "healthy competition among the states for evolving efficient
and socially desirable policies. " It puts forward the concept of "cooperative federalism,"
whereby much greater freedom would be given to states to determine not only their own
priorities but also the modalities of public intervention and provision of goods and services.

Box 2: Reforms in the States
Reforms in the states should consist of the following elements:
1. Tax Reforms: A tax reformprogram which includes rationalization of tax structure is an area of high
priority. It is essential to restore the buoyancy of tax revenues and increase tax /SDP ratios.
2. Expenditure Reform: States must initiate comprehensive expenditure reform programs to reduce
unproductive and wasteful expenditure on one hand and improve the quality of expenditure on the other.
Unwarrantedrapid increases in salaries and subsidies of recent years must be curbed. On the other hand,
capital expenditure and maintenance, which have been experiencing shortfalls, must be protected. Wage bill
of the states needs to be closely monitored.
3. Improvement in Fiscal Administration and Management: Strengthening, streamlining and simplification of
the tax machinery is a must to check tax evasion and promote tax compliance. It will also help to improve the
business environment. Moreover improved management of expenditure will ensure more efficient use of
scarcefunds. This will entail reforms in budgeting, accounting, internal control and audit, cash and debt
management and management information system.
4. Public Sector Enterprises Reform including Disinvestment: Public sector enterprises, in particular the
SEBs [State Electricity Boards] and the SRTCs [State Road Transport Corporations] have proved to be a big
drain on states resources. States must implement reforms to bring these enterprises under professional
management and run them in a commercially viable manner.
5. Power Sector Reforms: Power sector reforms are essential if states are to get back on the path offiscal
sustainability. SEBs are the single most important drain on states' resources. Power tariffs must ensure cost
recovery and the culture of non-payment of dues by customers to public utilities must be curbed.
6. Improved Infrastructure: The state of infrastructure both physical and social, is acting as a drag on growth
in most states. Infrastructure sector callsfor urgent intervention if the growth process is to be accelerated
and statesfinances are to benefit. More efficient management, higher investment and greater cost recovery
would, in general, be required in these areas. User charges for water, transport and other services must be
suitably enhanced.

43.
Unlike the reforms of the early 1990s, what is needed now are reforms at the state as
well as the central government level. The Mid-Term Appraisal sets out a comprehensive
reform program for the states (Box 2). The Plan also calls on the states to be more active in
universalizing primary education, increasing the literacy rate, and improving health
indicators.
IMPLICATIONS OF INDIA'S POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY FOR THE BANK GROUP

44.
Since the last CAS, the Bank has done extensive work on poverty, with the objective
of understanding its social, human and economic dimensions as well as the priority measures
needed to reduce poverty and improve living conditions. A comprehensive Structural and
Social Policy Review (SSPR) completed last year, used poverty reduction as a central and

India: Country Assistance Strategy

Page 13

unifying theme. The Executive Summary of this report, which provides an overview of the
Bank's analysis of the poverty issue in India, is attached as Annex 2. Comparison of the
findings from the Bank's analytical work, including the recent World Development Report on
Poverty (2000/01), and the government's diagnosis and strategy reveals a high-level of shared
understanding with respect to both the constraints to poverty reduction and the measures
required to relax these constraints. In particular, there is broad consensus over the major
challenges facing India today:
* To accelerate growth and widen economic opportunitiesfor the poor, through higher
investments and improved maintenance in key sectors (e.g., in agriculture, infrastructure)
and a better policy environment.
* To expand human capabilities, which means achieving India's goal of education for all,
and significant improvements in health status and security through more effective
provision of basic services at the local level.
* To ensure basic entitlements- food, shelter, safety - for all people, to reduce risk and
provide adequate protection for the vulnerable, destitute, and socially marginalized - in
particular women and children from poor families; and
* To empower India's poorest citizens, by bringing them into the process of decisionmaking at all levels - this requires a public sector that is more effective, transparent, and
accountable to citizens at all levels.
45.
One recurring theme of both the Bank's analytical work and Plan documents is the
need to accelerate the pace of reform. The problem in India is not that the constraints to
poverty reduction are not well understood; the problem is rather that reforms are very
difficult to implement, at both the central government level and, increasingly, at the state
level. Reversing decades of populism and neglect does not come easily. The primary
challenge for the Bank Group is therefore one of providing incentives for reform, and
assisting with implementation. In this regard, the Bank Group can play an important role by
aligning itself to India's national strategy for poverty reduction, and finding areas within
which it can make a significant contribution. Part II of the CAS details the Bank Group's
strategy and program from this perspective.

India: CountryAssistance Strategy

II. THE BANK GROUP'S STRATEGY
A. INPUTSTO STRATEGYFORMULATION
COUNTRY ASSISTANCE EVALUATION

46.
The Bank's program in India over the last ten years has recently been the subject of a
Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE) by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED). The
overall rating of the CAE for the decade is moderately satisfactory. With respect to the last
CAS period (1998-2000), the CAE concludes: "The relevance of the assistance strategy,
however, has improved substantially over the past two years through a more sharpened focus
on poverty reduction, a more selective approach to state assistance and greater attention to
governance and institutions. Although it is too early to gauge its efficacy, recent initiatives
hold strong promise of substantial improvement in performance." The main
2
recommendations of the CAE are the following:
•

To enhance the effectiveness of its assistance, the Bank should: (i) link the overall
lending volumes tofiscal discipline at the federal level and to progress in structural
reforms in agriculture and the implementation of an effective rural development strategy,
as progress in these areas is crucial for rural poverty reduction; and (ii) further
concentrate new lending in reforming states, where an assistance strategy has been
agreed with the state government. Similarly, sectoral lending volumes should be linked
to agreements on sector-specific policies and institutionalframeworks.

*

The Bank should systematically monitor the poverty and gender impacts of Bank-assisted
projects and programs. It should also assist government agencies to do the same for the
overall public expenditure programs.

*

The Bank should strengthen aid coordination on country assistance strategies and on
critical sector strategies (e.g., agriculture and rural development). Greater coordination
would enhance the effectiveness of external assistance, and would enable greater
selectivity in the Bank's own programs.

LESSONSLEARNT FROM THE LAST CAS

47.
Experience with implementation of the last CAS has been positive, but has taught a
number of lessons:
*

The focus on reforming states over the last three years has brought many benefits. State
reforms have, however, been more difficult to initiate and sustain than expected, and
many of the reforns the Bank Group is supporting are politically controversial. The
benefits of reform (e.g., fewer power blackouts, reliable drinking water supply, fiscal
sustainability) start appearing only after substantial initial cost (e.g., higher tariffs,
reduced subsidies, staff retrenchment) and controversy (e.g., privatization). For the
future, Bank support for reforms needs to give more attention to the electoral cycle at the

Bank management has largely endorsed these recommendations - see Annex 3 for the Management
Response to the CAE recommendations as contained in the Management Action Record.

state level and the importance of broad political ownership of reforms.
*

The Bank has been heavily involved in power sector reforms for several years now,
beginning in Orissa in 1996, and now in five other states as well (Haryana, Andhra
Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Karnataka). Since then, privatization of
distribution, once dismissed as an option, has become national policy. Independent
regulatory conmnissionshave been established in almost all major states. Power reforms
may, however, require much longer than the Bank had earlier anticipated. Agricultural
and residential customers continue to receive huge subsidies, but are unwilling to pay
more until power quality improves. Meanwhile, the burden of past financial losses is
mounting, and high-paying industrial consumers are leaving the grid, making the task of
privatization all the more difficult. The adaptable program loan (APL) instrument has
proven to be effective in this context (para. 64). A review, by external consultants, of the
Orissa experience has yielded useful lessons for implementingpower sector reforms
elsewhere.

CONSULTATIONS
48.
As part of the process of updating the Bank Group's country assistance strategy, a
series of consultations were organized both on experience with past assistance and on
priorities for the future. Twelve sectoral workshops were organized in conjunction with
OED. They were attended by 40 plus participants drawn from a range of backgrounds central and state government officials, NGOs, academics, private sector, and other
multilateral and bilateral agencies. The final workshop was attended by a similarly diverse
group numbering over 100 in total. These workshops gave participants the chance to look
both backwards, to review the past, and forwards, to make suggestions for the future, and
helped the Bank Group to ground its ambitions for the future in the reality of past
implementation outcomes.
49.
Separate consultation workshops were conducted in the capitals of three states. In
addition, EFCand the Bank conducted a consultation with representatives of the business
cornmunityin Mumbai. A "Bank in India" image survey was commissioned to garner the
perceptions of different sectors of Indian society towards the World Bank. Finally, a CAS
web site was established to continue the CAS dialogue in electronic form.3 Some of the main
findings of these consultations are summarized in Annex 4.

B. OVERVIEW OF BANK GROUP STRATEGY
50.
Given the level of shared understanding between the Government and the Bank in
respect of both diagnosis and strategy, this CAS is built around the strategic objectives of
India's Ninth Five Year Plan. This approach received strong support during the CAS
consultations. The Bank Group's program objectives are thus defined around the Plan
themes of strengthening the enabling environmentfor development and growth and
supporting critical interventions of special benefit to the poor and disadvantaged. To
translate the broad poverty reduction strategy of India to a specific Bank Group assistance
program, the strategic principles of selectivity, partnership, anda programmatic approach

will be applied, in consultation with the Government of India, the Bank Group's principal
partner in the country. Figure 1 illustratesthe overall approach taken in this CAS, and
summarizes the link between the Government's Plan, the Bank Group's strategic principles
and program priorities. Annex B9 provides further details in the form of a program matrix.

C. STRATEGICPRINCIPLES
SELECTIVITY

51.
Underlying both the selection of the Bank Group's strategic priorities and their
implementation is the principle of selectivity, especially important in a country as large and
as full of potential as India There is a need to focus, not just on what is important, but also on
where Bank Group assistance can have the greatest impact. There are areas of business from
which the Bank Group has disengaged completely in the interests of selectivity. For
example, it no longer supports crop-specific rural development schemes or the national
railways. In other areas, a clear division of labor makes sense. For example, IBRD/IDA will
no longer finance sectors such as thermal generation, telecom and ports, coal, oil and gas,
where the private sector can invest with support from IFC and MIGA as required. Above all,
selectivity in the Indian context means: (i) maintaining the state focus, (ii) selective

India: CountryAssistance Strategy

Page 17

interventionsin other, non-focus states, and (iii) a strong but selective program of
supportfor the Government of India.
State Focus

52.
In line with the Plan's emphasis on the importance of state governments as
determinants of India's success in reducing poverty (paras. 4243), the Bank's assistance
strategy has also been reoriented over the last CAS period. It now focuses mainly on those
states that (i) have chosen to embark on a comprehensive program of economic reforms,
including fiscal and governance reforms and reforms of key sectors such as power, (ii) have
expressed interest in entering into a partnership with the Bank, and (iii) where poverty levels
are relatively high. Andhra Pradesh (AP) became the Bank's first focus state three years ago
and has since been joined by Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Karnataka. An active dialogue has also
been established with a few other states such as Orissa and Rajasthan. Lending to the focus
states is expected to be about 40% of the Bank's lending program over the CAS period.
53.
The focus state strategy enables the Bank to initiate a Comprehensive Development
Framework (CDF) approach that would probably not be possible at the all-India level. It
allows for a broad approach to be taken to promote growth and accelerate poverty reduction,
based on a deeper understanding of a state's specific social, political and economic position
as well as a wide-ranging and high-level partnership. The Bank's assistance program in a
focus state is normally articulated around a state-specific assistance strategy. Developed in
consultation with the Government of India, this builds on the vision and policy statements of
the state government and aims at maximizing the synergies between different lending and
non-lending activities, including institutional capacity building through technical assistance,
across a wide range of economic activities and through partnership with other donor agencies
to maximize impact. The comprehensive reform agenda the Bank supports in the focus states
is based on that proposed by the Government of India for states to follow (Box 2).
54.
An important question is whether the Bank might be missing a large segment of
India's poor by concentrating on a few reforming states. In fact, most of India's poorer states
are embracing reform to one degree or another, and major funding agencies are active in all
of them. The three states the Bank is currently most active in, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh
and Karnataka, for instance, are all relatively poor, either in terms of income poverty, or
social indicators, or both. Moreover, the Bank intends to continueto support social sector
projects in India's poorest states, whether or not they are focus states, provided that there is
some assurance that the support will not be wasted due to corruption or poor governance. In
some of the poorest but non-reforming states, policy dialogue and capacity building may well
be the most effective interventions of the Bank. All states will benefit from the catalytic
demonstration effect of accelerated development in states pursuing comprehensive reforms.
Unusual sectoral merit

55.
In addition to working closely with a relatively small number of focus states, there
will be a continuing need for activities in other states, especially those pursuing important
sectoral reforms. Such activities will need to be justified by using merit criteria, such as: (i)
having an unusually high development or demonstration impact, because of their innovative
nature, or the importance, either of the investment, or of the reform being promoted (e.g.,
decentralized rural water supply in Kerala); (ii) extending support to the social sectors in
India's poorest states, provided there is a good likelihood of the funds being used effectively;

India: CountryAssistance Strategy

Page 18

or (iii) being in states which are not focus states for the Bank but nevertheless reforming at
least in some key sectors.
Supportfor Government of India
56.
The Bank's state focus needs to be balanced by a strong but selective program of
support to the national government. On the lending side, there are a number of issues which
are best tackled at the national level, such as the development of a national highway system,
or the combating of infectious diseases, including HIV/AIDS. On the non-lending side, the
Bank will continue to focus on technical assistance, dissemination, and dialogue on issues of
national importance where the Bank has international expertise. The Bank plays a useful
convening role in India, and has organized and is planning a number of national conferences,
co-sponsored with the Government of India. Four priority areas for policy dialogue in the
coming years at the national level are: agriculture and rural development, fiscal and
governance reform, financial sector development, and health sector reforms.
PARTNERSHIP
AND OUTREACH

57.
To use the Bank Group's limited resources effectively and with catalytic impact
requires establishing partnerships with the Bank Group's clients and other donors and
stakeholders, based on a shared vision and principles. The Government of India is of course
the Bank Group's principal partner, but additional partnerships are pursued with its support.
IFC has important partnerships with a number of Indian financial institutions. An illustrative
list of partnerships is presented in Annex 5; more details are provided in the country program
matrix (Annex B9).
58.
Partnerships at the state level are particularly important in the context of the
Bank's state work. First, integral to the state focus is the building of a close partnership with
the Bank's client, the reforming state government, that must be able to see in the Bank a
partner capable of providing sustained support while it implements politically difficult and
controversial reforms. Second, the Bank's support to state governments is delivered in
partnership with the Central Government. Lending to the states is pursued only with the
endorsement of the Government of India. As the Government of India is increasingly turning
to performance and incentive-based resource allocations (first for fiscal reforms, now for
power reforms), there are tremendous opportunities to deepen the partnership with GoI. The
Bank's adjustment lending to Uttar Pradesh, for instance, was effectively co-financed by the
Central Government through their performnance-based
fund allocations backed by a
Memorandum of Understanding comprising policy conditions very similar to the adjustment
loan.
59.
Partnerships with donors are characteristic of most of the Bank's work. In
highways, for instance, a joint Bank-ADB assistance strategy is being formulated. Projects
prepared with the Bank's transport technical assistance project are being considered for
financing by ADB. Partnerships with the UN family in its focus areas for India, of
decentralization and gender, are also important. Partnerships will also continue to be a
mainstay of the Bank's engagement in the health sector (including HIV/AIDS, malaria,
leprosy, etc.) where bilateral donors and multilateral agencies (e.g., UN, EU) have
traditionally concentrated their assistance. In addition, as several bilateral donors have
recently strengthened their aid program to India, the Bank, through its country office in Delhi,
will intensify its information-sharingand coordination activities, particularly with regards to
sectors or states of specific interest to the local donor community. Increasingly the Bank is

India: CountryAssistance Strategy

Page19

working with NGOs and other elements of the civil society in designing and implementing its
projects.
60.
Partnerships for the global environment. The Bank-India partnership with the
Global Environmental Facility (GEF) and the Montreal Protocol includes the world's second
largest program to eliminate the production and use of ozone-depleting substances, and a
long-term partnership on climate change. The climate change strategy is coordinated with
India's power reform programs (which will, in themselves, bring substantial global
environmental benefits) and promotes both renewable energy and energy efficiency gains. It
will assist India in building its existing technologies and capabilities in climate-friendly
technologies as well as attracting possible future Clean Development Mechanism resources.
With respect to bio-diversity, the South Asia Region's forestry, natural and water resources
strategies provide the basis for future GEF support. A new India GEF strategy, currently
under discussion with the Government of India, is expected to lead to an expanded GEF
program in the coming years.
61.
Scaling up is essential in India for impact, and can only be done through
partnerships. There are areas in the CAS where the Bank's experience has been relatively
limnitedbut where bilateral donors as well as some multilateral agencies have developed an
impressive track record of successful experiments, particularly in rural development and
urban slum improvement. Often the scale of these experiments is constrained by the volume
of resources available to them, but by building on these successful initiatives, the Bank is able
to scale them up. The Bank itself can also pilot successful innovations, which Government of
India is then able to scale up. Box 3 gives some examples of successful scaling-up
experiences in which the Bank has been involved.

62.
Outreach. An important complement to partnership is the Bank Group's overall
outreach. The pace at which reforms can be implemented is significantly affected by public
opinion. The onus of informing the public and developing consensus rests with the concerned
governments, who need to devise appropriate communication strategies. However, in
response to the issues raised at the CAS consultations (Annex 4), a special effort will be made
to extend the Bank Group's own outreach and to establish continual dialogue with
stakeholders. This will be done through wider dissemination of the Bank Group's reports and
disclosure of project documents (especially in local languages), greater engagement with civil
society organizations and opinion makers, and keeping stakeholders of specific projects
continually informed and consulted.
PROGRAMMATICAPPROACH

63.
In India, the Bank has to think of its support and goals over the longer term, with
change taking place over a period of many years rather than overnight. Increasingly,
therefore, the Bank is taking a programmatic approach towards its support to India, be it at
the central level or in the states, and using different instruments depending on the nature and
content of the programs pursued.
Programmatic instruments
64.
Adaptable program loans (APLs) are particularly well-suited to the Bank's support
for power sector reforms in the states and were the instruments used in Haryana and Andhra
Pradesh during the last CAS period. Giving clients an early indication of the Bank's longterm support for politically challenging reforms proved to be critical in getting the reform
process underway in these states. The need to lay out the reform implementation process as
well as the ability to identify milestones ex-ante helped forge a closer partnership between the
state governments and the Bank, clarified expectations and maintained an open and
transparent framework for pursuing a very difficult policy agenda. The flexibility provided
by the APL, enabling the Bank to pace its assistance with the government's ability to pursue
reforms, and to give assurance of quick support the moment the program is resumed, has
proven to be particularly helpful in Haryana where the program has been stalled following a
change in government.
65.
With the state-focussed assistance strategy, the Bank is also supporting a complex
array of social and structural reforms in states that are invariably facing severe budgetary
constraints. The core program of fiscal and governancereforms is an area for which the
Bank's programmatic approach is best suited: reforms take several years to be effective, and
support needs to be flexible and consistent enough to withstand the uncertainties India's
complex political environment generates. Moving forward with reforms also requires
assurance of a reasonable degree of financial support over the medium-term. Hence, the
Bank's planned use of programmaticstructural adjustment loans (PSALs) to the states as
a means of providing predictable performance-based budget support and enabling the states
to restore their financial equilibrium while undertaking reforms at the same time.
66.
A programmatic approach is also effective in community-based rural development
projects which involve sectoral policy changes as well as a high degree of experimentation
and piloting. As explained in the next section (para. 102), adopting a programmatic
investment lending approach whereby individual projects are tailored to the particular
circumstances and needs of individual states, learning and adjusting takes places as projects
are implemented, and scaling up is done as successes are identified, has become a

India: CountryAssistance Strategy

Page21

fundamental element of the CAS. It will be intensified to support decentralization and
community-baseddevelopment, through a mix of mutually-reinforcing analytical and project
work. The scaling up of programs outlined in Box 3, often in collaboration with partners, has
been possible only through a programmatic approach.
Mainstreaming environmental and social considerations
67.
This CAS aims to support the fundamental goals of social development, gender
equity, and environmental protection and improvementnot as separate interventions but
by including actions in these areas in a programmatic approach. For example, work in the
environment will stress: the environmental determinants of health, and how to tackle them
(para. 98); the links between rural poverty and natural resource degradation (para. 99); and
the reductions in pollution possible by improved environmental governance. Energyenvironmental linkages will continue to be a part of the Bank's support for India's power
sector reform programs (para. 84), and will complement work on global environmental issues
(para. 60).
68.
Given the seriousness of gender inequities in India, the Bank plans to intensify its
efforts to mainstream gender in the coming CAS period. The primary means for doing this
remains through education and health interventions with particular targeting for women and
children (paras. 95 and 98). Women's empowermentis a prominent component of the Banksupported community-based projects, many of which are working with women's groups
(para. 102). Gender issues will feature more in non-lending services: for example, state-level
rural policy reviews can highlight discrimination against women in respect of property rights.
Gender-disaggregatedmonitoring and evaluation (M&E) is increasingly used to track
progress in reducing gender inequality; building capacity in government to do the same will
be a natural complement (para. 71).
69.
A programmatic approach also enables the Bank to strengthen its medium-term
approach to safeguard compliance, a critical, and often controversial, issue in India. This is
consistent with the emerging emphasis on strategic (sectoral and regional) environmental and
social assessments, local ownership, consensus-buildingand capacity-developmentamong
the Bank's clients. Activities ranging from training to working with interested governments
to developing sectoral environmental or resettlementpolicies will improve outcomes for all
projects in a particular sector, not just those which happen to be financed by the Bank.
Building an effective alliance with governmentsand other stakeholders for improving
environmental and social outcomes is key for success, and will have much greater impact
than the imposition of any number of compliance conditions in relation to any specific
project.
Fiduciary safeguards
70.
Fiduciary safeguards also take on an increased importance within a programmatic
approach, as the focus shifts from ring-fencing projects to ensuring sound financial practices
across government. A comprehensive national review of procurement practices is being
carried out. The first phase, dealing with central government procurement practices, is
complete. Its recommendations are now under review, while a second phase assessment is
being carried out for state government procurement practices in Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh,
and Tamil Nadu. National and state-level assessments of financial management and
accountability have been initiated. Key lessons learnt and recommendations from this
analytical work are summarized in Annex 6, which also outlines plans for the future.

India: CountryAssistance Strategy

Page 22

Promotion of transparency in procurement and financial accountability are also key elements
of the Bank's governance work in India.
Monitoring and leamning
71.
For the programmatic approach to succeed, the Bank needs to significantly enhance
its capacity to monitor intermediate and final outcomes, be they of policy reforms at the state
level or of individual projects, and to improve its work based on what is learnt. The
monitoring of individual projects will be strengthened, building on the regional poverty
monitoring and evaluation workshop held in Delhi in June, 2000. The Bank is also assisting
individual states, first Uttar Pradesh and now Karnataka, to establish poverty and social
monitoring systems to track changes in key intermediateand outcome indicators, including
access to public services as well as income and non-income dimensions of poverty. The
objective is to build capacity to put more information about key poverty outcomes and
variables into the public domain. It can then be used in several ways, including: to identify
positive as well as adverse consequences of reforms on the poor; to improve performance and
accountability of public sector entities; and to keep the public informed of successes and
difficulties linked to the reform process. Box 4 gives an update of the progress made to date
in Uttar Pradesh.

and use informationto assessandultimatelyimproveperformancewill requirecontinuingsupport.
72.
Learning from reform experiments is also important (e.g., review of implementation
of power sector reforms in Orissa). The Bank will continue to emphasize monitoring and
evaluation of reforms, particularly fiscal adjustment and governance where, despite
significant variations in the initial conditions, there is tremendous potential for states to learn
from - and indeed challenge - one another. The recently held States Reform Forum was a
step in this direction. The Bank will also monitor carefully and undertake supporting analytic
work to better understand the impacts of its innovative participatory rural development
projects and alternative delivery mechanisms.
73.
The success of the Government's poverty reduction strategy as well as of the efficacy
of Bank Group support for that strategy can be judged ultimately by reference to India's
progress towards the International Development Goals (Box 1). The Bank plans to support
the Central Government to better monitor these and related key development outcomes.
Given the ongoing debate on poverty measurement, it is not possible to set targets for poverty
reduction for the next few years which would command widespread support. Until there is a

India: CountryAssistance Strategy

Page23

greater consensus, the Bank will focus on monitoring progress in terms of intermediate
variables such as GDP growth, agricultural growth, real wages, agriculturalproductivity and
food prices, and will also continue to support research to try to help resolve this important
debate. To tackle the more general problem of weaknesses in the statistical system, the
Government of India has established a National Statistical Commission, which is shortly to
submit its first report. The Bank expects to resume discussions with the Government on
support for statistical strengtheningand modernization once the Commission has reported.
74.
Quantitative targets for key human development indicators are easier to derive from
existing baseline data:
* Based on the GoI policy on universal elementary enrollment by 2009, India should have
by 2004 (the end of the CAS period):
. achieved 90% enrollment of 6-14 year olds (up from 79% currently)
. and halved the gender gap to 4.5 percentage points.
• To be on track to meet its health targets by the IDG target date of 2015, India should
have, by 2004:
. reduced under-5 mortality to 80 per 1000 (from 95 today)
. reduced maternal mortality to 400 per 100,000 live births (from 540 today)
. and increased access to contraceptive services to 64% of eligible couples (up
from 48% today).

III. PROGRAM PRIORITIES
A. STRENGTHENING
THEENABLINGENVIRONMENTFOR
DEVELOPMENTANDGROWTH
75.
The Bank Group is committed to supporting achievement of the Ninth Plan goal of
strengthening the enabling environment. This involves the parallel and complementary tasks
of improving government effectiveness and allowing the private sector to contribute fully to
economic development. The Bank Group's strategy focuses, within each of these themes, on
more specific objectives based on its comparative advantage, using the strategic principles
articulated in the previous section.
EFFECTIVENESS
IMPROVING
GOVERNMENT
76.
The Bank Group fully supports the priority the Government accords to fiscal and
governance reforms (paras. 29-32). In April 2000, the Bank extended the first adjustment
loan to India after a gap of almost seven years to support Uttar Pradesh' s fiscal and
governance reform programs. This initial loan will be followed by similar one-tranche
adjustment loans to other reforming states (e.g., Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and possibly
Orissa, in addition to Uttar Pradesh itself). Over the CAS period, adjustment lending of
US$500-900 million a year for fiscal and governance reforms in the context of annual total
lending of US$3 billion is planned.
Fiscal reform

77.
The core vehicle for fiscal reform is the development and implementation of
medium-term fiscal frameworks which, by cutting wasteful spending and reversing tax ratio
declines, can lead to fiscal sustainability while protecting and indeed promoting priority
social and infrastructure spending. They have now been adopted by several states, including
Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh (with Bank support), and Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh
(with support from the ADB). Experience confirms that strengtheningthese frameworks is
not a technical matter, but rather an issue of institutionalizing them into the government's
planning and budgeting process and providing incentives for key stakeholders to adhere to
aggregate targets and to better prioritize spending within these targets. Over the coming CAS
period, reforms to better institutionalize public expenditure management will become an
increasingly central aspect of programs that the Bank will support.
Governance Reform

78.
There is a widespread consensus in India, endorsed by Ninth Plan documents, that
fiscal reforms need to be accompaniedby improvements in governance. Since so many of
the sectors suffer from common problems (over-staffing, corruption, poor budgetary
management, lack of public financial accountability, weak monitoring and evaluation), the
Bank plans to address this by supporting state-level comprehensive, inter-sectoral governance
reform programs, particularly in the focus states, through adjustment lending. Equally
important, the Bank is integrating these institutional reforms into the design of its sectoral
operations and into its sectoral dialogue to improve service delivery and strengthen

India: CountryAssistance Strategy

Page25

government effectiveness on a sector-by-sectorbasis. This approach is being taken across the
sectors, from roads to power, and education to health and environment, in the Bank's focus
states - again it is the in-depth engagement allowed for by the focus state strategy which
enables the Bank to follow this CDF approach.
79.
While the Bank's main operational focus is at the state level, it will also intensify its
dialogue on the complex fiscal and governance issues facing the central government. In this
case, the Bank sees analytical work, technical assistance, and policy dialogue as more
appropriate instruments to support Gol in developing a fiscal deficit reduction strategy. The
Bank will need to work concurrently with the central and state governments on a number of
issues such as fiscal federalism and public financial accountability and to support initiatives,
which began almost two years ago, to link the allocation of central resources to reforms and
perforrnance at the state level.
80.
Analytical work. The agenda for improving government effectiveness is a complex
one, which involves considerable learning by doing. The Bank's latest economic report
(SSPR) as well as its state reports all go into fiscal and governance issues in depth. However,
there is still need for much more analytical work, and the Bank expects governance to be a
focus of non-lending services in the coming years. The Bank will continue with public
expenditure reviews at the state level, and will also complete a national public expenditure
review in the coming CAS period. The Bank will also be undertaking institutional
assessments, particularly at the sectoral level, and aims to develop monitorable indicators for
measuring progress in government effectiveness. The Bank's analytical work in governance
will also focus on issues of fiduciary responsibility, such as procurement and financial
accountability (Annex 6).
Decentralization
81.
Strengthening local governmentsto improve service delivery, responsiveness and
accountability has been a priority of the Government since the Constitutional Amendments of
1993. Capacity building of Urban local bodies (ULBs) is now the cornerstone of the Bank's
urban sector strategy. The Bank has recently completed its first in-depth analysis of rural
decentralization issues. While the Bank is still learning its way in this complex area, it can
already identify decentralization to local governments as part of its strategy to ensure that
pro-poor rural initiatives are based on beneficiary consultation, empowerment and
participation (para. 102). In the medium term, the Bank will work with interested states,
through both its governance dialogue and its sectoral projects, in three priority areas: (i)
clarifying the roles and functions of the three levels of local governments vis-a-vis each other,
line agencies and user groups; (ii) financial devolution and improved local taxation and cost
recovery; and (iii) improved accountability to local constituents.
PROMOTINGPRIVATE SECTOR LED GROWTH

82.
As noted in the Ninth Plan, promoting private sector led growth and investment will
be critical for accelerated poverty reduction in India. The Bank Group will focus on four
areas covered by the Ninth Plan's strategies in this area: (i) availability of high-quality
infrastructure; (ii) creating the conditions for accelerated growth in rural areas; (iii)
promoting competitiveness in industry and services; and (iv) strengthening the financial
sector.

India: CountryAssistance Strategy

Page26

Availability of high-quality infrastructure

83.
The Bank Group's strategy is to help create the necessary conditions for both the
private and public sectors to play their roles efficiently. It is widely accepted, for example,
that most investments in India's transport system will have to come from within the public
sector (para. 36). This places enormous importance on public sector reform in transport to
improve construction and maintenance efficiency. Institutional strengthening, at both the
national and the state level, and reforms to promote transparency, contracting out, and
stakeholder involvement, are key to the Bank Group' s transport reform program. Transport
will be an important component of the Bank program in India, with on average one national
highway, and one to two state transport projects every year. There is also scope for private
investment in selected components of the transport network, including ports, airports, toll
roads and bridges. Whenever the enabling environment is adequate, IFC will help finance
pioneering investments in these areas.
84.
The Bank Group will continue its support for power sector reforms, one of the main
components of the earlier CAS (para. 47). The Bank Group is increasingly integrating its
fiscal and power analysis and reforms as it becomes clearer that without power sector reformns
no state will be able to devote sufficient resources to the social sectors and other high-priority
areas. The Bank is also paying greater attention to power-rural linkages through analytical
work, which shows how farmers will benefit rather than lose from power sector reforms.
Bank loans in power will continue to finance pre-privatization investments to improve
quality, but may also reflect a new emphasis on complementary rural infrastructure
investments to mitigate the cost of power sector reforms on farming communities. Over the
coming CAS period, operations are planned to support power sector reforms in Andhra
Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Karnataka. In power, IFC' s focus is on supporting
pioneering private investments in those states that demonstrate commnitmentto power sector
reforms, with a high priority on supporting the newly privatized distribution companies that
the reform process will establish. IFC will also support captive, co-generation, renewable
energy, energy-efficient power projects and other private projects selling power to third
parties.
85.
Improved connectivity is essential if the poor are to benefit from technological
change, and to support continued rapid growth of India's IT industry. To address the
problems of limited last mile access, poor domestic bandwidth and poor international
bandwidth, EFCwill consider investments in fixed line and cellular telephones, international
gateway operators, and domestic fiber optic backbones. IFC and the Bank will support
innovative applications of information and communication technologies to serve the poor.
86.
Urban water and sanitation is also an area where the private sector has an
important potential role to play, even though the sector is currently even less financially
viable and commercially oriented than the power sector. The Bank Group has developed a
new urban water strategy that emphasizes private sector provision, and plans a number of
dissemination and consensus-building activities to help reforming urban bodies identify and
implement private sector solutions. In those states or urban centers where reforms are
establishing an enabling environment for a viable and sustainable role for the private sector,
IFC will lend its support to efficient private sector involvement in water supply & sanitation
and solid waste management. Beyond urban water, the Bank will support the strengthening
of municipal urban services through urban reform programs (e.g., in Gujarat), and related
financial inter-mediation packages, and strategies to integrate urban infrastructure into wider

India: CountryAssistance Strategy

Page27

financing systems (e.g., Community Infrastructure, Andhra Pradesh Urban Poverty and
Karnataka Municipal Capacity Building projects).
87.
Disaster management and rehabilitation. Indiais extremely disaster-prone. Since
1975, the total number of people seriously affected by disasters in India has been an average
of about 50 million people per year. The November 1999 Orissa super-cyclone and the
January 2001 Gujarat earthquake killed about 10,000 and 20,000 people respectively. The
Bank was requested to provide assistance on both occasions. At the time of finalization of
this CAS, the Bank is working to prepare an assistancepackage in response to the Gujarat
earthquake. The core elements of this and similar packages are physical and social
infrastructure, housing rehabilitation and strengtheningof disaster management capacity.
Since natural disasters are a major source of vulnerability in India, the Bank is planning work
on strengtheningdisaster management capacity, at both the national and the state level.
Accelerating rural growth

88.
About 75% of India's poor live in rural areas, and of these about 80% are largely
dependent on agriculture. The Bank will continue to support investments and reforms in
rural infrastructure (irrigation, rural roads and markets, drinking water supply and
sanitation), and agricultural support services (technology generation and dissemination). To
meet the growing challenge of sustainable and more equitable use of increasingly scarce
water resources in India, the Bank's support in the water sector (e.g., in Rajasthan, Uttar
Pradesh and Karnataka) will be closely linked to institutional reforms, greater user
participation and cost recovery. The Bank will also support the Government's increased
emphasis on the holistic development of rain-fed areas, where a large share of the rural poor
reside, using watersheds as the basis and taking a participatory approach (para. 102), e.g.,
Karnataka Watershed and Andhra Pradesh Rural Poverty projects.
89.
The other requirement for accelerating rural growth is agricultural deregulation.
The Bank's overall analytical work on deregulation of the rural economy is largely complete
and the measures needed to liberalize agricultural input and output markets, for example, are
well known and lie largely, although not exclusively, with the central government. The Bank
will continue with its program of research, dialogue and dissemination in this area. In
addition, in future, Bank involvement in the rural sector in its focus states will be preceded by
rural policy reviews which will highlight state-specific as well as central government
constraints and remedies in the rural sector, and which will form a basis for dialogue in the
concerned state. IFC will explore possibilities to promote the development of competitive
and efficient agricultural markets by investing in key agribusiness activities where the private
sector has so far played a limited role (e.g., food supply chains, warehouse industry).
Competitiveness in Industry and Services

90.
The Bank Group will work with selected state governments on deregulation and
improvement of the investment climate, while continuing to engage the central government
through policy dialogue and advice on reforms that fall within its purview (e.g., trade
liberalization and deregulation, labor market regulations, entry & exit regulations). The Bank
will also focus on promoting policy and institutional reforms in the area of technical
education to improve the quality of India's pool of technical manpower. EFCwill assist by
investing in second-tier manufacturing and service companies that are either moving towards
a regional and/or global presence or restructuring and modernizing to become internationally
competitive. Many of these companies also need to restructure their finances as, during the

India: Country Assistance Strategy

Page28

years when the local equity markets were inactive, they became over-leveraged. In
supporting the financial restructuring of fundamentally viable companies in partnership with
local institutions, IFC will aim to mobilize additional resources from Indian financial
markets, thus creating synergies with its financial market development work. Since many
companies have limited capacity to take on foreign currency debt, investments will often be
made in local currency, using guarantees of loans from domestic financial institutions or by
providing local currency loans using swap arrangements. IFC's work with these companies
will also promote improved corporate governance and attention to environmental and social
sustainability.
Financial Sector Development
91.
The Bank Group will provide selective support for financial sector development. The
Bank will offer analytical advice and possibly technical assistance to government and
regulatory institutions as needed. Key imperatives are to improve regulation, supervision and
transparency to cope with the increased private sector role in the sector, improve information
in the system (for example by developing a credit registry), and improve the legal framework
for use of collateral. The Bank will also work with the government in selected areas of
capital markets supervision and regulation and improving the pension system.
92.
IFC will take the lead on capital market development by investing in private banks
and financial institutions and helping them strengthentheir capacity to mobilize resources
and extend financial services, by supporting the use of innovative market instruments, and by
selective credit enhancements to promote market acceptance of longer-term debt. IFC's
ability to assist in the development of the local debt market is constrained by the large-scale
absorption of savings into government debt and the pattern of institutions holding paper until
maturity, which means that the essential ingredients for an active market - a willing buyer
and a willing seller - are not yet present. IFC's work in the debt market will therefore be at
the margins, helping to develop the necessary market infrastructure and to introduce new
products such as partial credit guarantees of rupee bond issues. It also plans to invest in
housing finance companies and assist in the creation of a secondary mortgage mnarketvia
pilot securitization of mortgages. IFC will pay particular attention through its financial
market development efforts to promoting greater access to finance by small and medium
enterprises.
93.
An aspect of the financial sector of particular relevance to the poor is micro-finance.
IFC recently made its first investment in India in a commercial micro-finance provider, and
will continue to focus on micro-finance, helping to develop sustainable commercial
institutions in the under-served sector. Two Bank-funded projects have started to help rural
self-help groups (frequently groups of women) to utilize the substantial but often inaccessible
rural banking system. The demand-side approach to the reform of rural banking and spread
of micro-finance in India is a promising one. The Bank will monitor the results closely
before deciding whether to intensify this strategy or change course. In urban areas, the Bank
is also helping to develop a pilot project to enhance access to credit for the urban poor and
low-income groups for community infrastructure through community-based finance
institutions.

B. SUPPORTING CRITICAL PRO-POOR INTERVENTIONS
94.
India's poverty reduction strategy recognizes the importance of government
intervening to ensure that opportunities for improved livelihood are widely available across

India: Country Assistance Strategy

Page 29

the entire spectrum of society, that the security of these livelihoods is promoted and that the
constraints that inhibit and exclude people from participating in and sharing the benefits of
development are removed. The Bank's focus on two areas, promoting education and health,
and supportingpro-poor rural development, reflects their critical importance as well as the
Bank's comparative advantage.
PROMOTINGEDUCATIONANDHEALTH FOR ALL

Elementary Education
95.
The selective thrust of the Bank's intervention will continue to be to support India's
goal to achieve universal elementary education, with particular focus on improving the
quality of education provided, and giving priority to the poor and disadvantaged, particularly
girls and children in rural areas. Reducing the number of out-of-school children will
contribute to the fight against child labor (Box 5).
96.
So far, the Bank's main vehicle for achieving these objectives has been the District
Primary Education Program (DPEP). The Bank is now entering a new phase, based on an
agreement with the Government that there is a need to move beyond DPEP, including by
extending support beyond lower primary (for children aged 6-10) to upper primary (for ages
11-14). The extent and scope of Bank assistance in the future for elementary education will
largely depend on reaching agreement with Gol on Bank support for Gol's new mission for
education (para. 39) and on the Bank's role in supporting state governments, who are the
main financiers of education in India. Support for elementary education is therefore included
in the lending program though the exact content remains to be identified.
97.
Success in elementary education during the 1990s has highlighted important
pressures for change in specific areas of education - urban education (particularly elementary
education for the poorest), private education, secondary education, and integrated child
development interventions that maximize poor children's life chances through education and
provide special assistance to working children. The Bank is already supporting analytic work
in some of these areas and is prepared to add to this work in consultation with the
Government. IFC is considering investments in private educational enterprises, with a
particular focus on exploiting new information and communication technologies.

Page 30

Health

98.
The Bank's strategy in health is shaped around three objectives: (i) to focus on health
issues of priority to the poor, including child health, reproductive health, and communicable
disease control; (ii) to assist in developing the capacity to manage public health programs
effectively, such as in surveillance and food and drug control; and (iii) to aid in developing
more efficient, effective, and sustainable health systems at the state level, that will better
serve the needs of the poor. Particular focus will be placed on meeting new health threats
such as LIL/AIDS, through implementationof the second phase of the Bank's support for
India's HI/AIDS prevention program (para. 3). In addition, lessons learned from the large
ongoing health portfolio in India and analytical work also lead to several areas of new
emphasis:
•

Bank-assisted health efforts will be increasingly decentralized and tied to building state
capacity to manage health systems effectively, and more and more integrated through a
programmatic approach.

*

Building on a major piece of sector work on public/private roles in health currently under
completion, as well as on successful public/privatepartnerships in various Bank-assisted
health projects, the Bank Group will support India in developing health strategies which
focus more than before on the relative strengths of government, local communities,
NGOs and the private sector. IFC will also support investments to improve the quality of
private health care services.

*

The Bank will pay greater attention to environmental health issues, including water,
sanitation and indoor air pollution, on which important sector work has recently been
done. The Bank is now modifying the design of its new water and sanitation projects to
help maximize health benefits, and hopes to pilot cross-sectoral approaches to improving
the health and livelihoods of the poor through concentrating health, infrastructure,
education, and environmental interventions in specific areas.

ACCELERATING PRO-POOR RURAL DEVELOPMENT

99.
The Bank's efforts to support key investments in rural infrastructure and support
services are designed not only to promote more rapid and sustained rural growth (para. 88),
but also to directly attack rural poverty and enhance social protection. Natural resource
management projects, for example, attack poverty by increasing access to resources (such as
formerly waste and forest lands) by groups of poor and landless. Some 100 million poor,
including more than half of India's 70 million tribals, rely on forests as their main source of
livelihood. Projects such as the planned community forestry projects in Andhra Pradesh and
Madhya Pradesh will also deliver important environmental goals, such as land reclamation,
forest regeneration and bio-diversity protection.
100. The key question concerningrural developmentprojects is not their potential impact
on poverty, which is enormous, but whether these projects can be successfully delivered by
an ailing public sector. The Mid-Term Appraisal of the Ninth Plan has noted the need for
more effective anti-poverty programs (para. 41). Given the need for selectivity, the key role
the Bank can play in this huge area, in which government spending dwarves that of the Bank,
is to pilot new approaches, and help scale up those which have proved themselves to be
effective. A programmatic approach is thus key. This enables the Bank to tailor projects to
the particular circumstances and needs of individual states, learning and adjusting as it goes,

India: Country Assistance Strategy

Page 31

and scale up as successes are identified.
101. Deepening the rural asset base through rural infrastructureprojects is closely linked
to the complementary goal of strengtheningthe rural safety net. Increasing the level of
social protection for India's poor is of critical importance since they are extremely vulnerable
to external shocks, such as droughts, floods and illnesses. The provision of assets is itself a
risk-reduction strategy, as is the development of social capital, and the spread of micro-credit.
Besides piloting effective projects that deliver these goals, the Bank also has an active
dialogue on food subsidies, which could be part of an effective safety net, but are currently
large and poorly targeted, and badly in need of reform, both to help liberalize rural grain
markets and to better serve the poor.
102. While specific rural development sub-sectors (forestry, watershed, etc.) demand
specific solutions, the Bank's work will also be governed by a number of cross-cutting
principles:
*

First is the emphasis given to beneficiary involvement and empowerment that is and
will continue to be an integral aspect of the Bank's rural sector projects. The Bank is
now moving on to another phase in its participatory work, with the new District Poverty
Initiative Projects (DPIPs) in several states. These provide community groups with
greater choice in their selection of investments.

*

A second emphasis is the use of non-govermnent organizations andalternative service
delivery providers.

*

Institutional reforms and capacity building are critical at both the state and local
government and community levels to promote transparency,reduce establishment costs,
and cut down on corruption.

•

Cost recovery. There is a widening consensus that user charges should at least cover
operational costs, but the institutional arrangements are often not in place to translate this
principle into practice. A precedent in this regard is being set in Uttar Pradesh, where a
water regulatory authority is being establishedto set, among other things, irrigation
tariffs.

-

Targeting. To intensify their pro-poor focus, these rural programs all need to be
carefully targeted both at the poorest areas and, wherever possible, at the most vulnerable
groups, women, scheduled castes and scheduledtribes, and the landless.

103. Community-driven developmentin urban areas. Although the Bank's main focus
is on rural poverty, it recognizes that urban poverty will become an increasingly important
problem with a higher rate of urban growth and faster expansion of large urban areas
projected for the next decade. Most of the Bank's work in urban areas will be focused on
strengthening local urban governments and expanding opportunities for private sector
infrastructure investments. Unlike in rural areas, the Bank's work in community-driven
development and social protection in urban areas is just starting. Other funding agencies
have taken the lead in this regard, especially DFID and UNICEF, and the Bank will work
closely with them. The Bank will also learn from the experience of strong urban women's
groups in states such as Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. This will include exploring sustainable
financing mechanisms to enhance access of the poor to financial services, including credit for
housing and community infrastructure.

104. Portfolio performance. T he India portfolio is the largest in the Bank, comprising in
February 2001, 73 projects with a commitment of US$12.1 billion, net of cancellations
(Table 4). The undisbursed balance was US$7.6 billion at the start of FY01. The
disbursement ratio remains low compared to some of the other large borrowers (e.g., it is
more than 20% in the case of China, Mexico and Indonesia), but is increasing and is likely to
exceed 18% this fiscal year.

105. Portfolio performance has been average by the Bank's standards of the 1990s.
Improved portfolio performance in the second half of the 1990s is also reflected in the
declining ratio of problem projects, which fell from 20% in FY96 to 7% in FY00 (Table 5).
However, the last year saw a deterioration in quality with the percentage at the start of FY01
rising to 13%. This reversal was in part due to serious and unexpected fiscal problems in a
number of states, which led to substantialinterruptions in the flow of funds and significant
inaction in filling vacant posts. Other persisting problems that have affected project quality
include frequent changes of senior counterpart staff, inability of governments to comply with
covenants related to increased cost recovery, and weak capacity for procurement and
financial rnanagement. These problems are now being addressed and as of January 1, 2001,
the India portfolio had only 4 (6%) problem projects. This improvement needs to be
sustained to confirm the turn-around in portfolio perfornance.

The Bank's portfolio management plan focuses on three main components. First, it

considered at risk, and closer monitoring of supervision reports and portfolio indicators. The
aim is to improve implementationby early identification of problems and timely
restructuring, with cancellation being the measure of last resort. Second, to improve future
project performance, design and implementationreadiness will be reviewed even more
carefully, with increased attention on mobilization of user groups, up-front institutional
actions, and procurement readiness. Finally, to tackle the underlying problems, of which
poor project performance is a symptom,the plan includes broad-based actionsjointly with
government on three critical areas:
* Flow of funds: innovative approaches include thorough fiscal assessments in focus states
and a pilot trial of direct flow of funds to project entities without routing through state
governments;
*

Staffing: project supervision efforts are responding more quickly to restructure project
activities with persistent staffing problems, while deep-seatedinstitutional personnel
practices are being addressed through broad-based dialogue on civil service reform; and

*

Procurement: time limits on bid validity are being more rigorously monitored to weed
out extreme examples of procurement inefficiency. This has been complemented by indepth reviews of procurement practices and problems at national and state levels,
developmentof improved procedures, and training.

LENDINGPROGRAM

107. Outcomes from the last CAS. The last CAS was discussed by the Board in January
1998 and a progress report was reviewed in February 1999. The last CAS set out two lending
scenarios: (i) a base case scenario of US$3 billion a year (US$2.1 billion IBRD, US$0.9
billion IDA), driven primarily by the Government's request to increase IBRD lending in
support of India's program of accelerated growth and poverty reduction; and (ii) a low case of
US$1.2-2 billion with a 50/50 IBRD/IDA blend, that would have reflected a significant
deterioration in macroeconomic conditions. As a consequence of the nuclear tests conducted
by India in May 1998, Board consideration of four projects, for a total of US$1.2 billion of
IBRD/IDA lending was postponed indefinitelyat the request of several Board members, and
with the concurrence of the Indian authorities. Until April 2000, no India project in
infrastructure and energy (other than one for power sector reforms) was approved by the
Board. Actual lending over the last three years has therefore averaged only US$780 million
for IBRD and US$870 million for IDA, below the average level for the preceding three years.
108. Lending scenarios. Given its poverty and size, India is under-served by the global aid
community; in fact, the overall aid budget to India has been declining in absolute terms.
However, a number of bilateral agencies are currently expanding activities in India, in
recognition of India's importance to meeting global poverty targets (UK, Netherlands).
DFID (UK), for example, is planning to at least double disbursements to India over the next
three years.
109. Since the last CAS, there has been increased demand for Bank lending from the new
reformningstates and sectors. The Indian authorities have recently requested a significant
increase in the Bank program to US$4 billion a year, with US$2.5-2.8 billion IBRD and
US$1.2-1.5 billion IDA. Clearly, both demand and need for Bank financing currently far
exceed our maximum possible response level. Given the current project pipeline, it is highly
unlikely that more than about US$3 billion IBRD/IDA lending per year will be achieved in
the immediate future. For these reasons, and to ensure prudent medium-term exposure

management, for the coming CAS period, the same base case lending of US$3 billion per
year (about US$2.15 billion IBRD; US$850 million IDA for FY02-04) is planned as in the
last CAS, as well as low case lending levels of about US$ 1.5-2.0 billion per year (about
US$1.0-1.5 billion IBRD, and a core IDA program of US$400-500 million). A base case
lending program is attached as Annex B3. The total volume of IBRD/IDA lending in recent
years and during the coming CAS period is presented in Figure 2. The Bank's proposed
response to the recent Gujarat earthquake, currently under preparation (para. 87), would be
additional.

111. Self-activating triggers. Since a significant volume of the Bank's lending program is
linked to basic structural reform, if states are unable to sustain fiscal reform, or carry through
with power sector reforms, for example, the Bank lending program will automatically shrink.
The self-activating triggers which will govern the Bank's program in areas such as power

Page 35

India: Country Assistance Strategy

sector, fiscal and governancereforms, are quantifiedin Table 6, which shows the extent to
which lending will fall if various reforms do not proceed. If power reforms do not
materialize, for example, lendingwill automaticallyfall by US$370million a year on average
over the next three years, as five new policy-basedpower sector projects get put on hold. If,
in addition,fiscal reforms go off track, an additionalUS$700 million of lending will be
affected, as some seven adjustmentloans will have to be put on hold. The combined effect
would be a reduction of someUS$ 1.1 billion from the base case scenario, with both EBRD
and IDA well below their base case levels. Table 7 below summarizesthe base and low case
annual lending scenariosthat would result from the application of these state triggers.

112. Global triggers. In addition to these self-activatingtriggers, which will automatically
shift India between the base case and the low case, India's fiscal and external situation,
progress in national reforms as well as performance of the portfolio, will also be monitored in
deciding overall lending volumes. Key indicators in this regard will include:
* Improvement in the fiscal balance (as indicated by consolidated public sector debt below
85% of GDP, and a decline in the GeneralGovernmentdeficit) and absence of serious
external deterioration(as indicated by net internationalreserves below 50 % of the
money base).
*

Progress in national reforms as indicated by advances in: trade (eliminationof
quantitativerestrictionsand reduction in average tariffs), banking (reduction in
govemment's stake in the stock of public banks), deregulationof the economy (gradual
exemption of the small-scalereservation limit in export-orientedactivities, and
deregulationof agriculture),and privatization of public enterprises.

*

Maintenanceof an acceptable level of portfolio performnance:percentage of problem
projects not to rise above 15% and disbursement ratio not to fall below 17%.

India: CountryAssistance Strategy

Page36

113.
The self-activating and global triggers highlighted above are of course interrelated. If
India is unable to reduce power sector subsidies or advance state-level fiscal reforms, it will
not be possible for the country to sustain improvements in its basic macro indicators.
Successful execution of the Bank Group base case program is thus expected to assist India in
realization of its basic macroeconomic as well as developmental goals, even though the
results in terms of macro indicators may only be apparent with a lag. Should a case arise in
which the self-activating triggers are satisfied, but not the global triggers, then the Bank will
proceed with its support for structural and state reforms, but cut back on the planned lending
for infrastructure projects, especially roads.

114. IDA allocation and blend. India's low per capita income of US$440 falls well
below the IDA cut-off of US$885. More importantly, India is clearly central to achievement
of the IDA mission of poverty reduction. As Box 1 shows, the international goals for poverty
reduction cannot be achieved without significant improvements in India. The current IDA
allocation to India is, however, only about US$850 million a year. At about 80 US cents per
capita per year, it compares very poorly with the average of about US$7.6 per capita for most
other IDA recipients, and US$10 for countries with country performance ranked equal to that
of India (i.e., ranked in the upper performance quintile). India's use of IDA is directed
towards achievement of the international development goals, mainly for education, health and
anti-poverty or social protection projects, largely in rural areas. In the base case, the Bank
will also use about one-third of IDA for blending programmatic adjustment lending to
improve the enabling environment, without which sustained advances in poverty reduction
will be impossible. The Bank's work in all of these areas was regarded as satisfactory by the
recent CAE. Finally, to preserve India's creditworthinessand ensure prudent IBRD exposure
management, IBRD lending cannot much exceed US$2 billion. A substantial IDA allocation
is therefore crucial to enabling the Bank Group to achieve the base case lending scenario of
US$3 billion. A further increase to US$4 billion, as desired by Government of India, would
require an even larger allocation than assumed in this document. For these reasons, a
continued level of substantial IDA resources, at least at the current levels, is well justified.
115. As shown in Table 6 above, IDA lending will be linked to structural reforms and
unsatisfactory progress in reforms will lead to a substantial reduction of IDA lending, though
a core IDA program of about US$400-500 million for the social sectors and direct poverty
alleviation projects is expected to be maintained. In the base case, the IBRD/IDA blend will
harden to 70:30, with the absolute IDA volume maintained at the current level. However,
subject to overall resource availability and needs, India's allocation could be increased given
the country's importance for global poverty reduction.
NON-LENDINGSERVICES

117.

Non-lending services will be used in three different ways (for details, see Annex B4):

To meet the Bank's due diligence requirements at both the national and the state level.
Over the last CAS period, heavy investments were made in the area of due diligence
AAA, including:
Completion of two nationwide poverty assessments, and work on a number of statelevel poverty assessments/notes.
Completion of a comprehensive, poverty-focused Structural and Social Policy Review.
Completion of a Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) jointly with the IMF,
and a banking report.
Completion of public expenditure reviews for the 5 states in which the Bank is active.

India: CountryAssistance Strategy

Page37

Drafting of a national procurement assessment, now under discussion with
Government, and being followed up by state-level assessments.
Initiation of work on financial accountability.
During the coming CAS period, it is planned to update the set of due diligence AAA.
*

Second, in conjunction with lending, to bolster the effectiveness of Bank support - for
example, at the state-level, regular public expenditure reviews and analyses of growth,
poverty, service delivery, financial accountability, etc.

* Third, to promote capacity building and knowledge sharing, in cases where it is
important to open the dialogue on development and poverty reduction challenges, e.g., in
poor non-reforming states, or where policy reforms are required without a corresponding
need for financial assistance (e.g., financial sector, macroeconomnicdialogue with Gol).
The Bank Group will employ various tools to develop and disseminate knowledge: from
short pieces of sector work to formal pieces of analytical and advisory work, technical
assistance,conferences and workshops. Workshops and conferences, to be organized in
collaboration with the World Bank Institute, will be used to facilitate the national debate
on economic reform and to disseminate domestic and international experience.

B. IFC PORTFOLIO AND PROGRAM
118. India is IFC's 5th largest exposure. As of January 31, 2001, IFC's held portfolio in
India consisted of investments in 68 companies, with total exposure of US$668 million for
IFC's own account and US$100 million for B-loan participants. The current interest
collection rate on the loan portfolio is 82%. Total arrears are currently some US$67 million.
Loan loss reserves represent 16% of the disbursed loan portfolio. Equity loss reserves
represent 29% of the disbursed equity portfolio. This below-average portfolio quality is due
to the poor performance of four companies in steel and textiles. Despite the potential losses
from these four investments, EFC'soverall equity performance in India has been strong, with
unrealized capital gains currently forecast at US$84 million.
119. With improvements in the business climate, progress on policy issues, and easing of
the lending restrictions imposed after India's nuclear tests, IFC has begun to reverse the trend
of under-investment in India. On current trends, IFC approvals are expected to total around
US$1.0-1.5billion over the next three years compared to approximately US$300 million in
the period FY98-00. However, future investment volumes depend upon further progress in
key policy reforms, particularly to open up opportunitiesfor private investment in
infrastructure, and continued liberalization of the investment and trade regime.
120. IFC investments will mainly be concentrated in infrastructure,the financial sector
(including wholesaling of funds to SMEs) and mid-size manufacturing and service
companies. As IFC's experience in the social sectors builds up, it also plans to invest more in
health and education. There is a strong demand for equity, particularly from mid-size
companies and financial institutions where IFC has an important structuring role. However,
demand for foreign-currencyloans is limited. For this reason, IFC has recently arranged a
first swap facility which will support up to US $300 million of local currency products, and
plans to replicate this facility with other counterparts. With these facilities in place, local
currency products are expected to account for a significant proportion of new IFC lending.
IFC will also make greater use of guaranteeproducts, which help mobilize resources from
local capital markets, thus contributing both to capital market development and to direct
project financing.

Page38

C. MIGA PROGRAM
121. At present, MIGA has no exposure in India. In an effort to increase MIGA's
exposure in India, and to facilitate potential foreign direct investments, both inwards and
outwards, MIGA conducted an extensive marketing tour of four cities in India in FY2000.
This effort will be followed up with more visits in which relevant public and private sector
institutions will be targeted. MIGA expects high demand for its guarantee activities once
infrastructure sectors, such as energy, telecommunication,transportation and water, have
been restructured. MIGA's per-project limit of up to US$200 million, its ability to syndicate
additional insurance on the private market, as well as providing guarantees against Breach of
Contract, position the Agency very well to facilitate infrastructure investments into India.

D. OPERATIONAL DECENTRALIZATION
122. Implementation of the CAS since 1997 has necessitated a major decentralization of
operations. In 1997,decentralization of the World Bank India program was initiated by the
transfer of country management to the Delhi office, and the gradual delegation of operational
responsibilities to an expanded team based in Delhi. As shown in Table 8 below, there has
been a substantial increase in the lending projects and supervision projects handled by
national staff over the last three years. This is the result of the hiring of younger national
staff from world class organizations who are more client-focussed, cost-conscious, adaptable,
and have brought in fresh ideas which have resulted in significant changes in the work
culture. In terms of diversity, the present male/female ratio in staff level E and above is 2:1 as
compared to a ratio of 6:1 in 1996.

123. A parallel decentralization of operations was implemented in IFC over the same
period, with the aim to combine IFC's global knowledge with improved understanding of the
local environment and client needs. To this end, a regional hub office was opened in Delhi in
1992 to serve India, Bangladesh, Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka. In 1996, responsibility for
processing and supervision of IFC investments in the region was partly decentralized to the
hub. The Regional Director relocated from Washington, and staff numbers and skill profiles
were enhanced through local recruitment; about 40% of EFC'sSouth Asia region staff are now
based in India. As a result, there has been a significant increase in the number of projects
which are task managed from the Delhi and Mumbai offices of IFC. As against 4 projects in
FY96, projects managed from India have gone up to 16 in FY01.

E. RISK MANAGEMENT
POLITICAL AND PROGRAM RISKS

124. The main risk associated with the CAS is the risk of reform derailment, which could
lead to a growth slowdown. Many of the reforms the Bank Group is supporting, especially at
the state level, have short term social costs and are politically controversial (para. 47).
Although there is clearly a growing momentum for comprehensive fiscal and sectoral reforms
to address the growing economic and fiscal crisis at the state level that seems irreversible
over the longer term, a return to the competitive populism that was the major factor leading to
the current crisis in the short run is not impossible. Even if the reform programs continue,
there may be political opposition to the Bank's involvement.
125. There are a number of measures which will mitigate these risks. The program of
support to the focus states is self-adjustingto this risk: substantial lending to the focus states
will continue only as long as the reforms do (para. 111). To encourage strong local
ownership and political support, governmentsin reforming states are tabling policy papers
which outline their reform programs for debate and consensus building at the local assembly
before they are proposed to the Bank for support. The Bank will advise and support clients to
improve their communication strategies with the general population to gain popular support
for the reforms. These mitigating factors notwithstanding, the risk of reform derailment
remains a serious one.
126. Success in a few states can also bring about increased disparity among the states, or
within states, which may be unacceptable in the country, especially with its strong tradition of
egalitarianism. Consistent with our overarching objective of poverty reduction, the Bank
Group is mnitigatingthis risk by giving priority to the poorer states in our assistance. While
this is consistent with the Bank Group's overall objective in the country, it should be
recognized that this element of the strategy increases the risk of poor performance, as many
of the poorest states suffer from the most serious problems of governance and
mismanagement.
127. There are also portfolio risks in this CAS period. First, there is the risk that the
recent fiscal deterioration will go unchecked, and lead to even worse project disbursement
and performance, even though a program has been initiated to improve the performance of
the portfolio (para. 106). Second, the effectiveness of community-based rural interventions
after project closure remains unproven. Do community groups continue to meet, to save, and
to maintain newly-created assets, or is the social capital created quickly dissipated once the
flow of funds dries up? This issue is already the subject of sector work, and it will require
more attention in the coming years. Third, some projects carry with them social and
environmental risks. Projects in India come under very close scrutiny from civil society
(domestic and international) and the media. The Bank Group's objective is to help its clients
not only comply with the Bank Group's safeguard directives, but also develop the necessary
regulations and institutions to improve the social and environmental compliance performance
of all projects (para. 69). In addition, the Bank Group's communications strategy aims to
improve the information flow about compliance issues, and to tackle misunderstandings
which often arise in respect of contentious projects.
128. Finally, the Bank Group faces a common risk in all large countries like India, and
that is the risk of becoming less relevant. This is clearly not the situation at present.

India: Country Assistance Strategy

Page 40

Feedback indicates that India, at all levels of the government, private sector and civil society,
considers the Bank Group to be a major player in the country's effort to reduce poverty. But
as the OED's Country Assistance Evaluation concluded, the Bank only played a marginal
role in this important country over much of the past decade, and probably much before that as
well. The risk of becoming less relevant remains real. Basing the Bank Group's assistance
strategy on the governrment'sown poverty reduction strategy helps mitigate this risk, as does
the use of extensive consultations in the preparation of this CAS.
CREDITANDEXPOSURE
RISKS
129. India's credit risks are fairly small, in spite of its large fiscal deficit. This assessment
is based on the experience of the past decade, on the growing consensus to introduce
measures to strengthen the independence of the monetary authority and on the gradual
strengthening of the domestic banking system. All of India's governments after 1991 have
been consistent in their efforts at reducing the size of the public sector external debt,
increasing the maturity structure of the external debt, increasing the level of foreign
international reserves (Table 2), and maintaining a relatively flexible management of the
exchange rate. As a result, India's external position is strong and most creditworthiness
indicators are trending in the right direction. The resilience of India's economic growth and
its external position in the face of both the East Asia crisis and the recent steep oil price hike
suggests that the country is able to absorb external shocks. In addition, a draft Fiscal
Responsibility Act is pending, which will increase the independence of the Reserve Bank of
India (RBI). At the same time, the supervisory capacity of the RBI over the banking system
is improving, banking regulation is following international standards and the government's
stake in commercial banking is falling. Therefore, it is likely that India's external position
will remain strong and creditworthiness high. This is consistent with the international capital
markets' perception of India's credit risks; bonds of top grade Indian corporates (which in the
absence of any sovereignpapers serve as sovereign proxy) are trading at spreads over U.S.
Treasuries close to investment grade bonds.
130. The main macroeconomic risk stems from weak political consensus to introduce
expenditure reducing reforms and tax revenue collection increasing measures so as to
gradually reduce the fiscal deficit and curb the increasing trend in the consolidated public
sector debt to GDP ratio. If such scenario unfolds, an increase in the average rate of inflation
and a transitory fall in the rate of economic growth is likely. However, the probability of a
balance of payments crisis is small. Should a scenario of slow pace in structural reform and
continuation of high fiscal deficits occur, the triggers identified in para. 111 are
comprehensive enough to allow a reassessment and mitigate possible risks.
131. As of December 31, 2000 IBRD exposure to India was US$7.2 billion, its sixth
largest, and 5.9 percent of the total IBRD portfolio. Under the base case scenario outlined in
para. 109, India's IBRD exposure is projected to increase to US$9.2 billion at end-FY04 and
annual net flows (disbursements less repayment of principals) would average about US$660
million over this period: this would reverse the pattern of the last five years of negative net
flows. Despite a projected increase in exposure, IBRD debt service as a share of exports of
goods and non-factor services and as a share of total public debt service is projected to
remain within EBRD's prudential guidelines. Preferred creditor debt service as a share of
total public debt service is also projected to remain within IBRD's guidelines.

Note: The full line illustrates the Base Case (comnmitments
for FY02-06 of about US$2 billion; FY07-09 between
US$1.3 and US$15 billion thereafter) under the assumptions described in Annex 7.

132. At the end of the CAS period, IBRD exposure to India would remain well below
EBRD's single borrower exposure guideline of US$13.5 billion. However, to ensure that this
guideline does not become a binding constraint on IBIRDassistance to India in the future it
would be necessary to manage exposure carefully. Exposure projections show that keeping
IBRD annual commitments at about US$2 billion over the period FY02-06 would require a
cutback in conmmitmentsthereafter to prevent breaching the exposure guideline. For
example, under the scenario shown in Figure 3, IBRD annual commitments would have to be
reduced from US$2 billion in FY06 to US$1.2 billion in FY10 to keep exposure below the
guideline and leave some headroom to assist in the event of a crisis.
133. Alternative disbursement and cancellation assumptions were used to produce an
upper and a lower bound (dotted lines in Fig. 3) to the base case projection. As the dotted
lines indicates, the cutback in lending may not be as severe if disbursements are slower than
projected, or cancellations are larger. Conversely,faster disbursements and smaller
cancellations could result in a faster buildup of exposure and require a larger cutback in
lending past FY06. These projections are also sensitive to the composition of adjustment and
investment lending, and to the currency composition of India's IBRD debt. Commitments are
also dependent on policy reforms and satisfactoryproject performance. During the current
CAS period, Operations and Finance will continuously monitor implementation of the
lending program.

Listening to India's Poor

Voices of the Poor, the Bank-sponsored multi-country exercise of listening to the poor, was undertaken in
India by PRAXIS -(Institution for ParticipatoryPractices) in the two states of Bihar and Andhra Pradesh.
What follows below highlights a few points from PRAXIS' summary of findings. For the full text, see
www.worldbank.org/poverty.

Defining Poverty & Trends
*
*

The poor define well-being primarily using four criteria: livelihood security, food security, ownership
characteristics and value/respect in society.
There appear to be improvements in the overall well-being of poor households and individuals, with a
higher concentration of resources in the hands of the better off.

Opportunity & Security
* Lack of education and employment opportunities were cited as common causes of poverty in nearly all
villages visited. More and more of India's poor see education as an important prerequisite for better
employment opportunities.
* Many respondents cited concerns with the quality and regularity of teaching in public elementary
schools. In fact, in nearly all villages surveyed, the key concern raised by poor respondents had to do
with education services provided by the Government.
* Health expenditures were cited as a major cause of poverty, and these expenditures kept many of the
poor essentially trapped below the poverty line.
* Health services were inaccessible and of low quality in most locations, particularly in remote tribal
areas. This explains the popularity of traditional healers and birth attendants in the remote villages.
* Single women, in particular widows, were identified to be the most vulnerable people in a community.
Empowerment
*
*

The interventions of non-governmentorganizations have made a significant difference to the lives of
the poor in extending services towards meeting basic needs like health, education and savings.
Although the government services were recognized as very important, they were criticized as well for
inefficiency.

*

Women who work outside the household are still responsible for looking after their own household and
extensive domestic responsibilities, reaffirming the "double burden". In many of the sites visited, the
level of domestic violence was believed to have decreased over the years.

India: Reducing Poverty, Accelerating Development
Structural & Social Policy Review (SSPR)1
Executive Summary
This Report is a pilot in the World Bank's new approach to country economic reports, embodying the
Bank's Comprehensive Development Framework. Experience worldwide indicates that poverty
reduction and sustainable development require sound macroeconomicpolicies, open trade relations, and
increases in human and physical capital. But sustained development also requires a comprehensive
framework that includes 1) good governance; 2) sound legal, incentive, and regulatory frameworks that
protect property rights, enforce contracts and stimulate competitive markets, 3) a sound financial sector,
adequately regulated and supervised with a basis in internationallyaccepted accounting and auditing
standards; 4) health, education and social services that reach the poor, women and girls effectively; 5)
quality infrastructure and public services to promote rural development and livable cities; and 6) policies to
promote environmental and human sustainability (J. D. Wolfensohn, Address to the 1998 World Bank-IMF
Annual Meetings).
The World Bank's new approach to economic reports provides a medium-term perspective on these
elements and on the economy's potential vulnerabilities, including those in the short-run. Given the
framework's breadth, this Report's coverage is limited to the most important issues. In other areas, it
points out directions for further analysis. The Report begins with a chapter on reducing poverty - the
yardstick against which development is measured and the World Bank's principal concern. It is followed
by a chapter on human development, which is both an indicator of poverty reduction and a way out of
poverty. Chapter 3 focuses on the Indian states, which are key actors in human development and
infrastructure provision, as well as in regulation and governance. Chapter 4 deals with governance issues, a
major concern of the World Bank because of its links to poverty reduction and development. The next
three chapters deal with ways to increase growth and its poverty reducing content through improvements in
a) infrastructure; b) the incentive and regulatory framework to encourage efficiency and labor demand - a
key element in poverty reduction; and c) the financial system and corporate governance. Chapter 8 deals
with recent developments, the sustainabilityof growth and ways to reduce vulnerability to macroeconomic
crises that hurt the poor. Finally, Chapter 9 provides a brief forecast of India's prospects and sumrmarizes
policies that would accelerate poverty reduction and sustained development. The Report's discussion of
agriculture (in Chapter 6) - a sector critical for poverty reduction that is still of major importance for the
economy - summarizes the extensive analysis in the World Bank report India: Towards Rural
Development and Poverty Reduction. The unifying theme for this Report is thus accelerating poverty
reduction and sustained development.
Progress and Problems in Poverty Reduction
Steady Progress since Independence. India is an ancient civilization with a proud history. It is one of the
world's largest and most heterogeneous countries. Prior to Independence, India suffered from frequent,
devastating famines and secular stagnation. Hence, poverty reduction and agriculture were central themes
of India's founding fathers. Uplifting the poor and integrating them into the mainstream is a recurrent
theme of India's Five Year Plans. Universal access to education is enshrined in the Constitution. India has
established a wide array of anti-poverty programs and much of India's thinking on poverty has been
mainstreamed internationally. India has successfullyeliminated famines and severe epidemics. It has
made progress in reducing poverty and in its social indicators, which at the time of Independence in 1947

were among the world's worst. Its vibrant democracy and free press have been major factors in these
achievements.
Poverty incidence began to decline steadily in the mid-1970s, which roughly coincided with a rise in
growth in GDP and agriculture. Since 1980, India's 5.8% p.a. trend GDP growth is the highest among
large countries outside East Asia. Empirical analyses suggest that agricultural growth and human
development were key factors in the decline in poverty across states (Chapter 1). However, the
development strategy of the 1970s and 1980s, based on an extensive system of protection, regulation, and
public sector presence in the economy, and on worsening fiscal deficits in the 1980s, proved unsustainable.
Quick Recovery from 1991 Crisis. The 1991 balance of payments and fiscal crisis was met by stabilization
and reforms that opened-up the economy, reduced the public sector's role, and liberalized and strengthened
the financial sector over the next few years. The policies generated a surprisingly quick recovery and then
an unprecedented three consecutive years of 7.7% p.a. average growth, led by increases in productivity at
the macroeconomic level and a booming private sector. The 3.3% p.a. agricultural growth during the 1990s
has been about the same as in the 1980s and much higher than the declining rate of population growth,
currently estimated at about 1.6% p.a. (Chapter 8).
Improvement in social indicators, including gender related indicators, has continued in the 1990s. For
example, literacy rates continue to rise and infant mortality rates continue to fall. Life expectancy at birth
has increased, as have school enrollments. Gaps between male and female access to social services are
diminishing.
Sluggish Poverty Reduction in Recent Years. Despite the improvements in human development and the
higher GDP growth in the mid-1990s, India's household sample surveys suggest that poverty reduction has
been sluggishrecently. In the early 1990s, poverty worsened following the stabilization (correction) of the
unsustainablepolicies of the 1980s, a poor harvest and a decline in food availability (Tendulkar). Soon,
poverty began to fall again and by 1993-94 was somewhat below the 1987 level. However, from 1993-94
until 1997 (the last available survey), improvement has been limited in the rural areas which contain over
70% of the poor. Moreover, analysis suggests that the large poor states in the north and east, containing
40% of India's population, have lagged in reducing poverty since the late 1970s (Chapters 1 and 3).
The estimated slowdown in the overall reduction of poverty may merely reflect one of India's many
statistical inconsistencies - the estimates of consumptionand foodgrains consumption in the national
accounts suggest much faster consumption growth than the sample surveys, while the surveys suggest little
worsening of distribution. The need to improve the consistency and quality of these,and other statistics, in
order to provide a firmer basis for policy-making,is a major recommendation of this Report.
Despite Achievements, Significant Challenges Ahead. More worrisome is the possibility that growth
became less potent in reducing poverty in the 1990s. Further work is needed on this complex issue.
Nonetheless, the characteristics of agricultural growth in the 1990s; the slowdown of growth in the poor
states; and the problems of infrastructure, social services and poverty programs, especially in the poorer
states which are linked to their increasing fiscal problems, poor incentive frameworks and weaknesses in
governance and institutions, are all problems that may explain the lack of progress in reducing rural poverty
(Chapters 1, 2, 3 and 8. Note that statements made regarding individual states or the states' GDP as a
group refer to the old (1980-81 based) GDP accounts; once they are re-based, like national GDP, to the new
(1993-94 based) accounts, the growth rates of states could be different from what the old accounts show,
since the new GDP accounts include a much higher estimate of national agricultural output.).
Agriculture's average growth has remained roughly constant since 1980 according to the new series of
GDP. However, productivity growth in the sector seems to be slowing, even in the Punjab and Haryana,
where some analysts suggest that environmental issues are a concern. Further, agricultural growth in some

India: Country Assistance Strategy

Annex 2
Page 3 of 10

of the poorer states seems to have lagged. Public spending on agriculture has focused on subsidies, which
lead to inefficiencies and environmental problems and at best have limited impact on poverty. The implicit
and explicit subsidies have crowded-out public investment and social spending in Governments' budgets
and substantially worsened the fiscal problems of states. While private investment in agriculture has
increased, to some extent this reflects inefficiencies and distortions that are partly related to the subsidies,
such as the purchase of pumps to reach deep aquifers and generator sets to run them when free, low quality
power fails. Moreover, the limited growth in agriculturalproductivity may also reflect the limited
deregulation, which has left many distortions in the sector. For example, the restrictions on domestic and
international agricultural trade contribute to occasional, sharp transitory increases in prices, which hurt the
poor (Chapters 3, 6, and 8).
The poorer states have lower GDP growth, not just weak agricultural growth. Partly, of course, this reflects
their structure - agriculture is a large percentage of their GDP. However, the poor states' lower growth
also reflects differences in initial conditions and state-level policies. The poorer states' problems in
infrastructure, human development, and, in some cases, governance, have limited their ability to take full
advantage of the post-1991 reforms. Moreover, catching-up is a problem because of their increasingly
severe fiscal problems - in the late 1980s the states began unsustainable increases in spending and large
untargeted subsidies (explicit and implicit) that have never been adjusted, which has led to a large, costly
debt build-up. Indian states are constitutionally prevented from external borrowing and limited in their
domestic borrowing by the Central Government. Nonetheless, several states, including some of the
poorest, now face unsustainable debt service obligations, mainly to the Central Government, which in turn
had borrowed to fund these loans. Infrastructure and social spending have slowed in most states as a
consequence of the high debt service particularly in the highly indebted and poorer states. The states'
problems have worsened in the last two years, with the cascading down of the excessive central public
sector wage settlement of 1997. (Chapters 2 and 3).
Institutional weaknesses and governance issues exacerbate the lack of funds (Chapters 2 and 4). For
example, not only are teacher-pupil ratios very low, teachers' absenteeism is common. Numbers working
in employmentprograms or attending school appear to be much less in surveys than in official statistics for example, in 1995-96, the NSS showed gross attendance ratios of 85% versus the Department of
Education's gross enrolment ratio of 104%. Large fractions of the poverty funds go to administrative costs
or are diverted, leaving less for the poor. For example, a study in UP suggests that under the new, targeted
public distribution system much of the grain that reached the public distribution centers went to the poor,
but that there was a 40% shortfall between off-take and what reached the distribution centers. (Kriesel and
Zaidi).
Thus despite its many achievements, India faces significant challenges and needs to take some difficult
political decisions to realize its potential. Concerted policy action is needed to lift the more than 300
million poor, 34% of the population and increasingly concentrated in the poorer states, out of poverty.
Better and more education and health spending is needed to provide better access for the poor, females, and
other disadvantaged groups and improve basic services across the board. For example, major challenges in
reducing poverty and getting India's population ready for the demands of the 2 1St century, are raising the
literacy rate from the current 62% (50% for females); enrolling the over 30 million children, mostly poor,
who are out of school; and increasing the overall average years of quality schooling. In addition,
inequalities faced by women in participating fully in the political, legal and economic systems need to be
addressed. The decline in infrastructure spending needs to be reversed, to increase the rate and spread of
growth and to meet urban needs that will rise as the 73% of the population that still live in rural areas shift
to the cities. Improvements at the state-level, particularly improved service delivery in the poorest states,
will be critical in meeting these challenges. At the national level, implementation of the often discussed
second phase of reforms, to complete the external and internal deregulation of goods and factor markets,
will speed the growth of better paying jobs.

The East Asian countries, despite the recent crisis, still have a much lower poverty incidence and better
social indicators than India. For example, Indonesia, which in the mid-1960s had a similar per capita
income to India and which was the hardest hit by the East Asian crisis, has a literacy rate of 80% and less
than 20% of its population were below the poverty line in 1998(World Bank 1999a). Moreover, except for
Indonesia, the crisis countries are rebounding surprisinglyrapidly, reflecting their strong underlying base of
infrastructure and human development.
Potential Problems in Accelerating Poverty Reduction, Sustaining Growth
The East Asian experience of the 1970s and 1980s, and the differential experience of India's states, suggest
that India needs to get back to a higher growth path, which is also more effective at reducing poverty
through improved public spending and a strengtheningof incentives, institutions and governance,
particularly in the poorer states. To make a significant dent in poverty, growth needs to be at least
maintained in India's high growth states and increased significantly in the poorer states.
India's Future Growth and Poverty Reduction. India's growth of 6% in 1998-99 was one of world's best.
However, it mainly reflected good harvests; all major non-agriculturalsectors grew less than in 1997-98
when overall GDP growth was 5%. The reversion back to the average post-1980 growth trend during the
last two years may partly reflect a sluggishness related to the shake-outof excess capacity and partly the
slowing world economy. However, another important factor in slowing growth is probably the slowing of
reforms, along with a worsening of the fiscal deficit and rises in tariffs - reforms that had earlier
contributed to higher productivity, a higher share of world trade, and rapid growth (Chapters 6 and 8 and
Annex 8.1). Also, the delivery of social services and anti-povertyprograms, necessary to include India's
poor in the growth process and largely a state function, would have benefited not only from higher funding
but improved institutions and governance.
Indeed these and other issues raised above raise concerns about maintaining even the current pace of
development. Current rates of investment have supported GDP growth 5-6% p.a. in the last two years, but
can continue to do so provided the productivity of resources continues to increase in the macroeconomic
sense. However, the deterioration of infrastructure (Chapter 5); the slower pace of reforms (Chapters 6, 8)
and the resulting uncertainty for investors; the lack of agricultural deregulation (Chapter 6); the still-low
indicators of human development; and the governanceand institutional issues, particularly in the social
sectors (Chapters 2, 4), all pose potential problems for the growth of productivity in an economy-wide
sense.
Large Central and State Deficits, related to Large Explicit and Implicit Subsidies. Another major issue
for sustained development is the large General Government (consolidated Central and State) deficit.
India's fiscal deficit has been among the world's largest and in 1998-99 it deteriorated by roughly 2% of
GDP. The consolidated public sector deficit of 9.6% of GDP in 1998-99 was not much lower than the peak
of 10.9% registered in the crisis year of 1990-91. The Center's deficit deteriorated by 0.8% of GDP to
6.5% of GDP in 1998-99 (including net loans to the states) and was far higher than the 5.3% budgeted
figure (all figures exclude disinvestment revenues). The current (revenue) deficit increased to 4% of GDP,
the highest in the decade, meaning India is increasingly borrowing to finance current expenditure.
Meanwhile, the states' combined deficit rose to 4.2% of GDP, the worst deficit ever of the states. (Chapter
8). Reflecting the recent fiscal deterioration, the ratio of Central Government debt to GDP, which fell in
the mid-1990s, has now risen to about 60% of GDP, and has led to comment from the RBI (Report on
Currency and Finance 1998-99, pp. V-12 to V-17). The large and rising fiscal deficit and the large public
sector debt (mostly internal) raises investors' concerns about macroeconomic instability and inflation
(which would hurt the poor), and crowds-out private credit in the banking system.

The 1999-2000 Union Budget projected a cut in the central deficit of 0.9% of GDP. Achieving this target
depends on a substantial rise in tax revenue, and containing revenue expenditure growth to only 9%.
Preliminary data from the first seven months of 1999-2000 suggest taxes are growing slower than projected
and expenditure faster, partly because of support for and lending to the states to finance their high deficits.
The Union Budget also changed the accounting treatment of the growing small saving funding of the states
deficit from a Central Government loan to an item in the "National Small Savings Fund" in the Center's
Public Accounts. This accounting change reduces the Center's deficit figures by about 1.3% of GDP but
leaves the (consolidated) General Government fiscal deficit unchanged. It will be important to pay close
attention to the policy on small savings, as the Center sets the rates and implicitly guarantees the deposits.
A positive fiscal development was the sharp upward adjustment of domestic diesel prices in October 1999,
an attempt to correct for the potential deficit in the oil pool; it also maintained the liberalization of the
sector. The states' and the Public Enterprises' deficits are likely to suffer continued pressure from the
cascading effect of the excessive central wage settlement of 1997 on wages and pensions. As noted, the
interest costs of the debt have increasingly crowded-out infrastructure, maintenance, and social spendingin
central and state budgets.
Implicit and explicit subsidies at the Center and, especially, the state levels are a major factor in the deficit.
The Ministry of Finance estimated these subsidies at over 14% of GDP in 1994-95. In addition to
increasing the deficit, they are distortionary, non-transparent, and at best have uncertain equity
consequences, at worst they are anti-equity. While the states are directly responsible for many of the
subsidies, the Center's funding of the states supports them indirectly. Another structural factor in the deficit
is the tax system, with central taxes declining by over 1.5% of GDP over 1991-98. The growing services
sector is inadequately taxed and agriculture, part of the state tax base, remains outside the system. The tax
base has been widened recently, but nonetheless remains fairly narrow, with under 15 million tax payers.
As various experts have noted, the approach to sharing of taxation revenues, the lack of a full fledged VAT
(including services), and the failure of the states to tax agriculture have complicated fiscal decentralization
and generated tax-based inefficiencies (Chapters 3 and 4). Expenditure management and efficiency could
be improved, as recognized in the last two finance ministers' calls for an Expenditure Reforms
Commission. The civil service is large. Many public enterprises continue to operate at low efficiency in
areas where the private sector could function more effectively and generate more taxable revenues.
Comfortable BOP but Domestic Policies Continue to Constrain Competitiveness. In contrast to the fiscal
situation, India's balance of payments (BOP) remains comfortable. In 1998-99, the balance of payments
strengthened substantially, with the current account deficit improving to 1% of GDP. This improvement
reflected the low oil prices that prevailed for much of the year and a $4 billion drop in non-customs imports
that reduced imports by over 7%. However exports also declined, by 4% in dollar terms, reflecting not
only weak markets but a loss of share of world markets for the second consecutive year. Regarding the
capital account, the Resurgent India Bond raised $4.2 billion despite the turmoil in international markets.
However, foreign direct investment declined and portfolio flows turned negative. The net impact of these
developments was a rise of about $3.9 billion in international reserves (including SDRs and IMF reserves
but not gold), to a comfortable end-fiscal year level of $30.2 billion (7.6 months of imports, and
comfortably larger than potential short term claims). The projection for 1999-2000 is a slight widening of
the current account deficit, to 1.4% of GDP, reflecting continued high oil prices. On the capital account,
increases in portfolio investment (despite the continued low levels of private capital flows worldwide) and
"other" capital inflows which appear strong thus far in 1999, will offset a decline in net long-term
borrowings after the one-time Resurgent India Bond issue in 1998-99. These inflows will finance much of
the larger deficit and permit some increase in reserves, although the reserve cover is likely to decline
marginally to 7.2 months of imports (Chapters 8 and 9). The external debt situation remains comfortable,
and the external debt to GDP ratio as well as the debt to current receipts ratio have fallen steadily since
1992-93. A large proportion of external debt is to multilateral and bilateral lenders and/or is long-term.
Careful monitoring by the Government and changes in the underlying economic factors have led to a

India: CountryAssistance Strategy

Annex 2

Page 6 of JO

substantial fall in short-termdebt, from over $8.5 billion (10% of external debt) in 1991 to an estimated
$4.3 billion (4.4%) in March 1999.
The fundamentals of India's slow export growth lie in the lack of further tariff reform, high infrastructure
and transactions costs, and continued domestic regulations such as small-scale sector reservation and labor
laws that reduce India's comparative advantage in labor intensive products and, consequently, the demand
for labor. As a result, India may find it difficult to take advantage of the next upsurge in world trade and
the international agreementto phase out textile and garment quotas by 2005, and is not well-prepared for
greater competition that will arise from the elimination of remaining quantitative restrictions on imports no
later than April 2001 (of which half, mainly the special import license restrictions, are due to go by April
2000). Indeed, India already faces growing competition from a recovering East Asia. A bright spot in the
current account is the rapid growth of computer service exports, which do not suffer from the anti-export
biases mentioned above, but even they may be hurt if telecom infrastructure lags.
Financial System Remains a Concern. The public sector-dominatedfinancial system is another major
issue impinging on sustained growth and, indirectly, poverty reduction. The financial sector mobilizes
substantial resources but still invests a large part of them in the government debt, in the case of banks about
40% of deposits. This pattern of asset holding by the financial sector does reduce India's susceptibilityto
financial crises but it also reduces credit availability to the private sector. From a macro-economic
standpoint, these large holdings levels of debt are simply the reflection of the long history of high fiscal
deficits and the need for someone to hold the resulting debt; funds can be made available to the private
sector at reasonable cost only as the public debt declines relative to GDP. A second factor raising the cost
of private sector credit is non-performing assets. Non-performing assets are a low fraction of total bank
assets (3% net of provisions) or GDP (under 2%), but are large relative to lending to the private sector (or
to bank capital). The large NPAs in turn require large provisions, another factor pushing up real lending
rates. Regulation and supervision have improved substantially since the 1980s and are largely up to
international standards, but they remain well below the steady evolution of international best practices. The
payments system continues to lag international standards, according to participants in the sector. The
capital markets are deep for a low-income country and improvements have been made - notably the set up
of the electronic National Stock Exchange and the creation of a depository that has reduced transactions
costs by dematerializing an increasing number of shares. Nonetheless, transparency needs improvement,
notably in the activities of the dominant Unit Trust of India and in settlements, to help avoid payments
crises such as hit the Bombay Stock Exchange in June 1998. More fundamentally, accounting, auditing,
and corporate governance also could benefit from improvement to make India a more attractive to domestic
and foreign investors (Chapter 7).
Legal and Environmental Issues. Enforcement of property rights and contracts are increasinglyidentified
by analysts as critical institutional elements in development. Clarity and security of property and land
rights and timely recourse to an efficient legal system are important not only to investors but to sustainable
increases in living standards for the poor. Surveys indicate a respect for India's adherence to the rule of
law and the independence and quality of the judiciary. However, the appellation "justice delayed is justice
denied" is a critical concern, particularly for the poor. The enormous case backlog and the legal processes
can delay decisions 10-20 years. These delays add to the problems of the poor in obtaining protection from
the legal system. All these problems, as well as the bankruptcy and liquidation processes, raise credit costs,
increase non-performing assets (Chapters 4 and 7), hinder good credit allocation and limit the ability of the
poor to use their limited real assets effectively.
Finally, the environmental dimension needs to be kept in mind. The Finance Ministry's 1998-99 Economic
Survey farsightedly included a chapter on environment, which points out the disproportionate burden of
environmental and resource degradation on the poor, a concern which this Report shares. As noted above,
environmental degradation and unsustainable usage of resources, encouraged by subsidies and unclear

India: Country Assistance Strategy

Annex 2
Page 7 of 10

property rights, may be a factor in slowing agricultural growth in some states and a limitation on
improvements in the quality of life generally. Often the poor suffer from the environmental problems
associated with unclear allocation of property rights to clean air, water, etc. The human sustainabilityof
the cities is threatened by water and air pollution, which partly reflects distortionary pricing and partly lack
of funding for public infrastructure (Chapter 8 and Annex 8.2).
A Second Wave of Reforms to Reduce Poverty Faster
All recent Governments have discussed the need for a second wave of reforms to launch India onto a higher
growth path that reduces poverty faster. However, as noted, reforms have slowed, creating some
uncertainty among investors. Many excellent suggestions for reform are contained in such reports as the
Hussain Committee on Small-scale Sector Reservation, the Rakesh Mohan Committee on Infrastructure,
the Tenth Finance Commission on intergovernmentalfinances, the Fifth Pay Commission on downsizing
the civil service, the Tarapore Conmnitteeon the capital account and its implications for the
macroeconomic framework, the NarasimnhamCommittees on the financial sector, the Disinvestment
Commission reports, recent Economic Surveys, RBI Annual Reports, and the 1999 Export-Import Policy.
In addition to these contributions, the comprehensive framework outlined above may provide some
assistance. While a basic consensus on the need for the Second Wave of Reforms has emerged, for
example in the programs of the two major political parties, it needs to be translated into substantive action.
Broadly speaking the reforms would be most effective to the extent they reduce the risk of macroeconomic
instability, increase the access of the poor to human development, improve governance and reduce
distortions and improve the demand for labor. Poorer states in particular will need to enact these reforms to
overcome the initial lags and accelerate development.
Perhaps the most effective, cross-cuttingreform would be cuts in the explicit and implicit subsidies
together with privatization in power to raise the current low collections of user charges (that represents a
major part of the implicit subsidies). Cutting the subsidies would cut the fiscal deficit and thereby reduce
risks of macroeconomic instability and the crowding-out of private borrowers; it would free up public funds
for social and infrastructure spending to help the poor and speed growth; it would encourage private sector
interest in infrastructure; it would reduce distortions and environmental degradation; and it would probably
improve equity (Box 5.2 and Chapter 8). In the petroleum sector, the link that was established between
domestic and international prices with the September 1997 liberalization has been an important factor in
cutting subsidies, and needs to be sustained. Another policy to reduce subsidies that could be enhanced
further is the increasing use of cesses on fuels to fund road infrastructure. Obviously, state governments
will play a major part in cutting power and irrigation subsidies. There have been welcome movements
toward reform in some states, including some of the poorer states such as Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Orissa
and UP. However, state governments are not always prepared to embark on the reform path. In this
context, increasing emphasis on states' performance in Central Government transfers, increasing the
proportion that states borrow directly from markets, and without central guarantees (and reducing State
borrowings from the Center), and limiting the states' ability to ease their hard budget constraint, such as
reducing access to high cost small-savings and limiting guarantees, would provide important incentives for
reform. A welcome development along these lines is the recent use of Memorandums of Understanding to
encourage fiscal discipline between the Ministry of Finance and states that receive extraordinary financing
to ease the impact of the recent hefty pay revision. And, issues of links between Center-State finance and
state performance appropriately form part of the Eleventh Finance Commission's terms of reference.
Realigning Central and State Governments to focus on core public activities would have high social
payoffs. Basic education and health and infrastructureneed better and more public spending to reduce
poverty and speed growth. Withdrawal of Government from non-core activities through faster privatization
(not just sales of minority shares) in manufacturing and service sectors, e.g. airlines and hotels, and

India: Country Assistance Strategy

Annex 2
Page 8 of 10

increased private sector participation in infrastructure, would permit a downsizing, upgrading and focusing
of Government and the civil service on truly public sector activities. It would also increase the current low
returns on capital invested in these areas and raise taxable revenues. It also is worth noting that the current
lack of attention and investment in these sectors is reducing their salability. The improvements in the
budgets from reduced explicit and implicit subsidies and higher taxes from the formerly public enterprises
would permit much needed increases in spending on infrastructure and basic human development at the
Center and state level. At the state-level, the states mentioned above are embarking on much needed
realignments of Government in varying degrees and sectors.
Better and more spending on health and education. Faster poverty reduction cannot be accomplished
without improving the delivery of health and education services. This will involve more effective spending
on elementary education and basic health systems, with better targeting on improving the quality and
quantity of services to the poor and with more public funding to address the unfinished agenda. The
effectiveness of public education and health services in poverty reduction can be improved by focussing on
meeting consumer needs and the holistic needs of children, realigning the role of the state toward primary
education and health, and making efforts to encourage improvements in and better use of private education
and health services.
Governance could be improved in a variety of ways. In the public sector, tax structure and collection, and
expenditure management would benefit from improvement. Effective decentralization - including
improving of state and local institutional capacity and greater "voice", a more efficient sharing of the tax
base across different levels of government, and closer links of costs, revenues and service delivery - would
improve governance, outcomes and inclusion of the poor (Chapter 4). This is particularly the case in
primary health and education delivery that impacts heavily on the opportunities for the poor to escape
poverty. In this regard, it is worth noting that India's decentralization to the third tier of rural and urban
local bodies already has a firm legal basis in the 7 3 rd and 74h Constitutional Amendments (1992).
Effective decentralization and greater deregulation would help to reduce corruption, a.mounting concern of
Central and state governments, as would improving public administration and procedures, incentives and
disincentives, and accountability (Chapter 6). The legal system would benefit from a reduction in delays
and disincentives to frivolous litigation and appeals, which would make legal remedies more accessible to
the poor and help reduce the non-performing assets that burden the financial system and drive up
borrowing costs. The state governments also need to enforce property rights and law and order, to provide
an attractive environment for investment.
Completion of the deregulation of goods and factor markets, notably through deregulation of agriculture,
articulation of a time-bound tariff-reductionprogram, completion of the WTO commitments, and
development of a less negotiated/more rules-based treatment of foreign direct investment, would stimulate
poverty reduction through higher, more labor using growth. It would also help get India ready to take
advantage of the pickup in the world economy and the increased competition, domestic and international
that is developing. Further deregulation of labor markets and the small scale sector would increase the
demand for labor (Chapter 6).
In thefinancial system, India needs to speed up judicial resolution of cases and debt recovery and improve
the bankruptcy and liquidation procedures. Accounting and auditing and financial system regulation and
supervision, though much improved since the 1980s,need to move much closer to the steadily improving
best international practices, especially as the financial system becomes more privatized and links increase
with the international economy (Chapter 7). The RBI also needs to deal more rapidly with weak banks and
prevent their non-performing assets from increasing. Lending to the private sector needs to improve, which
will depend on a reduced fiscal deficit (to reduce crowding out) and better incentives to lend and collect,
including privatization of banks. The payments system lags improvements elsewhere in the financial sector
and would benefit from some quick improvements. Finally, more transparency , such as making the

India: Country Assistance Strategy

Annex 2
Page 9 of 10

massive Unit Trust of India's activities more transparent, reducing settlement times in the capital market,
and improving accounting, auditing and corporate governance, as laid out in the draft Companies Bill,
1998, would help reduce vulnerability and improve the allocation of scarce capital. (Chapter 7).
Improved infrastructureprovision, both public andprivate, would help accelerate growth. The currently
inadequate provision of high quality, reliable, and reasonably priced infrastructure services represents a
major barrier to continued growth of the economy and services to the poor, and to the diffusion of the
benefits of liberalization. The development of infrastructure needs an effective delineation of
responsibilities between the regulator and the policy-maker, and the creation of independent regulators
within a broader restructuring of the sectors. In many sectors, privatization and greater reliance on
competition could improve service delivery in many areas. Above all, infrastructure improvement will
depend on the removal of the implicit and explicit subsidies and a move to remunerative user charges
(Chapter 5).
Circumstances Propitious for Reformnsand Acceleration of Growth
Events at the end of 1999 seem favorable to the initiation of the second wave of reforms. The Central
Government that took office in October 1999 has already made progress by passing legislation to open up
insurance (the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority Bill), liberalizing foreign exchange
regulation (the Foreign Exchange Management Bill), allowing trading in derivatives (the Securities
Contract Regulation (Amendment)Bill), and protecting trade marks (the Trademarks Bill). The
Government enjoys a more comfortable majority than the previous one which will permit it to move
forward more easily on subsidy-cuts (as it demonstrated by implementing a 40% diesel price hike in
October, in spite of pressures for rollback), government realignment, and reform. At the state-level,
reforming governmentsreceived electoral support and non-reforming governments seem to have lost
support. Some of the poorer and most indebted state governments- such as Uttar Pradesh - are embarking
on a path of comprehensive reforms, similar to the economic restructuring launched by the Government of
Andhra Pradesh (that was re-elected in October 1999). These reform efforts are aimed at (a) restructuring
state-level expenditure and improving governance so as to maximize the outcomes achieved by public
spending and private investments in the state; and (b) enhancing the revenue base through tax policy and
administrativereforms and improved cost recovery from publicly provided non-merit goods and services.
These developments suggest that the chances of real reform happening are much brighter than they have
been in the past; if these do occur, then, as this Report suggests, growth could accelerate to the 7.5% and
higher levels of the mid 1990s. India would then have a real opportunity to reduce poverty substantially in
the new millennium.
Issues for Further Analysis
In several places in the Report, gaps in the knowledge base and in country experience have been identified
as issues deserving further analysis and research. Work on these and related issues will be important to
reducing poverty in India.
Some of the issues are fundamental and involve cross-cutting work in various areas, and often these are the
most important issues. These include:
*
*
*

improving the delivery of social services to the poor;
the links between growth, poverty reduction, and governance, especially at the state-level;
the nature, causes and cures of urban poverty;

Other issues involve examination and comparison of policy options, based on experience within India and
internationally. These include:

*

possible policy paths for deeper restructuring of government at all levels, to help "right-structureand,
as necessary, right-size" the state in India;
* decentralization experiences that will be most effective in improving the quality and effectiveness of
the decentralizationprocess in the Indian context (including studies of states' devolution of revenue and
taxing powers to local governments to decentralize services);
* possible paths to fiscal adjustment at the central and state level, taking into account the linkage between
fiscal deficits, growth, and poverty reduction, and drawing on international experiences;
* approaches to corporate restructuring, public and private, and the constraints imposed by the labor
market, drawing on international experience;
* possible paths to privatization of banks, while decreasing the vulnerability of the banking system
through regulation and supervision that approaches best practices and improvements in accounting,
auditing and corporate governance;
* further ways to strengthen institutions and modalities for delivery and repayments of micro-credits and
agricultural loans;
* options before India in the next round of trade negotiations;
* linkages between trade, growth, employment and education.
Finally, as noted in various places in the Report, a key issue for policy-making is improvement in the
quality and consistency of various statistics.

CAE Recommendations
1. To enhance the effectivenessof its assistance, the
Bank should:

Management Response

*

Link the overall lending volumes to fiscal discipline
at the federal level and to progress in structural
reforms in agriculture and the implementation of an
effective rural development strategy, as progress in
these areas is crucial for rural poverty reduction.

We agree with and have benefited from the emphasis the CAE
places on rural development. We are now giving agricultural
policies greater prominence in our dialogue with Gol as well as
in our state assistance strategies in our focus states. Our rural
development work is expanding, our policy dialogue is
intensifying, including through rural policy reviews at the state
level - completed in one state, under preparation in another which allow us to link rural issues to our overall state-level
dialogue.
At the national level, we are stressing simple but critical crosscutting, easily-monitored and verifiable triggers (such as the
fiscal policies, external balance and portfolio performance) as
well as progress on structural reforms, including deregulation of
agriculture.

*

Further concentrate new lending in reforming states,
where an assistance strategy has been agreed with
the state government. Similarly, sectoral lending
volumes should be linked to agreements on sectorspecific policies and institutional frameworks.

Agree. Our policy-based state focus has already been a core
element of our country assistance strategy. The next CAS,
currently under preparation, reaffirms this strategic priority
unambiguously. Likewise, our sectoral lending has been
essentially policy-based; lending volumes will continue to
depend on pursuance of reforms in individual sectors.
Agree. Gol's Economic Survey for FY2001 will contain for the
first time a separate chapter on gender, which will focus on the
status of women and the extent to which women's empowerment
has translated into budgetary commitments. As part of our state
focus, we encourage the states to establish an extensive poverty
monitoring system to track the impact of reforms on the poor and
we design our state assistance strategies with a view to
improving growth prospects -- hence opportunities for the poor -and increasing the quality and quantity of social spending and
other development spending that benefit the poor. Gender
considerations are integral to all our work. To promote gender
equality, we are targeting women in several of our social sector
programs (e.g., education, health), promoting women's
empowerment through our rural development activities,
particularly community empowerment, but also increasingly
through our rural policy reviews, for example, to remove
discrimination against women in respect of property rights.
Finally, we are using gender-desegregated M&E. However more
still remains to be done.

2. The Bank should systematically monitor the poverty
and gender impacts of Bank-assistedprojects and
programs. It should also assist government agencies to do
the same for the overall public expenditure programs.

3. The Bank should strengthen aid coordination on
country assistance strategies and on critical sector
strategies (e.g., agriculture and rural development).
Greater coordination would enhance the effectiveness of
external assistance, and would enable greater selectivity
in the Bank's own programs.

As the CAE notes, most development agencies look to the
Governmentof India and state govemments for aid coordination,
as would be expected under a comprehensive development
framework. However, we agree with the goal of greater
selectivity, and are increasingly working in partnership with
other aid agencies to follow shared principles and identify areas
in which the Bank has a comparative advantage and areas in
which we do not.

A Snapshot of the CAS Consultations
It is difficult to do justice to the richness of the observations which emerged from the India CAS
consultations. Summaries of individual consultations have been prepared and placed on the India CAS web
site - www.worldbank.org/indiacas.Rather than trying to summarize these summaries here, our aim is
simply to give a flavor of the comments and reactions, as well as an idea of how sorne of the input we
received has in fact found its way into the CAS. The focus here is on some of the cross-cutting issues
raised, rather than the very many interesting and useful comments received on specific projects and sectors.
Alignment of Bank with Gol strategy. This comment was made repeatedly, and especially in the context
of consideration of the Bank's legitimacy. In a vibrant democracy such as India, the Bank's legitimacy can
only derive from its acting in support of Governmentpolicies. Partly as a result of these comments, we
have made, in this CAS, a strong effort to align our strategy with the Government's Ninth Five Year Plan
and the Mid-Term Appraisal of the same.
More transparency refocus state selection. Most though not all participants supported the Bank's focus
state strategy (some thought it would punish the country's poorer states). But there was certainly agreement
that the Bank should be more forthcoming as to the criteria by which its focus states are selected. We have
tried to respond to that in this CAS.
What to do aboutpoor, non-reforming states? Even supporters of a focus-state strategy for the Bank
raised the question of how to provide effective assistance to poor, non-reforming states. This question was
particularly acute in the social sectors, where it was felt that assistance should not be withheld to the poor
on account of the poor performance of their government.No consensus was reached on this issue.
Governance as a priority area. Bank involvement in so-called "governance areas" in India is sometimes
seen as overly intrusive. But participants at the CAS consultations stressed the need for the Bank to be
active in these areas if its funds were to be put to good use.
Project governance. It was noted that the Bank preaches good governance, but doesn't necessarily practice
it in the projects it finances. Participants reported that these are, at least sometimes, prepared without
adequate consultations,and it can be difficult to get information about Bank projects, whether at the
national, state or local level. Improving project governance is a challenge taken on in this CAS as part of
our effort to better integrate our projects with our policies.
Selectivity? There was often agreement that the Bank needed to be more selective, 'but very little
agreement as to which sectors we should focus on. In a country as large as India, the best way to achieve
selectivity would seem to be through a focus on a few states. There was, however, considerable demand
for the Bank to reenter the urban developmentsector in a significant manner.
Far, but notfar enough, in social, gender, environment. In the workshops on these topics, there was a
recognition that the Bank had made progress in these areas, but also impatience that it had not gone far
enough, and sometimes frustration that lip-service and tokenism were masquerading for progress. This
CAS responds to the challenge by calling for a mainstreaming of environmental, social and gender
concerns into the overall strategy, rather than their treatment, as in earlier CASs, as add-ons.
Transparencyand dissemination. The consultations were universally well-attended and warmly
welcomed. But there were calls not to treat consultation like a tap which is turned on and off at will, but for
the Bank to be constantly open to outsider opinion. There were also complaints that Bank reports, while of
high quality, are difficult to get hold of, even for government officials. Improving transparency, including
through better dissemination of our reports, is part of the communication strategy fcr the coming CAS
period.

Examples of Bank Partnerships with Bilateral and Multilateral Agencies
Power reform: We have been working in a full partnership since 1994 with DFID in what is arguably India's
most important sectoral reform - the privatization of the power sector. DFID is an active financier of reform in
three of the states in which we are active, Orissa, AP and Haryana.
State reform: Most funding agencies are now following a state-focused approach. Joint presence in a single
state provides many opportunities for partnerships, and state governments are increasingly taking the lead in
bringing funding agencies together.
Gender equality: Gender equality is the first of two themes adopted by the UN in India as part of the UN
Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) for the country. To operationalize the theme, an Inter Agency
Working Group has been established. The group is mainly active in the areas of violence against women and
gender sensitization. The Bank and [FAD co-finance the Rural Women's Development and Empowerment
Project.
Decentralization: Decentralization is the second UNDAF theme, and also has its own inter-agency group. The
Bank, UNDP, SDC and the Planning Commission co-sponsored a national workshop on decentralization in
December 2000.
Child labor: A third UN inter-agency group spearheads the international effort against child labor in India. This
group is chaired by ILO, which takes a leadership role on child labor issues. Other UN agencies active in the
group and on child-labor issues include UNICEF, UNDP, UNIFEM, UNESCO, UNFPA and UNDCP. Current
plans of the group center around an advocacy campaign against the worst forms of child labor. The Bank is
represented on the group by its child labor focal point.

Povertyreduction: We have co-sponsored two conferences on poverty reduction with UNDP. The Dutch
Government has also funded Bank research projects to deepen our understanding of poverty in India, for
example, by combining quantitative and qualitative analysis.
Infrastructure: The Japanese government has supported our work in infrastructure, by co-financing for
example the 1998 Paris conference on private infrastructure opportunities in India, and by co-financing several
large infrastructure projects. Both Japanese and British governments plan to support an innovative project for
market-based financing systems for community infrastructure for poor and low-income communities, in
partnership with domestic commercial financial institutions and multilateral development institutions. The Bank
and ADB have just completed a joint road sector strategy paper, that provides a clear vision for what we are
trying to achieve in India and how we are proposing to work together.
WatershedDevelopment: The Bank is chairing an inter-agency working group on which Gol is also
represented, to harrnonize funding agency guidelines for watershed development.
Rural water supply: The Water and Sanitation Program (WSP), supported by 15 bilateral and multilateral
donors, actively collaborates with the Bank in developing and supporting sectoral reforms as well as in
knowledge sharing. The national sector reforms underway are built upon the pioneering pilot and demonstration
projects supported by the Bank, DANIDA, DFID and the Dutch government as well as the sector work
supported by DANIDA and the Bank.
Irrigation: The Bank and ADB are pooling resources to assist the state of Madhya Pradesh develop its water
resources management strategy, the implementation of which we may later support.
Education: The District Primary Education Program is supported by 5 different funding agencies, all of whom
jointly supervise, with the Government of India, a common program.
Health: To combat HIV/AIDS, we have partnered with UNAIDS, USAID, DFID, AusAID and CIDA. The
anti-leprosy and TB programs are jointly implemented with WHO, DANIDA, and ILEP (a group of international
NGOs).

RenewableEnergy: KfW has taken over from the Bank the preparation of a solar thermal power generation
project in Rajasthan, to be funded by GEF as a complement to the state's power sector reforms.

Procurementand Financial Management: Fiduciary Issues
The Risks to Bank Funds
1.
Significant misuse of Bank funds has not been an identified feature of the investment portfolio in
India. Use of mandatory bidding/contract documents and oversight at all phases by IBRD/IDA have
brought relatively high discipline into procurement on Bank-financed projects. However, analysis of audit
and procurement compliance in the IBRD/IDA portfolio indicates that there are some outstanding issues,
where improvements are required:
*

Delays occur in submission of audit reports for many projects in the IBRD/IDA portfolio, in some
cases leading to discontinuance or suspension of disbursements. The main reason for the delays is the
inability of most project entities to prepare the financial accounts in line with requirements of the
external auditors in a timely fashion, or delays in timely completion of the audits. Disallowances for
ineligible expenditures are regularly reported by auditors, requiring recoveries by the Bank. Project
audits, which are mostly carried out by staff of the Comptroller & Auditor General of India, have
tended to focus mainly on assessing transactional compliance rather than the adequacy of systems of
internal control. Most annual audits have not adequately included assessment of procurement
procedures, nor involved any substantial physical inspection of assets.
* Government accounting systems have not been structured, through their charts of account, to provide
information in classifications and levels of detail meaningful for IBRD/IDAproject management.
* The major concerns for procurement in the IBRD/IDA portfolio relate to: unduly long processing
times; the need to revise the outdated data books in the Irrigation and Public Works Departments which
lead to frequent rejection of bids; the need for preparing a common handbook on standard technical
specifications for equipment procured under Health, Nutrition and Population projects; and the need to
better enforce Bank guidelines for procurement of goods, works and services below prior review
thresholds.
* Funds flow procedures between the Government of India and the states, and between state governments
and implementing agencies, have been consistently delaying the process of putting project funds in the
hands of implementing agencies. The procedures have scattered responsibilities and fragmented
accountability, and have led to cash flow problems and inefficiencies in project financial management.
2.
Relevant diagnostic work so far completed (a Country Profile of Financial Accountability in FY99,
financial management/governanceassessments for the Uttar Pradesh Fiscal Reform and Public Sector
Restructuring Loan/Credit and proposed programmatic structural adjustment loans to Karnataka and
Andhra Pradesh, and the first phase of a Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR)) indicate both
strengths and weaknesses in existing public financial accountability systems at central and state levels.
Principal findings from this work include the following:
*

The role of the legislatures as principal watchdogs over public finances is well accepted and has a firm
legal basis. However, stakeholders within India recognize the need for improved effectiveness in
practice of oversight functions. In some states, Public Accounts Committees (PAC) have been
dormant. Holding hearings in private and delay in discussions by financial committees of budgets and
audit reports, and lack of an effective system of follow up on corrective actions to address significant
audit findings are areas that have been identified as needing greater attention. In UP, there has been
some early progress in this area. The PAC, for example, has been revived after a long period of
inactivity, and is now examining current audit reports.

India: Country Assistance Strategy

Annex 6
Page 2 of 4

* The independence of the Controller & Auditor General (C&AG) from the executive is well established
in a fornal sense and the C&AG's mandate is broad. However the continued responsibility of the
C&AG to undertake accounting functions in the states impairs the states' capacity for and ownership of
financial management and reporting. There is also a need to improve audit capacity including in the
area of value for money auditing. The C&AG and Bank are discussing the provision of assistance to
undertake capacity assessment and strategy development in FYO1-02 that will involve external as well
as internal stakeholders.
* The media plays an active role in India in discussions on public financial accountability. There are
divergent views within India as to their effectiveness and role, particularly with regard to whether
public accounts committee deliberations should be opened to the media.
* Many of the sectors within government suffer from common problems (over-staffing, corruption, poor
budgetary management, lack of accountability,weak monitoring and evaluation). Internal control
procedures focus on procedural compliance over transactions, particularly concerning budget
adherence, but not effective financial and procurement management. The ownership of accountability
for effective resource management and reporting within the bureaucracy is not strong.
* By and large, procurement by central government works satisfactorily if compared to public
procurement in other developing countries. The system is not without weaknesses, however. Delays in
tender processing, lack of transparency in tendering, lack of adequate bidder appeal mechanisms, poor
quality of tender documents, lack of public procurement laws, and insufficient training of procurement
staff and auditors are areas which need attention.
Financial information on such aspects as public debt, guarantees, loans and investments is reported
P
with varying quality along with revenues and expenditures at central and state levels. Detailed
guidelines for budgeting and monitoring of the use of public funds exist but are not always observed
for lack of enforcement and accountability.
Addressing the Risks
3.
The response to addressing fiduciary risk in IBRD/IDA investment projects in the India portfolio
has been, in some cases, to "ring fence" project management. This includes establishing project accounting
systems operating in parallel with government or entity accounting systems. This has occurred primarily to
meet requirements of project implementing agencies to produce, for all new investment operations
appraised since July 1998,project management reports (combining financial, procurement and physical
progress indicators) in the formats currently required under the Loan Administration Change Initiative
(LACI). Mainstream government accounting systems have not been adequate for this purpose.
4.
Annual financial audits of IBRD/IDA projects have been supplemented in certain cases with
internal audit and technical audit requirements. In addition, the Bank has engaged its own staff and
consultants to conduct ex post reviews of: (a) procurement below prior review thresholds and (b)
expenditures which have been reimbursed by the Bank on the basis of Statements of Expenditures rather
than full documentation.
5.
"Ring fenced" approaches to procurement, accounting, and auditing are not applicable to
programmatic adjustment lending, where general budgetary support is envisaged. Fiduciary risk reduction
strategies for these operations require mainstreaming of public financial accountability systems to move to
internationally accepted levels of performance and transparency. At the same time, improvements in
mainstream systems can lessen (and eventually eliminate) the requirements for "ring fencing" on
investment projects. The emerging programmatic approach in India provides the Bank with an incentive
and a basis to engage with the central and focus state governments on strengthening their general public
sector procurement, financial management and accountability systems.

India: Country Assistance Strategy

Annex 6
Page 3 of 4

6.
A fiduciary risk mitigation and capacity building strategy is therefore proposed for FY02-04, which
will substantially increase the level of analytical work and technical assistance by the Bank in this area. In
terms of analytical work, the following is proposed:
*

Completion in FY02 of the CPAR to extend analysis already completed for central government
procurement functions to selected states (Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh) and central/state
public sector undertakings;
* Completion in FY02 of a first Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) covering key
components of public financial accountability in the central government; public financial accountability
systems in selected focus states where programmatic adjustment lending is currently underway or
planned; and local government governance/financial accountability systems in those states where the
Bank will be active at the local government level. State Financial Accountability Assessments will be
completed for those states where programmatic adjustment loans are being prepared. The CFAA work
will be undertaken in partnership with other interested donors (DFID, the Netherlands, Canada,
USAID, and ADB have expressed interest in working closely with the Bank on the CFAA work).
* Annual public expenditure work in the focus states will evaluate: (i) key expenditure priorities in the
government's budget supported by Bank lending; and (ii) progress in strengthening public expenditure
management to better achieve aggregate fiscal discipline, prioritize spending and improve
accountability for the use of fiscal resources.
* Increased use of institutional assessments at the sectoral level to mainstream governance concerns in
the design of sectoral operations and strengthen government effectiveness on a sector-by-sector basis.
Examples include institutional assessments in the highway, education and health sectors, examining
accountability arrangements for better performance and service delivery.
* Possible inclusion in the CFAA of an analysis of India's private sector accounting and auditing
practices and corporate governanceframework, against international benchmarks, This will be done in
partnership with IFC and other interested bilateral/multilateraldonors and will utilize ROSC
methodology.
7.
Technical assistance will be provided through sectoral dialogue, as well as provision of IDF and
Bank-administeredtrust fund grants, to build capacity of key public accountability oversight institutions.
The Bank will support locally-led efforts to strengthen central and state legislative oversight of public
finances, and public sector audit functions of the Comptroller & Auditor General of India at central and
state levels. Technical assistance will also be provided in parallel with programmatic adjustment lending, to
address known weaknesses in budgeting, accounting,reporting and internal control systems.
8.
Programmatic adjustment operations supporting governance reforms. Fiduciary risk is
credibly mitigated when government-wide systems are reformed to enhance transparency and
accountability for the use of fiscal resources. To this end and as discussed in the main text of the CAS,
governance reforms constitute a critical component of our programmnaticadjustment loans to the focus
states. Among other things, the governance reform programs include measures to: (i) strengthenpublic
financial accountability (e.g., establishment of controller's office to lead government's financial
management reforms; reduced lags in government's response to audit reports, placement of monthly
financial accounts on the internet; (ii) enhance transparency and competition in public procurement (e.g.,
legislation for transparency in tenders and procurement, placement of tender bulletins on the internet); and
(iii) foster greater public oversight through published surveys on corruption, citizen charters and freedom of
information legislation.
9.
Portfolio ManagementActivities. We plan an in-depth review, during FYC1-02, of the
implementation of project management reporting requirements, and related computerized accounting
systems. This will include identifying, with Gol and central and state implementing agencies: (a) the extent
to which mainstream government systems can meet project management reporting requirements; (b) the

India: Country Assistance Strategy

Annex 6
Page 4 of 4

scope for applying project investments in financial management systems to building long term capacity
within implementing agencies; and (c) interim solutions such as the use of generic project accounting
software across projects, that will reduce the need for specific project investments while government
systems are being reformed and upgraded. We will also follow up, during FY01-02, the steps agreed with
Gol to address project funds flow problems, and identify further strategies to streamline disbursement
processing, including electronic submission of withdrawal applications.

B. SUPPORTING CRITICAL PRO-POOR INTERVENTIONS
Bl. Promoting Education and Health for All
Bla
Elementary
Education
Subsidies to
primary
education are
as pro-poor as
the best of the
programs
directed
explicitly at
fighting
poverty.

BibHealth
Health and
nutrition
indicators in
India are low,
with
enormous
gaps between
the poor and
the better-off:

Enrollment rates are
rising for elementary
education and the gender
gap is falling. But even
today only 79% of India's
elementary school agegroup (age 6-14) are
enrolled. With literacy at
just above 60%, there is a
long way to go.
* Education resources
and performance
inadequate
* State governments
are main financiers of
education, but state-level
education strategies are
weak

.
Support for universal
elementary education as a
fundamental right
.
Decentralize planning,
supervision and management
through local bodies
.
Mobilize local
communities, and use
advocacy and media
campaigns
*
Build stronger
partnerships with NGOs
*
Provide new
opportunites for the poor and
disadvantaged
*
Provide options to
attract working children

*
Support efforts to improve
education quality and access
*
Reduce out-of-school
children, particularly girls and
children from socially
disadvantaged groups, and
encourage innovations to attract
working children to school
*
Encourage a shift in
composition of public
expenditures towards elementary
education
*
Gol has decided to end
District Primary Education
Program (DPEP) and to launch a
bigger program of Education for
All building on its success

*
Ongoing Portfolio of 6 DPEP projects covering
15 states;
*
New lending/credit support. Second
DPEPproject in Rajasthan, for elementary education.
Modes of subsequent support will depend on reaching
agreement on support for Gol's new Education for
All program and on the Bank role in interacting with
state govemments in education
*
AAA: work on selected state education sectors,
evaluation of the inipact of DPEP, secondary school
issues, continuing analyses of private education
(especially aided schools), early childhood
development and possibly on information technology
in education
*
IFC: Possible investments in private
educational institutions

* Discase burden and
nutritional problems
remain high
* TB is on the rise; the
spread of HlV/AIDs could
become a threat to India's
future
*
Substantial variations
in health care services
across the population

*
Integrate different
health and nutrition services;
better utilize existing
facilities
*
Decentrahzed planning
and program implementation
*
Special attention on
HIV/AIDS

*

Focus on health issues of
priority to the poor, including
child health, reproductive health
and communicable disease
control, especially new tbreats
(HIV/AIDS)
.
Assist in developing
capacity to manage public health
programs effectively (e.g. in
surveillance and food and drug
contiol) at central and state levels
*
Aid in developing more
efficient, effective and sustainable
health systems at the state level
*
Continue to focus on women
and other vulnerable groups
*
Increased focus on: (i)
decentralization; (ii) public/
private partnerships in health; (iii)
enviromnental health issues

*
Ongoing portfolio of state health systems
projects in Orissa, West Bengal, Punjab, Maharashtra,
Andhra Pradesh, Kamataka and UP; central
govemment programs to combat HlV/AIDs, TB,
malaria, leprosy, bhndness and under-nutrition.
*
New lending/credit support to finance state
health systems in Karnataka and Rajasthan; central
government projects on integrated disease
surveillance and health capacity building (food and
drug control); cross-sectoral interventions for
improving health and livelihoods of the poor (e.g.
maximizing health benefits in state water and
sanitation projects)
*
AAA: Completion and dissemination of major
sector work on public/private roles in health, and
household energy, air pollution and health study, to
support policy dialogue with both the center and
selected states

B2. Accelerating Pro-Poor Rural Development
Directly
attack rural
poverty and
enhance
social
protection in
rural areas
through
innovative,
communitybased rural
initiatives.

*
About 75% of the
poor are in rural areas
*
The poor in general
have little or no access to
assets and are dependent
on wage labor.
*
Specific groups are
particularly vulnerable:
there are both gender and
caste based disparities in
access to economic
resources and services
*
India spends heavily
on anti-poverty programs
in rural areas, but the
efficiency and efficacy of
these programs are
questioned.

Strengthen rural
infrastructure and expand
access to basic services (such
as water supply and
sanitation) in a manner which
benefits the poor. Antipoverty projects need to be
restructured to provide an
effective safety net, with
increased local participation,
social mobilization, and
transparency
*
Improved and
sustainable natural resource
management is key, since so
many of the poor are
dependent on forests and
waste lands
*
Target initiatives to
women and other
disadvantaged groups
*

*
Support innovative projects
which can, by their demonstration
effect, help improve the design
and implementation of Gol and
state-sponsored anti-poverty
schemes, and thus improve the
rural safety-net
*
Various sectoral and multisectoral approaches can be
adopted, but with common
principles: (i) often a
programmatic approach will be
most useful; (ii) involve and
empower beneficiaries under a
decentralized approach; (iii) use
NCGOsand altemative service
providers; (iv) support
complementary institutional and
policy reforms; (v) promote cost
recovery; (vi) target to the poorest
areas and most vulnerable groups;
(vii) integrate interventions for
maximum impact
*
Integrate environmental,
social and gender consideratbons
into project design and policy
analysis

*
Ongoing portfolio of DPIP projects in AP,
Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan; Sodic land
reclamation project in UJP;AP, Kerala and UP
forestry projects plus Forestry Research Education
and Extension Project; multi-state watershed
development and Eco-Development projects; Rural
Women's Development and Empowerment Project;
Gender-thematic supervision to be undertaken for
rural development portfolio
.
New lending/credit support includes AP Rural
Poverty, Madhya Pradesh and other state forestry
projects, Kamataka Watershed Project, and possible
future DPIP initiatives
*
AAA: Analysis in selected states on: antipoverty programs, decentratization, and natural
resource-poverty linkages. Periodic survey-based
reviews of the effectiveness and inclusiveness of
project-based user-groups.
*
Collaborative rural poverty reduction strategies

*
*

sustainable activities
*
Increased
parfiipabon of women
and the disadvantaged in
decision making and
attaining benefits
*
Greater land
reclamation, forest
regeneration and
biodiversity protection

B3. Community Driven Urban Development
Initiate work
in
communitydriven
development
in urban
areas.

*
Urban poverty
increasingly important, as
urban areas projected to
grow more quickly
*
More than 20% of
urban dwellers live in
slums, with higher
numbers in largest cities

*
Adapt community-based
approach which has been very
successful in rural areas to
work in urban areas

*
Promote demand-driven and
community led development of
urban services
*
Learn from what has worked
and scale it up (experienec in
other donor-backed projects;
strong urban women community
groups in some states)
*
Explore sustainable
financing mechanisms, including
credit for community
.__ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ infrastructure
