Executive Summary

i.
The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Georgia for FY10-13 has been prepared against the
backdrop o f twin crises - the August armed conflict with Russia followed by the global economic
downturn. As a result, the joint World BanWIFC strategy focuses on post-conflict and vulnerability
issues in the near term, and strengthening the foundations for medium term competitiveness and growth.
ii.
Over the past five years, Georgia has embarked on a program of deep reforms. The Government
has pursued a large reduction in corruption, a major improvement in the private sector environment, and
the introduction o f a targeted social assistance program. It now has the highest policy and institutional
assessment rating (CPIA) in the IDA cohort. In keeping with these reforms, Georgia attracted significant
foreign investments, trade expanded, and growth through August 2008 averaged over 9 percent annually.
iii.
The August 2008 conflict and the following global economic downturn have altered the dynamic.
Georgia has remained on i t s high reform track. But the global economic environment may not provide
the same growth impetus as in the past, as levels of foreign investment and trade may be lower at least in
the near term. Current projections are for GDP to contract by about 4 percent in 2009 before growth
resumes at about 2 percent in 2010.
iv.
The Government of Georgia has responded to the twin crises with an appropriate macroeconomic
policy mix. The currency was devalued by about 16 percent against the US dollar and an auction system
was introduced for foreign currency. Exchange rates have stabilized, as have gross reserves at about $1.5
billion, re-establishingthe level before the conflict. On the fiscal side, authorities have implemented strict
controls over non-priority public spending, while leveraging donors to support countercyclical funding in
key job-creating investments and widening the social safety net. In the financial sector, the short term
rollover risk related to the banking system has been contained, though vulnerabilities remain in the
medium term.
v.
A central element in providing economic and financial stability during the current period has been
donor support. The IMF approved a $750 million standby program in September 2008, which has
recently been augmented by about $400 million and extended through mid-2011. In October 2008, the
international community collectively pledged $4.5 billion over a three year period including budgetary
support, expanding the social safety net and addressing the needs o f IDPs, core infrastructure priorities,
and the private sector, including significant support to commercial banks. To date, donors have
committed about $1.7 billion o f the donor pledge.
It i s in this context - and Georgia’s new status as a blend country - that the CPS envisages Bank
vi.
Group financing o f about $740-900 million over four years, underpinned by a strong program of
knowledge services. The financing envelope includes the remaining IDA-15 envelope (projected at about
$130 million), IBRD lending (of about $266 million), disbursements under ongoing IDNIBRD projects
(of about $135 million) and IFC investments and lending (of about $210-360 million). While lending i s
necessary to meet investment needs, knowledge services are equally important to aid policy choices and
suggest appropriate actions for addressing vulnerability and strengthening competitiveness, and therefore
help meet Georgia’s development objectives.

vii.
New IDA and IBRD lending under the CPS program i s heavily focused on budgetary support
(with an emphasis on further deepening reforms in social assistance, the business environment, and the
expenditure framework) and infrastructure (particularly in the area of roads to strengthen internal
connectivity and Georgia’s role as a transport corridor within the South Caucasus). These activities,
combined with 11 ongoing projects and IFC efforts, are intended to address both pillars o f the CPS. On

the first pillar, these efforts would provide near term support for economic and fiscal stability, the poor
and vulnerable and help create immediate jobs. On the second pillar, they would advance future
competitiveness and export potential.
viii.
Now that Georgia i s a blend country, the pace at which it will begin the process o f graduating
from IDA to IBRD adds to uncertainties. Resources are estimated conservatively, without pre-judgingthe
potential for either continued access to IDA under IDA-16, or a change in the amounts o f IBRD access.
Within this estimated envelope, IDA and IBRD funds are frontloaded to provide countercyclical support
during the current downturn. As a result, at estimated levels, the Bank would not be able to provide
much, if any, new IDA and IBRD funding in the outer years of the CPS. The levels of IDA and IBRD
support will be reviewed at mid-term and may be adjusted to reflect the evolving situation. The program
leaves open the potential for additional amounts, should they be available, to enhance budget and
transportation support, but also maintain Bank lending in sectors in which it has been active but where
operations are concluding (such as municipal development, health, education, agriculture, energy).
ix.
The IFC program would continue to support the financial sector with both resources and advisory
services, but seek to rebalance its focus with a greater emphasis on support to the real sector through
financing and advisory services to the private sector and possible support to the Government through
advisory services related to priority sectors, such as agribusiness and infrastructure. IFC and IDNIBRD
synergy will be deepened in our support to the financial sector, in infrastructure and in further enhancing
the conditions for doing business. IFC’s response, in terms o f both the size and composition o f the
program, will depend on the duration and characteristics o f the crisis.
x.
Knowledge services are central to the Bank Group’s strategy. Bank analytic work and dialogue
on public expenditure choices and poverty analysis will be critical inputs to supporting medium term
fiscal adjustment. Post-conflict monitoring and reporting will be essential to ensuring donor funding i s on
track and well coordinated. Other critical work will be the Bank’s efforts to support IDP welfare and
economic integration, IFCs support for improving the business and financial sector environment, critical
sector work in health and education, supporting greater trade integration and quality standards
(particularly in the context o f the EU’s Eastern Partnership Agreement) and helping the Government
improve monitoring, evaluation and overall communications.
xi.
The strategy described above i s designed to channel funds in the most effective manner during a
difficult period, but i s not without risks. The largest risks are associated with (i) the potential for the
economic downturn to be longer and deeper than anticipated, based upon the global and domestic
economic and political environments, (ii)limited scope for Bank financial support to respond to emerging
needs in the outer years o f the CPS, due to IBRD and IDA frontloading and uncertainties regarding IDA16 eligibility and (iii)rapid growth o f non-concessional borrowing in the wake o f the crisis. A higher
debt service profile, including a challenging peak in debt servicing obligations in 2013, could, in a slow
recovery scenario, crowd out key growth and social expenditures. Broad national support for the key
prongs o f the development strategy and continued Government reforms would help mitigate some o f
these risks. But the risks require building a strong basis for recovery and post-crisis growth, medium term
fiscal adjustment including strengthening public expenditure management, and careful debt management,
taking into account external financing including donor support. These are central elements o f CPS
implementation.

0
Are the programs of the IFC, IDA and IBRD well integrated and mutually supportive?

GEORGIA: COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY

I.

The Country Context

A.

Introduction

1.
This Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY10-13 reflects the Bank Group’s intended
support to Georgia in recovering from the August 2008 armed conflict with Russia and the global
economic crisis, and setting the stage for future competitiveness. With income per head about $2480
in 2008, Georgia now ranks as a lower middle-income country and i s an IDNIBRD blend country. The
CPS envisages full use of the remaining IDA-15 envelope (projected at about $130 million), an indicative
IBRD lending amount of about $266 million over this four fiscal year period, as well as projected IFC
commitments of $210 360 million. Combined with undisbursed amounts of about $135 million as of
end-FY09, total financing during this period from the World Bank Group i s expected to total about $740900 million. Bank and IFC lending will be complemented by a focused program of advisory services.

-

2.
Several principles guide the CPS: First, there i s direct alignment with Georgia’s development
program as provided in both the longer term plan set out prior to the August Conflict as Georgia without
Poverty, as well as in the Joint Needs Assessment (JVA) endorsed by the Government which set out a more
focused program in the aftermath of the August Conflict, and in the Government’s just published Basic
Data and Directions (BDD) exercise it prepares in the context of i t s medium term expenditure planning
exercise. Second, the Bank Group will exercise a strong level of selectivity, recognizing where other
donors can lead or where the country has adequate internal knowledge and capacity. The JNA provides a
strong framework for a division of labor among donors based on an agreed framework. Third, the CPS
will need to be implemented with flexibility, given the uncertainties on the depth and duration of the
international crisis and the uncertainty of Bank lending levels. Heavy frontloading the allocation o f
Georgia’s lending envelope at the request of the Government i s expected to yield higher economic and
social returns than a more even allocation, but increases the uncertainty in the outer years of the CPS. The
capacity of the Bank Group to respond to Georgia’s growing and complex requirements beyond the initial
period will need to be carefully reviewed at mid-term. Finally, coordination within the Bank Group will
enable the Bank to deliver IDA, IBRD, and IFC resources to best meet the strategic objectives of the CPS.
B.

The Political Context

3.
The domestic political scene i s strained. During the first four years following the 2003 Rose
Revolution Georgia enjoyed rapid growth and the Government undertook significant governance,
economic and social reforms, with impressive results. In 2007 domestic tensions grew and led into
demonstrations to which the Government reacted with a brief period of martial law. Early elections were
called and President Saakashvili won a second five year term in January 2008. In 2009, tensions again
rose with some opposition parties seeking fresh elections. Nevertheless, the domestic situation has been
relatively peaceful, tensions appear to have recently eased, and there appears to be support across most of
the political spectrum on continuing liberal economic reforms. Domestic tensions underline the need for
wide dialogue on policy options and investment priorities within and outside o f Government.
Geopolitically, tensions with Russia also remain high. Although armed conflict lasted less than
a week in August 2008, tensions remain. Following intermediation by the European Union, fighting
stopped and both sides separated. The EU has stationed about 300 monitors in Georgia (EUMM) along
administrative borders and, with the OSCE, the UN and the US, i s engaged in a longer term mediation
effort in Geneva, in which all involved parties are participating. Nevertheless, a shared vision for conflict
resolution does not yet exist. The OSCE monitoring mission ceased in Georgia on June 30, 2009. The
UNOMIG mandate was terminated on June 15,2009 and by the end o f 2009 will leave Georgia.

C.

The Economic Environment

5.
Georgia has undertaken deep economic, social and governance reforms over the past five
years. These include impressive progress in reforming the role o f the state vis-a-vis the private sector,
dramatically reducing corruption, and strengthening the business environment (Georgia moved from # 112
in the 2006 Doing Business global ranking, to #15 in 2009). Georgia i s now an open business-friendly
economy with a customs tariff close to zero. While tax rates are relatively low, tax revenues average about
25 percent o f GDP. Other achievements include far-reaching reforms in both quality and efficiency o f
education, health and social protection. Improvements in governance and the business environment led to
rapid growth and increases in FDI. Several international banks entered the country and banking
intermediation grew significantly. Net loans as a percent o f GDP tripled and credit grew by more than 50
percent per year on average. Georgia’s successful debut Eurobond issuance in April 2008 was
oversubscribed and became part o f the EMBI index. Georgia’s performance rating within the World Bank,
the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), rose this year to the highest in the IDA cohort.
Based on this high reform path, the economy grew rapidly with an average growth rate of
6.
over 9 percent per year from 2004 through July 2008. Deep and fast paced implementation o f
structural reforms paid o f f with substantial increases in tax revenue which financed rising public
expenditures aimed at improving basic infrastructure, re-establishing electricity service, reforming
education and health care, and strengthening the social safety net. The development strategy focused on
building a dynamic private sector as the main source o f investment, growth and employment supported by
a small and effective public sector, and elimination o f corruption. Foreign direct investment inflows rose
from an average o f $180 million per year in 2000-2004 to about $1.7 billion in 2007, contributing to the
restructuring o f the economy and stimulating high growth rates (see Table 1).

The August 2008 conflict led to a number of severe shocks to the economy. While the conflict
resulted in tangible direct infrastructure costs, the biggest damage was a result of the heightened perception
of risk and weakening of investor confidence. Bond spreads have since fluctuated between 800 and 1000
basis points. New credit came to a halt, and foreign lending and FDI, which had been engines of
Georgia’s growth, were put in jeopardy. Public finances came under stress due to the combination of
falling revenues and increased unanticipated expenditures related to the need to repair damaged
infrastructure and the sharp increase in demands on the social safety net. Unemployment and poverty were
exacerbated by new internally displaced people (about 137,000 at the height of the conflict, though since
then 106,000 have returned to their places of origin and have received assistance for damaged or destroyed
housing) and others who lost their livelihoods as a result of the conflict. At the request of the Government,
the World Bank and the United Nations took the lead in coordinating preparation of a Joint Needs
Assessment (JNA) during late AugusdSeptember, 2008. The JNA estimated the financing requirements of
the recovery program to be about $3.8 billion, including budget support, social funding including the needs
of IDPs, critical infrastructure and the financial sector.

’

8.
The international community moved quickly to provide support. The IMF Board approved a
$750 million Standby Arrangement (SBA) in September 2008, recently augmented by about $400 million.
In October 2008 the international community pledged $4.5 billion for a three years period (of which
approximately $800 million was for the private sectodbanking system). This i s additional to the IMF
funding. During the first six months of the post-conflict period (the “immediate period” according to the
JNA), the amount o f legally committed donor funds for public and private sector operations was in excess
of $1.7 billion, of which more than $1 billion has been disbursed. This has allowed the Government to
maintain and reorient public expenditures in line with the JNA. Donor resources committed to date have
been focused on immediate needs including budget support ($4 15 million), expanding the social safety net
and addressing the needs of IDPs ($165 million) and rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure and core
priority recovery needs ($442 million). Additionally, the banking and private sector benefited from
significant financing from a number of donors ($686 million), allowing them to meet cross-border
obligations and ensuring banking sector stability. In addition to financial flows, Georgia also benefits as
part of the EU Neighborhood Policy and signed the Eastern Partnership Agreement in May 2009.
However, the global economic crisis has further exacerbated the economic and social impact
9.
of the shocks from the August conflict. Growth projections have been revised downward to -4.0 percent
in 2009, with further downside risks. This contraction appears to be less severe than in some developing
economies, due in part to Georgia’s growing economic resilience as a result of reforms implemented since
2004 and strong donor financial support. Unemployment i s rising from an already high 14 percent in 2008
and may reach 17 percent by the end of 2009. Poverty and inequality are also likely to rise.

10.
The economic crisis has hit the Georgian economy through the following four main
transmission channels-reduction of FDI, shrinkage o f remittances, collapse in export demand, and
a sharp contraction in bank lending. FDI inflows have fallen sharply from $1 -7 billion in 2007 to
a projected level o f about $900 million in 2009. Workers’ remittances which had reached $300 million
dollars by 2008 (or about 3 percent of GDP) have declined by about 20 percent in the first six months of
2009 compared to the same period in 2008. Exports are expected to decline in 2009 by about 8 percent in
real terms and about 20-25 percent in nominal terms. And in the first six months of 2009, banks’ total
assets, loans and deposits, have all fallen while Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) have risen.

1 1.
The Georgian authorities have responded by implementing an appropriate macroeconomic
policy mix directed at mitigating the downturn and maintaining macroeconomic stability in the

’ Georgia’s sovereign bond rating i s “B” according to S&P, and “B+” according to Fitch as o f July 2009
3

medium term. First, the authorities have taken measures to safeguard external sustainability. The
currency was devalued by about 16 percent in November 2008 and, following temporary central bank
intervention to defend the exchange rate, currency auctions were introduced in March 2009 to permit the
market to determine appropriate levels. The auction based system has become the only mechanism o f
foreign exchange intervention by the central bank as o f M a y 25, 2009. Exchange rates have been
relatively stable recently, helped also by the contraction in demand for foreign exchange on account o f
slowing import demand. This has been accompanied by measures to strengthen the foreign exchange
reserves position. While the August conflict led to pressure on the currency and a loss o f international
reserves, at end-June 2009 gross reserves were $1.5 billion, re-establishing the level observed before the
August conflict. The IMF-supported Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) i s a key pillar for this.

12.
Second, countercyclical fiscal measures have been introduced even as the authorities have
implemented strict controls over non-priority public spending. Key to the fiscal response have been
the leveraging o f donor inflows to support job-creating investment projects, and the widening and
improved targeting o f the social safety net. At the same time, non-essential spending has been cut or
deferred. Military expenditures have also been reduced so as to free up resources for priority social and
infrastructure needs. These have been accompanied by measures to improve the efficiency and
effectiveness o f public expenditures. Although the fiscal deficit i s expected to widen to over 9 percent in
2009, covered in large part by increased donor support, the Government i s committed to bringing it down
to about 4.0 percent by 2012.
Third, the authorities have embarked upon a deliberate strategy of securing external public
13.
funds to compensate for smaller private inflows. The authorities have pursued the pledges under the
JNA while also drawing down the IMF supported Stand-By Arrangement. Georgia’s capacity for higher
external borrowing i s enhanced in that it entered the crisis with low levels o f external debt reflecting
prudent debt management and high rates o f growth. Total public debt declined from 56 percent o f GDP in
2003 to 22 percent in 2007, and external public debt to just 17.6 percent. External debt service i s also low,
with public debt service to exports ratio o f about 3.4 percent in 2008. While increased borrowings from
markets, donors and international financial institutions over 2008-09 will increase debt stocks to about 40
percent o f GDP over the next few years, authorities are committed to implementing fiscal adjustment over
the medium t e r m to ensure an adequate fiscal position to meet expenditure obligations.
Fourth, measures have been taken to strengthen the solvency and liquidity of the banking
14.
system. Georgia’s financial system i s dominated by the banking sector with total assets equivalent to 46
percent o f GDP.2 In the first two weeks after the August 2008 conflict there was a temporary withdrawal
o f deposits, but remedial measures, including providing liquidity, were effective in returning some
deposits. Non-Performing Loans over 90 days have risen (currently about 4.6 percent o f loan^).^ With
support from IFC and EBRD, the short-term rollover risk related to external borrowing has been contained,
though vulnerabilities remain in the medium term in the event o f a protracted global economic crisis.
Deposits and net loans are down 20 percent and 11 percent respectively as o f end-June 2009 compared to a
year ago, signaling that confidence remains low compared to pre-crisis levels. While overall loan demand
i s down, banks are also less willing to lend t o other than their best existing customers and loan rejection
rates are high. As a consequence, some liquidity i s available even within a tight lending situation and the
Government i s considering ways to mobilize these funds, possibly through issuing government bills.

15.
A series of measures taken since September 2008 are helping to maintain financial sector
stability. Against the backdrop o f rising NPLs, the Financial Supervision Authority (FSA) has required
banks with riskier portfolios to strengthen loan loss provisioning, which has increased from 5 percent o f

The banking sector includes 20 banks, o f which 7 are foreign controlled. 8 banks account for 90% o f lending.
Using a 30 day overdue measure, NPLs are about 18 percent, which provides an indicator o f emerging stress.
4

total loans in August 2008 to 12.2 percent in June 2009. The financial regulator has also taken a
conservative approach to capital adequacy, requiring additional capital against foreign currency
denominated loans. In May 2009, the FSA prepared stress-tests on the five largest banks which found that
their capital and liquidity had thus far withstood the foreign exchange depreciation and NPL increase,
though risks remain. Draft legislation i s being prepared for the merger of the FSA and the Central Bank,
creating a consolidated regulator and supervisor for the financial system. Banks are conserving liquidity to
enable them to set aside larger loan loss provisions and to better prepare for repayment of external
obligations.

D.

MacroeconomicOutlook and Debt Sustainability

16.
The global economic crisis i s having a significant impact on Georgia’s outlook for recovery
and growth, which was already weakened following the August conflict. The baseline projection for
the economy i s a contraction of 4.0 percent in 2009, followed by marginal growth in 2010 and a pickup of
growth in 201 1-2012 (see Table 1). Given the uncertainty regarding Georgia’s external environment, as
well as the impact of recent domestic tension on investor sentiment, there are downside risks to this growth
outlook. At the same time, the projected contraction i s less severe than in some other CIS economies, due
in part to Georgia’s strong pre-crisis fundamentals, as well as the fact that the Georgian economy has more
diversified trade and investment links. Notwithstanding the uncertainty associated with economic
projections, the major downward revisions for key economic variables--such as GDP growth, FDI and
trade--relative to the pre-crises prospects for Georgia are significant (see Figure 1 below). Inflation i s
expected to remain moderate at 3-5 percent in the medium term, down significantly from 11 percent at
end-2007 due to sharp declines in capital inflows, credit from the banking sector, and global commodity
prices in the second half of 2008.

17.
External adjustment i s projected to continue over the medium-term, supported by a flexible
exchange rate. As a result o f lower capital inflows (and assisted by an exchange rate policy consistent
with external competitiveness), the external current account deficit i s expected to narrow significantly
from 22.7 percent o f GDP in 2008 to 16 percent in 2009 and 15 percent in the medium term. A key
element in this i s the sharp contraction in imports- from 58.3 percent o f GDP in 2008 to 49.8 percent o f
GDP in 2009, resulting from the economic contraction and a shift o f expenditures away from importintensive defense expenditures. The current account gap i s projected to be fully closed by a combination
o f foreign investment, IMF financial flows, and other donor financing.
Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows are projected to fall in 2009 before recovering
18.
gradually in the medium term. Although existing foreign investors have not pulled out o f Georgia and a
survey o f enterprises conducted in December revealed continued interest in FDI for the medium term,
projected F D I inflows have almost halved to about $900 million (about 8 percent o f GDP) in 2009. This i s
expected to include several large-scale, lumpy investment projects in manufacturing, real estate,
transportation, communications, and other sectors. FDI inflows are projected to recover to about 11
percent o f GDP by 2012.

19.
Reflecting the changed economic fundamentals, a strong fiscal adjustment i s projected over
the medium term. The overall fiscal deficit i s projected to widen to over 9 percent o f GDP in 2009 before
narrowing to 4 percent by 2012. Public expenditures are projected to increase to about 39 percent o f GDP
in 2009 before moderating to about 30 percent by 2012 (see Table 1). The fiscal stance also includes a
significant reallocation away from defense toward social and infrastructure expenditures. Tax revenues are
projected to decline from 25 percent o f GDP in 2008 to 24.4 percent in 2009 and remain in the range o f 23
percent in the medium term. Revenues and grants are expected to decline from 30.7 percent o f GDP in
2008 to 29.7 percent in 2009 and 26 percent in the medium term.
The higher countercyclical borrowing has led to a worsening of Georgia’s debt burden and
20.
debt service indicators, but they are expected mostly to remain within relevant prudential
thresholds. Georgia has been receiving significant foreign financing for post conflict rehabilitation and
economic recovery, with much o f the assistance in the form o f grants and concessional loans. Debt ratios
are projected to rise over the next two years, with external public debt projected to increase from 20.9
percent o f GDP in 2008 to 32 percent in 2009 and about 40-41 percent by 2010/11 (below the prudential
threshold o f 50 p e r ~ e n t ) . With
~
several large repayments due in 2012-2013, the projected external public
debt service to export ratio has a one-year peak at 25.6 percent in 2013 (hitting the prudential threshold o f
25 percent), before falling sharply to below 10 percent in the medium-term. Private debt almost doubled
during the last two years, but i s projected to decline in the near term as the private sector made large
repayments in 2009. The Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) within the recent IMF Third Review o f the
SBA confirms that Georgia’s debt burden indicators are expected to remain sustainable in the medium
term, based on base-line growth levels as well as under alternative scenarios associated with greater
economic shocks.’ But fiscal adjustment in the medium t e r m i s critical for safeguarding Georgia’s
external debt sustainability.

21.
The countercyclical fiscal stimulus to support economic activity in the short term i s
supported by an IMF SBA program for which all structural and performance benchmarks have been
met. The third review has concluded and was discussed at the IMF Board in August, 2009. The IMF also
extended the program until mid-201 1 and augmented it with an additional $400 million which can also be
used for budget purposes.

As per the Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF) for low-income countries
The World Bank i s planning to prepare an updated Joint DSA as part o f the next DPO operation.

22.
Nevertheless, Georgia faces a number o f significant but manageable macroeconomic risks
and vulnerabilities. First, given the uncertain global economic outlook, the decline in capital inflows and
exports could be sharper than currently projected, which would increase the depth and duration of the
economic downturn. Second, with the global economic downturn affecting donor countries and given the
increased demand for funds in other countries, actual disbursement o f donor assistance could fall short of
pledges made at the October 2008 donor conference. Both of these scenarios would require greater
external adjustment, and further downscaling of planned expenditures. Third, the financial sector remains
vulnerable as a result o f the economic downturn. Given that similar shares of assets and liabilities are
denominated in foreign currency, the direct risk to balance sheets from exchange rate depreciation i s
limited, although foreign exchange risks in the loan portfolio may increase credit risk.
23.
A number of risk mitigation measures are being pursued under this strategy. Bank staff, in
collaboration with the IMF, have intensified their macroeconomic monitoring and are engaged in
continuous dialogue on policy tradeoffs and options. Economic projections are updated frequently as new
data becomes available. In order to secure adequate donor assistance, the authorities have worked closely
with development partners on monitoring aid flows. A Progress Report on the JNA which reviewed
financing committed and disbursed, major activities funded, and the outlook on evolving priorities was
publicly issued in July 2009. In order to mitigate financial sector vulnerabilities, banks have increased
provisioning, financing was secured to meet large repayment obligations in 2009, and the authorities are
strengthening supervisory efforts and developing a financial stability plan.

E.

Poverty and MDGs

24.
Poverty. In light o f the poor quality of official household surveys, the Bank and the Ministry o f
Health, Labor and Social Protection (MOHLSP) did a separate LSMS survey in the Fall o f 2007 which
benchmarked poverty at about 23.7 percent with moderate income inequality. The results of the LSMS
were presented in a full “Georgia Poverty Assessment” which was published and made publically
available in April 2009. This report identified three crucial points in the fight against poverty:
The importance o f widening social assistance: Pensions and the newly introduced targeted
social assistance (TSA) program, developed under the Bank-supported PRSO series, have played
an important role in poverty reduction. Extending coverage o f the TSA would help reduce poverty
and income inequality, particularly in the rural areas.
0

The importance of increasing employment: Despite the rise in wages, unemployment remains
the major concern. Public sector labor shedding as part of reforms since Georgia’s Rose
Revolution has not yet been fully matched by growth in private employment.

0

The importance of addressing spatial disparities: Poverty in Georgia i s particularly entrenched
in rural areas (see Table 2). In terms o f the distribution o f the poor across urban and rural areas,
rural poverty rates are higher than urban poverty rates, and the incidence o f extreme poverty in
rural areas i s almost twice that in urban areas. The poverty rate i s also quite differentiated by
regions, with three regions - Kakheti, Shida Kartli, and Mtskheta-Mtianeti- having poverty rates
over 40 percent. Beyond poverty levels, it i s important to note that while rural areas account for
only about 9 percent o f GDP, about half the population and work force are situated there.

The double shocks of the August 2008 conflict and the global financial crisis risk are
expected to worsen the poverty situation in the near term. Were it not for the negative welfare impacts
o f the twin crisis, the poverty headcount in Georgia could be expected to decline (see Figure 2). However,
with the twin crises, the poverty headcount i s instead forecast to rise in 2009. In response, the Government
has already increased budget allocations for social protection in 2009, and i s keeping a close watch to see
if more i s needed. The Bank i s cooperating closely in this effort.

Millennium Development Goals (MDGs): As noted above, the economic contraction may set
26.
back efforts, in the near term, to make significant gains in overall poverty reduction. Progress on many o f
the other MDGs i s strong, though continued efforts will be necessary to protect gains during the economic
downturn. Annex 4 provides a full review o f the M D G targets and status but some highlights include:
0

In heath, significant progress has been observed. Infant mortality per 1000 live births has dropped
from 20 in 2001 to 14 in 2007. However, there i s s t i l l some way to go to achieve the M D G target
o f 7 per 1000 live births by 2015. Maternal mortality decreased from 58.7 per 100,000 live births
in 2001 to 15.6 in 2007, and i s now approaching the M D G target o f 12.3.

0

In education, there i s very strong (92 percent) primary enrollment rates and close to full gender
parity in classrooms. Quality o f education remains a work in progress though, supported through
the introduction o f new curricula and a 12' grade. Learning outcomes have been benchmarked
through TIMSS and PIRLS, though the ranking indicates room for improvement (for example the
8' grade ranking shows Georgia as 33 out o f 49 countries in math achievements).

0

On environment, there has been improvement but there i s also room for further progress. While
close to 100 percent o f the urban population has access to improved water, access i s lower for the
rural population.
National parks are being managed professionally, but forestry i s not yet
managed according to best international practices.

F.

Governance and Anti-Corruption

27.
Georgia has made major strides on governance and anti-corruption since the Rose
Revolution. Addressing corruption and governance issues was seen as an overarching theme that was to
be addressed in each o f the three pillars o f the last CPS. Along these lines, governance reforms
implemented over the last CPS period aimed at maintaining macroeconomic stability, strengthening public
finances and improving provision o f basic public services. Enhancement o f the business sector
environment was at the core of the reform agenda as a competitive private sector i s viewed'by the
Government as the main engine o f growth.

8

28.
Significant steps were taken to improve the public financial management system, including
budget reform and introduction o f a medium-term expenditure framework, implementation of the Treasury
Single Account, simplifying Tax and Customs Codes, reorganization and strengthening revenue
administration, and transforming the Chamber o f Control into the Supreme Audit Institution (SAI),
including amendment o f the external audit legislation to address shortcomings in the area o f public
accountability and oversight.
29.
International surveys (BEEPS, Doing Business) corroborate that concern over bribery has
come down considerably. These surveys indicate a substantial decrease in unofficial payments as well as
time spent in dealing with public officials over interpretation o f laws and regulations. Pervasive petty
corruption was addressed in many public institutions. Traffic police were reconstituted and restaffed to
reduce this endemic source o f corruption. Objective testing was introduced to determine university
placement.
Notwithstandingthese achievements, several areas continue to require attention. While the
30.
Government has made the establishment of an environment conducive for private sector investment and
growth as a centerpiece o f its development strategy, there i s a need to further improve business practices
and regulations to promote maximum competition and transparency. While the judiciary i s being reformed
with the courts system reorganized, re-staffed and judges retrained, continued efforts are needed to reduce
the perception that it i s not independent and that it can be heavy-handed in its approach. There i s also the
perception of an ad hoc and heavy-handed approach to tax collection. Many o f the institutions of
government continue to be weak. Most importantly, there i s a need to continue to deepen the dialogue
between the Government and civil society to build transparency in decision making and program
implementation.

11.

Country Development Agenda and Priorities
A.

The Country Development Program

31.
Several recent documents have laid out the authorities’ development program over the
medium-term. I n January 2008, the Government laid out a medium term reform program entitled
“United Georgia without Poverty”. The program established policy directions in a number o f action
areas, including macro-economic growth, lower taxes, creation o f jobs, focusing the budget on social
programs, extending health insurance for the poor, rehabilitating the road network, increasing hydropower
generation, increasing agricultural exports, and strengthening higher education. While this strategy
predates the significant changes to the economic environment following the August conflict and the global
economic crisis, many o f the policy directions remain valid although the pace at which they are expected
to be reached will need to be adjusted.
32.
I n the immediate aftermath o f the August conflict, the Government worked with the donors
to develop a post-conflict response. This response has included fiscal adjustment, safeguarding the
financial sector, addressing the needs of IDPs, swiftly repairing damaged infrastructure, and seeking and
obtaining international support. In September, 2008 a team lead by the World Bank and the United
Nations (with the participation o f ADB, EU, EBRD, EIB and IFC and in collaboration with the
Government) prepared the Joint Needs Assessment (JNA) which identified the following four areas for
donor support: macro and fiscal stabilization, social needs (especially for IDPs), priority infrastructure
investments, and the banking and private sectors. Donor commitments thus far are on-track in meeting
these requirements.

9

33.
Each year, the Government prepares an annual strategy document titled Basic Datu and
Directions (BDD), which outlines the medium term reform program, provides the medium term
macro-economic framework, including the fiscal resource envelope and allocations, and includes detailed
descriptions of the individual sectoral strategies for achieving these objectives. The 20 10-20 13 Basic Data
and Directions paper has been submitted to Parliament. Some o f the overall strategic directions o f the
Government’s economic reform strategy include: resumption of economic growth, support for social
needs, investments in critical infrastructure, rural productivity, education, judicial reform, and government
effectiveness:
Resumption o f Economic growth: This will be pursued through continuing to reduce taxes,
promotion o f free trade with the EU, improvement in customs processes, and strengthening
infrastructure.
0

Surmort for social needs. The social safety net will be strengthened by increasing pensions
and expanding the coverage and improving the targeting o f social assistance. Expanded access
to medical insurance, with state subsidization for the poor, will also be a priority. Living
conditions for new DPs will be improved and a phased program will be implemented to
provide dwellings for earlier IDPs. Water.supply and sewage systems will be restructured and
rehabilitated throughout the country.

0

Sumort for critical infrastructure: The state will finance core infrastructure projects and attract
where possible foreign investments thus promoting businesses and jobs. A key sector will be
transportation where the construction o f E-W Highway and other segments in the South and
West will be a priority. Energy reliability will be enhanced, including by attracting donor and
private investment to support a new power transmission line and increased hydropower
generation.

0

Rural Productivity.: To increase productivity in agriculture, irrigatioddrainage systems will
be rehabilitated. Assistance to farmers on critical inputs will continue. Agribusiness and
processing will be supported which will also help create jobs. Efforts will be strengthened to
increasing productivity in cattle raising and providing safety against epizootical threats and
providing for food safety.
Education: A l l public schools will be brought into line with modern standards and equipped
with computers linked to the internet. Quality o f teaching at universities will be strengthened
according to international standards and teacher training will be enhanced.
Judicial Reform: Judiciary reform will continue to be implemented and independence o f
judiciary will grow. Criminal and administrative judicial systems, data bases, and judge
selection will be revamped along modern standards. Trial by jury will also be introduced in
certain criminal areas.
Government Effectiveness: The public sector will establish measurable parameters used for
evaluation o f performance and this will make public service more transparent. Budgetary and
treasury processes will be improved. On anti-corruption, a system o f asset declaration of
public servants will be strengthened and a code o f ethics introduced.

10

B.

Key Economic and Social Priorities

34.
I n the light of the twin crises, the strategic objectives of the authorities fall into two main
categories: (i)to address the fallout from the current shocks and (ii)to strengthen competitiveness
for post-crisis recovery and growth. Over the rest of 2009 and into 2010, economic performance will
continue to be constrained by the global contraction as well as the tight liquidity conditions. The f i r s t
challenge for the authorities i s to restore economic stability and protect the social well being of the
population. The Government i s anchoring these objectives within a countercyclical stimulus, financed in
large part by donors. The second challenge i s to position the economy for high rates of growth as
economic conditions improve. For a small open economy like Georgia, the Government believes this can
only be achieved through strengthening international competitiveness and by making Georgia the
destination of choice for foreign investors. This requires building further on the achievements of the past
and completing the unfinished policy and institutional reform agenda.
Meeting Post-Conflict and Vulnerability Needs

As discussed above, the economy faces adjustment pressures from the twin crises. The
35.
Government recognizes this as a priority. Addressing these concerns over the next two years i s critically
important in order to protect the economic and social fabric of the country, and to assure growth and
improved well being in the post-crisis period. This requires action on several broad fronts noted below.

36.
First, the authorities are committed to the effective implementation of prudent countercyclical macroeconomic policies. The authorities have already taken important steps with respect to
exchange rate liberalizationwhich will ease the external adjustment and improve export profitability. The
Government has made maintaining an open trading regime a hallmark of i t s policy. Countercyclical fiscal
policies are being implemented with a strong focus on leveraging concessional donor financing and on
offsetting rising unemployment and poverty. Restructuring on the expenditure side i s underway to keep
the fiscal deficit in line with IMF targets.
37.
The Government has accompanied its countercyclical program with shifts in the composition
of spending towards higher priority infrastructure and social investments as well as by improved
efficiency o f investments. Infrastructure investments will yield high returns in the short-term by the
creation of jobs, especially low skilled rural workers. Social expenditures, on health, education, and social
protection, have been increased from 8.2 percent of GDP in 2007 to a budgeted 10.2 percent of GDP in
2009, while defense expenditures have decreased. Maintaining a focus on priority expenditures as the
authorities adjust the budget i s essential to maximizing the impact on social well-being. At the same time,
public investment has increased significantly in recent years, rising from 2.8 percent of GDP in 2003 to 9
percent in 2007, and maintaining the same ratio to GDP in 2009 as part of the stimulus package. Ensuring
efficiency in the use of these funds will remain an important focus for the authorities.
38.
Second, the Government recognizes that bolstering financial stability is a key objective. The
liquidity and solvency of the banking system were strong at the start of the crisis, and the authorities are
intent on maintaining this strength. At the same time, financial intermediation i s s t i l l low. The authorities
are committed to a flexible monetary and exchange rate policy stance to help restore liquidity in the
markets. In addition, the authorities are strengthening banking supervision through the Financial
Supervision Authority (FSA), soon to be merged with the Central Bank, to monitor NPLs and ensure
adequate provisioning to deal with increased risks to the economy.
Third, the authorities are improving the effectiveness of the social safety net. Georgia’s
39.
system o f social transfers reaches 64.4 percent of the population and includes pensions, assistance to IDPs,
targeted social assistance (TSA), and a number of smaller cash transfer programs. Fiscal outlays for

11

social transfers have increased in the aftermath o f the economic downturn, rising from 4.6 percent o f GDP
in 2007 to 5.8 percent in 2008 and an estimated 7.4 percent according to the amended 2009 state budget.
Social transfers are important for poverty reduction: simulations indicate that poverty would be much
higher without the transfers. In order to address current vulnerabilities but also to strengthen institutional
arrangements for countercyclical social response, the authorities stand ready to (i) further improve
effectiveness o f the part o f social transfers that i s already targeted (Le. TSA), (ii) expand coverage and
adequacy consistent with fiscal constraints, (iii)continue to improve targeting o f social transfer programs,
and (iv) further consolidate administration of social benefits to ensure efficiency. Over the medium-term,
implementation of a well-articulated strategy on the social safety net will promote a robust social risk
management system in Georgia.

40.
Fourth, the Government i s expanding coverage o f health insurance, particularly for the poor
and the vulnerable at affordable rates. Though increasing, overall health expenditures accounted for a
small and insufficient 1.5 percent o f GDP in the 2008 state budget. Georgia has the highest share o f outof-pocket payments in ECA -72 percent of total health expenditures in 2006 compared with 27 percent in
the EU-12 and 16 percent in the EU-15 (WHO Health for All). Georgian households also identify the
health sector among the top priorities for government investment (see, e.g. L i f e in Transition report). The
Government embarked upon an ambitious set o f health sector reforms in 2006 with the objective o f
providing efficient, affordable, and quality health care to all. Health care providers are reimbursed on a
contracted fee-for-service basis and money follows the patient. The Government has a long term vision o f
attracting private operators for hospitals and primary health care facilities, and moving to a situation where
those who do not quality for MIP can purchase it through private insurers with a subsidized minimum
benefit package. A key plank o f it i s the Medical Jnsurance Plan for the poor which has already improved
access to health care for the poor, although a significant share o f them are still not covered. The challenge
for Georgia i s to fully implement i t s reform program and show the expected results from it. The current
economic situation makes it important to ensure that this i s done in a fiscally sustainable manner.

41.
Fifth, the Government has made improving the economic and social well-being of the IDPs a
priority. The Government has moved rapidly in the wake of the August conflict with providing shelter
and housing solutions and income support for the IDPs. At the same time, further work i s needed to
provide income generating opportunities, and improve the quality o f their life, particularly for the young.
This will be an ongoing challenge. The Government i s tackling this challenge in close coordination with
the donor community.

42.
Sixth, the Government recognizes the importance of expanding jobs in the near term as part
of its countercyclical efforts. While the Government will seek to create long-term jobs through building
a robust private sector, it recognizes that targeted public investments in key infrastructure can help boost
short term employment and income. But such near term investments are not enough. I t also recognizes
that this will need to go hand-in-hand with upgradingthe skills o f the labor force (see para 49).

43.
Finally, the Government i s working towards increasing rural productivity and incomes.
Although the share of agriculture in total GDP has declined significantly (from 25 percent in 1999 to about
9 percent in 2008), it remains an important sector in Georgia given that over 50 percent o f the population
lives and works there. Issues depressing agricultural productivity and investments relate to fragmentation
o f land, high transport costs and poor roads connectivity to markets, generally degraded rural
infrastructure, and lack of standards for agricultural products. Social outcomes also vary across Georgia’s
regions reflecting the differences in income and poverty rates. While rural out-migration will continue to
be a natural and economic response for the population, Georgia has untapped comparative advantage to
produce a wide variety o f high value agricultural commodities. But productivity and exports have fallen
short o f their potential and with free trade regimes under development with the EU and the US, there i s
significant opportunity to increase production, exports, and create new jobs, especially in rural areas.

12

Environmental management i s another area, important for the rural economy, where Georgia needs to seek
a sustainable balance between stimulating private involvement and the Government’s appropriate
regulatory and monitoring role. Similarly, greater involvement by the Government in integrated planning
and management of watershed areas would be appropriate.
Strengthening Competitivenessfor Sustained Post-Crisis Growth

44.
While addressing the short-term crisis needs are important, the Government of Georgia has
a clear goal of strengthening competitiveness and resume Georgia’s high growth path. To this end,
the Government i s committed to continuing its strong reform approach even during the current crisis
period. However, given the fiscal tightness, significant prioritization and focus i s needed. The
Government i s moving forward in the following areas to strengthen competitiveness:
45.
First, Georgia has made continued improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of public
finances an important priority. Given the scaling up o f public expenditures and the important shifts in
composition o f expenditures that have already taken place, the priority at this point i s to improve the
efficiency and effectiveness with which these higher and better allocated inputs generate the necessary
outputs to support economic recovery and to create the conditions for sustained growth in the medium
term. First, the higher level o f expenditures implies the need to ensure that the expenditures are
contributing effectively to Georgia’s growth and poverty reduction priorities. Second, in the current
economic environment, greater efficiency in public finances will ensure that the countercyclical fiscal
response i s more effective in supporting economic recovery. Third, greater efficiency will allow the level
o f public expenditures to be reduced over time and thereby expedite the process o f re-establishingprivate
investment as the engine for accelerating economic growth in the medium term. Further, the 2008 joint
WB-EU Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment pointed to the need for
further improvements in internal controls, internal and external audit and financial reporting. The
Government has indicated its intention to move forward on public financial management reform including
the gradual introduction of International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). Taken together, the
Government i s committed to a medium-term agenda o f institutional reforms that would strengthen the
results-orientation of the budget and set into place incentives for efficiency, transparency, and
accountability o f public finances. This will be particularly important if the downturn i s deeper than
anticipated and further fiscal adjustments are needed.
46.
Second, Georgia has ‘set out a clear priority to support critical infrastructure improvement
in order to spur foreign and domestic investment. Georgia lags comparator countries in the ECA
region with regard to the quantity o f available infrastructure, based upon an index o f transport, energy, and
telecommunications infrastructure (see Figure 3). A similar lag i s found in looking at the index o f
infrastructure quality. The Government recognizes that in the current environment public investment will
need to play a key role in developing this infrastructure, especially in roads, though private participationin power, airports, telecommunications, ports- i s already being tapped by the authorities. A key
investment need i s o f course in the roads sector which i s essential for boosting the country’s potential as a
transit country as well as to provide better connectivity between rural areas and market opportunities.
Georgia i s also a key location for transit of oil and gas. The development o f infrastructure becomes
particularly important to take advantage o f Georgia’s strategic location with the eventual reduction of
investors’ perception o f political risk.

G e o r g i a has established t h e m o d e r n i z a t i o n of its transportation system a t o p p r i o r i t y .
Georgia’s transport system i s a key link in the historic “Silk Road”, which the Transport Corridor Europe
to Central Asia (TRACECA) initiative seeks to emulate. Both in terms o f geographical location and
existing infrastructure, Georgia i s well placed to absorb growing transport demands. I t i s located on the
shortest route between Europe and Azerbaijan, Armenia and the Central Asian Republics through its Black
Sea ports. Modernization o f the East-West Highway, along with rehabilitation o f feeder roads, i s estimated
to cost over $1 billion. Therefore, the Government has asked separate international development agencies
to rehabilitate different segments, The World Bank i s already financing the most congested section
through i t s first and second East-West Highway Operations. Other donors including JICA, ADB and the
MCC are financing different sections, and the Government i s seeking additional donor support for other
segments. The Georgian railways represents another key link along the East-West transit corridor,
especially for oil and o i l products. In order to increase its capacity and maximize benefits to the economy,
Georgia i s planning to invest around $300 million in the short-run for modernization o f rail infrastructure
from Tbilisi to the ports o f Poti and Batumi.

On p o w e r and gas, t h e G o v e r n m e n t has made significant strides in recent years. System
outages steadily improved in the power sector going
from 15-20 hours per day (outside the capital) to

virtually continuous power supply (see Figure 4).
16
The turnaround in the sector was related in part to
the privatization o f power generation and
distribution. Georgia has also stabilized its basic
energy security by increasing gas supplies from
Azerbaijan through the new South Caucasus
Pipeline (SCP) and other pipelines. Now that
Georgia has obtained a more stable and reliable
energy sector, the next challenge i s to continue to

export oriented production, in the near term the Government i s focused on securing private investments for
construction o f small hydro operations. For the medium to long term, the Government will explore larger
hydropower projects. Further hydropower utilization would also require increased power transmission
capacity for domestic and export purposes, an issue that i s being addressed in parallel. Strong regulatory
involvement i s also needed, within the context o f private provision o f power.

49.
Third, skills development i s key to a globally competitive middle income economy. 38 percent
of firms surveyed in BEEPS 2008 report that the skills gap i s a constraint to operating a business in
Georgia. Thus the Government i s also upgrading skills through ongoing education reform. Reforms
include measures aimed at reducing the gap between skills o f the labor force and the skills needed by a
new globally integrated emerging economy. To this end, reforms include modernizing curricula,
monitoring and reporting o f academic attainment, establishing vocational training, rehabilitating basic
school infrastructure which has been run down through years of disrepair and lack of maintenance,
implementingnational and international testing in order to benchmark progress and introducing transparent
university entrance examinations, and strengthened per capita financing. A new education law has
established School Boards across the country, a 12‘h grade was introduced in 2008, and the Government
has started to benchmark learning outcomes against international ratings (TIMSS and PIRLS). The longer
term challenge for the government i s to maintain the same level o f commitment for further advancing the
broader education reform agenda. Now that basic reforms are underway in basic and secondary education,
the next challenge facing Georgia i s on strengthening professional and vocational education after
secondary school. The Government recognizes the need to consolidate and strengthen higher education,
link higher education to the business and scientific community, and also strengthen vocational education.

50.
Fourth, the Government recognizes that strengthening basic public institutionsand property
rights are important in supporting private enterprise and investment. Further strengthening the rule
o f law including protection o f property rights, increasing reliance on contracts, improving dispute
resolution mechanisms, and further progress in adopting international technical standards are needed to
expand business opportunities in the tradable sectors. A number o f efforts are underway in these areas.
The Government i s implementing judicial reforms aimed at strengthening the rule o f law including
protection o f property rights. In addition, the Government has recently decided to create , a special
commission tasked with developing a program to adopt international and EU standards and technical
regulations in select industrial sectors. This effort has been undertaken in preparation for EU-Georgia free
trade negotiations in the context o f the Eastern Partnership Agreement.
51.
Fifth, the Government continues to see improvement of the business environment as a key
lever o f improving external competitiveness. While the business environment has improved
impressively over the last five years, the costs o f tax compliance and the costs o f transactions across
borders remain impediments to business activity in Georgia. The dimensions o f the business environment
where relative weaknesses are found for Georgia, according to recent Doing Business reports, are “Paying
Taxes” and “Trading across Borders” (see Table 4). Along these two dimensions, Georgia significantly
lags its overall high ranking o f 15, with the “Paying Taxes” rank at 110 and the “Trading across Borders”
rank at 81 .6 BEEPS 2008 reports that one in every four firms finds tax compliance a real constraint to
operating a business and one in every five firms finds customs administration time another area where
improvement i s needed. Significant progress has been made in recent years in introducing risk based
customs procedures, but more i s needed. Reducing the costs associated with paying taxes and importing
and exporting are key levers in improving external competitiveness in Georgia. In addition, there i s an
6

While Georgia also lags its overall ranking along the “Closing a Business” dimension, it has recently adopted a new
insolvency law that shortens timelines for reorganization o f a distressed company or disposition o f a debtor’s assets,
which i s expected to result in improvement along this dimension going forward.

The Government also recognizes the need to strengthen its system of monitoring and
evaluation to better meet the above mentioned development challenges. Central to such a system has
to be the production o f reliable and timely statistics on economic and social conditions. This i s needed for
informed decision-making by policymakers and investors alike. Georgia has long been hampered by poor
quality national statistics. But in a significant move, the authorities have n o w embarked upon a program
o f reforms that aims to establish a new statistical system that promises to produce credible, high-quality,
and reliable statistics in a manner consistent with international best practices. The Government has
recently submitted a new law in Parliament to strengthen statistics including making the Statistics Agency
an independent agency, adoption o f internationally recognized statistical methods and standards, and
improvement in institutional and staff capacity.

A.

The World Bank Group's Strategy
Implementation of the Last CPS

53.
The FY06-09 CPS was prepared in the aftermath of the Rose Revolution. After just 18
months, the new Government had moved quickly on reforms across the development spectrum - in
stabilizing the macro and fiscal situation, improving governance, strengthening infrastructure, introducing
sweeping reforms in education, slashing red tape for businesses, and deepening poverty alleviation.
Building on this rapid reform legacy, the last CPS was focused on assisting Georgia in implementing a
second phase in i t s reforms focusing o n three areas:
0

'

Generating growth and jobs by further removing barriers to private sector development
and improving infrastructure, finance and markets;
Enhancing human development and social protection through improved education, health,
social protection and community services; and

Accounting and Auditing Report on Observance o f Standards and Codes (ROSC), January 2007

16

Strengthening public sector management and budgetary processes to enable Georgia to
better plan and meet its own development goals.

54.
The centerpiece of the CPS was a series of Poverty Reduction Support Operations (PRSOs)
which allowed the Bank to engage on critical reform areas such as energy policy, public sector
management, and social safety nets. The CPS also supported new investments in transport and energy
infrastructure with the aim of improving the private sector environment and strengthening Georgia’s role
as a transit corridor. The Bank also extended i t s engagement in the education sector.
These new
operations were complemented by 18 ongoing operations in a variety o f sectors.

55.
As originally envisaged, the CPS relied solely on ID A financing, as at the time o f its
preparation creditworthiness considerations, including debt levels, precluded IBRD. The original amount
estimated for IDA financing was about $143 million. Subsequently, based on a dramatically improved
performance-based IDA allocation and some frontloading, IDA was able to provide $267 million to
Georgia over the CPS period. By the time o f the CPS Progress Report, it was anticipated that Georgia
would become eligible for IBRD borrowing beginning in FY09 and indeed the Bank extended its first
IBRD to Georgia in FY09 in the amount o f $70 million (thus IDA and IBRD amounted to $337 million).
56.
IFC’s primary strategic focus was on the financial sector, both through advisory services and
investments, to expand access to a wider range o f financial products. During the CPS period, IFC financed
four banks to support access to SME finance, housing finance, and trade finance. In the last year o f the
CPS, IFC focused significant resources on ensuring that the largest commercial banks remained viable
following the twin crises given their exposure rollover risks. In addition to broadening the access o f
businesses and households to financing through its support to financial intermediaries, IFC also sought to
make direct investments in export-oriented companies or those providing services that support overall
private sector development. Within this objective, IFC financed Tbilisi Airport to the benefit o f Georgia’s
travel and tourism business and two transactions to support the development of business and retail
infrastructure. In total, IFC increased its committed portfolio from $54 million at the beginning o f FY06
to $3 12 million currently. As foreseen in the CPS, IFC also implemented a significant advisory program
to improve the business enabling environment, strengthen corporate governance practices, and introduce
new financial products, in particular commencing work on energy efficiency financing.

Results achieved up to the August 2008 conflict

--

With respect to the first pillar - promoting private sector led growth and jobs the Bank
Group program led to good results. Economic growth accelerated driven by a solid macroeconomic
foundation and deep structural reforms consolidating market economy institutions, but also helped by
external factors (remittances, foreign direct investment). The Bank program has contributed to the
achievement o f results primarily through the PRSO series and investments in infrastructure. IFC’s
investments and advisory services were critical elements o f this pillar primarily through investments in the
banking and real sectors.

57.

58.
With respect to the second pillar - human development and social protection - progress has
also been strong. Ongoing investments in Education supported major achievements in curriculum reform
and school financing. Additional achievements include restructuring the schools’ management system,
introducing a new transparent examination system and refurbishing schools in the highest priority areas.
The Bank also helped to fund and establish an International School o f Economics (ISET) based on
international teaching, which i s helping to strengthen higher education and encourage use o f evidencebased economic policy making. IFC introduced a student loan program with Bank Republic towards the
end o f the CPS period. The Health Project was restructured to support the new direction o f moving health
17

provision to the private sector and ensuring the poor had access to affordable health insurance. On Social
Protection, the PRSO helped the Government achieve a major breakthrough - the introduction of a new
targeted social assistance program. On the analytic side, a key result has been the preparation of a full
Poverty Assessment reviewing the components o f poverty and the link to jobs which was published in May
2009.

--

59.
With respect to the third pillar - strengthening public sector management the results
foreseen from Bank assistance have largely been delivered through progress in some specific areas
lagged. Key achievements include improving the budget process and introducing multi-year budget
frameworks, supported under the PRSO series, as well as through the Public Sector Financial Management
Reform Support Project. The PRSO series and the Municipal Development and DecentralizationProject
also supported a new inter-governmental financing system that transfers funds to local governments in a
more transparent and effective manner. Though progress on public procurement has been slower, a good
start has been made in designing an agenda and benchmarking future results through the Country
Procurement Assessment (CPA) and the Public Expenditure Framework Assessment (PEFA). The recent
adoption of a new law on the Chamber of Control elevating i t s status and establishing principles for i t s
operations based on internationalstandards was a major achievement under the PRSO series. Progress was
slower in the area of judicial reform.
Post-Conflict Support in FY09

60.
The Bank modified its approach in the last year o f the CPS, following the August 2008
conflict, to reflect immediate post conflict needs as well as longer term development goals.
Significant analytic work was provided as part of the Joint Needs Assessment (JNA) as well as the
organization with the EU of the Donors Conference in October 2008. Analytic work was accompanied by
additional IDA flows, and some $100 million in IDA was extended in October 2008. This included a
Supplemental to the PRSO-4 ($40 million), a Regional and Municipal InfrastructureDevelopment Project,
including a special IDP housing component ($40 million), and Additional Finance for the Second EastWest Highway Project ($20 million).

61.
I n the aftermath o f the conflict, the Bank worked especially closely with other donors and
the Government on IDP housing. Working with the Government and using rapid response procedures,
housing for new IDPs under the MDF credit were completed by early December, 2008, allowing many of
them to move out of temporary facilities before the winter onset. The Bank also maintained a continuous
policy dialogue on economic management issues, assisted the Ministry of Finance in improving i t s
capacity to track external assistance, and worked closely with other donors to facilitate delivery of their
2008 pledges. In February 2009, the Bank also extended a Peace Building grant of $2.2 million to further
support the development needs of IDPs.
62.
I n March 2009, the Board approved Georgia’s first IBRD loan of $70 million for Secondary
and Local Roads. This had been part o f the Bank’s pledge in Brussels, and will generate much needed
short-term employment throughout the regions, as well as build connectivity and strengthen
competitiveness for the medium-term.

63.
IFC also accelerated its support in the wake of the August conflict, working seamlessly within
the Bank Group on the JNA to assess the overall state of the financial and private sectors, and provided
about $250 million to Georgia. This included significant support (with EBRD, FMO and OPIC) to provide
financing to the two largest banks in Georgia, Bank of Georgia and TBC Bank. This support was critical
and timely, enabling these banks to meet their foreign roll-over obligations in 2009 and preserve financial
stability. IFC also supported the continuation of trade flows through two trade lines to Georgian banks and
continued to invest in the improvement of business and retail infrastructure. Within advisory services, IFC
18

has refocused activities to address emerging needs including conducting a survey o f SME’s on the impact
o f the crisis and providing training to private bankers and regulators on NPL management.

Lessons Learned
64.
Several key lessons are incorporatedin this CPS. These are based on the results of the Country
Assistance Evaluation (CAE) and the FY06-09 CPS Completion Report (CPSCR). In 2008, the
Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) prepared a Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE) to review the
performance o f the Bank in Georgia from 1994 to 2007. Some o f the key lessons gleaned include: (i)the
importance of staying focused and consolidating lending and analytic work on the basis o f client demand,
(ii) strengthening coordination with other partners, including more joint work within the Bank Group, (iii)
ensuring that Bank operations work to strengthen institutions, monitoring and evaluation, and physical
infrastructure, and (iv) continuing to integrate project implementation units into mainstream Government
institutions and ministries.

65.
The CPS Completion Report for the FY06-09 period concurs with these lessons, and indeed
many of them are reflected in this CPS. In addition, the CPS Completion Report highlights the
effectiveness of: (i) maintaining a balance between policy based and investment operations and
maximizing the synergy between them, (ii)building a programmatic approach to both lending and
technical assistance, keeping the focus on just-in-time assistance, and (iii)establishing a good staffing mix,
maintaining experienced staff with in-depth country and sector knowledge, while bringing in new staff that
bring fresh perspectives and ideas.
B.

The New Country Partnership Strategy for FY10-13

The design o f the CPS strongly reflects the difficult economic situation in Georgia. The
66.
strategy rests on the two main strategic pillars o f the authorities’ program - (i)meeting post-conflict and
vulnerability needs and (ii)restoring growth and competitiveness. The first pillar will address key
identified vulnerabilities including macro-stability and fiscal management, jobs, social services and the
financial sector. The second pillar will continue to support Georgia’s structural reform program to best
position itself in the medium term by continuing to improve the private sector environment and build its
role as a transit corridor. I t will do so within the context of strong selectivity (as underlined by the CPSCR
and CAE).

67.
Within these results areas, the Bank will support good governance through four ways: (i)in
the execution o f its fiduciary functions (auditing, procurement, monitoring) within the implementation of
investment operations, (ii)by building capacity within public and private institutions to provide improved
services, (iii)integrating improvements in the monitoring and evaluation system through appropriate
project design and implementation, and (iv) placing an emphasis on improving communications.

68.
Improved public resource management: In the wake o f the twin crises, preserving economic
stability and improving the efficiency o f public expenditures gains prominence. The Bank will work with
the Government to support this, and monitor overall progress through broad economic indicators (e.g.
growth, inflation, debt sustainability etc). Within this broad dialogue, the Bank will focus strong attention
on helping the Government manage countercyclical spending with improved prioritization o f public
expenditures to support growth-oriented expenditures and key social programs targeted at the poor. Part o f
the approach will be to improve the effectiveness o f revenue administration, so that Georgia can maintain
adequate fiscal space once the immediate donor financed stimulus declines. This includes specific support
for strengthening the use o f the e-filing payment system, and risk-based tax and customs auditing. An
equally important element in building a sustainable fiscal framework i s to strengthen systems to help the
government to better prioritize expenditures. The D P O series will play a central role in helping Georgia
in these efforts - e.g. to build performance based budgeting processes and support adequate funding for
social safety nets, public services, and priority infrastructure. This will be accompanied by the Public
Sector Financial Management Reform Support Project, as well as annual analytic support through the
Public Expenditure Reviews. These efforts will be supplemented by follow-up on the agenda on
improving fiduciary controls, laid out in the 2008 Public Expenditure Financial Accountability Assessment
(PEFA) and the Country Procurement Assessment (CPA). The Bank’s Treasury Department will also
provide support on debt management.
69.
Improved performance o f key financial institutions: As an immediate response to maintaining
financial sector stability in FY09, IFC-with EBRD and others--provided significant financing to the two
largest banks. Nevertheless, the banking sector continues to be a source o f risk. Georgia aims during this
period to strengthen i t s banking and monitoring system, re-energize bank lending, and keep the level o f
non-performing loans down. IFC i s playing a particularly important role in this through i t s financial
assistance to systemically important banks and i s also providing these banks with advisory services on
managing NPL, risk management and corporate governance and will continue to do so during the CPS
period. IFC will remain flexible and i t s mix o f products and the volume o f investments will depend on the
duration and impact o f the crisis. The Bank Group will measure i t s success primarily by the financial
health o f IFC-supported banks. The Bank and IFC (together with the IMF) will continue to provide
advisory services to the financial sector during the CPS period. The Bank has an ongoing FIRST grant to
assist the Financial Supervision Authority (FSA) in strengthening it risk assessment o f banks. In addition,
a banking sector diagnostic or an update of the FSAP will be on the agenda during the CPS. Some areas
o f the dialogue include ways to further strengthen the banking sector stability framework, build capacity to
monitor prudential soundness indicators, develop domestic capital markets, and improve the capacity o f
the FSA. The Bank i s also providing technical assistance to improve payment systems to strengthen interbank transfers and the security deposit system.

70.
Increased Employment: A key element o f the Government’s near term strategy i s to create jobs,
particularly to partly offset those jobs lost due to the economic downturn. The Bank will help the
Government monitor the overall levels o f job growth and employment in the country and develop sound
employment enhancing policies. At a more specific level, the Bank Group will help create jobs directly or
indirectly through the projects it finances. During FY09, the Bank extended two new projects which would
both build productivity and growth over the medium term while generating immediate employment - (i)a
loan for Secondary and Local Roads, and (ii) the Regional and Municipal Development Project. The two
new transport investments under consideration for FY 10 - East- West Highway and Kakheti Regional Road
Improvement Project - will also yield significant short term employment generation while also laying
down the basis for increased permanent job and income growth. The Programmatic Poverty Assessment
will continue to review labor markets and the impact o f the crisis on the population. IFC’s support to the
banking sector helps sustain access to finance for SME’s, allowing them to better weather the crises and
keep jobs, and IFC’s direct investment and advisory services in the real sector will similarly help

20

maintaidcreate jobs in those companies. IFC will also seek to support the growth of microfinance to
support creation of self-employment and the sustainability and growth of existing microenterprises.

71.
Improved quality of education: The Government recognizes that simply creating low level
constructionjobs i s not enough, and that sustainable job growth will require a reduction in the gap between
skills needed in a competitive economy and those currently available in the labor market. Georgian
students participated in international testing in 2007, but the results were not strong which suggests further
efforts are needed.' During the new CPS period, the Bank will contribute to improved learning outcomes
and will help the country measure improved scores by students in international and national assessments of
student learning (TIMMS, PIRLS reporting i s being supported under the project). The Bank will measure
its own success through ensuring 100 percent roll-out of the new curriculum in subsequent primary and
secondary grades, completion of urgent school infrastructure works, and introduction of teacher
certification. The Bank will achieve these gains in primary and secondary education through the
Education APL II Project which i s expected to be completed by 201 1. While higher education i s not
included in the project, the Bank has secured Japanese and Danish Trust Funds to continue the dialogue
on strengthening higher education and to monitor progress against Bologna standards. During the CPS
period, the Bank will also prepare an Education Sector Review which will assess progress to date in both
basic and higher education and help Georgia ensure that i t s education system i s at world class standards.

information systems.
Outcome 3: Improved municipal services in supported areas (water, local roads etc)
Outcome 4: Improved IDPs housing and welfare

72.
Safety Nets: Georgia has made major strides in introducing, with Bank support, an effective
targeted social assistance (TSA) program in 2006. The Government recognizes that particularly in the
wake of the twin crises, it will be essential to widen this program further. The Bank will continue to
support the further strengthening the TSA through the DPO series, and will assist in measuring the impact
of the TSA through the annual Poverty Assessment. While the Bank will contribute to the Government's
overall effort to strengthen social safety nets, it will measure i t s success against the specific target
contained in the DPO, e.g. the percent o f the extreme poor that receive poverty benefits through the TSA
(2009 baseline = 30 percent; target = at least 50 percent).
73.
Health Services: The Government i s in the midst of a major health reform, with greater private
provision of services, combined with the introduction of a Medical Insurance Program (MIP), subsidized
for the poorest. The ultimate goal i s to improve key health indicators of the population, where important
strides have been made but further progress i s needed. The Bank will continue to assist the Government in
measuring progress in overall health indicators, and will play a key role in supporting the Government in
implementing i t s new health financing approach in an effective manner. This includes: (i)the
establishment of an effective health information data base that will assist the Government in improving the
implementation of health insurance, and (ii)the specific DPO target o f a substantial increase in the share
of the bottom two quintiles of population with access to subsidized health insurance (current baseline = 20
percent in 2007). The Bank and the Government have recently restructured the ongoing Primary Health
For example, Georgian 8" graders ranked #33 out o f 49 countries in math and 37 in science achievement

21

Care Project to support this approach through the CPS period. In addition to supporting health care
training and equipment, the restructured project w i l l assist the Ministry o f Health, Labor and Social Affairs
in improving i t s database and linking it to the Civil Registry so that subsidized insurance can be well
monitored and targeted to the poor. The DPO series will backstop the effort to extend the MIP to more o f
the poor with the effective implementation and funding for the MIP. The annual Poverty Assessment will
continue to monitor health outcomes and issues. The IFC i s exploring potential investments in private
health providers. At the same time, improved health financing systems must be accompanied with
strengthened institutional capacity to be effective, and the Bank will continue to provide analytic and
technical support on health (and could consider a follow-up project if additional funds become available).
Health and safety efforts will also be furthered through the Bank’s transport projects.

74.
Municipal Services: Georgia recognizes the importance o f building local infrastructure not only
as part o f increasing the well being o f the population but also as a key element in promoting growth. To
this end it i s supporting the improvement o f municipal infrastructure, including water supply, waste water
management, local roads and housing through effective evaluation, prioritization, and financing o f projects
through the Municipal Development Fund. Georgia has also implemented a reform o f inter-governmental
finance in order to ensure that local authorities have needed resources. The Bank has provided significant
support through the M D F towards this effort in the past, and continues to measure i t s success in this areas
against improve water access and quality in supported areas, as well as reduced transport time and cost on
local roads. In 2006 the Bank entered into a service agreement with MCC to help supervise i t s funding
through the MDF. In FY09 the Bank also extended a new Regional and Municipal Infrastructure Project
which i s providing both regular and emergency support in light o f the August conflict. The Bank i s also
administering a Cities Alliances Grant for Tbilisi to develop a City Development Strategy. Project funds
are being used quickly and the Government may request additional financing in the CPS period.
75.
IDPs: Supporting IDPs i s a central and priority feature o f both the Joint Needs Assessment (JNA)
and the recent Basic Data and Directions (BDD). This i s critical not just to improving the lives o f IDPs,
but strengthening country cohesion. The Bank i s working closely with the UN to assess and monitor the
needs o f IDPs and has made available $10 million out o f the recent Regional and Municipal Inpastructure
Project for direct assistance on IDP housing. The Bank has also approved an I D P Community
Development Grant to support the social and economic integration o f recently displaced IDPs into the
society. The EU i s also making available grant resources to the Bank to support this effort. The Bank w i l l
continue to monitor the situation with IDPs through analytic work on the impact of the economic crisis on
IDPs and its follow up JNA Progress Reports, and will measure i t s own success through the specific level
o f IDP housing supported under i t s project and more general integration supported by grant funds.
Stratepic Obiective 2: Strenpthening ComDetitiveness for Post-Crisis Growth

Outcome 1: Transport time and costs reduced along key transit routes
Outcome 2: Improved road safety
Improved Transport Corridor: The Government sees an enhanced transport corridor as a
76.
priority in attracting investment and building on Georgia’s strategic location between Europe and Asia.
The Bank i s playing a critical role in helping the Government achieve this priority both through i t s own
highway investments and in helping to coordinate other donors. The critical measure o f the Government’s
success will be enhanced transport time across the country to the market. The Bank will measure i t s own

22

success primarily against time and costs o f the particular segments it i s supporting directly. These projects
will continue to assist in strengthening the transport corridor and local connectivity while also having a
major impact on both immediate employment during 2009-2011 and on the regional economy (in
particular agriculture). Indeed, improving roads in the Kakheti region i s particularly important as it i s both
one o f poorest regions in Georgia (46 percent poverty rate) and has considerable agriculture potential. At
the same time, the projects will help to strengthen road safety. Several key donors have come together to
adopt the same road safety standards on their interventions, and this too will be a monitorable indicator.
The Bank’s ongoing transport program has been significant and includes Highway Improvement I and IZ,
the Secondary and Local Roads project and technical assistance through the Infrastructure Pre-Investment
Infrastructure Facility. During the CPS period, the Bank will extend new loans to support further
improvements via the Third East- West Highway Project, as well as local connectivity through the Kakheti
Regional Roads Improvement Project. Bank interventions will also support greater coordination of a
broader multi-donor program of rehabilitating the roads network in Georgia. The World Bank will also
continue to provide capacity building for road sector institutions. IFC will seek to catalyze private
investment in transportation and logistics through investments but also potentially through IFC’s
infrastructure advisory services, as requested recently by the Government. On railways, the Bank Group
and the Government may explore the potential for possible support through the IFC-World Bank
Subnational Finance Program.

77.
Overall Business Environment: A central element o f the Government’s growth strategy for the
past five years has been to make Georgia investor and investment friendly, and it has made great progress
in this respect. The Government’s overall goal in further strengthening the business environment i s to
restore foreign and domestic investor confidence, which has been the foundation stone for i t s strong
economic growth. The Bank will contribute to meeting this goal in specific ways. Clearly, improved
transportation infrastructure through its various transport projects will facilitate business activity (see
results area 3). The Bank’s efforts to further streamlining tax and customs through the DPO series will also
be an important input. Improving financial sector intermediation (see results area 1) i s another essential
element. The potential for SME and rural development are also priorities that the Bank Group will support
(see below). Taken as a whole, these targeted results are really more than the sum of their parts. The Bank
will play a role in the all o f these aspects and will measure its own success against various indicators of
business and investor confidence which show further progress needed in specific areas (Overall ratings for
Doing Business, BEEPS are strong, but particular sub-ratings show patches o f weakness). IFC will
continue to provide direct investment support to businesses and will finish i t s project which has provided
advice on improvements in licenses, permits and inspections. IFC i s exploring the potential of future
advisory work on the area o f food safety and will work with regulators to support the implementation of
these processes. Complementing this, the Bank will administer a trade and competitiveness grant to help
Georgia upgrade national quality standards to encourage food and related exports so that it can take full
advantage o f its low tariff trade regime with the US, EU and other countries. A ROSC update to be
conducted towards the end of the CPS period will evaluate the developments in private sector accounting
and auditing practices.
78.
SMEs. SMEs have an important role in Georgia’s transition. They are only 8 percent o f output,
but represent about 20 percent of enterprise employment. Just as important, SMEs have the potential to be
23

engines of innovation and growth. However, they have been hit by the economic downturn and access to
finance to them has become more limited. IFC’s support to the banking sector helps sustain access to
finance for SME’s, allowing them to better weather the crises and keep jobs, and IFC’s direct investment
in the real sector will similarly help maintain jobs in those larger companies. IFC i s also developing
advisory services for SMEs on crisis management in a regional initiative that i s likely to include Georgia
and would help SMEs to cope with key crisis issues, such as currency devaluation, cash flow problems, the
need to reduce operating costs, and the increased costs of financing. IFC will also seek to support the
growth of microfinance to support creation of self-employment and the sustainability and growth of
existing microenterprises. Through i t s investments in the financial sector, IFC i s supporting microfinance,
local currency finance, housing finance, energy efficiency finance, trade finance and reaching a range of
key sectors including renewable energy, agribusiness and tourism. IFC will measure its own success by
the amount of its own direct and financial sector lending support provided to SMEs (IFC will target an
SME portfolio o f at least $750 million by 2013 through i t s financial sector clients. This would be a level
similar to 2007, representing a full recovery after an expected decline in 2008- 10).

79.
Rural Economy: The rural economy i s critical to Georgia’s future growth as well as employment
generation and poverty reduction. The Government’s approach to the rural sector i s to strengthen rural
infrastructure, while also facilitating agriculture financing and exports. To help the Government meet the
first of these goals, the Bank’s primary focus will be on improving the transport time, particularly in the
agriculturally important Kakheti region. It will do so through its transport projects which will reduce
transactions costs for farmers in getting products to and from local and export markets. The Bank has also
provided support in the past for irrigation infrastructure, and while no decision on a new irrigation
infrastructure project has been taken yet in the CPS, dialogue on improving efficient management in this
area will continue. On the Government’s second goal of promoting agriculture financing and exports, the
Bank will actively work with farmers to strengthen supply chains in particular commodities, increase rural
credit, and strengthen agricultural institutions including those involved in safety and certification. I t will
do so through the ongoing Rural Development Project. The DPO series i s also supporting greater use of
food safety controls and phyto-sanitary legislation. The Bank will also provide technical support to the
Government in introducing greater food certiJication needed to increase trade, while maintaining an
investor friendly environment and bearing in mind affordability constraints. ZFC continues to explore
investments in agri-business, including through financial intermediaries, and may also support the
introduction of international principles in food safety. On the analyticalpont, IFC has just completed a
study on the competitiveness of particular agriculture products. The Bank’s Country Economic
Memorandum (CEM) due in 2009 will include a paper on rural development in Georgia. The Bank will
also do follow-up analytic work on the rural investment climate and agricultural supply chains. As
Georgia has experienced both swine and bird flu, the Bank will work with the Government to prepare for,
control and respond to avian influenza, swine flu, and other infectious animalhuman diseases. It will do
so through the ongoing Avian Influenza project
80.
Energy: With the Bank’s help, Georgia has made enormous progress in privatizing the energy
sector, providing a stable supply o f energy to i t s population and businesses, and beginning to be a net
exporter of energy to neighbors. The next step i s to facilitate investment in building increased energy
supplies and transmission lines to neighboring markets. Towards this end, the Bank i s completing a
feasibility study on the costs and benefits of the potential Khudoni powerplant through the ongoing
Znfiastructure Pre-Znvestment Project. The Bank has also been helping to improve the domestic
transmission system through the ongoing Electricity Market Support Operation. Looking towards the
future, The Bank and IFC may explore ways of working together to attract private investors in the
hydropower area, both directly and through financial intermediaries, and will also be coordinating with
EBRD and EIB in this regard. In this regard, the Government has expressed interest in exploring the
possible use of the Bank’s Partial Risk Guarantee product to maximize attractiveness for private
investment in energy or other infrastructure projects. KfW, EBRD and EIB are in parallel considering

24

supporting a high-voltage power transmission line to Turkey. The Bank may also extend analytic support
to strengthen the regulatory role in protecting energy consumers and service quality and to address
regional market issues. Although there i s considerable potential for Bank Group activity, the Bank has not
yet set results indicators in this sector as options still need to be explored.

81.
Environment: The Bank’s operations in the environmental sector have wound down, in part due
to the desire to focus its resources more on other areas, and in recognition o f the efforts o f other partners.
The Bank continues to be involved in administering a multi-country grant - FLEG - which supports
improvement in environmental legislation. In addition, IFC i s also considering support for more efficient
use o f energy and i s carrying out a survey o f energy efficiency practices in five countries in the region,
including Georgia, with the potential for a project that would work with financial institutions and SMEs to
further support this. The Bank will use i t s energy and infrastructure activities to ensure that environmental
assessments and considerations are taken into consideration. The Bank will also strengthen water supply
through i t s ongoing Regional and Municipal Development Project. The EU i s now one o f the most
significant partners for Georgia in the environmental field, especially engaged in assisting with solid waste
management. The UNDP continues to administer modest resources from the Global Environment Facility
granted to Georgia. The most active bilateral donors include Germany and the Netherlands. World
Wildlife Fund (WWF) and International Union for Nature Conservation (IUCN) are international NGOs
that continue to be active in Georgia, providing advice and assistance in biodiversity conservation,
protected areas development, and forest management.

IV.

Implementing the Strategy

A.

Bank Group Instruments

82.
The CPS envisages a focused use of Bank instruments. Bank efforts would center around the
Development Policy Operations, a set o f 11 ongoing investment projects which would largely complete
disbursement during the CPS period, and new infrastructure (primarily transport) projects. Knowledge
services would be central to enabling the CPS to aid the Government in making policy choices and
undertaking appropriate actions to meet the objectives o f addressing vulnerability and strengthening
competitiveness. IFC would provide critical support for both the financial and real sectors, using debt,
equity and other risk management products to flexibly support both i t s counter-cyclical and longer term
role. Bank and IFC trust funds would further help to strengthen analytic support. Close coordination
between the Bank and IFC will support effective implementation. MIGA also remains open for further
projects in Georgia and in coordination with IFC i s in active discussions with the Ministry of Finance on
greater engagement to support more FDI.
83.
A series o f three annual DPOs, within a programmatic framework, will provide both immediate
budget support to the Government while supporting reforms in selected areas - improving public finances,
strengthening social safety nets, and building external competitiveness. The cross-sectoral content of the
DPOs and their leveraging (directly or indirectly) o f budget support operations from other partners, such as
the Netherlands, ADB or the EC will give them high prominence. The CPS Completion Report highlights
the benefits o f the programmatic approach, not just for budget support operations but also on the analytic
side, to deliver just-in-time advice, and this practice will continue throughout the program.
84.
Strong synergy between programmatic support under the DPOs, investment lending, and
analytic support (from both the Bank and IFC) will continue to be a hallmark of Bank operations.
The importance o f this synergy i s highlighted under the CPS Completion Report. I t will be important to
harness the power o f all o f the Bank instruments to support reforms, institutional change and making
efficient use of Bank resources - as was done under the previous CPS. In light of the tight focus of Bank
25

investment operations, it w i l l also be important to bring other donor-supported operations into this
complementarity. For example, on public expenditures, the DPO-supported actions will be complemented
by the Public Sector Financial Management Reform Support Project which itself coordinates technical
assistance across different donors, as well as a*programmatic annual public expenditure review. In the
field o f health, the DPO-supported policy action to widen the medical insurance coverage to the poor i s
complemented by technical assistance through the restructured health project to build an information
system to enable this to occur as well as analytic support. In the field o f agriculture exports, the DPO
supports the Government in strengthening food standards to help build export markets. The Rural
Development Project will reinforce this through practical support in rehabilitating food safety laboratories
and veterinary offices, as well as training for food safety staff. Bank staff w i l l also work closely with IFC,
which i s engaged in identifying product competitiveness as well as development o f a food safety program,
and Sweden, which i s providing analytic work on food safety and testing. In the field o f business
environment, the DPO will leverage knowledge and advice from IFC.
The 11 ongoing operations will enable the Bank to stay engaged in critical areas. These
85.
include health, education, agriculture, transportation, public financial management, and energy. The total
amount remaining in these projects i s about $135 million. This i s expected to be largely disbursed over
the first two years o f the CPS (by end-FY 11). The CPS provides for the Bank to continue to provide
analytic support in these areas as needed after these projects close, and also the flexibility to consider
follow-on investment lending should additional funding become available.

New investment operations by the Bank would be mainly focused on transportation. The
Government has a made a clear priority for the Bank in this sector for reasons discussed earlier. As the
lead donor in transport, the Bank will continue to convene regular donor meetings to ensure that all o f the
different parts o f the transport corridor mesh together seamlessly. Beyond roads, the Bank will stay
engaged on a variety o f other sectors through ongoing and potential new projects, and could provide some
additional support to these, in line with any change in the financial envelope o f the CPS. Interventions will
also be closely coordinated with IFC and other partners to ensure that assistance i s provided in a coherent
and effective manner. The Bank and the LFC w i l l stay engaged with other key donors such as the EBRD to
ensure financial sector sustainability. Infrastructure i s a key area where the Bank and the IFC have roles to
play in cooperation with EBRD, USAID, MCC, JICA and other I F I s and donors. This tight focus i s an
outcome o f strong donor coordination to avoid overlaps, as provided for in the Joint Needs Assessment.

26

87.
Most World Bank Group operations will serve both strategic pillars. While the Bank’s
strategy i s a two pillar approach o f addressing immediate vulnerability while better assuring long term
competitiveness, most of the specific Bank interventions serve both functions (see Figure 5). The
Transport projects will provide both immediate jobs and will improve overall competitiveness and
productivity. The DPO series will help the Government widen safety nets and access to health insurance
for the poor, but will also work with the Government on improving trade and business competitiveness.
The Municipal Development Project will provide both housing and support for IDPs, while also addressing
the need for longer term municipal infrastructure. IFC’s investments and advisory services will help
clients both survive the crisis and become more competitive in the long run. Figure 5 below illustrates this
overlapping situation. The balance between the two pillars has been developed in close collaboration with
the authorities and reflects their strategic directions.
88.
The proposed new lending will be heavily frontloaded. Given the short-term financing needs,
the Government has requested maximum frontloading o f financial flows from both IDA and IBRD
sources. Frontloading i s possible in Georgia with a high confidence of good results because o f the strong
implementation performance o f the Government-both on policy and institutional reforms, and on roads
projects. The frontloading i s driven by the recognition o f the need and Government commitment to put a
stronger emphasis on countercyclical support and safeguarding social and economic outcomes in 2009 and
2010. IFC has also delivered a very large program ($224 million) in FY09 in response to the crisis, and
while it will deliver a significant amount in the CPS period, on an annual basis this may be less than the
FY09 level.
89.
I n terms o f amounts of lending, the World Bank Group financing is currently estimated at
about $740-900 million during the FY10-13 period. The absolute amount o f new IDA and IBRD
lending i s currently estimated to be at least $396 million, comprising $130 milliong utilizing the last two
years of IDA- 15 (IDA- 16 eligibility i s not yet determined) and $266 million in indicative IBRD funding
(see Tables 5-6). IFC financing i s expected to be about $210-360 million over the period, depending in
part on how the crisis unfolds. In addition, there are currently 11 ongoing IDA and IBRD operations with
an undisbursed balance of about $135 million.

The IDA-15 resource envelope i s indicative and actual allocations are calculated annually based on IDA’S
performance based formula, total IDA available, and exchange rates. IFC lending levels also depend on the
identification and negotiation o f appropriate private sector projects.

Given the lending envelope and frontloading, the program laid out has only been fully
elaborated for FY10, and will need to be further elaborated at mid-term. Georgia has started the
process o f graduating from IDA to IBRD, but has done so during an uncertain economic period. As such,
the resource envelope has been estimated conservatively, without pre-judging the potential for either
continued access to IDA under IDA-16, or a change in the amounts o f IBRD access. A t current estimated
levels, the Bank would not be able to provide much, if any, new IDA and IBRD funding in the outer years
o f the CPS. The levels o f IDA and IBRD support will be reviewed at mid-term and may be adjusted to
reflect the evolving economic situation and ensure program continuity. The actual amount o f the envelope
will depend on the IDA-15 performance based allocation framework, possible IDA-16 eligibility, IBRD
headroom availability and IFC’s identification and negotiation o f appropriate private sector projects.
The current unallocated amount of $56 million, and any additional funding that may become
91.
available at mid-term, would be allocated in the light o f evolving priorities. The Bank will maintain
flexibility in programming FY 11- 13. Priority areas for possible future support include further financing
for the two areas - budget support and roads - which are the emphasis o f the CPS, as well as continuing
funding in certain areas where ongoing projects are winding down and new lending support would enable
the Bank to continue to provide an active level o f engagement -- e.g. municipal development, the social
sectors (health, education), agriculture, or energy.

92.
Knowledge services are central to the Bank Group’s strategy. While lending i s necessary to
meet investment needs, knowledge services are equally important to aid policy choices and suggest
appropriate actions for addressing vulnerability and strengthening competitiveness. Knowledge services
would be augmented by the use o f about 20 Bank and IFC trust funds. These trust funds are well
integrated into Bank activities, either directly attached to Bank projects (for example, on rural
development, education and avian influenza) related to achieving CPS objectives (for example: peacebuilding grant for IDP integration, Cities Alliance grant to support municipal planning in Tbilisi, a FIRST
grant to help strengthen the financial sector, and a grant to support produce testing and standards). The
Bank will also seek to use its knowledge services to look at practices across countries, for example in
addressing the impact o f the global economic crisis or in the area o f trade facilitation.
28

93.
Knowledge support will provide critical support on addressing post-conflict and
vulnerability issues. Post-conflict monitoring and reporting will be essential to ensuring donor funding i s
on track and well coordinated. In July 2009, the Bank and the UN issued the first progress report on the
JNA and made this available to the public. A critical area of vulnerability will be to ensure adequate
support to the poorest during the current downturn. The Bank will build on the recently prepared Poverty
Assessment (completed in April 2009) with annual program support in this area to help strengthen the
analytic base. We will also provide technical assistance in the fields of health and education to
complement investment and DPO policy assistance in these areas. Programmatic public expenditure work
will assist the Government in making critical fiscal choices in line with the evolving needs for fiscal
adjustment. Another critical vulnerability area i s the financial sector where both the Bank and IFC will
work together and with the IMF to provide assistance in further strengthening both the risk framework
within banks and the framework for supervision. The Bank will also work closely with the Government
and other donors on supporting IDP economic integration.
94.
Analytic and advisory work will be equally critical for supporting the medium term growth
and competitiveness strategy. The Country Economic Memorandum on Growth (expected in the first
half o f FY 10) and the recently completed WBG Georgia Manufacturing Sector Competitiveness
Assessment facilitated by IFC will provide important foundations for future work. The Bank will continue
policy support in both transportation and energy regulation. The Bank and IFC will also support the work
under the DPO on facilitating trade through helping the Government develop a strategy as regards
agriculture product certification. The Bank will also work with the Government to follow-up on fiduciary
benchmarking exercises in public expenditures, procurement, and financial reporting processes recently
completed (PEFA, CPA, and Accounting and Auditing ROSC). The Bank will provide additional support
to the Government on improving monitoring and evaluation and communications. IFC will continue
i t s work on deepening the financial markets (including new lending instruments such as energy efficiency
financing) and improving the investment climate with a particular focus on Public-Private Partnerships
(PPPs) in energy and transport, as well as on SMEs. The Bank and the IFC will further explore ways o f
examining and addressing policy barriers to increased agriculture production.

Finally, the Bank Group will seek to provide technical assistance in two cross-cutting areas
- communications and monitoring results. In communications, the Bank Group will
work closely with the Government to assist it in i t s communications and dialogue around key policy
issues. In Monitoring and Evaluation, the Bank will consider supporting statistical improvements both
within the Department o f Statistics and within line Ministries. This would include technical assistance to
the Roads Department to monitor progress and the achievement o f results.

of governance

96.

IFC will provide both direct investment to private companies and investment through
financial intermediaries. I F C has already committed the bulk o f i t s planned crisis-response program in
Georgia’s banking sector in FY09 and will prioritize reaching key sectors in the real economy over the
ensuing period. At the same time it will continue to support the financial sector with other international
partners including EBRD and will respond flexibly to needs that may emerge as the crisis unfolds. IFC
and IDNIBRD programs are already well integrated in Georgia and this will be further developed as new
opportunities open up (see B o x 2). I F C will provide advisory services to support the further development
o f the banking sector and improvements to the business environment, including corporate governance.

97.

M I G A has no currently active projects in Georgia but remains open for business in the country,
seeking to reassure investors through i t s political risk insurance product. MIGA’s standard covers address
risk o f Transfer Restriction, Expropriation, Breach o f Contract and War and C i v i l Disturbance. MIGA i s
also currently exploring building closer links with Georgia’s Investment Risk Management Agency
(IRMA), including in areas such as risk assessment, marketing cooperation, and possible training and
technical assistance.
Box 2: One Bank - IFC and I D M B R D Integrated Programs

IFC and IDNIBRD will explore joint approaches and programs in the following key sectors which would
have a particularly high pay-off over the CPS period:
In the financial sector, The Bank, working with the IMF, will provide analytic support and analysis on the
overall financial sector. IFC will in parallel provide financing and advice mainly to specific systemic
banks both with an eye to ensuring that they are financially strong as well as providing advice on nonperforming loan (NPL) management. IFC will also promote a range o f financing tools including
potentially providing financing for microenterprises and SMEs, household (mortgage) lending, and energy
efficiency lending. By working at both the macro and at the individual bank level and sharing information
across them, subject to investor confidentiality, it i s expected that the effectiveness o f both will be
enhanced.
In the business enabling environment, IFC will complete i t s advisory services program on decreasing the
cost o f doing business. These efforts may be reinforced through inclusion o f related targeted results in the
Bank’s DPO series which will help support improvement in tax and customs administrations and also
support addressing non-tariff barriers to trade including technical barriers to trade. IFC measurement
efforts will be used to help monitor progress under the DPO, while the DPO provides a tool to enhance
dialogue over IFC analysis and proposals. Further, IFC i s likely to provide advisory services on improving
practices related to food safety, complementing the DPO supported framework for improved food
standards and the practical strengthening o f testing laboratories under the Rural Development Project.
In infrastructure, the World Bank will be investing heavily in transport infrastructure through various
highway and road projects, and IFC will explore private investments as well as how public-private
partnerships in the transport sector can extend this effort. Similarly, in energy the World Bank and IFC
will work together to explore the potential for catalyzing private investment and public-private partnerships
in hydropower.

B.

Portfolio management and performance

98.

Total Bank exposure to Georgia amounts to the equivalent o f $1.1 billion, with disbursements
amounting to $973 million. The active portfolio consists o f 10 IDA credits, and one IBRD loan for a total

30

commitment of $295 million, of which about $135 million i s undisbursed. The Bank i s also administering
about 20 trust funds in support of programs.
Portfolio performance has been moderately satisfactory. The disbursement ratio'' of the
99.
portfolio -- a key indicator of overall portfolio performance -- was over 75 percent by end-FY09, well
above the Bank average of about 20 percent. The disbursement rate accelerated during FY09 (from 50
percent at end-FYOS), reflecting the Government's capacity to implement projects and the urgency to
provide countercyclical support during the current downturn. There are currently no projects in
unsatisfactory status, though several were restructured in FY09 (Avian Influenza, Health Reform, Rural
Development). These movements are symptomatic of the fast paced Georgia policy environment, where
Bank programs designed in different circumstances have had to adapt to changing approaches and
priorities. The CPS Completion Report highlights the importance of the Bank remaining agile in a fast
paced environment. It i s clear that in this environment, very active monitoring and supervision will be
necessary to maintain portfolio quality during the new CPS period. Over the CPS period, it i s expected that
the total number of projects in the portfolio will decline significantly. Even considering potential project
extensions, almost all of the ongoing projects are expected to close by the end of the CPS period.

100. Continued strong attention to portfolio and enhanced implementation support will be
required. Infrastructure investments will represent a higher share of portfolio,, requiring more focused
supervision to address quality issues and corruption risks. Supervision would be enhanced through (i)
introduction of risk-based approaches; (ii) more resources for risky projects; (iii)better physical
verification of works; and (iv) a greater reliance on civil society organizations in monitoring and
implementation. Results will be monitored through a series of Portfolio Performance Reviews, to be
conducted regularly with the government.
101. I n addition, country program management has been decentralized , The Country Director for
the South Caucasus relocated to Tbilisi, Georgia, in late FY09. Three additional international staff at the
level of Country Sector Coordinators will also be decentralized by end 2009. IFC has also strengthened i t s
management presence in Tbilisi. Greater effort will be taken to strengthen operations task management in
the field and reinforce program synergies across the South Caucasus countries. Proximity to client and
greater country presence will likely strengthen implementation, policy dialogue, and results on the ground.
102. As regards country systems, in line with the Bank's overall strategic direction it would be
important to continue progressively to move towards these in Georgia, recognizing that it will take time.
The CPS Completion Report highlights the movement away from autonomous project implementation
units towards a more integrated approach in the last CPS, and this evolution will continue under this CPS.
Bank projects currently use the Treasury system for maintaining designated accounts. The Treasury
system has been assessed and complies with basic Bank requirements. Other financial management
responsibilities are handled through regular Bank procedures and project implementing agencies have
overall satisfactory financial management arrangements. As Government improves i t s financial
management systems, the Bank will assess i t s ability to utilize them. This includes the potential for greater
reliance on country accounting systems with the introduction of IPSAS and the potential for greater
reliance on country auditing systems based on improved capacity.

103. I F C has a committed portfolio o f $312 million, of which $242 million i s disbursed (as of June
30, 2009). The portfolio includes 8 clients, primarily in the banking sector but also includes several real
sector clients. Portfolio performance overall has been satisfactory, but the portfolio has been impacted
negatively by the conflict and the current financial crisis and staff i s managing it closely.

Results-Based Monitoring and Evaluation

104. The Bank will use results-based monitoring and evaluation (M&E) to assess how Bank
activities are contributing to results on the ground. Monitoring progress will also enable corresponding
adjustments in the Bank’s lending and non-lending programs. The Bank will also contribute to Georgia’s
own capacity to manage for results. The Bank will support this through the following:

Doing Business), and performance ratings (CPA, PEFA);
Improved multimedia efforts to raise awareness about results through stories o f successful impact.

105. Statistics: Reliable statistics are essential to an effective and transparent development program.
As noted, the Government has recently submitted a new law in Parliament to strengthen statistics including
making the Statistics Agency an independent agency, adoption o f internationally recognized statistical
methods and standards, and improvement in institutional and staff capacity. The DPO series will support
adoption and implementation of this policy, and annual Poverty Assessments will also support such
improvements. The Health and Education Projects are also working on strengthening the statistical
databases in these two fields.

D.

Communications Strategy

106. While Georgia has pursued an impressive and speedy public policy reform approach, it
needs to continue deepening its communication on the rationale for these choices and involve society
in these discussions so as to promote sustainable development. Improved transparency and
participation are fundamental for voice, accountability and good governance. Social awareness and
involvement through communications and outreach can build support that will ultimately enhance the
sustainability of reforms.

107. T o this end, many o f the Bank’s projects will support increased stakeholder feedback and
involvement in order to improve development outcomes. Further, many policies - for example in
social and health sector reforms -- would benefit from transparency and public participation on how they
are being implemented and how citizens can make most use o f them. Therefore, the Bank will scale up i t s
communications strategy on its own work, and assist the Government in doing so more broadly. This
could, for example, include working with the Government and other donors to regularly host workshops
and seminars around key policy issues for a wide audience.

E.

Partnerships

108.
Building and maintaining partnerships with other donors and international institutions will
be critical to the success of the CPS. The CPS Completion Report highlights the importance partnerships
have made during the last CPS to leveraging resources and knowledge and this emphasis will continue and
deepen under this CPS. There are two main elements in this.
0

Post-Conflict Support Follow-up and Coordination: First, the Bank i s playing a leadership role
in following up and coordinating donor flows following the October donors conference. To this
end it will periodically work with other donors to prepare a progress report. The first one was

32

prepared in July 2009 and has been made available to the public. Ensuring that these pledges are
met in a timely and coordinated manner will play a large role in the overall sustainability o f
Georgia’s development strategy. At the donors conference, 38 countries and 15 international
institutions participated and pledged a total o f $4.5 billion over three years. In the period from
August 2008 through April 2009, a total o f $1.7 billion has already been committed.

Sector Specific Coordination: Second, the Bank’s program i t s e l f i s quite focused. Working
closely with other donors w i l l therefore be essential to ensure that the Bank’s operations are
implemented within a wider context o f support. In light o f these efforts, the Bank i s strengthening
coordination in a wide range o f areas as discussed below.

109. Transportation Infrastructure: The Bank i s perhaps most active in supporting coordination in the
area o f transportation. Several international institutions and donors, including ADB, JICA and M C C are
providing support for various segments o f the transportation sector. USAID also has a project in road
safety that it i s coordinating with the World Bank. While these are not directly cofinanced with the World
Bank, the Bank plays a leadership role in convening periodic donor discussions and ensuring this work i s
designed and implemented in a coherent manner. This coordination i s particularly important in ensuring
that donors are providing support within a medium term approach to roads, use common standards in road
construction, and coordinate their approach to road safety as well (see Box 3 for details).
Box 3: The Bank’s Leadership Role in Coordinating Transport Investments in Georgia

The Government’s program to rehabilitate i t s transport corridor and feeder roads i s a multi-donor effort which
requires strong coordination. In the last few years the Bank has taken the lead in organizing annual transport
donor conferences for Georgia and the South Caucasus. The latest Georgia meeting, specifically dedicated to the
road sector, was held in May 2009 co-chaired by the Bank and the Minister of Regional Development and
Infrastructure. The Government’s strategy for the development and financing of the road sector was presented,
and donors’ programs and ways of addressing financing gaps were discussed. The Bank and the Government
have been organizing such meetings on a regular basis in order to keep close coordination between the donors
and the Government. The Bank i s committed to keep leadingthe effort with the government.
Coordination i s particularly important to ensure that each of these segments i s financed with compatible
technical standards, social and environmental safeguards, and road safety measures. For example, the Bank has
developed very close cooperation with two key financiers, the ADB and JICA, on a number of important
matters: (i)The ADB i s considering undertaking a similar road safety activity in their upcoming project on the
E-70 to the one proposed under the Bank-financed Third East-West Highway Improvement Project for the E-60
highway; (ii) The Bank, ADB and JICA agreed to apply similar implementation arrangements developed by the
Bank and the Government, and (iii) the three organizations will coordinate approach on overall TA and training.
The Bank also sponsors an annual transport donor coordination meeting for the three South Caucasus countries
held in Paris. These meetings target all key modes of transport: railways, roads, maritime, and aviation. T h e
most recent such meeting was held in June 2009 and was attended by all key donors active in the region. Donors
have confirmed the high value they see in this cross-country effort and have expressed hope that the Bank will
continue leading this effort.
110.
Macroeconomic Suuuort: The Bank i s working closely with the IMF in development policy
lending and overall economic policy dialogue. The SBA has played a critical role in supporting Georgia’s
overall macroeconomic situation. The Bank’s DPO program i s also being cofinanced by the Netherlands.
The EU and the ADB also provide substantial parallel budget support. The World Bank w i l l continue to
monitor the macroeconomic situation in close collaboration with the IMF, including periodically updating
i t s joint debt sustainability analysis, as well as fiscal efficiency.

33

111.
IDPs: A wide range o f donors are assisting in providing support to IDPs in the aftermath o f the
conflict including the UN, USAID, KfW, the EU and the World Bank. The Government has taken the lead
in coordinating these efforts to ensure compatibility in housing and related assistance, with the IDP
Steering Committee convened by the Ministry o f Refugees and Accommodation playing a key role.
112. Financial and Private Sector: The IMF and the World Bank are working together on the financial
sector, which plays a critical role in the IMF program. This i s complemented by lending, equity and
technical assistance support,by IFC, EBRD and ADB. IFC and EBRD have been working particularly
closely in providing coordinated investment funding to the largest systemically important banks. IFC also
relies on CIDA and BP for their support for advisory work on the business enabling environment and
corporate governance.
113. Public Sector Management: The World Bank finances the Public Sector Financial Management
Reform Support Project together with other donors including DFID, SIDA and the Netherlands. The Bank
and the EU also jointly prepared a Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) analysis and
benchmarking. The EU i s also providing parallel technical assistance to assist the Government in meeting
DPO benchmarks on multi-year budget planning. GTZ i s providing parallel technical assistance to the
Chamber o f Control to assist in aligning audit methodology as per the requirements o f the new law.

114. MuniciDal Infrastructure: The World Bank helped to establish the Municipal Development Fund
(MDF) which has since evolved into the premier channel by which various donors channel funds.
Through this mechanism the ADB and the EBRD are providing parallel support to Bank funds through the
MDF. The US MCC i s also providing funds through the MDF, and has contracted with the World Bank to
supervise implementationo f i t s funds for a fee. Sweden i s also providing support on water supply.
Enerm Infrastructure: The World Bank Group has been preparing a feasibility study for a
115.
particular hydropower operation along the Khudoni River. In parallel, the EBRD and EIB have been
reviewing the potential o f other hydropower operations and KfW, EBRD and EIB are considering
supporting the construction o f a large regional high voltage power transmission line to Turkey. USAID i s
reviewing the potential for gas storage. The Government i s taking the lead in coordinating these efforts to
ensure all o f these pieces fit together in a coherent strategy.
116. Education: The Japanese funded PHRD fund i s providing an implementation grant attached to the
Bank project that provides critical technical assistance funds to complement Bank provided investment
funds. Other donors providing parallel technical assistance, including in the field o f vocational education,
include USAID, KfW, EC, UNICEF, UNDP, SIDA, and the Netherlands.

117. Health: Health care reform agenda i s being supported by different donors and international
organizations, e.g. USAID, EC, Open Society, Global Fund, and various UN agencies.
118. Agriculture: The World Bank’s Rural Development Project i s cofinanced with F A D and a
Japanese funded PHRD grant. Other donors providing significant assistance in this area include USAID,
EC, FAO, UN, SIDA and MCC. Sweden will provide analytic support for land registration and food
safety and testing, and this will be coordinated with the Bank’s DPO and agriculture efforts.
V.

Creditworthiness and Risks

119. The largest risk is that the downturn could be longer and deeper than anticipated. The
proposed strategy i s premised on a temporary downturn, during which it would be appropriate to support
an economic stimulus to enable Georgia to maintain priority investments and social programs. Continued
deep reforms would enable growth and foreign investment to pick up after this period with less

34

governmental and donor financing needed. However, investor confidence, key to the Government’s
strategy of mobilizing private capital inflows, has been weakened by the global downturn and i s sensitive
to political developments, both domestic and regional. In the event of weaker than anticipated foreign
investment and hence a more prolonged downturn than anticipated, the Government would need to adjust
its approach in the following areas, and the Bank would need to support this adjustment, in close
coordination with the IMF:
0

0

0

Fiscal: The large fiscal deficit in FY09 i s an appropriate countercyclicalmeasure that i s supported
by increased donor funding. However, if there i s a longer than anticipated downturn, the
Government will need to further prioritize expenditures and undertake fiscal adjustment. This i s
one reason that the Bank has made the improvement o f resource management, including the
introduction o f results based budgeting, a central part o f its strategy. The Bank will continue to
monitor the situation closely and will as part of its dialogue around the DPO provide advice to the
Government on the public investment program, ensuring that continued support for basic social
assistance i s maintained. The IMF-supported program provides a framework for an orderly
adjustment in the medium-term.
Public external debt going into the crisis had come down to about 18 percent o f GDP in
2007, providing a cushion for the Government to take on more debt to support fiscal expenditures.
Increased donor and international institutional financing i s not generally expected to overburden
the Government - about half o f donor funding pledged in October 2008 are grants and the rest i s
either concessional or long term market-based loans. As a result, though public debt to GDP i s
expected to rise to the range o f 40 percent in the next few years, debt levels are projected to stay
within prudential thresholds. However, difficulties in restoring market access would complicate a
challenging debt service profile due to the fact that a peak o f repurchases to the IMF coincides
with a $500 million Eurobond maturing in 2013. With an expected pickup o f growth and foreign
investment over the medium term, these repayments are manageable. However, if growth and
foreign investment continue to be constrained over the medium term, the Government will need to
engage in careful debt management to ensure sustainability. Debt management will remain a
central part of our dialogue with the Government. The Bank and the IMF will continue to work
on the Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) during 2009 to further build the basis for good hebt
management policies. The Bank’s Treasury Department i s also providing support on debt
management.
j&t:

Financial: During FY09, IFC, EBRD and others provided strong support to systemically
important commercial banks to ensure that immediate repayment obligations were met. Near term
risks have thus receded but the sector remains vulnerable to an extended downturn. IFC i s
providing technical support directly to banks on managing liquidity and non-performing loans.
Although IFC will seek to diversify its support towards real sector investments during the CPS
period, it remains committed to supporting the financial sector as needed. The ADB i s also
discussing possible support to the banking sector. If foreign private investment i s not available at
past levels to support lending growth, the Bank Group will work with the Government to help
expand domestic resource mobilization.

Prior to the August
120. Economic uncertainties will also affect Georgia’s creditworthiness:
conflict, Georgia’s creditworthiness had been improving and it was able to issue a large Eurobond in 2008
that was significantly oversubscribed. Notwithstanding Georgia’s impressive achievements in
macroeconomic policy and performance and structural reforms prior to the dual crises, Georgia’s
creditworthiness since then has been constrained by domestic and regional tensions which have
undermined investor confidence and private capital inflows. Prospects for a medium term recovery and
35

improved creditworthiness in the post-crisis period would be promoted by adequate policy adjustment and
an easing o f regional and domestic tensions.

121. The availability of Bank resources represents another source of risk. The current resource
envelope has been frontloaded and has been set conservatively, without pre-judging the potential for either
continued access to IDA under IDA-16, or improved access to IBRD. As a result, without a change in this
envelope, the Bank would have very little new resources (outside o f IFC funding) to make available to
Georgia in the outer years o f the CPS. If growth increases as planned, and Georgia’s creditworthiness
indicators improve, access to market based resources could be strengthened. On the other hand, if the
situation develops where increased access to market based resources including IBRD i s more limited,
access to IDA-16 might be considered. Ensuring adequate resources across the Bank Group will be a key
element o f the mid-term review o f the CPS to ensure that the Bank continues to have adequate instruments
to support Georgia.
122.
Beyond these key risks, there are other issues that bear watching. While the Government’s
commitment to move forward on policy reforms i s clear, there i s a need to continue strengthening
communications and dialogue with civil society to ensure that policy reforms have a strong foundation of
support across the political spectrum. Improving communications i s therefore a central element o f the
CPS. On the portfolio side, while all projects are currently in satisfactory status the speed at which policy
reforms have been implemented have led to significant restructuring needs in the past, and this i s expected
to continue to be the case in the future. Close attention to portfolio matters i s therefore needed and will be
facilitated by greater decentralization and field presence. Finally, Georgia i s vulnerable to natural resource
risks such as flooding, drought, earthquakes and cross-border diseases. The Bank will remain flexible in
i t s approach to respond to any such emergency.

Annex 2: GEORGIA -- CPS COMPLETION REPORT: FY06-09

1.
This Country Partnership Strategy Completion Report (CPSCR) evaluates Bank Group
assistance to Georgia for FY06-FY09. The CPS (report number 33295-GE) was discussed by the
Board in September 2005. A CPS progress report (report number 43354-GE) discussed by the Board
in June 2008 assessed progress in implementing the CPS and indicated were revisions of the program
were needed. This Completion Report examines the relevance of the CPS to Georgia’s longer term
goals, the achievement of CPS outcomes, and Bank Group performance in furthering the CPS
outcomes. The report draws on project appraisal, supervision and completion reports and the
evaluations o f IEG, including an CAE prepared in 2007. Other sources include the Government’s
own assessments, the IMF program documents, various national and international studies and
surveys, as well as inputs from former and current Government officials, other stakeholders in
Georgia, and the Bank country team.
I.

Relevance o f CPS

Background

2.
The Rose Revolution in November 2003 was a defining moment for Georgia. The new
Government o f Mikhail Saakashvili that was swept into power inherited a near failed state. Georgia
under President Eduard Shevardnadze was an early reformer. From 1992 to the turn o f the century a
range o f economic and political reforms were implemented to set Georgia on the path to a market
economy and democracy. However, by the early 2000s, reform momentum sputtered to a halt.
Political power was increasingly fragmented, corruption and crime had skyrocketed and tax revenues
had plummeted giving rise to massive arrears in pension payments and teacher’s salaries. Also,
infrastructure f e l l into a state o f near collapse, with most o f the country without power, and the road
network increasingly deteriorated.
3.
The new Government moved quickly to reverse the deterioration. They quickly restored
macro-economic stability and improved fiscal discipline and revenue collection which enabled them
to eliminate arrears and pay bills. The Government also launched aggressive reforms in the social
sector and o f the administrative and regulatory regime facing the private sector. Importantly, the
Government signaled a major war on corruption by sacking the entire traffic police force and
replacing it with a completely new patrol police structure and followed up by holding Minister’s
accountable for cleaning up corruption in their ministries, and developing a comprehensive national
anti-corruption strategy. The early reforms yielded remarkable results. Growth rebounded by 2005,’
tax revenues grew from 14 % in 2003 to nearly 20% in 2005, and external debt f e l l sharply.
Moreover, CPIA scores improved dramatically for both 2004 and 2005.
4.
Nevertheless key challenges still faced the Government in the 2006 - 2009 period. First,
Growth, though accelerating had yet to increase employment, particularly in the rural areas. Second,
the poor state o f infrastructure, particularly roads and energy supply, continued to have a detrimental
impact on the economy and public welfare. Third, far reaching reforms in education, health and
social protection were progressing but further work was needed to sustain the momentum in these key
areas. Finally, public administration reforms needed to progress further, particularly in budgeting and
expenditure management, intergovernmental fiscal relations, procurement and financial management,
the judicial system, and civil service management.
The Government Strategy

5.
The previous Government had completed a PRSP, entitled the Economic Development and
Poverty Reduction Program (EDPRP) just prior to the Rose Revolution. The new Government

43

acknowledged the EDPRP and broadly accepted the analysis in the report,
To help direct
expenditures to priority areas, the new Government developed a Basic Data and Directions document
(BDD) that was used to kick o f f each year’s budget cycle in the context o f a newly adopted mediumterm expenditure framework. The BDD spelled out the Government’s strategy over a three year
rolling time frame, and contained strategic priorities that were all broadly in line with the EDPRP.
Priority areas identified in the BDD were rehabilitation o f the road network, reform o f basic
education, improvements in the social protection system, strengthening of public sector management
and improvement o f the business environment through regulatory and administrative reform. An
overarching objective was to continue Government wide efforts to eliminate corruption.

The 2006 2009 CPS Design

6.
The CPS design supported the Government’s long terms goals o f reducing extreme and
overall poverty and improving living standards. Support for these goals focused on two areas where it
was felt the World Bank Group had comparative advantage: (i) enabling income and employment
generating growth; and (ii)improving human development and social protection. The CPS also
focused on one intermediate objective -- improving efficiency in public services. These three areas
formed the pillars o f the CPS. Addressing corruption and governance issues was seen as an
overarching theme that was to be addressed in each o f the three pillars.

7.
The program consisted o f a mix o f policy based and investment lending supported by
analytical work. The Bank and the Government agreed to narrow the focus o f Bank assistance to a
few key areas as it was felt the portfolio going into the new CPS period was too fragmented. As a
result, the number o f investment loans under implementation declined from 19 to 11 over the CPS
period.
Identified R i s k s

8.
The CPS identiJedJive risks, all of which were considered to be moderate. First, a slowing
o f the reform process was deemed a risk arising from a possible lack o f political will to overcome
vested interests or political instability. This possibility weighed heavily on the minds o f the
Government, which believed it only had a limited window o f opportunity to act before political costs
began to limit its ability to act boldly. Second, the CPS identified a fiduciary risk given past
Government failure at expenditure management. The quick and substantial progress in expenditure
management and fighting corruption was the product of strong leadership and commitment across the
Government and broad public support. The concern was whether political and popular support for
strong anti-corruption measures could be sustained. Third was the risk o f civil conflict. The CPS
noted that existing regional tensions would continue until a permanent resolution to the crisis was
found and as a result a degree o f uncertainty would exist that would affect the welfare o f the people
and act as a drag on the investment and business environment. Fourth, the CPS saw a risk of a
deteriorating external environment. The CPS cited as examples o f such risk the possible collapse in
external markets or disruptions in oil gas, or energy supplies. Thefinal risk indentified by the CPS
was natural calamities. In the previous CAS period Georgia had been afflicted at various times by
floods, drought and earthquakes all o f which set back development progress.
Overall Assessment of CPS Relevance
This CPSCR rates the CPS design and the identiJcation of risks as Satisfactory. The CPS
9.
design was fully consistent with the new Government’s priority and reflected high Government
ownership of the program. Overall, the Bank was able to deliver significantly more resources and a
larger number o f investments then anticipated in the CPS due both to Georgia’s excellent results in
the performance based allocation mechanism and i t s quick accession to IBRD status. In fact Georgia
went from receiving half i t s resources in FY05 as IDA grants due to its status as a fragile state, to

44

IBRD eligible in three years. Overall, nearly $337 million in credits and loans were approved during
the CPS period compared to the $143 programmed in the CPS report. Moreover, the design o f the
CPS proved to be robust. It was able to accommodate Georgia’s rapidly evolving reform program,
allowed the Bank Group to ramp up lending as more resources became available and provided crucial
support to Georgia in the aftermath o f the August 2008 crisis in the context of a coordinated multidonor response. The risks identified by the CPS were relevant especially the risk o f regional conflict
and the risk o f deteriorating external environment. While in hindsight the risk rating for these two
factors could have been set higher then moderate, the design of the CPS has proven to be sufficiently
resilient to help mitigate the effects o f the twin calamities that befell Georgia. Remarkably, most
targets in the CPS were achieved, and many exceeded despite the twin shocks showing both the
strength o f the CPS design and the determined efforts o f Government to overcome the obstacles
thrown its way.

11.

Results Assessment

10.
The CPS period covers two distinct time segments - the first 38 months up to August 2008
where reforms, growth, investments were all on a strong upward trajectory - and the last 10 months
where the August 2008 conflict, followed closely by the global economic crisis created a serious
challenge for the Government in terms o f declining economic growth, falling FDI and tax revenues,
and increases o f poverty and unemployment. The Government’s ability to meet this challenge i s
bolstered by strong performance in macro-economic management and i t s aggressive reform agenda.
Strong donor support following the August crisis i s also helping to mitigate the impact of the twin
shocks.
A. Overall Development Outcomes

11.
Enabling Income and Employment Generating Growth. With the exception o f the last 10
months, long term growth exceeded expectations in the CPS. In fact, growth in the first three years
covered by the CPS (FY06-FY08, was more than double projections in the CPS and for the overall
CPS period average growth exceeded expectations. The growth did create jobs, particularly in the
financial and construction sectors, but gains were offset by labor shedding elsewhere, particularly in
the public sector so that overall employment levels stayed stable, while labor productivity likely
increased. Growth in the rural sector also continued to lag. Since the twin shocks, economic growth
has slipped and unemployment has increased. But Government actions to increase public
investments, restart credit flows in the banking system and expand targeted benefits are helping to
mitigate the impact of the events o f the last few months. Moreover, debt levels are quite low which i s
helping create some space in dealing with the crises. More importantly the CPS’ medium term
outcomes were for the most part achieved or exceeded laying a strong foundation for job creation
once the Georgian economy begins recovery. That said the down-side risks are substantial. A further
deterioration in the global economic climate, an unexpected crisis in the financial sector, or continued
political tensions could prolong the economic slide significantly and delay Georgia’s recovery.
Fostering Human Development and Improving Social Protection. Social sector reforms
12.
have been significant, and in many instances the reforms outstripped what had been envisaged in the
CPS. Expenditures for health education and social protection increased steadily throughout the CSP
period with the share o f the state budget going to the social sectors increasing to 36 percent in the
2009 budget, up from less than 30 percent in the 2005. For education outcomes, assessments o f
student learning based on international exams are just beginning, so it i s not possible to draw
conclusions at this time about trends in education outcomes. Nevertheless, the nearly completed
introduction of the new curriculum, continued extensive teacher training, improved assessments, and
greater local autonomy in financing and management o f schools all point to a strong likelihood of
improvement in outcomes in the coming years. Health sector reforms were characterized by f i t s and

45

starts early in the CPS, followed by a major reform push in the last two years that has emphasized
private provision o f health services and a limited role for the state as a regulator and policy
formulation. Significant progress has been made in health care financing with the launching o f three
tiered health care financing approach including a basic benefit package funded by the state for the
poor, state insurance for certain civil servants, voluntary participation in private plans partially
subsidized by the state, and private insurance for those in the formal sector. Social protection
measures have also been improved with the introduction o f targeted social benefit package aimed at
the extreme poor consisting o f a cash payment and a basic medical benefits package. Pensions have
also been increased.

Improving Efficiency of Public Services. Solid outcomes were achieved in improved
13.
public budgeting and expenditure management and better inter-governmental fiscal relations. Judicial
reforms have progressed, especially in the last two years, though a widespread perception still persists
that courts lack independence. Bank-Group involvement in judicial system during CPS period was
limited and confined to the first year o f the CPS. Other donors, namely the US, UNDP and EU have
continued to support judicial reform and their efforts appear to be gaining traction. Progress has been
made on financial management and procurement though issues s t i l l remain to be tackled.

14.
Reducing Extreme and Overall Poverty. The three goals covered by the three pillars of the
CPS aimed at helping achieve the Government’s overall goal o f reducing extreme and overall
poverty. The just completed Georgia Poverty Assessment uses available data to measure poverty
levels and trends. A Living Standards Measurement Survey (LSMS) financed by the Bank in 2007
shows overall poverty at 23.7 percent and extreme poverty at 9.3 percent. Poverty i s concentrated in
rural areas, specifically in the northern mountainous arc. While these numbers are lower than those
reported by the Department o f Statistics, they are not directly comparable. Other data, namely on real
household monetary incomes, however, strongly suggest declining poverty over from 2003 through
2007. Over this period Real Household Monetary income grew on average 7.9 percent. Increases
were larger in rural areas then in urban areas and were largest for the lowest quintile o f the population
largely as a result o f the introduction o f the targeted social assistance program. Non-income
indicators o f poverty such as access to infrastructure and social services also improved significantly
over the period. Improved supplies o f power, available on a two-tier pricing structure with low tariffs
for low consumption levels, better roads, access to the basic benefits package for health, and
improved administration o f social benefits all made life a bit easier for the poor.
15.
Impact on Poverty of the August Events and the World Economic Crisis: The double
shocks o f the August 2008 conflict and the global financial crisis risk undermining Georgia’s poverty
reduction efforts. As a result o f these shocks the poverty headcount i s forecasted to go up from 23.7
percent in 2007 to 27.8 percent in 2009. Were it not for the negative welfare impacts o f the twin
crises, the poverty headcount in Georgia could have been expected to decline from 23.7 percent in
2007 to 19.2 percent at the end o f 2009. This 2009 gap in the “crisis” poverty headcount versus “a no
crisis” poverty headcount represents in absolute terms about 350,000 poor people.
16.
Progress toward the Millennium Development Goals. Prior to the impact o f the twin
shocks, Georgia was on a path to achieve most, if not all millennium goals, and despite the recent
setbacks it may well achieve all goals, though the impact o f the crises on poverty i s indeed substantial
and will be difficult to overcome in the near term. In other areas, good progress have been made in
reducing infant and maternal mortality, and with the educational reform underway Georgia stands
poised for a significant improvement in education outcomes. Gender equality also broadly exists.

B. Overview of Results Delivered by the CPS program.

17.
The CPS program had three pillars; (i)Enabling Income and Employment Generating
Growth; (ii)Improving Human Development and Social Protection; and (iii)Improving Efficiency in
Public Service. This CPS Completion Report finds that the results for each o f the three pillars were
satisfactory.
Pillar 1: Enabling Income and Employment Generating Growth

18.
Within Pillar 1, the CPS focused on six specific areas: (i)Addressing corruption and
governance issues; (ii)removing administrative barriers to PSD; (iii)improving electricity and gas
infrastructure; (iv) improving highway infrastructure; (v) improving access to rural infrastructure and
services; and (vi) sustainable uses o f forestry and other natural resources. The Beeps surveys for
2002 showed problems in nearly all these areas, which, while beginning to be addressed at the outset
o f the CPS period were all still relevant areas of focus.
19.
The operational instruments to deliver the assistance included a Poverty Reduction Support
Operation (PRSO) series o f credits and grants, investment operations in the power, transport,
municipal infrastructure, rural, forestry and natural resources sectors and analytical work. Among the
analytical work, the Programmatic Poverty Assessment supported Government efforts to improve
social protection measures and better target assistance to the poor. IFC provided financing to
commercial banks, and for airport construction and real estate development. IFC technical assistance
and advisory services were provided to improve the business environment through FIAS and PEP.
The four PRSO operations, plus one Supplement following the August 2008 conflict focused on four
areas - (i)strengthening public sector accountability, efficiency and transparency; (ii) improving
electricity and gas sector services; (iii)improving the environment for private sector development and
(iv) improving social protection, health and education.
1A. Addressing Corruption and GovernanceIssues Affecting the Business Environment

20.
The CPS highlighted that corruption had so tainted the business environment that it drove up
the cost of doing business, limited foreign capital inflows and distorted resource allocation. To
improve the business environment the CPS identified measures aimed at reducing the opportunities
for corruption at points of service such as customs, inspections, licensing, taxation, and the court
system. The CPS results matrix uses BEEPS 2002, 2005 and 2008 to measure results. The analysis
i s complicated by the fact that the 2008 results are not comparable to the earlier surveys due to
changes in methodologies and in the questionnaire. Surveys of voter attitudes conducted by the
International Republican Institute (IRI) also provide useful information on the level o f corruption.
Doing Business and other surveys compliment the analysis. Finally, Transparency International’s
corruption perception index provides a good snap shot o f evolving corruption perceptions in Georgia.

2 1.
The evidence is unequivocal. Corruption as a corrosiveforce on the business climate has
been greatly reduced. A strong commitment across Government and a willingness to act boldly to
fight corruption sent a signal that reverberated throughout society that the old ways o f doing business
were over. The abrupt firing o f the traffic police was the first shot in a continuing war to end
corruption in the provision o f public services for businesses. Other key achievements including:
streamlining customs and overhauling licensing, permits, and inspections eliminated many
opportunities for rent seeking behavior. Overall, beginning in 2004 and carrying through the CPS
period there has been a dramatic drop in the incidence o f bribe taking, the level o f bribe tax,
unofficial payments for services, and the percentage o f f i r m s reporting corruption as a problem o f
doing business. IFC assisted in the area o f corporate governance by providing technical assistance to
the securities commission to help improve financial reporting by firms, and to the Georgian Stock
Exchange and the Georgian Association o f Banks to develop a voluntary corporate governance code
for Georgian Banks.

Sweeping reforms of administrative regulations, licensing requirements, and inspections
reduced the costs of doing business and jump-started the flow of foreign and domestic investments.
Legislation at the beginning o f the CAS period slashed the number o f licenses and permits from about

900 to 150 and introduced one stop shops for licenses and permits and adopted the principle o f
“silence i s consent”. In 2006 the customs tariffs were abolished on about 90 percent o f imported items
b y reducing the number o f tariff bands from 16 to three (0,512 percent) and a new customs code was
passed in January 2007 which provided the framework for overhauling and streamlining customs
procedures. The customs department was also reorganized and restaffed. The combination o f
simplified customs regime, streamlined procedures and improved technical capacity o f the customs
service has reduced corruption, and significantly reduced processing time. Significant progress was
also made in establishing internationally accepted accreditation and standard certification
mechanisms in line with WTO and EU standards. Georgia also passed a new Company law and
introduced a new property registry. Overall, at the beginning o f the CPS period Georgia was mired
near the bottom o f the D o i n g Business rankings, wallowing in 118” place out o f 178 countries in
2005. It was the top reformer in the world 2006 moving up to 37 and it cracked the top 20 in 2007 at
18. In 2008 it moved to 15” place and as a result o f its performance over the last five year’s Georgia
was named the region’s top reformer. In many categories Georgia was ranked with or even ahead o f
many O E C D countries. For ease o f registering property it was number 2 in the w o r l d and it was
number 4 for ease o f starting a business.

The Financial Sector experienced strong growth in thefirst three and a halfyears of the
CPSperiod, growing by more than three fold. The twin shocks o f the August 2008 conflict and the
international economic crisis have led to a contraction in the Banking sector in the last 10 months, but
financing from IFC, EBRD, FMO and OPIC to the two largest banks, aggressive provisioning and
careful supervision by the Financial Supervision Agency (FSA) have positioned Georgian banks well
to weather the crisis and resume prudent expansion o f lending as the crisis abates. IFC supports four

50

banks with financing (TBC, Procredit, Bank o f Georgia, and Bank Republic) and has products aimed
at financial leasing and mortgage financing. It i s also providing direct financing for a major shopping
and residential center in Tbilisi and helped finance construction o f Tbilisi’s new airport. Societe

“From Collapse to Rebirth” could be the headline for the story of the transformation of
Electricity and Gas Infrastructure in Georgia. Progress in rehabilitating and improving
management o f the energy infrastructure has been remarkable. Under the PRSO program the
Government prepared a medium-term strategy for the energy sector and updated it regularly. The
51

strategy provided a blue print o f actions including urgent rehabilitation o f distribution and
transmission infrastructure for electricity and for the north-south gas pipeline, which at the beginning
o f the CPS period was dangerously close to total collapse. The action plan also called for extensive
metering o f both the gas and electricity distribution systems which when combined with strong
political support for energy companies’ efforts to instill payment discipline dramatically improved
revenue inflows. Payment rates went from less than 20 percent o f billed consumption in the regions
to over 90 percent during the CPS period, and the improved revenue stream helped finance further
renovations o f the system. System outages steadily improved in the power sector going from 20
hours per day to virtually 24/7 power supply for paying customers. The turnaround in the sector
allowed the Government to privatize energy generation and distribution in 2007; with the state
assuming a largely regulatory role (the Government still owns the transmission system for electricity,
the main gas pipelines, and some generation capacity deemed to be strategic). Ongoing private
investment in power generation capacity has transformed Georgia from a power importer to a power
exporter in the last two years. Bank financing for the energy sector has helped to rehabilitate the
power distribution system and the gas pipeline. World Bank and other IF1 financing o f three
international management contractors for the major power sector utilities was essential for the
sector’s return to financial viability and 24 hours o f electricity supply. An ongoing operation i s
helping to improve the efficiency o f the electric transmission system through the implementation of a
modern electricity dispatch system.

Rehabilitation of the road network is one of the Government’s biggest priorities and a
25.
major success. Surveys indicate that improvements o f the road network, along with improved power
supply are rated as the Government’s major successes. Government believes that a rehabilitated and
well-maintained road network i s key to Georgia’s development as a transit corridor and important
especially for the rural economy where access to markets i s crucial. A major focus o f the
Government’s roads program i s the East-West highway from the Azerbaijan border t o Poti, where it
joins the North-South road running along the Black Sea Coast, through Adjara to Turkey and the
Bank’s program during the CPS period supported for road rehabilitation, both for the East-West
highway and for local and secondary roads, many o f which feed into the East-West corridor. The
Roads Department proved to be an experienced and capable client that ensured that the three Bankfinanced projects were implemented on time and to high quality standards. The investments also
contributed significantly to the Road’s Department’s planning capacity, including state o f the art
maintenance management systems. The Bank projects also supported development o f a road safety
strategy, and included financing for investments to correct “black spots” where there was a high
incidence o f accidents. Finally, the roads program has been one element o f the Government’s
economic stimulus package initiated this year in response tp the August 2008 conflict and world
economic crisis. With Georgia’s first IBRD loan, the Government continued the program o f
secondary and local rehabilitation based on designs developed under the first phase. The quick startup o f this “shovel-ready” project i s expected to have significant employment impact.

Progress remains modest in improving rural services and fostering growth in the rural
economy. Growth in agriculture, which employs about half the workforce, has been slow, even
negative at times, over the CPS period. The break-up o f the Soviet U n i o n made Georgia a nation o f
small farmers which helped to cushion the shock o f economic collapse. Government agricultural
services were slow to adapt to the new agricultural regime, and efforts to find a correct balance o f
public and private sector provision o f services have gained little traction over the years. Bank
assistance for Agriculture focused on improving the system for agricultural research, creating a
system o f financing rural enterprise, helping to develop agricultural markets, including export
markets, through supply chain interventions, and rehabilitating irrigation and drainage infrastructure
and creating sustainable structures for the operation and maintenance o f rehabilitated system.
Outcomes are mixed and uncertain.
Support for agricultural research was successful in creating a state-the-arts wine and
horticultural institute that today i s at the heart o f Georgia’s efforts to diversify its wine markets after
the Russian market was closed to Georgian wines. It also succeeded in introducing a method o f
competitive grant financing o f scientific research that n o w has been adopted nationwide. In general,
though, agricultural research remains underfunded, and the model introduced for the Wine and
Horticultural Institute has not been exported to other fields o f research.

27.

28.

The Irrigation and Drainage Community Development Project, the first operation in an A P L
series, closed on April 30, 2009. I t was successful in completing rehabilitation o f all the planned
irrigation and drainage works, and with additional financing was able to help with urgent
reconstruction o f flood control works following the floods o f 2005. The sustainability o f the
investments is, however, at risk. Amelioration Associations (AA) were not developed under the
project into fully technically and financially sustainable organizations that could take charge o f the
management o f lower-order infrastructure and would be able to increasingly pay for the irrigation and
drainage services. The Government revised its policy mid-way through project implementation
which led to reduced support for AAs. The government agency responsible for the operation and
maintenance o f higher-order infrastructure was abolished at the end o f 2006 and instead four stateowned self-financing water management companies (LTDs) were established in an effort to improved
service delivery and ensure sustainability.

29.

At project closure, few A A s were functioning w e l l and there might be a risk that much o f the
lower-order infrastructure rehabilitated by the project will deteriorate for lack o f funds and a reliable
management organization. The LTDs had limited working capital and remit to function as profitable
enterprises. The performance during the past two years has shown that the LTDs do not have the staff
and funds to adequately carry out its functions. As a result, satisfactory systems for collection o f
water user fees and maintenance o f the systems have yet to be developed. The situation continues to
evolve, and it i s hoped that the Bank, by staying engaged in the sector through dialogue and possibly

54

further investment, could help to develop satisfactory arrangements t o assure the sustainability o f the
investments.

30.
The work on rural financing and supply chain development continues. Components o f the
Rural Development project dealing with financing through commercial lenders and microfinance
institutions are proceeding well, though the financial crisis has slowed lending in the last six months.
Work on the supply chain has gotten o f f to a slower start but it i s hoped that changes in project design
now being considered will help get this aspect o f the project moving.

31.
Progress in enabling sustainable use of forestry and other natural resources was
inadequate. A bright spot was the Protected Areas Development Project ((GEF), which was
successful in strengthening Georgia’s capacity for managing a national network o f protected areas,
and help in the establishment o f several new protected areas. Infrastructure, institutional capacity,
and the legal framework for Georgia’s protected areas have all been improved as a result o f the
pro-ject.
55

32.
The Coastal Zone Management Project made progress towards improving environmental
planning along the Black Sea, but the project closed without ensuring a strong legal and institutional
framework for coastal zone planning and management.
33.
The forestry project had made a good start at the beginning and look poised to help
strengthen forestry management and foster sustainable utilization o f forest resources. But the project
stalled when the Government decided to embark o n a radical shift in policy directions. The
Government basically wanted to move to long term leases as the principal management tool for
commercial forests. While the new approach was basically consistent with the projects development
direction, Bank management concluded that important pre-conditions for success o f the new approach
were not in place, namely completion o f a nationwide forestry inventory, and adequate lease
monitoring mechanisms. As the policy differences could not be bridged, the project was suspended
and ultimately cancelled. Interestingly, in recent months the Government has begun the process o f
drafting a forest sector development policy, and redrafting the forest lease legislation. The policy
draft and revised legislation, if adopted, would likely address most o f the Bank’s concerns with the
earlier approach.

Rating of Pillar One - Satisfactory
The CPSCR rates outcomes under Pillar One as satisfactory. The pillar was intended to
34.
create an enabling environment for income and employment generating growth and the outcomes,
particularly for corruption and governance, removing administrative barriers, improving Jinancial
services, and improvements in gas, power and transport infiastructure, were highly satisfactory and
contributed to an improved environment for business and private sector-led growth. The Bank
programs contributed to the success of the reforms, both through the PRSO series but also through
investment lending in infiastructure and energy. Growth in incomes was indeed strong through mid2008 due to Government reforms supported by the Bank, and employment creation in growth sectors
such asjnance, telecoms and construction was strong, though masked by labor shedding in other
sectors. The fallout f i o m the August 2008 conflict and the global economic downturn has slowed
growth, and reversed some employment gains, but the reforms of the last four years has helped
position Georgia to weather the crisis and return to a positive growth path as global conditions
improve. Growth in agriculture remained low throughout the CPS period resecting the dlfJicult
challenges facing the rural sector and perhaps the low priority given to agriculture by the
Government. I n this context it is not surprising that the elements of the pillar dealing with the rural
economyfared less well than others.

Improving Human Development and Social Protection

35.
T o support Government priorities in social services, the CPS was designed to assist structural
improvements in health, education and social protection. The long term objectives o f the Bank’s
interventions in human development were: (i) improved health and education outcomes; (ii)
improved protection o f the poor and vulnerable through an efficient and effective targeted social
assistance system; and (iii)establishment o f a sustainable solution for protection against poverty in
old age. Medium t e r m objectives focused on increased quality and quantity o f public expenditures
for social services; improved access to high quality and affordable public social services; and
improved targeting o f social assistance. The instruments to meet these objectives were investment
projects in health and education, the PRSO series which had improvement o f social services as one o f
i t s four pillars, and a programmatic poverty assessment,

Corruption and governance in the social services has been sharply reduced at the point of
service delivery. The standardized university entrance exam, in part financed by the Bank, was one o f
the first anti-corruption salvos fired by the new Government which virtually eliminated bribery in the
entrance process. N o w the exam system i s being extended to master’s program. Another initiative by

the Government that provided greater oversight was decentralizing financial and management control
to the school level with oversight provided by local school boards. Improvements in the system for
social transfers reduced opportunities for theft and rent seeking activities.

Deep and abiding commitment to reform o f the education management system is
yielding results. The Bank through i t s PRSO series and the Education APLs has been a key partner
i s assisting the Government with i t s sweeping and ambitious reform efforts for basic education. The
curriculum has been overhauled and i s now in the final stages o f implementation, with the new
curriculum introduced in all classes except 4, 5 and 6, where phased piloting and implementation o f
the new curriculum i s underway. In parallel, teachers are now much better paid and are being trained
in the new curriculum, exams for teacher certification are under preparation and new class room
materials and text books have been prepared. Some 72 education resource centers situated throughout
Georgia are assisting in the roll-out and training.
38.
Student assessments are an integral element o f the reform process, and with Bank support a
National Assessment Center has been established and it i s spearheading an effort to introduce
international assessments o f student learning outcomes. The Center did its first assessment o f reading
skills o f Children 9 to 10 years old in 2003 based on the PIRLS framework and methodology,
followed by Georgia’s first participation in the PIRLS and TIMSS (Math). The PIRLS results for
2006 showed a small improvement over 2003 but showed that Georgia still scored poorly in
international comparisons, which i s not surprising given that the reforms were in early stages.
Participation in international assessments in 20 1 1 should give the first real gauge o f progress.
39.

Education management and financing has been overhauled with the implementation o f precapita financing and decentralization o f school management and accountability. Over 800,000
parents participated in the first elections o f local school boards in 2007.

The Bank also assisted the Government in preparing an education strategy for 2007 - 20 1 1 on
the basis o f which i t was admitted into the Education Fast Track Initiative in 2007. Finally, the Bank
help establish an International School o f Economics (ISET) which offers a Master’s Degree in
Economics based on international standards. ISET has just graduated i t s second class with students

The new
Government inherited a health system where the state was nominally the provider and financier o f
most health services, but where in fact most services were rendered for informal, out-of pocket
expenditures (over 70 percent o f total expenditures in 2006). In 2006 Government launched a radical
reform o f the health care system, where the private sector would be the primary provider o f health
care services and where financing would come from a mixture o f public and private health insurance.
For health facilities, Government has introduced a program t o replace outmoded and derelict public
facilities with a smaller number o f modern private facilities. For, financing, the Government has
initiated a state financed Medical Insurance Program for the poor, and certain classes o f public
employees and about 900,000 people are expected to receive benefits in 2009. This scheme i s being
supplemented by a voluntary insurance scheme where the Government subsidizes private insurance
premiums for those enrolling in the system. The M I P accounts for over 50% o f the total health care
budget and likely represents a significant improvement in access to and affordability o f health care by
poor households because o f effective targeting. The Primary Health Care Project (renamed the Health
Project) was restructured in April 2009 to assist Government in implementing i t s revised reform
program. Overall during the CPS period, and despite the radical shift in policy orientation key health
outcomes have begun to improve, namely rates o f infant and maternal mortality appear to be on track
in achieving MDG targets. Also there has been some progress in reducing the incidence o f l o w birth
weights.

Health care reforms are beginning to have an impact after a slow start.

population) Since then funding
for TSA nearly doubled and those
receiving TSA increased to 13%

Additional Achievements

Targeting mechanism launched in
2006. In 2009 about 140,000
households with 400,000
beneficiaries receive the TSA.
Overall, about 40% o f the
Georgian population i s registered
in Social Service Data system
which i s used to target several
programs including the TSA and
the MIP.
Without pensions overall and
extreme poverty rates would
increase 40 and 95 percent
respectively. .

42.
The social security system i s better targeted and effective in alleviating poverty. The
targeted social assistance program (TSA) launched in 2006 with World Bank assistance along with
the existing pension system i s proving to be effective buffers against poverty. The impact i s even
more pronounced in the case o f extreme poverty: Without TSA, the extreme poverty rate would
increase by 17 percent, the extreme poverty gap by 50 percent and the severity o f poverty index
would double, indicating that TSA significantly decreases inequality among the extreme poor. The
impact on the extreme poverty gap and poverty severity i s particularly important as it reflects good
targeting performance. Pensions are also very effective in reducing poverty among the poor.

the state budget and numerous donors including the Bank, MCC, KFW and EBRD.
Rating of the Second Pillar: Satisfactory.

44.
Overall the CPSCR rates the outcomes under the second pillar as satisfactory. The
commitment to education reforms is beginning to show results and laying the groundwork for
sustained improvements in education outcomes in the years to come. After a slow start, and then an
abrupt shift in Government Health care strategy, the Government reforms in the health sector have
begun to gain traction. Overall services improved and critical health indicators have begun to show
improvements. Good progress in reforming the social assistance system and improvements in the
pension regime has served to expand coverage and better target assistance, and as a result many
thousands of Georgians have been kept from slipping into extreme poverty. Finalb, changes in the
organization and management of local Government units and steady improvements in the capacity of
municipalities and local government units to design deliver and maintain infrastructure and services
are having a positive impact. Overarching all these improvements were concerted efforts to eliminate
corruption in service provision. The uniform university entrance exam, consolidation of benej2
programs and the introduction of the targeted social assistance program and delegation of
management and accountability to local school directors were important steps in the war on
corruption.

Pillar 3. Improving Efficiency in Public Services

45.
A key Government priority was to improve public sector management. The Government was
focused on streamlining public services, eliminating those deemed to be unnecessary, privatizing
services where possible, and strengthening capacity and performance in those that were left. The CPS
focused on six areas including: (i) addressing corruption and governance in public service; (ii)
improving public expenditure management; (iii)improving Country Financial Management and
Procurement Systems; (iv) modernizing the judiciary; (v) Strengthening Inter-Governmental Fiscal
Relations; and (vi) Improving the Management of the Civil Service.

Instruments: PRSO series, PSFMI IP

46.
The new Government adopted an approach to corruption that relies more heavily on
actions and modeling acceptable behavior in each Government agency then on special
commissions or Government bodies to fight corruption. The new Government’s initial approach
to anti-corruption was action oriented and highly successful. Early reorganization o f the traffic
police, creation o f the standardized university entrance exam, reorganization o f customs and tax
departments, simplification o f licensing and permits, and aggressive prosecution o f corruption cases
removed opportunities for corruption and imposed s t i f f sanctions for those who engaged in corrupt
practices. The Government i s now paying more attention to institutionalizing anti-corruption
programs through the establishment o f the anti-corruption council chaired by the Minister o f Justice,
and recent efforts to engage c i v i l society more fully in public discussion o f Government programs i s a
promising sign that dialogue with civil society will receive greater attention going forward.

Public Expenditure management has improved markedly over the CPS period and remains a
key area o f focus for the Government. A medium term expenditure framework (MTEF) was
introduced which provides for budget planning on a four year rolling average. The annual budgeting
exercise i s launched by the publication o f the Government’s Basic Data and Directions (BDD) which

.

Instruments: Judicial Reform Project

Judicial reform was implemented at a slower pace than anticipated. While some
progress has been achieved in training and infrastructure, public perception o f the judicial system has
remained poor, due in part to some high profile rulings. The CPS had set rather robust outcome
targets for judicial reforms, and in hindsight they were perhaps too ambitious given that the Bank’s
only intervention in judicial reforms was a court modernization project, which was approved in the
previous CAS period and which closed shortly after the CPS was approved. The project did
rehabilitate critical court infrastructure, built and equipped the High School o f Justice, financed
judicial training and fostered a dialogue on Judicial Reform that was carried forward by other donors
who remained active in the field, namely USAID, UNDP and EC. While the project was deemed to
be moderately unsatisfactory by IEG for failing to improve public perceptions about the judiciary, it
was a precursor for continuing donor and Government support for judicial reform which may be
gaining momentum.

50.
Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations were improved significantly with the passage o f the
Law o f Local Self Government Budgets. The law, which defined fiscal relations between the center
and local government units, was instrumental in making such relationships more transparent and
predictable. An equalization formula i s used to determine the amount o f the transfers and the formula
i s being fine tuned as experience i s gathered. Along with the change in how LGU’s are financed, the
number o f such units was rationalized, creating a smaller and more manageable number o f such units.

PRSO. PSFMRSP

51.
The new Government chose not to pursue system wide civil service reform, instead
allowing individual ministries and public agencies considerable latitude to devise personnel
management systems best suited for their particular operations. As a result many agencies were
able to restructure, rejuvenate staffing, adjust salary structures and introduce training programs. This
approach was accompanied by a significant downsizing in Government agencies and the outsourcing
to the private sector o f some activities including power generation (completed) and medical services
(underway). Some restructurings, however, may have left agencies in weaker positions with fewer
experienced staff and less services, for example in the Ministry o f Agriculture which downsized
considerably.

52.
The CPSCR rates performance under pillar 3 as moderately satisfactory. Achievements in
improving public expenditure management and intergovernmental Jiscal relations were particularly
impressive as the Government moved quickly to improve the budget process, introduce multi-year
budget pameworks and initiate a shift to results oriented budgeting and public investment programs.
For local government units the law on local government budgets in 2006 made transfers to local
budgets more transparent and facilitated the move to consolidate the number of local government
units into a more manageable number. After a late start some progress has been made in improving

65

public procurement and preparing an action plan following the CPA. Financial management reforms
have been somewhat slower, but the recent adoption of a new law on the Chamber of Control
elevating it to the status of a supreme audit agency and requiring it to conduct audits on the basis of
international principals show promise for acceleration of reforms in this area. Outcomes in judicial
reforms were weaker, though the level of the Bank involvement in this area was limited. Nonetheless,
with support of other donors, judicial and legal reform may be gaining momentum raising
expectations that the outcomes hoped for in Judicial reform can still be achieved. The CPS
anticipated a more centralized approach to civil service reform then the Government eventually
adopted, nonetheless the Government is now in a better position to hire qualiJied workers and
individual agencies have the leeway to adopt personnel management systems best suited to their
circumstances.

111.

World Bank Performance

53.
Overall the Bank delivered the CPS program on time, and with high quality operations and
analytical work. The Bank fielded high quality teams, worked effectively with development partners
and forged a strong working relationship with the Government. The CPS employed a balanced mix
of development policy credits, investment operations, and analytical work to deliver an effective
program o f assistance to reform minded and action oriented Government.
Lending

54.
Implementation of ongoing projects and proactive supervision has contributed to
achievement o f project objectives in most instances. The portfolio of projects under
implementation during the CPS period decreased substantially following the decision o f the
Government and the Bank to focus assistance on a few key sectors. Most of the 12 projects that
excited the portfolio during the CPS period exited with satisfactory ratings in the ICRs and by IEG,
with particularly good performance by projects in transport and municipal development. O f the four
projects exiting with unsatisfactory rating, Judicial Reform exited at the beginning o f the CPS period
and suffered from the initial focus o f Government o f areas o f reform other then the judicial sector.
The other three projects, integrated coastal zone management (closed in FY06) and forestry
(cancelled in FY08) and Irrigation (closed in FY09) were all approved under the previous
Government. Despite the best efforts o f Bank staff, differences in opinions on the policy stance and
institutional arrangements in the rapidly evolving policy environment, were too wide to bridge and as
a result the projects did not wholly met their development objectives.. It i s interesting to note,
however, that after Forestry and Irrigation projects closed the Government’s policy views actually
evolved to a point closer to the Bank’s view. In both cases the Bank has found ways to stay engaged
with the Government as its policy stance continues to evolve. Overall, ratings for proactivity, and
realism for Georgia are at 100 percent. Disbursements have been high reaching over 52 percent in
FY08 and 77 percent in FY09. The fast delivery o f the series o f roads projects, which were “shovel
ready” when approved, was the main driving force behind the high disbursement rates.

55.
Delivery of new operations has been timely, and in line with the CPS. The number o f
operations and total amount committed during the CPS exceeded programmed amounts as the Bank
and Government were able to take advantage o f Georgia’s increased IDA allocation from the
performance based allocation system and i t s transition to LBRD to add projects for Avian Influenza,
and the East-West corridor, and to provide additional financing for the Secondary and Local Roads
project. Financing available for the Municipal Development Project (FY09) was also increased over
CPS estimates.
56.
The PRSO Series was particularly successful in advancing the policy dialogue and the
Government’s reform program. The improved resource picture available to Georgia during the
CPS period enabled the addition of a fourth PRSO operation in FY08 in addition to the three
66

operations anticipated in the PRSO, and a supplement to PRSO IV also in FY09 in response to the
events of August 2008. The PRSO operations focused on four priority reform areas for the
Government including: Public Sector Management; Energy; Social Sectors; and Private Sector
Development. These were all identified as key areas in the CPS matrix and the availability o f the
development policy series strengthened the policy dialogue and reform efforts. The PRSO series also
complemented and was complemented by investment lending. The Electricity market support project
helped to finance metering equipment which was critical to the reforms in the power sector, and the
health and education projects, along with AAA work on the social benefit helped achieve reform
objectives in the social sectors. Finally, the Public Sector Financial Management Reform Support
Project complements reforms in the first pillar of the PRSO.
Analytical and Advisory Services

57.
Analytical and Advisory Services were in line with the CPS and delivered substantial
results to the Client. Particularly important throughout the CPS period was PHRD Grant support for
the PRSO program and for the education reforms where the grants continue to support curriculum
development, teacher training, and testing and assessments. Other advisory support that has been
successful in supporting PRSO reforms are the Programmatic Public Expenditure work and the
Programmatic Poverty Assessment, which helped in the development o f the TSA. Complementing
the programmatic poverty work was a full scale poverty report in FY09 which reported on the basis o f
a L S M S survey of over 7000 households. For public sector management, the Bank in partnership
with the EU completed a Public Financial Management Assessment (PEFA) in FY08 which
systematically reported on over 50 areas of public management in x key areas, and which will provide
the basis for further reform efforts in PFM going forward. A Country Procurement Assessment was
also undertaken and an action plan agreed with the State Procurement Agency which i s now
overseeing i t s implementation. Finally, a Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) which i s looking
at factors affecting growth i s under preparation. These core activities were supplemented by sector
studies including: (i)the financial sector (The Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) jointly
undertaken by the Bank and the IMF; (ii)an Education Policy Note that led to Georgia’s inclusion
into the Education Fast Track Initiative (FTA; and (iii)an Accounting and Auditing ROSC. Finally,
the Bank supports Georgia’s Youth Voices Group which implemented a Bank grant in support of an
international youth conference on youth issues in conflict affected areas of ECA and a local
conference on IDP youth issues following the August 2008 events. Overall, the CAE concluded that
the Bank’s analytic and advisory activities were relevant, o f high quality and well connected with the
lending program and that the quality o f the policy dialogue was good.
Working with Government
The Bank has a close and productive working relationship with Government forged on
58.
the basis of mutual respect, solid and professional teams and largely congruent views on reform
priorities. The relationship was strengthened by the fact that there was continuity in key teams
working on macro-economic issues, public sector financing and social sectors that allowed for close
professional relationships to develop where focused, spirited and substantive policy dialogue could
take place in an atmosphere o f mutual respect. The relationship benefited as well by the Bank’s
ability to respond quickly in response to urgent situations, beginning with i t s response to the new
Government’s accession to power by quickly ramping up assistance and.helping to convene a donor’s
conference within six months of the new Government coming to power. The Bank’s ability to
provide just in time assistance during the floods at the beginning of the CPS period, later during the
Avian Influenza outbreak, and most importantly after the events of 2008 has also helped to solidify
the working relationship with Government. Finally, the role o f the country office with i t s cadre o f
experienced and skilled staff has contributed to a productive working relationship with Government.
The recent trend o f moving task management responsibilities to country office staff has improved the
Bank’s over responsiveness, particularly in day-to-day portfolio management issues.

67

59.
The decision early in the CPS period to begin integrating PrUs into the implementing
ministry’s structure has also contributed to better Government ownership o f Bank investment
operations and greater oversight by the Government o f project implementation. Responsibility for
project implementation now rests solely with the implementing ministries with consulting support as
needed only for those functions directly related to Bank requirements for procurement and financial
management. Not all changes in implementation were advantageous, however. For the irrigation
project the decision to move responsibility for irrigation works to the Municipal Development Fund
assured adequate supervision o f the civil works contracts, but it reduced the involvement o f Ministry
o f Agriculture in project management and weakened the focus on maintenance and sustainability
issues.
Working with Other Partners

60.
Donor support for Georgia following the Rose Revolution has been substantial,
sustained and reasonably well coordinated. The donor’s conference in June 2004, six months after
the new Government took power, pledged $1.1 billion in support for the period 2004 -2006. Actual
donor support exceeded this amount, totaling about $1.6 billion, as a result o f higher commitments by
the US through the MCC compact, by the EC through Georgia’s participation in the European
Neighborhood Program and from IDA due to Georgia’s strong performance. Bilateral assistance,
notably from Germany, Japan and the Netherlands also was higher then pledged.
61.
International support for Georgia was reaffirmed following the August 2008 crisis. A Joint
needs assessment co-managed by the Bank and the UN with participation o f other key donors
including the EC, IFC, EBRD and ADB and working closely with Government parties was completed
within weeks o f the end o f the conflict, enabling the Bank and EC to convene a donor’s conference in
October. The resulting pledges o f $4.5 billion exceeded expectations and a recent assessment shows
good progress in realizing donor pledges.
62.
The donors coordinate among themselves through a donor coordination framework group
which meets regularly to exchange information on individual programs. The framework group i s
supplemented by sector coordinating groups in a large number of sectors. These groups are usually
donor led though Government participation at the sector level i s routine. Since the JNA, the
Government has further strengthened i t s role in leading the donor coordination effort, with the
Minister of Finance responsible for chairing periodic donor meetings to review progress in
implementing programs identified in the JNA, and overseeing the operation of key sub-sector groups
dealing with transport, internally displaced persons (IDPs) and the financial sector.

63.
The Bank also coordinates with key donor partners on individual operations. Several projects
during the CPS had direct or parallel co-financing. The Public Sector Financial Management Reform
Support project (PSFMRSP) involves a unique pooled funding arrangement with funding from IDA,
DFLD, SIDA, the EC and the Netherlands. The PRSO program was co-financed by the Netherlands,
and the EC provided parallel financing in support o f complementary reforms. The education projects
have benefited from PHRD funding for critical technical assistance, and the Rural Development
project i s receiving similar PHRD funding as well as parallel financing from IFAD. Finally, LFC
advisory services have received critical support from Canada, British Petroleum and partners under
the Regional Development Program and the International School of Economics at Tbilisi State
University (ISET) was established with financial support from the Bank, British Petroleum, SIDA
and Norway.

68

Management of Risks

64.
The identification o f risks unfortunately proved to be prophetic, with regional conflict
and the external economic crisis combining as twin shocks to the economy affecting both
growth prospects and poverty levels in the last 10 months of the CPS period. The donor response
to the August crisis, the Government’s strong record o f macro-economic management, and the solid
base of reform provide a good basis for Georgia to withstand these shocks and return to a solid
growth stance once the international economic crisis eases, Two caveats are needed however.
Donors will need to work to fulfill their entire pledge amounts both in quantity and timing and if
possible increase assistance in support o f Georgia’s recovery efforts. Second, efforts are needed to
ease tensions between Government and some opposition parties, which if left to fester could keep
investor confidence from improving and stymie quick recovery.
Rating Bank Performance: Satisfactory

65.

The CASCR rates Bankperformance as satisfactory. Overall, the CPS was well-aligned with
Government priorities and represented a welcome narrowing of the Bank Group’s focus. The CPS
included an appropriate balance between the series of annual policy based credits and related
investment operations, and analytical work, particularly the programmatic poverty and economic
work which was key in supporting on-going reforms. Seasoned and professional teams supported by
a strong country office offered continuity and professionalism that cemented a close working
relationship with the Government. The CPS proved to be flexible in adapting to changing priorities,
sh@s in reform stance, and emerging crises. The assistance program was able to expand to
accommodate the extra resources that became available to Georgia because of its strong reform
performance, and the Bank was able to respond quickly both to the changing resource picture and the
challenges that arose during the CPSperiod. Of particular note was the quick response of the Bank
and development partners to the August 2008 events in working with the Government to produce a
comprehensivejoint needs assessment, and convene the Brussels Donor ’s conference that delivered
badly needed assistance at a time when Georgia was reelingfiom the effects of conflict and emerging
world economic crisis. The CPS was marked by innovation as well including the unique pooling
arrangement for the PSFMRSP, the service agreement with MCC, and restructuring of the health
project to accommodate the major shift in health care reform. There were some setbacks as well.
Several operations failed to have the expected development impact mostly due to policy diferences
between the Government and the Bank that were too wide to bridge. But even in the case of forestry
and irrigation constructive dialogue with the Government onhture policy directions has continued..

IV. Lessons and Recommendations
Selectivity - Prior to the CPS, the Bank had built a diverse portfolio of small projects in
66.
numerous sectors. In preparation for the CPS, Bank Management had grown concerned about the
fragmented portfolio and wanted to explore with Government options for making it more focused.
This view was shared in the CAE which noted the Bank’s “enthusiastic foray into many sectors at
once” in the period 1998 - 2003 that “stretched the scarce IDA envelope, weakening interventions in
important areas”. In early discussions it was quickly apparent that the new Government had the same
view. I t was agreed that new operations and analytical work would concentrate on a few sectors. As
a result as older project closed, the number o f operations and the sectors where the Banks was
involved were reduced considerably. The success in making Bank Group assistance more selective
was largely due to the Government being on exactly the same page about the importance of focus and
depth.
Balance among instruments -The balance between quick disbursing and investment lending
67.
worked very well. The PRSO series was used to elevate key policy/institutional decisions and the

69

investment operations assisted in defining the issues and implementing solutions. There i s a caveat
however. These complementarities were possible partly because the Bank had a diversified portfolio
for much of the CPS period and this meant the Bank had expertise and in-depth knowledge o f a
number o f sectoral issueshstitutions. Projecting forward, this could be more difficult if the Bank
reduces i t s activities to a more narrow set of areas.
68.
Implementation arrangements - Another area o f early convergence o f views between the
Bank and the new Government was the desire to move from projects led by autonomous project
implementation units to ones in which the beneficiary Government entity was very much in charge,
with only limited project specific staffing, mainly to handle fiduciary tasks. In Georgia this approach
works well, because the Government recognizes the importance of ownership and control o f the
implementationprocess and i s ready to take on this responsibility.
Programmatic support - The programmatic approach worked well, not only with the PRSO
69.
series, but also with the AAA program where the focus was on keeping it light in terms of big formal
reports, but making it replete with lots o f just-in-time technical advisory help on a wide range o f
issues.
Agility vs. Speed -The new Government set ambitious targets for itself both in the scope o f
70.
its reforms and the timeframe for their implementation. The Bank was successful in calibrating its
support to the Government’s ambitious timeframe in many instances while at other times insisting on
taking more time where it was essential for a successful outcome. The Bank moved very quickly with
a lot o f interventions, particularly the PRSO series, and the various roads projects, not to mention the
additional financing for irrigation to repair flood damage in 2005, and the accelerated processing of
the municipal development project in 2008 in response to the August conflict. At the same time, the
Bank, very selectively, insisted on more time when more groundwork was essential. Examples
include the privatization o f electricity distribution and the introduction o f the targeted social
assistance. Finally, at times views on policy directions were just too wide to bridge in the context o f
investment operations and the best approach was to disengage.

71.
Staffing -- Bringing in new staff to the team i s very important as it brings renewed vitality
and fresh perspectives to issues. But, continuity o f staff in key areas (country economist, sector
TTLs, IFC staff, and much o f the country office) provided the in-depth knowledge o f the country and
sector issues that was essential for the success o f the program. Finding the right balance between
rejuvenation and continuity will be a challenge going forward.
72.
Decentralizing project management to country office staff can facilitate problem solving
and speed implementation. Even where task management has stayed with headquarters staff,
enhanced roles for local staff in day to day administration has yielded positive results.
Partnerships with other donors leveraged our resources, led to more effective project
73.
interventions and made the policy dialogue more coherent and effective. Partnerships in Georgia
have been particularly innovative, including a service agreement between MCC and the Bank
whereby the Bank for a fee supervises MCC investments in infrastructure. Also a pooled funding
arrangement between four donors for the Public Sector Financial Management Reform Support
Project has resulted in a coordinated approach to reforms and simplified arrangements for
procurement and disbursement. Bank quick disbursing operations were cofinanced by one bilateral
donor, and were coordinated with other providers o f budget support and the PEFA exercise was
carried out jointly by the Bank and the EC. Finally, strong partnerships across the donor community
and with the Government were critical in the quick completion o f the Joint Needs Assessment
following the August 2008 crisis and for the timely convening o f the Donors conference in October
2008.

70

74.
Repeater Projects. Repeat operations or additional financing in roads and municipal
development over the years have built extensive implementation capacity in the respective
implementing agencies. It also eased project preparation and assured quick start up o f follow-on
investments as much o f the preparation was done under the preceding operation.

Annex 3: Consultations on the CPS

Consultations with the civil society representatives, including NGOs, academia, think-tanks,
private/banking sector representatives and the media were held in late May 2009. A series o f
presentations o f the proposed Country Partnership Strategy were made to various audiences in order
to gain feedback and comments.
OVERALL COMMENTS:

9 There was widespread agreement with the assessment o f the difficult economic situation in
Georgia, related to the August conflict, the global downturn and the tense domestic situation all
o f which had undermined investor confidence and growth. There was also support for the twopillar approach proposed by the Bank to address both the immediate vulnerability needs as well
as long term competitiveness.

9 There was strong appreciation for including governance as a cross-cutting theme in the
forthcoming strategy by a l l groups o f stakeholders. Georgia has made progress in reducing
corruption and liberalizing the economy and there i s a need for checks and balances and adequate
regulation. Other priorities relate to the increased communication and dialogue, sanctity o f
property rights, and the independence o f the judiciary.

9 The World Bank and other donors should carefully monitor their assistance to Georgia, and
condition this (for example on better transparency and disclosure, strong monitoring and
evaluation system in place). The World Bank approach i s particularly important, as one o f the
most reputable international organizations. World Bank fiduciary controls are helpful. The
World Bank should also strengthen its communications and dialogue outside the Government.
SECTOR-SPECIFIC COMMENTS:

9 Transport Infrastructure: Participants agreed on the priority of transportation for Georgia’s
development. However, such issues as monitoring the quality o f the roads and road safety need
to be carefully addressed. With regard to road safety, there are EU standards that could be applied
to Georgia as well.

9 Energy and Environment: There was wide agreement that the Government had made strong
gains in providing reliable energy supply. Promoting energy-efficiency programs i s o f utmost
importance to the country.
9 Rural Development: There was strong support for doing more in this area as exports and
agriculture production had not increased as fast as imports. 50% of labor i s in agriculture so it i s
an important sector. The need to increase the scale o f farms, to strengthen marketing, and
improve infrastructure including storage for vegetables were all mentioned.
9 Health/Social: Tremendous importance i s attributed to health management improvement. At the
same time, more professional training for staff and communication of benefits and modalities
with the public i s needed. While higher pensions did help reduce poverty, more targeted funding
through the TSA would be more efficient.

l+ Education: Education reform i s a top story in the country. In spite o f many innovations in basic
education, there were continuing needs including appropriate teaching manuals at secondary
schools, access to Internet, and improved quality o f teaching. Although Internet access has been
improving, now there i s a need to strengthen and improve the content. Higher education
management in Georgia requires further sustained improvements and quality upgrades.

74

>

Annual Poverty Assessment: Participants were surprised at the level of poverty noted in the
CPS - 23.7% which was different from that measured by the Statistics Agency. The Bank
shared the Poverty Assessment with participants who acknowledged it as a very useful report.

-

9 Private Sector: There was recognition that the Government had become much more business
friendly. Moreover, the global economy and the domestic political tensions were undermining
investor confidence. Government interference with businesses in the areas o f tax and judiciary,
and possible targeting o f certain businesses based on politics, were mentioned as a concern. A
concern was raised about monopolies in certain fields (like pharmaceuticals) and the need to
support small and medium enterprises. Some participants expressed concern that Private-Public
Partnerships (PPTs) could reduce public accountability.

9 Financial Management: There was strong support for the Bank continuing i t s efforts to
benchmark and report on progress in public financial management and procurement. There was
also a need to strengthen transparency in corporate accounting.

>

Trade and Investment: There was a concern that Georgia not become overly reliant on foreign
aid and investment, and that the Government needed to support local business growth with local
management. There was also a need to strengthen trade systems and information on Georgia to
facilitate trade and investment.

>

Construction sector: The situation was serious with a 40% o f labor force reduction (including
professional staff), and active sales coming to a halt. At the same, earlier investment was too
focused on purchasing assets rather than creating jobs and productivity. There was a clear need
for renovation (80% o f structures in need o f renovation)

>

Banking Sector: There were concerns on the level o f interest rates, now up to 20%. This can be
explained because banks have to pay high rates of about 12% on deposits. There was a need to
strengthen confidence in deposits and improve domestic capital markets. Other concerns included
i)lack o f credit; ii)lack o f liquidity; iii)fear of non-performingloans.
