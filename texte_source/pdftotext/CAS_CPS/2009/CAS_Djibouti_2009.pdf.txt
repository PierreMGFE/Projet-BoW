EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.
Djibouti is a small country of about 830,000 people, strategically located in
the Horn of Africa at the southern end of the Red Sea. The country i s almost a citystate-about two-thirds o f town dwellers live in the capital city. The hinterland, an
extension o f the deserts o f Ethiopia and Somalia, i s sparsely occupied by a poor pastoral
and nomadic population. Politically stable, the country plays a neutral role in the
frequently tense regional politics of the Horn of Africa.

..

Djibouti’s economy is based on rents deriving from its strategic location: port
revenues, military revenues, and foreign aid. Djibouti is poorly endowed with natural
resources, with limited arable land, rainfall, and water. The manufacturing sector is weak
and agriculture non-existent. A s a result, the economy i s based mainly o n revenues and
rents generated directly and indirectly from the activities o f the international Port o f
Djibouti and related businesses, including the trade traffic transiting to and from
landlocked Ethiopia, the main user o f Djibouti ports (with a population o f about 75
million people).
11.

...

For the last four years-the period of the last Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS)-Djibouti’s economic growth has been strong. Real GDP growth accelerated
from an annual average o f 3 percent in 2001-2005 t o 4.8 percent in 2006 and 5.9 percent
in 2008. This surge in growth was driven mainly by fiscal expansion and large foreign
direct investments (FDI) in the port, tourism, and construction sectors. Growth was
accompanied by increased inflation, however, which reached 14 percent in the 12-month
period to August 2008 as a result o f the global spike in energy and food prices.
111.

iv. However, Djibouti’s economic growth has not been sufficient to address the
country’s deep structural poverty and break the cycle of low social and economic
outcomes. Despite relatively high per capita income (US$ 1,060 in 2007), the incidence
o f poverty i s high in Djibouti (42 percent absolute and 75 percent relative). Poverty is
exacerbated by the presence o f a large number o f refugees living in Djibouti, who place
further pressure o n the country’s already strained social services. Despite some progress
in increasing school enrollment and reducing mortality, outcomes remain comparatively
low. A s a food-deficit country, totally dependent o n imports to meet i t s food
requirements, Djibouti i s highly sensitive to external shocks such as surging food and fuel
prices and natural phenomena such as floods and droughts. Finally, high
unemployment-estimated at 45-60 percent-contributes t o the fragility.
Djibouti is not immune to the impact of the globalfinancial and economic crisis.
Although the risk o f direct crisis contagion into the country’s embryonic financial sector
remains low, the global crisis may reach Djibouti mainly through the reduction o f foreign
direct investment. The impact o f this risk, currently considered limited, will depend o n
h o w deeply Djibouti’s major economic partners would be affected and o n Djibouti’s o w n
policy response.

v.

1

vi.
Djibouti’s new Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper-the
National
Initiative for Social Development (INDS)-provides
a comprehensive vision for
economic growth and poverty reduction. Presented to the World Bank’s Executive
accelerate growth while maintaining
Board on October 17, 2008, the strategy aims to: (i)
macroeconomic stability; (ii)achieve universal access to basic services and the
development o f human capital; (iii)
promote harmonious and balanced local development
that preserves the environment; and (iv) improve governance and capacity building.
vii.
The proposed CASfor FY2009-2012 has been prepared in consultation with
the Government and other stakeholders in an effort to increase harmonization and
complementarity. The objectives, themes, and programs included in the proposed CAS
were discussed with the Government, civil society, and other donors during formal
consultations betweenNovember 2008 and February 2009. The feedback provided during
these consultations has been incorporated into the strategy. The CAS places a strong
emphasis on working in concert with donors, focusing Bank programs on the Bank’s
comparative advantage, avoiding program duplication, and strengthening aid
harmonization. The CAS also represents an effort to strengthen coordination within the
World Bank Group, with contributions from the International Finance Corporation (IFC)
and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA).

...

The CAS is highly selective and builds on the achievements of the previous
CAS. As laid out in the CAS Completion Report (Annex 2), solid performance was
achieved under the previous CAS: portfolio management improved dramatically, and
every project i s expected to meet its development objectives. In the areas o f governance
and competitiveness, however-two areas where the Government had not yet made a
strong commitment to reform-not all outcomes were achieved. Based o n the Bank’s
previous experience in Djibouti, the limited IDA resource envelope, and the lessons
learned about development effectiveness in small states, the proposed CAS for FY20092012 targets a small number o f activities. The selection o f lending programs has focused
on areas where the Bank has a strong performance record. The Bank will also provide
capacity building assistance in other sectors where it has expertise.

viii.

The CAS is framed around three strategic themes aligned with the INDS.

ix.
0

Supporting growth. The Bank will support the Government’s efforts to
strengthen the business environment, with a focus on reducing constraints and
costs to private sector development, especially in the power,
telecommunications, and financial sectors.

0

Supporting human development and access to basic services. The Bank
will help Djibouti increase access to and quality o f education and health
services, and strengthen social protection and direct support to poor people.

0

Supporting governance and public sector management. The Bank will
continue to engage in policy dialogue and technical assistance to strengthen
the budget process and improve monitoring and evaluation.

..

11

The proposed assistance strategy recognizes that there are nonetheless risks
that could derail implementation of the CAS or limit its impact. Growth and sustained
macroeconomic stability depend o n the steady f l o w o f Government revenues from the
port and military bases and, more critically, o n the f l o w of FDI and donor financing.
While revenues from rented military bases are likely t o remain and may partially mitigate
the risk o f revenue loss, port revenues and FDI are vulnerable to external economic and
political shocks, including the persistence o f the current global financial crisis. Risks
related to implementation capacity also exist, but experience from the previous CAS
shows that well-focused projects with simple design and close and proactive supervision,
together with additional capacity building assistance, can significantly minimize this risk.

INTRODUCTION

1.
The last Country Assistance StrategV (CAS)for Djibouti was discussed by the
World Bank’s Executive Board in March 2005. The CAS for 2005-2008 supported
implementation o f the country’s first Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) with a
focus o n growth, human development, and governance.

2.
The CAS for FY2009-2012 is based on Djibouti’s National Initiative for
Social Development (Initiative Nationale pour le Dkveloppement Social - INDS). The
CAS will build o n the foundation laid in the previous strategy and support continued
implementation o f the INDS agenda. The three guiding principles for Bank engagement
over this time period include: (i)
alignment with the INDS; (ii)
selectivity for optimal
impact; and (iii)
complementarity and harmonization with other donors.
11.

COUNTRY CONTEXT

A.

Political and Social Context

3.
Djibouti is a small, resource-poor country of 23,200 square kilometers,
strategically located in the Horn of Africa at the southern end of the Red Sea. Djibouti
is poorly endowed with natural resources, lacking arable land, sufficient rainfall and
underground water, and o i l or natural gas resources. The national population i s estimated
at 830,000, o f which 87 percent live in urban areas.’ Djibouti i s essentially a city-stateabout two-thirds o f town dwellers live in the capital city. The hinterland, an extension o f
the deserts o f Ethiopia and Somalia, i s sparsely occupied by a poor pastoral and nomadic
population. Djibouti’s population is young, with about 40 percent under age 15 and only
15 percent over age 40.
4.
The country plays a neutral role in the frequently tense regionalpolitics of the
Horn of Africa. Djibouti has become Ethiopia’s sole link to the sea since fighting broke
out between Ethiopia and Eritrea in 1998. Djibouti had also maintained a cordial
relationship with Eritrea until a border dispute emerged in May-June 2008. The two
countries have not yet engaged in direct negotiations, but the situation is stable. Djibouti
plays an active role in hosting peace meetings between the parties to the violent conflict
in Somalia, and the country continues to accommodate a large number o f refugees from
neighboring countries, particularly from Somalia.
5.
Djibouti has strengthened relations and partnerships with other key nations.
In addition to Djibouti’s strong historical partnership with France, relations with the
United States have deepened following the increased U.S. military presence in the region
and the establishment o f a U.S. military base in the country. Similarly, a German naval
base was established in March 2002 to monitor sea traffic between Somalia and the

199 1. However, these figures are generally accepted. A new national census i s planned for 2009. See
paragraph 25.

Arabian Peninsula. Together, these partnerships have resulted in improved external
revenue flows in the form o f rent paid for use o f military bases.

6.

Arab countries, including the United Arab Emirates, have become important
economic allies. In 2000, Dubai Ports World obtained a 20-year management contract for
the Port o f Djibouti and later took over the administration o f customs and Djibouti
Airport operations. The result has been a significant increase in investment, efficiency,
activity, and revenues in Djibouti’s ports.

7.
Djibouti is internally at peace and secure. The power balance between the
country’s main ethnic groups remains a key determinant o f domestic political stability.
The two major components o f Djibouti’s population are the Issas and the Afars. The
former extend into neighboring Somalia, while the latter extend into Ethiopia and Eritrea.
Competition for power between the two groups led to a civil war from 1991 to 1994,
which formally ended through a peace agreement signed in 2001. In the past, close ethnic
ties to volatile and conflict-prone neighboring countries has sparked an inflow o f
refugees, increasing competition for already scarce resources and affecting internal
political stability. Under the current volatile regional circumstances, the country’s
leadership i s under pressure to avoid upsetting the precarious balance o f stability; this
situation diminishes the Government’s ability to make decisions on economic and social
reforms.
8.
Djibouti’s political system remains dominated by the presidential majority.
The President i s elected directly for a six-year term and appoints a prime minister. The
current President, in office since 1999, was re-elected in 2005 in a poll that was
boycotted by the opposition. The Parliament i s also elected. In the most recent
parliamentary election in February 2008, the ruling union pour la majorite‘ prbidentielle
(UMP) coalition won a landslide victory in local and regional elections and kept all 65
seats o f the national assembly. The election was boycotted by the opposition coalition,
the union pour l’alternance de‘mocratique (UAD). The judiciary branch i s
administratively subservient to the executive branch.

B.

Recent Economic Developments

9.
I n September 2008, Djibouti concluded an agreement with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF)for a new poverty reduction and growth facility (PRGF). Under
the agreement, Djibouti will receive US$ 20 million in financial assistance and will be
expected to implement a series o f social and economic reforms. The program aims to
foster sustainable and balanced economic growth through macroeconomic stability,
improved competitiveness, reduced inflation, and a strengthened external position.
Djibouti is essentially a rent-based economy, with rents deriving from its
10.
strategic location: port revenues, military revenues, and foreign aid. Agricultural

production and manufacturing represent only 5 and 16 percent o f GDP, respectively.
Services represent 79 percent o f GDP. Djibouti’s economy i s based principally on
revenues and rents generated directly and indirectly from the activities o f the
international Port o f Djibouti and related businesses. About 95 percent o f the transit

traffic t o and from Ethiopi ses the Port o f Djibouti, and t h i s constitutes 80 percent o f

generation container vessels. These new additions will enable the Port o f

12.
Inflation has accelerated in 2008, mainly due to rising global prices for
imported energy and food. The annual average inflation rate rose from 3.1 percent in
2005 to 5.0 percent in 2007, and is estimated at 12 percent in 2008. This increase is partly
a side effect o f increased consumption following rapid economic expansion, but it i s
primarily explained by the price surge o n international markets for food and energy.
Djibouti produces very little food and energy domestically and is fully dependent o n
imports, thus remaining structurally vulnerable t o external price shocks.
13.
Thefiscal deficit increased in 2006 and 2007, but has declined in 2008 despite
the food and energy crisis. Djibouti’s fiscal stance turned f r o m slightly restrictive in
3

2005 (0.2 percent o f GDP) to expansionary in 2006 (-2.5 percent o f GDP) and 2007 (-2.6
percent o f GDP) following increased spending related to the regional elections, the
November 2006 summit o f Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa
(COMESA) countries hosted in Djibouti, and rising electricity subsidies. These increased
expenditures were only partly offset by the country’s stable revenue performance (20.3
percent o f GDP in 2006 and 20.5 percent in 2007). The fiscal deficit i s estimated at 1.9
percent o f GDP in 2008. Fiscal revenues have decreased as a result o f the elimination o f
the consumption tax on basic food items (about 0.5 percent o f GDP), but increased
transfers to the public electricity company, Electricite‘ de Djibouti (EDD), were largely
compensated through donors’ assistance. Over the medium term, the fiscal deficit i s
assumed to remain stable because the Government intends to keep the public wage bill
constant in real terms while benefiting from increased revenues through the introduction
o f a value-added tax (VAT) in January 2009.

14.
The widening current account deficit reflects mainly a surge in imports
financed by FDI, but also the increase in food and oil prices. The external current
account shifted from a small deficit in 2005 to a deficit o f 25.6 percent in 2007 and o f an
estimated 40.4 percent in 2008. This increase has been offset, however, by the large
capital and financial account surplus, which has led gross official reserves to grow to
US$ 130 million at the end o f 2007 and U S $ 174 million at the end o f 2008. As a result,
by the end o f 2008, international reserves covered the equivalent o f about 3.3 months o f
imports.

15.
External debt remains high. External debt increased from US$ 437 million in
2006 to U S $ 504 million in 2007 and US$ 614 million in 2008. Some 90 percent o f
Djibouti’s debt i s concessional and long term. The debt-to-GDP ratio has grown from 57
4

percent in 2006 to 59 percent in 2007 and 62.3 percent in 2008. Measured as a share o f
GDP, debt service remains stable at 3.3 percent in 2006 and 2007 and 2.9 percent in
2008. Following the PRGF agreement between Djibouti and the IMF, the Government
and Paris Club creditors agreed in October 2008 to a restructuring o f external debt. The
agreement, concluded under the Evian approach, was based on Houston terms. It
included exceptional additional measures in view o f Djibouti’s limited capacity o f
payment, and covered U S $ 69 million, including U S $ 58 million in arrears and late
interest. It is expected to reduce debt service to Paris Club creditors from U S $ 85 million
to US$ 19 million during the IMF-supported program. The Government committed to
seek comparable treatment from its non-Paris Club creditors. Paris Club creditors agreed
in principle to consider an exit debt treatment if necessary to restore debt sustainability at
the end o f the current agreement’s consolidation period in 2012, provided that Djibouti
concludes a follow-up program with the IMF, implements comparable treatment with its
other external creditors, and makes all payments under the current agreement o n time.
16.
Monetary conditions continued to ease in 2006 and 2007, but the situation
changed slightly in 2008. The money supply (M3) expanded by 17.2 percent in 2008.
Credit to the private sector increased by 23 percent in 2007 after remaining stagnant for
several years, owing mainly to consumption, construction, a public investment boom and
the entry o f new banks. The Djiboutian franc depreciated against the Euro in 2006 and
2007. This should have improved the competitiveness o f Djibouti’s merchandise exports,
but structural weaknesses such as limited natural resources, high electricity and labor
costs, l o w skills, limited labor productivity, and a weak institutional environment
continue to constrain the development o f export sectors beyond port and transportation
services activities.
The banking sector has been expanding rapidly. The banking sector i s well
17.
capitalized and profitable, and banks have progressively reduced their portfolio o f
nonperfonning loans. Four new banks launched operations in 2006-2008, raising the
number o f banks in Djibouti to six. Four additional banks are expected to enter the
market by the end o f 2009. The banking sector has undergone substantial structural
changes in the past five years, including the closure o f ailing banks. The establishment o f
new banks is expected to foster competition by reducing borrowing costs and widening
the number o f financial instruments availqble to small and medium enterprises (SMEs). A
recently launched Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) is addressing the
growing challenges o f banking supervision.

18.
Djibouti’s trade system is fully open, with no protective tariffs or non-tariff
barriers. Because capital movement is free and banking i s liberal, the country has
become a regional center for trade services, taking advantage o f the Port o f Djibouti’s
natural strategic location and increased geopolitical importance.

C.

Economic Outlook over the CAS Period

19.
The risks of direct crisis contagion into the financial sector remain low, due to
the relatively underdeveloped financial system and the largely cash-based economy.
The stock market is non-existent, and financial intermediation i s based mainly on
banking. Though the banking sector has been expanding rapidly, there are s t i l l only six
banks in Djibouti, and most o f them originate from developing or emerging countries.
Nonetheless, the two largest incumbent banks are owned by large French banking groups
and account for more than 90 percent o f all deposits and credit extensions. These banks
operate largely independently and are well capitalized, reasonably liquid, and profitable.
A substantial crisis would arise if both banking systems were affected in parallel by a
liquidity shock and the French banks were not sufficiently supported by the state.
20.
The impact of the global crisis on the real economy andpoverty reduction will
depend on how deeply Djibouti's major economic partners are affected and on
Djibouti's own poZicy response. The major risk in the medium term arises from lower
FDI flows. FDI has been high at about 31.3 percent in GDP in 2008, but it i s expected to
drop to 8.1 percent o f GDP in 2009 due to the likely postponement o f a large new
investment project (construction o f second container terminal in Doraleh). Although it is
reassuring that many o f the planned investment projects for 2009 and 2010 have been reconfirmed, a few, including the construction o f an o i l refinery and a pipeline, are at risk
o f being cancelled due to the impact o f the global crisis in home countries o f investors.
The authorities are currently assessing the potential impact o f the crisis, in close
coordination with the IMF and the World Bank. The impact o f the global crisis on
Djibouti's economy i s projected to slow down FDI (Box 2), and hence reduce the growth
o f the economy by 1-1.5 percentage points annually in the medium term. Should the
global situation worsen, the authorities would likely have limited leverage to mitigate
such a development and would rely on a tightening o f the fiscal position in response to a
decrease in revenues. Changes in inflation and in the exchange rate would have to be
closely monitored as external pressures may be conflicting (e.g., movements in
commodity prices, adjustments in the U S $ exchange rate, slow down o f capital inflows
and imports). External assistance, in terms o f both technical assistance and financial
support, would be needed to help mitigate the poverty impact o f such a shock.
21.
Medium-term growth prospects will be driven by investment project trends
and the expected growth of port activities. Economic growth is projected to slow down
moderately to about 5 percent in 2009, mainly due to the postponement o f construction o f
the second container terminal in Doraleh. Over the CAS period, growth i s forecasted to
rebound to rates o f about 7 percent with the expected increase in port and transshipment
activities if investments remain stable. In a more conservative scenario, the economy i s
projected to grow at a rate o f 5.5 percent annually in the medium term. Annual average
inflation, estimated at 12 percent in 2008, is expected to fall under 7.5 percent in 2009 as
world o i l and food prices drop from their 2008 highs. Traditional exports are forecasted
to continue rising in 2009-2010, following the recent expansion o f port activities and
cattle processing facilities, while the trade deficit is expected to diminish in 2009 as a
result o f reduced international food and oil prices and a fall in FDI-related imports after

the completion o f large projects in 2008. The gradual pick-up in FDI will likely result in
a renewed widening o f current account deficits beginning in 2010.

22.

Expenditures on social and poverty reduction programs are likely to increase
with the implementation of the INDS, but the fiscal position is projected to improve
gradually after 2009. The fiscal deficit will increase in 2009 due to lower grants, higher
investments, and military expenditure related t o the border conflict with Eritrea.
However, tax reforms and improvements in tax administration, including the introduction
o f the VAT and the rationalization o f exemptions in the Free Trade Zone in 2009, are
expected to increase tax revenue over the medium term. The outlook for increased
revenues generated by the dividends from port activities is optimistic. Increased social
spending would be offset mostly by a fall in other current expenditures, allowing for
gradual fiscal consolidation over the CAS period.

7

23.
Debt sustainability is expected to improve in the medium term, but remains
high. A Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) conducted in September 2008 indicates that
the net present value (NPV) o f total public and publicly guaranteed external debt (50
percent o f GDP in 2007) i s projected to remain above the sustainability threshold until
2016, reflecting short-term vulnerability. The N P V o f the debt-to-export ratio i s projected
to cross the 100 percent threshold in 2009, and to improve considerably as a result o f the
expected opening o f an o i l refinery in 201 1. However, the DSA indicates that the debt
service-to-exports ratio remains below the sustainability threshold o f 15 percent, even
when exports o f refined products are excluded from the denominator. The Paris Club debt
rescheduling negotiated in October 2008 has not changed substantially the debt
sustainability situation, as i t s objective was mainly to address immediate liquidity
problems and regularize Djibouti’s situation vis-a-vis external creditors, rather than to
reduce the stock o f debt.

The largest risk to maintaining macroeconomic stability is associated with an
increase in debt and a simultaneous slowdown in economic growth. At the time o f CAS
preparation, the prospects for achieving the growth objectives set forth in the IMFsupported structural adjustment program appear realistic, despite the challenges o f the
global crisis and the continuation o f the border conflict with Eritrea. However, if the
global crisis were to deepen over the CAS period and FDI, aid, and trade flows were
more severely affected than projected, more external financing would be required to meet
the country’s financing needs. The decline in economic growth coupled with an increase
in debt would then pose a substantial risk to macroeconomic sustainability, especially if
the costs o f new borrowing were to increase.

Djibouti suffers from a very weak statistical base. The last census was carried
out in 1983, and all population statistics are based on a demographic survey from 1991.
This poses serious problems for the accuracy o f almost all statistics in Djibouti, including
information on population size, living standards, and the nature and incidence o f poverty
in the country. However, these sources are broadly accepted by all users in advance o f the
results from the new population census, launched in March 2009, and the more detailed
household surveys that would follow.

Some progress has been made in improving living standards in recent years,
and Djibouti is on track to achieve some key Millennium Development Goals (MDGs):
MDG2 on universal primary school enrollment, MDG3 on gender equality, and MDG4
on child mortality. A World Bank assessment o f the 2004-2006 PRSP noted a few
advancements in living standards. Although dropout and repetition rates remain high, net
primary school enrollment has grown significantly to 66.2 percent, up from 34.7 percent
in 2002. The elimination o f gender inequality in school enrollment i s on track, with a
Gender Parity Index (ratio o f girls to boys) o f 0.70 at the primary level and increased
female literacy. Infant and child mortality rates have improved, and malnutrition (as
measured by the proportion o f underweight children under the age o f five) has fallen to
26 percent. Access to potable water has increased to 96 percent o f the population in

9

Djibouti-Ville; water access in rural areas has improved, but still remains low at 52.5
percent.
27.

Overall, however, social and human development indicators are still
unsatisfying and depict a picture of fragility among the poor. Djibouti ranks 149th out o f
177 countries in terms o f human development, placing the country at the bottom o f the
“medium human development” category using data from 2005 .2 Djibouti’s overall
Human Development Index (HDI) score o f 0.516 i s slightly higher than the average for
Sub-Saharan Africa as a whole (0.493), but lower than the average HDI for low-income
countries (0.570). L i f e expectancy at birth is estimated at 54 years.

28.
Poverty is severe and pervasive. With a per capita income o f U S $ 1,060,
Djibouti i s classified as a lower middle-income country, and i s ranked 52nd among 103
developing countries on the 2005 Human Poverty Index (HPI-1) with a score o f 30.3 Still,
the country has very high levels o f poverty (42 percent absolute and 75 percent r e l a t i ~ e ) ~
and some o f the poorest social indicators in the world. Although poverty i s more severe
in rural areas, 52 percent o f the poor and 72 percent o f the extremely poor live in
Djibouti-Ville, where two-thirds o f the population resides. Poverty in Djibouti i s
exacerbated by the presence o f a high number o f refugees, who place additional pressure
on the country’s social services.
29.

Unemployment remains high. Accurate employment figures for Djibouti do not
exist, but it i s estimated that 45 to 60 percent o f the labor force i s unemployed, with 58
percent o f the unemployed below the age o f thirty. Unemployment i s notably widespread
among women, regardless o f their socio-economic background. In 2007, unemployment
rates were estimated at 34 percent among married men and 60 percent among married

women.
30.
Djibouti is a food-deficit country, completely dependent on imports to meet its
food requirements. The food security situation is especially critical in livestockdependent areas, where the scarcity o f water and pasture land reduces the contribution o f
animal-derived products to household food and income. Annual rainfall i s l o w and
erratic, averaging just 200mm in good years. The persistent drought conditions, combined
with frequent successive seasons o f failed rains, stretch the traditional coping
mechanisms o f many pastoralists to the limit.
31.
Djibouti is also vulnerable to the following natural phenomena: (i)
periodic
floods with a recurrence period o f 10 years; (ii)
earthquakes, which usually fall between 2
and 4 on the Richter scale but could have important effects in urbanized areas, where

inferior construction materials such as cardboard, plastic, and leaves. In addition, climate
change i s expected to have a strong negative impact o n the country’s meager natural
resources, notably through: (i)
an increase in the sea level, which coupled with the rain
deficit, will cause a greater intrusion o f the sea in coastal areas; and (ii)
an increase in the
temperature at the surface o f the sea, which will have adverse effects o n sea life and
cause the disappearance o f mangroves, likely increasing floods and erosion.

GOVERNMENT OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY

A.

The National Initiative for Social Development

32.
Launched in January 2007, the INDS provides a comprehensive vision for
economic growth and poverty reduction in Djibouti. The strategy was completed in
January 2008 and replaces the former PRSP process (Box 3). Among its key targets are:
(i)
an economic growth rate o f about 7 percent annually; (ii)
a reduction in poverty to 28
an increase o f the gross school enrollment ratio t o 83 percent at the
percent’ by 2012; (iii)
primary level and 61 percent at the secondary level, accompanied by a reduction in
gender and geographical disparities; and (iv) a reduction o f the infant mortality rate to 60
per 1,000 live births, and in the maternal mortality rate to 400 per 100,000 live births.
The new strategy rests on four main pillars.

33.

Thefirstpillar o f the INDS aims to ensure macroeconomic stability and create
conditions for strong and sustainable economic growth through: (i)
increasing public
investment in social sectors and sectors that generate growth, while maintaining a prudent
fiscal deficit and overall macroeconomic stability; (ii)
strengthening the financial sector;
(iii)
improving the legal and business environment to attract private investment; (iv)
reducing production costs, notably in energy, water, and communications; (v)
diversifying the sources o f growth; (vi) improving the labor environment; and (vii)
promoting Djibouti as a competitive economic and services hub, taking advantage o f its
geo-strategic location and l i n k s recently established with key investors in the region.
34.
The secondpillar o f the INDS seeks t o develop human resources and improve
access to basic services, notably for women and youth. In particular, the objectives are:
(i)
improving access to education, while increasing the quality o f education services,
reducing gender and geographic disparities in the sector, and improving the management
o f the sector; (ii)improving the coverage and quality o f health care; (iii)reducing
unemployment through the development o f labor intensive activities, micro-finance and
other funding mechanisms, promotion o f small and medium enterprises, and j o b training
and placement; and (iv) expanding access to other essential services such as water,
energy, and communications.
35.
The thirdpillar o f the INDS, in complement to the first two pillars, reflects the
Government’s intent to promote the harmonious development o f rural and urban areas by:
This target seems very ambitious. The PRSP JSAN (September 2008) advised that indicators related to
the MDGs be updated once the population census and the other planned surveys are carried out.

11

(i)supporting investments in infrastructure (especially roads, housing, and sanitation),
lands improvement, and storage facilities; and (ii)improving agriculture and livestock
productivity while preserving the environment.

36.
The fourth pillar o f the INDS seeks t o improve governance and strengthen
public sector management by: (i)increasing public service efficiency; (ii)
improving
devolving more authority to decentralized levels
transparency in the budget process; (iii)
o f Government; and (iv) defining and implementing a sound monitoring and evaluation
system to track progress toward INDS objectives.
B.

Selected Key Development Challenges

Sustaining growth and improving competitiveness

37.

Diversifying the economy remains a critical challenge. The country wants t o
diversify the sources o f growth t o reduce i t s heavy dependence o n the services sector,
centered on the ports. The creation o f new economic activities would generate additional
fiscal revenues and sustain the country’s growth prospects. The areas that offer the most
promising opportunities for diversification include livestock, fisheries, tourism, and

12

mining. Yet the potential for diversification appears limited in the medium term. A
livestock export facility with a capacity o f 80,000 animals per month has been set up to
inspect, test, and quarantine animals t o ensure that they do not carry diseases harmful to
the economies and people o f importing countries. However, periodic droughts have a
negative impact on livestock production. Fish production i s estimated at 1,000 metric
tons per year with potential for about 48,000 metric tons, but the distribution network i s
not operational. Tourist attractions include several sandy beaches, rare fauna and flora,
and numerous islands, as well as the geographical nature o f the countryside, which
features ravines, plains, active volcanoes, and lakes, including salt lakes such as Lake
Assal. There i s also the potential to develop sea tourism, namely scuba diving and fish
watching. Investment in the tourist sector i s still limited, however. In mining,
opportunities exist mainly in salt production, with huge reserves in Lake Assal.
38.
I n order to attract more investment to Djibouti, the cost of doing business
needs to be reduced significantly, especially outside the offshore centers. Djibouti’s
business environment is characterized by a dichotomy between the conducive investment
environment o f the Free Zone and port zones o n one hand, and the heavy regulation o f
the domestic economy o n the other hand. For example, the single window administration
in the Free Zone provides fast, effective, and inexpensive services, allowing a new
business to be created in a short time frame (between 3 hours and 3 days). The situation
changes dramatically outside the Free Zone, where it takes approximately 37 days to
open a business. Formal consultations with the business community have indicated that
the cost o f doing business in Djibouti is high, and that f i r m s (and thus private sector
development) are particularly vulnerable t o the quality, supply, and cost o f infrastructure
services (especially electricity, water, telecommunications, and transport).

39.
Electricity access remains limited, tarvfs are high, and the power sector
operates under a heavy financial burden. Djibouti’s electrification rate remains low,
with only 57 percent o f urban areas connected t o the grid. In a recent survey o f SMEs
commissioned by the World BankY6the lack o f a reliable, secure, and low-cost energy
supply was cited by more than h a l f o f interviewees as the single most severe constraint to
doing business in Djibouti. Real generation capacity i s limited (1 19 M W installed, but
only an average o f 57 M W was effectively operational in 2008), and relies primarily o n
an ageing plant running o n expensive imported fuel oil. A s population growth and
urbanization give rise to increasing demand for electricity, available capacity i s
increasingly insufficient at peak periods. This situation leads to repeated power outages
and leaves very little reserve for generation equipment maintenance or other unexpected
accidents. In addition, electricity tariffs (averaging U S $ 0.32 per KWh) are high due to
persistently elevated o i l prices and various technical and non-technical inefficiencies o f
the electric utility, EDD. Despite high tariff levels, the EDD i s in a fragile financial
situation and has had to rely on government budgetary support in recent years.7

’The EDD’s net loss for 2008 i s estimated at US$4 million, despite close to U S $ 3 0 million in government
subsidies.

13

40.
Over the medium to long term, the Government plans to strengthen the
availability of electricity by linking up with the considerable and more affordable
hydropower resources available in Ethiopia. This link would take place through an
electric interconnection transmission line funded by the African Development Bank
(AfDB), which i s expected to be completed by mid-2010. At the same time, the
Government o f Djibouti would seek to maintain some degree o f energy independence by
replacing and expanding i t s traditional thermal generation capacity, and by developing
alternative sources o f energy. Plans include the exploration and development o f
Djibouti’s own geothermal resources, in partnership with foreign investors.
The telecommunications sector is also characterized by limited access and
41.
high costs. Djibouti Telecom, the public telecommunications company, is the sole service
provider in the country. The company i s vertically integrated and provides landline,
mobile (GSM), and Internet services to the entire country under a monopoly business
model. Owing to the absence o f an effective and independent telecommunications
regulator, the incumbent also undertakes regulatory functions. Tariffs are the highest in
the region, and cheap alternative services such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) are
blocked by the incumbent at i t s point o f access t o the external world. Installation o f
satellite-based technology (VSAT) i s also not allowed, as a “protectionist” strategy for
the incumbent. I11 management o f frequency spectrum and numbering leads to further
inefficiencies and poor quality o f service.

42.
Road maintenance funding is inadequate, and the century-old railway to
Ethiopia needs to be upgraded. The established road network i s sufficient t o meet
Djibouti’s needs, but quality suffers due t o poor sector organization and insufficient
funding o f road maintenance. The infrastructure and equipment o f the Djibouti-Ethiopia
railway are in poor technical condition, and the Chemin de Fer Djibouti-Ethiopie (CDE)
is de facto financially bankrupt. The railway only covers a 5 percent share o f the transit
traffic to Ethiopia, although it would make economic sense for both Djibouti and Ethiopia
if it were to play a much larger role. In spite o f the Government’s efforts, however,
attempts t o concession the railway t o a private operator have been unsuccessful to date.
43.
Enhancing competitiveness also re uires regulatory improvements to support
the business climate. Djibouti is ranked 153‘ out o f 181 countries o n the ease o f doing
business according to Doing Business 2009.’ The areas cited in the survey as needing the
procedures for starting a business, especially outside the
most improvement include: (i)
Free Zone; (ii)
getting a bank credit; and (iii)
protecting investors. The I N D S recognizes
that if the legal and regulatory framework for business i s to improve, action must be
taken, in particular, to: (i)
adopt a new commercial code; (ii)
create an arbitration center;
and (iii)
simplify business start-up procedures. A new code o f commerce i s expected to
be adopted in early 2009, and the Government i s committed t o increasing access to
financing, including through micro-credit, t o support private sector development.

Improving human development and safety nets

44.

Unemployment needs to be reduced. Unemployment in Djibouti results from a
combination o f factors: (i)
limited employment opportunities due to an absence o f laborintensive economic sectors; (ii)
weak labor productivity due to l o w skill levels and long
l o w levels o f education; and (iv) l i t t l e
hours spent consuming qat (see paragraph 49); (iii)
potential for self-employment, mainly due to limited access to finance for micro and
small enterprises. To address the issue o f unemployment, the Government has created a
Free Zone to attract labor-intensive investment and launched a campaign t o raise
awareness about the negative impact o f qat consumption. The Government i s also
determined to improve vocational training; a new employment promotion agency
(ANEFIP) i s n o w fully operational and responsible for technical training, especially for
young people.

45.
The poor are vulnerable and not sufficiently protected against the impact of
systemic crises and other shocks. As indicated above, droughts, floods and other natural
phenomena occur periodically in Djibouti. In 2006, the Government established the
Executive Secretariat for Risk and Disaster Management (Secre‘tariat Exe‘cutif de la
Gestion des Risques et Catastrophes - SEGRC). The SEGRC i s tasked with coordinating
the preparation o f plans for risk and disaster management, providing technical advice,
and coordinating the actions o f prevention, mitigation, and response. The Secretariat i s
operational, but its effectiveness i s constrained by limited resources. Apart from the
SEGRC, there are few government-run social assistance programs in place to protect
poor people against the impact o f systemic crises such as drought and price shocks, or
idiosyncratic shocks like illness and employment loss. Most government assistance
programs, especially food and nutrition-related assistance, are targeted t o the extreme
poor in rural areas. The majority o f poor people who live in urban areas do not receive
any direct public assistance, either in the form o f cash or other means, except for access
to micro- redi it.^ The Government has been experimenting with food for work schemes in
urban areas, but the coverage o f these programs is very narrow. Providing social
assistance to the urban poor poses several challenges, including designing effective
targeting systems.

46.
Investment in the water sector is needed to increase supply and develop smallscale agriculture in rural areas. Only 50 percent o f the population o f Djibouti-Ville is
connected to the public water supply; the other h a l f o f the capital’s population draws
water from connected neighbors or from public standpipes. It is estimated that more than
70 percent o f the rural population and their herds do not have access t o water within a
reasonable distance. The only available water sources in Djibouti are underground wells
and wadi runoff, which are both adversely affected by the arid climate. In addition, water
quality is deteriorating. Most o f the wells are old and close to exhaustion, and are
9

There i s however a small-scale, successful experience with cash transfers in Djibouti-Ville. The religious
NGO “Diwan-i-Zakat” collects donations, especially during the Ramadan, and distributes cash t o a limited
group o f beneficiaries, consisting o f orphans (fatherless children) and the handicapped. Orphans receive
money o n a regular basis if they provide their school grade records t o the organization. The identification
o f beneficiaries i s done with the help o f neighborhood committees, while all check-based transfers t o the
orphans’ guardians are meticulously documented.

15

affected by the saltwater wedge flowing from the sea. Moreover, Djibouti’s public water
supply systems suffer from inefficient organization and a flawed institutional
environment. T o overcome these challenges, the Government i s determined to explore
ways o f improving the efficiency o f the water utility, the Office Nationale de l ’Eau et de
I’Assainissement de Djibouti (ONEAD), and t o mobilize resources to invest in the
rehabilitation o f water wells and the construction o f dams o n the wadis that f l o w from
Ethiopia, in order to retain water for seasonal agriculture and livestock production and
help recharge the aquifer.
47.
The quality of education is low, and the education system does not provide
graduates with adequate skills to successfully enter the labor market. Despite some
progress in recent years, the education sector is grappling with the following issues: (i)
wide disparities in the quality o f education and learning outcomes between children in
urban and rural areas; (ii)
l o w school completion due to a combination o f high dropout
rates in the second year o f primary school and high repetition rates in Grade 5; (iii)
weak
expenditure management and inability t o plan for both expansion and quality
improvements at the primary and post-primary levels; and (iv) l o w relevance o f education
in preparing students for the labor market, with the consequence that recent large projects
(including port expansion and hotel development) have not generated many jobs for
Djiboutians.
48.
Health services delivery and health systems need further strengthening to
build on recent progress. Despite the significant decline in infant and child mortality
rates in the last few years, these rates are still high. Other significant health challenges
include: (i)h g h maternal mortality; (ii)high and rising incidence o f communicable
diseases, among them tuberculosis (588, cases per 100,000 persons), malaria, and
HIV/AIDS; (iii)
significant geographic inequalities in health indicators; (iv) weak health
systems and management capacity due to the scarcity o f qualified personnel and periodic
shortages o f medicines and medical supplies in health facilities; and (v) l o w and
inefficient public health spending, especially for adequate maintenance o f health
facilities.

49.

Considerable time and resources are devoted to chewing qat. This
amphetamine-based stimulant i s imported from Ethiopia, Yemen, and Somalia, and is
considered an important economic resource because i t generates about 16 percent o f tax
revenue, as well as employment in retail trade. Most adult males in Djibouti chew qat at
all-male social gatherings for up to 3-5 hours a day, taking time away from work and
family life. The practice diverts the limited incomes o f poor people from spending o n
basic needs and adversely affects labor productivity and livelihood opportunities. While
precise figures are not available, it is estimated that 50 percent o f households in Djibouti
use qat,” and that qat absorbs up t o 20 percent o f family budgets. The Government’s
campaign t o raise awareness about the negative consequences o f qat consumption has
received much press attention and triggered public debate, in particular as it equates the

Afiican Economies 17 (5): 661-687.

16

health and economic risks o f qat consumption with those o f tobacco and alcohol in a
predominantly Muslim country.
50.
The wide gender gap and female genital mutilation (FGM) are still major
social developmental challenges. The disadvantaged status o f women in Djibouti i s
reflected in gender gap indicators in social areas: lower literacy rates, lower school
enrollment and completion rates, and high female mortality attributed to high fertility and
anemia caused by malnutrition. Women’s vulnerability i s exacerbated by the widespread
practice o f FGM, which-though illegal since 1995-continues to affect more than 93
percent o f women.’’ The practice mostly affects girls between the ages o f 8 and 9, and is
administered mainly by grandmothers and mothers. According t o a recent survey,
however, 50 percent o f men are against this practice. Still, eradicating FGM remains a
challenge, as the practice i s deeply rooted in cultural tradition.
Strengthening governance

5 1.
Institutional capacity is weak, but the Government is committed to making
improvements. Despite Djibouti’s fairly elevated per-capita income, institutional capacity
i s constrained by insufficient skills and management capacity in the public
administration, as well as by the fragmentation o f decision-making processes. However,
the authorities appear committed t o making continued improvements in governance. The
President o f the Republic indicated recently that improving governance i s one o f the
highest government priorities, and has requested the Bank’s assistance in conducting a
governance and anti-corruption survey.
52.
Public finance management and economic governance have improved
recently, but risks remain. A 2004 Country Financial Accountability Assessment
(CFAA) identified serious weaknesses in budget preparation and execution, as well as in
internal control. To mitigate this risk, an action plan was developed consisting of: (i)
upgrading the primary budget function (revenues and expenditures); (ii)reforming
conducting a study o n
internal control procedures and upgrading internal audit; and (iii)
h o w to better coordinate the three main audit bodies.12 Implementation o f the action plan
has provided the system with the basic tools and procedures o f budget management. The
Budget Directorate n o w has better capacity (human and technical) to formulate, prepare,
and execute the budget in more realistic conditions, but more work i s needed to
implement results-oriented budgeting within a multi-year perspective. In addition, little
progress has been achieved in reforming the internal controls and granting more
autonomy to line ministries. Priorities for reinforcing and improving critical aspects o f
public finance include: (i)further integrating investment and expenditure budgets by
developing a Medium-term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) to guide resource allocation
and link sector budgets to programmatic outcomes; (ii)
reinforcing financial controls,
strengthening tax
including more timely and higher quality reporting and audits; (iii)
administration through improved information management; and (iv) developing adequate
procurement legislation.

Adequate policy planning and implementation rely on improving data
availability and enhancing statistical capacity. As stated above, the last census was
conducted in 1983, and data accuracy i s a major issue. According to the IMF, weaknesses
are particularly acute in the areas o f national accounts, trade, external debt, and some
fiscal data. There i s an indication that awareness o f the importance o f statistics among
government officials i s increasing. In 2006, Djibouti received a grant from the Trust Fund
for Statistical Capacity Building (TFSCB) to support improved compilation o f national
accounts and assist in the preparation o f the population census. However, addressing the
deficiencies in the statistical system will require a more comprehensive approach.

WORLD BANK EXPERIENCE UNDER THE PREVIOUS CAS
A.

Progress toward CAS Outcomes for 2005-2008

54.
With an envelope of SDR 14.6 million (about US$22 million), the 2005-2008
CAS was aligned to the 2002 PRSP. It focused on three PRSP pillars: (i)
growth and
competitiveness; (ii)human resources development; and (iii)good governance.
Following i s a brief review o f progress achieved in these areas over the previous CAS
period. A more detailed evaluation o f progress is included in the CAS Completion Report
(CAS CR) in Annex 2.
Outcomes in the areas o f growth and competitiveness

55.
The CAS CR concluded that the growth outcome was achieved. IDA
assistance in this area was designed to help Djibouti to: (i)reform public expenditure,
restructure the utilities
including by reducing the unsustainable share o f the wage bill; (ii)
sector to enhance competitiveness and improve access among poor people; and (iii)
develop the transport sector to enhance the Port o f Djibouti as an engine for growth and
employment. Growth accelerated to 4.8 percent in 2006 and 5.3 in 2007, and i s likely to
remain strong at 5.9 percent in 2008.
The sustainability of this growth path, however, depends on the continued
56.
attraction of foreign investment through reducing factor costs, maintaining fiscal
stability, and upgrading manpower skills. Although the ratio o f tax revenues to GDP
remained stable at about 20 percent, expenditures increased by about 2 percent o f GDP
from 2005 to 2007. Increased spending led to a rise in the fiscal deficit, which was
exacerbated by the 2008 spike in o i l and food prices. According to the D S A conducted by
IMF and World Bank staff in 2008, Djibouti’s risk o f debt distress remains high but
appears manageable. Finally, the CAS C R noted that, during the previous CAS period,
the country failed to address high labor costs and skill shortages, or to restructure utilities
as a means o f restoring financial viability and reducing tariffs.
Outcomes in human resources development

57.
I n the area of human resources development, the CASfocused on a range of
activities: (i)improved access to and quality o f education; (ii)
employment generation
through community development schemes; (iii)assistance for vulnerable groups who

18

were affected by natural catastrophes (particularly floods); and (iv) advancements on key
social issues, such as gender equality, the fight against FGM, and the abuse o f qat.

58.
Tangible results were achieved in education and health. The Gross Enrollment
Ratio (GER) at the primary level increased from 52 percent in 2005 to 68 percent in early
2008, including for girls, and the primary repetition rate was reduced from over 10
percent in 2005 to 4 percent in 2008. Good progress was made in the development of
school management committees, which i s helping to improve results. However,
completion rates have deteriorated over the last school year as a result o f the decision to
shorten the primary cycle from 6 to 5 years. In the health sector, the proportion o f births
taking place in health facilities increased from 40 percent in 2002 to 93 percent in 2008,
and immunization o f children aged 12-23 months grew from 45 percent to 71 percent
during the same period. The prevalence o f HIV among pregnant women aged 15-24
declined from 2.7 percent in 2002 to 2.1 percent in 2007, and among patients being
treated for sexually transmitted infections from 22 percent to 12.6 percent over the same
timeframe. N o information is available on the population’s awareness o f HIV prevention
methods.
59.
Access to basic economic and social infrastructure has improved in 21 poor
neighborhoods covered by the IDA-funded Public Works and Social Development
program. Only 8,300 person-months o f work was created, as compared to the target o f
17,500; i t has become clear that this ambitious target was unrealistic. The capacity o f the
implementing agency, ADDS, has been strengthened. However, the number o f poor
residents benefiting from the IDA-fundedproject i s not well established, and it i s difficult
to assess the operation’s efficiency due to the lack o f economic analysis o f sub-projects.
60.
There is a greater awareness of the negative impact of qat consumption on
labor productivity and health. The planned analysis o f the social and economic
implications o f qat importation and eonsumption at the household and macro level was
not carried out, given limited resources.
Outcomes in economic governance

61.
Outcomes related to improving economic governance were partially achieved.
The CAS aimed to support implementation o f the action plans proposed by the C F A A
and the Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR), both completed in 2004 and
agreed upon with the Government. The Budget Directorate’s capacity to forecast
revenues has improved, and it has acquired new tools to better monitor budget
implementation. However, additional work is needed to better integrate the investment
and recurrent budgets into a medium-term framework and to more closely involve line
ministries in budget preparation and implementation. Financial controls have been
enhanced through capacity building in the Inspector General o f Finance, including the
preparation o f a manual o f procedures and work program, and definition o f a better
division o f labor among the country’s various control institutions.

Portfolio Management

As of end-February 2009, the current IDA portfolio comprisesfive operations.
62.
Total IDA funding volume stands at US$ 43.5 million, with an undisbursed balance o f
US$ 14.5 million. The ongoing IDA program focuses on health, education, energy, and
public works. In addition, as o f February 2009, Djibouti had an active portfolio o f 13
trust fund grants (Bank and country executed) for a total commitment o f U S $ 14.8
million, o f which US$ 2.1 million remains undisbursed (Annex 3). These funds include a
US$ 6 million grant fully disbursed from the Education for All Catalytic Fund, a U S $ 5
million grant fully disbursed from the Global Food Crisis Response Program, a US$ 2
million Avian Flu grant, and other (smaller) grants from the Global Alliance for Vaccines
and Immunization (GAVI), the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the Institutional
Development Fund (IDF), the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP)
and TFSCB. As o f end-February 2009, all projects are rated satisfactory. The
disbursement ratio for the entire portfolio was 44 percent for FY2008, against 34 percent
in FY2007.
Portfolio performance has been broadly satisfactory. In June 2008, the Bank
63.
and the Government completed a Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR). It
concluded that projects in Djibouti are broadly well implemented and reach their
development objectives. Success factors include: (i)focused and simple project design,
intensive supervision o f the portfolio,
adapted to Djibouti’s implementation capacity; (ii)
with a problem-solving approach buttressed by a strong dialogue with the Government
and support from the Country Management Unit; (iii)
strong fiduciary track record; and
(iv) proactive involvement o f the Ministry o f Economy and Finance’s External Financing
Unit in following up with sectoral ministries and Project Implementation Units (PIUs).

64.
The CPPR highlighted some generic portfolio management issues for
slow start o f projects, as exemplified by delays
particular attention. These include: (i)
between project approval and effectiveness; (ii)
procurement delays; (iii)
need for better
integration o f project monitoring and evaluation functions in the line ministries; (iv) need
for an increased role for government institutions (such as the C ow des Comptes) in
project management, such as in project audits; and (v) need for stronger capacity in the
daily management o f trust fund grants. An action plan has been drawn up to address these
issues, and i s under implementation by the Government.

V.

PROPOSED WORLD BANK STRATEGY

A.

Guiding Principles

The CAS for FY2009-2012 is aligned with the INDS. Through both the
65.
existing portfolio and new lending, the Bank Group will support the implementation o f
the four-year INDS and help achieve a number o f INDS goals. The CAS results
framework i s directly aligned with development outcomes derived from the INDS. The
program o f assistance was discussed with the Government, donors, private sector, and
civil society during CAS consultations in Djibouti between November 2008 and February
2009.

20

66.
The new CAS is highly selective. Considering the Bank’s experience in
Djibouti, the limited IDA envelope, other stakeholders’ activities in the country, and the
lessons learned about effective development approaches in small states, l3Bank support
will target only a few activities. The Bank will provide a grant for one project per year
and undertake one or two analytical studies per year, while maintaining a constructive
dialogue in a broader set o f sectors through technical assistance.
The new CAS is built on the success of the current portfolio. There are large
67.
financing needs in all sectors. However, given limited capacity on the Government side
and the Bank’s experience in few sectors, the proposed CAS intends to focus on areas
where the Bank has a solid performance record. In particular, wherever possible, the CAS
will provide additional financing for projects that have achieved their development
objectives in order to scale up impact and strengthen development effectiveness.

68.
Bank activities will reflect the Bank’s comparative advantage and complement
the work of other donors. The choice o f activities to be supported in this CAS depends
largely on the Government’s priorities, but also on the extent and nature o f support being
provided by other donors. Care will be taken to avoid the duplication o f interventions and
emphasis will be placed o n activities where the Bank has a comparative advantage in
light o f other donors’ involvement, expertise, and financial contributions. Co-financing
programs with other donors will be considered as a means to leverage the Bank’s limited
financial contribution.
The overall size of the IDA envelope during the CASperiod is assumed to be
69.
about SDR 16 mi1li0n.l~The CAS covers the period FY2009-2012, which includes the
and the first year o f IDA16. The FY2009 allocation
entire IDA15 period (FY2009-201 l),
will be SDR 3.6 million. Allocations for FY2010-2012 are expected to be about SDR 3.8
million per year, on average, but these estimates can change. Actual allocations in these
years will depend on: (i)
total available IDA resources; (ii)
the country’s performance
the
rating according to the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA); (iii)
performance and assistance terms o f other IDA borrowers; (iv) the terms o f IDA’S
assistance to Djibouti (grants or credits); and (v) the number o f IDA-eligible countries.
The indicative allocation for FY2012 assumes that the I D A 1 6 replenishment will be at
the same level as in IDA15. Since Djibouti i s in debt distress, it will receive all i t s
allocations in the form o f grants unless i t s debt sustainability position changes.

70.
This CAS intends to leverage IDA grants through access to global funds.
Given that the IDA allocation is limited in comparison to the country’s financing needs,
the Bank will continue to seek to leverage these resources through access to global funds
(e.g., Carbon Fund, EFA, GEF, IDA Guarantees) and to work with Djibouti to improve
i t s CPIA rating (and hence its IDA allocation) in the short to medium term.

B.

Proposed Assistance Strategy

71.
With the above principles in mind, the Bank Group strategv is articulated
supporting economic growth; (ii)
around three core objectives. The CAS themes are: (i)
supporting access to basic social services and human development; and (iii)
supporting
governance and public sector management.
CAS Theme 1: Supporting economic growth
72.
Reducing constraints and associated costs to private sector development (CAS
Outcome 1.1). Accelerating economic growth will require strengthening the business
environment by reducing the constraints and costs o f doing business in Djibouti. Building
o n the assistance that began under the previous CAS, the Bank will support the
Government’s efforts t o boost private sector development by: (i)
increasing access to, and
reliability ‘and quality o f service delivery in the electricity and telecommunications
sectors; (ii)reducing the cost o f electricity and telecommunications services; (iii)
improving the efficiency o f public utilities for electricity, water, and telecommunications;
and (iv) strengthening the financial sector. The Bank program will involve a combination
o f lending in the power sector and technical assistance to enhance the business
environment.

73.
Ongoing assistance. Through the ongoing Power Access and Diversification
project (US$ 7 million), the Bank has helped EDD expand electricity distribution and
identify key system efficiency gaps; it has also provided funds to buy fuel for electricity
generation, thus offering relief to EDD’s strained finances and, in turn, reducing the fiscal
cost o f the sector while assessing opportunities for better fuel procurement practices. In
addition, ongoing technical assistance to the design o f a master plan for electricity will
support more effective and economically sound planning for new investments in the
electricity sector.
Planned assistance. Through a proposed new energy project (US$ 6.2 million),
74.
the Bank will help Djibouti to: (i)
improve access to electricity through targeted energy
efficiency and demand-side management measures that would reduce the user cost o f
electricity, while shaving o f f peak demand and tapering EDD’s need for large, capitalintensive investments in new generation capacity; and (ii)improve EDD’s overall
performance through high-impact technical and non-technical loss reduction measures
that would increase the reliability and quality o f electricity services at a lower operating
cost.

75.
The Bank’s technical assistance in the telecommunications sector will provide
recommendations for policy and regulatory reform. Technical assistance will also be
provided to assess the needs, priorities, and challenges in enhancing the country’s
business environment and investment climate. The Bank has undertaken, jointly with the
IMF, an FSAP t o help design measures to strengthen the banking regulatory framework.
This exercise is motivated by the fact that the banking sector has expanded rapidly and
undergone substantial structural changes in the past three years, including the closure o f

22

ailing banks. Similarly, technical assistance may be provided to help the Central Bank o f
Djibouti manage i t s foreign exchange reserves.
76.
IFC. In an effort to support the development o f alternative sources o f energy in
Djibouti, IFC made an early stage equity investment with Reykjavik Energy Invest to
develop a geothermal power project in FY2008. This was the first investment by the new
InfraVentures facility, intended to provide seed funding to promising projects that are not
yet able to secure full funding. The project has encountered delays, including as a result
o f the financial crisis in Iceland and the general uncertainty o f raising the balance o f
funding required following the global financial crisis. IFC i s currently working with the
sponsor group to undertake initial test drilling, raise the additional capital required, and
complete the feasibility assessment. If these activities proceed with strong results, the
project could be structured and financed by end-FY2010. If implemented, the project
could help Djibouti address i t s power shortage and reduce carbon emissions.
77.
MIGA. MIGA has a substantial engagement in Djibouti. In December 2007,
MIGA issued US$ 427 million in investment guarantees related to the development,
design, construction, management, operation, and maintenance o f a container terminal in
Doraleh. At the time o f i t s issuance, this constituted MIGA’s largest single project
exposure. This ongoing coverage extends for a period o f 10 years against the risks o f
transfer restriction, expropriation, war and civil disturbance, and breach o f contract. The
project, sponsored by investors from the United Arab Emirates, i s expected to help
Djibouti become a major business hub in East Africa by improving facilities, increasing
port traffic, and opening up new opportunities for investment and growth (such as
attracting other African countries to use the port as a gateway as well). If FDI remains
significant, MIGA would be willing to provide more assistance as needed.
CAS Theme 2: Supporting access to basic social services and human development
Increase access to quality basic education (CAS Outcome 2.1). The Bank has
been involved in this area over the past four years, in collaboration with key donors such
as the AfDB, Islamic Development Bank (IsDB), United States, France, and Japan.
During this CAS period, the Bank will continue to work closely with other donors to
support the Government’s efforts to: (i)further expand access to basic education,
especially in rural areas and for girls, including by reducing dropout and repetition rates;
and (ii)
enhance the quality o f education, especially by increasing teacher training and the
availability o f school books.

78.

79.
Ongoing assistance. IDA w i l l continue to support the implementation o f the
Government’s education reform agenda with a US$ 10 million School Access and
Improvement project. This project has been implemented in parallel with an F T I
education grant o f US$6 million, managed by the Bank.

80.
Planned assistance. The CAS will launch an Education. and Vocational
Training project (about U S $ 6 million) to further expand school access, improve
retention, reduce repetition and dropout rates, and strengthen the capacity o f the public
training system to build the types o f skills needed by employers. Moreover, an additional

23

US$2 million FTI education grant will continue to help increase equitable access to basic
education and improve the quality and efficiency o f the education system.
81.
Improve access to and quality of health services (CAS Outcome 2.2). During
the CAS period, the Bank will help the Government improve access to and quality o f
health services in a sustainable manner in order to contribute to the achievement o f the
MDGs related to reducing malnutrition, stemming child and maternal mortality, and
combating communicable diseases.
82.
Ongoing assistance. The Bank will continue to implement the ongoing Health
Sector Development project (US$ 15 million), which aims to help reduce maternal and
infant mortality rates. In addition, work will continue on an existing IDF grant (US$ 2
million) to help Djibouti contain and prevent the emergence o f Highly Pathogenic Avian
Influenza (HPAI) in domestic poultry, and to prepare for, control, and respond to an
influenza pandemic as well as other infectious disease emergencies in humans.
83.
Planned assistance. The CAS will provide additional financing o f US$ 7
million to the health sector program to support the Government’s efforts to: (i)
improve
the quality o f maternal and child health services; (ii)
improve the quality o f prevention
and treatment o f communicable diseases; and (iii)
improve the performance o f health
systems, including health worker qualifications and availability o f drugs.
Strengthen social protection and direct support to the poor (CAS Outcome
84.
2.3). The Bank has engaged in an active policy dialogue with the Government o f Djibouti
the development o f an action plan to
on social protection and food security through: (i)
improve social safety nets, in connection with the GFRP Development Policy Grant; (ii)
the financing o f basic economic and social infrastructure to increase community
development opportunities in poor areas o f Djibouti, through the Flood Emergency
Rehabilitation and Urban Poverty Reduction projects; and (iii)
assistance provided to
pension reform.

85.
Ongoing assistance. During the CAS period, the Bank will continue to engage
in dialogue to help Djibouti to: (i)
mitigate the vulnerability o f the poor, including against
recurrent floods, droughts, food insecurity, and other external shocks; (ii)
improve the
assess the extent and causes o f poverty;
institutional framework for social protection; (iii)
and (iv) propose a strategy to ameliorate its effects.
86.
Planned assistance. The Bank will provide a Water and Small-scale Rural
Development project (US$ 5 million) to retain water in wadis for small-scale agriculture
and livestock, prevent floods, and recharge the aquifer. If trust funds for social protection
or food security become available, additional financial support will be provided. Bank
assistance will also engage in policy dialogue and technical assistance on: (i)
social
development o f a sustainable solid waste collection
protection and food security; (ii)
system, using small-scale private operators; and (iii)establishment o f a vulnerability
information system with funding from the Global Fund for Disaster Reduction and
Recovery (GFDRR). A Poverty Assessment will help assess the nature, incidence, and
dynamics o f poverty in Djibouti, as well as the evolution o f income distribution. It will

24

also help assess the progress achieved during PRSP implementation (2004-2006) and
propose options for policy and institutional reforms t o feed into the design o f the next
poverty reduction strategy. A study o n qat will enable the Bank to strengthen i t s dialogue
on qat with all stakeholders in Djibouti and present options for discouraging qat
consumption.

CAS Theme 3: Supporting governance and public sector management

87.

Improve expenditure transparency (CAS Outcome 3.1). Bank assistance in this
area has supported the improvement o f financial management and public procurement
improving
through implementation o f the 2004 CFAA recommendations, including: (i)
budget planning; (ii)
reforming internal control procedures and upgrading internal audit;
and (iii)
reinforcing coordination among the three main audit bodies. The latter two
recommendations have been only partially implemented. The Bank will continue to
support the Government in these areas through further policy dialogue and technical
assistance, including on the design and implementation o f a governance and anticorruption diagnostic survey. A Public Expenditure Review will also be conducted.

88.
Improve monitoring and evaluation (CAS Outcome 3.2). For the last three
years, the Bank has provided assistance through a trust fund for statistical capacity
building that has helped to improve the production o f national accounts and to prepare the
population census launched in March 2009. Once the census i s completed, the country
will need additional assistance to implement i t s Statistical Master Plan (SMP), drafted in
2005. If funds for statistical capacity building are available, the Bank may provide
financial support in coordination with other donors. In addition, technical assistance will
be provided to establish and operationalize an effective monitoring and evaluation system
for the INDS, to put in place an aid coordination and management system, and to enhance
the Government’s capacity to collect, process, and analyze donor information and data.
Finally, capacity building grants may be raised t o provide assistance in selected sectors.

Partnerships and Participation

89.
Djibouti benefits from the support of a small group of bilateral donors (e.g.,
France, United States, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait) and multilateral
donors (Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, IsDB, AfDB, European
Commission, OPEC Fund for International Development, United Nations agencies, IMF,
and World Bank).
90.
Currently, there is no formal framework for donor coordination. However,
given the small size o f the donor community, information sharing among donors i s easy.
Although the World Bank does not have an office in Djibouti, Bank managers and task
team leaders visiting the country are able to conduct regular discussions with their
donors' counterparts. Donor collaboration in Djibouti has led to the parallel financing o f
the Urban Poverty Reduction Program by the Agence Franqaise de De'veloppement
(AFD), AfDB, IsDB, and the World Bank. The Bank's US$ 3 million contribution was
substantially leveraged to a total o f U S $ 38.5 million, which is helping to address
infrastructure needs in the poorest neighborhoods o f Djibouti-Ville and five secondary
centers. In the education sector, several partners are providing financial andor technical
support for the implementation o f Djibouti's education reform agenda, especially with

through i t s education project. Moreover, the Catalytic Fund for Education for Allfunded by France, USAID, UNICEF, AFD, Arab Development Fund and the W o r l d Bank
and managed by the World Bank-has been a unifying force among donors.

A Donor Meeting is planned for 2009, and will be co-organized by the
Government and the World Bank. The meeting will be used as a platform for the
Government to raise awareness among donors o n current and planned economic and
social reforms, as well as o n the challenges the country faces. The meeting will help the
authorities make the case for increased external assistance.

91.

92.

This CAS was prepared in close collaboration with the donor community, and
is designed to complement other donors’ efforts. In key areas, such as the Power and
Urban Poverty Reduction projects, IDA’Slending assistance has been prepared in close
collaboration with AfDB, IsDB, and AFD and complements their investments in these
sectors. As shown in the CAS results matrix (Annex 1)’ there are many synergies
between IDA assistance and other donors’ proposed interventions. These links will be
clarified further as donors continue to consult with the Government o n defining their
respective assistance to the INDS investment program.
. The World Bank will continue its strong collaboration with the IMF to ensure
93.
that a consistent message is conveyed regarding macroeconomic, public finance
management, and other structural reforms. The Bank’s technical assistance o n I N D S
monitoring and evaluation will reinforce and complement the IMF’s recently concluded
PRGF program.

VI.

MANAGING R I S K S

94.

The realization of Djibouti’s national initiative for social development, and
the effectiveness of this CAS which is aligned to it, are subject to several external and
internal risks.

95 *
Djibouti’s economy depends mainly on the port and its development, the
rental of military bases, and grants and soft financing from donors-all of which are
subject to external geo-political and financial uncertainties. The surge in the growth o f
port activities with Ethiopia since the end o f the 1990s i s attributable t o the war between
Ethiopia and Eritrea, and Ethiopia’s subsequent reliance o n the Port o f Djibouti for most
o f its imports and exports. To limit the risk that this increase in the share o f Ethiopian
trade traffic will be reversed, Djibouti needs to improve the overall competitiveness o f
the port by reducing costs and improving transport links (road and railways) t o Ethiopia.
This risk is being mitigated through the ongoing modernization o f the Port o f Djibouti,
and the construction o f a container terminal and o i l terminal and creation o f a Free Zone
at the Port o f Doraleh. There is also the prospect that large investments f r o m the United
Arab Emirates may support the development o f Djibouti as a transshipment hub.
19

Partners include AfDB, IsDB, AFD, Japan, the World Food Program (WFP), the United Nations
Children’s Fund (UNICEF), and the World Bank.

27

Djibouti faces the risk of lower FDI flows if the global financial and
economic crisis persists and affects Djibouti’s main partners. A s stressed in section 11,
although many planned investment projects for 2009 and 2010 have been re-confirmed, a
few projects can be jeopardized, if the global crisis hits hard the home countries o f main
investors. If this happens, the authorities would likely have limited leverage t o mitigate
such a development and would rely o n a tightening o f the fiscal position in response to a
decrease in revenues. External assistance, in terms o f technical assistance and financial
support, would be needed t o help mitigate the impact o f such a shock.

96.

97.
Djibouti is located in an unstable region that has experienced many wars and
episodes of civil unrest. In M a y 2008, border tensions with Eritrea led to brief fighting
between the two countries’ armies. The situation is n o w stable, though there have been no
direct negotiations between the two parties. Djibouti’s high refugee population, a result o f
regional instability, creates tensions around access to already scarce national resources,
such as food, water, and land for grazing. There i s a risk that regional security conditions
could worsen and the number o f refugees would increase. This situation would likely lead
to fiscal unsustainability due to increased spending o n defense and internal security, as
well as the additional service needs o f the refugee population. Such conditions would also
affect the Bank’s ability to implement i t s programs. This risk will be closely monitored
throughout the CAS period. Another important regional risk is linked to sea piracy in the
Gulf o f Aden, as this can pose a threat to trade through the Port o f Djibouti. In a bid to
address the insecurity and instability that has allowed the piracy to grow, the Government
is continuing to play an active role in facilitating discussions on the future o f the
government in Somalia. It will also coordinate its efforts with the Government o f Yemen.
98.
The Bank’s limited financial assistance could also pose risks for the
effectiveness of the CASprogram. It i s possible that the Government may not consider
the financial support under the CAS sufficient for them to invest in pursuing a long-term
dialogue and relationship with the Bank. The Bank will offset this risk by working to
ensure greater engagement and mutual understanding o n the CAS with the Djiboutian
Government and stakeholders, in order to highlight the Bank’s value in bringing to bear a
variety o f non-financial instruments o f assistance, including policy advice, analytical
work, and technical assistance based o n the Bank’s global knowledge and reach, support
to I N D S implementation, access t o global funds, and a convening power that can help
leverage other donors’ assistance for greater development effectiveness in Djibouti.
99.
Another source of risk relates to the Government’s limited capacity to
implement and monitor the INDS. Full implementation o f the I N D S program implies a
significant increase in Djibouti’s public investment program in a context o f relatively l o w
skill levels and limited budgetary, administrative, and management capacity. Experience
from the previous CAS shows that well-focused projects with simple design and close
and proactive supervision, together with additional capacity building assistance, can
significantly minimize this risk. The highly selective approach to defining the proposed
CAS program will also help address this risk. Nonetheless, institutional capacity
constraints could potentially limit the Government’s ability t o utilize fully and effectively
the increased support from other donors. IDA will keep this broader issue under review.

Annex 2: Djibouti’s FY2005-2008 CAS Completion Report

Date o f CAS: March 1,2005
Period covered by CAS Completion Report: FY2005-2008

I.INTRODUCTION

1.
This annex reviews the experience implementing the International Development
Association’s (IDA) Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the period FY05-08 (Report 3 1613-DJ)
dated March 1, 2005, which was endorsed by the Board on March 24, 2005. It assesses the
effectiveness o f IDA’S strategy in (i)aligning i t s objectives with Djibouti’s long-term strategic
goals; (ii)
setting relevant, measurable and realistic CAS outcomes; and (iii)
achieving i t s expected
outcomes in an efficient and sustainable way. It evaluates IDA’S performance in designing i t s
strategy taking past assessments and lessons into consideration (such as Independent Evaluation
Group - IEG - evaluations); and presents a set o f lessons for subsequent CAS design. In addition to
discussions with the country team and government counterparts, this assessment i s based on
reference documents such as the CAS, Project Appraisal Documents (PADS) Implementation Status
and Results Reports (ISRs), supervision reports (Aide-Memoires, and Back-to office Reports),
reports related to Economic and Sector Work, Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs), and
Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) reports and Project Assessments.

11. Context o f the 2005-2008 CAS
11. a. Djibouti.LongerTerm Strategic Goals
2.
Djibouti adopted i t s first Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP-I) in M a y 2004, in a
context marked by a worrying surge in poverty and glaring disparities between rural and urban
areas. The PRSP aimed at: (i)
strengthening competitiveness for higher and sustainable growth by
maintaining overall macroeconomic stability, while speeding up structural reforms to create a better
investment climate for private investment; (ii)
accelerating human development through improved
school enrollment and quality o f education, strengthening the health care system, broadening the
social safety net; and implementing the national gender strategy; (iii)
promoting regional and local
development to reach out to poor urban neighborhoods, nomads, and isolated rural communities;
and (iv) improving governance and public sector management through greater transparency and
accountability.
3.
Good progress was made in achieving the objectives o f PRSP-I. Economic growth
accelerated from 1.6 percent in 2004 t o 4.8 percent in 2006 and 5.3 percent estimated for 2007,
fuelled by increased inflow o f foreign direct investment in port-related activities and construction.
Progress was also made in improving key social indicators. According to the 2006 household
survey (EDIM), progress was made in improving access to primary education (enrollment rates
increased from 42.7 percent in 2000 to 66.2 percent in 2006), increasing alphabetization among
young females, and reducing infant mortality. Djibouti was able to maintain macroeconomic
stability, accelerate growth and improve some social indicators, but there i s little indication that
poverty has been reduced.

4.
Implementation o f the PRS-I slowed down after the first year, and planned programs were
only partially implemented, particularly in the second pillar o f developing human capital. Resource

33

gaps, administrative capacity constraints and the lack o f an effective monitoring and evaluation
system are the main reasons behind the poor and limited implementation o f the strategy. Learning
from the PRSP-I weaknesses, the Government adopted a National Initiative for Social Development
(Initiative Nationale pour le De'veloppement Social - INDS) in January 2008. This i s a provisional
document, which would be finalized following completion o f the demographic census. The INDS
reviewed progress under the PRSP-I. It emphasized achievements in the social sectors, but noted
that PRSP-I never became the sole frame o f reference for decision-makers, and that the culture o f
planning was not well established among the authorities. Key indicators o f progress under PRSP-1
are in Table 1 below.

11. b. The 2005-2008 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
5.
The 2005-08 CAS indicated that solid performance had been achieved under the previous
CAS (2001-04), marking a clear departure from the past. After a long period o f c i v i l strife and
deepening poverty in the 1990s, growth and macroeconomic stability were restored. Performance o f
the portfolio improved dramatically. During the consultation process for preparing the CAS, the
Bank team and the authorities discussed two options. The first option was to target one o f the four
pillars to bring about critical change in that particular area, taking account o f limited IDA
allocation. The second option was to use small but strategic interventions mixing lending and
economic and sector work (ESW) in each o f the four areas. The second option was selected. The
risk o f the approach was to spread limited resources too thinly. W i t h the benefit o f hindsight,
however, the option selected enabled the Bank to advance the country dialogue across the board.
6.
The 2005-2008 CAS was broadly aligned with the priorities outlined in the four pillars o f
Djibouti's PRSP. The CAS focused on three broad themes: (i)competitiveness and growth; (ii)
human resources development and poverty alleviation; and (iii)
good governance. The relevance o f
the CAS outcomes to the longer term strategic goals has not changed during implementation.

7.
In support o f the first pillar (growth and competitiveness), IDA'Sassistance was designed t o
help Djibouti (i)
reform public expenditure, including a reduction o f the unsustainable share o f the
restructure the utilities sector to enhance competitiveness and improve access o f the
wage bill; (ii)
develop the transport sector as a way o f enhancing the Port o f Djibouti as an engine
poor; and (iii)
for growth and employment. In the area o f human resource development, the CAS argued for
improved school access and quality o f education; (ii)
employment
continuation o f the support to (i)
generation through community development schemes; (iii)vulnerable groups who are victims o f
natural catastrophes (flood in particular); and (iv) advancing key social issues (gender equality and

fight against female genital mutilation and the abuse o f Qat - a stimulant). T o promote good
governance, the CAS indicated that it would support implementation o f the action plans proposed
by the Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) and the Country Procurement
Assessment Report (CPAR) - both completed in 2004 - and agreed upon with the authorities.

111. CAS Outcomes
CAS Theme 1: Improving competitiveness, growth and income distribution

8.
Under this broad CAS objective, three actions were envisaged. Creating fiscal space to
expand priority public services was to be achieved through reducing the share o f the public wage
bill in total expenditure and recruiting additional public service professionals at the expense o f
administrative and security personnel. The main instrument for this outcome was the policy
dialogue through the preparation and discussion o f a Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) and
o f the Public Expenditure Review (PER). Both the C E M and the PER were completed in 2006. The
C E M made forcefully the case that, in the absence o f reforms aimed at reducing the high production
costs and addressing the paucity o f skilled workers, Djibouti would remain locked in a trap o f slow
growth, high poverty and high unemployment. It stressed that rents derived from Djibouti strategic
location (military revenues, foreign aid and port receipts) were channeled through the government
budget and captured by the civil service elite in the form o f high wages and fringe benefits.
9.
The second action proposed in the CAS was the restructuring o f high cost utilities, t o
improve the competitiveness o f the economy and access o f the poor to basic services. Average
tariffs for electricity and water at US$0.20/kWh (US$26/kWh for industries) and U S $ I . l / m 3
respectively were among the highest in the region. These high tariffs were the result o f reliance on
costly imported diesel, high network losses, overstaffing and high taxation. The CAS proposed a
dual power and water project and a GEF grant for renewable and energy efficiency.
10. A power project was approved in July 2005. I t s objectives were to increase access o f the poor
to electricity through expansion o f distribution, testing the feasibility o f using wind energy and
improving the performance o f the utility through technical assistance. The wind component was
eventually abandoned, however, because o f delays in procurement and increased cost o f equipment
due to fast growing world demand. The project was restructured in 2008 to help the utility meet a
hugely increased bill for imported diesel oil. Interconnection with Ethiopia and the development o f
geothermal energy with IFC support are expected t o lower the cost o f electricity in the mediumterm. The inefficiencies in the management o f the utility remain to be forcefully addressed,
however. The water component o f the project was abandoned, as the European Union agreed to
provide assistance to the sector.

11. The third action proposed in the CAS to support the Port o f Djibouti as the main engine o f
economic growth and employment generation was the development and rehabilitation o f the
transport infrastructure. Over the past decade, the port activity increased considerably, as a result o f
(i)changing traffic patterns following the Ethiopia-Eritrea war in 1997; (ii)the government
decision to transfer the management o f the port to Dubai Port International (DPI) in 2000; and (iii)
the rehabilitation o f the road link to Ethiopia, with Bank support. The CAS proposed t o support the
privatization o f the Djibouti-Ethiopia rail link through the provision o f a partial IDA guarantee for a
concession scheme. No progress has been made in that respect, however, as the selection o f a
private operator dragged on and was not successful. The CAS mentioned also that a transport sector
review was being carried out. The study, issued in April 2004, made technical recommendations on
how to improve the role and efficiency o f the Port o f Djibouti.

35

12. Outcome 1 (growth): Increase average annual GDP growth to 4.5 percent in 2008.
Achieved. Growth accelerated to 4.8 percent in 2006 and 5.3 in 2007. Sustainability o f that
outcome i s dependent on continued attraction o f foreign investment through reduction o f factor
cost, fiscal stability and upgrading manpower skills, however.
13. Outcome 2 (fiscal stability): Improve fiscal stability by maintaining the fiscal deficit to less
than 2 percent o f GDP. N o t achieved. Fiscal policy was expansionary in 2006 and 2007. Tax
revenue to GDP remained stable at about 20 percent, but expenditure increased by about 2
percentage points o f GDP from 2005 to 2007. The sharp o i l and food prices increases in 2008
underscored the vulnerability o f the budget t o external factors.
14. Outcome 3 (debt sustainability): Maintain external debt within sustainable limits. Not
achieved. A debt sustainability analysis was conducted by the IMF and World Bank staff in 2008.
Almost all borrowing i s from official lenders, and most o f it i s concessional. The analysis
concluded, however, that the country’s risk o f debt distress i s high. Djibouti’s ratio o f net present
value (NPV) debt-to-GDP ratio i s expected to remain well above the threshold o f 30 percent for
countries rated as “poor performers” (according to the Country Performance and Institutional
Assessment - CPIA) over the next 20 years. Djibouti has also incurred external arrears in past
years.
15. Outcome 4 (cost o f factors): reduce the cost o f factors by addressing high labor cost and
skill shortages, issue a new labor code, and restructure utilities to restore financial viability and
reduce tariffs. N o t achieved. The CAS mentioned that the wage bill absorbed about 15 percent o f
GDP and half o f budget expenditures. During the CAS period, these percentages declined slightly
to 14.6 percent and 49.6 percent respectively in 2007. A physical audit o f the c i v i l service was
completed and a single registry o f civil servants was established in 2007. These instruments should
help with the restructuring o f the civil service in line with development priorities. Under a high case
scenario, a second fiscal consolidation credit was envisaged. Such credit was not extended,
however, as Djibouti did not meet the criteria for moving to high case. A new labor code was
adopted in December 2005, but i s s t i l l not effective for lack o f implementingdecrees. The financial
viability o f utilities has not been restored and tariffs have not been reduced.
CAS Theme 2: Human resource development and poverty alleviation

16. In support o f this broad objective, the CAS proposed the continuation o f programs for
education improvement, employment generation in poor neighborhoods, and rehabilitation o f
infrastructure in poor areas devastated by floods in 2004. A second phase o f an Adaptable Program
Lending (APL) for education was approved in 2005, to improve access to, and the quality and
efficiency o f primary education. The Djibouti Urban Poverty Reduction Project, a second phase o f
an APL, was approved in April 2008 to increase access to and use o f local infrastructure and basic
urban services, community development and micro-finance by the poor segments o f the population
o f Djibouti and secondary centers. Following devastating floods, which exposed the vulnerabilities
o f a large number o f poor families, an Emergency Floods Rehabilitation project was approved in
September 2004, with additional financing in February 2007.
17. Outcome 5 (education): Increase (i)
gross enrollment ratio (GER) to 73 percent in 2008, (ii)
ratio o f girls to total student population from 44 percent in 2003 to 48 percent in 2008; and (iii)
student 6-11 old completing primary schooling from 55 percent in 2003 to 80 percent in 2008.
Partiallv achieved. The Gross Enrollment Rate (GER) increased from 52 percent in 2005 t o 68
percent in early 2008, including for girls, and the primary repetition rate was reduced from over 10

36

percent in 2005 to 4 percent in 2008. Completion rates have deteriorated in the last school year,
however, as a result o f the decision to shorten the primary cycle from 6 t o 5 years. Good progress
has been made in the development o f school management committees, which i s helping t o improve
results. Further expansion o f the education system may not be sustainable, however, in the absence
o f a reduction o f teachers’ wages and a better allocation o f resources in the education budget in
favor o f the poor.
18. Outcome 6 (health): Reduce infant mortality rate (IMR) to 85 per 1000 live births and
maternal mortality rate (h4MR) to 570 per 1000,000 live births in 2006; and ensure that at least 80
percent o f the population i s aware o f at least 3 measures to prevent transmission o f HIV/AIDS.
Achieved. In the health sector, the ongoing project helped increase the proportion o f birth in health
facilities, from 40 percent in 2002 to 93 percent in 2008 and the vaccination rate o f children 12-23
months from 45 percent to 71 percent during the same period. The reduction in the IMR was
stronger than expected. No information i s available on MMR, however. The ongoing HIV/AIDS
project reported a decline in HIV prevalence rate among 15-24 year old pregnant women from 2.7
percent in 2002 to 2.1 percent at end 2007 and among sexually transmitted diseases (STD) patients
from 22 percent to 12.6 percent during the same period. N o information was provided on the
population’s awareness on HIV prevention in implementation status reports (ISRs), however.
19. Outcome 7 (employment and social protection): Develop high-labor intensive public
works in support o f the rehabilitation o f basic services and community development. Partially
achieved. The I C R for the first phase o f the social development and public works project was issued
in March 2008. It indicated that access to basic economic and social infrastructure has been
improved in 21 poor neighborhoods, but only 8,300 person-months o f work was created compared
to the target o f 17,500, which was deemed unrealistic, however. The capacity o f the implementing
agency has been strengthened. From available documentation, the number o f poor residents
benefitting from the project i s not well established, however, and it i s difficult to assess the
efficiency o f the operation because there was no economic analysis o f sub-projects. The flood
emergency rehabilitation project, closing in FY09, has so far helped rehabilitate social
infrastructure destroyed by the 2004 floods, resettle 360 families, and set-up an executive
secretariat for disaster management.
,

20.
Within the framework o f a poverty assessment, an analysis o f the social and economic
implications o f Qat import and consumption at the household and macro level was to be carried out.
Given Bank limited resources, however, focus was put on raising awareness through high-level
country dialogue. In February 2008, the Qat issue was discussed between the President o f Djibouti
and the MNA Vice President. In July 2008, the Government launched a public campaign aimed at
sensitizing the population about the negative consequences o f Qat consumption (distortion o f
household expenditure, loss o f working time and reduced economic productivity). The campaign
received much press attention and triggered public debate, in particular as it equated the health and
economic risk o f Qat consumption with those o f tobacco and alcohol.

CAS Theme 3: Promoting good governance
21. Two IDF grants were extended in September 2005 to build capacity, the f i r s t one for
US$0.36 million in public procurement reform, and the second one for U S 0 . 3 4 million in the
Ministry o f Finance. Under the first project, a new public procurement code has been prepared, but
has not yet been adopted. With support from the second one, budget preparation has improved, but
additional work i s needed to better integrate the investment and current budgets within a mediumt e r m framework and involve line ministries in budget preparation and implementation. In spite of

37

training, internal and external financial controls are s t i l l weak. Good progress was made in
budgetary discipline, including a reduction in domestic arrears.
22. Outcome 8: Improve economic governance through efficient and transparent procurement
and training o f staff on new customs information management tools. N o t achieved. Procurement
under Bank-financed project has marginally improved, but not in country systems. There was no
improvement in customs’ use o f modern management tools.
23. Outcome 9: Improve public finance management (budget preparation, realism o f budget and
consistency with medium-term economic framework and PRSP, internal and external controls,
parliamentary oversight, cash management and efficiency o f ex ante controls). Partially achieved.
The Budget Directorate has been strengthened. I t s capacity to forecast revenues has been improved
and it has acquired new tools to better monitor budget implementation. Financial controls have been
enhanced through capacity building o f the General Inspectorate o f Finance (IGF), including
preparation o f a manual o f procedures and a work program, and a better division o f labor between
control institutions, IGF, General State Inspectorate and the Chamber o f Accounts.

Overall Assessment
24.
Implementation o f the assistance program has contributed to improving social indicators, but
has not done much to address the competitiveness agenda and governance issues, two areas where
the Government was not strongly committed to reforms. During the CAS period, foreign direct
investment increased steadily, from US$59 million in 2005 to US$197 million in 2007, mostly from
Arab sources. This surge contributed to the strategy o f the Government to transform Djibouti into a
regional trade and services hub, but it might have weakened i t s resolve to undertake difficult
reforms. Also, expectations that Arab o i l producers would provide petroleum products at below
world market prices gave the authorities a false sense o f security. When o i l prices hit an all time
high in mid-2008, they had no other option than to request the Bank to help pay the bills o f the
power utility.
25. The assistance program was appropriate. It helped Djibouti move to a second generation
PRSP and better focus on poverty reduction issues. Some steps have been taken to start the process
o f civil service reform, which i s essential for making the budget more pro-poor over time.
Insufficient attention was given to addressing the competitiveness agenda, however. The CEM
focused sharply on that issue, but little has been done in the lending program to lower costs o f
factors or improve the skills o f the labor force. The power project could have been an opportunity
to help Djibouti restructure i t s utility, but i t s main emphasis was on extending distribution, not
reducing extremely high costs. In the education sector, no attempt was made to adjust teachers’
salaries. Achieving universal primary education i s simply not feasible when the average salary o f a
civil servant i s 10 times the average income per capita.

IV. Bank Performance
Quality o f Products and Services
26. The CAS was implemented under the base case scenario o f about US$31.4 million o f
IDA credits. During FY05-08, 4 out o f 5 operations planned under the base case scenario were
delivered, for US$28.5 million, o f which US$5.1 million in grants. These included the flood
emergency and rehabilitation project and i t s additional financing, the power project (approved
without the water component), the second phase o f the school access and improvement, and the
urban poverty reduction project. In addition, the Bank showed flexibility in helping Djibouti

38

address the 2008 food and o i l crises, by extending a grant to compensate the loss o f tax revenues
when the Government removed the consumption tax on key food staples, and by restructuring the
power project to finance the power utility's o i l bill.
27. The Bank raised resources to complement I D A funding. During the CAS period, the Bank
made extensive use o f IDF grants and similar facilities. Besides the two grants mentioned above for
improving procurement and public finance management, the Bank approved (i)
a US$0.25 million
grant under the t r u s t fund for statistical capacity building to support the Statistics Office in February
2006, (ii)a US$6 million grant under the Education for all - Fast track initiative (EFA-FTI)
Catalytic Trust Fund in M a y 2006, (iii)a US$2.1 million grant under the Avian and Human
Influenza (AHI) Facility in October 2006, (iv) a US$0.24 million IDF grant to help the Government
streamline i t s pension system in August 2007, and (v) a U S 0 . 2 9 million IDF grant to help the
Government establish an effective M&E system for the MDS in April 2008. Activities under these
grants are s t i l l ongoing. W h i l e satisfactory progress was made in education and Avian flu, delays
were encountered in statistics and pension reform.
28. The CAS design was adequate. Building on progress made under the previous CAS, it
supported implementation o f key objectives o f the first PRSP. During the consultation process for
preparation o f the CAS, the Government and the Bank selected the option o f covering several areas
o f the PRSP, instead o f focusing on one o f the four pillars. The expected benefit o f the approach
was to use Bank involvement as a catalyst for increased donor assistance in support o f the PRSP.
This approach was successful in the urban poverty reduction program (parallel financing by the
African Development Bank, the Islamic Development Bank and o f the Agence F r a n p i s e de
De'veloppement), and in the education sector (additional financing from the catalytic fund for
education for all). The mix o f instruments to achieve the CAS objectives was also adequate.
29. However, the Bank work was not always sequenced properly. During CAS
implementation, while the economic and sector work focused on how to move on the growth and
competitiveness agenda (CEM) and to increase pro-poor expenditures (PER), the lending program
became exclusively concerned with improving social indicators and services. The power project,
which the CAS envisaged as a means to help Djibouti restructure i t s loss making utility, was
eventually designed as an instrument to extend services to the poor. N o real effort was made to
address the basic problems o f the bankrupt utility, however. In addition, the proposed IDA partial
risk guarantee to support a concession scheme for the Djibouti-Ethiopia railway could not be
activated because o f the complexity o f finding appropriate solutions in a regional context. In the
education sector, the second phase o f the APL was prepared before the PER was issued.
Accordingly, it did not benefit from the analysis o f public expenditure issues in the education
sector. It was clear, however, that expansion o f the system was fiscally unsustainable. It would have
been highly advisable to reach agreement with the Government on a medium-term expenditure
program for the sector.

30. The performance o f the Bank i s rated as moderately satisfactory. The analytical work
was good. As discussed above, in designing i t s operations, particularly in the power and education
sector, the Bank did not try with sufficient vigor to reach agreement with the Government on cost
reduction and sustainability, however. Portfolio management was fully adequate.
Portfolio Assessment

3 1. Overall implementationo f the portfolio during the CAS period has been satisfactory (6
projects) with only one problem project during FY08, the second school access and improvement
project, with flags in monitoring and evaluation, and disbursement. However, all projects start with

39

two flags, the country record and country environment flags2 which are automatically raised for all
projects in Djibouti. Disbursement ratio for the entire portfolio has been stable over the CAS
period, with a ratio higher than 33 percent.

32.

A Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) carried out in June 2008 noted that
supervision o f the portfolio was focused on results, but was hampered in i t s efforts by the limited
capacity for M&E in Djibouti. Issues were brought to the attention o f management and addressed
expeditiously. The safeguards and fiduciary aspects were adequately monitored. Bank teams
provided strong support to project implementation units, particularly as concerns procurement and
financial management issues.

IEG Evaluation of IC&. During the CAS period the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG)
evaluated three implementation completion reports (ICRs) for the Djibouti Social Development and
Public Works, the International Road Corridor Project, and the first phase o f the Education APL.
The I C R for the Social Development and Public Works received a moderately satisfactory rating on
outcome. For lessons learned, IEG stated that there i s a need to prepare projects with realistic
targets and timetables, with associated risks flagged up front. Implementation in clear phases would
facilitate results at a reasonable pace while consolidating support for the project. Project preparation
should be thorough, but envisage a flexible project design to adapt to the development pace o f the
country, and in this case the evolution o f the executing agency. Close support and intense
supervision i s required for projects in countries with low implementation capacity to ensure that
problems are identified early on and that solutions are put in place and followed up.”

33.

34. The I C R for the first phase o f the Education A P L was issued in December 2005. It was
reviewed by IEG in February 2006. IEG concurred with the ICR’s ratings (satisfactory for outcome,
substantial for institutional development and highly likely for sustainability). K e y lessons from
experience are: broad consultation i s essential in ensuring success, A P L i s a good instrument for
To date, the flag for the country environment records risk remains permanently raised in the portfolio
management system, because the CPIA rating has been historically low, and, despite recent economic
management improvement, the rating remains below 3.5. Similarly, the country record flag remains raised,
following a net disconnect of 20 percent between the outcome IEG rating and the ISR rating for projects
evaluated between FY2002 and FY2006.

long-term commitment, and Bank supervision needs t o pay more attention to monitoring and
evaluation.

35. For the International Road Corridor project, which financed the rehabilitation o f the road and
associated service infrastructure from the port to the Ethiopian border, IEG concluded that the
project achieved i t s objectives, and the outcome was rated satisfactory. Travel time from the port t o
the border has been reduced from between 6 to 10 hours to less than three hours and transport cost
have been reduced by 60 percent. Traffic increased faster than expected. The internal rate o f return
at 42 percent was higher than estimated at appraisal. IEG also reviewed the I C R for a Global
Environment Fund (GEF) grant for the financing o f a regional project to improve coastal and
marine environments o f the Red Sea and G o l f o f Aden. The outcome o f the project was rated as
satisfactory.
Cost of CAS implementation

36. Average project preparation costs, excluding additional financing, in the CAS period were
relatively low (at US$240,000 / US$283,000 when PHRD grants are included). In comparison, the
average preparation costs excluding additional financing were US$472,000 (US$5 57,000 when
PHRD are included) in Yemen over the same period (FY05-08). However, it will be noted that the
preparation cost amounts to US$306,000 in FY08. This amount i s s t i l l the lowest for the region.
For the ESW, the average completion cost was US$89,000 over FY05-08, and was below the
regional average (US$l25,000) for FY06.

Country Dialogue and Aid Coordination

37. The country dialogue was adequate. The Government was helpful in addressing project
implementation issues as they arose. It was less inclined to take appropriate measures to reduce
costs in the provision o f public services. The issues raised in the C E M and PER should have been
brought to the fore more forcefully, but this was not an easy task, as the Djiboutian authorities did
not feel the urge to introduce difficult reforms during a period marked by a fast increase in the flow
o f private investment. During the CAS period foreign direct investment dwarfed IDA
disbursements.
38. The Bank worked effectively with its development partners. The donor community i s
particularly small in Djibouti, and the Bank does not have an office there. Close coordination with

41

donors was maintained by Bank missions during the CAS period, however. As mentioned above,
the Bank was able to develop a multi-donor program for urban poverty reduction with the African
Development Bank and the Islamic Development Bank. The three institutions have operated within
a common framework and coordinated with a new project financed by the Agence FranCaise pour
le De'veloppement (AFD) in the same domain, each however establishing a separate and parallel cofinancing agreement with the Government. In total, the Bank US$3 million were substantially
leveraged to a total o f $38.5 million that i s helping cover infrastructure needs in the poorest
neighborhoods o f Djibouti-ville and in five secondary centers.

Lessons learned

39. Managing tensions among different ethnic groups and between local population and a large
number o f immigrants from unstable neighboring countries involves a delicate balancing act. After
the lost decade o f the 1990s due to civil strife and deepening poverty, the Government has been
able to restore political stability and economic growth. Progress was made also in improving social
indicators. This i s a major achievement. It i s important now for the Government to build up on
success achieved to address key issues, which may stand in the way o f sustained economic growth
and poverty reduction.

40. The Bank assistance program helped Djibouti make rapid progress on social indicators, but
had little influence on the growth and governance agenda. Building upon success achieved, it i s
important now to consolidate results and help Djibouti achieve i t s vision o f a service hub in
between the Arab world and the Eastern Africa Region. The vulnerabilities exposed during the food
and o i l crises o f 2008 should serve as a basis for deepening the policy dialogue between Djibouti
and the Bank.

41. Consultations with the Government for the preparation o f the new CAS should be centered
on how to improve competitiveness and ensure that improvements in the provision o f social
services are sustainable. The new CAS should be highly selective and focus on enhancing
competitiveness and improving the provision o f basic services in a sustainable way.
