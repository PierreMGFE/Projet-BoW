EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

i.
Mauritius is a development success story. At independence in 1968, the country was
poor, with a nominal per capita of about US$260. Today, nominal income per capita is
US$3,800. Mauritius has turned its ethnic diversity into a major economic asset. The country has
taken judicious advantage of business links throughout the world and preferential access to key
markets. Fueled by booming exports, Mauritius became a middle-income country. It has a stable
government, a reliable and independent judiciary, and well performing public institutions.
However, there remain pockets of poverty. Selected groups have not fully benefited from
Mauritius' strong growth. But the nature and depth of poverty in Mauritius is distinctly less
severe than the poverty levels observed in neighboring African countries. As most of the poor
have access to key social services, the issue in Mauritius is more one of social exclusion than of
abject poverty.
ii.
The last Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was presented to the Board in 1997 (R97-55,
dated April 22, 1997). Since then, Mauritius' economic and social performance has continued to
be among the most impressive in the developing world. Today, the main pillars of the Mauritian
economy are sugar, higher-end textile production and up-scale tourism. The Mauritian
authorities are fully aware that preferential market access will come to an end and the existing
economic base will increasingly be subject to stiffer competition. In response, the Government
has embarked on an ambitious economic program, the New Economic Agenda (NEA), also
referred to as the Economic Agenda for the New Millennium.
iii.
The NEA is expected to advance Mauritius to the next phase of development. Its three
key objectives are to: (i) increase Mauritius' competitiveness; (ii) bring about deeper social
development and social cohesion; and (iii) preserve and protect Mauritius' fragile environment.
The NEA is expected to further diversify the Mauritian economy into a high-skill services sector
endowed with an efficient public sector delivering quality services, and a modem infrastructure
consisting of new public transport systems and state-of-the-art inforrnation technology. The NEA
is also expected to provide more opportunities for those who have not fully benefited from the
country's past economic performance as well as those selected groups who may be negatively
affected by the transformation of the economy. The NEA also provides mechanisms for ensuring
that growth remains sustainable and does not negatively affect Mauritius' fragile natural
environment.
iv.
The most important requirement for the success of the NEA is the expansion of education
with a major increase in its quality. Education is the one area where Mauritius' success does not
measure up to the performance of countries with similar levels of per capita income. Too many
children, especially from poorer families, drop out of school; the quality of schools, the great
majority of which are publicly financed, greatly varies and tends to be biased towards the better
off. Many skills taught at technical schools are of little relevance to the demands of today's labor
market. Mauritius continues to rely on expatriate workers. At the same time, unemployment is
increasing, especially among school leavers. Other development areas that deserve greater focus
include: (i) social programs and their effectiveness; (ii) environmental issues, including the
development of new modes of transport; and (iii) public resource management and the
management of contingent liabilities.

v.
The Government of Mauritius is fully aware of the challenges that it faces in the
implementation of the NEA. It has asked for increased Bank support with changes in the levels
and composition of Bank assistance. In response to the Govermment's request, the Bank has
developed this CAS. It puts greater emphasis on Economic and Sector Work (ESW) that is
tightly linked to the Government's NEA. The ESW will be carried out jointly by a variety of
Mauritian institutions, other donors and the Bank, under all CAS scenarios. The Bank lending
operations under this CAS would consist of PERLs and are designed to fully support the NEA.
The timing of these lending operations will coincide with Mauritius' budget cycle so that
proceeds of World Bank loans are available at the beginning of Mauritius' fiscal year. All
project-specific investment lending will be phased out. The base case of the CAS consists of
financial assistance totaling up to US$80 million for FY02-04. In the high case, the Bank could
lend up to US$120 million for FY02-04. In the low case scenario, Bank assistance will be
restricted to one operation of US$40 million to support the NEA. The success in implementing
policies to support the NEA will determine the volume of the Bank's financial support during the
FY02-04 period. These NEA policies have already been identified by the Government and are
described in the policy matrix attached to this CAS.
vi.
The strategy faces three risks: i) key NEA policy reforms may fall short; (ii) reform
implementation delays occur and efforts fail to bring the education system up to international
levels; and (iii) there is insufficient fiscal adjustment. The CAS describes the Bank's response if
any of these risks materialize.
vii.

The following issues are suggested for Board discussion:
* Does the Board consider that the Bank's strategy adequately addresses the development
issues facing Mauritius ?
*

Does the Board consider the proposed instruments, the emphasis on ESW, and the shift to
PERLs to support Government's NEA appropriate ?

MEMORANDUM OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY OF THE WORLD BANK GROUP
FOR THE REPUBLIC OF MAURITIUS
"It is going to be a great achievement if Mauritius can find productive employment for its
population without a serious reduction in the existing standard of living.... The outlook for
peaceful development is poor. " 1
James Meade, Nobel Prize Winner, 1961
I. BACKGROUND
1.
James Meade turned out to be mistaken. Contrary to the predictions of the eminent Nobel
Prize winner, Mauritius became a development success story. Since independence in 1968,
Mauritius has been among the few African countries that have moved decisively to the next stage
of development. Between 1970 and 2000, the annual income of the average Mauritian increased
tenfold in nominal terms, from US$260 to US$3,800, as the economy successfully diversified
away from sugar and into manufacturing and services.
What Drove the Diversification of Mauritius' Economy?
2.
The early 1970s were characterized by bumper sugar harvests. In 1975, cyclone Gervaise
slashed sugar production by 30 percent, but the economy quickly recovered. However, in the
1980s, fundamental disequilibria in the economy became apparent. Cyclone Claudette
exacerbated the underlying weaknesses in the economy, and GDP in 1980 fell by a record 10
percent. To lessen its vulnerability to such shocks, Mauritius started to diversify its economy
Annual GDP growth rates well above five percent became the norm. This growth was
spearheaded by production in the export processing zones (EPZ), a competitive exchange rate
and by savings and investment rates exceeding 20 percent of GDP. Today Mauritius' GDP per
capita is the second highest in Africa. Mauritius' vulnerability to economic shocks has decreased
considerably over the past two decades. Agriculture, which accounted for 23 percent of GDP in
1970, now accounts for only 6 percent, while manufacturing has jumped from 15 to 24 percent of
GDP over the same period.
An Early Realization of the Importance of Exports
3.
Mauritius was the first African country to create EPZs. Unlike later investors in other
African EPZs, most investors in Mauritius' EPZs were nationals. Those Mauritian entrepreneurs,
whose ancestors came from India, France, China and other countries, took advantage of links
with their countries of origin. Exceptional export performance propelled Mauritius to higher
standards of living. On a per capita basis, Mauritius' manufactured exports are more than one
hundred and fifty times that of the average Sub-Saharan African country. Today, Mauritian
exports exceed US$1 billion in industrial and processed products; the median African country
'Meade J.E., and others (1961), "The Economic and Social Structure of Mauritius".

3

exports about US$28 million of similar goods. Mauritian investors have also become important
players in the development of lower end textile production at low labor cost in neighboring
countries.
4.
Throughout the years, Mauritian policymakers have paid special attention to exchange
rate developments, striking a balance between maintaining international competitiveness while
avoiding major shocks and maintaining the type of stability that is valued by international
investors. At the end of January 2002, net international reserves amounted to about seven months
of imports.
Creditworthiness:Among the Best Developing Countries
5.
Mauritius' creditworthiness is underpinned by its strong economic performance over the
last two decades. External and internal debt is at manageable levels. In the World Bank's debt
reporting system, Mauritius is classified as a moderately indebted middle-income country, along
with countries such as Chile, Malaysia, Tunisia, and Uruguay. Mauritius' long-term government
bonds denominated in foreign currency carry a Moody's rating of Baa2, the same as Korea and
Malaysia. Long-term bonds denominated in domestic currency are rated A2, comparable to the
rating for Greece and Poland. Mauritius was one of the few developing countries whose rating
was not revised downward in the wake of the September 11 events.
6.
Total external debt outstanding is currently about US$1.8 billion or about 39 percent of
GDP. Total external debt service payments amount to 7.3 percent of exports of goods and
services. Central Government's external debt represents less than 25 percent of total external
debt. The domestic debt of the central Government represents about 44 percent of GDP. Overall,
and compared with other developing countries, the existing debt of the Mauritian government is
moderate.
Poverty Declined
7.
Since independence, poverty in Mauzitius has dramatically declined. In 1968, most of the
population lived on less than US$1 a day. Today, virtually no Mauritian does. The most recent
poverty line that was used for policy purposes was set at a level well above US$1 a day and was
defined at a monthly income of less than Rs2,228 per adult- about US$116 in real terms or
US$328 in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms (see Box 1). The latest household budget survey
(HBS) of 1996/97 shows that 9.4 percent of adults then lived under this poverty line of Rs2,228
per adult. The GINI coefficient, a common measure of income inequality, 2 has declined from 0.5
in 1962 to 0.42 in 1975, and to 0.39 in 1996/97. However, between 1991/92 and 1996/97,
income equality deteriorated slightly, although the change is not statistically significant.
Nevertheless, the authorities are keenly aware of the potential for social exclusion caused by
deteriorating income distribution. New household data are expected to be available in the fall of
2002, upon completion of the 2001/02 HBS survey.
8.
The quality of Mauritian life has increased across the board; 84 percent of households
have piped water and 99 percent have access to electricity. Improvements in health and
2

GINI= 0 means that everyone has the same income; GINI = 1 means that all income accrues to one person.

4

education indicators are equally impressive. Life expectancy at birth increased from 63 in 1970
to 71 years in 2000. Infant mortality dropped from 64 per 1,000 live births in 1970 to 17 in 1999.
Mauritius is proud of its fairly generous welfare system, which has contributed to maintaining
social cohesion within an ethnically and religiously diverse population.
Box 1. Poverty in Mauritius
Mauritius does not have an official and uniform poverty line, so time trends in poverty are hard to
construct. For practical purposes, the authorities use a poverty line which is set at 50 percent of the
median monthly per capita income The latest Household Budget Survey (HBS) was carried out in
1996/97. A 2001/02 HBS is underway and results are expected in November 2002. Although the
quality of the data is good, their use in designing antipoverty policies is limited. The Government has
asked the Bank for technical assistance in building local capacity to undertake poverty diagnostic
work.
According to the 1996/97 HBS, the median monthly income per adult was Rs4,456 (about US$233 per
month, or US$657 adjusted for PPP). About 9.4 percent of the adult population lives on half this sum
or less, and is considered poor. The additional monthly income the average poor adult would have to
earn was estimated at Rs49 (i.e., an estimated poverty gap of 2.2 percent). Thus the depth of poverty
in Mauritius is relatively low: a total transfer of about 0.9 percent of GDP would be required to lift
every adult in Mauritius out of poverty.
The island of Rodrigues is clearly the poorest region of Mauritius with 37.6 percent of the adult
population considered as poor. Other poor regions include Pamplemousses and Flacq where,
respectively, 10.3 percent and 10.4 percent of the adults live on a monthly income of less than
Rs2,228. The differences in poverty rates across regions suggest that there is scope for geographical
targeting to reach the poor.
Poor families typically have a larger than average family size. School drop-out and repeater rates are
also significantly higher for children from poorer families. The incidence of poverty among singleheaded households is four times higher than the national average. Virtually all of these single parent
households are headed by females, mostly unwed, abandoned, or divorced mothers. These poor
households face significant risks of social exclusion.
Women are Playing A Greater Role
9.
Mauritius has made major progress in enhancing the status of women. A sizable gender
gap in young adult literacy in 1970 has been eliminated. Secondary school and tertiary
enrollment rates are now the same for women as for men. Female labor participation was about
38 percent in 1999. Female representation in the National Legislative Assembly has increased
from zero in 1976 to 10 percent now (6 out of 62 parliamentarians). Similar trends can be
observed in female representation in municipal and village councils.
Awareness of the Importance of Governance
10.
Mauritian policymakers are keenly aware of the importance of good governance. In June
2000, the Economic Crime and Anti-Money Laundering Act was passed. An independent
commission against corruption will be established this year, headed by a judge or an individual
5

with the qualifications to hold office as a judge of a supreme court. On governance, the
Government aspires to be at par with OECD countries and the best performing East Asian
countries. The Government has contracted high quality consultants with broad experience to
assist in the promotion of good governance and the fight against corruption. It has also published
a code of good conduct for civil servants addressing issues such as conflict of interest and
potential abuse of power.
Transparency of Decision Making
11.
On the whole, the internal policymaking process is transparent. The press is free and
provides ample space for opposing views. Radio and TV ownership is being diversified.
Decisions made at weekly cabinet meetings and important information reports, including IMF
and World Bank reports, are published on Government websites.
12. There are several fora for discussion and debate with civil society, trade unions, and
employers' federations. These fora include the Mauritius Council of Social Services grouping
Mauritius' most relevant NGOs, the National Trade Unions Confederation, the Federation of
Civil Service Unions, the Joint Economic Council, the Mauritius' Employers' Federation, the
Tripartite Committee on Wage Negotiation, and the newly formed National Economic and Social
Council. The reconstruction in the aftermath of the January 2002 cyclone Dina and the
restoration of key services illustrate the ability of different parts of Mauritian society to work
together and show a sense of national purpose and unity. At the same time, freedom of speech,
the diversity of ownership within the media, a history of religious freedom, and the peaceful
coexistence of groups of very different ethnic backgrounds, education, and religions, are
indications of the depth of Mauritius' democratic foundations.
Economic Developments since the 1997 CAS
13.
Since the last CAS-presented to the Board in April 1997-Mauritius has maintained its
strong economic performance.. GDP growth has remained high, averaging more than 5.4 percent
per year between 1996 and 2000. In FY99/003 , sugar production was seriously affected by a
drought and GDP fell to 2.6 percent. GDP recovered in FYOO/0l: real GDP growth amounted to
7.2 percent, with all sectors recording positive growth. The inflation rate for FYOO/01 decreased
to 4.4 percent-below the target of 5 to 5.5 percent. Exports to the U.S. increased dramatically
prior to the September 11 events as a result of the African Growth and Opportunity Act 2000
(AGOA). The Act offers tangible incentives for African countries to continue their efforts to
open their economies and build free markets.
14. Between 1997 and 2000, personal incomes increased at a pace well above regional
averages. With an average annual population growth rate of 1.2 percent, and in the absence of
major changes in income distribution, poverty declined rapidly. In the year 2000, Mauritius per
capita income of US$ 3,800 was the second highest in Africa. In PPP terms, it was US$9,940 a
level comparable with the richer Latin American countries.

3

The fiscal year starts on July 1. FYOO/0 1 thus covers the period July 1, 2000 through June 30, 2001.

6

15.
External shocks have affected growth for the FY01/02 fiscal year. Since September 11,
export growth to the United States fell and foreign direct investment declined. Furthermore, even
though Mauritius was spared the collapse in tourism experienced elsewhere following the
September 11 event, the sharp increase in the number of tourists, occurring in the first half of
2001, came to an end. In January 2002, Mauritius was hit by Dina, the most severe cyclone
(category 4) in five years causing significant damage.
16.
Considering these shocks, Mauritius' economy is proving to be remarkably resilient: the
economy is projected to grow by about 5.3 percent in real terns in FY01/02. For FY02/03, real
GDP is projected to grow by about 4.6 percent in spite of a reduction in sugar production as a
result of cyclone Dina. Inflation however is expected to edge upward as a result of an increase in
food prices. The budgetary fiscal deficit is expected to remain at about 6.5 percent of GDP for
FY01/02.

Mauritius' Progress in Meeting the Millennium Development Goals
17.
Mauritius is among the few countries in Africa that has either met, or is highly likely to
meet all but one of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by the year 2015. Virtually no
one in Mauritius suffers from hunger or lives on less than US$1 a day. The overwhelming
majority of the population has access to safe drinking water. Primary education is universal. One
MDG that Mauritius is unlikely to meet is the reduction by two-thirds of the child mortality rate
(IMR). Mauritius' IMR stands currently at 17 deaths per 1,000 live births. This is below the IMR
in most middle income countries. Bringing the 1IMR down from 17 to 6 (below the level the USA
has today) is considered unlikely given Mauritius' level of income especially in the various
pockets of poverty in selected areas of Mauritius. On the whole, Mauritius' development
challenges go well beyond the reaching of the MDGs and focuses on success fully guiding
Mauritius to the next level of development.

Explaining Mauritius' Economic Performance
18.
Between independence and 1990, Mauritius' economic growth was primarily driven by
the accumulation of inputs: the use of more labor and more capital led to higher production. In
the 1990s, however, growth was driven by strong increases in 4 productivity: total factor
productivity (TFP) increased by an average of 1.4 percent per year, and compared favorably
even with increases in TFP of East Asian countries such as Korea and Malaysia.
19.
Mauritius has not always followed orthodox economic policies. While exports clearly
played the major role in the "Mauritian miracle", views differ on the effectiveness of
Government interventions in key markets, such as that for essential commodities and the labor
market. In the EPZs, exporting firms were able to import inputs duty free and benefited from a
variety of tax incentives. However, overall trade practices remained fairly restrictive, 5 and only
recently have trade policies become more liberal. On balance, however, the Government was
able to manage the effects of the economic incentives. The labor market for the export sector was

resources, etc.

effectively segmented from the rest of the economy, and exporting firms were able to flexibly
expand or reduce the labor force in response to changing market conditions.
20.
A key factor in explaining Mauritius' success seems to be its judicious use of preferential
trade agreements; most notably, the country has taken advantage of guaranteed sugar exports to
the European Union and preferential access to consumer markets for exports of textiles and
clothing under the Multifiber Agreement (MFA). Rents accruing to Mauritius as a result of these
preferential trade agreements are estimated to be about 4.5 percent of GDP in the 1990s. The
very fact that Mauritius was, and still is, able to take advantage of these opportunities points to
the strength of its institutions. Government, entrepreneurs, and workers worked together, and
differences were not used as sources of division but as opportunities to develop national welfare.
Outlook and the Emergence of New Challenges and Risks
21.
Overall economic prospects remain good and the immediate economic impact of
September 11 seems to be less severe than originally envisaged. The Government is keenly
aware of the challenges and is taking steps to position the country for entry into its next phase of
development
Challenges
22.
First, the diversification of the country's economic base needs to be further expanded.
Mauritius is a small open country, vulnerable to developments beyond its control. The
remarkable performance in sugar and textiles was based not just on sheer entrepreneurial
competence but also on stable and predictable revenues coming from preferential access to the
European and U.S. markets. However, preferential trade agreements and the resulting
possibilities to indirectly subsidize exporters are gradually being phased out under new WTO
rules. This loss in preferential treatment will be offset by easier market access for Mauritian
exporters, alongside other exporting African countries, under the recently approved AGOA. As a
result of AGOA, trade with the U.S. during the first six months of 2001 was 24 percent higher
than in the first half of 2000. However, this initial spurt of exports emanated from new buyers in
the U.S, and following the September 11 events, orders from new buyers dropped by 50 percent
as they preferred to rely on established lines of supply. Orders remained normal from existing
U.S. buyers already doing business with Mauritius before AGOA. In the medium- to long-run,
Mauritian textile producers will face intensified competition from new low-cost labor garment
producers such as Madagascar (which also benefits greatly from AGOA), China, Vietnam,
Bangladesh, and other Asian countries.
23.
Moreover, the tourism sector could be sensitive to an economic downturn in Europe. So
far, the sector has responded remarkably well to the September 11 events. Tourism capacity is
still being expanded in Mauritius, and further growth is still envisaged. In the long run however,
tourism will face saturation and capacity constraints given the size of the island and its
environmental fragility. Mauritius thus needs to encourage new growth sectors that can move the
country toward its next phase of development.
24.
Second, human capital needs substantial improvement. The prevailing vision among
policymakers in Mauritius is to create a deeply democratic society anchored in a knowledge9

based economy similar to that of Singapore. However, such a strategy crucially depends on
human capital and the quality of the labor force. Mauritius' current labor force is ill-equipped to
match the labor force of knowledge-based societies. On average, a Mauritian worker has had
seven years of education compared to more than ten years for the average worker in Singapore
and nine years in countries, such as China and Korea. Thus the education system has not been
able to keep pace with the requirements of the country's fast growing economy.
25.
In terms of the quality of education, Mauritius also falls short compared to Singapore. A
1999 international student achievement test showed that Singaporean students top the list of 38
participating countries (mainly high-income) for mean achievement scores in mathematics, and
were second (after Taiwan) in science. 6 Mauritius, on the other hand, has not yet participated in
these international student achievement tests, and it is likely that achievement outcomes in
Mauritius will show important gaps compared to countries with similar levels of income.
26.
Moreover, about one third of children, mainly from poorer families, do not make it
beyond the primary level. In some of the poorer regions such as the Black River District and the
island of Rodrigues, the primary school pass rates are as low as 38 percent and 54 percent
respectively. Children from poorer families do not get the academic assistance and the tutoring
required to complete schooling. Unless addressed over a prolonged period of time, the existing
system will contribute to the creation of a class of citizens who are ill-equipped for the 21St
century and run a considerable risk of being unemployed or socially excluded.
27.
Public spending on education in Mauritius increased during the last decade, from about
3 percent of GDP in 1991 to about 4 percent in 1999. However, it remains relatively modest
compared with other upper-middle-income countries where total spending on education (public
and private combined) typically amounts to about 8 percent of GDP. Although education is
nominally free, Mauritians spend a substantial share of their income on private tutoring, which
has become an additional revenue source for teachers. More than 50 percent of Mauritian
households reported monthly expenditures on private tutoring.
28.
Third, Government's public finances need to be restructured. The NEA and Mauritius'
vision of moving to the next phase of development entails ambitious plans and large public
investments. The low level of tax revenues combined with increased levels of public spending is
putting pressure on the budget and presents the authorities with difficult choices. Tension is
increasing between, on the one hand, low taxation to encourage private investment, and on the
other, the large public investments planned by the Government. The result is a budgetary deficit
currently around 6.5 percent, as noted above.
29.
At the same time, Mauritius still has a large public enterprises sector that rely on financial
support from the Government. Some-most notably the State Trading Corporation (STC) and
the Central Electricity Board (CEB)-have large debts and had large operating deficits in 2001
when international oil prices were high and domestic prices were not adjusted. The Government
is undertaking a comprehensive overview of its contingent liabilities linked to the Public
Enterprises Sector. Even though oil prices have been brought in line with international prices and
the deficits of CEB and STC have been reduced, it is possible that this review of contingent

10

liabilities will lead to an increase in public debt. To meet the goal of reducing its central
government budget deficit by about one percentage point of GDP per year and bringing it down
to about 3 percent of GDP by FY05/06, the Govemment will need to manage its fiscal policies
carefully by phasing public investments and by taking additional revenue measures.
30.
Government's debt levels are manageable in spite of relatively high fiscal deficit of about
6.5 percent of GDP. With the measures that Government is taking and the expected reduction of
the fiscal deficit, debt levels are expected to remain manageable in the foreseeable future. The
Memorandum of the President on the proposed PERL (Report No. P-7518-MAS) accompanying
this CAS, contains a description of Government's debt strategy under different scenarios . Given
the current macroeconomic outlook, the expenditure and revenue measures currently being
undertaken by Government, central government debt is expected to peak at about 53.7 percent of
GDP in FY03/04 and to decline thereafter. Similarly, central government debt service as a share
of government revenues will increase slightly to about 23 percent by FY04/05, and decline
thereafter. Thus, the implementation of NEA is expected to result in only a temporary increase in
indebtedness. In the event though of low GDP growth rates or disappointing levels of tax
revenues, a further restructuring of public finances will be required. The sensitivity analysis
contained in the proposed PERL illustrates the viability of Government's debt strategy under the
different scenarios but the analysis highlights the need for close monitoring of fiscal policies.
31.
Fourth, social exclusion and poverty remain on the policy agenda, and unemployment is
on the rise. Persistent pockets of poverty continue to exist, especially in Rodrigues, where
income levels and social indicators are below those on the main island. There are also large
important geographical differences in poverty. The existing welfare system is generous but falls
short in protecting the most vulnerable segments of the population and preventing social
exclusion.
32.
Between 1996 and 2000, employment increased by only 10,900 jobs in large enterprises
and by 21,000 jobs in small- and medium-scale enterprises. This increase in employment is
lower than the new demand for jobs; thus, unemployment is rising. At the same time, Mauritius
employs 15,000 expatriate workers (about 3 percent of the total labor force) mainly in the EPZs.
The majority of EPZ workers are women. Migrant EPZ workers are mainly from China, India,
and Sri Lanka. They work long hours and live in quarters provided by their employers. The
minimum wage for women was 30 percent below that of men when EPZs were created in the
1970s, EPZ wages were equalized in the early 1980s. Today, the overall unemployment rate
among women is slightly higher than that for men. In spite of recent progress, only a quarter of
managerial posts are occupied by women.
II. THE GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMIC AGENDA FOR THE
NEW MILLENNIUM (NEA)
33.
Following elections in September 2000, the labor Government that ruled the country
since 1997 was replaced by an alliance of the Mouvement Socialiste Militant (MSM) and the
Mouvement Militant Mauricien (MMM). On February 15, 2002, the president of Mauritius,
Mr. Cassam Uteem, resigned from his post. Mr. Karl Offman was elected by the Mauritius
National Assembly on February 25 to fill the post of president. As part of the agreement between
11

MSM and MMM, the current prime minister, Sir Anerood Jugnauth (leader of the MSM), will
become president within 18 months and will be replaced as Prime minister by Mr. Paul
Berenger, the leader of the MMM.
34.
As soon as the MSM-MMM Government came to power in September 2000, it undertook
an analysis of the challenges facing the Mauritian economy and formulated an Economic Agenda
for the New Millennium (NEA). The NEA aims to transform Mauritius into a high-tech, highincome service and knowledge economy and its key objectives are:
A. Increasing competitiveness and productivity to maintain and increase the high rates of
growth, thus reducing poverty and increasing incomes and social well-being;
B. Bringing about deeper social development and social cohesion through (i) higher
quality education and more equitable access; (ii) social assistance that reaches the poor
more efficiently and is financially sustainable; and (iii) improved and financially
sustainable healthcare; and
C. Preserving and protecting Mauritius'fragile environment to ensure that higher growth
is enviromnentally sustainable.
35.
Substantial progress has been made thus far in the implementation of many policy actions
designed to achieve these objectives. The budget was also realigned to meet strategic priorities,
with expenditures being focused on education, environment, infrastructure, and poverty.
Competitiveness and Productivity
36.
Faced with the need to diversify its economy in order to maintain strong economic
growth, Mauritius has undertaken several concrete actions. The Sugar Industry Efficiency Act
was passed in 2001. Implementation of the Sugar Sector Strategic Plan embodied in the Act was
also started in the same year. In addition to reducing the production costs in the sugar sector, the
Government is promoting a voluntary retirement scheme for sugar-related companies. Around
6,000 to 8,000 workers in the sector-20 to 25 percent of the workforce-will take early
retirement.
37.
The textile sector has been until now one of the country's key sectors under the
preferential trade agreement with the European Union. This will come to an end by December
2004, and an action plan to guide the necessary transition of the sector has been completed. On
tourism, the Government has produced a tourism development plan with a twenty-year vision
and a five-year action program to create the necessary regulatory and institutional framework for
tourism development.
38.
To support the move to a more service based economy, the regulatory framework for the
information and communications technology (ICT) and financial sectors has been overhauled.
The Government is actively seeking foreign investments in the ICT sector by developing a
package of incentives and through the creation of a Cyber City that is expected to be completed
by September 2003. In addition, the Government is actively encouraging international companies

12

to relocate their regional headquarters in Mauritius. Reforms in the financial sector have
accelerated under the Financial Services Development Act 2001, which creates a nonbanking
financial sector regulator covering insurance, the stock market, and pensions. This body, the
Financial Services Commission, is responsible for overseeing all nonbanking financial bodies
and promoting efficiency and transparency and is now operational. In addition, this new
institutional and regulatory framework will harmonize the offshore and onshore sectors,
introduce coherent supervisory standards and promote good governance and investors'
confidence.
39.
To further enhance efficiency and reduce rates for international connectivity,
Government plans to fully liberalize its telecommunication sector by 2003. After considerable
delay, Mauritius' privatization plans got off the ground with the sale of shares for Mauritius
Telecom in November 2000. Radio and TV broadcasting services are also being liberalized.
Strategic partners are being sought for other related public utility enterprises such as the
electricity company.
Social Development and Cohesion
40. The Government is focusing on reforms in four areas critical to promoting social
development and cohesion: (i) education and training; (ii) poverty; (iii) social programs; and
(iv) health.
Education and training
41.
Education is critical not only to support a highly skilled labor force but also as one of the
prime instruments in preventing social exclusion and reducing poverty. Mauritius has been
successful in reaching universal primary education. However, 35 percent of students fail the
primary education completion exam, and at the secondary and tertiary levels, the net enrolment
ratios are significantly lower than required for economic growth. The Government's focus is on
improved quality, efficiency, and equity of access in education and training. An ambitious
reform of the education and training system is being undertaken, including (i) increasing the
number of years of compulsory schooling from six to eleven, (ii) improving equity and cost
efficiency and increasing access at primary and secondary levels, (iii) introducing ICT in primary
and secondary schools, and (iv) improving the quality and relevance of the curricula and
restructuring the examination system. This reform will better enable the Mauritian economy to
adapt to global competition and participate in the e-economy.
42.
Increased public spending on education and training and more private sector involvement
and financing is necessary to implement this ambitious agenda. Government spending on
education amounts to about 4 percent of GDP, which Government realizes is insufficient to
achieve its desired goals. Thus in FY01/02, capital expenditure on education and training
increased by 58 percent. Around Rsl.1 billion (US$36 million) was allocated for FY01/02 for
construction of new secondary schools and a similar amount is planned for FY02/03. School
intake capacity in Rodrigues is expected to double. The Govermnent is aware that the upgrading
of its education system will require sustained effort and increased levels of spending for about

13

five to eight years. Skills will also need to be upgraded to face the challenges of a modem labor
market.
Poverty
43.
The Government is giving top priority to the poverty reduction through the
implementation of the National Action Plan for Poverty Alleviation by a partnership of the
public and private sectors with civil society. In addition, significantly greater public
investment-over one billion rupees in FYO1/02-is being allocated to the island of Rodrigues,
where the poverty head count index is well above the national average. The Government is also
extending existing micro finance schemes to target community development and diversify the
areas of intervention. Lastly, it is undertaking a series of housing improvements for the poorest
segments of the population.
Social programs
44.
Govermment has an array of social assistance programs in place, including flour and rice
subsidies, income support for individuals with special needs, and housing assistance. However,
all these programs need to be more efficiently targeted to the poor. The Government thus plans
to move away from broad categories of social assistance and its beneficiaries and provide
opportunities focused on those of the poor who meet specific qualifications. Mauritius also plans
to modernize its current pension system to ensure its financial viability and equitable
distribution. The goal is to provide adequate care for the poor while offering the better off
opportunities to make voluntary provision for themselves. A comprehensive analysis of the
options for reform has been completed, and a national white paper is under preparation for
national debate.
Health
45.
Mauritius also plans to modernize the provision and financing of health services;
currently it is under great pressure from the demands of a rapidly aging population and the
growing burden of noncommunicable diseases, in particular cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
The Government has commissioned a study on the use of an insurance scheme to finance
incremental high-cost tertiary services while maintaining free basic services. The report is
currently being examined.
The Environment
46. The Government's agenda for the preservation of the environment focuses on solid and
liquid waste management and transport. Government has added Rs600 million (US$19 million)
to its budget to accelerate the installation of sewerage projects or. the island. An additional
40,000 households are expected to be connected to the sewerage network in the coming years.
Government also plans to commission a waste-to-energy incinerator of a capacity of about
150,000 tons/year on a Build-Own-Operate basis. Tenders for the project will be launched this
year. In addition, Government is exploring the possibility of further extending the existing
landfill or establishing a new landfill at an alternative site.

14

47. Government has been seeking an alternative mode of transportation along the Port LouisCurepipe corridor to reduce significantly both congestion and levels of pollution. The most likely
option is a light rail transport system. Further, unleaded petroleum will be introduced as soon as
possible, customs duties on all chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) and ozone-depleting cylinders have
been raised by 40 percent, and duty on ozone-friendly cylinders has been abolished. A national
council is also being created to promote the use of renewable energy and study the feasibility of
windmills.
48. Finally, Government is currently implementing the National Environment Action Plan 2
(NEAP 2). Investments in the areas of biodiversity and coastal zone management as well as land
conservation and management will be made. To improve environmental management, training
and technical assistance will be provided to strengthen policy planning and build institutional
capacity. Training will include environmental impact assessment review and the licensing and
monitoring of mitigation plans.
Economic Management
49. The key to achieving the three objectives of the NEA is sound economic management.
Government recognizes the need to move to multiyear budgeting and introduce clearer links
between development objectives and the budgetary process. The Government has embarked on
reforms aimed at introducing a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) as a first step. The
goal will be to facilitate the achievement of development objectives and guide budget
formulation and budget execution. The MTEF is expected to improve the predictability of
resource flow to the ministries and enhance accountability and service delivery.
50. Government has also announced it would consolidate public finances, publish central
government accounts, wind up off-budget funds associated with the privatization funds, confer
greater independence upon the Bank of Mauritius in the conduct of monetary policy, and
gradually reduce the budget deficit to about 3 percent of GDP by the end of its mandate in
FY05/06. To counteract the decline in tax revenues from 18 percent to 16 percent of GDP that
occurred under the previous government, the new administration announced an increase in the
value-added tax (VAT) from 10 percent to 12 percent and a reduction in tax exemptions. Other
revenue measures designed to increase the tax base are also planned.
Legal, Constitutional, and Electoral Reform
51.
The Mauritian legal and judicial system is sound and effective. Nonetheless, it can be
further improved through modernization and strengthening, particularly in the judiciary.
Mauritius is also keen to improve its political process and plans to undertake electoral reforms.
52.
Mauritian laws are updated continually. To move toward a more high-tech, service based
economy, Mauritius has recently passed wide-ranging legislation to make needed changes in
economic and financial law and address the challenges of terrorism 7.8 The Government places

7 These include the Companies Act 2001, the Trusts Act 2001, the Financial Services Development Act 2001, the
Investment Promotion Act 2001, and the Financial Intelligence Unit Bill 2002.

15

anticorruption and fraud high on its agenda. The Prevention of Corruption Act 2002, recently
approved, seeks to establish an independent commission against corruption to detect and
investigate corruption and money laundering offenses.
The Government appointed an independent commission-the Sachs Commission-in
53.
December 2001 to provide recommendations on legal and constitutional reforms. These
recommendations are currently being reviewed by Govemnment and discussed by the National
Legislative Assembly. There is a consensus that: (i) the dual role of the Supreme Court as the
highest court of first instance in the country and as a court of appeals should be discontinued; (ii)
a separate court of appeals be established; and (iii) both courts should be staffed by different
judges. Thus the terms of reference of the Sachs Commission was "to separate the Appellate
Division of the Supreme Court from other divisions", recommending an appropriate structure.
The proposed reorganization would prevent conflicts of interest, increase expertise, and improve
the working conditions of the judges. The Commission also examined how the quality of the
judicial system could be improved. To strengthen public prosecution, the commission
recommended that a separate department be established to support the director of Public
Prosecutions with a team of professional prosecutors that has the training and experience
necessary to carry out the prosecutor's vital function.
54.
Mauritius also seeks to continue the process of strengthening its democratic system and
modernizing the political process. Thus, the Sachs Commission provided recommendations for
improving the election process and called for a draft bill for public funding of political parties.
The following additional recommendations were made:
a) Presidential discretion in selecting a prime minister from outside the majority party;
b) Proportional representation in the National Legislative Assembly in the selection from
party lists of 30 out of 92 parliamentary representatives; a minimum vote of 10 percent to
be required for representation; selection from the constituencies for the remaining 62
representatives to continue;
c) Increased participation of women in politics;
d) Registration of corporate financing for political parties; higher ceilings for electoral
expenditures by candidates and political groups; and
e) Strengthening of electoral logistics, to include independent setting of the dates for
elections and adoption of a code of behavior for electoral candidates and the media.
Autonomy of Rodrigues
55.
In January 2002, the Rodrigues Regional Assembly and the Amendment to the
Constitution of Mauritius Act came into force. The Act provides for a decentralized form of
government and the establishment of a Rodrigues regional assembly. The regional assembly is
mandated to deal with the administration of Rodrigues and with issues such as the granting of
investment and building permits. It will also have a greater say in the design of the school
curricula to better reflect the history and ethnic origins of the island. In the future, Rodrigues will
be allowed to expand the levying of selected local taxes and decide upon their use. In the
8 The Prevention of Terrorism Bill which has been approved by Parliament, is a direct response to Resolution 1373

of the UN Security Council, of which Mauritius is a member.

16

meantime, however, Rodrigues will continue to rely almost exclusively on transfers from the
Government of Mauritius.
III.WORLD BANK GROUP ASSESSMENT OF MAURITIUS' NEA
Assessment of the NEA
56. The NEA is a sound and bold strategy. The time is ripe to embark on its implementation.
In general, the very high degree of local ownership is the key strength of Mauritius' development
program. Mauritius' reform programs are seldom forced by fiscal or balance of payments crises,
but are self-designed and self-imposed. As a result, program execution mirrors program design to
a very large extent. Mauritius draws expertise from within the country and from a variety of
external sources. The Bank has been asked to assist in the formulation of selected sector plans,
but is by no means the sole advisor in any sector.
57. Government is fully aware of the need to make hard budgetary choices to achieve the
objectives of the NEA without undermining the soundness of public finances or the sustainability
of its debt. In the Letter of Development Policy accompanying the proposed PERL, Government
has outlined a number of key policy measures that will reduce the fiscal deficit by about one
percentage point of GDP a year while redirecting public spending from recurrent to capital
spending in high priority areas. At the same time, planned expenditures are being phased
carefully so as to prevent expenditure bunching, and match the absorptive capacity of the
responsible institutions. To set clearer spending priorities and improve the management of public
resources, Government has decided to introduce a MTEF and has asked the Bank to provide
assistance in developing and implementing it. The Bank plans to respond to this request and
conduct a comprehensive Public Expenditure Review (PER) with the authorities in FY02/03.
Education: The Socioeconomic Rationale for Education Reform
58. Among the high priority areas, the authorities' focus on education is particularly
opportune. It has the potential to create a cohesive society consisting of knowledgeable, highly
skilled, and flexible citizens who are able to derive their livelihood from a variety of economic
activities. However, significant investments and policy reforms in education are needed to fully
achieve its goals, both economic and social.
59.

Economic rationalefor education reform. As mentioned earlier, education reform is

necessary for economic growth because of the country's shortfalls in comparison with competing
high-skill economies. The education gap between Mauritius and East Asian countries is
particularly large and will take between ten and twenty years to eliminate. Government has
candidly admitted that reforms in education are long overdue and that Mauritius needs to catch
up if it is to be successful in creating a skills-based economy. The Government also recognizes
that competitiveness can no longer originate from low-cost labor but will need to rely on
increased labor productivity.

17

60. Social rationaleforeducation reform. The social dimension of Mauritius education
reform program is at least as important as the economic dimension. The Mauritian education
system is elitist. Many Mauritians, especially those that have attended the so-called "starschools," have excelled and now live in conditions similar to well-off middle-class citizens in
OECD countries. However, selected segments of the Mauritian population have been left out of
the benefits of Mauritius' development success. Virtually all of those are school dropouts who
have not completed secondary school, and have low levels of skill. For them, stories of the
Mauritius' "economic miracle" do not correspond to their day-to-day reality. They experience
long periods of unemployment and have difficulty with educational expenses for their children.
And they face the humiliation of their own children dropping out of school, as they did, at an
early stage. They fear that their children will fall prey to drug abuse or criminal activities.
Government is fully aware of the role of education in preventing such social exclusion.
61. The Government's education strategy is a courageous yet overdue move to do away with a
system that creates a privileged elite. Previous attempts to reform education proved politically
controversial and led to the fall of an earlier MSM-MMM coalition Government in 1995. The
current education reform plan is also controversial and entails difficult negotiations on key issues
such as tne number of subjects, teacher workload and retraining, and the composition of the
classrooms, with poorer and richer children mixed in the same classroom. For all these reasons,
the dialogue that Government conducted at the initial stages of the reform was arduous. Now,
however, it is moving along well. All parties accept the need for reform. The Bank actively
supports the proposals to make quality education much more accessible to broader segments of
Mauritian society. The Government realizes that education reform of the type envisaged is a
long-term objective, and requires sustained policy attention and extensive dialogue with all
concerned: teachers, unions, parents, and employers. The Bank would continue to provide
support for reforms in the education sector throughout the CAS period.
Social Cohesion: Getting a Grip on Inequality
62. Mauritius has done remarkably well in maintaining social cohesion between different
ethnic groups and reducing poverty, but inequality remains an issue. The inhabitants of
Rodrigues for example, have not fully benefited from the Mauritian "economic miracle". More
attention will need to be given to providing ample opportunities to disadvantaged groups and
protecting the most vulnerable in Mauritian society.
Unemployment Could Harm the Social Fabric
63. Unemployment is rising and presents a threat to maintaining the social fabric. Between
1990 and 2000, the demand for jobs has increased by a total of 19 percent. New jobs on the other
hand increased by only 15 percent. The high level of demand for jobs stems partly from the
rapidly increasing numbers of educated women seeking work. Among the unemployed, 36
percent did not pass the certificate of primary school education exam. Another twenty percent
did attend secondary school but did not complete secondary education. Thus many of the
unemployed feel rejected twice-first in failing their exams at school and then in the labor
market. In that sense, Government's policy of increasing educational quality and reducing
dropouts may help solve part of the skills mismatch that currently characterizes the labor market.

18

64.
Several policy actions will need to be pursued vigorously in order to reduce
unemployment and create jobs for those entering the labor market. First, the increase in labor
productivity will need to exceed the increase in real wages. Second, hurdles to job creation for
new entrants to the labor markets need to be removed by, for example, encouraging a greater use
of temporary employment contracts. Third, education needs to be better tailored to the needs of
the labor market, and incentives for on-the-job training may need to be provided. Greater
flexibility may also be needed to help two members of one household to work for example by
encouraging part-time work, providing childcare close to the work place, or providing children
of working parents with more public transportation to the schools they attend. The Government
and the World Bank have agreed to carry out joint studies aimed at addressing the
unemployment problem.
Following through on Anticorruption
65.
As mentioned earlier, the new Government was elected on an anticorruption platform and
its anticorruption legislation and program are advanced and address the key challenges.
Implementation and follow-through on this agenda will be essential throughout the CAS period
if broad support for the reform program is to be sustained.
Legal Reforms Can Still Go Further
66.
On legal reform, there remain areas where legislation could be improved and where the
modernization of the legal system should be actively pursued. An example cited by the Mauritian
business community is labor law. Also, the increased focus on information technology makes it
critical for legislation to keep up with advances in the sector. The Law Reform Commission
established in 1992 should be revived and supported with greater resources and staff. It would
thus be enabled to pursue its mandate to manage the law reform process.
67.
One of the most important problems facing the judicial system is attracting the most
qualified legal experts to the judiciary and providing the appropriate incentives to retain them for
lengthy careers. At present, turnover is very high. Judges are given substantially lower
remuneration packages than private sector lawyers, so the attractiveness of a judgeship is
significantly reduced despite the prestige attached to the position. The loss of valuable
experience and continuity is a high cost of this rapid tumnover; reducing this loss by increasing
the financial incentives for long-term service would in fact prove cost effective in the long run.
Furthermore, although the integrity of the judiciary is well respected, poor remuneration could
leave some judges vulnerable to outside financial influence. Finally, the inadequate number of
judges leads to overworked magistrates, a lengthy backlog of cases, and a judicial system that is
slow and unable to respond to the needs placed on it by civil society. Reorganization of the
judicial system is critical to improving the efficiency of the system.
68.
Following the September 11 events, the Mauritian National Legislative Assembly
enacted a tough antiterrorist bill. Members of the parliamentary opposition opposed the bill and
Mr. Cassam Uteem, the president of the republic who had proposed amendments to the bill that
were rejected by the Assembly, resigned. In light of the overall strength of Mauritian institutions
and the nature of the legislation, the recent resignation is not expected to have a major effect on

19

governance, the Government's economic program, or the effectiveness of Bank-supported
interventions.
IV. THE EXPERIENCE UNDER 1997 CAS AND THE NEW CAS
Bank Group Performance and Experience under Previous CAS
69.
Mauritius has been a Bank borrower for the last 22 years. The last IDA credit was given
in 1974. In the 1980s, the Bank supported macroeconomic and sectoral policy reforms through
quick-disbursing loans. Following the success of the structural adjustment effort, the Bank has
focused on project lending.
70.
The 1997 Country Assistance Strategy was aimed at assisting Mauritius to support

71.
Many of the structural issues described in this CAS were already identified during the
1997 CAS. Most notable were Mauritius' reliance on preferential trade agreements and the
weakness in Mauritius' education system. However, until the September 2000 elections, the
vigor with which Government addressed the key structural challenges fell short of the
expectations laid out in the 1997 CAS. The Bank's support during the previous CAS period
targeted the financial, infrastructure, and environmental sectors. However, many activities
envisaged under the previous CAS did not materialize, including an operation in the health sector
and some key analytical work, such as an education study and a health sector review. While
each of the existing projects as well as the new projects performed satisfactorily with very high
20

portfolio performance indicators (percentage of projects at risk at zero, pro-activity and realism
ratings at 100 percent, etc.) the assistance package as a whole did not have the strategic impact
that was originally foreseen.
72.
There are many reasons for the divergence between CAS plans and actual achievements.
One important reason was the wait-and-see attitude on the part of the prior Government on key
policy reforms; this was especially true of those affecting Mauritius' social fabric and those that
are politically difficult to implement, such as overhaul of the education system. The Bank was
too optimistic about its ability to influence the policy dialogue and carry out an ambitious
analytical agenda. On the whole, the Bank's role in helping the prior Government to anticipate
and solve its structural problems and formulate timely policy responses to new challenges was
more limited than anticipated.
The Bank's Existing Portfolio

73. The Bank currently has three projects in its portfolio, supporting the financial and
infrastructure sectors, for a total commitment of US$19 million equivalent and undisbursed
balances of US$11.2 million. The Financial Sector Supervisory Authority project was recently
approved by the Board and is expected to be implemented quickly. All projects under
implementation are rated as satisfactory and are meeting their development objectives. A Port
Development and Environmental Protection project of US$30.5 million was recently closed.

The Bank has also been supporting environmental management through several Global
Environment Fund (GEF) funded operations. The Biodiversity Restoration Project, closed at the
end of 2001, supported technology to help propagate critically endangered endemic plant species
on Ile aux Aigrettes, Round Island and Rodrigues. As a result, Ile aux Aigrette is almost back to
its original vegetation, while the follow-up GEF-funded Restoration of Round Island project
(US$750,000) will continue the long-term efforts needed to restore Round Island. Discussions
are also under way with Government for possible further GEF support in the area of integrated
coastal zone Management for the main land, the Islets and Rodrigues. Lastly, the Bank is also
managing two sub-regional GEF-funded operations under COI (Commission de l'Ocean Indien),
the Regional Oil Spill Contingency Planning Project and the Regional Coral Reef Monitoring
Project.

The New CAS: PERLs and ESW
A Series of PERLs Based on Prior Actions
75.
The Bank lending and non-lending program contained in this CAS supports the
Government's NEA. The financial assistance would consist of a series of public expenditure
reform loans (PERLs) that will support the Government's reform agenda. The processing of the
PERLs would be timed so as to coincide with Government's own budget cycle. The first PERL
(Memorandum of the President, Report No. P-7518-MAS) that accompanies this CAS could thus
be disbursed before the beginning of Government's new fiscal year on July 1, 2002. Follow-up
PERLs would be timed to coincide with Mauritius' budgetary cycle so that proceeds of World
Bank loans are available at the beginning of Mauritius' fiscal year. Thus, the World Bank would
provide a regular and predictable source of long-term finance in support of Govermment's NEA.
All planned lending, with the exception of IFC, MIGA, and Global Environment Facility (GEF)
operations, would take place under the umbrella of the PERLs. World Bank financing of
individual new projects would be phased out and implementation of existing projects would be
accelerated.
76.
The support proposed under the first PERL is justified by the actions undertaken by the
Government under the FY01/02 budget. This budget translates Government's vision of creating a
knowledge-based economy into concrete policy measures and related budget allocations. The
budget was approved by the National Legislative Assembly in July 2001. Thus, an important first
step has been taken in restructuring Mauritius' public finances and aligning budget resources
with the needs of the NEA. The accompanying Memorandum of the President of the first PERL
provides the full details and the justification for the proposed support.
Easing the Transition
77.
The availability of the financing provided through the first PERL and subsequent PERLs
is expected to ease the transition towards a restructured budget that is in line with the
requiremnents of the NEA. The reform measures embodied in the NEA require substantial
additional financial resources over a prolonged period of time. For example, to move to the next
level of development, teachers will need to be recruited and trained, new schools need to be
built, and virtually all new schools will need to be equipped with information technology in the
next three years. This will cause a spike in public spending. Although there is scope for
efficiency measures in education, both the authorities and the Bank realize that it will take time
before these efficiency measures yield results. Bank financing would support the transition
toward an education system that is in line with the requirements of a modern economy. At the
same time, Bank will support other reforms that contribute to reducing the budget deficit.
Heavy Reliance on ESW
78.
To support the NEA, analytical and economic and sector work (ESW) will need to be
strengthened considerably. An amnbitious ESW agenda has been designed and agreed upon with
the Government and selected donors. This ESW agenda would be funded and carried out jointly

22

with the Government, civil society, and selected donors, such as the UN system, the European
Union and the African Development Bank.
Box 2: CAS ConsultationProcess
,xtensive CAS consultations were held with the following institutions: Anou Diboute Ensam; AntiErosion Programme; Basic Education for Adolescents (VEFA); Board of Investment; Caritas; Federation
of Civil Service Unions; Joint Economnic Council; Mauritius Council of Social Services (MACOSS);
Mauritius Employers Federation; Mauritius Freeport Authority; Mauritius Labor Congress; National
Handicraft Promotion Agency; National Trade Unions Confederation; Plantation Workers Union; Trust
Fund of the Social Integration of Vulnerable Groups of the Ministry of Finance; Rodrigues Council of
Social Services; Rodrigues Women's Regional Committee; and Transparency International.
During the CAS preparation mission held in November 2001, two focus groups were organized by staff of
the Trust Fund of the Social Integration of Vulnerable Groups. The first group met in the Northeastern
part of the island and was made up of unemployed men and women in their 40s and 50s. This group had
primarily been employed in the area at recently closed textile factories. They were let go with few or no
benefits and, generally, have no other skills. The majority in this group were women with children, who
were divorced or abandoned by their husbands. The second group was made up of fishermen from the
Southwestern part of the island, one of the poorer groups in the country. Discussions with this group
focused on the difficulties faced by fishermen in earning a living.
A round of CAS consultations was held in January 2002. These consultations were held in part in
Rodrigues and covered a variety of Government funded poverty alleviation programs. In addition,
extensive consultations were held with a number of labor unions to discuss, in particular, the proposed
reforms in education. The Mauritian press (TV, radio, and newspapers) provided extensive coverage of
these consultations.
On the whole, NGOs were satisfied with the consultation process, the openness of the discussions and the
opportunity to express views and debate development issues. The NGOs expressed the need for followthrough on the discussions held with Government and the Bank, and the desire for genuine cooperation.
Some NGOs expressed skepticism of the Bank's intentions and recalled the experience of the adjustment
process in the early 1980s. Among those who recalled this adjustment experience, it was viewed as
imposed from above and as being unnecessarily painful.
Discussions were also held with the key donors such as the African Development Bank, the European
Union and the United Nations Development Programme. Draft documents were shared early and
agreements were reached on exchange of information and collaboration on joint pieces of ESW.
Rationalefor the FY02-04 Strategy
79.
This CAS is based on an ambitious ESW program and brings all World Bank financial
assistance under the umbrella of a series of PERLs. The Bank supports the objectives and the
vision underpinning the NEA and the Government of Mauritius has requested the Bank to
provide financing to directly support the NEA. This financial assistance would be timed so as to
coincide with the budget cycle followed in Mauritius. The Bank has also been requested to reorient its ESW program to focus on areas most relevant to the successful implementation of the
NEA.

23

80.
This request draws upon the lessons of the previous CAS. Even though the Government
found the advice and financing provided under the previous CAS through individual projects and
selected ESW to be useful, it nevertheless feels a different and more flexible approach is required
to meet its current needs. Government also feels that the cost of Bank project financing is
relatively high. Based on Mauritius' reputation and credit ratings, Government is able to secure
project financing on terms that are more competitive than those offered by the World Bank.
However, few of Mauritius' other partners has the ability to provide both long-term financing as
well as relevant policy advice in support of the overall development program. This unique ability
of the World Bank underlies Government's request and the design of the CAS.
81.
In principle, Government could finance higher public spending advocated by the NEA
through increased domestic borrowing, as it has done in the past. However, Government wishes
to limit domestic borrowing to avoid crowding out private sector financing. Mauritius has an
open capital account and assuming that enterprises have the tools to hedge themselves against
foreign exchange risks, Mauritian enterprises could, in theory, borrow from abroad and thus
avoid high domestic interest rates. In practice, however, Mauritian firms have relied almost
entirely on long-standing relations with domestic banks and the rolling over of short-term credit
to meet the need of firms for term finance. It will take time before Mauritian firms start
borrowing abroad and in foreign exchange. As Mauritius' external debt is at comparatively low
levels in relation to its GDP and its exports, the Government has decided to diversify the sources
for its financing needs. Recourse to World Bank financing fits within the overall debt financing
strategy of the Mauritian Government.
82.
From the Bank's perspective, the "umbrella" type of assistance requested by the
Mauritian government makes sense. Mauritius has a development and economic performance
track record that is among the strongest in the developing world. The country also has developed
proven institutional capacity to formulate and successfully implement medium-term
development plans. The CAS builds on this track record by using existing structures to channel
and deliver Bank financial assistance. Contrary to other developing countries, Mauritius needs
neither special World Bank project management units nor earmarked extra-budgetary funds to
implement its NEA. The Bank has reviewed and assessed the accountability framework of public
expenditures. A Country Profile of Financial Accountability (CPFA) was carried out in
September 1998 and an update was made during a November 2001 mission. In February 2002,
the Bank also carried out a Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR). The conclusion
of both the CPFA and CPAR confirmed the overall positive assessment of public sector
management. In terns of key tests such as timeliness of budget approval, execution of approved
budget, preparation of annual accounts, and publication of audit findings, the Bank found the
Mauritian perfonnance to be among the best in the developing world. The discrepancy between
budgeted and actual expenditures for example is minimal and deadlines for budget preparation,
approval and audits have been met without exception for the last decade. Public sector
procurement practices were found to be of high quality with respect to transparency and choice
between competing bids.
83.
In terms of policy measures, the proposed PERLs build on the findings and
recommendations of a 1999 Public Expenditure Review (PER) as well as a number of sectoral
studies carried out with Bank assistance, such as the Transport Master Plan and NEAP 2.

24

Through the PERL, the Bank would support policy measures that it has been discussing with the
Mauritian authorities as a result of past ESW.
84.
Moreover, the PERLs are expected to yield economies of scale by being more cost
efficient than a series of individual projects, as supervision missions for multiple projects and
separate procurement and disbursement procedures would no longer be needed. All activities
would be carried out under the umbrella of the PERL. By centering all Bank activities around
Government's NEA, and designing a program of ESW jointly with the Government, the Bank
can play the role of knowledge broker and leverage its funds with those of Govermment and those
other donors.
CAS Scenarios: Base Case and High Case
85.
In the base case of the CAS, the Bank will lend up to US$80 million for the period FY0204 through two individual PERLs of up to US$40 million each, one in FY02 and one in FY04. In
the high case, the Bank will undertake three annual PERLs, thus increasing the lending envelope
to up to US$120 million over three years. In the low case of the CAS, Bank lending would be
limited to the first PERL of US$40 million in FY02. Throughout the CAS period, and
irrespective of the scenario, a comprehensive program of ESW would be undertaken, consisting
of one piece of formal ESW and two policy papers per year.

As Mauritius' macroeconomic program is on track, Government's fiscal program is
sustainable and a number of significant policy measures have already been taken, the
prerequisites for the first PERL have already been met. The accompanying Memorandum of the
President (Report No. P-75 18-MAS) contains a full description of the policy measures taken and
spells out expected outcomes and specific policy measures that will be supported through
subsequent PERLs.

87.
For subsequent PERLs, a general prerequisite is that the macroeconomic program and
Government's fiscal program continues to be on track and sustainable. Table 6 outlines the
necessary reforms to be undertaken by the Govermnent in the base case scenario, completion of
which will trigger PERL2. Government has requested the Bank to process one PERL every year.
It expects that it will complete all the actions described in Table 6 and the Memorandum of the
President before the end of FY03. Under those circumstances, the Bank would move into the
high case, which will include the processing of PERL2 in FY03 and preparation of PERL3 in
FY04. Overall progress in the implementation of the NEA will be monitored through
Government's policy matrix (see Annex I).

IBRD Exposure in Mauritius
88.
IBRD exposure in Mauritius has declined over the last decade. The proposed assistance
strategy would reverse that trend. But, assuming continued growth and no major increase in
interest rates, IBRD exposure ratios in Mauritius are expected to remain well within IBRD
guidelines over the forecast period. Under the high case scenario with a three-year lending
program of US$120 million, Mauritius' debt service payments to IBRD-expressed as a share of
total debt service on public and publicly guaranteed debt-would increase from 7.4 percent in
26

2001/02 to 13.1 percent in 2003/04 and 15 percent in 2008. As a percentage of total exports, debt
service payments to IBRD are expected to decline from 0.9 percent in FY98/99 to 0.5 percent in
FY04/05 and 0.4 percent in 2008 (see Annex B7).
Role of Other World Bank Group Members
89.
IFC has a total portfolio in Mauritius of US$1.6 million consisting of two projects: a steel
project and a venture capital fund. No new investments have been made since 1996. IFC's main
focus for future activity is to support the deepening of the financial market, undertake advisory
work, and make investments in private infrastructure. These focus areas complement the Bank's
strategy. First, IFC's assistance would increase private firms' access to foreign term finance, thus
reducing demand on domestic savings and alleviating upward pressure on domestic interest rates.
Second, it would allow Government to move gradually out of sectors it has traditionally been
involved in and improve efficiency in the provision of infrastructure. Thus, IFC's involvement
will contribute to the competitiveness objective. In addition, domestic interest rates are expected
to be reduced, relieving Government budget through (i) lower interest payments; and (ii) lower
subsidies and transfers to public enterprises.
90.
MIGA has issued four contracts guaranteeing a total investment of US$58.6 million in
support of an agribusiness project by Mauritian investors in Mozambique. MIGA has also
provided technical assistance to the Mauritius Export Development and Investment Authority.
Given Mauritius' favorable investment climate, MIGA's role in Mauritius per se is expected to
be limited, in contrast with its role in facilitating Mauritian investments in nearby African
countries. Similarly IFC will, in the next few years, focus on the promotion of foreign direct
investment by Mauritian entrepreneurs in countries such as Madagascar, Mozambique, Tanzania,
and Comoros.
Role of Other Donors
91.
The Bank is working closely with the IMF on reform of public resource management, the
tax system, the pension system, and introduction of the MTEF. As Mauritius does not face a
balance of payments problem and its reserves are at comfortable levels, it is on a standard annual
Article IV consultation cycle with the IMF. The IMF advanced its annual Article IV
consultations so as to overlap with a planned PERL mission. Fund staff are expected to present
their staff report and Article IV to their Board of Executive Directors shortly after presentation of
this CAS and the PERL to the Executive Directors of the World Bank Group.
92.
As per capita income in Mauritius has increased, official development assistance (ODA)
has declined significantly. Total ODA in the form of grants now amounts to about US$35 million
a year. Most ODA grants to Mauritius are for the environment sector. The European Union is the
largest provider of grants to Mauritius, mainly in support of the Plaines Wilhelms Project and the
West Coast Sewerage Project. Loans by the European Investment Bank were granted for
infrastructure projects such as the upgrading and extension of the passenger terminal of the
international airport and the rehabilitation and extension of the sewerage system in the Plaines
Wilhelms area. Other donors involved in the environment and infrastructure sector include the
Kuwaiti Fund, the Japanese Bank for International Cooperation, the German Kreditanstalt for

27

Wiederaufbau (KfW), and the World Bank through the GEF. Total existing commitments (grants
and loans) by external donors for the environment for 2002-10 amount to about RslO billon
(US$300 million).

Risks and Mitigation Measures
93.
i.

The strategy faces three risks:
Policy reforms fall short or are not implemented. The scope and depth of the reforms

proposed by the Government for the outer years of the CAS could fall short of what is
required to achieve the three core CAS objectives. This risk would be diminished by
significantly strengthening ESW and ensuring that it is accompanied by extensive policy
dialogue, consultation, and dissemination of information. The experience with the
analytical work on pension reform carried out in Mauritius in FY02 is a good example of
a policy dialogue sustained over a long period of time, based on a series of reports by
many experts, the holding of seminars open to the press and wide dissemination.
ii.

Implementation delays occur. Another risk is that the implementation and timing of the

reforms could fall short of what is currently foreseen. For example efforts cold fail to
bring the education system up to international levels, or weaker political support for the
current Government could lead to a less proactive policy stance and a slow-down in
implementation. This risk can be reduced by ensuring that the reforms are well designed,
fully financed, and lead to the desired results.
iii.

There is insufficient fiscal adjustment. The Government's budget foresees a gradual
reduction in the fiscal deficit to about 3 percent of GDP for FY05/06. This path of fiscal
adjustment leads to sustainable debt levels. The market's assessment of Mauritian paper
is based on the expectation that Mauritius will be able to achieve its fiscal targets and the
economy will continue to grow. There is a risk though that the fruits of the ongoing
transformation into a service-based economy will take longer to materialize than
currently foreseen. If, in the interim period, Mauritius were to face a series of external

28

shocks the debt burden could become excessively high. For example, preferential trade
agreements could come to an end in a period of slowdown in the world economy, a drop
in tourism, and the occurrence of adverse climatic shocks such as cyclones. In that
combination of events, foreign exchange earnings would drop, economic growth would
slow down and the fiscal deficit could increase rapidly. Mauritius' credit ratings could
decline and interest rates could increase. The Government's debt burden could become
unsustainable. In those circumstances, the Bank would need to revise its lending program
and focus on measures that allow Mauritius to return to sustainable debt levels. By
actively supporting the transformation of Mauritius' economy and through instruments
such as the PER, an analysis of contingent liabilities, and the introduction of the MTEF,
the CAS intends to minimize this risk. On public resource management issues, including
the strengthening and broadening of Mauritius' revenue, the Bank is working closely
with the IMF. The Bank is also cooperating closely with other development partners to
maximize the likelihood of success in the transformation of the Mauritian economy.
