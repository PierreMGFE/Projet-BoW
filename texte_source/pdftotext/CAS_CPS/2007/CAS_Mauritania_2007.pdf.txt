MAURITANIA: COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY FYOS-FY11

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
i.

Mauritania is at critical political and economic crossroads. Recent developments pose challenges
as well as unique opportunities for the country’s future. Over 2005 and 2006, the transition government
embarked on returning the country to democracy, with strong popular backing and support from the
international community, promoting freedom o f speech and political participation (culminating in the
recent presidential elections in spring 2007, and the nomination o f a civil government). T o advance
Mauritania’s development, following through o n this commitment i s key. In addition, Mauritania became
a petroleum-producing country in early 2006. Even if lower than expected, relatively substantial revenues
are expected over the next years. The new civil government recognizes the importance o f proper
management o f o i l revenues, which can become a source o f wealth and development for the nation. For
the country to stay on course, support to Mauritania on this promising path i s critical to help establish
necessary capacity, transparency, and growth in the political, social, and economic arenas.

ii. The new government has embraced a roadmap for reform and proposed an ambitious
development strategy. The country’s new Second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP-2) i s based on
a set o f sound macroeconomic, structural, and sectoral policies. The new strategy tackles the fundamental
question o f h o w to manage the natural resource wealth transparently and focus on growth and poverty
reduction. The strategy i s articulated around five pillars. They are to: (a) accelerate growth and maintain
macroeconomic equilibrium; (b) anchor growth in the economic environment o f the poor; (c) develop
human resources and generalize access to basic social services; (d) strengthen good governance and
capacity building; and (e) reinforce monitoring, evaluation, and coordination.

...

Despite progress and a promising outlook, key challenges remain. The incidence o f poverty has
been in moderate decline since 2000 but continues to predominate in rural areas and be a challenge in
urban areas. Social indicator trends have been positive, but the country needs to make more progress
towards achieving the MDGs, particularly in health. There i s a need to increase budgetary allocations to
the social sectors, in particular, health and education. Economic growth has been steady and i s expected
to remain strong, due in part to o i l production. However, the economy remains undiversified. The
government needs to continue focusing o n maintaining the stabilized macroeconomic framework,
strengthening debt management, and reducing exposure to shocks. The PRSP identified cross-cutting
challenges and related priorities, but weak administrative capacity and uncertainty in the country’s future
development must be overcome to make significant progress toward them.
111.

iv. Preparing the FYOS-11 CAS was a participatory process. The new Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) was drafted through a participatory process to ensure that i t s objectives are closely aligned with
country needs and built on lessons learned, a results-oriented framework, and assessment o f the Bank’s
relative added value. The Bank i s committed to assisting the country at this critical juncture. To ensure
greater efficiency and effectiveness in aid allocation and implementation for Mauritania, the Bank will
support government leadership as well as harmonization o f donor activities in the spirit o f the Paris
Declaration. In this context, the Bank has developed a new and innovative approach for better
coordinating i t s assistance strategy with country priorities and other donor activities - based o n
assessments o f sectoral needs, relative added value/expertise and levels o f engagement. The piloting o f a
strategic positioning tool (see Annex C9) has proven to be useful in promoting and informing strategic
selectivity. The government has shown great interest in the tool, and i s willing to coordinate i t s
application to other donors. Furthermore, other donors are interested in applying the tool to their own
planning efforts and all stakeholders are committed to pursuing this approach further in determining
appropriate and more cost effective development interventions for Mauritania.

v.
The CAS strategic objectives are in line with the PRSP, The new C A S focuses on: (a) economic
governance and public sector capacity; (b) diversified growth through investment climate improvement,
and possibly key enabling infrastructures through enclave operations; and (c) continued efforts to fight
poverty and inequalities in both urban and rural areas. The CAS will be implemented through both
upcoming and recently approved lending operations and analytical and advisory activities (AAA). Where
possible and under a continued stable macroeconomic framework, the Bank will foster programmatic
approaches and budget support, particularly in social sectors.
vi. Bank financing is under constraints. In view o f the limited new IDA financing available for
Mauritania, particularly for the remainder o f the I D A 1 4 period, it i s important for the Bank to be very
selective and realistic about what it funds. Due to the high levels o f lending in F Y 0 6 and FY07 to finance
national projects and Mauritania’s participation in regional projects, as well as the impact o f netting-out
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) debt service relief o n Mauritania’s allocation, few resources
are expected to be available in the last year o f IDA14. In the event that n o additional resources become
available in FY08 and IDA15 funding remains similar in magnitude to the IDA14 envelope, the Bank will
have to delay operations in private sector development (PSD) and possibly technical assistance (TA) on
Transport until FY09, with minimal amounts for each o f them. B o t h Education and Urban Second Phase
adaptable program loans (APLs) would be financed with substantially reduced amounts and could be
implemented only in the years following FY09. Should additional financing be available to Mauritania as
a result o f improvements in performance, additional amounts could be allocated to these operations and
Health interventions could be added to the portfolio, providing higher chances o f contributing to the
broader spectrum o f PRSP objectives, as shown in the CAS Result Matrix (Appendix Cl). International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) (guarantees and loans) to support private enclave
projects could be an alternative source o f financing. Should IBRD financing be made available, this could
be used to facilitate and mobilize private financing for missing key infrastructure, energy, and transport
facilities. Despite the improving investment climate, these gaps continue to seriously hamper
industrialization and exports.

vii. Bank support is necessary to prepare the country for a possible transition from low income
country (LIC) to middle income country (MIC) status. In the medium term, Mauritania’s Gross National
Income (GNI) i s expected to be boosted by o i l revenues, possibly leading the country toward M I C status.
T o reach this transition point, it i s important to provide support and prepare the country efficiently. A
proposed PSD operation based o n key Economic and Sector W o r k (ESW) such as the Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP), the Investment Climate Assessment (ICA), and a study on sources o f
growth will be a key pillar o f the Bank’s dialogue on growth.
viii. Recent changes pose political, economic, and development financing risks that need to be
mitigated. For Mauritania, sustaining the momentum o f ongoing reform efforts and managing these
developments carefilly over the coming years will be critical for the successful implementation o f the
proposed country assistance strategy. In this context, the most important risks include: (a) slow-down or
reversal in government commitment to reform, (b) vulnerability o f the economy to external shocks, and
(c) insufficient aid availability to help Mauritania transition into middle-income status. T o adequately
mitigate these risks, the W o r l d Bank has worked closely with the transition government and will continue
to engage the new government in a close dialogue. The Bank will discuss the CAS strategy and
implementation with the authorities but also civil society and the donor community at large. The Bank
will provide advice to the government on prudent policies, fiscal restraint for debt sustainability, and a
careful borrowing strategy to build up resilience to economic shocks. Last, the Bank will focus on
selective interventions, efficient implementation, country capacity building, and collaborative efforts with
other donors to increase overall aid effectiveness and Mauritania’s chances to access additional funding.

I. COUNTRY CONTEXT

A. Socioeconomic and Historical Context
1. Mauritania is a vast country on the western edge of the Sahara desert. I t s population o f more than 3
million people i s growing at 2.9 percent per annum. The population i s heavily concentrated in the urban
areas, including approximately 800,000 in the capital city, Nouakchott. Over 80 percent o f the country’s
land surface (1,030,700 sq km) i s desert; only the southern extremity supports rain-fed vegetation. A
narrow production base and l o w levels o f industrialization characterize the country’s economy. Exports
consist mainly o f fish, iron ore, and, recently, oil. These commodities are highly vulnerable to sharp
swings in international prices and external demand. Attempts at diversifying the economy (tourism,
manufacturing, agriculture, livestock) have had limited success t o date.
2. Mauritania has an intricate dual culture derived from its location and history. In the fifth century
CE, the country was occupied by Nomadic Berbers from Morocco, driving the indigenous population
south and enslaving those who remained. From the eighth to the eleventh centuries, i t was dominated by
the African empires o f Ghana, Mali, and Songhai, followed by the Almoravids; and in the fourteenth
century by the Hassanic warriors. Governed from Senegal by France in 1904, the territory became a
French colony in early 1920 and an overseas French territory in 1946. Nouakchott was selected as
national capital under French colonization in 1957, just before Mokhtar Ould Daddah led the country to
independence o n November 28,1960.
3. Mauritania traditionally has served as a geographic bridge. The country links merchants between
the northern and southern edges o f the Sahara. The social landscape i s characterized by the interaction o f
three main groups: (a) the “black African Mauritanians,” (b) the “nomadic Arab-Berbers” (light-skinned,
descendants o f previously
also known as Moorish or Beydane, or Bedouin); and (c) the “Haratin”-the
enslaved dark-shnned Africans-who identify culturally with the Beydane. The black population i s
subdivided into the Fulani, Wolof, Soninke, and Bambara. All groups are characterized by the observance
o f traditions and a rigid social structure. The tribal hierarchy remains central within the Beydane
community in particular. The interaction among the three cultures has and will continue to define the
country’s political and economic development.
4. I n the 1960s and the 1970s, Mauritania experienced significant structural changes. This period
saw a sharp decline in the importance o f agriculture and-to a lesser but s t i l l significant extentlivestock. This phenomenon was due mainly to the disastrous droughts that repeatedly affected the
country from 1969 to 1974. In the late 1960s, a massive rural-urban exodus began which led to the
accumulation o f tens o f thousands o f nomads in urban centers, often amassed in vast shanty towns. As a
result, the proportion o f nomads in Mauritanian society decreased from 65 percent o f the population in
1962, to 25 percent in 1977, to only 12.8 percent in 1988, to less than 5 percent today. Nowadays, over 60
percent o f the population (1.8 million) lives in urban centers, and Nouakchott hosts approximately onethird o f the total population.
5. These structural changes helped alter the political and social landscape. Due to the droughts and
resulting rural mass exodus to urban areas, the administration suddenly had to face huge demands for
educational, housing, employment, health, administrative, and other services. Under pressure o f losing
revenue, the state bourgeoisie began to merge with a class o f traders who, being the suppliers o f the ruling

-1-

classes, rapidly acquired a privileged status. Since then, the increasing income disparity between the elite
and the rest o f the population has progressively fostered wealth redistribution within a clientelistic
system.
6. Nevertheless, the population still preserves its strong ethno-tribal linkages. The public’s reliance on
public administration i s weak and a majority o f the population relies on a strong traditional system o f
social safety nets. In the last few years, new groups have evolved, such as district associations or
women’s cooperatives, which have permitted the development o f solidarity networks that cross tribal
lines. However, the nontraditional mechanisms to cope with shocks afforded by the extended family have
come under increasing strain as successful urban residents find that obligations to look after the less
fortunate become onerous despite their own incomes having risen substantially. Meanwhile, the incomes
o f rural residents may even have shrunk.
7. Local development remains very limited. The decentralization policy was initiated in 1986 when the
State ratified the principle o f autonomous administration by the municipalities. Since then, selected
ministries have shifted some limited functions to their units in the regions. These moves represent the
starting point o f the deconcentration process that i s expected to take place in the country. Adequate
deconcentration i s perceived by the Government as an important feature o f a strong decentralization
program. Despite notable efforts, the impact o f the reforms has remained limited and local development
dynamics have not taken off. The absence o f a concrete deconcentration policy and the weaknesses o f the
Directorate o f Territorial Administration and i t s decentralized offices (walis, hakems) constitute a major
shortcoming, particularly for local economic development.

B. Recent Political Developments
8, From 1960 to 2005, Mauritania had several regime changes. Mauritania celebrated i t s
independence on November 28, 1960 under the leadership o f i t s first president, Moktar Ould Daddah. In
1978 Daddah was overthrown in a coup by a military junta headed by Colonel Ould Mohamed Saleck
until 1979, then by Ould Haidala, the former Prime Minister. Thus ended the first Republic. After a
period o f instability and coups, Maaouiya Ould Sidi Ahmed Taya staged a successful coup on December
12, 1984. Taya’s regime profoundly shaped the history o f Mauritania. Under his rule, the powerful
Democratic and Social Republican Party (PRDS) was created t o “civilianize” the military regime. A new
Constitution-building
a strong presidential system-was submitted to a national referendum and
approved in 1991, marking the beginning o f the second Republic.
9. 2005 brought about a new development era for the country. A bloodless coup d’Ctat in August 2005
overthrew President Ould Taya, ending his 2 1-year presidency. The coup leaders established a Military
Council for Justice and Democracy (CMJD), headed by Colonel Ely Ould Mohamed Vall, dissolved
Parliament, and formed a new government. The transition government embarked on an ambitious reform
program focusing on three areas: (a) return to democracy; (b) improvement o f the judicial system, and (c)
deepening reforms in the public financial sphere.
10. The previous government committed to a speedy return to democracy and freedom of speech. The
transition government indicated i t s intention to restore democracy within a relatively short time and
received wide support fkom the international community. A constitutional referendum held on June 24,
2006 was approved by more than 90 percent o f voters and was the first in a series o f polls to return the

-2-

country to democracy.' By demonstrating i t s willingness to rapidly hold elections and hand over power to
a civilian government, the transition government quickly earned popular support. In addition, the
international community firmly supported the transitional authorities' roadmap. A few months after the
coup, the United Nations (UN) and major donors, including the European Union (EU), reengaged with
Mauritania and resumed development assistance.

11. Justice is considered a core reform area. The administration completed a report o n the justice sector
in November 2005.2 I t recognized seriously and candidly the main problems affecting the judicial system
in Mauritania. I t presented a series o f ambitious measures for improvement, articulated over the short,

medium and long terms. A number o f measures are underway, including the reorganization o f the court
system and creation o f commercial courts and a legal training center. In this new political climate, the
government i s encouraging freedom o f speech and political participation. Civil society organizations
(CSOs) are organizing to play a more dominant role, particularly in the protection and promotion o f
human rights. In this area, both government and CSOs regard improving the status and protecting the
rights o f women as critical.
12. Economic governance is also at the top of the government's agenda. Several actions taken by the
government since August 2005 confirm i t s commitment to strengthening economic governance.
Furthermore, the government: (a) treated o i l revenues with transparency in the 2006 and 2007 budgets
and engaged in prudent fiscal and monetary policies; (b) set up the National Hydrocarbon Revenue Fund
(NHRF); (c) adhered to'the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), implementing i t s steps in
partnership with civil society and o i l companies; and (d) sought support and technical assistance (TA) in
the o i l sector from the World Bank. These steps symbolize a clear break from past practices. However,
additional steps must be taken, such as the publication o f the production-sharing contracts. Beginning on
July 1,2006, as a result o f i t s proactive, responsible, and transparent actions, Mauritania was granted debt
relief under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI).

13. The new president and government took office in April 2007 and are committed to continue the
reform agenda. Presidential elections on March 11, 2007 marked the last stage o f the peaceful and
democratic transition to civilian r u l e after the military coup o f 2005. Since no candidate received a
majority o f the votes in the first round o f elections, a second round was held on March 25 between the top
two candidates, Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi and Ahmed Ould Daddah. Abdallahi won the second round
with about 53 percent o f the vote and took office in April.3 Since taking office, the new government has
started work - with all 25 ministries appointed - and continued the open and collaborative dialogue with
development partners to advance o n the progress and agenda initiated by the transition government.

1 T h i s vote was followed by municipal and legislative elections on November 19,2006, and elections for the Senate on January
21,2007, culminating in presidential elections on March 11, 2007. The amended Constitution prevents future heads o f state
from remaining in office for more than two consecutive terms. I t also specifies that the Presidential function i s not compatible
with exercising any other private or public function or associating with the executive body o f any political party.

3 With an estimated 70 percent voter turn out, the presidential election was widely recognized as fair and fiee by international
election observers.

C. Snapshot: Poverty Trends
14. Close to 50 percent of the population is still
poor. Poverty remains a predominantly rural
phenomenon. In 2004, the rural poor made up
approximately 75 percent o f all o f Mauritania’s
poor. Among rural areas, poverty i s particularly
extreme in arid regions, where 3 out o f 5 poor
people live. However, it should be noted that
overall poverty incidence was in moderate decline
between 2000 and 2004, falling from 51 percent
to 46.7 percent. In rural areas, it declined by 7
percentage points (fiom 66 percent in 2000 to 59
percent in 2004). During the same period, it
actually increased in urban areas (from 28 percent
to 29 percent). T h i s trend shows that urban
poverty i s becoming an increasingly serious
problem.
15, Inequality remains unchanged. Between
2000 and 2004, the Gini coefficient remained at
0.39, indicating that the moderate decrease in
poverty had not yet led to decreased inequality.
One o f the reasons may have been that the
disparities in income distribution went down
among independent farmers in rural areas but
increased in urban areas, which kept overall
inequality unchanged. The dynamism o f the
private sector in urban areas (mainly the
telecommunications business, financial services,
and o i l sector) increased the wages o f highly
qualified employees. This increase deepened the
gap between the richest and the poorest among
urban dwellers. Inequalities also increased among
public sector employees and self-employed nonfarmers overall.

11. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK

A. Recent Performance: Slump and Recovery (2001-06)
16. I n the early 2000s, Mauritania departedfrom long-standing prudent policies. Despite a relatively
strong growth record after 2000, Mauritania lost i t s reputation o f a strong performer (see table 3).
Indications emerged in 2004 o f significant extra-budgetary spending financed predominantly by credit
from the Central Bank o f Mauritania (BCM). Revised data indicate that significant imbalances and l o w
levels o f foreign reserves had persisted over many years, until mid-2005. The authorities also backtracked
on important structural reforms, most notably in banking, exchange market, governance, and capacity
b~ilding.~
In mid-2004, Mauritania found itself in need o f a radical stabilization to avert a balance o f
payments crisis and to tame double-digit inflation.
17. However, the transition authorities began to re-establish a stable macrobudgetaty framework.
Since taking authority in mid-2005, the transition government took concrete steps to reverse negative
trends. In particular in the last quarter o f 2005, it tightened fiscal policy. The government implemented
expenditure controls quickly. Nevertheless, extra-budgetary operations continued through the summer o f
2005, resulting in additional accumulation o f domestic arrears. However, the transition authorities
stopped circumventing budgetary ceilings and adopted a supplementary budget in November 2005 that
cut non-priority expenditures and adjusted nondiscretionary spending envelopes to realistic levels. These
measures and stopping expenditure commitment orders in mid-November 2005 helped contain the fiscal
defi~it.~

18. Government continued stabilization efforts in 2005-06, and first results began to show. In 2006
growth reached 11.7 percent mostly due to the start o f o i l production.6 (table 2). Strict observance o f the
fiscal and monetary policy stances was instrumental in bringing 12-month inflation down to an average o f
6.2 percent in 2006. Fiscal performance has been strong, reflecting the government’s revenue collection
efforts and sustained spending discipline. As a result, by end-2006, the basic non-oil fiscal deficit was
limited to 4.4 percent o f non-oil gross domestic product (GDP). The external position has begun to
strengthen: gross official reserves increased from US$70 million in 2005 (0.7 months o f imports) to
US$194 million in 2006 (2.6 months o f imports, year-end). Moreover, by the end o f 2006, the parallel
foreign exchange market premium was brought down to insignificant levels.
19. Mauritania ’s external position has benefited from the macroeconomic stabilization. The revised
balance o f payments (BOP) data for 1994-2004 showed that the country’s external position had been
weaker than international economists had thought. The increased imports o f goods and services implied
weaker trade and current account balances throughout the period. Since 2005, the situation has improved
thanks to favorable terms o f trade and the tightened policy stance. The revenues o f the National Iron Ore
Company were boosted by high world market prices, while fish exports increased. In addition to the
4 As a result, the IMF’s Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF), approved in July 2003, was canceled on November
2004, and the World Bank stopped the preparation of the first Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC), planned for FY05.
The IMF Board agreed that Mauritania should repay 2 non complying disbursements under the 1999-2002 PRGF-supported
program (SDR 12.14 million in total, plus the accrued interest) in 2 tranches by June 15,2006. See InternationalMonetary
Fund, “Staff Report for the 2006 Article I V Consultation, First Assessment o f the Staff-MonitoredProgram, and Assessment
of Qualification for the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative” (Washington, DC, 2006).
5 All quantitative indicators under the 2006 IMF Staff-MonitoredProgramwere met. A PRGF (2006-2009) with a total access of
SDR 16.1 million was approved by the IMF Board in December 2006.
6 Oil revenues (including an exceptional signature bonus of US$lOO million) were estimated at US$223 million (10.9% o f nonoil GDP) in 2006.

moderate growth o f non-fuel imports and despite the increased costs o f imported petroleum products,
these positive developments helped improve the underlying external current account balance. The real
effective exchange rate (REER) depreciated sharply between 1992 and 2004. In 2004, it started to
appreciate again, and the Ouguiya i s likely to continue to strengthen for the medium term.

B. Medium-term Prospects
20. The medium-term outlook for the economy is relatively favorable. The recent stabilization o f the
macro-framework combined with the arrival o f o i l revenues yields a positive medium-term outlook. This
i s true even though, by regional standards, Mauritania's hydrocarbon reserves are modest compared with
35 billion barrels for Nigeria, 7.3 billion for the Republic o f Congo, and 2.1 billion for Chad.
Mauritania's proven and probable crude o i l reserves are estimated at 310 million barrels. This figure
corresponds with the estimated capacity o f 3 potentially commercially viable o i l fields in 1 offshore
production zone. With an average o i l production o f 45,000 barrels a day (bpd), the expected production
period i s approximately 20 years. Production in the Chinguetti field, which started in February 2006,
averaged 54,000 bpd in the first three months o f production. However, due to technical difficulties,
production has slowed significantly since then, reaching an average o f only 18,500 bpd in M a y 2007.
With the coming on-stream o f the T i o f and Tevet fields in 2010, o i l production i s expected to peak at
88,000 bpd in 20 15, before declining progressively thereafter.'
2 1. Oil production has improved economic prospects to a lesser extent than fivst predicted. Indeed,
lower than expected production figures from the Chinguetti field have dampened expectations. Average
annual (non-oil) real GDP growth between 2007 and 2009 i s expected to be 5.1 percent. Non-oil growth
will depend, inter alia, on outputs in the agricultural and fishing sectors, and will likely benefit from
rebounds in construction and the continued strengths o f the telecommunication sector. Oil production will
not push GDP growth above 9 percent until 2010, when production i s expected to begin in the two
7 The base-case scenario assumes production in Chinguetti and two additional oil fields (Tiof and Tevet) and a conservative o i l
price that progressively decline to US$32 per barrel through 2015, Under such scenario, oil peaks in 2015: during that year, oil
revenues would constitute around 20 percent o f government revenues and 6 percent of non-oil GDP.

-6-

additional o i l fields (Tiof and Tevet). Per capita gross national product (GNP) i s projected to reach the
US$l,OOO mark in 2010. Based o n current policies, consumer price index (CPI) inflation i s expected to be
brought below 5 percent within the next 2 years, and official cash reserves are expected to reach 3 months
o f import cover starting in 2007. On the fiscal side, the adjustment achieved in 2005-06 will facilitate a
substantial reduction o f domestic arrears under conservative revenue and realistic spending assumptions.
The overall fiscal position will weaken slightly until 2009, when it i s expected to reach an overall deficit
o f 3.9 percent o f GDP, but then gradually improve.

22. The revised oil production figures will affect Mauritania’s external position for the next three
years. The current account balance will decline through 2009, then significantly improve from 2010
onwards. The current account will benefit in the short term from the continued strength o f Mauritania’s
i r o n ore exports along with the beginning o f operations at Akjoujt (copper and gold) and Tasiast (gold).
From 2008, however, the projected decline in the world prices o f these commodities will reduce their
positive contribution to the balance o f payments. Mauritania i s expected to have a financing gap in i t s
balance o f payments. The latest projections foresee unidentified gaps o f US$31.5 million in 2008 and
US$45.2 million in 2009.

23. To avoid the pitfalls of the natural resource curse, Mauritania needs sound macroeconomic and
fiscal policies. Countries r i c h in nonrenewable resources face two key problems: (a) uncertainty and
volatility o f the resource stream; and (b) exhaustible nature o f the resource. In the short run, the challenge
i s to minimize the correlation between government spending and the volatility o f o i l prices by smoothing
fiscal expenditure and avoiding abrupt changes in government spending and non-oil deficits. In the
medium term, the government should aim for an (overall) fiscal surplus, especially given that sound
systems to spend public money are not yet in place. In addition, to stabilize expenditure over time, the
government should establish a medium-term smoothing rule for o i l revenue use (see also Annex C7).
24. The recent debt sustainability analysis (DSA) points to a moderate risk of debt distress. As all
critical external and fiscal ratios remain below the applicable thresholds over the entire D S A horizon, the
D S A suggests a relatively positive outlook for sustainability. However, negotiations for debt relief have
stalled with a number o f bilateral creditors (Algeria, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, and the United Arab Emirates),

-7-

causing Mauritania to build up substantial arrears.’ To ensure debt sustainability, Mauritania needs to
settle i t s debts with these bilateral creditors, and the authorities have requested debt relief under the
enhanced HIPC terms. It also needs to pay close attention to the main risks to debt sustainability,
especially sudden shocks affecting i t s dominant export industries (oil, mining, and fisheries).

25. The government has taken steps to improve its debt managementframework. With the assistance o f
Debt Relief International, the National Public Debt Committee (NPDC) recently prepared an external debt
strategy that will guide the government’s borrowing policy in the medium run. However, Mauritania
needs to strengthen i t s institutional and personnel capacity to manage i t s debt. Furthermore, to avoid the
accumulation o f non-concessional borrowing following the improvements in i t s debt profile due to
MDRI, the government also has committed to borrow only from concessional source^.^

*

Lower-than-expected oil revenues and the inclusion o f this large “passive debt” in the DSA calculations explains why the most
recent analysis considers Mauritania’s risk o f debt distress to be moderate (Le. “Yellow Light”) while the DSA conducted at
the HIPC completion point pointed to low debt distress.
Under the upcoming PRGF.

111. COUNTRY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AND I S S U E S

A. Country Priorities and Agenda
1. Assessment of PRSP-1 Implementation: Lessons Learned
26. Implementation of Mauritania’s first Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper was mixed. PRSP-1 was
discussed along with the Joint Staff Assessments (JSA) by the Bank and Fund Boards in January 2001.
The implementation o f the first poverty reduction strategy (PRS), which covered 2001-04, was broadly
satisfactory, despite the slippages in macroeconomic performance. Approximately 61 percent o f the
actions foreseen in PRSP-1 were completed; 22 percent were partially achieved; and 17 percent were not
realized. Progress was satisfactory in the area o f broad-based growth, but unsatisfactory in governance
and capacity building. Overall, the implementation assessment ‘points to key remaining challenges, in
particular, improving access to basic services such as education, health, and water. Improvements in good
governance faced obstacles in the functioning o f the judiciary, impact o f Parliament, management o f
public goods, and weak role o f civil society.
27. Three principal obstacles prevented effective implementation of PRSP-1. The assessment identifies
these obstacles as: (a) lack o f monitoring and evaluation (M&E) instruments, making it difficult to
systematically keep track o f and assess different interventions; (b) systemic weakness o f public sector
management, especially institutional capacities and information systems; and (c) absence o f meaningful
linkages between sectoral programs and PRSP strategies through the budget instrument.

2.

PRSP-2 Implementation and Objectives

28. PRSP-2 tackles the fundamental question of how to manage natural resource wealth in a
transparent way. Completed in October 2006, PRSP-2 i s based on lessons learned from PRSP-1, PRSP-2
proposes an ambitious poverty reduction strategy based o n a set o f sound macroeconomic, structural, and
sectoral policies through 2015. The strategy i s accompanied by an action plan for the medium-term (to
2010). PRSP-2 i s articulated around five pillars:
29. Pillar 1. Accelerate growth and maintain macroeconomic equilibrium. The achievement o f this
objective will be supported by the ongoing development o f extractive industries as well as basic
infrastructure (in particular ports and electric supply), alongside a reduction in inflation. I t i s recognized
that sustained, non-oil GDP growth i s required to achieve real improvements in living standards.
Therefore, economic policies rightly focus on optimizing the impact o f o i l production o n growth as well
as enhancing private sector activity; maintaining fiscal discipline; strengthening the external position;
implementing financial sector reforms; and improving investment climate, governance, and transparency.
30. Pillar 2. Anchor growth in the economic environment of the poor. The second pillar’s objective i s to
focus on economic activities within the reach o f the poor and their areas o f concentration. This objective
aims to reduce the gap o f access to socioeconomic infrastructures, promote access to adapted financial
services, reduce unemployment through professional training, and promote small and medium-sized
businesses. In the rural areas, the objective o f PRSP-2 i s to reduce the incidence o f poverty from 59
percent to 51 percent by 2010. In the urban areas, i t s objective i s to improve vulnerable groups’ access to
clean water from 35 percent to 50 percent by 2010.

-9-

3 1. Pillar 3. Develop human resources and generalize access to basic social services. The third pillar
identifies the need to develop better access to health and education and to improve gender equality as the
main channels to sustainable development in Mauritania. For education, PRSP-2 sets ambitious targets
with an enrollment rate o f 100 percent to be achieved in 2010 and a retention rate o f 65 percent in the
same year, up from 95 percent and 40 percent, respectively, in 2004. Health will receive special attention
in the upcoming years to improve life expectancy, reduce child mortality and keep human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection low. Gender policy will focus o n girls’ education and women’s
involvement in policy-making and access to employment and economic activities.
32. Pillar 4. Improve governance and build capacity. The fourth pillar highlights specific measures to
improve governance in all sectors including natural resources (fisheries, mining, oil), public
administration, and the judicial system. For the o i l and mining sectors, Mauritania has decided to
implement the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) principles; establish an o i l fund
(NHRF); and prepare, under an open debate, a law for the transparent management o f o i l and gas
revenues. The action plan also includes strengthening institutional and civil society capacities. The
decentralization process will focus on better targeting and reducing inequalities.
33 Pillar 5. Reinforce pilot programs, monitoring, evaluation, and coordination. The PRSP-2 sets out
a detailed monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework, linking priority actions to intermediate
development outcomes and final results. The recent functional classification o f the budget enables
tracking o f expenditures. I t also will facilitate reporting on PRSP execution by enabling linking output or
intermediate outcome indicators with related actions and their respective costs (input indicators). The
government’s efforts will focus on enhancing M&E systems and reporting tools, and reinforcing the
institutional framework.

3.

PRSP-2 and MDGs Targets and Country Status

34. Mauritania will not be able to meet all MDGs by 2015. The PRSP-2 objectives are closely aligned
with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), but not all o f the goals can be met in the expected
timeframe. It i s anticipated that the goals relating to poverty reduction and elimination o f hunger will be
met if public revenues are spent efficiently. The PRSP suggests that the poverty rate could fall as l o w as
25 percent by 2015. However, Mauritania lags in reaching critical health goals. Infant mortality i s
anticipated to fall to 55 percent instead o f the 46 percent targeted under the MDGs, and maternal
mortality i s expected to remain high. Mauritania needs t o make a concerted effort during the
implementation o f PRSP-2 to make more progress on the MDGs in health and access to clean water (see
Table 4).

B. Key Development Challenges
35. World Bank support willfocus on a select number ofpriorities. Priorities presented in PRSP-2 were
analyzed jointly with the World Bank and other development partners and can be addressed only through
a concerted effort. Depending on funding availability and comparative advantages, the Bank will address
the challenges presented below selectively, concentrating particularly on certain key areas. The criteria
and process used for this selection and focus are explained in the section on “Bank positioning” (see
V.D.l) and the discussion o f financing range and related programs in the section o n “Financing under
constraints” (see V.D.3). Since the CAS i s aligned with PRSP-2, the Bank’s evaluation o f key challenges
was shared with the government, and the selection o f priority areas was discussed with the government
and partners.

1.

Cross-cutting Challenges

36. Mauritania is at a criticalpolitical and economic crossroads. The risks faced by Mauritania o n the
threshold o f i t s o i l boom are substantial. Many countries with large nonrenewable natural resources tend
to lag behind otherwise comparable countries in real GDP growth, social indicators, and political stability.
For perhaps the first time in their history, Mauritanians have the choice between two courses o f action
that could lead them in two very different directions. On the one hand, the country could implement the

- 11 -

priority measures in PRSP-2 to generate equitable and sustainable growth, thus increasing trust and
attracting needed foreign investment. On the other hand, the easing o f financial constraints could soften
the elite’s commitment to change and lead to mismanagement o f o i l revenues and backtracking o n
economic and political development. T h i s path could fuel serious social tensions, which in the past have
generated military coups.
37. The economy could already be experiencing Dutch disease effects. A shrinking agricultural sector
and rapid urbanization, with a rapid increase in substantial foreign aid since the 1970s, have resulted in an
expanded service sector. I t i s larger than expected for a country at Mauritania’s level o f development
(over 50 percent o f GDP in 2004, versus 15 percent for agriculture) and limits the extent to which the
Mauritanian agricultural sector has been able to provide an important contribution to early development.
Hence, conditions in Mauritania o n the eve o f i t s o i l boom are fragile and more prone t o the development
o f Dutch disease than in other countries. The real effective exchange rate (REER) depreciated between
1992 and 2004 but has appreciated since then. The future likely appreciation o f the Ouguiya will
exacerbate these trends.
38. Mauritania does not take full advantage of its strategic geographic location. As a border country
between Sub-Saharan Africa and the Maghreb, Mauritania should prioritize i t s interests to maximize
gains while also contributing to the solidarity, peace and stability across the sub-region. Yet, in early
2000, Mauritania left the Economic Community o f West African States (ECOWAS), which weakened the
country’s links with Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), including with i t s southern neighboring countries.
Moreover, i t s inclusion into the Maghreb Union, although logical, has not yet translated into increased
cooperation with regional benefits. Furthermore, the development o f the Senegal River in the south i s
critical since 95 percent o f the country’s water resources depend on it. For the joint management o f the
Senegal River basin, priorities include enhancing water resources infrastructures, reducing waterborne
diseases, and mitigating environmental degradation. Additionally, t o remove trade barriers, the
development o f transportation links, such as the Ross0 bridge and, most importantly, the multimodal
navigation system, are critical.
39. Social characteristicsfurther hamper equitable growth and could cause tensions. A diverse ethnic
mix o f Moors and Black African Mauritanians characterizes the social and political landscape.
Differences among these groups have emerged o n several fronts over the past, notably relating to
representation in the government, choice o f language for education, and access to land along the Senegal
River. Tensions culminated in the 1989 armed conflict. Moreover, due to fairly hierarchical structures
within each o f these groups, power i s often concentrated in the hands o f elites, forming transverse
alliances that further concentrate resources among a few and extend benefits within social networks. This
practice has also characterized aspects o f recruitment in the private and public sectors. Jobs and
promotions are often accorded o n the basis o f personal connections rather than based on free competition
and professionalism. Finally, the concept o f public goods i s little known or respected allowing corruption
to be accepted at times as a legitimate means o f survival.

40. Human resource capacity is weak. Human capital constraints stem from the relatively small
population and the combination o f limited formal education and inadequate business training worsened by
gender inequalities. Public administration, larger firms, and civil society all face this problem. The
creation o f the University o f Nouakchott was accompanied by a reduction o f scholarships granted to
students willing to study abroad. However, the quality and diversity o f curricula offered at the university
i s insufficient to meet the needs o f public administration and large firms. Moreover, training in the public
and parastatal sectors, including the judicial sector, i s sporadic and does not meet all the needs imposed
by accelerated growth.

41. Gender issues remain a key challenge. Sectoral policies have addressed the gender dimension and
reduced disparities in women’s education, health, and access to property as well as to political
participation. The transition government successfully introduced a quota for women o f 20 percent in
political representation. Following the elections in 2006, progress has been visible with women
represented on an average o f 30 percent at regional level, and o f 18 percent at national level (17
mandates). The government should continue i t s efforts to give women broader access to decision-making
in government, as well as in the judicial branch where they are s t i l l noticeably absent. Overall, women are
disproportionately affected by food insecurity, l o w access to economic and financial resources, as well as
basic services, particularly drinking water and electricity. They also often s t i l l face discrimination in the
j o b market and lack full participation in the formal economy.

Key Challenges by Pillar

Pillar 1. Accelerate growth and maintain macroeconomic equilibrium

42. Economic growth and diversity are necessary conditions to reduce poverty. The development o f
extractive industries (oil and mining projects) will drive growth but i s likely to have a much greater
impact on government revenue than on domestic private income and employment. In the same way,
fishing has not been a source o f employment that transformed domestic life. Therefore, it i s not advisable
that the country let i t s economy depend solely on mining, fishing and oil. For broader impact, Mauritania
should diversify i t s economic and export base and attract private investment in agriculture, livestock,
manufacturing, and tourism.
43. Mauritania faces key challenges in private sector development. The formal economy base i s very
narrow, with a nascent manufacturing sector and very limited diversification. The Bank’s “Doing
Business” Survey for 2007 ranks Mauritania 148 o f 175 for ease o f doing business and 164 for starting a
business. Enterprises carry a heavy tax burden representing 104 percent o f their net profits, and trading
across borders i s extremely costly. The Bank’s recent Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) points out
several issues: (a) a deficient business environment compounded by governance issues; (b) inadequate
access to financial services; (c) a weak legal framework and judicial system and difficulty in enforcing
contracts; (d) l o w quality and high cost o f infrastructure services, particularly transport, energy, and
telecommunications; and (e) a weak s k i l l s base. A strong reform program i s needed to improve the
investment climate, boost small and medium enterprise development, structure the investment effort
necessary for diversification, and develop public-private partnerships to develop infrastructure.
44. TheJnancial sector is far from contributing to the development of the country. The financial
In i t s current state, the banking sector does not have
landscape i s dense but fragmented and
the potential to effectively contribute to shared growth and the development o f the private sector, or to
participate efficiently in the use o f petroleum resources. Several commercial banks present are essentially
subsidiaries o f commercial and industrial groups, resulting in a segmented banking system characterized
by limited competition. These banks mainly deal with members o f their group. Customers who do not
belong to these groups have difficulties in obtaining financial services. Furthermore, public trust and the
banlung sector’s efficiency are limited by the general absence o f reliable financial statements and the
weahess o f the accounting profession. The microfinance sector i s s t i l l emerging, and the insurance sector
i s far from reaching i t s full potential.
~

lo

The financial sector includes 9 commercial banks, 1 quasi-bank, 7 insurance companies, 142 microfinance institutions, postal
financial services, a social security institution, a money market, and a foreign exchange market. There are n o bond and
equity markets. The ratio o f money supply to GDP i s 3 1%, the ratio o f deposits to GDP 20%, and that o f credit to GDP
18.7%.

- 13 -

45. Progress in the financial and private sectors requires strengthening the legal and judicial system.
The legal and regulatory framework governing credit activities has serious shortcomings. Developing an
adequate and efficient legal framework for collateral debt collection and enforcement o f contracts i s
essential. The application and enforcement o f laws and contracts i s weak since many judges involved in
commercial and financial cases lack the necessary training and specialization. Courts are also seen as
among the most corrupt institutions in the country. T o change this image, it i s crucial that laws are
properly applied by the appropriate judicial branches, and accessible and clearly understood by domestic
and foreign investors, legal and judicial communities, and the public. In the long term, the formulation o f
a legal strategy for land reform will be equally important.

46. Continued governance reforms will be needed to unleash the potential of the fisheries sector.
Fisheries have the potential to serve as a primary engine o f economic growth and employment both in
rural and urban areas. Unfortunately, despite a growing capacity in the government and recognition o f the
need for sustainable management o f the resource base, weak environmental governance has resulted in
overexploitation o f many o f the most valuable fish stocks in recent years. At the same time, much o f the
value generated by the fisheries resources i s captured “offshore” by foreign fleets. Thus, the fisheries
sector i s faced with the dual challenges of: (a) ensuring the sustainability o f the fish stocks and
(b) increasing the domestic share o f the value generated by these resources. These challenges require
steps towards: (i)
improving fishery governance, which i s fundamental both to create an attractive private
investment climate and to equitably allocate fishing rights among small-scale fishers, local industrial
vessels, and the foreign fleets; and (ii)
increasing investments in infrastructure and in modem fishing and
processing assets.

47. The quality of infrastructure needs to be improved. Infrastructure should play i t s role as a facilitator
o f economic development and poverty reduction. Private sector development and firms are especially
vulnerable to the quality and supply o f infrastructure, namely transport, electricity, water, and
telecommunications networks. An inefficient and poorly managed road transport sector raises transaction
costs and affects competitiveness. Despite some progress over the last five years, Mauritania’s transport
sector has been plagued by numerous institutional problems. Similarly, infrastructure in the air transport
sector, particularly in Nouakchott and Nouadhibou Airports, i s poor and deteriorating and requires
immediate intervention. In the maritime sector, the port o f Nouakchott i s facing wharf capacity and draft
limitations to meet i t s growing container traffic. Whereas the port o f Nouadhibou i s facing negative traffic
growth due in part to competition from the Canary Islands, depletion o f fish stocks, and changes in fishhandling regulations.

48. Sufficient electricity supplies are not assured and remain expensive. Despite the decision taken by
the government in 1998 to privatize electricity activities in four phases, the privatization o f the
Mauritanian National Electricity Company (SOMELEC) has not taken place yet. The difficulty in
attracting foreign private investors can be attributed to a combination o f factors, notably internal
structural handicaps, such as: (a) the relatively small size o f the Mauritanian electricity sector; (b) i t s
dependence o n operating subsidies; (c) public pressure to expand access to unprofitable customers in poor
urban areas and isolated districts; (d) weak commitment by the government to root out mismanagement;
and (e) past history o f noncompliance with tariff-revision mechanisms. Furthermore, after reaching the
HIPC completion point and receiving debt relief for Mauritania, incentives to reform the water and energy
sectors seem to have diminished. Going forward, there i s a need to reformulate the reform strategy for the
electricity sector and agree o n a realistic path for private sector participation to develop the recently
discovered gas resources for power generation, strengthen the regional electricity grid, improve service
delivery o f SOMELEC and increase access to electricity in urban as well as rural areas.

- 14 -

Pillar 2. Anchor growth in the economic environment of the poor

49. Development of the agriculture sector remains far below its potential. Given that poverty remains a
predominately rural phenomenon, it i s important to boost rural growth. Agriculture continues to fmish
the principal livelihood for h a l f the population, primarily through herding and farming. In 2004, these two
areas contributed an estimated 12.4 percent and 2.8 percent o f GDP, respectively. Estimates suggest that
the combined agricultural sector, including cropping and livestock, could provide the equivalent o f 30
percent o f current GDP-double the sector’s 2004 level. Moreover, the multiplier effect from agricultural
incomes would expand local demand for input supplies and for simple consumer goods, downstream
products for agroprocessing, and more sophisticated distribution. So far, agroprocessing i s underexploited, with untapped opportunities in canning, food-drying, juice production, animal feed, dairy
products, poultry, and leather products for both domestic and export markets.
50. Multiple factors prevent sustainable rural development. Prohibiting factors include: (a) lack o f
adequate infrastructure such as roads, irrigation, agro-processing facilities, and more sophisticated
distribution networks; (b) lack o f microfinance; (c) insufficient mastery o f modem techniques and
technologies by producers and professional associations; (d) poor services to producers; and (e) slow
process o f land titling, resulting in property rights not being secure enough for the private sector to invest.
Finally, the policy o f decentralization and local development neither fosters effective participation o f
beneficiaries nor provides transparent transfer o f funds toward the rural communities.
5 1, Inequalities continue to increase in urban areas. Rapid and sometimes uncontrolled urbanization
has characterized the past four decades. Reduction o f inequalities between the inhabitants o f periurban
districts and those o f the residential central districts, and between the capital city and secondary cities, has
become a major challenge. T o address this issue, several constraints need to be recognized: (a) the
insufficient juridical framework governing land and urban planning, and inadequate coordination among
the different actors; (b) weakness o f municipalities in their relationships with the Ministry o f Finance
(MF) and the local representatives o f the Minister Interior, Post and Telecommunications (MIPT);
(c) shortcomings in financial, human, and technical resources in public departments involved in the urban
sector, especially at the local level; and (d) weak capacities in the construction sector.
Pillar 3. Develop human resources and generalize access to basic social services
52. Improve access to education at all levels through government’s determined reform agenda. The
reforms include: (a) introducing bilingual education in Arabic and French; (b) restructuring preservice
education to train bilingual primary teachers; (c) restructuring vocational, technical, and tertiary education
to respond to social needs and labor market demands; and (e) improving the overall quality o f the
education system. Thanks to this ambitious agenda, the government has made significant progress in
improving access and approaching gender parity in primary and secondary education in the last few years.
Between 2002 and 2003, gross enrollment rates increased at primary schools from 88.7 percent to 95.1
percent and at secondary levels, from 52.8 percent to 61.1 percent.
53. Education reforms take time and key challenges remain. K e y priorities lie in improving student
retention rates and the quality o f professional vocational training. Retention at all levels o f the education
system remains low, despite a reduction o f the repetition rate in primary education. Quality has not
improved and even deteriorated in some cases, as shown by the decline in primary completion rates by 10
percent between 1999 and 2004. Language s k i l l s development among both teachers and students i s a
priority. The majority o f teachers continue to be monolingual in Arabic, despite the education reform
mandate to institutionalize bilingual education (in French and Arabic) at the primary and secondary levels
o f education. The challenge i s to decentralize decision-malung to the local level while ensuring that the
central level oversees the quality and coherence o f the overall education system. Finally, the demand for

- 15 -

professional and vocational training as well as tertiary education i s growing. Despite the implementation
o f an ambitious donor-supported national education program, the high unemployment rate for graduates
o f the higher education system indicates that Mauritania's education and training programs do not meet
labor market needs.

54. Continued efforts are needed to address critical health care issues. During the last decade, the
government has strengthened the health delivery system. Access t o services and the geographic
distribution o f health personnel have improved. For instance, in 2005, child immunization rates reached
64 percent; 63 percent o f deliveries were assisted by a health provider; and the number o f consultations
per inhabitant increased t o 0.3 per year. However, while access to maternal health care has improved,
little progress was made between 2000 and 2004 in reducing child and infant mortality rates (respectively,
132 and 84 per 1,000).." Mauritania needs to make a concerted effort during the implementation o f the
PRSP to make more progress on the MDGs in health. Chronic malnutrition rates remain a serious
problem in rural areas among the poorest and the very young (0-3 years). Nearly one-third o f children
suffer from this condition. Finally, population growth remains high at approximately 2.9 percent (2005),
indicating that the population will double in 23 years.

55. Several issues continue to hamper the performance of the health sector. They include:
(a) insufficient and inequitable access, including problems with affordability and utilization o f health and
nutrition services; (b) inadequate financing and inequitable resource allocation; (c) shortages and l o w
motivation o f skilled health care providers; (d) inadequate drug quality and supply; (e) insufficient
institutional capacity; and (0 poor management o f service provision. PRSP-2 and the Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework (MTEF) for the sector highlight these issues. B o t h government and external
partners active in the sector are providing technical and financial support to develop a more functional
health system.
56. Access to potable water is slowly improving, but disparities persist. In 2004, 53.5 percent o f
households had access to potable water, versus 50.4 percent in 2000. In urban areas, 30 percent o f
households access drinking water via private connections. T h i s proportion drops to 20-24 percent in
Nouakchott. Furthermore, the high price o f water in urban areas, particularly in deprived zones,
constitutes a major concern. In rural areas, 49 percent o f households have access to drinking water. More
than half o f centers with more than 500 inhabitants are not connected to drinkable water supply networks.
Access to sanitation i s s t i l l low: in 2004, only approximately 36 percent o f households nationally had
access. According to a 2004 study, 20 percent o f households had access t o sanitation in rural zones, using
autonomous systems. In urban zones, 55 percent had access, o f whom 3 percent nationally were
connected to the collective sanitation system. Access o f the poor to water and sanitation services should
receive serious attention because o f their well-known impact o n child mortality.
Pillar 4. Improve good governance and capacity building

57. Enhancing governance is crucial to achieve the country's development objectives. Governance i s a
particularly important issue for Mauritania, given the negative experiences o f other resource-rich
countries related to weak governance and corruption. International governance indicators, as well as a
recently completed Bank Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) survey, show that a significant level o f
corruption already exists in Mauritania. Over the last years, efforts o f the transition government as well as
signals from the new government have been promising in instituting democratic procedures but more
work and commitment i s needed to establish good governance throughout the political system. As in
other countries, poor governance manifests itself in several ways: i t has undermined the integrity o f
decision-making and the efficiency and transparency o f public financial management. It i s associated with
Source: World Development Indicators 2005, World Bank.

- 16-

a weak rule o f law, an inadequate legal framework, and a judicial system that lacks independence.
Accountability to stakeholders remains very limited, as civil society has only superficial participation in
decision-making and as accessing public information i s s t i l l difficult. Improving governance will be a key
factor in determining whether the new o i l wealth will improve citizens’ lives, including those o f the most
vulnerable groups.
58. The administration’s human resource management is weak Limited capacity i s primarily based on
an outdated, centralized, and poorly adapted model. The c i v i l service i s also characterized by lack o f
transparency and lax controls for recruitment, amount o f remuneration, j o b definitions, and financing (at
the central, project, and local level). The management o f salaries as well as human resources i s overly
centralized at the Directorate o f Civil Service and Administrative Reform (DGFPRA) and Directorate o f
Budget and Accounting (DBC) Pay Unit. Management involves multiple layers. Each decision regarding
career management requires the approval o f five entities, including the President’s Office. Computerized
management systems at DGFPRA and DBC-Pay Unit level are outdated and not operational.
59. Public resource management also suffers from weak administrative capacity. Increased capacity in
this area would help Mauritania harness i t s natural resource endowment more efficiently in order to
generate sustained development. Without efforts to build institutional capacity in government, even the
best policies are unlikely to be efficiently implemented. The reform o f the public financial management
system will have to play a central part in improving governance and in delivering on any reform strategy.
T o facilitate a more efficient and transparent management o f public resources, reforms need to focus
particularly o n deficiencies in planning, budget execution, and procurement. Systems and procedures
need to be updated to strengthen accounting and reporting functions. Internal and external control
mechanisms (including audits) need to be improved by strengthening the relevant institutions (State
General Inspectorate, Audit Office, and Finance General Inspectorate).

60. Steps have been taken to strengthen governance in the nonrenewable sector but need to go further.
On April 4, 2006, the Military Council for Justice and Democracy (CMJD) adopted an ordinance
establishing the NHRF as an institutional fiamework for the transparent and effective management of
revenues f i o m the petroleum and mining sectors. Broadly in line with the Bank and Fund
recommendation, this ordinance established a “Hydrocarbon Fund” as an offshore account that would use
o i l revenues t o finance the non-oil budget deficit. However, at this juncture, the overall legal framework
and procedures concerning o i l and mining need to be strengthened. Inparticular: (a) the links between the
NHRF and the annual budgets need to be clearly defined; (b) Parliament’s surveillance role over the use
o f the o i l fund i s to be stressed; (c) procedures with regard to the NHRF revenue (most notably, tax
revenue) assessment, collection, and certification should be strengthened at the level o f the General Tax
Directorate (GTD); and (d) the investment approach envisioned for the NHRF resources should be
developed as the fund’s assets grow. Further work i s also needed to modernize the o i l and mining laws
and revise the model production sharing agreements for o i l and gas.
61, Since its inception in 1986, the decentralization policy has made little headway. Independent cities,
a few spread-out ministry units, and an existing but inefficient regional development fund constitute only
the starting point o f a slow process so far. T h i s situation i s particularly alarming considering the poverty
profile o f rural areas and the imminent flow o f o i l revenues which, without an effective financing
mechanism, will increase the disparity between major cities and the rest o f the country. This disparity
could lead to social tensions, which have contributed to undemocratic regime change in the past. This
poor performance was due to an insufficient political will and the absence o f a global vision leading to a
weak and poorly equipped department in charge o f decentralizing the DGCL (General Directorate o f
Local Governments). The new government includes a Ministry o f Decentralization. This Minister will
have to take up those challenges, particularly by reforming the regional development fund and
coordinating the efforts o f the several donors that have been working in this area.

-17-

62. Weak civil society organization capacity prohibits their active participation in public management.
Poor specialization and professionalization does not permit civil society organizations (CSOs) to
participate fully and effectively in the definition, implementation, and monitoring o f public development
policies. These policies include good governance measures and operationalizing proposed government
strategies. CSOs are often concentrated in the same sectors and sometimes do not take into consideration
the government’s priorities. Even if the transition process i s an opportunity for CSOs to participate in the
public debate, the communication between CSOs and government has been inadequate in some cases,
with the dual results that neither CSOs nor the government are sufficiently informed o f CSOs’ activities.
While there has been some recent good experience in building the capacity o f national civil society,
particularly NGOs, through partnerships between international and national NGOs, these efforts thus far
have been too sporadic and ad hoc to have a significant impact. A more strategic and programmatic
approach i s required to address the institutional development and training needs o f national civil society
representatives in Mauritania.
Pillar 5. Reinforce strategic oversight of programs, monitoring, evaluation, and coordination

63. Poor ownership, data availability, and monitoring capacity threaten implementation. For successful
realization o f its development objectives, lessons learned in Mauritania and across other countries have
shown that the government needs take increased responsibility for piloting, monitoring, assessing, and
coordinating PRSP objectives and related projects. Beyond the Results Framework, mechanisms o f data
collection, analysis, and reporting must be in place prior to PRSP-2’s execution. The PRSP-2 itself
highlights the issue o f data availability: so far only 38 percent o f proposed indicators have baseline data
for 2004. Although the overall reporting system has been designed and the key actors were identified
during PRSP-2 preparation, in i t s present design, the M&E process may be too complex to implement. In
particular, PRSP-2 underlines the very weak M&E capacity o f the public administration.

IV. BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE STRATEGY

A. Progress under the FY02-05 CAS and Lessons Learned
1. General Overview
64. The 2002-2005 CAS was aligned to assist in the implementation of the PRSP. The prior Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) focused on: (a) accelerating private-sector-led growth; (b) anchoring growth in
the economic development o f the poor; (c) developing human resources and ensuring universal access to
basic infrastructure and services; and (d) enhancing institutional development and governance. That CAS
aimed to build local capacity and to focus on programmatic support through three planned Poverty
Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs), one for each year o f the CAS. The main ambition o f the 2002 CAS
was the planned shift to programmatic lending, which was going to be underpinned by the Bank’s core
diagnostic Economic and Sector W o r k (ESW). However, the 2002 CAS never achieved i t s main
objectives entirely. The shift to programmatic lending did not occur and the lending program, which was
designed around the preparation o f three PRSCs (FY03-04-05), was never fully realized.
65. A number ofplanned activities had to be dropped orpostponed. T o accommodate changing country
conditions and government priorities, CAS program implementation swayed from i t s original design
which was closely linked to the initial strategic base o f the PRSP. Remaining flexible in i t s response,
project selection and implementation could not always follow the systematic approach originally defined.
Due to shifts in the relevance and adequacy o f government priorities and programs, certain operations
were delayed until the end o f the CAS period; some scale-ups became full-blown operations; and some
planned projects were not delivered at all. For lending operations, the CAS was not used as a prescriptive
management tool but changed rather significantly soon after i t s discussion by the Board.
66. Operations were a mix of successes and failures. Operations were implemented in the mining and
urban development sectors. However, in the infrastructure sector, energy and water sector projects went
o f f track for a variety o f reasons such as delay or a lack o f local ownership. In the social sectors, nutrition
and health sector projects were moderately successful. However, the education sector failed to meet two
o f the key government’s needs: bilingual teacher training and vocational training.
67. Successful ESW by the government and the Bank helped establish a knowledge base.
Notwithstanding changes in the lending portfolio to accommodate changing country circumstances,
improvements in the knowledge and analytical base helped underpin the Bank’s policy dialogue and
project design. Despite political instability and weak capacity, the C A S implementation period saw a
number o f successful E S W products. The sectoral MTEF influenced dialogue in infrastructure sectors. In
addition, the Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) delivered in FY03 fostered cooperation with the
government and dialogue on private sector development.
68. IFC and MICA activities were limited. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) staff-force in
Dakar was limited. Consequently, Mauritania did not have an IFC staff solely dedicated to it. Generating
new activities proved difficult and only one transaction was approved in 2004. However, in 2005 and
2006, the trend improved with 2 and 3 projects approved respectively. As o f end-2005, IFC’s portfolio
stood at US$19.8 million, comprising 2 projects in the banking and agribusiness sectors (as o f June 30,
2006, IFC’s committed portfolio stood at US$46.3 million). In 2005, IFC disbursed a US$10 million line
o f credit, i t s fourth loan, to the Mauritanian General Bank (GBM). Through the years, this bank has
benefited from IFC technical assistance as well as financial support to become one o f the country’s largest

- 19-

and most active lending institutions. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) signed a
US$25 million guarantee in March 2002 in support o f Tunisia Telecom's operation through the local
Mauritanian company Mattel. Furthermore, in 2003, MIGA started discussions with both Woodside and
Hardman o n the Chinguetti offshore o i l project.

2.

Conclusions Drawn from Implementation of 2002-2005 CAS

69. Lessons can be drawn from the Bank's andpartners' assessment of the previous CASperiod. First,
ex post, the Bank considered the 2002-2005 CAS overly ambitious and not selective enough. Second, the
Internal Evaluation Group (IEG) reports, and partners point out, the scarcity o f reliable data. At the
macroeconomic level, this negatively impacted World Bank efforts to improve transparency and public
resource management. At the project level, the absence o f a results-based CAS framework limited the
reliability o f the M&E system. A third concern raised i s the weakness in the country's management
capacities and role within the development process, including l o w absorption capacity o f the
administration, agency red tape, insufficient technical and managerial capabilities to implement the
projects, and human resource gaps. Finally, another lesson raised was the need for the Bank to establish
better coordination mechanisms with the government as well as among development partners, and for the
Bank to introduce simpler operational policies and procedures.

70. IFC had limited impact on the development of the private sector. Indeed, I F C was unsuccessful in
addressing fundamental obstacles to private investments, helping to improve the investment climate in
general and in engaging specific areas in which it can support investment projects. This insufficient
presence was mainly due to the lack o f dedicated staff for Mauritania, which led to inadequate dialogue
and little visibility.

3.

Strategic Elements of the NOS-011 CAS

71. The new CAS builds on the main conclusions of the CASCR and IEG evaluation. The new C A S
emphasizes results management and making adequate data collection a priority through a separate pillar
on strengthening M&E systems. The new CAS strategy and program have been defined in support o f
country priorities and development goals (as presented in PRSP-2), with a strong emphasis o n
strengthening institutional capabilities at the country level. During CAS preparation, the CAS team took
into account the need for stakeholder consultations and improved coordination with other donors and
government. The Bank exercised strategic selectivity to define a realistic and sustainable country
program, with focus on key areas o f highest impact and its comparative advantage in comparison to other
donors.
72. IFC and M I G A activities will pay attention to lessons learned from prior operations. I F C and
MIGA were substantially involved in the preparation o f the new CAS and therefore were able t o align
their strategy to complement WB activities in Mauritania. Their focus was to more efficiently support the
country's private sector. IFC's professional staff in Dakar i s being strengthened to increase anticipation
and reactivity, enabling more frequent project identification visits to Mauritania and regular dialogue and
collaboration with the World Bank. MIGA also will be taking a more active role in Mauritania. MIGA
will engage in regular discussions with IFC and WB counterparts on potential project leads, running i t s
program out o f i t s Johannesburg and D C offices. IFC's and MIGA's strategy for Mauritania will be to
work increasingly with the Bank to support government reforms in the financial sector, infrastructure, and
oil-related industries and services to prepare the country for significant investments in the private sector
over the next few years.

greatly facilitate Bank operations in Mauritania and reduce the transaction costs of implementing Bankfinanced projects by allowing for the financing o f taxes and import duties. The maximum flexibility
allowed by the CFPs will nonetheless be applied selectively, with due regard to sustainability and
fiduciary oversight. Going forward, the current arrangements will need to be reviewed periodically and
towards the end o f the CAS period, as Mauritania has prospects to undergo transition to an IDA blend or
eventual IBRD country.
75. Since the completion of the last CAS, the Mauritania Country Office implemented close
management of I D A projects. The portfolio monitoring system developed at the Country Office (CO)
provides a sound system for tracking progress, i s accessible to WB partners online and i s based on three
simple communication tools: (a) monthly project implementation progress note (Fiche Projet),
(b) portfolio recommendations table, and (c) no-objection and withdrawal applications follow-up tools.
The system compares the performance of the IDA projects through indicators classified in 5 categories:
(a) results; (b) alignment; (c) risk; (d) efficiency; and (e) data integrity. The monthly project review and
revision o f these indicators enables a quick glance at project issues and speeds up the appropriate
response. T o ensure more efficient data flows and improved communication with the Ministry o f
Economy and Finance information systems, these monitoring tools eventually will be available and
accessible to the Bank’s counterparts as online services.
76. Close monitoring has directly and greatly improved portfolio performance. There are currently no
problem projects and n o projects at risk, and T T L s are taking proactive actions to close and/or restructure
nonperforming projects. Since implementation o f the monitoring system began, the average response
delay to no-objections and withdrawal applications has been reduced from 20 to 9 days, disbursement lag
has dropped from 40% to 23%, and data integrity has been improving. The average portfolio performance
has improved with a rating o f 315 in December 2005 to 4.215 in March 2007.

77. The M&E system for IDA-financed projects is an efficient mechanism and should be expanded.
For a more accurate picture o f the Bank’s overall intervention in Mauritania, portfolio monitoring should
focus on integrating regional projects and Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA) more closely. T o
this end, the information exchange framework between the CO and Regional projects has to be clearly
defined. Similarly, the M&E process should be used consistently across AAA operations teams, to
provide both the CO and the government o f Mauritania with a good communication platform on the nonlending agenda.

C. Partnerships and Participation
1. CAS Participatory Process and Partner Coordination
78. The FY08-11 CAS was draped through a fullyparticipatoryprocess. Aiming to build a coordinated
strategic approach based o n the country’s development priorities as outlined in the new PRSP, the CAS i s
based o n in-depth discussions with the government and other donors. During the consultation phase, two
major workshops were held, in March and June 2006, that convened almost 200 representatives from
donor organizations, ministries and civil society. In-depth discussions took place on alignment with
PRSP-2 objectives, areas o f focus, levels o f assistance, and coordination o f procedures and results
management. The CAS, developed in a closely coordinated process, reflects clear guidelines for support
from all donors to achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness in aid allocation and implementation for
Mauritania.
79. Mauritania is a signatory of the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. The country took part
in the 2006 OECD monitoring exercise o f associated indicators. The government shows a clear
commitment to the Paris Declaration’s agenda o f harmonization, alignment, and managing for
development results. The government’s plans include strengthening implementation and statistical
capacity at national levels (for example, through the National Strategy for the Development o f Statistics);
reviewing sectoral memoranda o f understanding (MOUs) with donors; revitalizing the dialogue with
donors to formulate a partnership framework, aligning donor support, and implementing the PRSP
accordingly. Together with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Bank has provided
support to the MAED to produce a diagnostic o f existing harmonization and alignment efforts in
Mauritania to lay the basis for a future action plan on aid effectiveness. Progress toward more harmonized
aid modalities depends o n continued efforts to strengthen country financial management and procurement
systems, and to improve sector strategies and the MTEF with effective links to the annual budget.

80. Progress on aid effectiveness requires a broad set of actions. Country ownership as well as strategic
donor engagement based o n an analysis o f comparative advantages and improved harmonization will be
key. Mauritania’s government should continue to take the lead in defining development strategies and
policies and in assessing aid efficiency. I t can achieve the latter by ensuring carehl and publicized M&E,
fostering coordination among donors, better managing aid flows, and enabling harmonization. Donors
will have to continue their efforts on better coordinating their analytic work, reducing the use o f parallel
project implementation units, and relieving the Mauritanian administration o f the heavy burden caused by
almost one donor mission per calendar day. Simultaneously, the government and donor community must
collaboratively identify the comparative advantages o f each donor in response to sector needs. Taking this
action has proven very successful in the definition o f the proposed CAS and will strongly improve
coordination and allocation o f public aid (see V.D. 1 o n “Bank positioning”). The following paragraphs
provide an overview o f all donors engaged in Mauritania.

2.

Partner Strategy and Positioning

81. Enhanced efforts will be needed to support the country’s objectives in terms of growth and
governance. Throughout the PRSP process, key concerns and priority areas for Mauritania’s development
have been determined. Going forward, the government will need sustained and focused support by all
partners to advance on this agenda. For example, the progress already achieved in transport infrastructure
can be solidified through extended consultation efforts among donors to achieve better financial coverage.
Furthermore, land-use planning, which features among PRSP-2 priorities, would benefit from a sharper
assessment o f analytical and financial needs. Likewise, better analytical and financial coverage o f the
energy, private sector, fisheries and tourism sectors would intensify support to growth objectives.
Particularly, the areas o f private sector development and tourism would benefit from more sectoral
expertise and capacity building. Finally, sustained efforts will be necessary to strengthen the progress in
governance, notably to enhance coordination efforts and the analytical coverage o f decentralization.
82. The substantial progress in the social sectors and rural development is likely to continue. Partners’
support to Mauritania during the implementation period o f PRSP-1 enabled progress in education, health,
and rural development. The programmatic approach and the design o f multidonor projects greatly
increased access to education. The PRSP-2 implementation period will target, among other things, the
quality concerns in the sector. During the same period, better coordination o f donor interventions and
better analytical coverage o f the rural sector should enable achieving the country’s objective o f reducing
poverty in rural areas, notably by providing better financing for the livestock sub-sector. In the hydraulic
and sanitation sectors, consultation between the government and the donor community, i f accompanied by
adequate financing, should result in substantial progress.

83. The International Monetary Fund plays a critical role in the country’s macroeconomic
development. IMF assistance to Mauritania i s two-pronged. First, technical assistance and policy advice
in the areas o f Fund expertise (including monetary policy, public finance management, and foreign
exchange reforms) support the authorities’ reform program, aiming at strengthening the institutional
underpinnings o f macroeconomic management. Second, financial assistance under the Poverty Reduction
and Growth Facility (PRGF) has been requested to support the authorities’ medium-term economic and
financial program. This assistance would help Mauritania reach i t s poverty reduction strategy goals by
fostering macroeconomic stability and strengthening the balance o f payments.
84. African Development Bank assistance focuses on roads, water, and microflnance. Specifically the
2002-04 Country Strategy Paper (CSP) targeted improvements in road infrastructure, water supply and
purification, social and economic reform, and institutional support. Over this period, AfDB financed four
structural adjustment lending operations. Other lending comprised: (a) lines o f credit; (b) lending for
institutional support and rehabilitation; and (c) support o f project cycles, including sectoral studies in the
agricultural and water sectors. AfDB’s programs in support o f economic and structural reform were
cofinanced with the World Bank and are included in the annual public expenditure reviews (PERs) o f the
Bank. The recently adopted CSP for 2006-07 focuses o n two pillars: (a) microfmance development; and
(b) improved access to drinking water and sanitation services in rural areas, concentrating on the
improvement o f economic governance and private sector development (PSD).
85. The European Commissionfocuses support on transport and capacity building. The cooperation
between the European Union and Mauritania dates back to 1958 and expresses itself principally in the
form o f European Development Fund financing and implementation o f fishing agreements. The EC’s
Strategy o f Co-operation program covers the period o f 2001-07 and was signed through a partnership
agreement in June 2000. Interventions under the existing program target: (a) transport, including better
national and regional integration (within the Economic Community o f West African States and the Arab

-23

-

Maghreb Union) and access to markets and social services; and (b) capacity building, including
consolidation o f democracy and the constitutional state, respect o f human rights and basic liberties, and
support o f civil society.
86. French assistance is delivered via two distinct channels of cross-cutting and sectoral programs.
French development aid i s implemented both by the Ministry o f Foreign Affairs (cultural and cooperation
department o f the French embassy) and by the French Development Agency (AFD). A framework
document o n partnership (Document Cadre de Purtenariat, or DCP) i s currently being finalized. It will
prioritize the fields o f intervention and the modalities o f French-Mauritanian cooperation for 2006-1 0.
The DCP stipulates that French assistance will focus on (a) cross-cutting programs to improve governance
(economic as well as social and local) and reinforce the French-Mauritanian relationship in cultural,
linguistic, academic, and research matters; and (b) specific sector programs directly related to the MDGs.
The three sectors selected for priority focus are educatiodvocational training, environmenthiodiversity,
and water and sanitation.

87. German technical cooperation is provided through G T Z and financial cooperation through KjW.
German cooperation through these two agencies focuses on two priorities: (a) good governance; and
(b) rural developmenthatural resource management. Focus on good governance includes decentralization
and communal development (including cofinancing the World Bank Urban Development Program, or
PDU), strengthening the National Assembly and the Public Finance Court, and promoting gender equality
for women. Germany also facilitates the election process through technical assistance (TA) to the
National Election Commission (CENT) and contributing to the elections trust fund (TF). The second
program aims to improve sectoral policies on natural resource management through TC and small erosion
control investments in the districts o f Guidimaka and Hodh el Gharbi. The program also supports the
National Parc o f Banc d’Arguin and management o f natural resources in the Senegal River valley.
Germany also assists a program o f fishery resource management, including relief in the field o f fishery
surveillance. The substantial reduction in illegal fishing i s largely attributable to long-term German
technical and finance assistance.
88. The Spanish Agency for International Cooperation works through NGOs. Active in Mauritania
since the early 199Os, A E C I implements projects with the help o f 13 resident Spanish nongovernmental
agencies (NGOs). In 2005, almost 40 Spanish projects were under implementation in Mauritania in
various sectors: education, health, water supply, institutional development, energy, fishing, agriculture,
environment, and gender equality for women. Mauritania i s 1 o f 23 priority countries for A E C I and a new
phase o f Spanish assistance has been launched with a new Country Strategy Document. The two main
strategic objectives are to: (i)
improve living conditions; and (ii)
promote sustainable development that
will protect natural resources. Furthermore, A E C I assistance seeks to support good governance, which
involves civil society and reform o f the justice sector; and basic social needs, including child and
maternal health, illiteracy, vocational training, and safe drinking water.
89. The United Nations System targets country assistance on MDGs. The current United Nations
Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) for Mauritania covers 2003-08 and has been signed by
both the IMF and the World Bank representatives. I t sets U N S priority areas in support o f the MDGs,
including capacity building for the public sector and civil society, promotion o f good governance,
including support to the democratic transition and elections, improved coverage o f basic needs, and
sustainable human development. The November 2005 mid-term review o f the UNDAF included
adjustments to take into account implementation constraints and the new political context. The financial
resources mobilized under the UNDAF amount to an estimated US$98.91 million.”

90. Multiple other donors are involved. Additional donors include Arab funds (such as the Kuwaiti
Fund, Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, and Saudi Fund), the Islamic Development
Bank (IDB), International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), Japan International Cooperation
Agency (JICA), Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), and United States Agency for
International Development ( U S A I D ) , as well as development agencies and international NGOs (World
Vision, OXFAM, and others). All o f them contribute to achieve PRSP-2 and their interventions are
presented in the comprehensive country results matrix (Annex Cl).

D. Proposed Assistance Strategy
1. Bank Positioning
91. The proposed CAS is based on country needs and Bank’s relative added value. T o determine and
adequately target i t s strategy during the CAS preparation, the Bank used analysis o f relative added value
extensively in consultation with the government. These consultations identified which sectors to pursue
and services to offer to respond most appropriately and effectively to country needs. Grounded in the
PRSP-2 and continuous dialogue with the government, the Bank assessed sector needs according to their:
(a) relative financial gap; (b) analytic gap; (c) level o f support needed t o achieve the MDGs; and (d) the
number o f donors in the sector. The Bank expertise in the sector was assessed separately by the Bank
itself and the government along five criteria. In addition, the Bank team used other general criteria to
determine ideal strategic positioning, such as alignment with PRSP-2, with an emphasis on priority
sectors, and coherence with previous positioning and continuity o f interventions. (A detailed note on
related tools and process i s provided in Annex C9.) Finally, the CAS incorporates feedback received
during extensive consultations on the Bank’s Governance and Anti-Comption Strategy.
92. The analysis helped shape and sharpen the Bank’s strategic vision. The preceding analysis o f
comparative advantages and country needs points out four clear priority areas: (a) private sector and basic
infrastructure development, (b) urban development, (c) rural development, and (d) governance, which
encompasses strengthening o f public administration and economic governance. In addition to these areas,
the Bank’s continued strong involvement in the social sectors i s needed, even if these sectors seem less
attractive due to the number o f donors already active in the sector and the absence o f any financial gap.
Indeed, the Bank plays an important catalytic role and has a relatively strong comparative advantage.
Moreover, exit costs are high. The Bank thus will: (a) intensify i t s efforts to improve governance; (b) reengage in the private sector; and (c) continue i t s support in rural and urban development and in the social
sectors to reduce poverty.
93. Priority areas are targeted through both recently approved and new operations. The Bank recently
a Capacity Building Project to enhance
delivered 4 projects to meet four o f these priority needs: (i)
governance; (ii)a Global Environment Facility (GEF) Community-based Watershed Management
Project; (iii)
a Health and Nutrition Support Project; and (iv) an additional financing credit to the Second
Mining Sector Capacity Building Project (PRISM2) to provide TA to the o i l sector. Thus, the CAS
FY08-11 program focuses on the three remaining priority areas: private sector and basic infrastructure
development, education, and urban development. In addition, the Bank will realign the currently
underutilized rural sector portfolio. In addition, complementing the EU’s catalytic role in the transport
sector, the government would appreciate Bank support in this area through relatively small TA. Even
though the Bank’s positioning i s not leading on fisheries (see Annex C9, Figure C9.3), the upcoming
E S W may help to identify specific areas where the Bank can contribute high value added support. Lastly,

- 25 -

development o f joint program approaches in rural development and PSD will leverage Bank funds, help
build capacity in Mauritania’s government, and increase aid effectiveness.

94. Targeted ESW will better address development challenges and target operations. As analytical gaps
remain, the Bank will undertake key studies aligned with the CAS strategic objectives to enhance the
understanding o f development challenges. In particular, regarding PSD and in continuing the recent
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) and the upcoming Investment Climate Assessment (ICA),
the Poverty Reduction and Economic Management (PREM) team will undertake a study o n the Sources
o f Growth. Regarding economic governance, to complement the CEM and the Public Expenditure
Review (PER), the Bank will support government’s efforts to strategically address corruption through an
Anti-Corruption study. Core E S W such as the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability program
(PEFA) will complement the knowledge in this field. Finally, E S W in the rural sector will tackle land
tenure issues, which could become a source o f tension if not addressed properly. The Bank will strive to
undertake these activities jointly with the government and other donors and will disseminate the results
for the benefit o f all partners.

2.

Bank Proposed Strategy

95. The Bank will expand its efforts to improve governance andfight corruption. The Bank will focus
on: (i)
improving public financial management; (ii)
ensuring sound management o f o i l revenues; (iii)
strengthening checks and balance across institutions; (iv) increasing community participation - notably
through third party monitoring o f the Bank portfolio - and (v) building capacity o f civil society
organizations. These priority areas have been identified on the basis o f discussions with government and
consultations with civil society and donors, as well as o n the constraints they pose for the success o f the
PRSP-2 and management o f the reputational and fiduciary risks to the Bank’s work. A number o f
assistance instruments are already in place for the first two priority areas. Financial management reforms
are addressed through the Public Sector Capacity Building Project (PRECASP), an Institutional
Development Fund (IDF) grant on procurement, and non-lending services such as TA to the Treasury and
a variety o f E S W (PER and PEFA). Transparency in the extractive industries i s promoted through the
EITI Trust Fund and the supplemental Oil Sector Capacity Building component o f the second Mining
Sector Project. Governance work in these two key areas i s further supported through an anti-corruption
study. Assistance in the other three areas will be explored.
96. The Bank will re-engage with the private sector. In support o f the first PRSP-2 pillar, the Bank i s
planning a PrivateRinancial Sector Technical Assistance Project which will address the financial and
private sector development issues identified in the recently completed ICA and FSAP. It will focus on
increasing non-oil investment in the economy and o n improving the soundness and efficiency o f the
Mauritanian financial system and provide support to prepare public private partnerships in the energy
sector. The PSD operation will complement the ongoing IDA support through the Second Mining
Capacity Building Project to increase the institutional capacity o f the mining and petroleum sectors and to
optimize the management o f o i l revenues. A new transport project will include the preparation o f a public
private partnership in the port sector. An E S W o n sources o f growth would help t o identify potential
growth sectors. In addition, IBRD funding or partial risk guarantees could be deployed to seize important
opportunities for the port and electricity sub-sectors, through public private partnerships. The Bank’s
intervention will be leveraged by IFC Advisory Services and, possibly with IFC investments and MIGA’s
work with the investment promotion authority.
97. The Bank will continue its catalytic role in rural and urban development as well as in the social
sectors. In support o f the second and third PRSP pillars, the Bank will contribute to reduce poverty in

- 26 -

rural and urban areas as well as to improve quality and access to basic services. Through i t s existing rural
portfolio and a planned ESW on land tenure, the Bank will help diversify and intensify agriculture, and
improve water control and access to land tenure. An existing (first) and second phase o f the PDU will
contribute to improving life in urban areas, enhancing urban development, and preserving ancient sites.
Furthermore, the Bank will help improve the institutional environment o f the education sector and the
access and quality o f primary, secondary, and tertiary education and vocational training through the
existing (first) and second phase o f the multi-donor Education Sector Development Program (PNDSE)
and the Higher Education project. A recently approved Health and Nutrition project supports an increase
in access to health services, quality o f maternal health services, and H I V / A I D S treatment services.

3.

Financing under Constraints

98. I n light of limited I D A resources, additional funding options and instruments are to be explored
First, IDA will explore alternative instruments such as budget support, notably in the health sector; IDA
guarantees; and Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), especially in the infrastructure sector. Second, IDA,
I F C and MIGA will coordinate in order to ensure that all their respective instruments better leverage
Bank’s intervention. MIGA can mitigate perceived political r i s k s o f private sector projects and work
directly with investment-promotion agencies to increase FDI flows. MIGA also i s supporting PPPs to
improve project implementation. Although there i s a notional limit o f MIGA’s involvement in any country
o f US$420 million, it i s not an effective constraint. Extensive collaboration with IFC, which provides
financing to the private sector and advisory services to Government and private operators, will enable the
Bank to increase i t s PSD impact. Finally, the Mauritanian Government has applied for financing from the
Africa Catalytic Growth Fund (ACGF) to supplement the currently modest IDA14 program.
99. Two factors account for a limited scope of new I D A financing over the CASperiod, spanning
F Y 0 8 - F Y l l . The first factor i s that Mauritania benefited from debt relief under the MDRI. This debt
relief represents a net financial gain to the Government and a predictable flow o f sharply reduced
payments on multilateral obligations. However, the initiative has implications for Mauritania’s IDA
envelope, since the country’s forgone IDA debt service in any given year will be deducted from i t s
performance-based annual IDA allocation. As a result, Mauritania’s future IDA envelope can be
expected to decrease along with those o f other IDA MDRI recipients, and planning for the future IDA
program will have to take this into consideration. A second factor that limits financing in FY08 i s that
IDA resources were significantly frontloaded in FY06 and FY07 to finance the Health, Petroleum
Capacity Building and Public Sector Capacity Building Projects, as well as two regional projects.
100. The proposed CAS has identified a range of potential assistance over the next four years. Within
this range, the CAS provides a flexible description o f the Bank’s potential support for Mauritania,
depending upon the level o f financing available. Future IDA allocations, beyond FY07, are indicative
only at this stage. Actual lending limits in IDA are determined annually and will depend on: (i)
the
country’s performance as assessed annually by the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA)
and the Bank’s Annual Report on Portfolio Performance; (ii)
i t s performance relative to the performance
the amount o f overall resources available to IDA during the I D A 1 4 and
o f other IDA countries; (iii)
IDA15 replenishment periods; (iv) changes in the l i s t o f active IDA-eligible countries; and (v) the terms
(grants or loans) for which Mauritania qualifies under the I D A 1 4 grant eligibility and allocation
framework.
101. The base case level of financing outlines a relatively low notional allocation for IDA15. T h i s
allocation i s in line with the I D A 1 4 level o f resources net o f MDRI ($27.71 million) and incorporates
Mauritania’s latest D S A which shows it at moderate risk o f debt distress and therefore eligible for

-27

-

receiving 50 percent grants from IDA as per the IDA grants framework. I t assumes that Mauritania's
allocation in FY08 would be in line with i t s FY07 allocation, which would not provide any additional
funding for IDA14 beyond the amounts already frontloaded into F Y 0 6 and FY07; and that n o IBRD
funds would be available during the latter part o f the CAS period. In the base case, the Bank will not
approve any new operations until FY09 and will only re-engage with small scale projects in the three
mentioned priority sectors (FinanceFSD, Transport TA, Education and Urban) unless other sources o f
funding will become available such as Catalyhc Funds or co-financing with other donors.
102. A higher level of funding may be feasible, given the scope for improvement in Mauritania's
Country Performance Rating. Should improvements to the CPR lead to additional IDA resources
available for commitment in FY08, the Bank would seek to re-engage with the private sector with a
FinanceFSD project. With a higher level o f IDA resources in FYO8, a substantial re-engagement o f IFC
would also be possible. In addition, higher allocations in I D A 1 5 than under the base-case financing could
open up the scope for the Bank to implement all elements o f the above-mentioned strategy with a full
reengagement in the p r i v a t e h a n c i a l sector (additional financing for this project), adequately funded
Second Phase Education and Urban Projects, a continued presence in the transport sector through modest
TA and, in addition, a modest allocation for the Health Project.
103. The possibility of IBRD enclave financing will also be explored. Under current projections,
Mauritania i s expected to cross the FY07 IDA operational cut-off o f US$1,025 GNI per capita towards
the end o f this CAS period in FY10. The possibility to use limited IBRD to support private enclave
projects will thus be explored. These loans are available for IDA countries under a certain number o f
criteria regarding the level o f risks. Projects applying for such funds must thus be designed to limit the
exposure o f the Bank, which can be the case in infrastructure and productive sectors.
104. Furthermore, the country may access IBRD blend status over the long term. During the CAS
period, Mauritania's GNI per capita may exceed the IDA operational cut-off point. While this i s not
expected to affect Mauritania's eligibility for IDA financing during the CAS period, at the country's
request, the Bank may perform a creditworthiness assessment to determine the country's eligibility for
borrowing from BRD.
105. The strategy for the use of the resources in this lending range has been discussed and agreed
with the Government. This i s summarized in Table 5, which presents a thorough analysis o f the strengths,
weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) related to each financing option - a base case o f U S 2 5
million equivalent and an optimistic case o f up to US$36 million equivalent (with the possibility, in
addition, o f IBRD enclave financing).

assumed for FY08 and the IDA-15 period is similar to the level available to Mauritania during the IDA-14 period. Given
the scope for improvement in Mauritania's performance, the more optimistic case sets out a potential program for
Mauritania should its allocation be higher. As described in the text, the actual IDA financing envelope for the CAS period is
determined annually based on the performance-based allocation system.
In the base-case, FY08 reflects 0 IDA amount due to significant frontloading in FY06 and FY07.

Collaborative CAS Strategic Objectives
106. Selective in nature, the Bank strategy addresses key country challenges and areas of highest
impact. In collaboration with other donors and in continued dialogue with the government, the Bank i s
responding to the country’s overall development challenges (see sections IV.B and IV.C) and long-term
PRSP-2 objectives. The proposed Bank strategy itself pursues a very selective approach, based o n core
competencies as well as limited funding, to focus interventions in key areas in which the Bank can
contribute the most. I t must be noted that some o f the objectives put forth will be reached only if adequate
levels o f finding become available during the CAS period.

4.

Addressing Cross-Cutting Challenges

107. To avoid the “resource curse,” promote transparent management of natural wealth. Sound
macroeconomic management i s needed to correct fiscal imbalances, contain inflation, and pursue a
competitive real exchange rate to avoid Dutch disease and balance the external account through the long
term. The accumulation o f o i l revenues in the FNHR also can strengthen the transparency o f revenue
flows and thereby curb rent-seeking and corruption. Achieving these results will be greatly supported by
the authorities implementing the EITI, which eases pressure for over-rapid deployment by limiting
speculation on the scale o f the revenue flow. Improvements o n the FNHR and EITI fronts are important
but need to be followed up by broader action. For instance, building national capacity and making sure
that national o i l companies, such as the Mauritanian Hydrocarbon Company (SMH), do not become
“states within states” are also important determinants o f a successful o i l revenue management policy. At
the same time, Dutch disease can be limited by increasing the diversification o f the economy.
108. Facilitate Mauritania ’s regional integration. The ongoing water resources and environmental
management project provides the strategic framework to address environmental transboundary issues as
well as to enhance institutional capacity and strengthen stakeholders’ participation. Building from these
results, the approved Multipurpose Water Resources Development (MWRD) program will consolidate
and modernize regional and national water resource institutions and launch ambitious, multipurpose
income-generation activities associated with reducing waterborne diseases. Moreover, the MWRD will
assist Mauritania and the riparian countries o f the Senegal River basin to strategically plan the
development o f regional water resources. The regional agenda i s further enhanced with the development
o f hydropower opportunities by the Organization for the Development o f the Senegal River’s (OMVS)
second generation o f dams. Mauritania will gain substantial benefits from the O M V S dams. The
development o f the Felou and Guinea Hydro-Electric Power (HEP) will be funded under the West Africa
Power Pool (WAPP).
109. Assist in reaching more equitable growth and reducing social tensions. In response to earlier
discussed challenges, a “dual-track’’ strategy i s proposed to help reduce inequality in the country, notably
between urban and rural zones. Track 1 aims at revitalizing a dynamic market economy in the rural
sector, while Track 2 promotes cross-cutting reforms o f the largely rent-driven urban economy. The
transfer o f increasing fractions o f rent from powerful networks into market-guided wealth creation could
stimulate more equitable growth in the future. The Bank will also seek to address the inequality issue by
encouraging the reform o f land tenure on the basis o f the findings o f analytical studies, providing
assistance in establishing a skills-based human resource management system in the public administration,
and formulating an E S W on social protection policy in urban areas, with a view to informing a social

-30-

protection strategy. The implementation o f such strategy would be particularly important, given that there
i s evidence that the family-based social safety net system i s increasingly coming under strain.

110. Help to enhance human resource capacity. The PNDSE and Higher Education Project will help
the government meet i t s goals in human capacity development through assistance in: (a) improving the
quality o f teaching and the learning environment and the relevance o f courses to the labor market; and
(b) establishing pedagogic, administrative, and financial management systems and enhanced capacity in
the institutions o f higher education. The Bank’s intervention also will address some o f the needs in
professional and vocational training. The Vocational and Technical Training component o f the Education
Sector Development Program (PNDSE) intends to improve the relevance and external efficiency o f
vocational and technical training by making them more responsive to market demands by establishing a
Technical and Vocational Training Fund (TVTF) and reinforcing their institutional framework.
111. Promote capacity building in all forms through comprehensive implementation of the CDMAP.
The C A S grants high importance to capacity building, which i s crucial to ensure good governance and
thus mitigate unscheduled political transition risks. In addition to providing assistance in developing s k i l l s
for growth and competitiveness through i t s support to tertiary education and vocational training, the Bank
will help build capacity in four other ways. I t will contribute to: (a) improving public finance
management; (b) supporting the government in leading public systems reform; (c) aligning the CAS and
PRSP and strengthening M&E capacities o f the country; and (d) harmonizing donor support to capacity
development, for instance by participating in multi-donor projects in education, public sector reform and
economic governance. The next section (V.E. “Addressing challenges by pillar”) describes more precisely
the related operations and assistance and their detailed strategic objectives.
112. Support governmentpolicies that target reduction in gender gaps. T o promote equality, the Bank
will review gender and growth linkages in the Country Economic Memorandum (CEM). It also will
tackle gender dimensions o f private sector development, land tenure and social protection to strengthen
the strong productive potential o f women and increase their rights awareness as well as access to
employment and economic activities. In addition, the Bank will draw on the experience o f the judiciary
IDF grant and the Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF) program to address gender concerns in legal
reform and governance, with the specific goal o f improving women’s legal status and protecting their
rights. The Bank will promote infrastructure investments that reduce women’s labor burden, address
gender dimensions o f poverty in the planned Poverty Assessment, improve data collection and analysis,
and provide institutional support at the national and decentralized levels. Planned Bank programs will
also help improve communication and information-sharing among donors and with government o n gender
issues and serve as a catalyst for involving other donors in better applying gender tools at the national,
regional and local levels.

5.

Addressing Challenges by Pillar

Pillar 1. Accelerate growth and maintainmacroeconomic equilibrium

113. Help increase economic growth potential and optimize oil revenue management. Through the
PRECASP and E S W programs (such as the CEM), the Bank will provide support to the government in
identifying and implementing structural reforms and macroeconomic policies for improving the external
position o f the country. In addition, through supplemental financing o f the PRISM2 and the EITI Trust
Fund (TF), the Bank will support the government to define and set up a policy for the petroleum sector
and update i t s legal and regulatory framework. In addition to the TA provided to draft the o i l revenue
management system and the macroeconomic framework, these actions should help establish an

-31 -

appropriate fiscal budgetary policy and transparent management o f the extra revenues to benefit future
generations.

114. Promote private sector-driven, export-oriented growth. Proximity to European markets and
relatively l o w labor costs constitute major assets to reinforce the country’s private sector-led growth for
poverty reduction, income generation, and employment opportunities, In proceeding to implement i t s
national reform strategy, the government can “jump start” economic growth and channel i t s benefits to the
poor. Conditions to unleash this potential include: (a) having a clear reform agenda to reduce the costs o f
doing business; (b) streamlining business taxation, in both number o f taxes and administration;
(c) supporting the development o f small and medium enterprises through improved competition,
increased access to finance, linkages, and cluster programs; (d) reforming the legal and regulatory
framework and enhancing the performance o f the judicial system to inspire confidence to businesses by
strengthening contract enforcement and credit collections; (e) encouraging public-private partnerships for
improved infrastructure service; and ( f ) supporting s k i l l s and firm capacity improvement. T o provide
adequate support to this agenda, the Bank private sector project team will explore possible analytical
work on crucial concerns such as: (i)S M E clusters development and linkages with the o i l sector;
(ii)
investment incentives, property rights and competition; and (iii)
labor market and skills issues.
115. Strengthen the financial sector’s regulation and judicial framework. Bank interventions will seek
to increase access to financial services and improve the business environment through legal and judicial
reform o f the business and credit environment. Based on the findings o f the FSAP, the ICA, and other
ESW, including the Sources o f Growth study, the Bank i s preparing an operation to address these
challenges. This operation will be part o f a national financial and private sector reform program in which
other financiers including I F C and MIGA can fit as needed. The program will have four components:
(a) private sector reform; (b) financial services reform; (c) business legal, institutional, and judiciary
environment reform; and (d) capacity building. The program will improve the quality o f financial services
to better contribute to private-sector-led growth in a sound business-enabling environment with increased
access to basic financial services.
116. Use Bank Group synergies to catalyze private sector growth. The Bank’s strategy provides for
using the full range o f services supplemented by IFC and by MIGA toward: (a) a banking system with
self-sustaining institutions o f industrial and commercial groups; (b) an efficient and reliable payment
system; (c) a reinforced insurance sector; (d) a sustainable and dynamic microfinance system; (e) an
improved legal and regulatory framework; and ( f ) an effective regulation and supervision o f all financial
institutions. Furthermore, both IFC and MIGA are prepared to provide TA for capacity building (for
example, to promote FDI), as well as to develop SMEs, notably through MIGA’s recently created Small
Investor Program. I F C and MIGA will consider potential support to any suitable private operator chosen
for the Nouakchott airport and the ports o f Nouakchott and Nouadhibou. B o t h also could bring in
additional expertise and investments in the telecommunications sector, if needed. Together with the Bank,
IFC and MIGA will reinforce the dialogue with the government toward increasing private sector
participation in the economy.
117. Help unleash thepotential of thefisheries sector. The Bank will first carry out an E S W to help the
government (a) identify the additional value added from the fisheries sector that could be captured by the
country, as well as the governance reforms and infrastructure investments necessary to achieve this
growth; and (b) outline a roadmap for the implementation o f resource management plans to ensure the
sustainability o f the resource base. The E S W would help prepare a sound business case for possible Bank
intervention and could provide the analytical basis for support to, first, strengthen resource management
through a regional sustainable fisheries project for West Africa, financed in part by the existing GEF
US$60m Strategic Partnership Fund. Given the tight IDA envelope, Mauritania would participate through
possible IBRD financing. Second, support would go to improve sector infrastructure for value added,

- 32 -

such as ports, through both possible IBRD financing and linkages to IFC and MIGA investments and
guarantees as may be necessary to leverage private sector investment. These efforts also would contribute
to, and be reinforced by, the Bank’s broader support for governance reforms and improved
macroeconomic planning.

118. Contribute to infrastructure development through, inter alia, possible IBRD enclave funding.
Through a Transport TA project, the Bank will work closely with the EU and other partners in supporting
the Government’s ongoing reforms o f the transport sector. In addition, it will explore the use o f an
enclave structure to support specific private sector projects that have an important development impact
and require critical government involvement. Such operations would need to be carefully structured to
provide appropriate risk sharing with the private sector and to leverage Bank involvement to mobilize
substantial private resources. The operations also would need to be designed to minimize the risk to the
Bank and help generate resources for development. Indeed, such enclave financing could be deployed to
seize important opportunities in financing infrastructure, in particular for the port and electricity subsectors. Furthermore, strengthening the Bank’s position in the private sector will enable it to develop IFC
activities.
Pillar 2. Anchor growth in the economic environment of the poor

119. Help formulate a comprehensive rural development strategy. The Bank rural strategy, currently
under preparation in parallel to the overall sector review conducted by the government, should highlight
both the economic dimension and the social perspective o f rural development in Mauritania. Both
dimensions are important for the country’s economic growth and sociaVpolitica1 stability on the longer
run. A significant increase o f rural sector contribution to economic growth will only happen through:
(i)
well-targeted investments in the irrigated agriculture along the valley promoting crop diversification
and attracting more private sector involvement; and (ii)
direct support to livestock productivity. The
social aspect o f the rural strategy will underline the need for continuous support to rural poor living in
rain-fed areas through expansion o f social infrastructures, investments in rural roads, and direct transfer o f
funds to poor rural communities, including through access to microfinance. This will prevent the
marginalization o f the sector and rural poor.

120. Focus on concrete opportunities and weaknesses that hamper rural development. In promoting
agricultural diversification and integrating the livestock sector in the economy, the Bank’s rural strategy
proposes to focus on productivity and competitiveness, and on providing rural infrastructure (roads,
electricity, coolinglstorage facilities, and irrigation). The strategy would also concentrate on resolving
long-lasting institutional constraints by undertaking: (i)enhanced agricultural services to producers
(extension and rural training programs); (ii)
improved agricultural research, adapted to evolving farmers’
conditions and closely linked to extension, to increase productivity; (iii)land tenure reform for more
secure property rights to foster private sector development; and (iv) agricultural policies, particularly
input and output trade-related issues. The strategy would also focus o n decentralization and local
development with concrete steps to transfer public funds to local communities, encouraging their effective
participation, ensuring more transparency in funds management, and promoting ownership o f local
development processes.
121. Advise on resolving structural problems of the rural sector. The World Bank currently finances
four operations in rural development, for a total IDA amount o f about US$lOO million. These operations
aim at improving access to irrigated land, drinking water and basic infrastructure, supporting technology
transfer to producers; and promoting an environmental and social approach for sustainable development.
Together, these operations support the government’s objectives o f improved food security and
agricultural growth through locust control, increased agricultural productivity, and improved producers’
and rural entrepreneurs’ access to finance. The implementation o f these projects coincides with the

- 33 -

upcoming CAS and the PRSP-2 (FY07-FY 11). Consequently, the Bank’s rural sector support strategy
during this period will be to maximize the use o f the existing resources to address the challenges facing
rural development in the most effective way and explore readjustments o f the existing operations and
possible ESW.
122. Focus urban development on improving employment opportunities and living conditions. The
first results o f the Urban Development Program (PDU) show that a sustained and long-term focus o n
urban development can significantly reduce the incidence o f poverty and i t s attendant inequality.
Activities were targeted at the poorest districts to improve access to land, shelter, basic social services,
and infrastructure. The Bank will continue to contribute to the urban development agenda through:
(a) improving urban management by supporting the set-up o f a sound judicial framework governing land
and urban planning; (b) increasing the provision o f infrastructure and service delivery, particularly in
periurban districts; (c) strengthening decentralization by ensuring sustainable mechanisms for
intergovernmental transfers o f financial and human resources toward municipalities (through a
contractual approach with municipalities ensuring a greater mobilization and accountability o f actors) and
by building the capacities o f the local stakeholders; and (d) improving the capacity o f the construction
sector in collaboration with other projects and partners.
Pillar 3. Develop human resources and generalize access to basic social services

123. Strengthen the quality of education infrastructure from primary to vocational levels. The country
strategy focus i s to continue developing the Education For All (EFA) agenda with specific attention to the
quality o f basic education (completion and learning achievements) to generate spill-over effects o n
poverty reduction and promotion o f women. At the same time, the Bank plans to explore secondary and
higher education issues to make this strategy sustainable. The reform o f the country’s vocational training
and technical education policy i s also urgent to respond to rapidly evolving labor market demands. This
multipronged approach requires the government to: (a) adapt the legal framework to improve the use o f
vocational training and to enable the private sector to invest in training; (b) improve labor monitoring to
provide orientations for the sector; (c) develop apprenticeship programs for youth; and (d) develop
professional and vocational training. The Bank i s supporting this strategic framework through the
ongoing Higher Education Project and the second and proposed third phases o f the PNDSE, which will
leverage multidonor financing-provided by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF),
AFD, and
AfDB-to support the government strategy.
124. Continue to focus on improving access to health, nutrition, and social services. With the FY07
IDA-funded Health and Nutrition Support Project (scheduled to close o n December 3 1, 2009), there i s a
need to prepare a new operation in the sector one year earlier to ensure continuity and avoid a funding
gap, as was experienced in 2005-06. This new operation should probably have a two-pronged approach:
(i)continuing ongoing actions while (ii)
preparing for a changing epidemiological profile to reflect the
new economic situation facing the country. I t i s also important to increase work on the financial
sustainability o f the sector to ensure that public health priorities are underpinned by fiscally sustainable
domestic financing and accompanying institutional reforms. The Bank will also explore the possibility o f
raising a trust fund to address population issues.
125. Continue to support the improvement of water and sanitation access. The World Bank does not
envision specific new projects in the water and sanitation sector. However, the ongoing PDU, which
focuses on the urban environment, the Community-Based Rural Program (PDRC) in rural areas, and the
PRISM in the northern mining zone will continue to provide resources to improve water access. Some
institutional funds could also be mobilized, in particular to help the government develop a public-private
partnership in the sector and to attract other donors.

- 34 -

Pillar 4. Improve good governance and capacity building

126. Help improve human resources management. The government recently embraced the idea o f
public administration reform, including the implementation o f modem management tools. Bank
assistance will help to: (a) develop an adequate and transparent hiring and evaluation system; (b) review
the salary matrix; (c) modernize the outdated centralized and poorly adapted model o f human resources
system; and (d) put in place an effective control system o f the volume and contractual status o f
employees. The Bank will provide i t s support to the government through the PRECASP, in close
coordination with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and UNDP.
127. Promote transparent public resource management. T o reach this outcome, the Bank will support
the establishment o f tools and procedures for efficient and transparent management o f public resources.
These tools will particularly emphasize: (a) revenue mobilization; (b) procurement; (c) budget planning
and execution; (d) accounting; and (e) alignment o f PRSP-2, MTEF, and the budget. The Bank will
provide support to the government through the multi-donor PRECASP and will collaborate with France,
UNDP, UNFPA, and GTZ. PRECASP aims at implementing the key recommendations o f the 2003
Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) and the Report on the Observance o f Standards
and Codes (ROSC), and the 2006 PER update with new data and progress made. The PRECASP project
will also be a tool to monitor the implementation o f procurement reform. Besides, in cooperation with
other donors, the Bank will explore ways to strengthen areas where there i s currently a breakdown o f
oversight and accountability. The PRECASP project i s a potential tool to address internal control and
audit functions (such as those performed by the IGE and IGF). Additional resources could be mobilized to
work with government and audit agencies o n better addressing corruption. The Bank also plans to
produce a PFM Performance Report, using PEFA indicators, in FY09.
128. Support implementation of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. The government
recently embraced EITI to better manage revenues from the o i l and mining sectors. Supported in i t s
implementation through Bank-managed trust funds, EITI will put the o i l and mining sectors under
stronger public scrutiny and thereby strengthen acc~untability'~.
EITI calls for companies to disclose all
their payments and for the state to disclose the corresponding receipts. EITI reports will focus on
reconciling accounts and explaining any discrepancies. The reports will also help citizens understand
whether the benefits from o i l extraction are being reaped by the host country. The participation o f civil
society in this process i s o f vital importance to validate the process. Any and all MIGA and I F C projects
to be supported in the o i l sector-including MIGA's possible guarantee for Woodside-will conform to
EITI and extractive industries review criteria, if not exceed such requirements.
129. Strengthen revenue management and transparency in the extractive industries beyond EITI.
Petroleum sector management i s implemented comprehensively, including various stakeholders, thus
putting in place the "checks-and-balances" system. The World Bank provides assistance through three
mechanisms: (i)Additional Financing Credit to the Second Mining Sector Capacity Building Project;
(ii)
EITI; and (iii)
assistance to the Central Bank. Furthermore, the IMF i s closely involved in advising the
government on o i l revenue management, National Hydrocarbon Fund activities, and fiscal implications;
and i s cooperating closely with the Bank in the process. The Bank i s also coordinating closely with other
donors active in o i l revenue management in Mauritania-especially the Islamic Development Bank and
NORAD.
130. Actively promote the fight against corruption. A Technical Committee4omprising main donors,
government agencies, and civil society-has
been created specifically to promote this fight. The
committee will produce a policy note focusing on four priority areas: (a) public administration,
Is

The first audit (2005) covered mining only, because oil production started in 2006.

- 35 -

(b) extractive industries, (c) rule o f law, and (d) socio-cultural aspects o f corruption. This note has served
as an input to the elaboration o f the National Anti-Corruption Strategy. The Bank’s AAA program could
include further activities to help produce, on a regular basis, high quality information on incidence,
direction, costs, and consequences o f corruption in Mauritania, in partnership with international and local
research organizations. The authorities have also taken concrete steps to stamp out money laundering and
address terrorism concerns by enacting L a w 2005-048, which criminalizes both money laundering and
terrorist financing (AMLLFT), and L a w 2005-047, which criminalizes terrorism. T o further strengthen
the AML/CFT system, the Bank will explore solutions to support the establishment o f a Financial
Intelligence Unit (CANIF), to reinforce BCM supervisory capacities, and to train the Judiciary on
AML/CFT.
13 1. Strengthen decentralization as a tool for a more equitable distribution of benefits. Coordination
with other donors i s seen as a key factor to ensure that ongoing Bank-financed operations, such as PDRC,
PDU, and PRECASP, will support the formulation o f a roadmap for the implementation o f Mauritania’s
decentralization program. Considering the rapid economic changes caused by revenues from o i l
production, it i s particularly important to foster initiatives at the village and community levels that
discourage unproductive clientelism and ensure that economic benefits reach the poor. Bank-financed
operations in support o f decentralization will center on Community-Driven Development (CDD)
programs, such as the Community-Based Rural Program (PDRC). Such programs have been instrumental
in both o i l and non-oil-producing countries for building social capital, encouraging local initiatives,
strengthening capacity, and establishing efficient financing mechanisms.
132. Support community participation and the strengthening of civil society capacity. The Bank will
reinforce the dialogue with civil society through a consultation framework. I t s objectives are to:
(a) strengthen the dialogue o n the Bank’s operational policies and strategy; (b) improve civil society
organizations’ (CSOs) capacity to promote public consensus and local ownership o f development policies
through periodic “brainstorming sessions”; (c) enhance the involvement o f CSOs in the Bank’s
operational tasks and portfolio monitoring; and (d) improve CSOs’ communication capacities. Among
others, CSOs will play an active role in the preparation o f the anticorruption ESW. The Bank also will
provide technical and financial support through i t s small grant program and the Global Distance Learning
Network (GDLN). The GDLN will provide training, video conferencing facilities, an internet portal, and
global dialogue for the civil society to enhance i t s professional expertise. GDLN will work in close
cooperation with the UNDP and the EU, which will lead a €4.5 million civil society partnership project.
Pillar 5. Reinforce strategic oversight of programs, monitoring, evaluation, and coordination

133. Strengthen the implementation and M&E capacity of PRSP-2. So far, the Bank has been
encouraged by the former MAED’s strong commitment to implement the large and exhaustive PRSP-2
results framework. However, data collection and analytical tools have not been put in place yet to ensure
appropriate monitoring. To this end, the Bank and the other donors will help the new MEF strengthen i t s
M&E capacity. They will support, through ad hoc TA, MEF’s efforts to establish a centralized and
computerized M&E system for operations and to institute a reliable process to monitor the
implementation o f the PRSP. The PRECASP will support the integration o f the existing monitoring
platforms (Sysfin, Sypsim, and Rachad) for better coordination, increased efficiency and data integrity.
Bank TA will complement the PRECASP support by linking MEF’s monitoring tools to the ones
developed within the Bank. In addition, UNDP, in close consultation with the Bank, finances TA to help
the MEF define an action plan for implementing the Paris Declaration o n Aid Effectiveness.
134. Improve weak data availability and government capacity. T o resolve Mauritania’s data availability
issues and to improve coordination among the country’s main producers o f statistics and users, the
government must make a high-level commitment to the elaboration o f a statistical master plan. The

-36-

Statistical Capacity Building Trust Fund (TF-SCB) will support the elaboration o f this new plan to
develop the national statistical system. The fund will finance the assessment o f progress made in recent
years under an initial plan, identify weaknesses in priority sectors, and identify needs in capacity building
and institutional reform. The statistical master plan will address the capacity building issues to improve
the availability o f statistics in all sectors, produce an activity program, and produce a financial plan for i t s
implementation. The Bank’s efforts will j o i n other donors’ initiatives such as the IMF’s General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS) and macroeconomic training program; EU and European bilateral donors,
AfDB support to the development o f statistical master plans and harmonization o f the consumer price
index, U S A l D support to demography and health statistics, and UN agencies’ support to develop statistics
for labor and child and women health.
135. Support PRSP-2 efforts to implement a detailed M&E system. T o ensure a coherent monitoring
framework, the M&E system envisioned by the Bank proposes to link priority actions to intermediate
outcomes and final results. The reporting will be facilitated by tracking development spending through
the recently introduced functional classification o f the budget and automation o f the expenditure chain.
The Bank will take additional steps in helping to link priority actions to the MTEF and budgeting
processes when costing o f MDGs i s available. T h i s effort will build on a 2005 UNDP study o n the costing
o f MDGs, which was technically reviewed by the UN Millennium Project and validated by the former
MAED and other interested parties.

E. Results-Based CAS Monitoring and Evaluation
136. The CAS M&E design parallels that of PRSP-2. The M&E process that was defined during the
CAS preparation period, for both the Bank and the government (through PRSP-2 implementation), will
permit a close monitoring o f outcomes. The Results Matrix was built following a process that ensured
close alignment o f the CAS with country objectives and results, and focused on Bank contributions and
accountability. For each PRSP objective, Bank interventions that will contribute directly to i t s
achievement were identified. The next step was to identify the expected outcomes and related milestones
(progress indicators) to be achieved along the way. To ensure adequate review o f Bank contributions
toward Mauritania’s development, the proposed C A S distinguishes between results and related activities
under the Bank’s control versus those controlled by others. I t uses a “ f i l l results matrix” for donor and
government engagement o n overall country goals and a “reduced results matrix’’ for management o f the
Bank’s own strategy and portfolio.
137. A sound CAS implementation monitoring system is in place. Monitoring CAS implementation will
be done through a table that will comprise: (a) the l i s t o f CAS results and intermediate outcomes as listed
in the CAS Results Matrix; (b) a “scorecard” column that rates the progress made toward each result; and
(c) a column describing the actual progress o f the results achievement, as stated in the Implementation
Status Report (ISRs, for the lending operations) or in the Aide-Mkmoires (for non-lending activities).
Each quarter, the Country Team (CT) members will validate the data and rating for each CAS result
falling under their respective sectors. If relevant data i s not available in the ISR, the information will be
generated by the projects’ M&E systems which will be relying on project surveys and/or the national
statistical system. All o f these indicators will be consolidated by the portfolio’s monitoring system
developed by the former MAED at the Mauritania Development Gateway to produce the table described
above. This table will be appended to the portfolio quarterly report. Furthermore, the government and IEG
will carry out the evaluation o f the project outcomes, as presented in the Implementation Completion and
Results Report (ICR), and ad hoc IEG country evaluations. These ICRs will serve as inputs for the
evaluation o f the CAS impact.

- 37 -

138. Implementation progress will be reviewed regularly with all key actors. The follow-up on CAS
implementation will be carried out through regular progress updates at various levels: (a) a “portfolio
group” meets monthly to update the indicators and ensure data integrity; and (b) the portfolio quarterly
report includes an Annex dedicated to the CAS and provides MEF, project teams and the Country Team
with updated information on the portfolio implementation progress (lending and AAA) and thus o n the
overall CAS execution. T h i s report i s reviewed through quarterly mini-Country Portfolio Progress
Reviews (CPPRs) organized with MEF, relevant sectoral ministries, and partners. The reviews focus on
specific problems that CAS implementation may be facing and enable corrective actions to be taken
quickly. Each year, one CPPR will focus on C A S results and execution.
139. The Bank should set an example for transparency and accountability by actively involving civil
society in the portfolio monitoring process. Such an approach could both have a powerful demonstration
effect on other donors and the government, and reduce the reputational and fiduciary risks for the Bank. It
would also respond to feedback received at the recent G A C consultations to strengthen civil society
involvement. Building on the strengthened portfolio management initiatives already put in place, it would
produce and disclose regionally disaggregated
require agreeing with the implementing agencies to: (i)
input, output, results and service delivery information for all Bank-financed projects; (ii)
contract with
selected NGOs/academic institutions to monitor grassroots inputs, outputs, and service delivery against
disclose and widely disseminate information.
targets; and (iii)
140. Systems automation will facilitate M&E implementation at all levels. Automation o f the data
collection processes and the use o f computerized systems and networks to monitor C A S execution are
necessary to ensure the integrity, transparency, and accuracy o f data analysis. The overall CAS M&E
system focuses on increasing data capacity, integration, and validation of: (a) MEF’s external aid
monitoring system (to track donor-financed project implementation and consolidate the financial data);
(b) the Bank portfolio M&E system (integrating the M&E tools o f Bank-financed projects); and (c) the
CO monitoring system. Concretely, the system will automatically extract project data from the Bank’s
internal database system (Business Warehouse and ISRs). It will consolidate this information with the
outputs from projects’ M&E systems to automatically generate portfolio reports and scorecards on CAS
execution.

V. MITIGATING R I S K S
141. Recent changes and developmentspose risks that need to be mitigated. Sustaining the momentum
o f Mauritania’s recent political and economic reform efforts and managing these developments carefully
will be critical for the successful implementation o f the proposed country assistance strategy over the
coming years.
142. Reform pace could naturally slow down upon the new government taking office but political
risks are generally considered low. Following the peaceful coup o f August 2005, the transition
government committed itself to a promising roadmap o f democracy, justice, and governance. This path i s
expected to continue under the new government that has been an engaged partner since taking office in
April 2007. Naturally, the election process and following hand-over can lead to a slow down o f reform
efforts already underway. Additionally, new experiences with democratic debates and civil society
engagement may lead to delays in pursuing new directions. However, the political risk i s generally
considered l o w due to strong cooperation and extensive dialogue throughout the transition process with
all partners involved in the country and the donor community. T o ensure continuity in commitments, the
Bank will support the government through a two-step Consultative Group process with initial
consultations having been held before the presidential elections and a full CG planned at the end o f 2007.
First discussions have been promising in the continuation o f the reform path. There i s little risk that the
PRSP will be altered or not implemented, having been developed in close consultation with donors and
the civil society. The same i s true for the CAS itself, which i s closely aligned with the strategic
framework o f the PRSP. Remaining risk will be addressed through continued dialogue and coordination
with all partners and stakeholders. This approach i s reinforced by the decision to present the new CAS
strategy to the Board after the elections and consultations with the new government have taken place to
ensure continued ownership. Likewise, other bilateral partners have discussed their respective assistance
strategies with the new government. Beyond close coordination, targeted analytical work will help
identify development challenges and the costs o f not moving forward with the reform agenda.
143, Authorities must be prepared to mitigate the economy’s vulnerability to external shocks. Lowerthan-projected export growth, caused by lower o i l production, reduced yields from overexploited
fisheries, or shocks to the mining sector could be particularly damaging. Climatic shocks are also a
constant menace to both agriculture and fisheries in Mauritania. The authorities need to pursue prudent
policies over the medium and long terms to build resilience to such shocks. In particular, long-term debt
sustainability critically hinges on the ability to appropriately restrain the fiscal position in response to
shrinking o i l revenues and to save financial resources for the post-oil period. Mauritania’s situation also
will require a careful borrowing strategy. The Bank will continue to advise the government on this
throughout the C A S implementation.
144. Transition to Middle Income Country status is uncertain, and WB support could be insufficient
to help on the way. Given i t s recent political and economic changes, Mauritania could move to Middle
Income Country (MIC) status. However, the country’s Human Development Index stands currently at
only 153 o f 177 countries. Uncertain economic prospects from o i l production as well as continued
vulnerabilities to external shocks could render MIC prospects premature. Continued support from the
donor community will be critical in assisting the country to realize this upward trend and, under current
financing constraints, the Bank may not be able to help as much as needed. Therefore, the new CAS
proposes to focus efforts on: (a) continued dialogue with authorities and country stakeholders; (b) more
selective interventions; (c) efficient program implementation to increase country policy and institutional
assessment (CPIA) ratings and, in return, IDA financing; (c) fostering collaboration to leverage external
funding; and (d) exploring the use o f IBRD enclave funding, as well as direct private investment and
financial markets.

145. Public financial management must be enhanced to mitigate fiduciary risks. Public financial
management s t i l l suffers from: (a) lack o f collection o f tax revenue, particularly at the decentralized level;
(b) l o w overall level o f resources (staff, equipment, and operating expenses) in all three principal audit
bodies, causing them to be unable to fulfill their mandates; (c) absence o f any Mauritanian government
audit oversight over the audits o f donor-financed projects, which are a significant part o f public
expenditures. Going forward, donors should provide the appropriate Mauritanian government audit
agency with copies o f their project audit reports for review, so that the government i s able to quickly take
appropriate remedial actions against financial mismanagement. To mitigate these risks, there i s also an
immediate need to strengthen the capacity o f the three existing principal audit bodies in Mauritania - the
IGE (General State Inspection), IGF (General Finance Inspection), and the chamber o f account.
Furthermore, the government should give consideration to establishing an independent national audit
agency with a broad mandate. As mentioned above, PRECASP will strongly address these weaknesses.

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA CAS COMPLETION REPORT
2002-2005
Date o f last CAS: M a y 6,2002
Progress report: None
OED CAS Evaluation: August 10,2005
Period Covered by CAS: July 1 2002 -June 30 2005 (FY03-FY05)
Period Covered by the present report: July 1 2002 - December 3 1,2005
Completion Report prepared by: Alexandra Pugachevsky

INTRODUCTION/SUMMARY OF THE REPORT
What CASCR addresses
1.
The Islamic Republic o f Mauritania Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report (CASCR) i s
an internal self-evaluation, which addresses the effectiveness ,of the 2002 Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) for World Bank operations. The conclusions o f this report will provide the lessons learnt which
will be incorporated into the new CAS, due to be delivered in FY07.

CASCR conclusions
2.
Conclusions o f this report were drawn during a series o f participatory meetings with individual
task teams, Project Implementation Units, sector Ministries and during a workshop held with the Country
Team and donor stakeholders in December 2005. Some o f the CASCR analyses were supported by the
OED Country Assistance Evaluation report. The report’s conclusions have been discussed with members
o f the Mauritania country team in preparation for the new CAS period, and with various stakeholders in
the Islamic Republic o f Mauritania.

Results framework linkages
3.
The 2002 CAS was a well-prepared strategy but, as all other country assistance strategies at that
time, it did not focus on results management and monitoring and evaluation o f outcomes. Since the 2002
CAS did not provide clear indicators, it was difficult to define measurable and quantifiable outputs for
some intervention analyses in retrospect. Furthermore, particular interventions impacted more than one
CAS outcome. The 2002 CAS intended outcomes were used as an organizing framework for the CASCR
structure. The outcomes listed in the 2002 CAS are listed under each o f the four strategic pillars, and
relevant interventions are discussed in that context.
4.
Since the CAS did not present a clear set o f measurable indicators, and most o f the listed
outcomes were set at the country-level and were impacted by other factors, in addition to the World
Bank’s program, the CASCR emphasizes what was done by the Bank’s program in terms o f each
individual outcome as a matter o f “contribution”. The document attempts to evaluate the Bank’s o w n
performance and h o w well it achieved i t s intended program. The three indicators used to assess the

- 64 -

Annex C2 - CAS Completion Report

World Bank’s performance are “Substantial contribution”, “Moderate contribution”, and “Insubstantial
contribution”.

Lessons Learnt for the New CAS
5.
The fact that the originally proposed CAS program was so different from the delivered one raises
the issue that the CAS should have had a more explicit low-case scenario o f a program without PRSC
lending. The major shortcoming o f the 2002 CAS was that it was too ambitious and overly focused on
the PRSC delivery, while placing too much trust into the Government’s commitment. The new CAS
should take these issues into account in order to become a document, which remains relevant throughout
the implementation period and i s regularly applied
6.
F r o m the experience o f transforming the non-results-based CAS into a results framework to
conduct the Completion Report, the CASCR brings forth the importance o f drafting well thought-out
indicators to measure and monitor outcomes o f planned operations. The indicators used to measure C A S
delivery and performance should take into account the scope o f W o r l d Bank influence through i t s
interventions, rather than focusing on overly ambitious goals outside o f the World Bank’s area o f impact.
A clear understanding o f country-level vs. project-level objectives i s another important issue to consider
for the new, results-based CAS.

MAURITANIAN CONTEXT AND LONG-TERM DEVELOPMENT AGENDA
PRSP linkages
7.
Poverty Reduction Support Program (PRSP). Mauritania was one o f the first countries to
present a full PRSP (Board in February 2001), with the policy content focusing on 2001-2004, while the
indicator targets covered the period up to 2015. Following the 2001 PRSP presentation, Mauritania was
implementing the strategy in a satisfactory manner. At the time o f the preparation o f the 2002 CAS, it
was expected that Mauritania would proceed with PRSP implementation as planned, and the CAS was
structured to support the country’s efforts accordingly.

8.
The main objective o f the 2002 CAS was to support the Government o f the Islamic Republic o f
Mauritania (GIRM) in the implementation o f the PRSP, focusing on i t s four strategic PRSP axes (i)
accelerating private sector-led growth; (ii)
anchoring growth in the economic development o f the poor;
(iii)
developing human resources and ensuring universal access to basic infrastructure and services; and
(iv) institutional development and governance. In addition to supporting PRSP implementation, the CAS
aimed to build local capacity and to focus on programmatic support through the three planned Poverty
Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs), one for each year o f the CAS.
9.
In 2002, Mauritania was on track to partially reach the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)
on time, namely poverty incidence, education and HIV/AIDS, and was counting on substantial W o r l d
Bank and other donor assistance to meet i t s targets. Thereafter, the country went o f f track with PRSP
implementation, and the CAS was deprived o f i t s strategic base. Currently, a new PRSP i s under
preparation and i s expected to be finalized by early 2006 to cover 2006-2010. The PRSP Progress Report

-65

-

Annex C2 - CAS Completion Report

assessments confirmed that the country s t i l l faces significant challenges and pointed to key constraints to
growth and poverty reduction.

10.
Since 2001, two PRSP Progress Reports (PRs) have been prepared in a participatory manner and
endorsed by the Boards o f the Bretton Woods institutions in June 2002 and July 2003 respectively. A
third PRSP-PR - finalized in 2004, but never officially approved due to persisting uncertainty on key
macroeconomic indicators in 2003 and 2004 (and consequently on medium-term projections) - provided
an action plan to cover 2006. The staff o f the World Bank and the IMF consider Mauritania’s
implementation o f i t s PRSP to date broadly satisfactory, in spite o f recent slippages o n macroeconomic
performance. A full assessment o f the strategy - to be conducted in the second PRSP - i s s t i l l pending.

Significant political shifts/challenges/context
11.
The 2002 CAS was a well-outlined program for the GIRM at the time o f i t s Board discussion,
taking into account the Government’s “wide-reaching macroeconomic, structural and social reform
program that has been both ambitious and successful.’’ However, during the CAS implementation period,
from 2002 to 2005, the country’s political landscape changed substantially. The perceived stability o f the
pre-CAS period did not continue and was followed by a period o f political turmoil, which negatively
affected the CAS implementation and the overall World Bank assistance program. With the benefit o f
hindsight, it i s now considered that the overall decline in Mauritania’s post-CAS performance could be
linked to the fact that i t had achieved HIPC Completion Point at the time o f CAS presentation and that i t s
commitment to reform waned immediately thereafter.
Political Background (before the 2005 coup):

12.
Presidential elections were held as scheduled in November 2003, despite an attempted coup in
June 2003. President Taya, who took power during a coup in December 1984, was re-elected for a third
term. The main opposition candidate - former President Haidallah - was arrested just before the
elections, released a day later and then re-arrested. H e was subsequently condemned and deprived o f his
political rights, but released o n parole.
13.
Early in August 2004, the Government announced that Mauritania had foiled a plot to overthrow
the country’s President. Between 20 and 30 members o f the army are reported to have been arrested for
the alleged coup attempt. Ministerial re-shuffles and changes were very frequent, with the Minister o f
Economic Affairs and Development (MAED) changing four times during the 2001-2005 period. The
most recent Minister o f MAED was appointed in August 2005 just after the most recent (and the only
successful) coup.

14.
Externally, Mauritania, despite being an Islamic republic, continued to maintain strong relations
with the West, sometimes in the face o f strong opposition from other Islamic countries. I t i s one o f only
three Arab countries to recognize Israel and has actively courted U S political and business interests. T h i s
i s expected to continue and even deepen with the exploitation o f the country’s o i l resources.
Political Situation (after the 2005 coup)

After several overthrow attempts, the Mauritanian President Taya was ousted in a bloodless
15.
palace coup on August 3, 2005. The coup leaders established a Military Council for Justice and

- 66 -

Annex C2 - CAS Completion Report

Democracy headed by Colonel Ely Ould Mohamed V a l l (former Chief o f Security), dissolved Parliament,
formed a new Government, and announced that they would step down within two years after national
approval o f a new constitution and parliamentary and presidential elections.
16.
The overthrow o f President Taya received popular support. Colonel V a l l prepared a rapid reform
agenda for the country, aiming to hold parliamentary elections in November 2006 and presidential
elections in March 2007. A s a result o f the coup, donor relations were somewhat strained, but diplomatic
relations maintained.
In response to the coup, the World Bank applied O.P. 7.30 with regard to the “de facto”
17.
Government. The program remained in place, and the Bank continued disbursements under existing
operations, preparation o f new operations went as planned, with a particular focus o n governance and
financial management, but n o new operations would be approved until the suspension has been lifted.

Economic situation during the CAS implementation period
Economic background
Economic Indicators (2004)

18. Since 1992, Mauritania has transformed itself
from a country with a predominantly nomadic
population to a highly urbanized and market-driven
one with relatively strong economic growth (at 4.3%
GDP over the period 1998-2003). Growth to date
has been mainly driven by the expansion o f the
secondary and tertiary sectors o f the economy
(construction and public works, transport and
communication, and trade), rather than the primary
sectors, which suffered from a global economy
slowdown and weaker international prices. The
economy i s s t i l l handicapped by high transportation
costs and an inadequate rural roads network.

19.
The primary sector (agriculture, livestock, artisanal fisheries) i s the main source o f income for the
population and employs an estimated 40 percent o f the labor force. But i t s contribution to GDP i s modest
(19.7 percent in 2003) and has been declining in the last decade. The secondary sector contributes for
about a quarter o f GDP (2003) and i t s relative size has been constant in recent years. By contrast, the
share in GDP o f the tertiary sector has steadily increased over time, reaching 54 percent in 2003. T h i s
phenomenon has been fuelled by the expansion in trade, transport, and communication services, and the
privatization o f the telecommunication sector.
20.
Mauritania’s export base i s heavily concentrated, with nearly all exports consisting o f two
commodities: fish and iron ore, which are highly vulnerable to sharp swings in international prices and
external demand. Attempts at diversifying the economy (agriculture, livestock) have had limited success
to date. The arrival o f oil, which was discovered off-shore in Chinguetti (2001), Banda (2002), T i o f and
Pelican (2003), and Tevet (2004), i s going to change the country’s economic landscape. It i s estimated
that the o i l exports and government revenues will almost triple the per capita income o f the country over
the medium-term, triggering Mauritania’s graduation from IDA status in the near future

Economic developments

2 1.
As with the political landscape, the economic situation in Mauritania became more volatile during
the period o f the 2002 CAS implementation. Since 2003, Mauritania’s seemingly strong macro-economic
performance has deteriorated and the country has departed from long-standing prudent policies.
Progressively during the 2002 CAS implementation period, the World Bank came to realization that i t s
assumptions made o n the development o f the economy and especially the management o f public funds
were inaccurate. Due in part to this incorrect analysis and in part to the inaccurate/false information
provided by the Mauritanian authorities for several years, the CAS was in misalignment with the true
development challenges o f the country.
22.
The moderate increase in public spending since 2000 turned into an off-budget spending spree
between January 2003 and September 2004. This resulted in a cumulative fiscal deficit o f nearly 50
percent o f annual GDP over this period, financed predominantly by central bank credit. In mid-2004,
Mauritania found itself in the need o f a radical stabilization to avert the prospect o f a balance o f payments
crisis and tame a double-digit inflation. Coordinated measures were taken since to reverse the unraveling
o f macroeconomic stability by curbing extra-budgetary expenditure and withdrawing central bank
financing. However, recent evidence points to renewed laxity in the execution o f the 2005 budget.
Relationship with the IMF

23.
Unresolved data issues have adversely affected Mauritania’s relations with the Fund since early
2004. Due to the large fiscal and monetary slippages that went unreported by the authorities until
September 2004, the 2003 PRGF arrangement was cancelled and the authorities voluntarily repaid a noncomplying disbursement in November 2004. At the conclusion o f the 2005 Article IV consultation on
M a y 27, 2005, the IMF Board urged the authorities to cooperate fully with staff to resolve swiftly the
remaining data issues. Directors stressed the need for independent verification o f end-2003 central bank
financial statements and full disclosure o f the information available t o confirm the official reserves o f
200 1-02 before discussions on a staff-monitored program could be initiated. Similarly, the Bank stopped
the preparation o f the first PRSC, planned for FY05.
24.
The CPIA score for 2004 was also negatively affected. While Mauritania used to be firmly in the
first quintile o f IDA countries, the CPIA declined substantially from 3.8 in 2003 to 3.3 in 2004 and
negatively affected the country’s IDA allocation.
25.
Mauritania has IMF Article VI11 status and trade monopolies and export taxes are absent. The
Fund’s trade restrictiveness index for Mauritania i s estimated at 2 (on a scale o f 1 to 10, with 10 the most
restrictive). Trade policy was liberalized significantly in recent years. The number o f tariff bands was
reduced to four, with the maximum tariff set at 20 percent. The average tariff rate was estimated at about
the access to export markets
13 percent in 2002. Important issues that remain to be addressed include: (i)
for Mauritania’s products;, (ii)
the benefits and costs o f closer association with Mauritania’s main regional
partners, including the neighboring West Afiica Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) zone and
Arab Maghreb Union (UMA); and (iii)
the extent o f non-tariff barriers for certain products (e.g., rice).
Priorities also include custom reform (organization, resources, training, incentives, ethics code, and
computerization).

Oil Revenue Management
26.
The imminent arrival o f o i l will place an additional burden o n prudent management o f public
funds. The new Government appears to be fully committed to best practice management o f o i l revenues,
and expressed i t s interest in joining EITI, the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. The
transformation began under the old regime, which, in i t s last months, seemed more willing to discuss o i l
issues with the Bretton Woods institutions but few concrete steps were taken. In September 2005, the
new Government has announced that it will sign up for the EITI, and started undertaking the necessary
steps to j o i n the program - i.e., nomination o f a Government EITI focal point, contacts with the private
sector and mobilization o f civil society.

PROGRESS AND CAS RESULTS

Key objectives o f the CAS
27.
The objectives o f the 2002 CAS were to “support the GIRM in the implementation o f i t s PRSP,”
in particular to follow the four-pillar strategic design, to devote particular attention to capacity building,
and to have programmatic focus through three PRSCs (one for each year covered by the CAS). The main
ambition o f the CAS was the planned shift to programmatic lending, which was going to be underpinned
by the Bank’s core diagnostic ESW. However, the 2002 CAS never achieved i t s main objectives - the
shift to programmatic lending did not occur and the lending program, which was based around the
preparation o f three PRSCs (FY03-04-05), was never h l l y realized.
28.
In the following review, outcomes o f each pillar are analyzed in terms o f the pillar’s main
objective, the Bank’s lending and E S W program, and i t s accomplishments, as related to the 2002 CAS
outcomes converted into results-based measurable outputs and outcomes. Some o f the pillar activities are
interlinked, and results influence each other. Most o f the pillar outcomes are affected by more than one
instrument, whether lending or ESW. Table 2 o f this report summarizes all o f the activities undertaken
during the CAS implementation period. In transforming the objectives stated in the C A S into a resultsbased framework, the CASCR aims to discuss only those objectives that can be directly attributed to
World Bank activities in Mauritania, rather than focusing o n broader, country-level objectives.

Pillar IOutcomes: Accelerating Private Sector-Led growth
Situation before the CASkey challenges

29.
Mauritania’s heavy private sector focus on fishing and iron ore makes diversification o f the
economy a real challenge, especially with the imminent amval o f oil. These commodities are highly
vulnerable to sharp swings in international prices and external demand. Successful o i l exploration and
appraisal drilling programs carried out in the past few years, however, have established offshore
Mauritania as a new, and potentially very significant, hydrocarbon province. I t i s estimated that the o i l
exports and government revenues will almost triple the per capita income o f the country over the
medium-term, expected to trigger Mauritania’s graduation fkom IDA status in the near future.

Annex C2 - CAS Completion Report

Planned interventions by the World Bank

30.
This pillar i s aligned with the first PRSP objective to accelerate private sector-led growth. During
the CAS preparation, private sector-led growth was seen as critical to poverty reduction, income
generation and employment opportunities. Because o f the country’s proximity to European markets, l o w
labor costs and dynamic private sector, export-driven growth was seen as particularly promising.
31.
The World Bank was going to focus i t s Pillar Iinterventions o n a number o f lending and E S W
instruments focused on agriculture, fisheries, financial sector, micro-finance, oil, and mining.
Privatization o f SOMELEC, the country’s electricity monopoly, and also IFC expansion were to be used
as additional instruments to foster private sector development in Mauritania.
A number o f activities planned under this pillar were dropped or postponed to a later date. Other
32.
activities were completed with some variations, as Table B.l below outlines.

Pillar I.Outcome Analysis
Outcome 1.1 Removing remaining barriers to competition and factor mobility - Moderate
contribution

33.
Interventions to achieve this outcome were mainly linked to the activities in the transportation
and electricity sectors. In addition, because o f the country’s heavy reliance o n natural resources for i t s
private sector activities, policies in the mining, o i l and fisheries sectors were considered to influence this
outcome.
34.
The Transport Sector Project (TSP) i s under preparation as o f FY06, with the planned Board date
in mid-FY07. The project team, however, i s closely engaged with other donors, mostly the EU and AFD
o n transport sector coordination issues.
35.
The planned privatization o f SOMELEC under the Partial Risk Guarantee did not materialize, as
the energy sector faced many obstacles, including the Enron scandal and a general market downturn. In
addition, hindsight analysis shows that the privatization was agreed upon as a condition o f achieving the
HIPC Completion Point, and never had Government’s buy-in. The Bank provided, however, some
assistance to the electricity sector through the Energy/Water/Sanitation Sector Reform TA (PARSEAE).
However, this credit has been largely ineffective, with only some enabling decrees in the electricity sector
having been passed. Electricity sector reform and private sector participation in the electricity sector - the
main objective o f the PARSEAE - were not achieved. Therefore, overall implementation o f this credit has
been unsatisfactory.

With respect to natural resources management, the Bank’s assistance was more fruitful than in
36.
transport and electricity sectors. The Mining Cadastre established with the assistance o f the Mining
Sector Capacity Building Project (PRISM) at the Ministry o f Mines and Industry helped to bring
transparent, investor-friendly procedures to the mining sector, which, in turn, brought an impressive
increase in new mining sector activities by the time o f project closure in December 2004. An additional
achievement was that the GIRM became more receptive to technical assistance and transparent
procedures in the o i l sector at the end o f the CAS period, expressing i t s interest in joining the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative, EITI. Finally, the fisheries sector, after the postponement o f the
Fisheries Resources Management AAA, i s going to receive multi-donor assistance under a planned multidonor operation.

-

Outcome 1.2 Improving legal and regulatory environment Moderate contribution

37.
AAA and lending activities, impacting legal and regulatory aspects o f private sector development
were considered to support achievement o f this outcome. Issues relating to natural resources
management, because o f Mauritania’s economic base, were considered to be especially important. In
achieving this outcome, the Bank delivered a strong AAA program, which focused o n capacity building
and improvements in the regulatory environment.

In 2003, the government prepared a global Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) for
38.
2004-2006, which was used for the elaboration o f the 2004 Budget Law. T o date, eight sectoral MTEFs
have been developed (rural and urban development, education, health, water and sanitation, transport

- 72 -

Annex C2 - C A S Completion Report

infrastructure, fisheries, energy) in an effort to streamline the PRSP. The actualization o f global MTEF
and some sectoral MTEF (2005-2007) i s underway.
39.
Discovery o f off-shore o i l in Mauritania brought forward the need for technical assistance in
petroleum management. The CAS outlined “policy advice” intervention, planned to assist the GIRM to
better manage the legal and regulatory framework for the sustainable development o f the o i l sector, did
not go forward as planned. Government resistance to external assistance in petroleum management issues
blocked preparation o f this intervention. After the 2005 coup, however, the new Government has voiced
i t s request for technical assistance in the o i l sector, and the Bank plans to meet GIRM request.
40.
In the mining sector, a sustainable legal and regulatory framework was formed under PMSM with
the approval o f Mining L a w and Regulations and institutionalization o f the Mining Cadastre and sector
agencies. The Bank i s also moving forward with providing GIRM assistance with EITI in both,
petroleum and mining sectors to improve sector governance. The planned Public Sector Capacity
Building Project scheduled to go to the Board in FY06 will also address governance and resource
management issues, which were not covered during the CAS period.
41.
Furthermore, two ongoing IDF grants, Legal Reform and Private Sector Capacity Building and
Support to the Accountancy Profession, address institutional and policy-making capacity o f the Ministry
o f Justice and Ministry o f Economic Affairs and Development and strengthen key agencies in charge o f
private sector development.
Outcome 1.3 Further streamlining tax regulations - Moderate contribution

42.
CAS activities focusing o n capacity building and reform in the tax regulations sector were
evaluated for this outcome. The CAS planned to deliver results in this sector with the Financial Sector
Reform Operation, planned for FY03. This project was not delivered, and the Bank’s assistance in this
domain was limited to AAA activities, mostly because o f disruptions in dialogue with the local
stakeholders and the fact that the PRSP did not go forward as planned.
43.
However, this outcome was supported mostly by the IDF Support to the Accountancy Profession,
which i s implemented with the Ministry o f Economic Affairs and Development to improve capacity in
financial management and taxation, which provided important policy advice on financial management
i ssues.
Outcome 1.4 Exploiting new market opportunities - Moderate contribution
As previously mentioned, the Mauritanian export base i s concentrated o n iron ore and fisheries, and nontraditional exports are a small part o f total exports, (5% according to the OED report). The 2002 CAS
sought to diversify private sector activities in Mauritania by supporting the development o f new activities
in Mauritania’s private sector.

44.
The Bank’s assistance in development o f various private sector activities, especially in the
agricultural sector, can be considered successful. T w o Adaptable Program Loans (APLs) were in
implementation o f their first phases throughout the CAS period: the Integrated Development Project for
Irrigated Agriculture (PDIAIM) and the Rainfed Natural Resource Management Project (PGRNP). Both
interventions went to their second phases, PDRC, the Community-Based Rural Development Project and
PDIMM-2.

- 73 -

Annex C 2 - CAS Completion Report

PDIMM-2 went ahead as planned. The Project provides support to diversification o f the
45.
agricultural export base, commercialization o f agricultural products, improved quality o f rice and other
agricultural products ( h i t s , vegetables, o i l seeds). Agricultural exports reached 800 tonnes in 2004. The
rural portfolio has been considered to be very successful for the Mauritania program as a whole, and the
second phases for the two programs were delivered early, with satisfactory results.
In the fisheries sector, the Bank’s assistance was less successful. The Fisheries Resources
46.
Management System - a planned policy dialogue with GIRM and donors based o n recommendations o f
the “Fisheries Resource Management” study - did not go ahead as planned during the C A S
implementation phase because o f waning interest f i o m the Mauritanian counterparts. In FY06, at the
request o f the new Government, the Bank has restarted the dialogue on the fisheries sector, and i s leading
the effort with other donor agencies.

47.
A Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), covering a number o f private sector activities in
Mauritania was produced in FY03 and influenced policy dialogue on private sector development
activities. The conclusions o f the FY03 CEM, however, were not fully internalized by the GIRM.
Another CEM, focusing on the o i l and mining sector issues i s under preparation for delivery in FY06.
48.
IFC operations did not expand during the CAS implementation period. The IFC representative
based in Senegal has limited direct contact with potential investors, while MIGA limited i t s new activities
to dialogue with the o i l sector operators.
Outcome 1.5 Facilitating savings mobilization and access to services and credit and developing
financial intermediation. Moderate contribution

49.
The financial system o f Mauritania i s not in a position to promote high growth, due largely to i t s
lack o f depth and the heavy concentration o f banking sector activities (notably credit). The oligopolistic
nature o f the banking system and high concentration ratios pose an impediment to the development o f
new economic activities. The government has agreed to reduce the concentration ratios in commercial
banks, both to reduce r i s k exposure and make credit more widely available to the private sector. But this
task has appeared more difficult to implement than expected, owing to the limited number o f creditworthy
borrowers and commercial banks’ preference to mainly finance trade operations with well-known clients.
Banking supervision i s also weak. Domestic financial transactions remain largely cash-based. Cultural
factors play a significant role in the relatively l o w use o f banks for conventional banking functions.
Businesses and individuals rely a great deal o n cash and the informal financial system known as
“tontines,” and the availability o f long-term credit remains scarce. Bank credit i s very expensive, except
for the very best creditors; it i s heavily concentrated on parties affiliated with the banks; and i s largely
made up o f short-term credit. Intermediation margins appear very high, reflecting the oligopolistic
structure o f the banking sector, which encourages neither competition nor efficiency in banking services.
50.
The 2002 CAS planned to address these issues through the Financial Sector Reform Operation
(FY03), which never went forward because o f a change in Government’s priorities. Instead, an E S W was
delivered, which provided policy advice and outlined necessary reform steps for the country’s financial
sector. A Financial Sector Study has been launched in June 2004 and a draft report has been produced in
August 2004.
51.
Despite the fact that the World Bank did not deliver a major operation for financial sector
management, other projects had components which impacted access to financial services. PDIMM

- 74 -

Annex C2 - CAS Completion Report

includes a line o f credit component, which aims to provide a finance mechanism for agribusiness
activities to rural entrepreneurs. This component i s judged to have been successful, having delivered a
line o f credit with 92% repayment rate to agricultural producers.

Outcome 1.6 Lowering production costs - Insubstantial contribution
52.
In terms o f lowering production costs, the Bank was going to focus i t s attention on water,
electricity and transport sector reform to achieve this outcome. The Partial Risk Guarantee for up to
US$10 million to assist the GIRM in the privatization o f SOMELEC, the national electricity company,
was never realized during the C A S period for the reasons mentioned in Outcome 1.1. PARSEAE
implementation, which sought to end monopolistic management o f the water and electricity sectors, to
improve water resources management and to introduce clear tariff procedures was unsuccessful in these
domains. In the transport sector, the Bank’s program has been on hold because o f difficulties in reaching
agreement with the GIRM, and i s taken up in FY06 with the Transport Sector Project planned for FY07.

Outcome 1.7 Increasing private sector participation in the delivery of public services Insubstantial contribution

As mentioned above, the Bank’s assistance in the electricity and transport sectors was weak. In
53.
the mining sector, a Poverty Social Impact Assessment has been launched in FY05 and i s expected to
deliver results in FY07 by evaluating the impact o f reducing the services provided by the national iron ore
mining company (SNIM) to different groups o f the people in the Zouerate-Noudhibou corridor. This
AAA i s intended to impact policy making results and eventually bring private sector participation in
electricity and water services.
Outcome 1.8 Increasing internayexternal competitiveness- Moderate contribution

54.
The Bank’s assistance to achieving this outcome i s evaluated in terms o f improving the country’s
ability to compete on internal and external markets. In the agriculture sector, the country’s
competitiveness was substantially improved by achieving increased exports. PDIAIM and PDIAIM 2
contributed to Mauritania’s agricultural competitiveness by improving the quality and quantity o f the
country’s agricultural exports. Economic growth during the CAS period was driven by the non-traded
goods sector. Telecommunication, transport and commerce were the main drivers for growth (according
to the OED report). The PRISM helped the country’s competitiveness in the mining sector by putting
Mauritania on the global mining investment map after years o f state-owned domination o f the sector by
S N I M . By the end o f PRISM in 2004, gold and copper mining investors were preparing for mine
exploitation. The Bank’s planned assistance in the fisheries sector was not realized until the dialogue
with the Government resumed in FY06.

Pillar I1 Outcome Growth Anchored in the Economic Environment o f the Poor
55.
This pillar was linked to the second PRSP objective, to focus o n “growth anchored in the
economic environment o f the poor.” The negative externalities o f rapid urbanization, such as the
emergence o f slums around the major cities, and the isolation o f most rural areas, were going to be
addressed through the implementation o f this pillar’s instruments. Improvement o f access to basic
services, especially roads, water, sanitation, electricity and waste disposal services were the main focus o f
this pillar assistance.

-75-

Annex C2 - CAS Completion Report

56.
Implementation during the CAS period o f the Urban Development Program (PDU) APL,
approved in 2002, aimed at (i)
supporting Mauritania’s central and local governments to improve living
conditions and promote employment opportunities in the main towns and, in particular, in slums; (ii)
supporting decentralization; and (iii)
strengthening the institutional framework and capacity for urban and
land management at the central and municipal levels” and was the key lending instrument toward
achieving the Pillar I1 objectives. A number o f AAA instruments also supported reaching Pillar I1
objectives. Table B.2 shows the objectives/expected outcomes o f the CAS under Pillar 11, the World
Bank interventions planned to meet those objectives, and the actual deliveries undertaken in support of
them.

Pillar 11. Outcome Analysis
Outcome 2.1 Improved access to basic services/infrastructure - roads, water, sanitation, electricity,
and waste disposal - Moderate contribution

57.
Achievement o f this outcome was disparate. In the electricity sector, as discussed above,
SOMELEC privatization was never completed. The Urban Development Program (PDU), however,
provided assistance to the electricity sector in the El M i n a squatter district o f Nouakchott under one o f i t s
components. Also under PDU, substantial resources were spent o n training o f cadres o f water and electric
utilities. The Energy/Water/Sanitation Sector Reform TA was largely unsuccessful in reaching i t s
objectives because o f problems with the initial design and in-country implementation capacity, but
delivered capacity building to water and electricity sector cadres.
58.
Analyses based on a set o f studies conducted in 2003 and 2004 (i.e., gender-disaggregated database, women’s access to land and property rights, diagnostic o f Mauritanian women, the new Gender
in urban areas, the access o f women to land property has
Strategy, finalized in August 2004) show that: (i)
markedly improved; (ii)
in rural areas, there are s t i l l socio-cultural constraints to the unconditional access
to land and property rights for women. Inresponse, the PDIAIM has integrated into its activities actions to
promote land acquisition by women in rural areas.
59.
In the water sector, as with electricity, the quality o f W o r l d Bank assistance has been uneven.
Also, the multi-donor Aftouf-Es-Saheli Water Supply credit was not delivered during the CAS
implementation period because o f difficulties in reaching agreement o n the project scope and individual
donor contributions. Access to an improved water source at the national level increased from 50 to 54
percent during 2000-2004. The PDU water component included assistance t o the disadvantaged
Nouakchott district o f El Mina. After some implementation delays, some progress in this component has
been achieved, and the Program continues to improve water supply in other Nouakchott districts.

60.
One o f the issues negatively affecting achievement o f this outcome has been Mauritania’s lack o f
capacity in civil works. Projects with large civil works components, such as PDU (Urban Development
Program) or the Higher Education Project have been plagued by delays caused by l o w capacity in the
building sector, renegotiations o f contracts due to price fluctuations and poor quality o f deliverables.
Furthermore P D U faced supervision problems with donor coordination.

-

Outcome 2.2 Development of the rural and infrastructure sectors Moderate contribution

61.
This outcome was influenced by AAA activities.
Sectoral Medium Term Expenditure Frameworks
(MTEFs) were delivered. As mentioned above, the
Aftouf-Es-Saheli Water Supply project was not delivered,
and assistance in the transport sector during the 2002
CAS period was weak. PDIAIM, however, improved
irrigaion for agriculture in the Senegal River basin with
1OOOha rehabilitated in an environmentally sound
manner. PDIAIM2 continues to carry out improvements
in rural irrigation infrastructure.

Outcome 2.3 Improvedliving standards in slums around the major cities and rural areas
Moderate contribution

63.
PDU, as mentioned under Outcome 2.1, assisted with the improvement o f living conditions in
several slum districts in Nouakchott. PDU performance has been variable throughout i t s implementation
period. Toward the end o f the C A S implementation period, PDU was able to overcome its disbursement
lags and improved implementation, contributing to improved living conditions in several Nouakchott
disadvantaged districts. PDU provided 7,365 micro credits (housing and economic activities loans
included) to slum dwellers and estimates that 55,000 (vs. 0 at the start o f the program) slum dwellers are
n o w using basic urban upgraded infrastructure.

Pillar I11 Outcomes Developing Human Resources and Ensuring Universal Access to Basic
Services and Infrastructure

64.
This pillar was structured around the PRSP focus on the poor, especially with their lack o f access
to primary education, primary health care, clean water and sanitation. Progress o f the health and
education sectors towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals were the primary focus o f this
pillar through PRSP implementation. While Mauritania i s relatively well placed to reach some o f the
MDGs, it i s unlikely that the bulk o f the health and education-related goals will be reached unless
resources to these sectors result in improved outcomes amongst the poor and in the most disadvantaged
areas.
65.
In the health sector, the non-delivery o f the PRSCs very much upset the planned IDA support for
the sector, as that sector was originally planned to be enveloped into PRSC lending. When the PRSCs did
not materialize the health sector was left without IDA financing and faced difficulties in preparing a
specific health sector operation.
66.
IDF grants for promoting application o f the l a w and advancement o f the legal status o f women
and for PRSP implementation were extended in FY03. The High Case scenario planned for AAA
activities, including the Market Dynamics in the Health Sector ESW, Labor Market Study (FY04) and a
Strategic Country Gender Assessment (FY03) were not delivered. The Lending program in support o f
this pillar, in addition to PRSC program support, focused on the implementation o f the Education Reform
Sector Program APL, approved in FY02, the Multi-Sectoral H I V / H D S Control Project (MAP) delivered
in FY03, and the Health Sector Investment Project (HSIP) and the Nutrition, Food Security, and Social
Mobilization Project, both o f which were already active at the time o f the 2002 CAS delivery and closed
in FY05.
Significant improvements in social indicators have been realized over the past few years, which
67.
includes the CAS implementation duration: Gross primary school enrollment rates increased from 49% in
1987 to 96% in 2004 and access to maternal health care has increased from 65% in 2000 to about 80% in
2004. The share o f girls in total primary enrollment rose, narrowing the gap with boys. Progress was
also made in the areas o f child vaccination, life expectancy and child mortality. Access to maternal health
care increased from 65% to 80%. Child vaccination rates have increased from 40% in 2000 to 93% in

-79-

Annex C2 - CAS Completion Report

2004. However, there are remaining issues such as a weak Government strategy addressing nutrition
issues, high child and maternal mortality rates and a declining retention rate in primary schools.
68.
Between 1990 and 2000 (the period before 2002 CAS), it i s estimated that the incidence o f
poverty as a whole fell f i o m 56.6 to 46.7 percent, a major achievement. However, inequality has been
rising in both rural and urban areas (measured by the GIN1 index which varied from 0.35 in 2000 to 0.41
in 2002). The new Household Survey, whose data should be published in the very near future, will
provide further information on the evolution o f poverty since 2000. However, the country i s not o n track
in the areas o f infant mortality and maternal mortality rates. Overall, health care suffers from the l o w
quality o f services provided, owing to the inadequacy o f human resources in the sector and poor access to
health facilities, notably in rural areas.
69.
Indicators listed above cover a range o f time periods, and clear and measurable social indicators
for the FY03-FY06 period are not available. Furthermore, the fact that the World Bank’s contribution to
advancement o f these social sectors i s particularly difficult to measure should be kept in mind in
evaluating i t s performance in achieving Pillar 111outcomes during the CAS implementation period.
Table B.3 below shows the outcomes that the World Bank planned to achieve under Pillar 111, the
70.
planned activities to meet those goals, and the actual program delivered.

Outcome Analysis
Outcome 3.1 Decrease in child mortality and maternal mortality, reduce fertility and malnutrition

- Moderate contribution
71.
The World Bank sought to influence achievement o f this outcome through the Nutrition, Food
Security, and Social Mobilization Project LIL. The objectives o f the project were to: (a) improve the
nutritional status o f mothers and children; (b) promote children’s physical development; and (c) increase
income generating activities o f participating parents. While the development objectives were consistent
with the country needs and the Bank priorities, fundamental weaknesses in the project design and
deficiencies in the implementation arrangements and monitoring and evaluation mechanisms ultimately
affected the efficiency with which the project objectives were achieved and delayed completion by almost
three years. The project became effective on October 1 3 ~ 1999
,
and closed o n April 30’, 2005.
The LIL was a complex project, which overestimated local capacity for implementation. The
72.
impact study (2005) found that 23.1% o f children in the six- to 24 month-old group are s t i l l underweight
at the end o f the project compared to 27.5% at baseline,.which comes to an underweight reduction o f
16%. However, the reduction was only found in the urban areas o f Nouadhibou and Nouakchott, while
the three regions in the interior o f the country showed an increase in the number o f underweight children
(from 22% to 30.4% in Hodh-el-Gharbi and from 21% to 27% in Gorgol). Most o f the L I L ’ s components
are rated as either “unsatisfactory” or as “moderately unsatisfactory.”
73.
The Health Sector Investment Project (HSIP), which sought to help lower the fertility rate, reduce
infant and under-five mortality rates, had a varying contribution to achieving these objectives. The
fertility rate declined to approximately 4.1 to 4.6 in 2003 from 6.5 in 1998, more than expected. At the
end o f 2003, under-five mortality declined from 182 per 1,000 to only 123 per 1,000 vs. the projected 90
per 1,000. The infant mortality rate declined from 118 per 1,000 to 74 per 1,000 at the end o f 2002, also
with the contribution from the HSIP. Other factors are likely to have contributed to these changes,
however, and the Bank’s contribution i s difficult to separate from other factors that may have played a
role, such GIRM’s own initiatives and other donor programs. In addition, the HSIP was approved in
FY99, and technically most o f i t s implementation falls outside o f the 2002 CAS period.
Outcome 3.2 Reduce the burden of expenditures on health of the poor - Moderate contribution

74.
The Bank sought to influence this outcome through the Multi-sectoral HIV/AIDS and
Communicable diseases Control Project (MAP) and the HSIP. HIV prevalence i s amongst the lowest in
Sub-Saharan Afiica, at 0.6% o f the population, and the Government’s willingness to proceed with the
project indicates a high level o f commitment and desire to work with the Bank on addressing the issue.
The Bank-sponsored MAP was effective in January 2004 and has faced many problems with
implementation. Even though leadership for this program i s located in the Prime Minister’s office and has
translated to date in strong cross-sectoral response at both the central and decentralized levels, problems
with the MAP concern essentially the slow release o f counterpart hnds and problems with procurement.
MAP reported a troubling trend o f 0.87% HIV prevalence among women aged 15 to 19, vs. 0.52% in
2003.
75.
The HSIP sought to address l o w access and poor quality o f health services and weak sector
management. Hospital occupancy rates, a measure o f success o f the quality o f health services, remained
at 60% and did not reach the expected 80%. Some regional hospitals had only 30% occupancy.

- 82 -

Accessibility o f primary care facilities, another HSIP indicator, increased from 65% o f population living
at less than 5 k m from a health facility to 77% in 2003. As mentioned above, the Bank’s contribution to
this outcome i s difficult to separate and the indicator i s likely to be impacted by factors outside o f the
Bank’s influence, such as the GIRM’s o w n initiatives, or sector reform efforts sponsored by other donors.
Outcome 3.3 Promote participation and involvement of communities and users in the management
and delivery o f health interventions - Moderate contribution

76.
The Nutrition project worked on the community level to deliver health services to local
populations. The Community nutrition program component (20% o f total cost) sought to enhance the
ability o f families to take better care o f young children. It did so by guaranteeing the monthly availability
o f services for the prevention and treatment o f malnutrition, including growth monitoring o f children less
than three years o f age, individual counseling to mothers, nutritional supplements to pregnant and
lactating women, and health education. The implementation progress in urban areas was better than in
rural areas due to lack o f implementing NGOs in the interior o f the country, until, in 2003, the NGOs
were removed as intermediaries and regional nutritionists took over the supervision function. The
component managed to mobilize large numbers o f women with young children, between 20 and 25
percent o f the population in specific locales. The greatest impact o f the community component has been
creating awareness about young children’s special need for nutritious diets in order to preserve health, as
evidenced by the survey done among the beneficiaries.
Outcome 3.4 Universal access to primary education: Moderate Contribution

Interventions in increasing school attendance impacted achievement o f this outcome. In the
77.
education sector, the Bank’s operations and policy advice support the objectives o f the National Program
for the Development ofthe Education Sector (PNDSE 2002-lo), prepared by the authorities, aiming at
achieving universal access to basic education, improving the quality o f teaching and learning in the
classroom and the efficiency o f the system. Access to education increased t o 95% in 2004-2005 from
43% in 1998. As with the health sector, the W o r l d Bank’s role in this dramatic increase i s difficult to
distinguish from other factors.
78.
Mauritania has also begun to benefit from the Education for All Fast Track Initiative to accelerate
the implementation o f the national education program. It received US$7million in 2004, and a further
U S $ 2million was expected in 2005. As stated above, gross primary education rates are currently
measured at 95%, surpassing the 91% target set for project completion.
Outcome 3.5 Increased education completion rates: Insubstantial contribution

79.
While primary school enrollment went up during the CAS implementation period, primary
education completion rates have dropped to 44% from 55% in 2001. Secondary school completion rates
also went down. In addition, vocational training, very much needed to meet the country’s professional
needs, was not delivered, while tertiary education facilities were oversaturated with students, who were
unable to find employment thereafter. Furthermore, new bilingual reform in Mauritania required teacher
certifications in both, French and Arabic. The Bank’s program did not include assistance to this new
requirement and therefore did not respond to Mauritania’s need for teacher training.

- 83 -

Annex C2 - CAS Completion Report

Outcome 3.6 Expanded access to secondary education and improved quality o f education at all
levels - Insubstantial contribution

80.
Quality o f primary education, as measured by success rate in secondary schools has gone down
during the 2002 CAS implementation period. The success rate o f secondary school diplomas was
measured at 45.3% in 2002 and i s currently well below the final target o f 65%. However, the quality of
the 2002 indicators was being questioned, particularly on monitoring and evaluation o f progress towards
achievement o f this outcome. In general, the major reason identified for this poor performance i s the lack
o f qualified primary and secondary school teachers following bilingual reform, where education was
uniformly done in French and Arabic, as mentioned under Outcome 3.5.
8 1.
Government clearly expressed i t s demand for improved quality o f higher education, requesting
improvements to the University o f Nouakchott and financing the Environmental Assessment in
preparation o f this credit. The program responded to the Government’s request and financed the Higher
Education Development Project, which focuses mainly on improvements to the University o f Nouakchott
campus. Problems with the building sector already mentioned above have harmed performance o f this
credit and delayed implementation.

Pillar I V Outcomes Institutional Development and Governance
Situation before CASKey challenges

82.
This pillar supported the final PRSP objective o f improving public sector management and crosssectoral capacity building. The CAS identified the lack o f Ministerial capacity and their overly high
dependence on the PIUs for technical knowledge as an area to be addressed. A number o f the Bank’s
E S W interventions focused o n rural and urban sector MTEFs, annual reviews o f the Public Investment
Program. Good governance received particular attention in the CAS, with the planned Country Financial
Accountability Assessment (FY03), the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC), the
Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) in FY05, and analytical work for monitoring and
evaluation, fiduciary framework, and poverty-reducing public expenditure. An E S W on Economic
Regulation and an IDF o n Completing Procurement Reform were also planned. In addition, an increase in
WBI interventions was planned around training seminars on several aspects o f the PRSP process and
public expenditure management.
83.
The Bank’s lending program for this pillar focused on the Institutional and Capacity Building
Project for Natural Resource Management (FY05) and a supplemental credit for the Mining Sector
Capacity Building Project, which sought to build capacity in mineral resources sector management.
Current situation

84.
Financial supervision remains weak. Information on public expenditure at each stage o f the
process i s not consolidated and, as a result, expenditure control i s difficult and tracking remains only
partial. Governance overall deteriorated over the period examined, with most o f the problems starting
much earlier than 2003-2004. As was mentioned above, a number o f assumptions o n which the CAS was
founded, and especially those used to focus on Pillar N program delivery, were incorrect.

- 84 -

Annex C2 - C A S Completion Report

85.
The analysis undertaken in the 2004 Public Expenditure Review shows that in recent years the
Mauritanian government has considerably re-oriented public spending f i o m unproductive activities
(military spending, transfers) towards the promotion o f human resources development (health and
education). Social and poverty-related spending increased fiom 8 percent o f GDP in 200 1 to 11.4 percent
o f GDP in 2003. However,fiscal reporting remains weak. Complete government accounting records have
not been kept for several years, and the Treasury i s unable t o prepare the monthly Treasury balance
necessary for preparation o f the consolidated fiscal reports (TOFE). Fiscal reporting i s s t i l l not
computerized, although progress has been made in recent time.

Pillar IV. Outcome Analysis

-

Outcome 4.1 Improve public sector management Moderate contribution

86.
The 2002 CAS recognized the GIRM’s weak administrative capacity which hindered the
country’s ability to absorb developmental aid. As a result, the CAS particularly emphasized both P I U
capacity building and capacity improvement o f core government ministries and agencies. Over the period
o f CAS implementation, due to a high amount o f spending outside the budget, the overall fiscal balance
(excluding grants) went from a surplus o f 3.8 percent o f GDP in 2002 to a deficit o f 36.9 percent o f GDP
in 2003 and 23 percent o f GDP in 2004. The current account balance (excluding o i l and mining related
activities) deteriorated sharply from a surplus o f 5 percent o f GDP in 2002 t o a deficit o f 16 percent o f
GDP in 2003 and 15.4 percent o f GDP in 2004. Preliminary indication points to renewed laxity in the
execution o f the 2005 budget, which required the approval o f a Budget Rectification L a w in October
2005. These data are likely to change, as the authorities have recently provided fresh evidence pointing to
the existence o f extra-budgetary spending prior to 2003.

87.
In FY06, the Bank i s preparing, with other partners, a capacity building operation (PRECASP)
which focuses on public expenditure management, modernization o f the public administration,
decentralization and environment. I t i s expected that this operation will address weak public sector
management capacity in Mauritania. During the CAS implementation period, a number o f operations
delivered training components (such as PRISM, PDU, among others), which focused on capacity building
o f public sector officials.

-

Outcome 4.2 Cross-sectoral capacity building in GIRM ministries Moderate contribution

88.
The 2002 CAS correctly identified that sector ministries lack capacity to implement their
respective responsibilities. Some o f the operations aimed to address this issue. The Mining Sector
Capacity Building Project supplemental credit turned into a full U S $ l 8 million operation, the Second
Mining Sector Capacity Building Project (PRISM2), which became effective during the implementation
period o f PRISM, thus providing for continuity and increased support to mining sector management.
PRISM2 worked closely with the Ministry o f Mines and Industry to improve i t s institutional capacity,
ability to manage sector agencies, such as the Mining Cadastre, and focused o n sustainability o f sector
institutions.
89.
T o follow up on policy prescriptions, the authorities and the W o r l d Bank are also preparing a
Public Sector Capacity Building Project (PRECASP) with a strong environment component. This
component supports the mainstreaming o f environmental issues in Mauritania, as recommended in the
Sub-Saharan Africa Regional Environment Strategy endorsed by the Board in 200 1.
90.
Mauritania i s a good example o f a n o n WBI focus country that takes excellent advantage o f
distance learning to tap into WBI learning programs. The number o f Mauritanian participants in WBI
programs has averaged 340 a year in the last four years. T h i s relatively strong participation was
facilitated by the frequent use o f the Bank’s videoconferencing facilities prior to the establishment of the
GDLN center in Nouakchott and n o w continues at an even higher level. Since Mauritania joined the
GDLN in 2003, close to 60% o f participants are being reached though distance learning, compared to
30% two years ago. The GDLN, Global Distance Learning Center Project, was prepared in direct
response to Government demands for public sector capacity building. The US$3.5 million GDLN credit
became effective in September 2003, as a capacity building training tool to establish physical

- 87 -

infrastructure for a Global Distance Learning Center with linkages to other centers and
partnershipdnetworks with other donors. Mauritania also takes great advantage o f the regional face-toface activities conducted by WBI in neighboring Senegal. In FY05, the most popular programs were
and Health and Population
Public-private Partnerships in Infrastructure (86 participants), Education (8 l),
(45).

BANK PERFORMANCE DURING THE CAS PERIOD
Volume, lending instruments and scenarios
91.
T o date the World Bank has approved 57 projects in Mauritania for a total o f US$1,059 million.
The current portfolio has 9 operations for a total o f US$270.4 million, with an undisbursed balance o f
US$185.4 million as o f December 15, 2005. However as o f January 1, 2006, the portfolio only has 8
operations as the Energy/Water/Sanitation Sector Reform Technical Assistance Project has been closed
on December 31, 2005. The Bank’s program concentrates o n rural development, urban development and
social sector operations, with other specific investments in growth-stimulating sectors, such as mining,
energy, and transport. Over the past few years, the Bank has been actively consolidating i t s portfolio in
Mauritania, decreasing the number o f projects from 13 in FY02 to 9 in F Y 0 6 in order to provide more
focused and streamlined support. High-level scenarios presented in the CAS were not played out due to
political and economic constraints.

92.
There i s a significant variation between what was planned under the 2002 CAS program and the
actual deliverables. There exist several reasons for this discrepancy. First, the IDA envelope was larger
than planned for the first two years o f CAS implementation, as Mauritania’s CPIA ratings soared and
IDA top-offs were given. Second, the country’s derailment o f the PRSC process explains the changes
between IDA interventions as originally planned and actually delivered. Finally, individual project
scenarios, as presented in the pillar analysis sections above, required either postponements, substitutions
or cancellations o f individual credits and program activities.

Portfolio Quality
The summary table o n the right presents a snapshot o f the Mauritania’s portfolio as o f January 1,2006.

- 88 -

Annex C 2 - C A S Completion Report

93.
The portfolio has 8 operations for a total o f
US$260.5 million, with an undisbursed balance o f
US$183.9 million. Portfolio performance has
deteriorated in FY05 and FY06, going from zero
problem projects to 33% problem projects, and 33%
projects at risk. Since 2003 Mauritania i s n o longer
eligible for IDA grants, as i t s GNI per capita (US$420)
surpassed the IDA grants threshold (US$360). This does
not take into account the arrival o f o i l which may
increase the GDP per capita from around US$630 in
2005 to over US$1,500 beyond 2010. While Mauritania
will eventually become an IBRD country, the Bank will
continue i t s investment projects in specific sectors that
target poverty reduction (such as health, education and
water) and that support growth (such as mining, rural
and agricultural development). These focus areas are
fully in line with the PRSP and with the Bank’s proven
strengths in Mauritania.

AAA Program
96.
Substantial efforts went into preparation and delivery o f the AAA program during the CAS
implementation period. As a rule, AAA programs may have three potential development impacts (i)
influence o n the policy agenda; (ii)setting the framework for WB operations, or (iii)
helping
institutional capacity building. The 2002 CAS program in Mauritania was reviewed taking these possible
impacts into account.
97.
Originally, the planned ESW deliverables aimed t o supplement the shift to programmatic lending
and to improve World Bank assistance to the Government-led PRSP efforts. As the PRSC program
derailed, strong AAA program performance continued but focused i t s impacts mostly on capacity
building efforts, with some programs influencing the policy agenda.

98.
The CAS specified that non-lending products “will become increasingly important in assisting the
GIRM to identify new sources o f growth, accelerate growth in sectors with high potential, enhance
overall economic management, develop human capacity, improve mobilization and allocation o f
resources and reduce poverty” because o f the country’s “sustained track record in stabilization and
structural reform.” Despite weak political stability and capacity, the CAS implementation period saw a
number o f successful AAA products. The sectoral MTEFs influenced dialogue in infrastructure sectors.
Also, the Country Economic Memorandum delivered in FY03 fostered cooperation with Mauritanian
government and dialogue on private sector development.

CAS PERFORMANCE SUMMARY EVALUATION
Selectivity
99.
The W o r l d Bank program did not follow the CAS outline because o f the divergence with the
original PRSP plans. Project selection was handled in some cases in a haphazard manner, trying t o
respond to specific and changing Government demands and country conditions. The Bank did try to

- 91 -

Annex C2 - CAS Completion Report

focus i t s operations and increase selectivity, shrinlung the number o f interventions from 13 to 9. There
was a high degree o f flexibility to the portfolio. Some operations were delayed until the end o f the CAS
period, some scale-ups became full-blown operations, and some planned projects were not delivered at
all. For lending operations, the CAS was not used as a prescriptive management tool, but became an
outdated document rather soon after i t s discussion by the Board. In the case o f the E S W program, the
C A S was more closely applied and the planned E S W program was in the majority o f instances closely
followed.

Sustainability o f CAS Outcomes and InstitutionalImpact
100.
Sustainability o f CAS Outcomes i s rated as “Moderately Sustainable,” and Institutional Impact as
“Moderately Satisfactory”. Even though implementation o f the program has been uneven, recent changes
in Government have led to an improvement in the GIRM-donor relations. The Bank expects to continue
cooperating with GIRM on a number o f issues (such as oil, revenue management). Sector ministries work
with the Bank as real partners and MAED actively participates in reviewing the portfolio, and has left the
Bank with the overall positive impression. The World Bank should remain realistic about these first
impressions, however, taking into account the mistakes o f the 2002 CAS.

OED Findings o f Evaluated Projects
101. The OED Country Assistance Evaluation of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania for the period of
1993 to 2002 finds institutional impact o f World Bank operations in Mauritania to be “unsatisfactory.”
Lack o f reliable data negatively impacted World Bank efforts to improve transparency and public
resources management. During the period o f 1992-2003, OED reviewed a total o f 21 closed Bankfinanced projects in Mauritania, amounting to US$383 million in commitments. 71.4% o f the closed
projects had satisfactory outcomes. 25% had “substantial” institutional development impact, and 57.1%
had “likely” sustainability. These ratings show an improvement in comparison to the 1980s and early
199Os, as per the OED report.

Assessment and Mitigation of Risks
102.
At the time o f the 2002 CAS preparation, Mauritania was seen as a “reliable and committed
development partner.” Most o f the risks were considered as negligible and disregarded as such. The
2002 CAS specifies that “there are few risks associated with the Bank’s strategy in Mauritania,” and that
Mauritania “has shown itself to be a very reliable partner” through Country Portfolio Performance
Review (CPPR), macroeconomic and structural performance. As a result, political instability and poor

- 92 -

Annex C2 - C A S Completion Report

macroeconomic performance came as a surprise during the 2002 CAS implementation period. T w o key
weaknesses o f the 2002 C A S document were that it neither considered potential implications o f political
instability nor presented alternative scenarios for the PRSP-strategy focus.
103.
The risk assessment was thus only partially accurate. However, the CAS accurately identified
Mauritania’s vulnerability to exogenous factors, such as: “(i)
fluctuations in world prices for i t s principal
climatic fluctuations, such as rainfall and plagues (desert
exports: iron ore and fisheries products; (ii)
locusts and birds); (iii)
international aid, given Mauritania’s high dependency on aid for investments; and
(iv) Mauritania’s significant debt burden.”
104.
During CAS implementation, risk mitigation, especially for unexpected risks, was well-managed.
The World Bank responded quickly to changing country needs and delivered o n Government’s demands.
Good examples o f this response are the Emergency Locust Project (which was delivered in record time to
respond to the famine) and the Higher Education Credit (which delivered based o n the Government’s
request to boost higher education).

Role of the Bank’s Country Office and Partners
105.
Mauritania relies heavily on outside assistance for the implementation o f i t s PRSP. The Bank i s
one o f the most important donors in the country, both in financial terms and for i t s advice and analyhcal
services. In the past, the strong performance o f Mauritania enabled it to benefit from a very high IDA
allocation (for example, Mauritania received US$122.5 million in IDA lending in FY02). Lending has
dropped in recent years in line with the country’s actual IDA allocations with n o lending in FY03, lending
o f US$84 million in F Y 0 4 and US$54 million in FY05. I t will further drop in the context o f IDA-14 for
which an equivalent o f US$69 million has been allocated for FY06-08, due to the sharp deterioration in
the CPIA rating between 2003 and 2004. After the August 2005 bloodless coup, the World Bank
recommended to temporarily suspend approval o f new operations in Mauritania, but to continue
disbursement under existing operations, and to continue preparation o f new operations. It i s our
assessment that all criteria for full re-engagement have been met by January 2006, and Management has
agreed to re-engage gradually with a priority on capacity building and governance strengthening
106. I F C and MIGA activities in Mauritania are limited. Mauritania does not have an in-country I F C
representative and generating new activities proved difficult with only one new activity approved in 2004.
IFC’s Mauritanian portfolio stood at US$19.8 million, comprising o f 2 projects in the banking and
agribusiness sectors. In 2005, IFC disbursed a US$10 million line o f credit, i t s seventh loan, to the
Gdndrale de Banque de Mauritanie (GBM). This bank has benefited from IFC technical assistance as well
as financial support through the years to become one o f the largest and most active lending institutions
supporting the Mauritanian economy.
107.
MIGA i s in the process o f negotiating a US$50 million guarantee for Woodside’s petroleum
development. There are no other activities in Mauritania.
108.
Some o f the operations implemented under the 2002 CAS have benefited from other donor
financing. For example, PRISM and PRISM2 received supplemental financing from the Islamic
Development Bank and French Cooperation, while others, such as PDIHM engaged in coordination
efforts with other donors (African Development Bank, FAO), focusing on similar activities. These

- 93 -

Annex C2 - C A S Completion Report

sources o f joint or parallel financing were negotiated and implemented o n an individual, project-byproject basis, and were not systematized under a jointly prepared strategy with a particular donor agency.

Borrower performance
109.
Borrower performance was considered partially satisfactory during the CAS implementation
period. While relationship with the Government started o n a very positive note, cooperation deteriorated
after budgetary misreporting was uncovered. While the Government was a willing partner and delivered
what was expected in some sectors, the dialogue was taboo in others (such as petroleum revenue
management until August 2005). The Government also did not completely deliver on the PRSP, thus
derailing the backbone for CAS operations, and jeopardizing the implementation o f the Bank’s planned
program.

KEY CONSIDEFUTIONS FOR THE NEXT CAS
110.
Portfolio and new Operations. The new Government i s sensitive to the need to continue the
reform started in the sphere o f public finance (public expenditure management) and more recently, public
administration (modernization o f the system). The Capacity Building Operation, (PRECASP), currently
under preparation, could become a key project for the Government to support these reforms, and therefore
an important vehicle o f engagement for the Bank and other development partners which contribute to i t s
preparation.

111. Private sector development will be an area o f focus for World Bank programs under the new
CAS, which will aim to minimize Mauritania’s potentially high dependence on o i l and to diversify the
economy which has a demonstrated tendency to rely o n exploitation o f natural resources. Petroleum
sector management, with the assistance o f the EITI and Bank instruments i s another aspect which will be
explored by the next CAS. Private sector development programs will be managed through cooperation
with the JFC, MIGA and other donors.
Collaboration with other donors i s very important to avoid duplication o f effort and the Bank already
started the dialogue to ensure sound performance in areas o f Government’s focus. I t i s expected that the
new CAS will be done through a collaborative process.
The CAS should also present alternatives to the PRSP process and present a well thought-out risk
mitigation strategy, to avoid duplication o f the mistakes o f the 2002 CAS.
Finally, the new CAS should have a well-designed results matrix to ensure monitoring and evaluation o f
actual World Bank interventions.

MAURITANIA
COUNTRY FEVAKCINGPARAMETERS: PROPOSED FRAr’MEWORK
A. Summary

1.
T h i s note provides the background and supporting rationale for the Coumhy
Financing Parameters (CFP) for Mauritania, imder the Bank’s recently approved new policy
framework for expenditure eligibility in investment lending. The new CFP f i m e w o r k was
discussed with the Government o f Mauritania in M a y 2005 and the Govemment expressed its
strong desire to make full use o f the greater flexibility in expenditure eligibility when and
where appropriate. This note has been discussed with the Government and with the country
team and incorporates the comments received to date.
2.
I t was agreed that in Mauritania the Bank would continue to finance a xnaxinium o f
90 percent o f project costs. I t i s possible that deviations from this parameter will be requested
fiom the RVP (see BP 6.00) so that individualprojects may be financed up to 100 percent but
this will only be done on a selective case-by-case basis based on ineritljustification (see
Section G below). I t was also agreed that the Bank may continue to finance recurrent and
local costs in any proportion needed for individual projects, but this financing will be applied
after careful consideration of sector and project sustainability issues (see Sections H and I).
Cw-rently. there are no excessive taxes and duties in Mauritania, and the Bank niay also
finance taxes and duties inproject costs (Section J).
B. Background
3.
Political Background. On August 3, 2005, the Mauritanian President Odd
S i d ’ h e d Taya was ousted in a bloodless palace coup. The coup leaders established a
h..rilitrUy Council for Justice and Democracy (CMJD) headed by Taya’s former chief o f
security (Odd Mohamed Vall), dissolved Parliament, formed a new Government, and
mioumced that they will step down within 19 months after the approval o f a new constitution
and parliamentary and presidential elections. Since the military coup, the new authorities
have made proinking steps towards the three objectives (deniocratization, judicial refornis,
and economic goveinance) that they have set for the transition government. Relations with
the main development partners are normalizing.

4.
Economic BackBound. Mauritania i s a vast albeit sparsely populated coilutsy. More
than 90 percent o f the land surface i s desert, with less than 20Omm rainfall per year. Only the
soethein extrenlity supports rain-fed vegetation. The current population i s around 2.8 million
and GNP per capita i s estimated at just over 600 dollars in2005. The socio-cultural landscape
has recently imdergone a rapid transfonation: fro111 a traditionally nomadic society at
iudependence (1960) over half the population (1.6 million) now lives in urban centers.
5.
Export Bnse. Mauritania’s expoit base is heavily concentrated on fishing and iron ore
and diversification o f the economy i s a real challenge. These commodities are highly
vulnerable to sharp swings in inteinational prices and external demand. Successful oil
exploration and appraisal drilling program c m i e d out in the past few years, however. have
established offshore Mauritania as a new, and potentially very significant, hydrocarbon

province. I t i s estimated that the oil exports and government revenues will h o s t triple the
per capita income o f the country over the medium-ten% triggering Mauritania’s graduation
from IDA status inthe near fuhue.
C. Macroeconomic Situation and Relationship with Bauk and Fund

6.
Background 12001-2004). Mauritania economic growth has been relatively good in
recent years, averaging 4.8 between 200 1 and 2004. But the country dqarted fi-om the longstanding prudent policies that had earned it the reputation o f a strong perfoiiiier. Indications
have emerged in 2004 on the execution o f sigmficant extra-budgetary spending in 2003 and
2004 (and possibly earlier), fmanced predominantly by Central Bank ( B o credit. Some
remedial measures have been initiated since mid-2004 to reverse the unraveling o f
macroeconomic stability by curbing extra-budgetary expenditure and withdrawing B C M
hancing. As a result. the IMF PRGF, approved in July 2003, was canceled on November
2004, while tlie World Bank stopped the prepmation of the first Poverty Reduction Support
Credit (PRSC), planned for FYOS.

7.
Fiscal Stance. Due to the execution o f large c h u k s o f spending outside the budget,
the overall fiscal balance (excluding grants) went from a surplus o f 3.8 percent o f GDP in
2002 to a deficit o f 36.9 percent o f GDP in 2003 and 23 percent o f GDP in 2004. The ciurent
account balance (excluding oil and xiliuing related activities) deteriorated sliarply from a
suqdiis o f 5 percent o f GDP in 2002 to a deficit o f 16 percent o f GDP in 2003 and 15.4
percent o f GDP in 2004. Prelitllinary indication points to renewed laxity in the execution o f
the 2005 budget, which required the approval o f a Budget Rectification Law in October 2005.
These data are likely to change, as the authorities have recently provided fresh evidence,
pointing to the existence o f extra-budgetary spending pi-ior to 2003.
8.
Recent Developments (20052. The new goveinment i s committed to reestablishing
macro-budgetary dmipline and foster transparency. In a welcome development, it signed up
to the Extractive Indushy Transparency Initiative (EITI) in September 2005. The authorities
decided to solve the data issues that plagued Mauritania’s relations with the Fund for two
years, notably concerning: (a) exteinal audit o f the BCM accounts for 2004; (b) independent
verification o f the BCM financial statements as o f end-2003: and (c) full disclosure o f
infomation available to confnm tlie level o f oMicial reserves for 2001-02. Discussions on
the establishment o f a 6-niontli Staff-monitored Program (SMP) are expected for the second
half o f January 2006, and could pave the way to a low-access PRGF (or PSI) in late 2006.
9.
Following the coup, and in compliance with O.P. 7.30 (de facto govmnments), the
World Bank has not suspended disbursements and the Bank i s preparing to fidly engage with
the comtry, given the favorable o f the international commmity and progress on governance
issues. The Bank i s preparing, with other partners. a capacity building operation (PRECASP)
which focuses 011 public expenditure management, modeinkation o f the public
administration. decentralization and eiiviromnent. Updates o f the Public Expenditure Review
(2004) and Country Economic Memorandum (2003) - focusing o n o i l and nahu-a1resource
nlanagement - are ongoing.

Annex C3 - Financing Parameters

D. Public Expenditure Management (PEM)
10.
Major deficiencies in accounting, reporting, control and treasury w a g e m e t i t
futlctions facilitated the extra-budgetary spending in 2003-04 and i t s concealment. Major
weakuesses in the PEM system hiclude the following:

11.
Budget Formulation. Budget covera,ee. The budget i s fiagmented into an operating
budget (LDF) - issued by the Ministry o f Finance - and a consolidated investment budget
(BCI). issued by the Ministry o f Economic Affairs and Development. Investment expenditure
financed by external resources (coiTespondinig to 45 percent of all investment expenditure in
2004) is included only hi the latter. Link MTEF-budget. The link between tlie budget and
Inedium-term estimates has deteriorated in recent time. Mauritania elaborated several sectoral
MTEF between during 2002-2004; aid finalized 8 global Iv€TEFin 2003. These important
inshments have not beai updated since 2004.
12.
Budget Execution and Reporting. Extm-budgetary spending. Recent evidence points
to the existence o f off-budget spending earlier than 2003, as compared to early indication that
a budget spree occur-r-ed just between Januruy 2003 and June 2004. Expenditure fmcking.
Financial supervision i s weak. Information on public expenditure at each stage of the process
i s not consolidated and. as a result, expenditure coiitrol i s difficult and its tracking remains
only partial. Fiscal I.eporting. Complete goveimnent accounting records have not been kept
for several years. and the Treaswy i s unable to prepare the monthly Treasury balance
necessary for preparation o f the consolidated fiscal reports (TOE). Fiscal reporting i s still
not computerized, although progress has been made in recent time.
13.
The goveimnent i s undertaking effort to stxengthen the PEM system. Efforts are
being taken to iniprove the presentation o f the budget, re-launch the MTEF process (and lhlk
it to the elaboration o f the second PRSP} and integrate it in the budget preparation
framework. The authorities have started to eliminate extra-budgetaiy spending, and are
takirig concrete steps to clear arrears. In addition, the periodic reconciliations o f data between
the Treasury and BCM have been initiated and should result in the production o f the treasury
balance on a regular basis. Public expenditure tracking surveys are ongoing to improve
tracking o f poverty spending.

E. Poverty and the PRSP
14.
Poverly. The incidence o f poverty declined substantially in recent years. I t i s
estimated that between 1990 and 2000 poverty fell &om 56.6 to 46.3 percent, a major
achievement. Recent evidence &om the EPCV 2004 @relirnhaiy results) shows that
monetary poverty f i u f l ~ e rdeclined to 42 percent in 2004. By contrast, inequality (Ghi)
increased fYom 0.35 hi 2000 to 0.39 in 2004. Analytical gaps exist as to whether the good

'

This program was ot-iginally articulated in the PRSC-1 (stopped) and the dialogue has continued in the
context of the preparation o f the public sector capacity building operation (PRECASP), which should be
approved in FY06. This p r o p m i s based on the conclusions and recoinmendation.. o f a iiuniber o f
analytical studies including the Country Proeureinent Assessment Review (CPAR, 1999). the Cowihy
Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA, 2002), the Report on the Observance of Standards mid Codes
(ROSC, 2002). the Cowihy Econonlic Memoraudum (CEM, 2003). the Riblic Expenditure Review (PER
2004) aud tlie HIPC Assessment aid Action Plan (AAP, 2005).

- 98 -

Annex C3 - Financing Parameters

poverty record can be ascribed to economic growth - in part stimulated by o i l and mining
activities - or greater volumes (andfor efficiency) o f public spending.
15.
Socinl Indicnfors. Significant improvements in social indicators have also been
realized. Between 2000 and 2004: (1) gross primary school enrollment rates increased from
88 to 96 percent: (ii)
under-5 vaccination rate increased from 40 to 93 percent: and
(iii)
access to niatenial health care increased from 65 to 80 percent. By contrast, the rate o f
retention inplimaiy schools declined &om 55 to 47.3 percent and little progress was made in
reducing child and infant mortality rates (NB. latest data are for 2001). %le Mauritania i s
relatively well placed to reach some o f tlie MDGs, i t i s unlikely that the bulk o f the health
and education-related goals unless resources to these sectors result in iinproved outcomes
amongst the poor and inthe most disadvantages areas.
PRSP Implementation. Mauritania developed its PRSP in February 2001 thou@ a
16.
broad participatoiy process. Since 2001 two PRSP FYogress Reports (PRs) have been
prepared in a participatory manner and endorsed by the Boards o f the Bretton Woods
institutions in June 2002 and July 2003 respectively. A third PRSP-PR was not fiualized in
2004 due to persisting uncertainty on key macroeconomic indicators in 2003 and 2004 (and
consequently on medium-tem projections). The staffs o f the IDA and the IMF consider that
Mauritania’s implementation o f i t s PRSP to date i s broadly satisfactory, iU spite of recent
slippages on macroeconomic performance. A full assessment o f tlie strategy - to be
conducted in the second PRSP - i s still pending.
17.
Next PRSP. The next P E P i s expected in 2006 - for the period 2006-2010 and
would do well to include a strategic vision for the o i l sector, including how to spend o i l
revenues to speed up progress on the achievement o f the MDGs while emuring consistency
with overall resource envelopes and maintaining macroeconomic stability.
18.
PRSP Iirplemenfnrioii Chnllenges. PRSP-PRs point to the Significant challenges of
Mauritania in its quest for growth and poverty redtiction, including: (i)the lack o f
diversification in the economy; (ii)
the country’s continued vulnerability to fluchiation in
exteinal demand for i t s exports and the vagaries o f the weather: (iii)
ongoing absorption
capacity constraints (especially as the corntry i s entering the o i l era); and (iv) the s t i l l
insufficient volume o f goveimnent investment in areashectors where most o f the poor
live/generate their income.2

19.
IDA Allocation. Mauritania relies heavily o n outside assistance for the
impfernentation o f i t s PRSP. The Bank i s one o f the most important donors in the country,
both in fmancial t e r m and for i t s advice and analytical services. In the past. the strong
yerfommce o f Mauritania enabled i t to benefit from a veiy high IDA allocation: for
example. Mauritania received US122.5 million hi IDA lendingin N 0 2 . Lending has
dropped in recent years iU line With the country’s achlal IDA allocations with no lending in
FY03. lending o f US$84 n i l l i o n in N O 4 and US$S4 million in FY05. I t will further drop in
the context o f IDA-I4 for which US$69 million equivalent has been allocated for FYOG-08.
due to the deterioration in economic management in Mauritania as reflected in the CPIA
rating between 2003 and 2004.

F. Bank Assistance Strategy and Portfolio

20.
The Old and New CAS. The World Bank supports tlie implementation o f the
govenunent’s PRSP through i t s Counhy Assistance Strategy (CAS. FY03-05 - extended to
cover FY06). The CAS program o f lending and non-lending operations was specifically
desipied to suppoit implementation o f €he four strategic axes o f the PRSP, with particular
emphasis on capacity building. In the CAS i t was assumed that a seiies o f PRSCs would
gradually become the main pillars o f the lending program, but this shift did not mateiialize as
a result o f the deteiioratioii o f niacroeconoinic management in 2003 and 2004.
21.
Dialogue has nevertheless continued on the r e f o r m envisaged under the PRSC,
notably in the sphere o f public expenditure inanageinent (i.e. PRECASP). Sectors included in
the PRSC-1 (i.e. health and nutrition, and water and sanitation) will benefit fiom Bank
investment projects hi FY06 and FY07. The next CAS (FYO7-10) will follow the f d i z a t i o n
o f the new PRSP. I t will continue to outline a Bank program that i s closely aligned with the
priorities o f the PRSP and will outline the Bank’s strategy for transitiotling to Mauritania’s
possible graduation froin IDA to IBRD.
22.
The Bank’s Portfolio. To date the WB has approved 69 projects in Mauritania for a
total o f US$1,019 inillion. The cu-rent portfolio has 9 operations for a total o f US$270.4
inillion, with t u undisbursed balance o f US$185.3 million as o f September 30, 2005. The
Bank’s program concentrates on rural developnient, urban development and social sector
operations. with other specific investments in growth-stimulating sectors, such as mining,
energy, and transport. Over the past few years, the Bank has been actively consolidating its
portfolio in Mauritania, decreasing the number o f projects fiom 13 in -02 to 9 in FY06 in
order to provide more focused and to deliver more stream-lined support.

23.
The portfolio i s also becoming more multi-sectoral with program in the iwal and
urban sectors tlmt cover many different sectors and sub-sectors. As the PRSCs &d not
materialize in the portfolio and as Mauritania undergoes a transition to a blend, arid eventual
LBRD country, the Bank will continue its investment projects in specific sectors that target
povei-fy reduction (such as health, education and water) and that support growth (such as
mi~iiiig.nml and CtgriCUlhU-al development).
24.
Perfomrotice of the Portfolio. The performance of Mauritania’s portfolio has been
traditionally strong but deteriorated in recent tine. The rate o f problein projects - 3 out o f 10
that is, 33 percent - i s above the Bank and Africa Region averages. Disbursenients have
evolved irregularly over tlie past few years increasing from 32 percent o f the total
conmihnent amount in FY02. to 36 percent in FY04, and then decreasing to 26 percent in
F Y O S . In the same way the lag disbusenient which i s the difference between real and
expected disbursement has s t i l l been very high for Mauritania and has evolved irregularly
those past few years: fiom 53 percent late in -02, it has decreased to 37.5 percent in FY04
but then has increased to 45 percent in FYOS.
25.
The new government has demonstrated a new willingness to improve its ownership
o f Bank-finance projects by working closely together with Bank staff on portfolio
management issues. Efforts have concentrated in particular on: (i)conceited capacity
building efforts; (ii)
review and refoim o f procurement procedures to make t h e m less heavy
and cumbersome; (iii)
greater delegation o f supervision to staff in the Nouakchott office to

- 100 -

Annex C3 - Financing Parameters

6
ensure more timely attention to project issues; and (iv) timely availability o f counterpart
full&. The Bank’s overall dialogue and AAA program in Mauritania i s also geared at
improving the overall system o f public fhance and transparency in the management o f
u p c o n i ~ i natural
g
resource revenues (oil and mining- see again footnote 1).
G. Cost Sharing

Current arrangements. Tlie Bank has established a minimumborrower cost sharing o f
i g inade on a case-by-case basis. For
10 percent, and decisions on the level o f cost s h a ~ i ~are
instance, in the case o f the Community-Based Rural Development project (CBRD) the
Govenment’s contribution i s ki the order o f 14 percent. Moving to 100 percent financing has
not been considered desirable given linlits on the IDA allocation and CAS lending scenarios.
While bilateral donors usually prefer to have a contribution &om the government, the EU
(one o f tlie biggest players in Mauritania) finances up to 100 percent.
26.

27.
Goveimiient ownership and conlrnitment to BaWs financed projects l n v e been
declining but recent developrneiits - detailed in paragraph 25 above - are encouraging. Inthe
past, the authorities l a v e made progress in linking budget spending to PRSP priorities,
through the MTEF process, but the process has stalled in recent months. As mentioned in
section E the implementatiou of the PRSP has been broadly satisfactory. And - through the
CAS - Bank projects have been closely aligned with PRSP priorities. Donors - hcluding the
Bank - have played a key role in supporting the Government’s PRSP implementation.
Donors finance around SO percent o f all investment spending in Mauritania, but this
proportion has been falling overtime.
28.
While the mival o f o i l resources i s expected to change the landscape dramatically in
Mauritania and result in increased public resources for fighting poverty, external support will
still be needed to ensure continued a smooth to the o i l era and a successful impleiuentation o f
the next PRSP.3
29.
Conclusiodrecomendation. As a general rule. the Bank will continue to fitlance up
to 90 percent of project costs. In the cases o f social sector projects as well as for possible
emergency projects such as the Locust Project, exceptions to the 90 percent limit nlay be
requested o f tlie RIP. However, this will depend on:

0

Project-level actions including, infer a l i a clear and established links with ongoing
national programs (e.g. health, education, nutrition); implementation up-&ont o f key
policy measures; active participation hi project preparation (including &om
beneficiaries and mer groups); integration o f kiplenientation arrangements into
sector ministries; clear links with the availability o f national resources in the national
budget; and, as a result, strengthenedproject ownership and commitment.
Improvements in the quality o f national budget management (budget formulation,
execution, and monitoring) as measured by implementing the actions presented in
paragraph 13).

Oil revenues should come on stream in 1006. However. Mauritania m y iiot benefit fioni tlie substantial
payment of EU fishing agreement fees in 2006 (€82ni). The year 2006 could therefore still be considereda
transition year for Maiuitania, where exteinal assistance will be needed to close the financing gap. A
budget support operation could thus be feasible in 2006.

- 101 -

Annex C3 - Financing Parameters

Sustained improvement on the perfoimance o f Bank-fuianced projects. This
p e r f o i m c e will be measured every 3 m o n t h in the Quarterly Perfonwince Report,
which covers the 4 types of indicators: results, alignment, risk and efficiency. A
series o f measures and commitments lmve been taken axid will be monitored through
a global matrix which is part o f the report to improve tlie portfolio peifoiinance.
Evidence o f implementation o f these measures will be taken into account before
accepting 100% financing.
H. Recurrent Costs Financing

30.
Cunait airanaements. In Mauritania, the Bank (and other donors) have been
finaicing recurrent costs, mainly in the context o f capacity building programs, and operating
costs o f Project Implementation Units (PIUs, salaries and materials). Maintenance in
infkastnicture programs i s usually not fitlanced by the Bank, but by the national budget.4
Other than that the state budget (portion financed by own resources) covers the bulk o f
recurrent costs. In projects approved from FYO1-05 onwards, approximately 5-10 percent o f
IDA commitments were for recurrent costs. Mauritania's track record o n the sustainability of
previous projects i s good with positive assessments from the Bank team and OED on
sustainability o f project activities.
3 1.
Recurrent costs are properly taken into account inthe budget preparation process and
usidly tlie execution of such expenditure occurs relatively smoothly. However, in 2003 and
2004 there were some difficulties in mobilkbig g o v a n m a t countelpart funds, slowing down
the inipleinentation o f projects although. in these cases, counterpart fimds were eventually
secured. The situation did not significantly c h i g e in 2005, but tlie budget 2006 i s the most
comprehensive and transparent t o date, including the treatment o f oil (performance will be
closely monitored in 2006). It is expected that the m i v a l o f o i l revenues into the Government
budget in 2006 will alleviate some o f the difficulties hi mobilizing coiuterpart fbtids, but tlie
Bank still expects to cover some recurrent costs for capacity building programs and for some
PIUs, before they are phased out.

32.
In t e r m of investment spending, financing from o w n resoilfces increased
considerably ki recent years. The proportioii o f the BCI (investment budget - programmed
resources) fuianced by own resources increased from 13.2 to 40.7 percent over the period
1998-2002. and preliminary indications show that this trend i s continuing. This phenomenon
i s welcomed, in that it is desirable that the development goals o f the cowiby will be
progressively funded though the tax and non-tax revenue that the State is capable to generate
o n its own. Investment expenditure f m n c e d by external resources has stayed broadly
constant over the period 1998-2002 (N.B. data since then are under examitlation).
33.
Exteinal debt. With respect to the need for external financial resources, two aspects
need to be considered: (i)
Mauritania successfully reached the HIPC-CP in June 2002. The
net present value o f Mauritania's total external debt was reduced by some 50 percent. Debt
seivice payments were cut substantially-from about US$88 million in 1998 to an expected
average o f US$35 million in 2003, and will average approximately US$30 million per year

However. national resoimes to maintain infrastructure are often not sufficient and cause rapid
deterioratioti. Some donors, such as the EU in the road sector, do cover tmintenance costs.

- 102 -

Annex C3 - Financing Parameters

over 2002-201 1.5 Recent debt sustainability analysis shows a fiu-ther positive evolution o f the
nxtin debt indicators, as Mauritania will benefit from oil revenues starting in 200G.6
34.
Eligibility to GS hhdtilaternl Debt Initiative. Contrary to the Fund staffs
recommendation. which stated that a G-iiioiith track record under an S M P followed by a 6month track record under a PRGF was necessary before Mauritania could be eligible. the
IMF Board decided that Mauritania could qual@ for debt relief within 6 months (NB. The
Bauli‘s Board on the MDFU i s in March 2006). Executive Directors agreed that the country
needs to take remedial measures, namely sound macro policies over a period o f 6 months,
actions on budget foimulation and execution (see p a r a p p h 13) and resolution o f data issues
with the Fund.
35.
Conclusions and recommendations. Ivlauritania will continue to depend o n external
help for the financing o f reciuxent costs. but possibly only for a limited t h e (2006, possibly
2007). Given tlie recent improvements, f o r the present i t i s proposed to maintain the “no
country financing linit” on recurrent cost financing. However, the Bank should b e
cautious about financing recurrent costs inMauritania given the weak macro management
and the other factors behind the deterioration o f the CPIA. Hence this parameter will b e
reviewed eveiy six-months, paying particular attention to the budget situation. In
deteiiiiining Bank financing o f reciuxent costs in individual projects, the Bank will take into
account sustainability issues at the sector and project levels.
I.Local Cost Financing

36.
Cuxent aiTane;enients. InMauritania, the Bank has typically supported 100 percent o f
foreign expendinwes while it has financed local expenditures at 85-90 percent in recent years.
Generally, disbursements against local costs were 75 percent, 73 percent, and 70 percent o f
total investment lending disbwsenients in FY02, FY03 and FY04 respectively. This
proportion i s high and varies only slightly f r o m year to year, thus underlining the importance
o f local cost fniancing by the Bank.
37.
Finnncing Gaps. Uncertainty persists on whether fmaicing requirextients for the
c o u n t ~’sy development program would exceed the public sector’s own resources and
expected domestic bonowitig in the future. In 2005. the (residual) financing gap is around
U S 1 5 million, and m y increase to U S 4 0 million in 2006. These gaps will be financed by
the drawing down o f BCM foreign exchange reserves, in the absence o f any budget support
operation from the Bank or bilateral donor. The fmancing gaps for 2006 aid beyond (if any)
are clearly closely related to the authorities’ decisions on how much oil revenues to chamel
into tlie budget (as opposed to saving them into an o i l fund), the international price o f oil, as
well as the negotiation o f a new fishing agreement with the EU.

38.
For projects in the current portfolio or in the pipeline, Bank’s fulanchg of foreign
expeiiditures alone would not be suEcient to meet the developnient objectives o f tlie counhy.
Tllis i s obvious for the Coumunity Driven Development (CDD) projects, the Urban

T h i s refers to debt senice after HIPC assistmice to the Bank, IMF and Afiican Development Bank
(AfDB). Clearly, access to tlie G8 initiative will wipe out this part o f the debt, as it will fall to zero.
The post-relief debt-to-export aid debt senice-to-export ratios are 101.7 and 5.4 respectively.

Development Project and the Humau Development projects (Educatioii. Health and
Nutrition), which entail a high share of local costs at the community level.
39.

Conclusiodrecomndation. Mauritania nieets the two criteria for Bank fniancing o f

local expenditures. Therefore, the Bank may finance local costs in any proportion needed in

individual projects.
J. Taxes aud Duties

40.

Current mangeiiients. Financing o f taxes and duties are prohibited.

41.
Taxes in Mauritania cannot be considered excessive. Measures have been taken to
diversify and simplify the tax system, improve tax and custom administration, and broaden
the tax base. Since 2002 the indirect tax system has been simplified through the unification o f
VAT rates (14 percent) and the elimination o f VAT exemptions, except for those items that
are essential for the poor. Additional main (income) taxes include: (corporate) the Tax on
Industrial and Commercial Profits @IC, 25%), the Minimum Presumptive T a x (IMF,
100% deductible); and (personal) the Tax on Iricotne from Property (IRF, 6 percent), the
Taxes on Wages and Salaries (ITS, progressive, 15-40%), and the General Income Tax

(IGR, 540%).
42.
Quantitative import restrictions md price controls have been eliminated and f o r e i p
trade liberalized. albeit with a system of import surveillance. Trade policy was liberalized
significautly in recent years. The number o f t a i i f f bands was reduced to four, with the
inaximum tariff set at 20 percent. The average taiff rate was estimated at about 13 percent in
2002. Mauritania has also hamonized its tariff shxichxe with the WAEMU countries. The
index o f trade policy restrictiveness coiiipiled by Fund Staff i s estimated at 2 on a scale o f 1
to 10, with 1 indicating complete openness, and 10 indicating complete reshictiveness. Bankfmanced projects are taxed at the same rates as the country’s i i o i m l rates.’

43.
Coiiclusiodrecoiimendation: The Bank may fmance taxes and import duties as long
as they remain reasonable and non-discriminatory. In appraising each project, the Balk
would consider whether taxes and duties constitute an excessively high share o f projects
costs.

’ In the budget law 2006. t a r i f f s on over a liundred products have been reduced in order to allow the
customs; administration to increaserevenueby applying a reasonable mte and lower tariff evasion.

Annex C5. Mauritania CAS: Summary o f Consultations

1. Introduction
The following background information describes a central aspect o f the 2007-1 1 Mauritania CAS design
and future implementation: the collaborative process to define a most effective country assistance
strategy.

With the coup d’Ctat in August 2005 and the establishment o f a new transition government-the Military
Council for Justice and Democracy-Mauritania embarked on an ambitious reform program with three
major focal points. They are the (1) return to democracy, (b) improvement o f the judicial system, and (c)
deepening o f reforms in the public financial sphere. Furthermore, in February 2006, Mauritania became
an oil-producing country so will benefit from additional revenues.
T o ensure a continuation on this promising path, Mauritania took a collaborative approach to define
country assistance. The collaborative CAS i s an innovative approach and opportunity for the country to
define a most effective strategy in collaboration with donors, the government, c i v i l society, and other key
stakeholders. The detailed consultations enabled sociocultural dimensions to be taken into account to
better understand the needs o f the country. Moreover, most development partners elaborated their
assistance strategies at the same time as the CAS was being prepared.

In addition to individual consultations, the Bank coordinated common consultations with all the key
development actors mentioned above, most notably through launching and advancement workshops in
March and June 2006. All partners were closely involved in diagnosing the country context, development
challenges, and related analytical gaps as well as defining key objectives and targeted results.
The C A S consultation workshops were launched to follow up the early 2006 release o f the CAS
Completion Report (CASCR), which presented the conclusions and experiences o f Bank activities carried
out during the last CAS (FY2003-05). As a key input from which to draw o n previous lessons learned,
the CASCR was transmitted to all partners and commented on by almost all o f them.

2. Launching Workshop Based n PRSP Strategic Pillars
After several CAS presentations and engagement meetings with partners, civil society, and the
government, the launching workshop took place on March 15-16, 2006. The workshop convened almost
200 participants via video conference with Washington, Paris, and Nouakchott. Attending were
representatives from 10 donors’ organizations, 20 ministries, and civil society. The main objectives o f the
workshop were to: (a) initiate reflections and discourse on the CAS among the different groupings; and
(b) identify and agree on the first key areas to be elaborated during the CAS process. The workshop was
divided into three sessions.
Session 1: Plenary Discussion on Context

Introductory presentations on the country and aid context for Mauritania provided background
information and set the stage for the discussions on the new CAS for FY08-11.

.

The first presentation o n the previous CAS and CASCR reviewed the main objectives and lessons
learned from the Bank’s past country assistance and presented the timeline for the new
collaborative CAS.
The second presentation discussed conclusions from PRSP-1 and the key strategic pillars o f
PRSP-2, highlighting that the new CAS i s aligned with these objectives.
The last presentation focused o n Mauritania’s socioeconomic and cultural development. It was
well received by participants as a critical input to further discussions. Prepared by Professor
Abdelwedoud Ould Cheikh, the report highlighted four important points: (1) Mauritania’s
demographic structures; (2) ethnic, tribal, and social classes; (3) State characteristics and types o f
power; and (4) probable impact o f the o i l resources.

Session 2: Break-out Working Groups by Pillar
Following the plenary, participants were divided into four subgroups with several smaller break-out
groups. The objective o f these group discussions was to develop matrices on: (1) past results and
constraints o f PRSP1; (2) objectives and operations proposed for the new CAS; and (3) prioritization o f
those operations. Preliminary work and background information prepared by the Bank team supported
discussions and helped complete the first matrix. Team leaders were assigned to each small group to lead
discussions o n each PRSP pillar.
Four break-out groups were established based on the first four pillars o f the PRSP-2:
Pillar 1. Accelerate growth and maintain macroeconomic equilibrium
Pillar 2. Anchor growth in the economic environment o f the poor
Pillar 3. Develop human resources and generalize access t o basic social services
Pillar 4. Strengthen good governance and capacity building

Session 3: Plenary Discussion on Conclusions and Next Steps

Back in the plenary, each group summarized the key challenges and strategic objectives identified for
each pillar. In concluding, a global synthesis and recommendations were given to further develop PRSP-2
and CAS.

3. Advancement Workshop Based on PRSP Strategic Pillars
The second multicountry workshop, which joined Nouakchott, Washington DC, Paris, and Rome, took
placed o n June 22 2006 to follow up the launching workshop. I t convened representatives from civil
society, the private sector (including IFC and the President o f the Mauritanian Employers), the
government, and other donors (including AfDB, JICA, AFD Paris, and FAD Rome). The government
was represented by the Ministry o f Economics Affairs and Development (MAED), Ministry o f Finance
(MF), and Governor o f the Central Bank o f Mauritania (BCM). The main objectives were to: (1) update
partners on the CAS progress and (2) gather feedback to finalize the Bank’s strategy. The workshop was
divided into five plenary sessions.
Session 1: PRSP-2MTEF Review

The first presentation highlighted that, while the Medium-Tern Expenditure Framework (MTEF) i s
elaborated under constraints, PRSP-2 i s formulated on the basis o f sectoral demands. Aligning the two
shows the total distribution o f public expenditures by pillar and by sector, highlightingthe shares o f state
financing, external financing, as well as remaining financing gaps and perspectives for the global MTEF.

Session 2: Alignment of the CASLPRSP, monitoring and evaluation, and harmonization of donor
assistance
The second discussion focused on: (a) better harmonization o f donor assistance; and (b) alignment o f
operations with country development strategies. Particular focus was also given to: (c) the PRSP-2
monitoring and evaluation tool. The government articulated i t s commitment to integrate the action plan o f
the 2005 Paris Declaration o n Harmonization and Aid Effectiveness into PRSP-2 monitoring. government
representatives also highlighted that putting technical working group 5 in charge o f M&E will ensure a
sound monitoring framework for PRSP-2 indicators.
Session 3: Results-Based CAS (RBCAS) Framework

The third session introduced the logical framework o f the Results-Based CAS (RBCAS), the Bank’s new
approach geared to making i t s Country Assistance Strategies more results oriented. This new approach
focuses on M&E o f Bank development contributions and performance. The Bank representative
highlighted that this framework clearly articulates expected Bank results in relation to national
development objectives and activities supported by other technical and financial partners (TFPs).
Session 4: Summary of the Three First Sessionsfor DC Participants

A summary o f the first three presentations was provided to participants in Washington, DC, with the
opportunity to discuss follow-up questions.
Session 5: Discussions by Strategic Pillar

The last session reviewed PRSP financing needs by pillar and strategic sector positioning o f partners. The
session highlighted financing gaps that are covered by neither public expenditures nor donor funding.

.

.

Pillar I.Accelerate growth and maintain macroeconomic equilibrium
Although numerous donors are present in Mauritania, little financing i s available. The exceptions
are the World Bank, AFD, and EU, which plays a predominant role in this pillar through i t s
notable presence in the transport sector.
Pillar 2. Anchor growth in the economic environment of thepoor
A similar number o f donors are involved in this pillar, but they are providing significantly more
financing. The assistance o f the World Bank i s dominant in this pillar.
Pillar 3. Develop human resources and generalize access to basic social services
Most donors present in Mauritania engage in this pillar. Interventions o f the W o r l d Bank, AFD,
and JICA are key.
Pillar 4. Strengthen good governance and capacity building
UNDP is very present in this area and provides 65% of total funding.

4. Main Conclusions and Messages
The TFPs find the main development objectives o f PRSP-2 appropriate and in line with their assistance
strategies. They agree that PRSP-2 needs to take into account regional integration and the role o f the
private sector. The TFPs strongly encourage the government to give priority t o the governance pillar,
which i s key to increase performance and effectiveness o f all the other pillars.
The collaborative CAS i s well aligned with PRSP. Furthermore, the CAS i s recognized by the other TFPs
as an important tool to harmonize and align interventions. Additional work i s needed to best integrate

- 109 -

Annex C5 - Mauritania CAS: Summary o f Consultations

technical and financial information, most notably at the level o f the results and indicator framework. The
TFPs encouraged the government to be closely engaged in the collaborative process, assume a lead role in
harmonization efforts as per the Paris Declaration, and coordinate with partners to finalize PRSP-2 to
ensure the greatest aid effectiveness and alignment with country priorities.
The TFPs fully support the finalization and approval o f the collaborative C A S according to a agreed
timeline that takes into account varying planning horizons.

5. Civil Society Involvement in the C A S Preparation
As a first step in the consultation, the Bank invited civil society organization (CSO) representatives to
discuss the process, CAS content, and inputs expected from the CSOs. T o this end, in February 2006.
several meetings were held at the civil society “cyberforum”-CSOs union-and at the Bank to discuss
the CASCR and the CAS concept note. The second step was to constitute a focal working group made up
o f nongovernmental organization (NGO) representatives, trade unionists, and academics. Then, the
“cyberforum” designated CSO representatives to be part o f the various working groups constituted for the
C A S workshops. In each group, 3 CSO representatives took part in the common work. One group was
headed by a CSO representative, and one o f the reports selected as a basis for discussion had been written
by civil society members.

Annex C6 - Mauritania’s Economic Fundamentals and Medium-Term Macro Options

Mauritania’s Economic Fundamentals and Medium-Term Macro Options

Economic Management during the Oil Era
Against the background o f the recent improvements in the economic management framework, the
beginning o f the o i l era occurred in a relatively stable macroeconomic and budgetary environment.
However, due to decades o f dependence on revenues from natural resources (fisheries and iron ore),
Mauritania’s initial conditions s t i l l display important weaknesses, They underline the importance of
policy measures tot enable Mauritania to make effective use o f the projected increase in mineral
rents. What choices really matter now? The C E M Update recommendations focus on six domains o f
intervention:
Get the Macroeconomic Basics Right
Countries rich in non-renewable resources face two key problems: (1) uncertainty and volatility o f
the resource stream and (2) exhaustible nature o f the resource. These problems raise important
challenges for economic policy in general and fiscal policy in particular. One o f the challenges
consists o f simultaneously targeting realistic spending objectives (in line with PRSP-2 priorities as
w e l l as public absorption capacities), while limiting volatility and, together with monetary and
exchange rate policies, coping with Dutch Disease pressures.
In the short run, the challenge i s to minimize the correlation between govemment spending and the
volatility o f o i l prices by smoothing fiscal expenditure and avoiding abrupt changes in government
spending and non-oil deficits. This approach implies eliminating expansionary fiscal policy biases
during o i l booms and targeting prudent non-oil fiscal balances to reduce the non-oil fiscal deficit over
time.

In the medium term, the government should aim for an (overall) fiscal surplus, especially given that
sound systems to spend public money are not yet in place. In addition, to stabilize expenditure over
time, the government should establish a medium-term smoothing r u l e for o i l revenue utilization.
From a long-term perspective, the authorities should pay particular attention to a sustainable non-oil
primary deficit. Choosing this amount sets a simple and transparent rule for the level o f expenditures
financed from o i l revenue consistent with long-term savings objectives.

Strengthen the Framework to Manage Natural Resource Revenues
The government o f Mauritania has made good progress in setting up an institutional framework for
the transparent management o f o i l revenues, which are treated transparently in the 2006 and 2007
budgets. The authorities have engaged in prudent fiscal and monetary policies and set up the National
Hydrocarbon Revenue Fund (FNRH). The government also created a National Oil Company (SMH),
and adhered to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and agreed to implement all
i t s steps. Finally, the government sought support and TA in the o i l sector and in the management o f
o i l revenues from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.

- 111 -

Annex C6 - Mauritania’s Economic Fundamentals and Medium-TermMacro Options

However, the overall legal framework and procedures need strengthening. The links between the
FNRH and the annual budgets and the medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) need to be
clearly defined. The surveillance role o f Parliament (after the November 2006 elections) over the use
o f the resources o f the o i l fund i s to be stressed. The government also needs to establish clear
guidelines, based o n a long-term fiscal strategy, to transfer resources from the FNRH to the budget.
The authorities should formulate an Oil Sector Policy Letter and elaborate and adopt a Hydrocarbon
Law.
In addition, the role o f the newly formed state o i l corporation, SMH, should be clarified and i t s
commercial mandate safeguarded and made paramount. These steps are necessary to prevent
leakages o f funds from the commercial enterprise into the political patronage system. The Parliament
could approve the budget o f SMH in conjunction with the state budget annually. Moreover, the
audited accounts o f the contracts to which S M H i s party, o n behalf o f the state, could be published to
make transparent the SMH assets and liabilities.

On the EITI front, near-term priorities for action include: (a) facilitating the task o f the international
auditor to launch the reconciliation o f revenue figures; (b) training civil society representatives on
basic o i l industry and macroeconomic concepts; (c) preparing the 2005 audit report on Mauritanian
State Mining Company (SNIM) and the 2006 report on o i l and mining companies; and (d) launching
the communication campaign to manage the expectations o f the general public. EITI reports should
be publicly disclosed.
I n vest Judiciously in Priority Areas

Given the need to reduce the country’s 46.7 percent poverty headcount, Mauritania faces
considerable pressure to use o i l revenues to rapidly boost social expenditures. However, the overrapid absorption of a natural resource rent stream that will emerge quickly but be relatively shortlived poses severe risks to the political economy. The Mauritanian government can learn from
successful resource-rich countries such as Malaysia, which matched the rent flow to domestic
absorptive capacity.
Nevertheless, public spending could increase quite dramatically if propelled by political decisions.
Policy-makers have a number o f options: (a) use accumulated o i l revenues to expand public
investment in infrastructure to directly propel non-oil sector growth; (b) distribute o i l windfalls to
households to bolster incomes and domestic demand growth, while possibly ensuring a better
stabilization mechanism against o i l revenue volatility; and (c) save part o f the o i l windfalls for the
future. In the Mauritanian context, a combination o f options 1 and 3 seems to be the most
appropriate.
Mauritania needs infrastructure, but i t s territory i s vast and i t s population dispersed. Policy-makers
should develop a long-term priority investment plan. A public sector investment evaluation unit can
compare prospective returns to alternative applications o f the rent, while an audit unit can hunt out
corruption in the award o f contracts and during construction. A two-hurdle system can be set up to
evaluate investment projects: (1) assess the economic rate o f return o f a project; and (2) assess the
honesty o f the procurement process. In the medium-term, the MTEF should guide the investment
decisions o f the authorities.

Annex C6 - Mauritania’s Economic Fundamentals and Medium-TermMacro Options

Focus on the Political Economy and Prevent Rent-Seekiag Activities

The current government o f Mauritania took power in August 2005 through a bloodless coup d’ktat.
Early on, the new government indicated i t s intention to restore democracy and has set out an
ambitious timetable, culminating in new presidential elections in March 2007. During this period o f
transition to democratic politics, the new authorities managed to improve the social consensus toward
development by being more transparent on both the political and economic fronts. T o cement the
recent progress, government follow-through on i t s promises i s critical.
The transition authorities should deliver o n the four policies endorsed in the Road Map. These are to:
(1) combat corruption, thus following through on the government’s open recognition o f this problem
and i t s plans to elaborate a national Anticorruption Strategy within the transition period;
(2) strengthen the judicial system to establish a fairer system for individuals and an attractive
investment climate for businesses; (3) foster public sector governance by reviewing the regulatory
framework affecting civil servants’ behavior and deepening public financial management reforms
(especially procurement); and (4) improve the social consensus on the use o f o i l revenues.
Paradoxically, the transition to a democratic rule can intensib rent-seeking activities as politicians
compete with each other through rival patronage networks. Patronage can be limited by: (1) setting
up checks and balances o n h o w public revenues are used. These protections include informal
institutional arrangements, such as a free and informed media and engaged civil society groups;
(2) limiting the extent to which political campaigns are financed with the o i l revenues; and
(3) improving citizens’ information, particularly the potential o f o i l revenues to improve public
service provision. Patronage thrives on the citizens’ ignorance.

Build Capacity to Appropriately Manage the Petroleum Sector
Building national capacity includes training local personnel who will progressively be able to
elaborate and put in place a clear legal, regulatory, and contractual framework. Such a framework
should: (a) emphasize the government’s objective o f maximizing the positive impact o f the o i l and
gas sectors o n overall economic development; and (b) translate into petroleum laws, regulations,
contracts, and institutions that promote foreign and domestic direct investment and competition. The
government will need to pay proper attention to environmental management, especially since
offshore fishing represents a sizable share o f the country’s exports.
At the same time, the authorities will need to gradually build up the institutions responsible for o i l
sector management in accordance with the o i l sector policy, affer it i s adopted. Oil exploration and
production generate a large number o f seismic, economic, financial, and environmental data. The
near-term agenda includes: (a) setting up the reporting system and training staff who will be
responsible to prepare monthly reports on hydrocarbon production and sales; (b) updating o i l
production and revenue projections; and (c) continuing to implement the EITI recommendations.
Revive the Non-Oil Economy
Realistically, over the medium term, Mauritania will continue to depend primarily on mining and
fishing as the two main (non-oil) sources o f growth. Without massive investment in important
infrastructure and services, there i s little chance that the country would be able to diversify i t s
economic and export base in a meaningful way. The experiences o f the former centrally planned,
low-income economies suggests that dual-track reform offers a more politically practical way o f

- 113 -

Annex C6 - Mauritania’s Economic Fundamentals and Medium-TermMacro Options

reorienting the distribution o f rent toward sustainable growth that i s pro-poor than does either rapid
or gradual economic reform o n i t s own.
The dual-track strategy creates a dynamic market economy within the neglected rural economy (track
one), while incrementally promoting politically sensitive reform o f the largely rent-driven urban
economy (track two). However, the dual-track strategy - and the economic restructuring and political
realignment that it entails - requires a favorable environment for private sector growth and sound
institutions to manage public resources. They could be achieved by: (a) creating an enabling
environment for the private sector, also by restructuring the financial sector; (b) improving public
sector governance; (c) building capacity in the public administration; and (d) improving the
management o f public expenditure.

At the sectoral level, the CEM suggests that the growth agenda would be boosted if the authorities
focused o n the following priorities: (a) intensifylng cropping activity and raising commercial returns
to livestock herding, which are shown to have substantial potential; (b) expanding niche tourism in
rural centers; (c) encouraging manufacturing growth in agroprocessing and fisheries; (d) boosting the
rise o f a national fisheries industry; and (e) reforming the rent-driven urban sector. In so doing,
substantial inroads could be made in implementing the dual-track strategy.

Governance and Corruption in Mauritania

1.

The National Governance System

Despite the preparation o f a National Program for Good Governance (PNBG) in 200 1, a key component
o f the transition authority’s “road map” towards democracy, Mauritania’s governance system i s
characterized by weak institutions, a lack o f transparency and inadequate accountability mechanisms.
Recent reforms have resulted in progress, notably in the areas o f public expenditure management,
freedom o f the media, and political accountability.

1.1

Formal Oversight Institutions
0

Parliament: Parliament i s comprised o f two chambers: the National Assembly and the
Senate. Despite reforms in 2001 and clear constitutional separation o f legislative and
executive powers, parliament “remains an appendage to the executive”. An integral part o f
the transition to democracy, recent parliamentary elections were deemed fair and just by
international observers. However, the capacity o f parliament to act as an effective check o n
the executive branch remains limited.
The PNl3G calls for a strengthening o f the parliament’s human resources. Training and
technical assistance to Parliament members i s being provided by Germans. A project in
support o f parliament has been prepared by P N R C / O (National Capacity Building
P r o g r a d Mauritanian Policy Analysis Center) and i s proposed t o be financed by the African
Capacity Building Foundation (PRSP-2).

0

Judiciary: Mauritania’s courts are considered to be among the most corrupt institutions in
the country. A report by an Inter-Ministerial Committee concluded that “the phenomenon of
corruption has evolved significantly over the last years, encouraged by a feeling o f general
impunity and promoted by the precariousness o f the justices’ and court personnel’s living
conditions, as well as by the substantial fall in their revenues” (report by the Inter-ministerial
Committee, 2005). Rather than being a symbol o f law and order, courts are therefore seen as
part o f the problem - not only do they not enforce laws (thereby protecting citizens from the
corrupt behavior o f others), but they themselves can be bought o f f to influence the outcome
o f a case.
The Inter-ministerial Committee produced a comprehensive report in November 2005,
including recommendations in three key areas: (i)independence o f the judiciary and legal
human resources and training; and (iii)
infrastructure and modernization o f the
reform; (ii)
judiciary. Actions taken by the Government to improve the situation include the adoption o f
the Commerce Code, the Arbitration Code, and additional laws and regulations governing
judicial officers, as well as training o f judges and constructing and equipping judicial
facilities. The progress o f these reforms has been limited and the following further actions are
planned (PRSP-2):
o Training institute for members o f the bench and court personnel.
o Creating a monitoring and evaluation system for judges and officers.
o Computerization in the courtroom and court administration.
o Continuing the codification and revision o f legal texts to include (among other
key laws) anti-corruption laws.
o Greater transparency through publication o f relevant court documents.
o Preparation o f a MTEF for the justice sector.

1.2

Audit: Building the capacity o f budgetary oversight institutions i s urgently needed.
Systems and procedures need to be updated to strengthen accounting and reporting functions.
Internal and external control mechanisms (including audits) need to be improved by
strengthening the relevant institutions (State General Inspectorate, Audit Office, Finance
General Inspectorate). Priority for actions include:
o Completing a legal framework for the Audit Office, and making the annual reports
available to the public.
o Improving the initiative and resources o f the Inspectorate General o f Finance to
prepare and execute internal audit programs, as well as improving the resources o f
the Inspectorate General o f State.
o Improving accounting standards and introducing an institutional mechanism for
evaluating public policies.

Public Sector Management

The public administration system has many systemic weaknesses which hinder good governance. These
weaknesses include bureaucratic inertia, arbitrary decision-making, a lack o f transparency, corruption,
and inefficient management o f human resources and new technology. Despite these weaknesses, the
Governance Matters indicator on government effectiveness ranks Mauritania in the 49* percentile -- far
above the regional average.
e

Public Manapement Svstems:
o Civil Sewice: The administration’s human resource management i s weak, primarily
because it i s based on an outdated and poorly adapted model. The civil service i s also
characterized by lack o f transparency and lax controls for recruitment, amount o f
remuneration, j o b definitions, and financing (at central, project and local levels). The
management o f salaries as well as human resources i s overly centralized at the
Directorate o f Civil Service and Administrative Reform (DGFPRA) and Directorate
o f Budget and Accounting (DBC) Pay Unit and involves multiple layers, each
decision regarding career management requiring approval o f five different entities,
including the President’s Office. Computerized management systems at DGFPRA
and DBC-Pay Unit level are outdated and not operational. A public sector ethics code
has recently been adopted by the Council o f Ministers.
The PRSP-2 foresees the following actions in this area: (i)Strengthening the
institutional and organizational framework by adopting a general state organization
chart, clarifying missions o f the various departments and employees, and
standardizing rules and regulations; (ii)
Reforming human resources by promoting
equal access to jobs, increasing the general qualification and s k i l l levels o f
employees, strengthening the compensation system, institutionalizing clear career
promotion steps, and improving working conditions in order to attract, train, and
retain qualified personnel as well as to reduce corruption among public
administration employees.
o Public financial management: Between 2000 and 2005, Mauritania engaged in
rampant off-budget spending and data misreporting that was uncovered in 2004. T h i s
clearly showed the inadequacies o f the public financial management system. The
transition authorities implemented a number o f important measures, including: (i)
a
stop to extra-budgetary spending; (iii)
preparation o f monthly treasury balances and

- 116 -

Annex C7 - Governance and Corruption in Mauritania

reconciliation o f fiscal accounts with the Central Bank (BCM); (iv) introduction o f a
functional classification for public expenditure tracking. It has also begun to
progressively decentralize budget control to the ministerial level. The new
Automated Expenditure Chain Network (RACHAD), put in place in November 2005
on a pilot basis, integrates all budget execution procedures, as well as parameters
relating to the country’s fiscal environment. I t i s expected to become fully
operational in 2007.
The PRSP-2 foresees the following actions in the area o f public financial
management: (i)
Increasing the use o f electronic records for tracking payroll and
expenditures on goods and services, adopting a budget review law and the Budget
Execution L a w in 2001, strengthening the institutional framework o f the tax
administration. (ii)Implementing a competitive bidding system and strengthening
government procurement regulations.

Management o f extractive industries sector: Several actions taken by the Government
since August 2005 confirm their commitment t o strengthen economic governance in the
sector, by: (i)
treating o i l in a transparent way in the 2006 and 2007 budgets and engaging in
prudent fiscal and monetary policies; (ii)
setting up the National Hydrocarbon Revenue Fund
(NHW); (iii)adhering to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI),
implementing i t s steps in partnership with c i v i l society and o i l companies; and (iv) seeking
support and technical assistance in the o i l sector from the World Bank (WB). These steps
symbolize a clear break from past practices.
The overall legal framework and procedures concerning o i l need to be strengthened. In
particular: (i)
the links between the NHRF and the annual budgets need to be clearly defined:
(ii)the surveillance role o f parliament over the use o f the o i l fund i s to be stressed;
(iiiprocedures
)
with regard to the NHRF revenue (most notably, tax revenue) assessment,
collection, and certification should be strengthened at the level o f the General Tax Directorate
(GTD); and (iv) the investment approach envisioned for the NHRF resources should be
developed as the fund’s assets grow.

Local Participation
0

Decentralization: Since i t s inception in 1986, the decentralization policy has made little
headway. Independent cities, a few spread out ministry units and an existing but inefficient
regional development fund only constitute the starting point o f a slow process. This poor
performance i s due to an insufficient political will and the absence o f a global vision leading
to a weak and poorly equipped department in charge o f decentralization o f the General
Direction of Local Communities. A number o f donors have been working o n this subject
without clear leadership or effective coordination. (CAS). The Government has put in
significant amount o f work into financing municipalities through the Regional Development
Fund (FRD) but the functioning o f municipalities has been hampered by: shortage o f
qualified personnel; weak finances; and poor cooperation between the Mayors and local
councils (PRSP-2). The PRSP-2 outlines several actions that will be taken to build capacity
and participatory democracy, mobilizing additional resources for communes, community
development plans, and further decentralization.
Communitv Driven DeveloDment (CDD): Government policies have started to recognize
community-driven activities. A number o f donor-funded projects operate on a CDD platform,

- 117 -

Annex C7 - Governance and Corruption in Mauritania

including the Community-Based Rural Development Project (CBRD), which intervenes in
141 rural communes in 10 regions o f Mauritania, targeting village community associations.
Despite these individual initiatives, there i s currently n o national-level architecture for CDD
to tackle issues such as local development and decentralization.

1.4

Civil Society and M e d i a
0

Civil Societv Orpanizations: According to the PRSP-2, the NGO capacity to participate in
development activities continues to be hampered by a lack o f professionalism and expertise,
fragmentation and lack o f permanent financing sources. Even though the transition process i s
an opportunity for the CSOs to participate in the public debate, the communication between
CSOs and Government i s inadequate. There have recently been some good examples o f
capacity building o f national civil society organizations, particularly NGOs, through
partnerships between bilateral donors (Spain and EU) and national NGOs. The Spanish
Agency for International Cooperation (AECI), for instance, implements almost 40 projects in
a wide range o f sectors with the help o f 13 resident Spanish N o n Governmental
Organizations (NGOs). The EU has a US$7 million program to support NGO capacity
building. However, a more strategic, programmatic approach i s required in order to address
the institutional development and training needs o f national civil society representatives in
Mauritania. Recent and planned initiatives to strengthen NGOs and media organizations
include:
o Capacity building programs and the strengthening o f the legal framework.
o Efforts to professionalize NGOs through the introduction o f the Cyberfomm, which
allows organizations access to new information and communication technologies.
o Revising the procedures for granting development association status.
o Introducing a National NGO Professionalization Support Fund
o Providing technical and logistical support to the Cyberfomm.
o Involvement o f NGOs in policy dialogue and grass-roots development under the new
Participatory Approach o f the new Government.

Media. According to the Reporters Without Borders 2006 annual report o n Mauritania, under
the Taya regime arrests o f journalists, articles cut out, publications banned, an omnipresent
political police, taboo subjects, manipulation o f public media, state lies, police brutality were
the daily lot o f a press proud o f i t s tradition o f independence. The new Government in 2005
created the National Advisory Commission on Press and Audiovisual Reform and sought TA
from RSF. It accepted RSF recommendation to end censorship and resume broadcasts in the
capital by Radio France Internationale (RFI). An ordinance o n the freedom o f the press was
adopted in xxx. As a result o f the transition authority’s measures, Mauritania’s ranking on the
press freedom index has improved dramatically from 138th in 2004 (out o f 168) to 77” in
2006 (Reporters without Borders). Similarly, i t s overall civil liberties status, and the status o f
i t s press freedom, has been upgraded from “not fee” in 2005 to “partly free” in 2006
(Freedom House).
CRED, UNDP, and the U.S. Embassy have hosted training seminars and support to the
independent press. The PRSP-2 calls for media to play a key role in information
dissemination, particularly in the rural areas. I t promises t o open up private radio and
television stations. The Government has also established the National Commission for Press
Reform to improve the environment in which the press operates.

Communications and Freedom of Information: Recognizing the role o f development
communications the Government i s in the process o f establishing a national strategy for
communication about public policy initiatives in a format which matches each target
stakeholder category. This proposal entails:
o Adopting a communications law which outlines government obligations, including
content, format and frequency regulations and building capacity for the ministry
tasked with these responsibilities.
o Institutionalizing the communications function within each department by
designating a spokesperson, furnishing a press room, holding regular press
conferences, and publishing information bulletins.
o Building capacity within both the public and private press in order t o foster a culture
o f responsible dialogue and constructive criticism, in keeping with the proper
functioning o f a democratic state.

Political Accountability
Political ComDetition: The transition authorities clearly stated that none o f the members o f
the current Government would stand for election. Candidates from 35 parties contested in the
recent legislative elections (held in November 2006). The Government’s encouragement o f
candidates to run as independents resulted in the fragmentation o f the vote, preventing any
single party to gain a majority o f seats. At least 20 candidates will present themselves for
presidential elections in March 2007.

Corruption26

As may be expected, the wealmesses in the governance system have allowed corruption to develop with
relatively little interference. At the same time, Mauritania’s ranking in cross-country perception-based
surveys suggests that corruption so far i s a moderate problem relative to the Sub-Saharan African average.
Mauritania ranked 84” out o f 163 in the Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index, and
within the 60” percentile on the WBI control o f corruption index (see “Governance at a Glance” below).
In-depth diagnostic surveys are not available to provide an empirical profile o f corruption; however,
ongoing analysis and the upcoming sectoral diagnostic o f corruption are expected to provide more
empirical data.

2.1

26

Drivers of corruption
The most likely drivers are the lack o f transparency, meritocracy and accountability o f public
officials; elite capture o f businesses, banks, and public administration; and l o w risk o f
sanctions/punishments attached to corrupt behavior. Bank staff analysis suggests that corruption in
Mauritania has deep social and political roots in the 20 year military oligarchy in which office
holders were rotated frequently to spread access to state largesse, with which they could reward
their own constituencies, to limit defection to the opposition. Due to the rigid structure o f these
groups, power i s concentrated in the hands o f a few people, who extend benefits only to their
relatives. Public sector employment and promotions are therefore part o f a system which does not

This summarizes existing analyses and will be further expanded with findings from the ongoing study on corruption jointly
conducted by the EU, UNDP, the PRECASP project and the World Bank country team.

- 119-

Annex C7 - Governance and Corruption in Mauritania

value free competition and professionalism. In addition, the concept o f public goods i s not wellanchored to the point that corruption i s at times condoned (as a legitimate way o f surviving) rather
than condemned. Furthermore, decisions are not taken in respect to rules and regulations, the access
to public information i s difficult, and governmental institutions remain little accountable to the
population as well as to the private sector and civil society organizations.

2.2

Administrative corruption
The recently completed Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) showed that informal payments
represented about 6.6 percent o f annual turnover; a third o f survey respondents report corruption as
a “severe/major” obstacle. These numbers are relatively moderate and may suggest that corruption
costs are being factored into business decisions. The Bank’s Doing Business Survey for 2007 ranks
Mauritania 148* (out o f 175) for the ease o f doing business and 164* for starting a business.
Enterprises carry a heavy tax burden representing 104 percent o f their profits, and trading across
borders i s extremely costly. Corruption and weak governance are reported to be significant
constraints to private sector growth. The I C A points out: (i)a deficient business environment
inadequate access to financial services; (iii)
a weak legal
compounded by governance issues; (ii)
framework and judicial system and difficulty in enforcing contracts; (iv) l o w quality and high cost
o f infrastructure services, particularly transport, energy and telecommunications; and (v) a weak
skills base.

2.3

Grand corruption
The current Government has alleged that certain amendments to o i l agreements with international
consortium members signed by former o i l minister Zeidane Ould Hmeida in February 2004 and
March 2005 were signed “outside the legal framework o f normal practice, to the great detriment o f
our country”. Mr. Hmeida was arrested and charged in January 2006 for “serious crimes against the
country’s essential economic interests” according to an official statement. The complaint has been
referred abroad for investigation. The new Government has declared its commitment to EITI
(Decree N o 2006-001) and U N C A C and both lMF and the Bank are heavily involved in providing
assistance for transparent and prudent o i l revenue management.

2.4

Potential risks o f worsening corruption
Experience in many other countries, especially natural resource-rich ones, exposes the risks
resulting from improper management o f public resources. Given the weak state o f Mauritania’s
financial management system, this risk i s not insignificant. Channeling part o f the revenue windfall
into poverty reducing programs will be key. In particular, a balance between rural and urban
incomes will be important as growing disparity between major cities and the rest o f the country
could lead to social tensions, which, in the past, have contributed to undemocratic changes o f
regimes.

2.5

Specific actions taken
The Government has enacted L a w 2005-048 criminalizing both money laundering and terrorist
financing (AMLKFT), and L a w 2005-047, criminalizing terrorism. It has ratified the UN
Convention against Corruption and i s signatory t o the African Union Convention o n Preventing and
Combating Corruption. The Government has called for a national debate to design a national anticorruption strategy. I t has requested donor assistance and invited a group o f key stakeholders to j o i n
the Technical Committee, created specifically for this task. Other planned actions include a
participatory diagnostic o f corruption in three areas (public expenditure management, petroleum
sector, and transport sector).

Annex C8 - Strategic Positioning o f Technical and Financial Partners: Descriptive Note o n Tools and
Processes

Strategic Positioning of Technical and Financial Partners
Descrivtive Note on Tools and Processes

1. Objectives o f the Approach
The government of Mauritania and its main financial partners are committed to increase aid
effectiveness. They have started implementing the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, and are
working on a joint action plan o n aid harmonization. O f the axes o f progress identified by the Paris
Declaration, division of labor among donors is a promising avenue to reduce aid transaction costs and
strengthen complementarity. The Paris Declaration envisages that the government would review the
comparative advantages o f i t s various financial partners and analyze h o w to achieve more
complementarity at the country level. T o be successful, such a challenging endeavor requires a mature
relationship between the government and the donors, and a shared will to overcome the various obstacles
to improve the status quo. A handful o f countries are piloting this promising innovation.
Beyond financing, Mauritania needs to coordinate donor assistance and transfer knowledge. As the
country’s financial constraints are expected to loosen over the coming years, capacity building, more than
mere transfer of resources, w i l l become a prominent dimension of external assistance. Thus, any attempt
to increase selectivity o f donor engagement to reduce coordination costs should pay special attention to
each donor’s core competencies to offer the government the most efficient and effective assistance.
Similarly, a coherent, strategic approach to position donors to best meet country needs i s o f special
interest to the Mauritanian government. In turn, donors will benefit from concentrating o n their
comparative advantages, better matching their assistance to country needs to maximize the impact o f their
assistance.

An analysis of strategic positioning will help better match country needs with donor assistance. A first
step in the dCmarche i s to map financing needs and commitments, but this by itself will not optimize
donors’ positioning. T o go beyond this mere financial view and better match demand and supply o f
development assistance, the proposed approach must complement the: (1) analysis o f the country’s
financing requirements with an assessment o f needs in every sector; and (2) analysis o f donors’ financing
with their proven proficiency and core competence in each sector. These analyses lend themselves to two
distinct and complementary approaches that answer the needs o f both the government and donors. On the
one hand, the analyses enable an analysis o f the portfolio o f a given donor across sectors; on the other
hand, they enable comparing donors’ comparative advantages in any sector.

2. Description of Tools

A. MultisectoraVmono-donor
This view i s intended mainly for donors. I t enables a given donor to show i t s positioning according to:

1. Need o f the sectors in which i t operates, with a grade o f 1 to 5;
2. I t s comparative advantage in the sector, with a grade o f 1 to 5;
3. I t s relative weight in the sector, in comparison with the total amount o f financing by all donors.

- 122 -

Annex C8 - Strategic Positioning o f Technical and Financial Partners: Descriptive Note o n Tools and
Processes

For a donor, the tool enables answering thefollowing questions:

..

In which sector must we reinforcehmprove our proficiency i f we want to be present?

From which sector can we withdraw if we lack resources?
Are we positioned in sectors that really have needs?

(i) Sector need
The selected criteria to compute the need of a sector and the corresponding assessment method are
presented below. Each o f these criteria, i f applicable, i s computed and then rated from 1 to 5 according to
the scoring grid below. The total rating average o f all criteria generates the overall need.
The relativefinancial gap i s expressed as percentage o f the financing need not yet covered for this sector.
The financing need as defined by the government i s taken from i t s Medium-Term Expenditure
Framework (MTEF) according to the sector needs formulated in PRSP-2. The financial gap i s therefore
calculated as:

Financial gap =1-

Government financing

+

Commitments of the donors in the sector

Total amount granted to the sec tor i n the CDMT

The computed value i s then translated into a grade o f 1 t o 5, according to following scoring grid:
1. No gap

2.14%
3.8-1 5%
4. 1 5 2 3 %
5. + 23%

The analytical gap describes the lack o f analytical data for the sector as evaluated by the government and
partners during the collaborative CAS workshops. The importance o f the gap has been color-coded and
then translated into the following scores:
1. Green
3. Orange

5. Red

The urgency of the sector to reach the MDGs measures the level o f ambition o f the development
objectives for which it i s critical for partners to increase efforts to attain the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs). This need i s evaluated by using the probability to reach certain objectives, as stated in the
annual report o f the UNDP on the level o f attained MDGs:
Need =1- probability of reaching the M D G s .

The weaker the probability o f reaching the MDGs, the more important i s the need considered to be. T h i s
indicator enables putting the financial gap in perspective. Although the financing need formulated for

- 123 -

Annex C8 - Strategic Positioning o f Technical and Financial Partners: Descriptive Note o n Tools and
Processes

certain sectors (as defined by the government in the MTEF) i s completely covered, it proved to be
insufficient to reach the MDGs. In the absence o f MDGs for certain sectors, it i s possible to find other
indicators (for example, as defined in PRSP-2 and other studies) to evaluate the probability o f achieving
MDG goals.
The number of donors present in the sector refers to the higher the number o f donors present, the lower
the sector’s need. In light o f coordination difficulties, a small number o f donors with significant
individual financing i s more desirable. The scoring grid below i s used t o register the number o f donors
active in a sector:
1. + 10
2.9-1 0
3. 7-8

4. 5-6
5. less than 4

(io Comparative advantage of a donor
The comparative advantage of a donor is assessed by its acknowledged proficiency in the sector. This
expertise constitutes itself by one or more o f the following criteria: (a) institutional competence;
(b) competence o f specific teams; (c) competence o f a responsible project person or individual focal
point; (d) reactivity o f donor; and (e) performance o f operations. The more traits a donor possesses, the
higher i t s expertise will be judged.
Regional experience/expertise needs to be taken into account. Despite i t s own expertise, country
circumstances often limit donor actions in a specific sector. To not unduly penalize the donor, i t s relevant
regional experience in a sector also i s taken into account. For example, knowing a donor cannot take
action in Mauritania in a sector but has successfully financed a large number o f projects in other African
countries can justify awarding this donor a high score for expertise. In this way, expertise in Mauritania i s
evaluated when possible and complemented with expertise in the Africa Region when available. O f
course, expertise in Mauritania i s weighted with a higher score.
Direrent evaluation frameworks and review cycles for donor performance are taken into account and
then translated into the common assessment scale. Building on individually available assessments,
reviews for this common analysis will take place in two phases. In the case o f the World Bank (figure
C9. l),
expertise was evaluated based on current and past project performance (portfolio scorecard for
active projects, I C R for closed projects). Other criteria considered were competence o f project teams and
reactivity o f the Bank. Inparallel, the Bank will solicit feedback on i t s expertise from the government and
other partners.
Additional criteria to measure expertise are taken into account, such as advisory capacity and
institutional support, or the average delay in project preparation. Another pertinent criterion would be the
donor’s coordination capacity, but this i s extremely delicate to evaluate.

does not think that it will be able to sufficiently increase i t s expertise, it might want to consider
leaving the sector to more competent partners.
Quadrant 2: The donor i s positioned in a sector that has high needs for assistance and in which the
donor has a strong comparative advantage. Focusing, and if needed, reinforcing i t s presence therefore
i s a logical choice.
Quadrant 3: The question arises as to whether i s makes sense for a donor to remain engaged in a
sector that has comparatively l o w need. T o satisfy this need, it i s sufficient that only
donors with strong comparative advantage stay engaged and that less competent donors withdraw or
consider participating in a multidonor program.

Quadrant 4: In face o f l o w need and l o w expertise, a donor i s very poorly positioned and should
consider withdrawing from the sector.

This tool enables the government and a given donor to compare comparative advantages across different
sectors and donors.
For donors, the tool answers thefollowing questions:

..

All questions previously listed, and
Should we enter a given sector?

For the government, the tool answers thefollowing questions:

..

Which donor i s best placed to lead assistance in a given sector?
I s assistance overcrowded in a given sector?
Does a given sector lack support?

Figure C9.2 contrasts the comparative advantages of several donors in the diferent sectors. Analysis i s
based o n the same criteria previously used to evaluate the sector need and donors’ respective comparative
advantage. The size o f the bubbles in figure C9.2 represents the absolute weight o f each donor in the
sector according to the amount o f financing it granted. Different sectors are looked at in parallel (social
and transverse sectors). Sector needs and financing gaps are shown on the Y axis, and each color
identifies a different donor.
