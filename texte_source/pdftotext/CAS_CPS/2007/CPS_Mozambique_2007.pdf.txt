EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
i.
Introduction. T h i s Country Partnership Strategy covers the period July 2007-June 201 1
(FY08-1 l),
and follows the 2003-2007 (FY04-07) Country Assistance Strategy (Report No.
26747-MOZ). I t s purpose i s to support the Government o f Mozambique (GoM) in implementing
i t s second Poverty Reduction Support Strategy, or PARPA I1 (the Portuguese acronym for
Second Action Plan for the Reduction o f Absolute Poverty). As the harmonization agenda has
made significant progress in Mozambique, development partners and Government have
collaborated to jointly analyze development needs and to coordinate the development o f country
assistance strategies. T h i s i s the first Country Partnership Strategy for the World Bank Group in
Mozambique. It i s the second assistance strategy developed jointly between IDA, IFC and MIGA
for their support to Mozambique.
ii. Development Context. Mozambique has been a strong economic performer over the past
decade. Between 1996 and 2006, following the devastating civil war that ended in 1992, the
economy grew at an average annual rate o f 8 percent. The poverty headcount index f e l l by 15
percentage points between 1996/7 and 2002/3. Economic expansion was made possible by
overall macroeconomic stability, sound policy reforms, growth in agriculture, post-war
reconstruction, mega-projects, and strong support from development partners. However, .part o f
this growth i s attributed to a post-conflict catch-up effect that cannot last indefinitely. Sustained
future growth i s expected to be driven by coordinated infkastructure development, natural
resource extractive industries, energy, agriculture, tourism, private sector development, and
increased regional trade.
iii. In addition to physical investments, many o f key sectors require second-generation
reforms in order to create the enabling environment to unleash a new round o f growth.
Governance reforms are a priority, and are especially important in public financial management,
decentralization and public sector management, as also i s legal and judicial reform, including
reform o f regulatory frameworks (e.g., in relation to land administration and markets, tax,
business licensing). These reforms need to be combined with institution and capacity-building,
especially at the local level, results monitoring, and increased citizen participation in the design
and oversight o f public interventions. Such reform will foster improvement in the investment
climate, and ensure that the poor also continue to benefit from growth.
iv.
Despite impressive growth, Mozambique remains one o f the poorest countries in the
world with high levels of absolute poverty and malnutrition, ranking 168 out of 177 countries in
the Human Development Index for 2004. While the country i s on track to achieving the
Millennium Development Goal (MDG) for poverty reduction, significant progress needs to be
made in increasing access to health care services, water and sanitation services, and quality
higher education, especially in rural areas, in order to attain the other MDGs.
v.
HIV/AIDS poses perhaps the single greatest threat to Mozambique’s continuing growth
and development. Governance issues pose another significant risk. Upcoming elections in 2007
(provincial assemblies), 2008 (municipal), and 2009 (national presidential and parliamentary)

may also affect difficult decisions needed for second generation reforms. Inadequate fiduciary
controls and a failure to strengthen public financial accountability mechanisms could result in
increased corruption, which would undermine government credibility and private-sector
confidence. Finally, Mozambique i s also vulnerable to exogenous shocks, including weatherrelated shocks, terms-of-trade shocks, and external private investment decisions that have a
significant macro-economic impact.
vi.
Bank Group Strategy. Within this context, t h e World Bank Group, in collaboration with
Government and development partners, has developed a strategy that: (i)incorporates lessons
from the previous CAS; (ii)leverages t h e Bank Group’s comparative advantages; and (iii)
exploits partnership opportunities; while (iv) prioritizing the country’s harmonization agenda and
supporting Government’s poverty reduction objectives. The strategy includes three pillars, within
which five major result areas encompass 18 development outcomes, as follows:

vii.
Delivering the Bank Group Program. Assuming progress under the performance
framework relative to other IDA beneficiaries - and an IDA15 replenishment broadly
comparable to IDA 14 - the annual financing available to Mozambique over FY08- 11 is expected
to be approximately $155 million. This i s similar to the $680 million over four years allocated
under the 2003-7 CAS. Given the results o f the Debt Sustainability Analysis, Mozambique i s
expected to receive financing in the form o f credits. If it maintains the current level o f
performance, PRSCs will comprise approximately 40 percent o f IDA’S commitments over the

CPS period. Should performance shift significantly in either direction, especially in the core
governance areas, t h i s amount will be adjusted in consultation with Government and G18
partners. SWAPSand common fund arrangements will be used to minimize transactions costs for
all development partners.
viii. Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA) will be a major instrument o f support. In some
sectors or themes, AAA will form the sole source o f support from the Bank Group, as financing
from other development partners i s leveraged. AAA will be organized around the main pillars o f
the strategy, and will address knowledge gaps or deepen understanding in particular areas;
facilitate policy dialogue; and provide greater support for government programs, as requested.

ix.
The risks discussed above have been taken into account in the engagement framework.
Risks o f exogenous shoFks are generally beyond the direct control o f Government, and their
actual occurrence should in principle justify greater commitments o f resources from the Bank
Group in the form o f financing and advice. Risks o f HIV/AIDS, governance deterioration, and
policy reversals are within Government’s grasp, and would justify a more nuanced response.
x.
As a relatively small country with correspondingly small market power and resources,
Mozambique’s longer-term growth strategy needs to be built on i t s comparative and strategic
advantages and complementarities within southern Africa. Collaboration with neighboring
countries and even the wider international community i s also necessary to address public goods
and trans-boundary issues such as water resources management, energy, transport, trade,
migration, and, above all, HIV/AIDS. During the next four years, the World Bank Group will
support Government’s efforts to take advantage o f regional integration and growth opportunities,
especially relative to the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC).

xi.
The development context i s also changing for the World Bank Group in Mozambique.
Supporting the Paris Declaration with its focus on collaboration among development partners,
and the entry o f new partners such as the Government o f China, the Millennium Challenge
Corporation and the Gates Foundation, present new opportunities for partnership. In addition, the
maturing needs o f development in Mozambique will offer opportunities to the widest suite of
Bank Group products - for national and regional IDA resources, IFC, MIGA, IBRD partial risk
guarantees, carbon financing and various trust funds, including the Global Environmental
Facility, and so on. The World Bank Group will consider creative business, operational and
organizational models that will leverage i t s comparative advantages in this new environment and
which will best achieve it and GoM’s overarching goal o f poverty reduction.
Suggested Topics for Board Discussion. Board members may wish to discuss the
xii.
following aspects o f this partnership strategy:

.

(a)

Does the draft CPS adequately address the key development challenges that
Mozambique faces, especially given the Bank Group’s comparative advantages?

(b)

I s the proposed program appropriate for a well-performing but poor country
operating in a changing environment with emerging new development partners (e.g.
Government o f China, Gates Foundation) and meaningfil governance challenges?

(c)

Are the economic and political risks adequately assessed?

Introduction

.

1.
T h i s Country Partnership Strategy covers the period July 2007-June 201 1 (FY08-1 l),
and follows the 2003-2007 (FY04-07) Country Assistance Strategy (Report No. 26747-MOZ)
which was discussed at the Board on October 20, 2003 - and the completion report for which is
at Appendix 6. Its purpose is to support the Government o f Mozambique (GoM) in implementing
its second Poverty Reduction Support Strategy, or PARPA I1 (the Portuguese acronym for
Second Action Plan for the Reduction o f Absolute Poverty). PARPA 11, approved by Cabinet in
September 2006, covers 2006-2009 and continues many o f the objectives laid out in the first
PARPA (200 1-2005) but with the next stage o f results largely expected through investments in
rural areas and second-stage reforms. PARPA I1 also adds focus on key cross-cutting objectives
that require coordination across key sectors. This Country Partnership Strategy i s timed to be in
sequence with the development o f Government’s strategy, and to facilitate coordination and
alignment among development partners’ country assistance strategies.
2.
The World Bank Group has been working with Governrpent and development partners to
harmonize development assistance with the ultimate goal o f helping Mozambique achieve its
poverty reduction goals efficiently and effectively. Since the start o f the last CAS, the
harmonization agenda has made significant progress in Mozambique. In 2004, development
partners signed a Memorandum o f Understanding to: (i)
provide harmonized, predictable and
effective general budget sup ort through a joint monitoring framework, the Performance
implement the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.
Assessment Framework (PAF) ; and, (ii)
In 2006-7, development partners and Government worked together to jointly analyze
development needs and to coordinate the development o f country assistance strategies. This joint
analysis and review has resulted in the development o f the first Country Partnership Strategy for
the World Bank Group in Mozambique.

P

3.
The fourteen or so development partners who were to prepare support strategies in 20067 undertook from late 2005 five common joint analyses on subjects ranging from evaluation o f
progress under PARPA I to significant political economy considerations in Mozambican
development. These analyses were shared among all partners for use in their strategy
preparations. Government then launched in mid 2006 a formal peer review process (with donor
and consultant input) o f each proposed draft strategy - through document review and live
discussion with each partner; their written, detailed conclusions on each proposed strategy being
shared among all donors. While there were discussions among partners about doing some joint
strategies, in the end donors felt that provided they each supported PARPA I1 and took into
account the peer review recommendations, especially on areas o f donor concentration and
collaboration, this was as significant harmonization as could be expected o f joint strategies - and
was achievable with considerably less bureaucracy, time and effort. As a result, no joint
strategies were prepared.

The Performance Assessment Framework is the subset of PARPA I1 indicators that the G18 development partners
track on an annual basis as the monitoringfiamework for general budget support. The G18 partners are: Afiican
Development Bank, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, EU, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands,
Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, and the World Bank (IDA).

4.
This strategy i s the second country assistance strategy developed jointly within the World
Bank Group between IDA, IFC, and MIGA, continuing the practice that started during the
development o f the FY04-07 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). It i s the fifth in a series o f
strategic frameworks that, over the past twelve, years, have contributed to a constructive
partnership with the GoM.

5.
Mozambique has achieved impressive economic growth since the conclusion o f almost
three decades o f pre- and post-independence conflict in 1992 and the first democratic election in
1994. T h e poverty headcount index f e l l by 15 percentage points between 199617 and 2002/3. The
8 percent average GDP growth rate between 1996 and 2006, the highest in Africa over that
period for a non oil-producing country, is attributed to consistent sound macroeconomic
management and policy reforms, growth in agriculture, post-war reconstruction, implementation
o f mega-projects, and strong support from development partners. However, part o f t h i s growth i s
attributed to a post-conflict catching-up effect that cannot last indefinitely. Thus, the challenge
over the next four years i s to sustain this growth while accelerating progress in key service
delivery sectors to improve Mozambique’s low Human Development indicators and to attain the
MDGs. In addition, HIV/AIDS and governance pose formidable challenges and are the key risks
to the country’s continuing development. Finally, as a relatively small country with limited
market power and resources, Mozambique’s longer-term growth strategy needs to be built on its
comparative and strategic advantages and complementarities within southern Africa.
In supporting government implement its strategy, the World Bank Group will also face
6.
challenges o f its own as development partners continue to advance the harmonization agenda,
and as the entry o f new partners such as the Government o f China, the Millennium Challenge
Corporation and the Gates Foundation, present new opportunities for partnership.

I.THE CHALLENGE: MORE BROAD-BASED GROWTH
Overview

7.

Mozambique has been a strong economic performer over the past decade. Economic
expansion was made possible by overall macroeconomic stability, policy reform, growth in
agriculture, post-war reconstruction, mega-proj ects, and strong support from development
partners.

8.
T h i s pattern o f development has been accompanied by a steady pace o f change in the
governance structures o f the country. However, the expectation and practice o f participation and
accountability are s t i l l young, and institution building i s in the early stages. Under the
circumstances, Mozambique’s performance as a country in recovery and transition i s
exceptional. However, despite increasingly specific government attention, the challenges o f
limited public and private sector capacity and corruption remain serious. Together, these
concerns need to be continually addressed to ensure that they do not put at risk the country’s
broader growth and poverty reduction goals.

9.
Recent Political Developments. Mozambique’s parliamentary elections o f 2004
reaffirmed Frelimo’s hold on power which it originally secured during the first elections in 1994.
These elections were judged by international monitors to be free and fair. Mozambique’s track
record o f political stability has allowed the elections to focus largely on socio-economic and
governance issues - by no means a small achievement. Moreover, democracy and
decentralization have encouraged a diversity o f political representation to emerge.

10.
At the same time, however, many analysts have expressed concern that an imbalance in
the political system can undermine the effectiveness o f political and institutional checks and
balances. As the dominant party, Frelimo’s influence i s significant in all three branches o f
Government. Moreover, the Parliamentary passage o f laws has been slow, and th&e are
complaints that the judiciary i s not independent. Social accountability i s not common as citizens,
civil society organizations and the media have weak capacity and limited participation and
oversight o f government activities and institutions. Many observers point to increasing public
dissatisfaction with the predictability o f politics in an environment o f patronage and clientelism;
the historically low participation (40 percent) in the 2004 parliamentary election was taken by
some as an indication o f disillusionment among voters at the absence o f significant party
optiom2
11.
During the next three years, three sets o f elections will impact the political landscape in
Mozambique. In 2007, there will be elections o f provincial assembly members, implementing a
requirement o f the revised 2004 constitution. In 2008, the third round o f municipal elections will
OCCUT, and in 2009, the fourth round o f presidential and parliamentary elections will take place.
Poverty and Public Service Delivery

12.
Poverty Trends. Income poverty, measured by the headcount ratio, has fallen steadily
from 69 percent o f the population in 1996/7 to 54 percent in 2002/3. The poverty gap (which
takes into account the distance separating the poor from the poverty line) has also decreased
s~bstantially.~
Mozambique i s on track to meet the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) for
poverty reduction (see Appendix 8a, 8b). Despite this performance, Mozambique remains one o f
the poorest countries in the world with high levels o f absolute poverty and maln~trition,.~
Per
capita income was US$340 in 2006, compared with the Sub-Saharan Africa average o f US$500.
Moreover, income inequality has increased slightly since 1997.5
13.
Recent poverty reduction trends point to greater progress in rural areas relative to urban
areas. However, absolute poverty in 2002/3 was still more prevalent in rural areas (55 percent),
where the majority o f the population live and work, than in urban areas (5 1 percent). The poverty
headcount also differs significantly across regions, ranging from 45 percent in the center o f the

ercent in 1994 to 40 percent in recent elections.

The HDI i s a composite measure o f three elements o f human development: l i f e expectancy, adult literacy and
income (measured by purchasing power parity).

country, where the greatest reduction took place over the period, to 66 percent in the south; and
across provinces, ranging from 36 percent in Sofala (in the center) to 81 percent in Inhambane
(in the south). In general, these differences partially reflect provinces’ relative access to markets
and opportunities for economic diversification.

14.
Access to Public Services. Public services are more accessible in urban areas than in rural
areas, further compounding the already difficult realities o f poverty among the rural poor and
limiting their opportunity for economic advancement. Sub-regional disparities in enrollment and
completion rates for both primary and secondary education are significant: enrollment and
completion rates are much higher in Maputo, the capital city, than in the more rural northern and
central provinces. Supply, quality and access to basic health services are also more limited in
rural locations. Finally, while the MDG for urban water provision should be achieved, it i s
unlikely that this will be the case for rural water provision.
15.
Education. Access to primary education increased from 2 million in 2001 to almost 4
million in 2006, the period o f PARPA I. Nonetheless, significant challenges remain. For
example, the primary completion rate i s s t i l l below 50 percent. Girls’ enrollment, especially at
the post-primary levels, lags significantly behind that o f boys. Mozambique i s thus at risk o f not
being able to achieve the MDG for universal primary education and gender equity in education.
Progress in improving access to post-primary education has also been slow. Only 500,000
students are enrolled in secondary education progrhs, and 30,000 in tertiary programs.
Significant disparities remain between rural and urban locations, and are exacerbated by the
demand for secondary, technical, and tertiary education which i s higher in wealthier urban areas,
making it ever more difficult for government education policies to be effectively pro-poor.

16.
The quality and relevance o f education continues to be a concern. O f the seven million
people active in the labor market, more than 90 percent have completed only five years o f
primary education or less. There i s a significant shortage o f technical and higher level skills,
especially in math and science. O f the 30,000 students enrolled in the sixteen higher education
institutions, less than one-third major in natural sciences, agriculture, engineering and health
sciences, and fewer eventually graduate. Nationwide, less than 300 people have Ph.D. degrees.
17.
In addition to the challenges o f coverage and quality, corruption in the education sector
diminishes the efficiency and quality o f service delivery, especially to the poor. Diversion o f
funds ensures that less money than intended reaches schools and beneficiaries. Corruption also
occurs at the level o f individual teachers, with children and their parents subjected to varying
illegal practices including: unauthorized charges levied on school admission forms; bribes to
obtain good grades or exam scores, or to buy exam questions; forced payment for private
tutoring in order to get quality instruction; and sexual coercion o f students. These abuses
particularly affect poor children as their parents are less likely to have the means, knowledge and
access to counter them. Finally, the education sector is impacted by the general civil service
“ghost worker” problem.6

Health. Even though there has been consistent improvement in some indicators in recent
years, Mozambique’s health and human development indicators rank among the lowest in the
world. Maternal mortality fell from more than 1,000 per 100,000 live births in the early 1990s to
408 in 2003, compared to the 2000 average o f 910 Sub-Saharan Africa.’ Under-5 mortality
decreased from 219 per 1,000 live births in 1993 to 152 in 2004, compared to the Sub-Saharan
average o f 171 per 1,000 births in 2004.* However, under-5 mortality and maternal mortality are
higher in the more rural northern and central provinces, where the lack o f health care facilities
limits access to care. Remote rural areas are also more affected by the human resource bottleneck
faced by the health system: there are not enough health care workers. The increase in
government spending on hospitals in urban centers (partly driven b y the rise in noncommunicable and chronic diseases, and the related increased cost o f care and treatment)
exacerbates the disparities in public provision between urban residents and t h e rural poor. As
with the rest o f Sub-Saharan Africa, HIV/AIDS and malaria are the leading causes of death in
Mozambique. Life expectancy i s declining due to HIV/AIDS and i s now slightly below 40 earsg
(compared to 44 years in 1999), which is lower than the Sub-Saharan average o f 47 years.

HIV/AIDS poses one o f the most serious socio-economic problems today for the country.
Mozambique has the seventh highest prevalence rate in the world; 16 percent o f the population i s
currently living with HIV/AIDS. In 2005, there were 123,000 AIDS-related deaths and 400,000
children were orphaned when their parents died from AIDS. Mozambique i s surrounded by
countries that have some o f the highest prevalence rates in the world (South Africa, Swaziland,
Botswana, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Tanzania). The epidemic has devastating effects on
Mozambique’s economic growth. Studies estimate that HIV/AIDS reduces African countries’
economic growth by 1 to 2 percentage points per year. The Food and Agricultural Organization
(FAO) estimates that Mozambique may lose more than 20 percent o f its agricultural labor force
by 2020 because o f the disease. Institutions are also losing their professional work force at an
alarming rate. If the epidemic is not curbed, social networks could collapse as the most
productive age groups will be decimated and future generations will grow up without the nurture
o f a family. Palliative care for patients will also drain scarce public resources. Government has
prioritized dealing with the HIV/AIDS problem and the national response continues to
accelerate, but i s s t i l l not commensurate with the need. The World Bank Group and development
partners continue to work closely with Government to address this urgent issue (see Box 1).
20.
As in the education sector, corruption in health service delivery reduces the quality and
quantity o f services that reach the poor. Fraudulent practices include: the stealing o f drugs and
supplies; using public facilities for private gain; requests for unofficial payments for services that
are supposed to be provided at no cost; charging bribes to provide regular services or to speed up
the provision o f services; using access to patients in public hospitals and clinics to transfer them
to private clinics, and; manipulating the drug registration and procurement process. Weaknesses
in procurement and financial management at the ministry level provide another avenue for
leakage o f funds in the service delivery process.l1

Box 1. The Bank Group and H I V / A I D S in Mozambique
HIV/AIDS i s a pervasive issue in Mozambique, includingfor the World Bank Group. The Bank Group’s response to
the epidemic includes interventions aligned with other development partners to influence government policy and
Mozambican public behavior, to deal with the epidemic in all Bank Group operations, and to address the issue for
Bank Group staff. The Bank Group and other partners have played a significant role in bringing the attention o f
Government and political leaders to publicly address the epidemic. T h e Bank Group also discusses HIVIAIDS
frequently in i t s external relations and public speaking engagements. An HIV/AIDS specialist has been employed in
the Bank’s Mozambique Country Office since 2004 to support our program in general and, more recently, to help
mainstream HIV/AIDS interventions into all Bank Group operations across the AFCS2 countries (Mozambique,
Angola, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe). IFC has a program to help private businesses address HIV/AIDS. The
Mozambique Bank Country Office has an internal HIV/AIDS confidential counseling and treatment program for
staff, the counselor being a person living with the disease who benefited fiom a HIV/AIDS treatment program
supported by IDA and other partners. In addition, the second HIV/AIDS project that IDA supports, the MAP
HIV/AIDS Project, i s instituting a grant management mechanism to support public institutions in implementing
HIV/AIDS programs. Over the next four years, the World Bank Group will support a MAP HIV/AIDS SWAP that
aims to strengthen the implementation capacity o f the National AIDS Commission, extend the Treatment
Acceleration Program (TAP), and help develop a regional project with southern Afiica neighbors to deal with
transborder HIV/AIDS issues

2 1.
Water supply and sanitation. Although poor data quality and disputes over measurement
issues make reporting on access to water indicators a challenge, current data and development
partner estimates indicate that the MDG for access to water in urban areas has a chance o f being
met although it i s unlikely that the MDG for access to water in rural areas will be met unless
investment is increased substantially (see Appendix 8a, 8b). Access to water in urban areas,
currently estimated at 37 percent, l2 has significantly improved through two consecutive national
water rojects (where IDA i s the lead partner) which have increased access to water in five major
cities, strengthened sector institutions and the regulatory framework, and successfully piloted
the delegated management model which contracts out management to private sector operators
with oversight by a regulatory body. The urban water strategy not only provides for increased
coverage, it also aims to secure full cost recovery for larger cities so that in future investment
needs can tap market funds, which will enable sector budget allocations to be directed primarily
to rural and small towns where cost recovery i s limited. IDA is preparing an operation in FY07
(Water Services and Institutional Support Project) which leverages funds from the Millennium
Development Corporation and the Africa Catalytic Growth Fund to scale up this model.

22.
Access to safe water in rural areas i s currently estimated at 41 percent. However, the rate
o f delivery by Government o f new and rehabilitated rural water supply infiastructure has not
increased measurably over the last four years, partly due to implementation problems associated
with decentralization o f service provision to districts and municipalities. With the central
ministry not yet decentralized, a key issue has been the aligning o f the national strategy with the
processes o f decentralized service delivery institutions. A G o M rural water supply and sanitation
strategic plan has recently been approved. I t secured a consensus among Government,
development partners and local governments on the appropriate role o f local government in
service provision and maintenance, although implementation o f this approach (which will be

supported through a multi-partner SWAP) i s expected to take several years. IDA will support the
development o f the SWAP through the FY07 Water Services and Institutional Support Project.
23.
The incidence o f water borne diseases such as cholera and diarrhea indicates that
improving urban sanitation i s an important objective in Mozambique. Though G o M has clearly
given water supply (and education and health) a higher priority than sanitation, a Strategic
Sanitation Plan (SSP) was completed in 2004 with funding from IDA’s first National Water
Development Project. The SSP covers Maputo, Matola, Beira, Dondo, Nampula, Pemba and
Quelimane, and provides complementary sanitation developments over a 15-year planning
horizon. I t encompasses storm water drainage, and wastewater and solid waste management, and
considers infrastructural, institutional, financial and economic aspects. Some initiatives to
implement the SSP have been taken. For example, the EU i s implementing a US$27 million
sanitation project in Beira, and i s making sanitation investments in Maputo. The M C C i s
planning significant Sanitation investments in Quelimane, Pemba, Nampula and seven other
larger municipalities. Nonetheless, there remains a considerable sanitation challenge in the
country, especially in paying for the recurrent costs o f services. The FY07 Water Services and
Institutional Support Project will allow IDA to continue i t s engagement with the water sector in
Mozambique where opportunities can be explored for contributing IDA’s extensive country and
sector experience to ongoing and future initiatives to effectively address sanitation issues.
24.
In general there i s less concern about corruption in service delivery in the water sector as
compared to the health and education sectors. The majority o f water provision in major cities i s
provided by regulated utilities using private sector operators whose accounts are audited
regularly. Nonetheless, poor planning and financial management, including the accumulation o f
public debt in the sector, have adverse impacts on water systems development and delivery.
Because the Ministry o f Finance has not made available counterpart funds and processed VAT
refunds in a timely manner to the implementing contractors, the latter have increased their prices
for goods and services, thus increasing the cost o f service provision for all. Also, public
institutions have not been paying their water bills on time, if at all, which in turn increases tariffs
for private users, including the poor. Consequently, reform priorities for the water sector,
especially for the rural water sub-sector, include the implementation o f a performance
monitoring system and better linkages between plans, budget execution, and outputs.

A Sound Macroeconomic Framework
25.
Mozambique has pursued sound fiscal and monetary policies for much of the past decade.
Inflation was brought to single digits in the 1990s, but then peaked again at 17 percent in 2002 as
a result o f devastating floods in 2000 and 2001 and a banking crisis. Since then, inflation has
been kept under control through conservative fiscal and monetary policies (see Table 2). The
dollar exchange rate has remained broadly stable since 2002, except for a period o f appreciation
in the second half o f 2004 and early 2005, followed by several months o f exchange rate
fluctuations (mainly as a result o f the issues with exchange rate management and a rapid rise o f
o i l prices in the international markets). Since 2006, the exchange rate - which is a managed float
- has remained fairly stable, responding to supply and demand changes within a narrow band.

The primary fiscal deficit after grants f e l l from 3.5 percent o f GDP in 2004 to 1.9 percent
in 2005, and it i s estimated to have remained at the same level in 2006. The primary deficit i s
projected to increase to 2.9 percent in 2007 and then decline to 2.5 percent by 2009. This primary
deficit has been financed by concessional borrowing, including from IDA. This fiscal policy has
created space for the expansion o f credit to the economy, which grew at 22.5 percent in 2005, i s
estimated to have grown by 14.3 percent in 2006, and i s projected to continue to increase in real
terms by at least 17 percent each year during 2007-09.
27.
The macroeconomic program has been supported by an International Monetary Fund
(IMF) Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) and Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF) program. The fifth review was successfully completed in December, 2006. G o M
has requested that the PRGF be followed by a PSI (Policy Support Instrument). The sixth review
o f the PRGF and PSI preparation i s expected to be concluded by June, 2007 (see Box 2).
28.
Mozambique's debt i s sustainable as confirmed by a debt sustainability analysis carried
out by IDA and the IMF in 2006, taking the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) into
account. As a result o f the MDRI, the N e t Present Value o f public external debt i s estimated to
have been approximately halved, from about 25 percent to about 12 percent o f GDP in 2006. The
debt sustainability analysis shows that debt dynamics remain sustainable under the baseline and
stress tests, albeit susceptible to a ratcheting up o f non-concessional external borrowing. In this
respect, the authorities are appropriately committed to seeking non-recourse financing for the
transfer o f majority ownership o f the Cahora Bassa dam operating company, Hidroelktrica de
Cahora Bassa (HCB), so as not to increase government liabilities to commercial creditors. Final

-8-

agreements have yet to be signed with two Paris Club creditors (Japan and Portugal), as well as
with some large non-Paris Club bilateral creditors (e.g., Algeria, Romania, Libya, and Iraq) in
the context o f the enhanced HIPC Initiative. A second commercial debt buy-back operation was
approved by the Board in April, 2007; it will eliminate all eligible commercial debt under IDA’S
Debt Reduction Facility.
Box 2. Relations with the IMF
The relationship between the GoM and the IMF has been anchored by Article I V consultations and ESAF and PRGF
program negotiations. Mozambique has had four IMF-supported programs since 1987. The fifth review o f the most
recent PRGF arrangement was successfully completed in December, 2006. GoM has requested that the PRGF be
followed by a Policy Support Instrument (PSI). The sixth review o f the PRGF and the preparation of the PSI is
expected to be concluded by June, 2007. The relationship has been consistently constructive, as demonstrated by
Mozambique’s strong macroeconomic performance since 1987, early accession to full debt relief under the HIPC
Initiative in 1999, and the relatively low level o f waivers requested for ESAF/PRGF program reviews. The IMF has
been providing about 1000 staff hours o f technical assistance per year to respond flexibly to Government for macrofinancial advice.
The outlook for the IMF/GOM relationship remains favorable, as the GoM has engaged the IMF in a dialogue that
extends beyond the current PRGF arrangement’s closing in mid 2007. Development partners are also involved in
specific policy discussions, since all stakeholders agree that many macroeconomic policy outcomes have structural
foundations that development partners can usefklly support. Even though the IMF i s not a member o f the G18
General Budget Support donors group, the timing o f its missions i s such as to be synchronized with the Joint and
Mid-Year Review process o f the G18.
IDA and the I M F have worked closely together, including on the PRSCs and PRGF, advice on the financing
package o f Mozambiques’s purchase o f the Cahora Bassa Hydro-power system, and on the reform o f the fiscal code
governing mineral resources. The practice o f holding joint IMF-IDA missions has both had synergistic benefits, and
has reduced the burden on Government o f multiple missions.

29.
Pr,ospects for 2007-10 remain favorable, including for strong growth and the maintenance
o f a sustainable external position, as Government i s committed to take the necessary fiscal
measures and pursue a monetary program consistent with a further reduction o f inflation. End-of
period inflation was 13.2 percent as o f end-December 2006, but i s expected to continue to
decrease to an average 5.9 percent in 2007. With slower expansion in credit and some leveling
o f f in oil prices, inflation is expected to remain in single digits through 2009. Central to this
strategy will be a gradual strengthening o f the fiscal position underpinned by an average increase
in revenue o f 0.5 percent o f GDP per annum. Factors that have contributed to a positive
macroeconomic outlook include conservative fiscal policies, efforts to increase revenue
mobilization, no external borrowing on commercial terms, minimal subsidies to productive
sectors, and targeting two-thirds o f public expenditures to priority sectors for poverty reduction.

30.
Mozambique i s highly dependent upon official development assistance, with about half
o f government expenditure derived from external aid. Among development partners, IDA i s the
largest single financier, accounting for about twenty percent o f all development partner
contributions. The 18 development partners (“G18”) who provide general budget support
contribute about 80 percent o f Government’s external financing needs. Such dependency o n
external aid presents a risk in that Government may be more accountable to development
partners than to i t s own citizens. However, the Memorandum o f Understanding signed by the
G18 contains the principle that Government’s performance will be assessed based on the same
reports that it submits to Parliament - this elimination o f a parallel reporting system for external
-9-

partners i s an essential step to strengthen domestic accountability. Furthermore, Government’s
development strategy includes a plan to modernize the tax system and broaden the tax base
without raising tax rates. Revenues are programmed to increase by half a percentage point o f
GDP per year in the coming years, an objective met in 2005 and 2006. As GDP grows faster than
aid, Mozambique will reduce aid dependency and domestic accountability will be strengthened.

Growth through the New Economy

3 1.
Sources of Growth. Strong economic growth has contributed significantly to the decline
in economic poverty. Growth has averaged about 8 percent annually since 1996, a dramatic
improvement over the performance o f the previous decade, when real GDP growth averaged 4
per~ent.’~
This growth has been sustained by continuing agricultural growth, post-war
infrastructure rehabilitation, construction o f mega-projects and associated growth in natural
resource sectors, growth in manufacturing, and investment in public service provision, The
sectors which have grown most rapidly between 1996 and 2005 (as reflected by the percentage
point increase in their share o f GDP over the 10 year period), include: transport and
communications (5.2 percent), manufacturing (3.8 percent), construction (3.5 percent), public
service provision (3.1 percent), mining (0.9 percent), and restaurants and hotels (0.5 percent).
These sectors are likely to see a continued relative increase.
32.
B y contrast, the two most important traditional activities - agriculture (including
fisheries) and commerce grew less than average GDP growth. Although agriculture grew b y an
average 6.6 percent between 1996 and 2005, i t s share o f GDP declined by nearly 12 percentage
points (to 18.7 percent) while commerce’s share declined by two percentage points (to 21.8
percent) over the same period. Nonetheless, these two sectors remain the largest, and the largest
employers, accounting together for almost 40 percent o f GDP. Agriculture’s importance to the
livelihoods o f the majority o f the population requires a proactive stance in mitigating volatility,
providing supporting infrastructure, and disseminating productive technologies.

--

33.
The IMF and IDA estimate that future growth will be at least 7 percent per annum
through 2009 under the assumption that the reform agenda continues to be implemented, that
donor support stays broadly at the current level, and that no major natural disaster happens. Any
scaling-up o f aid or increased private investments should lead to higher growth rates. As outlined
in PARPA 11, a package o f governance reforms, improvements in the business environment,
investments in physical infrastructure, and the strengthening o f human and institutional capacity
i s necessary to achieve the objective o f high, sustained growth and poverty reduction.

34.
Drivers o f growth will continue to be in infrastructure development, mining, energy and
manufacturing mega-projects, agriculture, and increasingly tourism. Except for the megaprojects, these activities will facilitate rural development, a central theme o f PARPA 11.
Moreover, to ensure that the growth is broad-based, promotion o f small and medium enterprises
(SMEs) in needed. Finally, Mozambique will need to collaborate with neighboring countries to
leverage economies o f scale for markets, to enhance trade and risk management, and to find

HIV/AIDS, energy, and water resources management.

35.
Critical Growth Sectors: Needs Assessments and Proposed PARPA 11 Interventions.
Mozambique’s continued rapid development depends on further large and efficient investments
in infrastructure, including an increased energy supply available for the domestic market and
improved access to it, roads and transport, water resource management, agriculture, and
telecommunications. A particular challenge w i l l be the strengthening o f smallholder agriculture,
agribusinesses and SMEs that will have to occur for growth to be shared; otherwise, growth
generated by the mega-projects will benefit only a small part o f the population.
36.
Energy. Currently, only 7 percent o f Mozambican households have sustainable access to
electricity. Government’s goal i s to increase access to 10 percent by 2009. Many institutions in
rural areas, such as schools and clinics, do not have sustainable and affordable access to energy.
PARPA I1includes a target o f connecting 500 new institutions to an energy source by 2009. IDA
and the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) are already involved in the roll-out o f renewable
energy systems for remote schools and clinics. It i s anticipated that continued support in this area
will leverage additional resources, as well as policy and institutional developments to support a
scaling up o f this approach. Potential shortages o f energy supply to industry may hamper
Mozambique’s growth. Growth in domestic demand for electricity, exclusive o f any significant
new industrial loads, will increase at about 6-7 percent annually over the next decade. Currently
a number o f new industrial projects are in the advanced stages o f preparation, including the
Moatize coal mine, Chibuto Ititanium and zirconimum mine, and Mozal I11 aluminum smelter
projects, but power supply i s a potential constraint to their development. To meet the growth in
domestic demand and planned new industrial demand, Government i s planning significant new
generation and transmission infrastructure with considerable private sector participation.
Government has already begun the process o f selecting private sector strategic investors for three
new generation projects which require investments o f around US$ 4 billion.” It i s planned that
these generation projects will be complemented by a new 1500 km transmission line from Tete
to Maputo and beyond, which will become the “backbone” o f the national transmission grid.
From a regional perspective, there are also opportunities for m e r transmission
interconnections, including between Malawi and north-west Mozambique and with Tanzania. It
i s anticipated that the WBG will support Government in realizing these projects, possibly
through advisory services as well as financing instruments, including guarantees.

37.

Roads and Transport. Inadequate rural access to the road network and high transport
costs hinder both social development and production. Limited roads means that access to
education, health and other government services i s more difficult for rural populations - and they
are more difficult to staff, anyway, as staff generally prefer to be in less isolated locations. They
also mean that commercial activities are limited: traders and financial services suffer. And, poor
road access seriously hinders agricultural growth and productivity, limiting access to markets
and storage facilities for Mozambique’s farmers.

Road density per land area in Mozambique i s l o w at 0.05 kilometers o f road per square
kilometer. The present road network provides potential access16 to around 41 percent o f t h e rural
population; due to the poor condition o f the network, especially in the wet season, the percentage
o f the rural population that has reliable all year access is much smaller. Consequently, one o f the
main objectives o f the national 2007-2011 Road Sector Strategy and PARPA I1 i s to increase the
number o f the rural population with access to an all-season road. Another part o f the strategy is
to improve connectivity for rural producers and communities, which involves increasing access
to ports and railroads and decreasing costs o f transport. The concessioning o f major port and
railway systems to private o erators for rehabilitation has met with mixed results. The major port
concessions are ~perational!~However, the concessioning o f railways has met with less success
due to non-performance o f concessionaires, insufficient monitoring and enforcement o f
concession stipulations by Government; only the Machipanda line (Dandomeira to
Zimbabwehlutare) o f the Beira railway i s presently operating satisfactorily. Government i s also
starting to focus on the rehabilitation o f ferry traffic.
39.
Although air transport has an important role for some activities with high growth and
export revenue earnings potential (e.g., business travel, tourism, and high value exports),
privatization plans have been put on hold. The planned concession agreement for the Maputo
International Airport was drafted but Government decided to cancel the concession and rather
study options for financing and private participation. Government also put o n hold the
privatization o f LAM, the national airline, in part due to the company’s indebtedness. The
Communications Sector Reform Project (Cr. 35770) supports the development o f air safety
regulation and civil aviation law, and capacity development o f the Civil Aviation Institute. M a i n
challenges include: financing o f airport infrastructure, particularly in the provinces, and
identifying an appropriate medium-term strategy for LAM. As the first Communications Sector
Reform Project comes to a close, the Bank Group team (IDA and IFC) will support Government
with policy advice to find strategic investors for airports and the national airline. However, IDA
does not expect to provide financing for air transport during the period o f the CPS.

Agriculture. The agricultural sector i s central to Government’s growth strategy. However,
40.
challenges are great: overall agricultural productivity i s very low, many rural people live at nearsubsistence levels, there i s very little water harvesting (in a country alternatively struck by drought
and flood), even where existing, irrigation systems are seriously underutilized, and access to rural
financing i s negligible. Enhancing agricultural productivity, developing efficient irrigation,
improving access to finance and markets, strengthening and expanding value chains, promoting
agro-processing for exports, and encouraging private sector participation are major objectives o f
the agricultural growth strategy. In order to support this strategy, PARPA I1contains targets for: (i)
increasing access to technologies, extension information, and selected agricultural inputs; (ii)
promoting the construction and rehabilitation o f agrarian infrastructure, especially irrigation
schemes; (iii)
improving access to information and input/output markets; (iv) promoting the private
sector, especially in export markets for cashew, cotton, and sugar; and, (v) improving community
access to natural resources in a equitable manner for sustainable use and management. There is a
pressing need to use irrigation resources effectively and to expand and develop agribusinesses and
exports. Recent work on biofbels could open up significant new markets for the agriculture sector.

Wafer Resource Munugemenf. Water resources are a major natural asset for
Mozambique, and are instrumental to all economic sectors, including agriculture, energy,
industry and commerce, rural development and health. The combination o f high climatic and
hydrological variability, high dependency o f the country on international rivers, and growing
competing water demands by some neighbors and productive and domestic users in Mozambique
represent a serious challenge to long-term growth. The World Bank Group has prepared with
Government and development partners a Country Water Resources Assistance Strategy that
could help plan investments in water infrastructure and improvements in water management
institutions and management practices. The objective o f this strategy i s to help reduce
vulnerability to water shortages, and to provide a minimum platform o f water infrastructure to
underpin growth in water dependent sectors. Priority areas o f intervention identified in the
strategy include: (i)
water resources development and management in the water-stressed south,
specifically in the Incomati and Umbeluzi basins; (ii)
small scale water resources development to
support smallholder irrigation and provide infrastructure for small towns; (iii)assistance to
Government in identifying and implementing the environmental and social requirements for the
development o f large water infrastructure (particularly on the Zambezi River); and (iv)
institution building in the water resources sector.

Telecommunications. Government, with support from the IDA-financed Communica42.
tions Sector Reform Project (Cr. 35770), has fostered an increase in teledensity (fixed and
mobile lines) from 1 percent in 2000 to 9 percent in 2006. Despite this accelerated growth, teledensity i s s t i l l very low, and needs to continue to increase in order to enable growth, especially in
rural areas. The impact o f increased teledensity - and o f information and communications
technologies (ICT) in general - on productivity, commerce, education, communication and
governance (through more transparent access to information) i s widely accepted. GoM’s
ambitious telecommunications targets include: (i)increasing teledensity t o 22 percent by 2009;
(ii)
expanding internet access points by 2009; and (iii)
rapidly scaling up the number o f central,
provincial, district and municipal government institutions linked to the electronic government
network. Government has also prioritized development o f Mozambican skills in science and
technology, including in ICT. PARPA I1 includes targets for increasing the number o f
Mozambicans studying for graduate degrees in science and technology, and the number o f
communities trained in and having access to information and communications technologies.

43.
Mega-projects. Mega-projects, including Mozal Aluminum Iand 11, and the Southern
Africa gas pipeline, are estimated to contribute about 1.6 percentage points to GDP growth
annually. This contribution will likely increase as a number o f proposed mega-projects come on
stream, including: the Moma Heavy Sands titanium mine, which starts production in 2007; the
Moatize coal mine; and the power plant and transmission line associated with Moatize. Further
large projects in the energy sector are under preparation, including the Mphanda Nkuwa hydropower project and a gas-fired power plant in Temane in the South. Furthermore, Mozal i s
planning to build a third aluminum plant. Several large international mining corporations are also
analyzing investment opportunities in the mining sector. While these mega-proj ects are expected
to continue to make major contributions to growth and foreign exchange earnings, their impact
on local employment i s likely to be relatively limited after the construction phase. To increase
their impact in this regard, it i s important to develop SME linkages as has been done by Mozal.

44.
Private Sector Development. Development o f the private sector, including helping firms
move from the informal sector to the formal sector, w i l l be essential to increasing and sustaining
growth and employment generation. Two key PARPA I1objectives that will help promote broadbased growth are increasing support to SMEs, and promoting the tourism sector. S M E s and the
tourism sector hold greater promise for broad-based growth as they help develop the domestic
private sector, generate employment and develop the rural economy, and they can be an effective
way to link the formal and informal economies.

Regional Integration and Trade. Increasing domestic and international trade underpins
45.
Mozambique's growth strategy. Emphasis needs to be placed on regional integration to leverage
economies o f scale and to resolve public goods issues. Because o f the size o f their economies,
human resource pools and especially, the HIV/AIDS crisis, no southern Africa country can
generate high rates o f growth relying only on domestic resources. Mozambique - like i t s
neighbors - has particular interest in regional initiatives to strengthen inter-country transport,
energy markets, use o f international water, communications, food security, and trade financial
and customs systems. More generally, SADC members have defined their priorities over the next
decade to be: (i)
trade liberalization, including the creation o f a Customs Union by 2010 and the
establishment o f a common market by 2015; (ii)financial harmonization, including the
establishment o f a fbll monetary union by 2016; (iii)
development o f regional infrastructure to
facilitate trade, communications, and energy trading and risk management; and (iv) management
o f public health issues, especially HIV/AIDS.
46.
Business Environment, Governance, and PARPA 11 Interventions. Second-generation
reforms improving the investment climate, reforming the legal and judicial sector, improving
public financial management, increasing the quality and quantity o f public services through
reform o f the public administration, decentralization, and a vigorous fight against corruption are
essential to maintain high growth rates and reduce poverty in Mozambique. At the same time,
institution-building, especially at the local level, needs to accelerate, combined with better results
monitoring, and intensified efforts to increase citizens' participation in all aspects o f public l i f e
as this will increase the demand for accountability at the local level. These institutional and
governance reforms need to complement the investments in infrastructure and social services;
otherwise, their impact would be rather limited.
47.
A business environment unfriendly to small and medium enterprises and the informal
sector has hampered growth in both urban and rural areas. There have been some improvements
- e.g., due to recent legal reforms (adoption o f a new Commercial Code and Law on Company
Registries) and electronic business registration, the process to set up a firm i s expected to
decrease to only 35 days in 2007 (from 153 days in 2005 and 111 in 2006) - but much remains to
do; Mozambique was ranked 140 out o f 175 countries in the Doing Business indicators in 2006.''
48.
The labor market i s an area in which significant reform i s awaited. At present, it is
extremely rigid, and i s considered to be among the ten most restrictive globally." The judicial
process also remains cumbersome and complex, and case resolution i s slow, particularly in the
labor courts. Efforts are underway to improve contract enforcement, including the creation o f

'*Doing Business 2007: How to Reform, World Bank, 2006.
~~

l9Ibid

- 14-

commercial sections in the judicial tribunals, but poor contract enforcement continues to
discourage private sector investment. Such hurdles in the business environment have contributed
to the growing prevalence o f systemic corruption, which the 2003 Investment Climate
Assessment flags as one o f the major impediments to growth. Recognizing this, PARPA I1
contains targets to simplify the process o f starting a business, simplify import and export
procedures, approve and implement a new labor law, and limited measures to strengthen the
capacity o f the judicial system.
49.
Inadequate access to finance has hampered the growth o f SMEs, especially in rural areas.
Factors behind this include high interest rates, presence o f secure government investments,
absence o f competition among banks, and weak repayment and collateral enforcement. Many o f
the only 29 percent o f registered companies that have loans on their books have not used formal
financial sector intermediaries. These factors account for this sector’s small and falling
contribution to GDP o f a little above 3 percent in 2006. The World Bank Doing Business survey
ranked Mozambique 143 out o f 178 countries on ease o f getting credit for 2006. PARPA I1
includes goals to improve the performance o f banks, increase access to microfinance for rural
communities, and increase the amount o f loans to the private sector.

Limited administrative capacity at the local level also hinders rural growth and limits
50.
demand for accountability. District and provincial governments are improving their ability to
stimulate investment in community service delivery projects. However, they have yet to
demonstrate significant capability or structure to help organize activities at the local level to
stimulate private sector investment. In general, smallholder farmers need support to organize
themselves in associations that leverage their bargaining power (e.g., relative to large industrial
farming enterprises in outgrower schemes) and share productivity-enhancing agricultural
technologies. The limited capacity o f local government and community organizations also
impedes the demand for accountability at the local level, a major shortfall in the governance
framework. PARPA 11’s rural development strategy foresees developing economic and financial
development agencies and agro-livestock associations, and improving rural communication.
Governance and Accountability

51.
Mozambique’s governance framework i s in transition; its system o f participation and
accountability i s s t i l l young and evolving, and institution building i s in the early stages. Yet,
Government’s goal o f broad-based growth will be impeded if current weaknesses in the
governance framework are not addressed. Further, increasing public dissatisfaction with the
politics o f patronage and clientelism pose a risk to the nascent democratic system and to longterm political stability.
52.
The World Bank Institute’s Governance Matters survey data shows that in 2005
Mozambique’s performance was better than the Sub-Saharan African average in all six
dimensions o f governance, although only barely so for Regulatory Quality, and within the
margin o f error for Rule of Law and Control o f Corruption (see Figure 1).

53.
During 2005 and 2006, €our studies have strengthened government and development
partners’ understanding o f issues affecting governance?’ These analyses have shared the
following conclusions:

*

Corruption i s common in parts of the public sector and in service delivery. In the public
sector, corruption i s more common than elsewhere among the police, the court system,
customs, business licensing, and tax collection. Petty corruption i s common in service
delivery, including in education, health, water and electricity. and other public services that
capture revenues, Main forms o f corruption are bribes and kick-backs. Among large
infrastructure and transport projects, there i s a perception that corruption has been associated
with contract negotiations and procurement processes.
Mozambique perfoms relatively well in the areas o f budget formulation and execution.
However, the 2005 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Assessment
indicates that weaknesses continue in: accounting and audit, especially external audit: cash
management and monitoring o f expenditure payment arrears; transparency in the
procurement process; revenue collection, especially o f the corporate tax base; internal
controls for non-salary expenditure and effectiveness of payroll controls; and, predictability
in the availability o f funds for commitment of expenditures. (See Box 4.)

20 These are: (i}
the 2005 Worfd Bank Institute Anti-Corruption Survey; (ii)the 2006 DFID Strategic Conflict
Assessment; (iii)
the 2005 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment; and (iv) the 2006 USAID
Corruption Assessment.

- 16-

The increasing single party dominance o f all three branches o f the State weakens checks and
balances. Parliament that does not have an effective opposition and the judiciary i s not
considered to be independent.
Civil society organizations, the media, and local community organizations are often not
strong and so have limited voice and participation in political and legislative processes?1

While Government i s gearing up its anti-corruption efforts, there have so far been few
repercussions for those who are corrupt. As it i s now receiving more resources, the Anticorruption Office (GCCC) is increasing the prosecution rate for corruption cases. (See
Appendix 6 CAS Completion Report.)

-

Access to justice i s often beyond the reach o f the average Mozambican, especially in rural
areas. Logistical challenges limit the geographical reach o f t h e courts. Community courts the most visible face o f justice for much o f Mozambique - receive little support fiom the
state. Private lawyers’ services are priced well beyond the reach o f the average citizen.
Box 3. Mozambique’s Public Financial Management
The 2005 Public Expenditure Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment reviewed Mozambique’s public financial
management systems at the end o f 2004. I t found:

Overall, Mozambique performed well in the areas o f budget formulation and allocation. The budget is a credible
and realistic instrument that i s generally implemented as intended. Budget allocations have been consistently in
line with sector policies and PARPA objectives. Budget execution is, on average, close to the initially approved
allocations, but there i s still weak capacity o f Government to mobilize local counterpart finding for foreign
financing. Financial management systems for budget execution are steadily improving, especially since the
implementation o f an integrated financial management and information system for the central public
administration, called e-SISTAFE. The current challenge i s to roll-out e-SISTAFE to districts and
municipalities.
Monitoring o f expenditure payment arrears i s weak. Predictability in the availability o f funds for commitment
o f expenditures is undermined by high levels o f off-budget spending particularly for external project finance.
(Development partners have since improved their reporting on project and program aid. and the use o f national
procedures, and most o f their support i s now reported on the Treasury account.)
Mozambique scores poorly on indicators for: oversight o f aggregate fiscal risk f i o m other public sector entities;
extent of unreported government operations; and transparency o f inter-governmental fiscal operations.
High level o f tax exemptions (particularly for mega-projects) and non-compliance of, and significant
inefficiencies in, tax enforcement limit expansion o f the tax base and revenue collection. In 2005, the revenue
reform process has focused explicitly on improving tax enforcement.
The audit function still requires significant attention, including expanding the limited coverage o f external
audit: only a quarter o f government entities i s audited annually.
Transparency in procurement is weak. Less than half o f contracts above the national threshold for small
purchases are awarded on an open competitive basis. A new Procurement Code was approved in December
2005. It adheres to international standards and revises the institutional set-up; its implementation started in late
2006.
Internal controls are weak (no central reconciliation), creating real possibilities for “ghost workers” and for staff
to receive pay from more than one payroll.
Reforms implemented ‘in 2005 and 2006 would significantly increase Mozambique’s PEFA scores for 2006 in
policy-based budgeting, cash management, comprehensiveness and transparency o f budget management, and
revenue collection and management. The next PEFA assessment i s scheduled for 2008.
21 There are allegations that members o f the media have been intimidated and a well known journalist was
assassinatedin 200 1. Nevertheless, the media are fiee by international comparison and represent an important voice.

- 17-

54.
In response to these findings, the Government o f Mozambique prepared an Anticorruption Strategy for the period 2006-2010, approved by the Council o f Ministers in April
2006. The strategy’s principles include: zero tolerance, emphasis on prevention, promotion o f
investigation o f cases, and citizens’ participation. The National Anti-Comption Plan was
approved by the Council o f Ministers in February 2007. This plan includes sector anti-corruption
plans from several
a results framework, and institutional arrangements for
implementation. The Inter-Ministerial Commission for Public Sector Reform, chaired by the
Prime Minister, i s charged with providing political leadership for the implementation and
monitoring o f the Anti-Corruption Strategy; a Technical Commission and Anti-corruption
Forums (at national, provincial and district levels, integrating representatives o f civil society, the
public sector and the private sector) have also been established. The Technical Commission i s
empowered to oversee, monitor and implement the strategy and the forums serve as consultation
mechanisms. PARPA I1 also includes actions for improving transparency in the budget planning
and implementation process, and for increasing citizen access to information concerning public
resources and service delivery. (The pillars and focus areas o f PARPA I1are presented in Box 5.)
55.
During the last CAS period (2003-7), the World Bank Group and development partners
helped raise the profile o f governance concerns. IDA and others o f the G18 focused general
budget support on improving the supply side o f the governance framework, including public
financial management systems and public sector reform. Although implementation o f agreed
changes has been slower than expected, especially in civil service reform, progress in these
prioritized areas has been steady. However, development partners and Government have done
less on the demand side o f good governance, and there has been growing realization that more
effort i s needed to increase citizen demand for accountability.
56.
Development partners have collaborated to address governance issues in line with their
comparative advantages. For example, the Netherlands and FA0 focus on land and
environmental management. Denmark has supported the modernization o f the legal framework
and improving the quality o f the judiciary through training; recently, along with the European
Union and Ireland, it also has supported audits o f the justice sector. Sweden and Ireland have
focused on public financial management and audit systems; the former has provided support to
the audit section o f the Administrative Tribunal. The European Union has focused on electoral
systems. The European Union and UNDP have also supported institutional strengthening and
reform in the justice sector. One o f UNDP’s main priorities i s strengthening the criminal justice
and prison systems. The UK and Ireland are providing funding for non-governmental and civil
society organizations to improve governance more generally. IDA will contribute to the
development o f baselines for key outcomes in the Anti-Corruption Strategy results framework
through the recently restructured Public Sector Reform Project, and will coordinate a second
Anti-corruption Survey to check progress against the 2004 Survey results.
As Mozambique is a diverse and large country, the policy direction taken by Government
57.
towards decentralization can help foster public accountability to citizens by bringing
Government closer to the people. Currently, municipalities are the only truly decentralized
entities; mayors and city councils are elected. Districts and provinces are still centrally-controlled

22

Ministry o f Interior, Ministry o f Education & Culture, Ministry o f Finance, Ministry of Health, and Justice Sector.

Box 4. PARPA J I Pillars and Focus Areas
Unlike the sectoral approach in PARPA I,PARPA I1 uses a pillar approach based on the five-year government
program. PARPA I1 has three main pillars, a foundation o f macroeconomic and public financial management, and
eight cross-cutting topics.

Pillar One - Governance: PARPA I1 sets out a broad and ambitious agenda o f institutional reforms in public
administration, public financial management, decentralization by devolution, the judiciary sector, and anticorruption measures. These are t o be complemented b y increasing popular participation at the local level, focusing
on the district and municipality as the key unit o f service delivery. The reforms in public administration w i l l include
a census o f all civil servants, the formulation o f a new salary policy, and hnctional analysis o f the key ministries t o
provide better services. Decentralization reform includes the devolution o f some functions to the district
administration, an increase in the number o f municipalities with elected city governments, and a rethink o f intergovernmental fiscal relations and resource transfers to local governments. Reforms in the judiciary sector w i l l
address inefficiencies and lack o f capacity in the administration o f justice with the objective o f makingjustice more
accessible. Key elements o f the anti-corruption strategy include the reduction o f red tape, increased transparency in
public financial management and access to information by the public, and strengthening o f institutions that
prosecute corruption.
Pillar Two - H u m a n Capital: Improvements in human capital w i l l be sought through interventions in the social
sectors and infrastructure. Key objectives include the reduction o f child and maternal mortality, almost doubling the
number o f people benefiting from anti-retroviral treatment o f HIV/AIDS, increasing the net schooling rate and the
completion rate o f primary education for girls, improving the quality o f teaching by reducing the student-teacher
ratio, increasing access to drinking water, and expanding social protection programs. PARPA I1 adopts a holistic
view towards human development and skills development by, inter alia, attaching importance to technical and
vocational training and tertiary education. PARPA I1 further identifies science and technology as a cross-cutting
priority sector.
Pillar Three - Economic Development: This pillar addresses the improvement o f the investment climate and
removing key constraints to growth. Reforms and measures under this pillar are aimed at: (i)
macroeconomic
management; (ii)
improving the business environment; (iii)
development o f the financial system; (iv) promoting the
creation o f a strong, dynamic, competitive, and innovative private sector; (v) promoting the priority sectors,
broadening the business class, and creating jobs (including in agriculture and agrarian services, natural resource
management, industry, fisheries, tourism, mineral extraction, o i l exploration, and several employment creation
programs); (vi) improving the integration o f Mozambique into the regional and international economy; and (vii)
promoting the integration and consolidation o f the domestic market. The latter includes road and water transport,
ports and railways, bridges, marketing systems, and regulation o f internal trade.
Cross-cutting .Objectives: PARPA I1 places focus on cross-cutting areas that require multi-sector collaboration.
These include: rural development, environment, HIV-AIDS, gender, science and technology, natural disaster
management, de-mining, food and nutritional security.

although deconcentration o f functions and responsibilities has begun. In 2007,
provincial assemblies will be elected for the first time. The gradual empowerment o f district
governments and local consultative councils, as well as PARPA 11’s objective o f increasing the
number o f municipalities, will enhance citizen participation in government. Legislation approved
in 2004 made districts a budget entity, and requires approval by district consultative councils o f
budgets. Criteria adopted in 2007 increase the proportion o f investment budget to be executed by
district governments. A comprehensive decentralization approach by the major sectors i s still
needed; i t w i l l help ensure effective allocations o f functions, finances and human resources for
local service delivery, and therefore help improve service delivery.
Despite the achievements o f decentralization, slow progress in institutional and civil
58.
service reform undermines the efficiency o f public institutions and their accountability to the
public. While organizational reforms are underway in several ministries and within the civil
service in general, progress has occurred at a slower pace than expected. Preparatory measures to
reform the civil service and pave the way for salary reform have been taken, including the
creation in 2006 of the National Civil Service Authority, implementation o f a civil servant
census, and development o f the Civil Servant Register. In light o f concerns relating to leadership
and program content, the scope o f the Public Sector Reform Program (Phase 2, FY03-10) has
been narrowed, with a greater focus on i t s impact on service delivery. Notwithstanding these
actions, the lack o f progress on the reform o f the administrative framework raises fundamental
issues about how to elicit the best performance out o f civil servants, and risks undermining civil
servant accountability to the public.

11. THE BANK GROUP STRATEGY: AN INTEGRATED APPROACH
The new strategy o f the World Bank Group to support the development o f Mozambique
59.
over 2007-1 1 will employ an integrated approach that stresses poverty-reducing growth,
collaboration with development partners, focus on cross-cutting themes, mainstreaming
governance and capacity development, and focus on results. These operating principles build on
lessons from the implementation o f the 2003-7 strategy. They are also in line with the pillars
stressed in the World Bank Group’s Afiica Action Plan presented to the Board o f the World
Bank on March 20, 2007: Accelerating Shared Growth, Building Capable States, Sharpening
Focus on Results, Strengthening the Development Parherhips.

Building on Lessons Learned

A discussion o f lessons learned from the previous CAS implementation i s at Appendix 6.
60.
The major lessons relevant for the new strategy are:
0

Understand better the country’s political economy and reflect in the design of studies and
projects. Political economy factors are central to the stalled implementation o f several
projects and some non-lending initiatives, and are key to effective development in general.
Political realities should be taken into account in the timing and content o f projects.
Attention has to be paid to how political economy factors impact government ownership o f
projects.

- 20 -

a

Effectively address recurrent portfolio issues, especially counterpart funding and VAT
refunds. Two issues that are closely linked to the political economy and to the country's
financial management system are counterpart funding and VAT refunds. Lack o f counterpart
funds has hampered the implementation progress o f several projects in the portfolio during
the last three years; and slow or insufficient VAT refunds to contractors has resulted in
higher costs for infrastructure projects and projects that involve building o f public works.
The Bank Group will consider these issues in h t u r e project designs, as well as help
Government address weaknesses in related budget and financial management systems. For
the current and new portfolio, 100 percent financing will be used as permitted in Bank
guidelines and where ownership i s not an issue.
Articulate the Bank Group 's requirements regarding country systems related to financial
management, procurement and audits, and work with Government and development partners
to develop a capacity development plan for these areas. This step is required in accordance
with the Paris Declaration but it i s also necessary to accommodate plans for the greater use o f
sector wide approaches and common fund arrangements. Several attempts to j o i n common
fund arrangements in the past have been unsuccessful in terms o f Bank involvement (while
others have worked). In addition to assessing the current state o f government procurement
and financial management systems against Bank Group requirements, the Bank Group will
help Government draft a capacity development plan for these areas to address capacity gaps,
especially for district administrations. Attention will also be paid to enhancing t h e
participation o f the local populations, in planning and budgeting, and in ensuring
transparency and accountability in the use o f public funds at that level.
More realistic targets for the Bank strategy (CPS), and distinguishing of PAF targets (of the
broader group of development partners) versus CPS targets. Because o f the challenge o f
attribution, PAF targets should only be selectively included in the CPS results framework,
e.g., if they are triggers in the PRSC series, or if the Bank Group program i s the main source
o f support for achieving the target.
Simpler design and better project preparation to ensure a f i t with government
implementation capacity, as well as to reinforce government capacity. Project design i s
often overly complex. Available capacity needs to be an important design criterion.
Similarly, projects need to: use project preparation facilities to ensure implementation
readiness; reduce the creation o f parallel project implementation units and give more
responsibilities to line ministries; and include govenunent procurement and financial
management staff as part o f the preparation team. Projects also need to plan for more realistic
implementation timeframes and rapid start-up. Stronger preparation and implementation
readiness (through dialogue and relationship building) are also key to an effective portfolio.
Coordinate capacity building efforts across the World Bank Group with Government and
with development partners. Bank staff need to develop an overall strategic framework for
capacity building, in coordination with development partners and Government. Important
considerations in this are: (i)
capacity building needs and gaps (especially at the sub-national
level), (ii)
capacity needed for engagement in any field, and (iii)
interventions aligned to
available capacity. Finally, results measurement for capacity building needs to be improved.
Improve coordination and dissemination of analytic work. h a l y t i c a l and advisory work
conducted during the CAS period have been relevant and of high quality. Their findings are

-21 -

used to inform subsequent project design and policy dialogue. Improvements can be made,
however, in the collaborative selection o f topics and t h e design o f joint work programs,
timing, and dissemination. Analytical work must also be unequivocally demand-driven.
0

Address governance issues in all operations. Corruption in service delivery and procurement
processes (even where activities are not using Bank funds) undermines the performance o f
Bank Group operations and their impact on poverty alleviation. Strategies to be pursued by
the Bank Group to address this issue include: mainstreaming citizen scorecards q d other
local accountability mechanisms (as done by Decentralized Planning and Finance (Cr.
H0670) and ProMaputo (Cr. 42570)); and putting in place sector governance and
accountability frameworks (as done in Roads and Bridges (Cr.35500) and National Water
Development I1 (Cr. 32470)), and capacity development in fiduciary areas. The
implementation o f the procurement code, including at the district level, will be monitored.

Valued Partnerships
61.
Partnership with Government. The Government o f Mozambique values Bank Group
support. It has indicated that projects garner greater support within Government and
communities where there i s involvement o f the World Bank Group. The knowledge, capacity
building and influence generated by the Bank Group’s policy dialogue, analytical and advisory
services, and lending support i s recognized, as is IDA assistance particularly in the areas o f
education, health, and infrastructure, The Bank Group also offers significant combined resources
fkom IDA, IBRD, IFC, and MIGA to support private sector development. Other competencies
that are especially valued include expertise in financial management, procurement, expenditure
management, resource mobilization, poverty diagnostics, and results management.
62.
Partnership with Development Partners. The Bank Group’s role as a convener o f
development partners and catalyst for reform i s generally appreciated, and the increasing
presence o f staff in Maputo enhances the Bank Group’s ability to perform these functions. All
development partners and Government deserve credit for having significantly advanced the
harmonization agenda in Mozambique and for having successfully implemented best practice
coordination mechanisms, including for providing general budget support, implementing Paris
Declaration objectives, and general coordination on assistance strategies.
63.
A Memorandum o f Understanding (MoU) was signed in 2004 between Government and
the development partners providing general budget support (G18 Program Aid Partners). Two
fundamental principles o f this M o U are predictability and alignment with the domestic budget
cycle. Support for the upcoming year i s based on the assessment o f a “Joint Review” o f the
previous year, conducted among the development partners and Government, which looks at
government performance against an agreed performance framework (the Performance
Assessment Framework, or “PAF”). The M o U also indicates that disbursements for general
budget support can be interrupted if Government does not pursue certain undertakings, including
macro-economic stability and commitment to sustainable poverty reduction.
64.
Additional progress has been made in implementing the Paris Declaration for the 2006
and 2007 budget cycles (see Appendix 9), especially facilitated by the development o f
mechanisms to bring project aid on-budget (e.g., the Medium-Term Fiscal Framework, and a

- 22 -

project database and website listing support from all development partners). Previously,
development assistance had not been factored into resource allocation decisions, an issue that
undermined the principle o f comprehensive budgeting. In addition, development partners have
set 2010 targets for Paris Declaration indicators. Since the 2005 review o f the performance of the
Program A i d Partners, the World Bank Group has been making progress against most o f these
targets. Notably, the World Bank Group i s focusing on increasing the number o f joint missions
and joint analytical work, and reducing the number o f PIUs. The World Bank Group i s also
providing support to Government in financial management and procurement to facilitate the use
o f country systems.

65.
Development partners have aligned their support to the PARPA I1 and have jointly
agreed which donor(s) will take lead responsibility in each focus area, building o n their
comparative advantage. Appendix 2a lists the PARPA I1 areas o f focus o f each partner and
Appendix 2b provides a full list o f participants in the respective working groups. For example,
among France’s focus areas are health and the environment; Italy’s are public financial
management and budget management and agriculture; the Netherlands focuses on
decentralization, education and health; Denmark on municipal development and justice systems;
Switzerland on water and sanitation and governance reform; Germany o n public financial
management and the financial sector; the European Commission on electoral systems, the
judicial sector, agriculture and health; Ireland o n public sector reform; the FAO, IFAD, and
Sweden o n agriculture; USA on governance, service delivery, the environment and private sector
development; the UK on private sector development, the financial sector and transport; and the
Africa Development Bank on financial sector and infrastructure development.

66.
The benefits o f the growing collaboration among development partners and with
Government are evident. Better reporting o f project expenditures by development partners has
resulted in getting most external aid flows on-budget, which facilitates budget management.
Increased joint missions and joint analytical work are placing less o f a burden on government
counterparts, and helping to improve product quality and service delivery efficiency.
Collaboration in the development o f country strategies i s helping Government address resource
gaps in the implementation o f PARPA 11. At the same time, coordination and harmonization i s
time-consuming, and significant work remains.
67.
Emerging partners such as the Government o f China, the US Millennium Challenge
Corporation, and private foundations (such as the Clinton Foundation and the Gates Foundation)
are changing the development context in Mozambique. The risks and opportunities presented by
these emerging partners have significant implications for the World Bank Group’s business
model. During the CPS period, the Bank will continue to explore ways o f enhancing i t s business
and operational models to improve effectiveness in this new context. Accessing the entire range
o f products available across the World Bank Group - national and regional IDA resources, IFC,
MIGA, IBRD partial risk guarantees, carbon financing and various trust funds, including the
Global Environmental Facility, and so on - as well as systematically exploring co-financing
opportunities with development partners i s a start.
68.
Partnership with Civil Society and the Private Sector. The Bank Group will continue to
strengthen i t s work with civil society organizations and the private sector, both to facilitate

-23

-

growth and good governance and to strengthen demand for accountability. Regular consultations
are planned with civil society organizations, including NGOs, think tanks, and academic
institution, and private sector players. The Bank team will consult with these partners during the
design, implementation and supervision o f studies and operations, as appropriate. The advice o f
these partners was sought during the development o f the CPS (see Appendix 3).

69.
As deeper partnering with civil society and the private sector, and a focus on citizen
accountability and voice, are relatively new areas for the World Bank Group in Mozambique, the
Bank team will be looking to learn from development partners who have been more active in this
area, and from World Bank Group experiences in other countries. Bank staff working with
Mozambique are in touch with their colleagues in the external relations unit to develop an
outreach and knowledge dissemination strategy, and with the World Bank Institute (MI)and
the social development unit to mainstream social accountability mechanisms in the portfolio.
Other activities to a similar end under discussion include: building the capacity o f civil society
organizations and the media to monitor government; using citizen scorecards and surveys to
involve citizens in planning and monitoring public service delivery; and working with
Government to increase citizens’ access to information on the budget, procurement procedures
and transactions, service delivery costs, and users’ rights.

70.
Partnership with Other Countries. In the longer term, Mozambique’s continuing
development will depend significantly on the country’s vision for the role that it should play in
Sub-Saharan Africa and in the larger international context. As a relatively small country with
correspondingly small market power and resources, Mozambique’s longer-term growth strategy
needs to be built on i t s comparative and strategic advantages and complementarities within
southern Africa. As mentioned in paragraph 45, Mozambique will seek to partner with other
countries, especially with neighbors in southern Africa, to implement the Southern Africa
Development Community (SADC) priorities, deal with public goods and transboundary issues,
and to strengthen inter-country transport, energy markets, use o f international water,
communications, food security, and trade financial and customs systems, and to deal more
effectively with HIV/AIDS. During the next four years, the World Bank Group will work with
Government to help explore and take advantage o f such regional integration and growth
opportunities, especially relative to neighboring countries and SADC.
Guiding Principles for a New Partnership Strategy: Collaborate - Focus - Deliver
Three key overarching principles will guide Bank Group staff working on Mozambique
71.
during the CPS period. These are: Collaborate - Focus - Deliver.

72.
Collaborate. The new Country Partnership Strategy will strive to achieve significant
impact, be cost-effective, and ensure sustainability o f reforms, capital investments, and capacity
building efforts. In this regard, neither Government nor the Bank Group can afford to act alone.
In addition to collaborating with Government and the partners listed above, the Bank will
continue to collaborate with neighboring Bank country departments to leverage our combined
knowledge and human resources to improve our efficiency and effectiveness, including the
department working with South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland, Namibia, Madagascar
and Mauritius on the one hand, and that responsible for Tanzania and Uganda o n the other.

- 24 -

73.
Drawing upon the lessons o f the previous CAS, the new strategy will emphasize a
programmatic and cross-sectoral approach. To leverage the Bank Group’s support, the strategy
will also favor activities that are linked to a larger program that is supported by multiple
development partners. Each Bank Group project preparation team will seek to include as relevant
specialists from IDA, IFC, MIGA and WBI, in order to systematically explore collaboration
opportunities across the Bank Group. Similarly, the Bank will exploit opportunities from global
and bilateral development partner programs and other Bank Group resources, including regional
initiatives such as the Africa Catalytic Fund and the Africa capacity building program, CDMAP;
global programs such as the Carbon Fund and the Global Environmental Facility; and Bank
Group global products such as guarantees.

74.
Focus. The Bank Group recognizes Government’s leadership in coordinating
development partners. It also recognizes that the country’s needs well exceed what the Bank
Group can provide in terms o f advice and financing. It will, therefore, continue to consult
extensively with Government and with development partners to identifj areas where the Bank
Group can utilize i t s comparative advantage. For example, other development partners are taking
the lead in the areas o f primary education, food security, and environmental management, while
the Bank Group will increasingly focus on institutional reforms, and infrastructure and rural
development. A recent example o f leveraging non-traditional resources to enable the use o f IDA
resources in other less-funded areas (in this case, water resource management) i s the linkages
established with the Millennium Development Corporation and the Africa Catalytic Growth
Fund to support the expansion o f water supply programs through the FY07 Water Services and
Institutional Support Project.

75.

Deliver. In order to help Government achieve PARPA I1outcomes, the Bank Group will
aggressively address poor portfolio performance, incorporating lessons learned from the CAS
Completion Report (Appendix 6). Realistic outcomes will be defined for all interventions through strengthened and simplified project design. Rigorous results monitoring will help ensure
that implementation o f the strategy i s on track. This will also require attention to planned results
during project design. Required changes to the portfolio due to performance issues or to
unexpected changes in the operating environment will be addressed quickly and proactively with
the range o f instruments and resources available within the Bank Group. The Bank Group i s
redefining criteria for the use o f country systems to accelerate the harmonization o f financial
management, procurement and auditing procedures among partners and Government.
The Bank Group will continue to invest in demand-driven analytical and advisory
76.
activities (AAA), drawing from its global knowledge and international experience. T h i s nonlending support encompasses: economic and sector work, which underpins our policy dialogue
with the client as well as lays the foundation for effective lending; and technical assistance that
can be flexibly used to enhance capacity and help Government implement reforms. In some
sectors or themes, analytical and advisory activities will form the sole source o f support from the
Bank Group, as financing from other development partners are leveraged. AAA will be
organized around the three main pillars o f the strategy, and will reflect the need to: address
knowledge gaps and deepen understanding in particular areas; facilitate policy dialogue; and
provide greater support for government programs, as may be requested. To this end, outputs will
be tailored to the particular issue and audience. Hence, in some cases the Bank Group will need

- 25 -

to be particularly agile and responsive, drawing upon global knowledge to provide just-in-time
advice. At other times, more comprehensive analysis will be required. Incorporating lessons
learned from the previous CAS period, where the poor dissemination and supply-driven nature o f
some AAA were problems, the following principles have been defined for AAA work:
Listen to the client to understand their needs for technical assistance and to help them address
key knowledge gaps, and ensure genuine demand for specific activities.

Identify upfront the intended impact of the activity, and specify how the baseline and results
will be measured.
Coordinate closely with Government, academic institutions, and development partners to
leverage resources and promote synergies, ideally as joint products.
’

Ensure that the key stakeholders are involved in shaping the emerging ‘findings fiom the
earliest stages, and that dissemination i s just one part o f the consensus building process.
Exploit the range o f World Bank Group resources in the preparation, implementation, and
dissemination o f AAA, including the World Bank Institute and the access offered by the
Global Distance Learning Network.

77.

This more integrated approach has already begun in FY07 (see Box 6 for one example).
Sector wide approaches and common funds will be expanded to increase synergies and reduce
transaction costs for the client and partners. Country systems will also be utilized for the same
reason, although in some areas this will require significant increase in country capacity. Budget
support will be provided through PRSCs in line with the Paris Declaration, G18 targets and
World Bank Group guidelines. Annual priority objectives defined with development partners
will be included as indicative triggers in the PRSC series which will comprise approximately 40
percent o f the IDA financing envelope if PAF targets in the core governance areas are achieved.
Box 5. The Bank Group’s Engagement Principals at Work
Preparation of the Maputo Municipal Development Program (ProMaputo) in FY07 illustrates the Bank Group’s

engagement principles at work. ProMaputo aims to strengthen the capacity of Maputo Municipality (CMM) in
governance, planning, financial management, and service delivery. It also addresses cross-cutting priorities of
Government and the Bank Group, including enhanced accountability, combating corruption, promoting publicprivate partnerships, and addressing the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Citizen report cards and community participation in
planning and budgeting, both linked to a comprehensive municipal communication strategy, will increase CMM
responsiveness to civil society concerns. Increased transparency, administrative reform, and systematic audits will
contribute to reduced corruption in municipal management. With the support of PPIAF, Maputo will pilot publicprivate partnerships as an option for leveraging its limited fmancial and management capacities to improve priority
services. For HIV/AIDS, the municipality will implement a workplace program supported by the National AID
Commission (CNCS).
During program preparation, systematic consultation of municipal interest groups, including low-income community
residents, local political representatives, NGO/civil society leaders, private sector and public utility managers, and
central government officials, ensured that ProMaputo both responds to and engages the contributions Maputojs key
social, political, and economic stakeholders. A comprehensive institutional reform and capacity building process
based on mainstreaming program activities in permanent municipal units for strategic planning, procurement,
revenue administration and expenditure control will ensure CMM leadership, ownership, and the sustainability of
governance and management improvements. Service improvement benchmarking, participatory monitoring and
periodic citizen report cards will serve to maintain the program’s performance focus as emphasis gradually shifts
Eom institutionalreform and strengthening internal capacity to its ultimate goals: achieving better living conditions
for Maputo’s poor communities and more dynamic growth among the city’s businesses.

- 26 -

Lending and Non-LendingStrategy

78.
I n line with these engagement principles, the overall goal o f t h i s Country Partnership
Strategy i s to promote shared growth within the context o f the country’s own development
strategy (PARPA 11). The strategy encompasses three pillars, corresponding to the PARPA I1
pillars. Pillar I,Increased Accountability and Public Voice supports PARPA 11’s Governance
pillar. Pillar 11, Equitable Access to Key Services, supports objectives under PARPA 11’s Human
Development pillar. And, Piliar 111, Equitable and Broad-based Growth, supports PARPA 11’s
Economic Development pillar. An overview o f the major objectives and outcomes defined for
each pillar i s included below. Five major result areas have been defined encompassing 18
development outcomes. The Results Framework i s at Appendix 1. All CPS outcomes support
key outcomes in PARPA 11. The indicative lending program i s listed in Appendix 4a (with
possible Bank Group financing sources at Appendix 4b). Appendix 5 lists IDA interventions
since 2000, and also shows current operations that will be active during the CPS period.

79.

The formulation o f CPS objectives and outcomes took into account PARPA 11, the PAF,
the MDGs, Paris Declaration indicators, IDA-14 requirements, the World Bank Group’s Africa
Action Plan (AAP), and the programs and priorities of other development partners. The drivers
o f growth selected for the CPS align with the flagships o f the Africa Action Plan, namely (i)
strengthen the African private sector; (ii)
increase the economic empowerment o f women; (iii)
build skills for competitiveness in a global economy; (iv) raise agricultural productivity; (v)
improve access to and the reliability o f clean energy; (vi) expand and upgrade road networks and
transit corridors; (vii) increase access to safe water and sanitation; and (viii) strengthen national
health care systems and combat malaria and HIV/AIDS.

8 1.
The PRSC series will closely support outcomes in this pillar. Indicative triggers include:
maintaining expenditures for priority sectors in budget planning and execution in line with the
Medium-Term Expenditure Framework; expanding the rollout o f basic functionality o f eSISTAFE to all ministries and districts; increasing the capacity o f the Central Revenue
Authority; increasing the number o f central and provincial level bodies with operational internal
controls; increasing the number o f financial audits; increasing government revenues; and
increasing the disposition o f court cases. Triggers to support milestones in decentralization (e.g.,
implementation o f the National Decentralization Strategy) and to implement the new
procurement system at the district level, will also build the capacity o f district-level government.
82.
Three other existing programs and two planned programs support Government’s public
sector reform program and decentralization strategy:
0

0

The Public Sector Reform Project (Grant H024-MOZ) i s an existing program that seeks to:
improve the organizational efficiency o f selected public sector institutions at central and local
levels through restructuring the ministries; strengthen public sector capacity in the areas o f
planning and financial management, including procurement (implementation o f e-SISTAFE
at the central, provincial and district levels i s key to achieving this objective); support the
Tribunal Administrativo (TA)23in undertaking audits for the central, provincial, and district
governments; improve access to and the quality o f selected priority public services; improve
legal and judicial services in selected provinces; and, improve the quality and availability o f
statistical data for public and private sector needs. T h i s project was restructured in FY07 to
improve performance and to add the Legal Services component.

The first phase (APL1) o f the Maputo Municipal Development Program (ProMaputo, Cr.
42570) began implementation in FY07. This program seeks to build the capacity o f the
Maputo municipal government to better deliver public services. A second phase (APL2) i s
planned to deepen the reforms initiated in A P L l .
The National Decentralized Planning and Finance Program, a multi-donor operation, will
scale up to all districts the current IDA and partner program, Decentralized Planning and
Finance Program (Cr. H0670), which supports capacity building o f selected districts in
finance and budget management. A SWAP will be explored for the follow-on program.

83.
Analytical and advisory activities that will support this pillar comprise three main
thematic areas, First, analytical work to examine the mechanisms for local government financing
and accountability and assessing municipal development will support Government’s
decentralization program. The analysis o f municipal development in Mozambique, including
lessons learned from IDA’Srecently-closed operation (Municipal Development - Cr.35490), will
help inform whether IDA should support a follow-on national municipal development operation.
Second, the use o f public resources at the sector level (e.g., in health, education, agriculture,
water, and infrastructure), will be examined jointly with Government and the G18 partners
through sector-specific Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys. A value-for-money audit o f the
justice sector (also with some other development partners) will give further insights and
recommendations into the effective use o f public resources. An assessment o f the new
procurement system (with OECD and G18 partners) and a second Public Expenditure Financial
23

The Administrative Court, an independent agency tasked, inter alia, with auditing Government.

-28-

Accountability Assessment (also jointly with some G18 partners) will provide an update on the
key public financial management reforms. The ESW work on procurement (FYO8) will be
similar to a Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) assessing what stage the
procurement system has reached, defining performance indicators (based on O E C D D A C
methodology), and proposing the monitoring system to be put in place. This ESW will be based
on extensive consultation with Government and development partners. In addition, the Bank
Group will work with Government to develop a capacity development plan for procurement and
financial management, including for district governments, as discussed in paragraph 60. Third, a
program o f analytical work and technical assistance will help strengthen the governance
framework. T h i s will include: governance assessments o f sectors in which the Bank i s engaged
and the use o f these findings to inform Government’s Anti-Corruption Plan; a legal and judicial
review led by the European Commission and the Netherlands (jointly with the G18); and
technical assistance to improve public demand for accountability, including activities to
strengthen media, NGO and community organization oversight of government activities, build
the capacity o f community institutions, and institutionalize citizen feedback mechanisms.

Activities in Pillar I1 support Result Area 3: Improved Government EfSectiveness in the
Provision of Services, and the achievement o f five service delivery outcomes. Seven current
operations, four planned operations, and two potential regional operations support this pillar.
0

Currently, the MAP HIV/AIDS project (Grant No. H0300) and the Regional HIV/AIDS
Treatment Acceleration Project (Grant No. H1040) are providing support to Government’s
HIV/AIDS strategy by building the capacity o f the national HIV/AIDS secretariat, CNCS,
and by increasing access to treatment. A follow-on HIV/AIDS SWAP i s planned to provide
further support to CNCS and to put in place sustainable implementation arrangements. The
possibility o f implementing a Southern Africa Regional HIV/AIDS Program with
neighboring countries will be explored. HIV/AIDS interventions will also be mainstreamed
systematically in all World Bank Group projects. Finally, IDA will work with IFC to scale up
the IFC-supported model for assistance to SMEs with HIV/AIDS education programs. T h i s
initiative, which has been successfully launched, raises awareness o f private sector
employees and S M E s to issues related to HIV/AIDS.

A SWAP planned to support Government’s Health Service Delivery Program (HSDP) will
provide financing to implement an integrated service delivery strategy that focuses on child
and maternal health and that involves facility-based services, outreach, and community-based
care. Government would start scaling up services in the northern provinces that generally
have less access to healthcare and poorer health indicators, and then expand gradually south

- 29-

as financing becomes available and experience and capacity improve. Also, in the scope o f
the HSDP the Bank will provide assistance to the Ministry o f Health to improve its planning
systems including the planning o f investments and the medium term expenditure framework
that should guide prioritization and spending in accordance with the existing resource
envelope. A possible Regional Health Worker Training Program will allow Mozambique to
collaborate with neighboring countries to leverage economies o f scale and cross-country
learning in the training o f health workers.
Two existing IDA projects support higher education objectives. The Higher Education
Project (Cr.36090) aims to improve equitable access to and quality o f higher education. The
Technical, Vocational Education and Training Project (Cr. 41560) aims to improve access
and quality o f technical and vocational education. A follow-on higher education project
focusing on improving skills in science and technology is planned to support the goal o f
improving the quality o f higher education.
The existing National Water Development Project I1 (Cr. 32470) and the proposed FY07
Water Services and Institutional Support Project aim to expand access to urban water and put
institutional arrangements in place to facilitate increasing access to rural water. Additional
financing from the Africa Catalytic Growth Fund, Program on Output-Based Aid, and
Millennium Challenge Corporation have been leveraged for t h i s program.
The recently restructured Energy Reform and Access Project (Cr.38 190), with financing
from the Global Environmental Facility, will build solar photovoltaic systems in schools,
clinics and administrative posts in rural areas in order to increase access to sustainable energy
for these rural institutions (as well as increase household connections). A planned follow-on
project (Phase 2) will pursue similar objectives during the latter years o f the CPS period.
85.
Analytical and advisory support for the objectives o f this pillar will include an update o f
the Benefit Incidence Analysis using national household survey data, and a series o f Beneficiary
Assessment Surveys to gauge the level o f user satisfaction with service provision. These surveys
and benefit analysis, together with sector expenditure reviews discussed in Pillar I,will help
Government fine-tune public sector reforms to further improve service delivery and to ensure
that public funds reach their intended targets. IDA will also undertake specific poverty and
social impact analyses o f major reforms planned by Government. This will include continued
work on the Poverty Social Impact Analysis, which looks at the impact o f the 2005 abolition o f
school fees in primary education, and the baseline analysis on access to secondary education.

Activities in this pillar support two major result areas: Enabling International and Local
Investments and Strengthening Economic Growth Potential. Significant investments to unleash
the potential o f the rural economy, improvements in the investment climate, and M h e r second
generation institutional reforms are required to achieve the nine outcomes and the objective o f
sustained shared growth. The partnership strategy will support second generation reforms and the
removal o f binding constraints to growth by financing investments in infrastructure, rural
development, business climate, and regional integration. These investments will help lay the
foundation for sustainable and broad-based growth. Deepening and broadening the private sector
will create jobs and generate significant resources for development, including tax revenue, which
combined with improved tax administration, could improve Government’s fiscal position and
thus reduce dependence on development partner assistance. Other major policy areas that
require attention are regulatory reforms in key sectors, such as transport and energy, the financial
sector and labor market policy. Also important will be greater collaboration with neighbors on
trade, transport, energy, water resource management, communications, and HIV/AIDS.
87.
The rational and sustainable development o f natural resources, including b y megaprojects, could: (i)allow increased spending on poverty alleviation and the MDGs; (ii)
significantly augment Mozambique’s and the region’s electricity supply; (iii)
allow improved
control o f water flows on the Zambezi and other international rivers (with benefits for flood
control, power generation, agriculture and aquaculture, and urban and rural water supply); and
(iv) protect the enviro&ent.

88.
The PRSC series and eleven current (including FY07 pipeline) and thirteen planned
operations, including four to five regional operations, support the nine outcomes in Pillar 111:
0

A private sector development program will incorporate follow-on objectives to the ongoing
Financial Sector Technical Assistance Program (FSTAP) (Cr. 41320) and the recently closed
Enterprise Development Program (Cr. 33170), and will focus on promoting business
development services and access to finance for SMEs and on improving the business
environment. The program will build on IFC’s programs for SMEs, especially in t h e area o f
promoting access to finance through innovative products and risk-sharing mechanisms, and
expanding business opportunities for SMEs through linkages with mega-projects. The
program will target key sectors and will focus on broadening support beyond the Maputo
area. Finally, the program will support Government’s efforts at reform o f the business
environment, as outlined in the GoM Strategy for Improving the Investment Climate.
Mozambique will also seek to j o i n the Regional Trade Facilitation Program, which promotes
private sector development and trade by providing political and commercial risk instruments.
The IMF and IDA have been advising Government on improving its fiscal regime for mineral
resource and petroleum projects, and on financing o f mega-projects, especially for hydropower. The World Bank Group has been supporting, and will continue to offer support for,
such projects to enhance the benefits for the host country and ensure adherence to high
environmental and social standards. A technical assistance operation (potentially regional)
will support the provision o f high quality advisory services and capacity building in the main
ministries involved with infrastructure (e. g., Energy, Mineral Resources, Transport and
Communications, Public Works and Tourism).
-31 -

Communications sector support will be provided through a follow-on Communications
project and the Regional Communications Infrastructure Program. T h i s regional program
supports populations and businesses across eastern and southern Africa to have access to
quality and affordable telecommunications services. The follow-on Communications project
will continue to support increasing teledensity, increasing sustainable rural access to ICTbased services, especially internet services, and increasing the number o f central, provincial
and local government institutions connected to the e-Government network.

The recently restructured Energy Reform and Access Project aims to expand access to energy
for households and rural institutions (such as schools and clinics), and reform the institutional
and regulatory framework for the energy sector. The FY07 regional Malawi-Mozambique
Interconnector Project (Southern Africa Power Pool APL2) will expand energy trading
opportunities for both Mozambique and Malawi with SAPP member countries. Two followon energy projects will focus on energy generation transmission and distribution for both
domestic and industrial use, as well as continuing support for sector reform and overall
improved quality o f service. IDA will also work with IFC to address the energy needs o f the
mega-projects, including those connected with the Moatize coal project. IDA will also
collaborate with IFC to address the energy needs o f the mega-projects, e.g., through Partial
Risk Guarantees.
0

In addition, IFC i s ready to consider investments in the Beira railway and Beira and Nacala
ports that are part o f the ongoing IDA Beira Railway (Cr. 39910) and Railway and Ports
Restructuring (Cr. 32880) projects. IDA and MIGA will continue to offer political risk
guarantees that support private investments across multiple sectors. Increasingly, IDA, IFC
and MIGA will work more closely together, and at an early stage, on large infrastructure
projects in order to help optimize their developmental impacts. IDA will also review
accessing carbon financing funds. Output-Based Aid will also be accessed for additional

financing. Finally, IDA will collaborate with GEF to update irrigation infrastructure and
improve efficient water resources management in rural areas and Maputo.

IDA’Ssuccessful leadership o f interventions in the roads sector date back to the early 1990s.
The recently closed Roads and Bridges APL 1 (Cr. 35500) helped reform the institutional
and regulatory framework for the sector as well as rehabilitate the road network. The FY07
follow-on APL 2 project will continue to support the sector strategy through the development
o f a SWAP and continue to rehabilitate and maintain more o f the road network. APL 3 is
planned for the end o f the CPS period and will continue to support the sector strategy.
Support to two major regional transport corridor opportunities (Nacala and Mtwara) will also
be considered. Development o f the former would likely involve Mozambique, Malawi and
Zambia, and the latter, Mozambique, Tanzania, Malawi and possibly Zambia.

The existing Market-led Smallholder Development in the Zambezi Valley Project (Cr.
41980) and subsequent two follow-on rural development operations will support the
construction and rehabilitation o f irrigation systems and the establishment o f efficient
irrigation management, increasing the number of farming households assisted by extension
services, and developing the capacity o f f h e r and community organizations,
The tourism outcome i s supported by the current Transfrontier Conservation Area and
Tourism Development Project (Cr. 41300,56038) which aims to improve tourism capacity in
selected conservation areas. In addition, IFC will implement the Mozambique Tourism

- 32 -

Anchor Investment Program, a collaborative initiative with the Ministry o f Tourism that aims
to identify, develop and promote three “Anchor Investment Sites” in different zones for the
development o f quality tourism, as well as to mobilize funds for infrastructure development
and to create a positive image o f Mozambique as a tourism and investment destination. IFC
will work with IDA to identify critical connections to support the expansion o f tourism, and
to promote private sector investment. MIGA will support infrastructure development projects
and SMEs with its guarantee products and Small Investor Program.

The regional FY07 GEF-funded Western Indian Ocean Marine Highway Development and
Marine Contamination Prevention Project will increase the safety and efficiency of
navigation in the Western Indian Ocean by establishing a marine highway to guide ships
around environmentally sensitive areas and through selected busy sea lanes, and b y
supporting development o f capacity for port safety monitoring.

The World Bank Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery Multi-Donor Trust
Fund will support the development of: early warning and emergency preparedness systems; a
multi-sector, multi-stakeholder process to mainstream risk reduction and disaster
management; an investment framework for hazard prevention, mitigation, and preparedness;
and an ex-ante disaster recovery financing mechanism.
89.
Several cross-country integration opportunities are under consideration, including: the
FY07 regional Malawi-Mozambique Interconnector Project (Southern Africa Power Pool APL2),
Western Indian Ocean Marine Highway Development and Marine Contamination Prevention
Project, the Regional Communications Infrastructure Program, the Regional Trade Facilitation
a regional
Project, the Regional Health Worker Training Program (discussed in Pillar II),
HIV/AIDS project (discussed in Pillar II)and
, one or both o f two major transport corridor
opportunities (Nacala and Mtwara). Regional integration projects reflect intense and often
difficult multi-country coordination. While their potential benefits are tremendous, the
transaction costs are high. Thus, the Bank Group will need to be selective in supporting such
initiatives; strong ownership by all relevant countries will need to be a critical criterion.

90.
Analytical and advisory activities under this pillar will seek to deepen our understanding
o f the sources o f sustainable and shared growth and the determinants o f poverty, as well as the
development o f policies to enhance productivity and competitiveness. Our AAA work will
include a Country Economic Memorandum that analyzes constraints to economic growth and
poverty reduction and an integrated country poverty, social and gender assessment. This will be
complemented by an update o f the Investment Climate Assessment, an analysis o f labor markets,
and further analysis o f rural poverty dynamics. The status o f the financial sector, and the
measures to improve long-term finance and access to finance for SMEs in rural areas, will be the
focus o f additional AAA. A second Financial Sector Assessment Program will also be
conducted, jointly with the IMF. To better understand the costs o f building and maintaining
infrastructure in rural and urban areas, as well as to gain a better appreciation o f regional
transport opportunities, a baseline study on the fiscal cost o f infrastructure will be conducted;
this will be part o f the African regional flagship study for the Bank. Analysis will also continue
on the management and exploitation o f natural resources, both to maximize the long-term fiscal
benefits for Mozambique but also to ensure environmentally sustainable resource use. This will
include support for the preparation o f a national water resource strategy. Finally, we will support

-33-

the 2007 census and the 2008/09 national household expenditure survey, which will provide
insights on poverty, as well as inform the preparation o f Government’s next five yeai plan.
91.
Cross-Cutting Themes. Reflecting the three cross-cutting themes, all World Bank Group
explore and support applicable HIVIAIDS interventions; (ii)
operations will systematically: (i)
promote the participation of the private sector; and (iii)
tackle relevant capacity and institutionbuilding aspects, including in collaboration with other development partners. Capacity building
at the local level will be prioritized to maximize support to Government’s decentralization
agenda. The World Bank Group will work with development partners and Government to
establish an overall framework to guide interventions in each cross-cutting theme. The integrated
frameworks would exploit synergies and comparative advantages o f each development partner,
help advance harmonization, and increase the efficiency and effectiveness o f interventions in
these areas. The Bank Group Africa capacity development initiative, CDMAP, and the World
Bank Institute will help facilitate the development o f a coordinated capacity development
strategy; attention will go to results measurement and monitoring capacity building initiatives.

To provide intellectual underpinning o f these cross-cutting themes and to gain a better
92.
understanding o f the constraints and opportunities for new and existing operations, Bank staff
and development partners will continue to review the implications o f Mozambique’s political
economy for the design and implementation o f operations.
Resources to Implement the Strategy
93.
The IDA allocation i s performance-based, the amount o f financing being significantly
influenced by government performance (discussed below). Assuming progress under the
performance framework relative to other IDA beneficiaries - and, importantly, an IDA15
replenishment broadly comparable to IDA14 - the annual financing available to Mozambique i s
expected to remain similar over the FY08-11 period at approximately $155 million. T h i s i s
similar to the $680 million over four years allocated under the 2003-7 CAS. (Appendix 7a lists
IDA commitments, disbursements and repayments during the FY04-07 period.) Given the results
o f the 2006 I D A A M F joint Debt Sustainability Analysis, Mozambique is expected to receive
financing in the form o f credits rather than grants,
94.
The Bank Group’s presence in Mozambique has expanded and with planned recruitments
and decentralization transfers, should be adequate to implement the program outlined in this
strategy. At end-FY07, the country office will employ 12 international staff and 28 national
staff, Sectors that have task team leader representation in the Country Office include
communications, energy, water and sanitation, agricultural and rural development, health and
HIV/AIDS, and poverty reduction and economic management. Skills in financial management
and procurement have also been reinforced, including to support Government in its public
financial management reforms. An internationally-recruited Senior Operations Officer recently
joined the office as Mozambique Country Program Manager. The IFC office in Maputo, which
was reopened in 2004, now comprises three international staff and 14 local staff, covering the
areas o f investments, technical assistance and SME finance.

R i s k s to the Strategy

95.
HIV/AIDS poses the most formidable risk to Mozambique’s development. The
devastating effects o f the HIV/AIDS epidemic threaten Mozambique’s growth potential in many
ways. I t s adverse impact on beneficiaries, the social fabric, civil service capacity and labor
productivity i s already obvious. Failure o f leadership to bring about behavioural change will
have an adverse effect on PARPA I1and CPS implementation.
96.
In addition, governance problems pose the other significant risk to the strategy.
Increasing one-party dominance poses a risk to the development o f the nascent democracy, and
may limit public accountability, citizen voice and participation.
97.
Notwithstanding the observation made in the previous paragraph, elections also pose a
risk to the implementation o f the program outlined in this partnership strategy. Elections for
provincial assemblies will be held in 2007, municipal elections in 2008, and national presidential
and parliamentary in 2009. W h i l e elections oblige a government to show results by a certain
date, they may also delay difficult decisions for second generation reforms, particularly around
the time o f national elections, as happened in 2004, the year of the last national elections.
Revenue collection as a percentage o f GDP also dropped in that year. However, both the revenue
generation and the pace o f reforms came back on track in 2005 and accelerated in 2006. The
election cycle will require both attention and a sense o f realism about the timing o f reforms.
98.
Inadequate fiduciary controls and a failure to strengthen public financial accountability
mechanisms could result in increased corruption, which would undermine government credibility
and private-sector confidence and possibly prompt development partners to withhold support.
Moreover, a lack o f transparency in the justice sector will erode investor confidence.
99.
Mozambique i s also vulnerable to exogenous shocks. Weather-related shocks, as vividly
illustrated by the 2005 drought and early 2007 floods and cyclone, are temporary in nature and
can be somewhat ameliorated with exceptional assistance. The Country Team i s also working
with the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction & Recovery Multi-Donor Trust Fund to put
emergency management systems in place. Terms-of-trade shocks are also temporary in nature
and require quick policy responses. Third, there are external private investment decisions that
have a significant macro-economic impact and can be similar to external shocks. Mega-projects
are such investments. These also require adequate policy responses.
Managing Upside and Downside Risks: Strategy Adjustments and Mitigation

100.

The risks discussed above have been streamlined in the engagement framework. Risks o f
exogenous shocks are generally understood to be beyond the direct control o f Government, and
their actual occurrence should in principle justify greater commitments o f resources from the
Bank Group in the form o f financing and advice. Risks o f HIV/AIDS, deterioration o f
governance, and policy reversals are more firmly within Government’s grasp, and justify a more
nuanced approach by the Bank Group.

-35-

101. If significant improvements or slippages occur in the core governance areas and the
quality o f service delivery does not improve, then the overall amount o f financing, the choice o f
lending instruments and the sector focus will need to be adjusted.
102. The financing envelope will be strictly guided by the notional allocation under the PBA
framework. Improving Country Performance and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) indicators,
especially governance-related indicators, will help Government access more IDA financing.
Likewise, improved project implementation performance could also increase IDA allocations.
103. T h e increasing level o f financing through programmatic budget support (the PRSC
series) i s a direct consequence of the Bank Group’s trust in Mozambique’s own country systems.
If the monitoring o f the use o f resources improves, and shows that they were used as intended,
the Bank Group will show a willingness to expand i t s PRSC envelope. If current issues with
public financial management are not addressed rapidly, and since donor dependency i s a
governance issue in itself, the Bank Group will consider downsizing its PRSC support.
However, the Bank Group will not discount the momentum that was developed in its policy
dialogue from its decision to move to programmatic budget support, and will adjust its program
after consulting with the G18 partners, and in a manner consistent with the Paris Declaration:
104, The sector focus of the programs supported by the PRSC series, as well as the investment
project portfolio will need to be reconsidered depending on the pace o f progress in various areas
o f the policy dialogue and improvements in country systems. Regarding the various
development policies that the Bank supports, the Bank i s committed to a sustained financial and
advisory engagement if the challenges remain and the authorities continue to request its
involvement. The PRSC series and accompanying updates will provide the opportunity for such
stock-takings and adjustments. If little progress i s made in addressing fundamental governance
issues, the Bank will assign more resources (financial and advisory) to address them - resources
that will necessarily be drawn from the limited envelope defined by the PBA. The Bank will
increase its support to the GoM’s governance agenda through targeted financial and technical
engagement, and our portfolio management. Recurrent portfolio problems such as counterpart
funding, financial management, procurement, Government ownership o f projects, and M&E will
be more insistently addressed. To allow for this contingency, operations under preparation will
identify objectives and components that can be deferred without jeopardizing the primary
objectives and components. Sustainability o f the outcomes o f scaled-down operations will be
key, so as to be leveraged by subsequent operations that will pick up components that will not
have been implemented as originally contemplated. In deciding which development policy
dialogue to cut back, the Bank Group will pay attention to the risk o f irreversible damage to
development prospects from its disengagement, and the public good nature o f some policy areas.
105. To mitigate this risk, the Bank Group i s working closely with Government and other
development partners to improve the fiduciary and legal framework through: the PRSC series,
analytical work, support to public sector reform, and extensive capacity-building at national and
sub-national levels o f government.
106. The Bank Group will also address fiduciary risks in its own projects through smarter
design o f projects that will incorporate more stringent fiduciary safeguards. Local accountability
-36-

I

mechanisms such as citizen scorecards and sector governance and accountability frameworks
will be mainstreamed across projects. The Bank Group will also provide capacity building
support to project staff and counterparts in financial management and procurement, especially at
the district level. Procurement and financial management reviews will be conducted for the
portfolio during the CPPR process. Recurrent issues such as counterpart funding and VAT
refunds will be more insistently addressed. Projects in problem status for more than six months
will be considered for restructuring and other remedial measures; those in problem status for one
year may be closed to limit portfolio risk.
Conclusion

107. The Bank Group i s looking forward to collaborating with the Government o f
Mozambique and development partners to implement the above strategy during the next four
years. While adhering to the principles o f engagement defined above (focus, collaborate,
deliver), t h e Bank Group will remain flexible and responsive to Government’s needs in order to
implement PARPA I1efficiently and effectively, and in order to address unforeseen scenarios. At
the same time, the Bank Group will work with Government and development partners to help
develop and implement a long-term strategic vision for Mozambique that builds on the country’s
comparative advantages and which in tightly anchored in accelerating shared growth that will
benefit all Mozambicans.

CPS Consultations - Conversations with Government, Civil Society, and the
Private Sector

During the CPS planning process, the World Bank Group consulted with Government, development partners, civil
society, the private sector and local governments.
Government leaders and 18 other development partners were consulted during a series o f meetings in October,
2006 (called CS-19 for Country Strategy 19 Partners) that allowed Government and development partners to
comment on each other’s strategy and to ensure synergies and gaps are addressed in plans to support PARPA 11.
Civil society organizations, private sector and local government representatives were consulted during December,
2006 in three locations (Beira in the north, Nampula in the center, and Maputo in the south). The main objectives
o f these consultation sessions were to collect participants’ perceptions on: (a) the areas o f intervention to be
included in the new strategy; and (b) the suitability o f the geographical approach for the implementation o f the
strategy.
The most frequently selected areas for WBG intervention include: Agriculture, Governance, Infrastructure,
W / A I D S , Health, Education, Water and Sanitation, Private Sector and Tourism.

b

The most frequently requested interventions, which did not differ significantly by sub-region, include:
e
Agriculture -Trade (Rural and Provincial Level); Installation o f Irrigation Systems; Credit and Micro credit
for Agriculture; Agro-processing; Technical Assistance to Farmers; Trade o f Agricultural Inputs;
Reforestation; and Technical Assistance to Cattle Sector.
e
Governance - Capacity Buildingo f District Governments, Municipalities and Community Organizations;
Support the Public Sector Reform; Support the Strengthening o f the Judicial System; Support the
Strengthening o f Accountability Mechanisms; Support the Fight against Corruption; Promotion o f
participation o f both Civil Society Organizations and Communities.
e
Infrastructure - Reconstruction and Maintenance o f Roads and Bridges (Municipal, Tertiary and Local);
Development o f Ports and Railways; Expansion o f EnergyElectricity and Telecommunications Networks;
Urban Planning with the utilization o f Geographical Information Systems; and Monitoring o f Infrastructure
Projects.
e
H W / A I D S - Prevention and Fight against HIV/AIDS; Free Access t o ARV treatment, complemented with
food distribution.
e Health - Training o f Health Professionals; Expansion and Capacity Building o f Health Clinics Network;
Prevention and Fight against other relevant epidemic diseases (Malaria, TB, Leprosy, etc.); Environment
Sanitation.
e Education - Expansion o f the School Network; Training o f Teachers (including psycho-pedagogical
aspects); and Functional Literacy.
e
Water and Sanitation- Construction o f Water Infrastructures (small systems, dams, small dams, water
points).
e
Private Sector - Promotion o f Enirepreneurship and Technical Assistance to S M E s (including small
businesses incubators, warranty funds, credit, WET, technological innovation$); Technical Assistance
Projects to Private Sector; Credit Programs to Private Sector with l o w interest rates.
e
Tourism - Credit Programs for the development o f the Tourism Sector (lodges, hotels, transport, etc.);
Training in Tourism Sector; Fauna Repopulation.
Participants in general preferred that the World Bank Group focus a whole suite o f projects in selected localized
geographical areas rather than implement national projects. However, they could not agree on which geographical
sub-regions should be selected.

Introduction

1.
This CAS Completion Report (CASCR) assesses the effectiveness o f the FY04-07 World
Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy for Mozambique (Report No. 26747-MOZ, dated
October 20, 2003). It i s based on reviews of: (a) portfolio implementation performance reports;
(b) the last two Implementation Status and Results Reports (ISRs) and Aide-Memoires o f each
project active during the CAS period; (c) Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs) o f projects
completed during the CAS period, Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) Reviews o f ICRs, and
Quality Assurance Group (QAG) Reviews, where available; (d) interviews with selected client
counterparts; and, (e) self-assessments by the Country Team. The findings from this assessment
have informed the preparation o f the 2007-11 (FY08-11) Country Partnership Strategy.
2.
The FY04-07 Mozambique CAS was one o f the first results-based CASs to be developed
in the Bank. I t specified the CAS outcomes that would support Government’s long-term
development goals, as well as targets, milestones (intermediate indicators), and indicators used to
measure’ the outcomes. As such, the task o f assessing the achievement o f results i s relatively
straightforward given the availability o f reliable data.
11.

Government’s Strategic Goals (PARPA 2001-2005 and PARPA I 1 2006-2009)

3.
The CAS used as i t s basis Government o f Mozambique’s strategic goals as articulated in
the first PRSP (called PARPA for its Portuguese acronym: Action Plan for the Reduction o f
Poverty) drafted for the 2001-2005 period and approved by the Council o f Ministers in April
2001. These strategic goals were grouped under three pillars: Improving the Investment Climate,
Expanding Service Delivery, and Building Capacity and Accountability.

4.
The first pillar, Improving the Investment Climate, emphasized growth through greater
private sector investment, improving access to financial services, lowering business transaction
costs, and improving infrastructure to enhance connectivity to markets and to increase access to
energy, promoting sustainable utilization and conservation o f natural resources, and increasing
agricultural productivity. The second pillar, Expanding Service Delivery, focused on reducing
the incidence o f HIV/AIDS, reducing child and maternal mortality, increasing access to safe
water and sanitation, increasing primary enrollment and completion rates, and eliminating gender
and regional disparity in education. Promoting efficiency and efficacy in the delivery o f public
services was also a major objective in this pillar. The third pillar, Building Capacity and
Accountability, emphasized sound macroeconomic management, with low inflation, stable
exchange rates, and increased tax revenues, financial and budget management reforms, civil
service reforms, and combating corruption.

111.

Bank Strategic Objectives and CAS Outcomes (FYO4-07)

5.
The FY04-07 Mozambique CAS i s well aligned with Government’s strategic goals. It
includes a clear results framework with measurable indicators to guide program planning,
country performance monitoring, and portfolio performance monitoring. Attachment 1 compares
the original 2003 objectives to the 2006 retrofitted objectives. The original CAS results
framework contained 14 CAS objectives aligned to 36 outcome indicators and 54 intermediate
indicators. In early 2006, with indicators finalized for the Performance Assessment Framework,
the CAS Results Framework was retrofitted to align better with the P A F indicators and the
indicators o f the Africa Action Plan, which had then been developed by the Africa Region. Some
intermediate indicators were also reformulated to reflect the actual progress o f the portfolio. This
retrofitted results framework i s included in the CAS Progress Report. The reformulation did not
change the development objectives nor the substance o f most indicators. However, for some
outcomes, there was confusion between CAS outcomes and national outcomes. Some indicators
included in the results framework did not match CAS goals but rather reflected Government’s
national goals. This normally occurred where there was not careful distinguishing between PAF
indicators and CAS indicators.
IV.

Results Assessment

6.
Attachment 2 provides a detailed analysis o f CAS progress and World Bank Group
performance against the 2006 retrofitted results framework. This section summaries these
findings by CAS pillar and outcome.
Improvingthe Investment Climate (Pillar I)
Outcome: Improved business environment for private sector

7.
Business environment. Mozambique i s still one o f the most difficult places in the world to
do business. The country’s rank for Ease o f Doing Business has slipped from 137 in 2005 to 140
in the 2006. The country has not met its 2006 targets for reducing the cost and time required for
registering a business, although these indicators are expected to improve significantly in 2007 as
a result o f computerization and electronic publishing o f two o f the most time-consuming steps in
the process (the publishing articles in the official gazette and applying for an operational
license). More problematic i s the country’s inability to meet reform targets regarding the labor
law. Mozambique has one o f the most rigid labor markets in the world, and the most rigid in
southern Africa. The new Labor Law approved by Cabinet in November 200625starts the reform
process but falls short o f the changes necessary to meet Government’s target o f ranking 80* in
the world for labor rigidity.26
8.
The WBG has contributed to progress in improving the business environment through:
the PRSC series and the Enterpkse Reform Project (Cr. 33 170); key AAA including the CEM,
the investment climate assessment, and Doing Business surveys; participation in sector dialogue;
and TA in tax policy reform for the mineral resources sector. Although Government did not meet

Not yet submitted to Parliament.
As measured by the Doing Business Report.

- 53 -

.

PAF targets for reducing administrative barriers and for improving labor competitiveness, Bank
Group performance has been satisfactory in pushing for reform.
9.
The Mineral Resources Management Capacity Building Project (Cr. 34860) has been
providing technical assistance to GoM for institutional development and regulatory reform
designed to encourage the expansion o f private investment in mining in a socially and
environmentally sound way. Implementation has been satisfactory. However, the outcomes o f
this project were not included in the CAS results framework.
Outcome: Regulation and supervision o f financial system reinforced

10.
Financial sector. A high level o f government sponsorship and coordination o f financial
sector reforms has led to good progress on implementation o f reforms in the sector. IDA support
i s through the multi-donor Financial Sector Technical Assistance Project (FSTAP, Cr. 41320),
the PRSC series, and through leading the PAF working group. Technical assistance is provided
by the IMF. The Financial Sector Assessment, supported by IDA, the IMF and other donors was
also key in preventing further financial crises during and following the liquidity crisis o f the two
national banks in 2000. FSTAP became effective in March 2006 and implementation i s on track
despite slow start-up. The project’s M&E framework needs strengthening. The project enjoys
good donor collaboration which i s partly exemplified injoint missions. An attempt at setting up a
common fund failed, in part possibly due to ADB and WBG internal fiduciary policies.
11.
Private sector support. A key development objective o f IDA’S Enterprise Development
Project (Cr. 33170) and o f IFC’s program, i s to increase access to finance and support for SMEs,
yet outcomes related to SME finance and support have not been included in the original or
retrofitted CAS results framework, Bank Group performance in supporting SMEs could be
improved and scaled up. The Enterprise Development Project, which closed in June 2006,
reported better than expected outputs at project closing, especially in the areas o f linkages and
promoting business advisory and training services for SMEs. However, weaknesses in M&E
prevented systematic reporting on actual results and impact for beneficiary SMEs although there
i s anecdotal evidence to this effect. Supervision for this project was not vigilant, as financial
management and internal control irregularities which escalated in the final 18 months o f the
project were not flagged to Management until near project closing. The project provided a
platform for collaboration and joint experience with development partners; however, feedback
provided to the I C R team indicates IDA could have involved the development partners more in
the implementation and supervision process. Support to SMEs provided by the Bank Group has
also come at high unit cost; the support model should be reexamined. Closer collaboration
between IFC and IDA in sharing knowledge and resources, as planned since 2007, will partially
help address this issue. The Bank Group i s developing an appropriate strategy to respond to
Government’s request for strengthened support in private sector development.
Outcome: Improved delivery o f infrastructureservices

12.
Only one out o f four infrastructure goals has been met during the CAS period. The
telecommunications target has been exceeded while the targets for roads, transport, and energy
have only been partially met.

- 54 -

13.
Communications. Teledensity has far exceeded the CAS target o f 1.6 percent with
teledensity actually increasing to nearly nine percent in 2006. This result reflects, inter alia, the
Bank’s solid performance in supporting the communications sector reform agenda, including a
well-designed and supervised Communications Sector Reform Project (Cr. 35770) (albeit, with
some delays in project implementation).
14.
Transport. While restructuring in the roads sector follows industry best practice (e.g.,
through a Road Fund, private sector participation, road safety) and has led to collection o f
revenues above target, non-performance o f provincial works departments and procurement
delays have led to high cost increases and to both the road rehabilitation and road maintenance
targets not being met. Maintenance execution and contract management need improvement. The
Roads and Bridges APL 1 project (Cr. 35500) achieved the upgrading and rehabilitation o f 800
kilometers o f road as against the targeted 1250 kilometers. Road maintenance i s 11,949 W y r
(as of June 2006) against the target o f 14,000 W y r by Dec 2006. Institutional reform targets
have been achieved. The rural access indicator was included in the retrofitted CAS results
framework even though IDA support to this outcome would not begin during the CAS period.
15.
IDA provided advice through the Roads and Bridges APL 1 project that led to sector
restructuring that follows industry best practice. Although limited provincial capacity explains
much o f the delay in meeting project targets, part o f the cost increases are attributed to IDA
project design flaws associated with exchange rate risk. Other cost increases are attributed to
government delays in processing IVA refunds, causing contractors to increase their costs.
Another lesson learned from this project, which has been incorporated into the follow-on APL, i s
to enhance sustainability by developing the capacity o f government staff rather than hiring
consultants to do much o f the work. The project required extensions totaling 24 months.
16.
Original CAS targets for international rail traffic, transport time and cost, cannot be met
and were eliminated from the retrofitted CAS. T h i s poorer than expected performance i s
attributed to several factors, including weak private sector interest in rail and port concessions,
poor performance o f existing concessions, poor government monitoring o f concessions, slow
implementation o f the Railway and Ports Restructuring Project (Cr. 32880) which has led to cost
overruns, and the deteriorating economic situation in Zimbabwe. The restructuring o f the
government parastatal, CFM, however, has been proceeding as planned. IDA support through the
Railway and Port Restructuring Project has been responsive and in accordance with sector
policy, although the design o f the project i s complex and ambitious. The closing date has been
extended by a total o f 30 months, attributed to slow G o M response and procurement delays.
Energy. The target for 2006 o f new connections for 30,000 households and 3000 clinics
17.
and schools will not be met due to Government’s change in sector reform approach just as the
IDA-supported Energy Reform and Access Project (Cr. 38190, 52650) became effective.
Government i s no longer supporting the privatization o f the parastatal EdM but instead i s putting
regulatory mechanisms in place to monitor improvements in commercial and technical
performance at EdM. IDA did not incorporate political economy considerations into the design
o f the Energy Reform and Access Project; IDA approved a risky privatization strategy just
before elections without ensuring the commitment o f the new Government. As a result, the
project was approved in August 2003, became effective in March 2004 (the elections were in
December 2004)’ and has been in problem status since. However, a new Senior Energy

- 55 -

Specialist based in the Country Office has been working closely with Government to restructure
the project along new Bank sector policy and advice. The WBG i s also advising Government on
financing options for the Cahora Bassa hydroelectric facility.
Outcome: Sustainable management of natural resources

18.
The CAS outcome o f sustainable management o f natural resources has been partially
met. A small portion o f rural land i s covered by management plans, though these are mostly
forest concessions. Community level natural resource management planning has been improving
slowly; capacity to implement management plans at all levels remains low. The primary Bank
Group operation in this area has been the IDA and GEF-sponsored Coastal and Marine
Biodiversity Management Project (IDA-33660, 3366A GEF- 23844). This project has been in
long-term problem status and i s currently set to close in June 2007; despite a 24 month
extension, a restructuring and recent improvement in implementation, the key development
objectives have not been met (although the Strategic Development Plan for establishing
conservation areas will have been prepared and endorsed by MICOA). The project team i s
working with Government to address sustainability issues. These include applying lessons
learned from pilot projects; assuring the implementation o f systems; funding and staffing for the
Research Center; and implementation o f the Strategic Development Plan. Quality-at-entry issues
lack o f assurance o f government ownership, capacity, and readiness at effectiveness were
the source o f the project’s long-term problem status. Counterpart funds and financial
management have been recurrent flags. Bank Group AAA that contributed to progress in
conservation and tourism include the Country Environmental Assessment and a joint EU-WB
analysis o f MICOA’s performance. IDA and GEF approved the Transfrontier Conservation
Areas and Tourism Project (IDA-41300, 56038) which became effective in June 2006. The
objectives o f the project support the CAS outcome although the project outcomes and indicators
have not been included in the CAS results framework.

Outcome: Increased use o f new farm technologies

19.
The CAS targets related to the use o f new farm technologies have been met (although the
sector has met only two out o f the four targets that PAF partners track). Government has
demonstrated commitment to improving extension services including decentralizing the
management o f these services. However, some major donors have pulled away f i o m sector
support (DFID, Netherlands, Italy, USAID, IDA) due to poor performance o f the first SWAP
(PROAGRI I).
Poor policy and planning, budget execution and data quality continue to be major
sector issues. IDA interventions in the agriculture sector include participation in the sector
working group; extensive TA and supervision for the implementation o f two extension
outsourcing pilots; ESW to evaluate the effectiveness o f public extension services; supporting
the first sector SWAP (PROAGRI I,Cr. 31710) and approval o f the Market-led Smallholder
Agriculture Development in the Zambezi Valley Project during FY06 (Cr. 41980). IDA will not
support the second phase o f the sector SWAP due to poor performance o f the first SWAP. IDA
has been responsive in supervision and has provided extensive technical assistance as
government sector capacity i s major impediment to progress.

20.
Overall, the World Bank Group’s performance in Pillar I was moderately satisfactory.
Quality at entry and implementation support provided to projects in the financial sector,
communications, transport, and agriculture were satisfactory. Implementation support for private

- 56 -

sector development was not sufficiently vigilant and therefore missed critical financial
management and procurement irregularities. Management was also not notified in a timely
manner to take corrective action. Technical advice and policy support also did not meet client
expectations. The design o f the Coastal and Marine Biodiversity Management project was overly
complex, especially for counterparts at the local level, subjecting the project to long-term
problem status, even after a restructuring which also contained design flaws. IDA did not ensure
client commitment for the energy project which also lead to the project being in long-term
problem status. Political economy considerations were not adequately accounted for in the
design o f this project.

Expanding Service Delivery (Pillar 11)
Outcome: Reduced H I V vertical transmission from mother to child
2 1.
The national response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic continues to accelerate but i s s t i l l not
commensurate with the need. Government i s making strong efforts to broaden its geographical
coverage. IDA has provided support through the (MAP) HIV/AIDS Response project (Grant
No. H0300), the regional HIVIAIDS Treatment Acceleration Project (Grant No. H1040), and
policy dialogue with Government in collaboration with other donors through the Partners Forum.
IDA support has been instrumental to Government’s expansion o f i t s HIV/AIDS control
program. The M A P HIV/AIDS Response Project provides 60 percent o f total financing for
HIV/AIDS. The project was a problem project from May 2004 until February 2007 due to poor
government capacity and coordination, and inadequate Bank supervision. Additional support by
IDA since the Mid-Term Review in February 2006 (when it was transferred to the Health sector
for supervision) has resulted in improved performance. The Bank has decided to channel i t s
funds with other donors through a Common Fund, which will reduce transaction costs for
Government; however, there have been significant delays in processing the legal amendment
needed to that effect.

22.

The regional HIV/AIDS Treatment Acceleration Project received an Unsatisfactory
overall rating during QAG’s seventh Quality at Entry Assessment for i t s flawed design because it
was not apparent how the Bank would have received clear answers to key questions on clinical
effectiveness, impact on health systems, and fiscal sustainability. Since then the Bank team has
elaborated a specific learning agenda to address these questions. This project has provided
essential funding for Mozambique’s treatment needs. It provides funding through three NGOs
whose patients represent about 30% o f total patients treated in Mozambique.

Outcome: Improved coverage of health services
23.
All CAS targets with respect to health service coverage have been met. The budget for
health i s increasing in absolute terms, and more i s going to the provinces and in a more equitable
way, in line with the recommendations o f IDA and development partner analytical work and
policy dialogue. IDA provided no lending support to health services during the CAS period
(other than for HIV/AIDS). Indicators listed are for PAF partners. IDA’Srecent analytical work,
“Better Health Spending to Reach the MDGs” has been instrumental in influencing the
government health service delivery strategy. IDA has pressed Government to use an integrated
service delivery approach including the development o f outreach services and community health
services, in addition to facility-based services, which have been the main focus o f government

- 57 -

efforts. IDA has also urged Government to focus on less-served rural areas. A new Health
Services Delivery Program SWAP i s currently under preparation in response to Government’s
request.

Outcome: Sustainable increases in access to safe water

24.
A national indicator o f access to safe water was included in the CAS results framework
even though the CAS program only intervened in five cities. Access has increased only
marginally overall (current overall access is 40.2%) but i s expected to increase significantly in
the five cities o f the IDA project. Reliability o f water supplies has improved significantly over
the last 18 months. The number o f connections is expected to increase by an average 34 percent
(to about 122,000) in the next 12 months in the IDA-project cities. There is potential to serve
over 2.4 million with improvements in water production made under the project.
25.
IDA’Sinterventions have included the National Water IProject (Cr. 30390) which closed
in June 2005 and the current National Water I1 Project (Cr. 32470, 32471). National Water I
achieved significant results, including strengthening o f sector institutions, privatization o f water

management for five cities, and the successful piloting o f the demand-driven approach for rural
water provision. Nonetheless, Government and development partners, including IDA, did not
collaborate to ensure scaling up o f this best-practice model after the IDA project closed. Qualityat-entry issues contributed to significant start-up delays. The current National Water I1Project i s
expected to dramatically increase coverage and reliability o f water service in the five project
towns. Implementation progress has been satisfactory despite slow start up and disbursement,
leading to an extension o f 24 months.

Outcome: Increased access and quality o f primary education system, and improved quality
o f higher education

26.
In the CAS period, IDA financed the Education Sector Strategy Program (1999 - 2006,
Cr. 31720), the Higher Education Project (2002-2007, Cr. 36090), and the Technical and
Vocational Education and Training Project (2006-2010, Cr. 41560). In the area o f basic
education, ESSP was instrumental not only in providing additional financing for basic education,
but also for capacity building and contributing to the alignment and harmonization o f donors.
There has been significant progress in expanding access to all levels o f education, especially at
the EP1 level. ESSP met project targets for gross enrollment, but data quality issues make the
achievement o f targets for passing examinations and for repetition questionable. Primary
completion rate remains l o w at less than 50%, posing a serious risk to the achievement o f the
relevant MDG by 2015. Quality o f education remains an issue. ESSP outcomes and indicators
were not included in the CAS results framework.
27.
IDA was the first donor to support the ESSP. However, there was no agreement among
donors on the procurement and financial instruments critical for IDA financing and no legal
framework for ensuring donor funding, and this resulted in failure to establish a common fund or
SWAP arrangement. This short-coming caused donor funding issues, which contributed to startup delays and a complex project design, making it difficult for IDA and Government to assess
the performance o f the project during implementation. The less than satisfactory implementation
performance o f the project during its early years indicates that the preparation team did not
sufficiently take into account the limited readiness o f project authorities to implement this

- 58 -

program. Project implementation was rated unsatisfactory from the end o f 2000 to 2002. After
the project was realigned to focus on components that required additional financing, project
implementation was rated satisfactory. The closing date o f the project was extended by 24
months.

'

28.
T h e Higher Education Project has achieved the targets for three o f four key performance
indicators, including the internal efficiency rates, annual number o f graduates, and the
introduction o f new degree programs. The fourth indicator, increase by 5 percentage points the
number o f students from the North and Center, was only partially achieved. The proportion o f
students from the Center reached only 27% in 2004, short o f the target which was 35%.
Expansion at secondary level has not been commensurate with that at the primary level.
Secondary gross enrollment ratio i s only 16%, a serious bottleneck in the education system. The
government further made progress in the policy front by approving the ESSP 11, TVET reform
program, and the second phase o f Higher Education Operational Plan. The implementation o f
the Higher Education Project i s on track with a slight delay. The design o f the project has raised
sustainability concerns as much o f the higher education directorate remains staffed by
consultants hired under the IDA credit. The Technical and Vocational Education and Training
Project only recently became effective (June 2006) and its outcomes are not part o f the results
framework.
Outcome: Improved public service delivery planning, budgeting, and financial
management

29.
Transparency o f public procurement practices that reinforced IDA interventions in this
area include budget support through the PRSC series, the Public Sector Reform Project (Grant
No. H0240), the Decentralized Planning and Finance Project (Grant No. H0670), and the
Municipal Development Project (Cr. 35490). Deconcentration o f functions and responsibilities to
districts has begun although a comprehensive decentralization approach to the major sectors
needs to be undertaken in order to ensure effective allocations o f functions, finances and human
resources for local service delivery. Criteria were defined and adopted for distribution in the
2007 Local Initiative Investment Budget (OIIL) and the proportion o f investment budget to be
executed by district governments has increased. Work on the inter-governmental fiscal
framework has therefore made progress but it s t i l l needs further effort to establish a predictable,
stable and equitable system and to provide specific guidelines for execution responsibilities. The
framework needs to be developed for all subnational entities including provinces, districts and
municipalities. Work on the National Decentralization Policy i s under way but does not as yet set
out specific strategies or targets. The Municipal Development Project demonstrated that there i s
significant work needed to increase the fiscal autonomy and institutional capacity o f
municipalities to be able to finance and implement service delivery. IDA i s working with
partners on preparing a National Decentralised Planning and Finance Programme (PPFD) to
complement the budget allocations to districts as well as a multi-donor and government
supported AAA on municipal development.

30.
The Municipal Development project was in long-term problem status until the last year o f
the project. The design o f this project was also overly-ambitious especially considering the
capacity o f municipalities. Moreover, ownership was also a problem again reflecting inadequate
incorporation o f political economy factors. Disbursement on the Decentralized Finance and

- 59 -

Planning Project has been slightly slower than planned. However, the project supported
significant progress on policy reform and capacity development through learning by doing at the
local level. Major policy steps have been taken including the Law on Local Organs o f State (and
i t s associated regulations) which were approved in 2004 and are under implementation. These
make the districts a budget entity and require consultative council approval. Plans have been
prepared for most districts (the PAF indicator i s for all districts supported by donors, not only
IDA) although the quality i s poor in many cases. The first district audits were also conducted and
the Tribunal Administrativo ’s institutional assessment and Corporate Plan were funded under the
DPFP. Close supervision and realistic reporting by the IDA team has kept the project on track
despite a difficult political environment.
31.
Government’s slow progress in public sector reform continues to raise concern among
donors. Most targets have not been met. Inter-ministry coordination and government-wide
commitment and championship o f these reforms pose significant risk to the Public Sector
Reform Project, which was restructured in 2006 due to poor performance. One main design flaw
was the installation o f a parallel P I U that competed with ministries for control o f reforms.
Another was that complex political economy considerations were not incorporated into the
design o f the project, leading to commitment issues which impacted implementation progress
later on.
32.
The World Bank Group’s overall performance for Pillar I1 was moderately satisfactory.
While satisfactory support was provided in the education, health and water sectors and for the
DPFP project, quality-at-entry and implementation problems associated with the HIV/AIDS
projects, the ESSP program, the Municipal Development project and the Public Sector Reform
project point to the need for IDA to better learn the recurrent lessons o f over-complexity of
project design and inadequate incorporation o f political economy factors that affect client
ownership o f projects.
Building public-sector capacity and accountability (Pillar 111)
Outcome: Improved budget allocation and budget execution

33.
IDA’S main instrument for supporting financial and budget management reforms i s the
PRSC series. Reforms are mostly on track. Most targets have been met, except for one: recurrent
expenditures in priority sectors are not greater than expenditures for non-priority sectors. Own
revenues included in the budget are 70 percent higher in real terms in 2007 than in 2006.
External funds reporting in the single treasury account (CUT) have continually increased. Budget
allocation in accordance with PARPA requirements (65%). Budget execution for 2006 on track
to meet PARPA target. Implementation o f e-SISTAFE has been progressing steadily if slower
than expected. Operationalizing e-SISTAFE at the district and municipal levels is now a priority.
Although the targets for internal and external audits will be met, the capacity o f the external
auditing body, Tribunal Adrninistrativo, i s a concern as the body was allocated very little budget
for the auditing function in 2005 and received none. The creation o f the Revenue Authority
finally commenced in November 2006 after significant delays.

- 60 -

34.
IDA’S collaboration with the IMF on macroeconomic issues and with Program Aid
Partners in providing budget support within a clear policy framework (the Performance
Assessment Framework - a prioritized subset o f PARPA I1Strategic Matrix indicators) has been
instrumental in helping Government achieve steady targets in a sound policy framework.
Outcome: Stronger M&E capability in Government

35.
All CAS targets related to monitoring and evaluation have been met. IDA support i s
provided through the PRSC series, technical support, and donor harmonization activities.
Government meets with Program Aid Partners twice yearly to review progress o f implementation
o f the PES (Economic and Social Plan) and to set targets for the PARPARAF which get
incorporated in the CFMP (Country Financial Management Plan). The PAF targets are annexed
to the PES. Government has made significant progress in M&E at the national level, especially
for monitoring the PARPA I1 and aligning the PARPA I1 to budget documents. Nonetheless,
there has been very little progress at the sector level; most sectors do not have sector results
frameworks, and M&E capacity i s weak, especially at the provincial and district levels.
36.
IDA has provided M&E support to GoM and development partners for the development
o f the PARPA I1Strategic Matrix, the Performance Assessment Framework and the alignment o f
IDA projects to PARPA and PARPA I1 objectives. IDA also participated in working groups to
ensure consistency and alignment between PARPA, CFMP, PES and the OE (Budget Execution
Report).
Outcome: Reduced corruption

37.
IDA supports the corruption reduction objective mainly through the Public Sector
Reform Project and policy support through the PRSC series, although all projects have fiduciary
safeguards in place to fight corruption at the project level. The main anti-corruption target
relating to the number o f cases prosecuted, has not been met: the High Authority for Combat o f
Corruption did not prosecute any cases in 2005. In 2006, however, more action has been taken
resulting in 194 public officers expelled, 164 dismissed and 73 penalized; 249 other cases are
due to be concluded, including one concerning the Director o f Prisons. The 2007 Doing Business
Report ranked Mozambique 93rd out o f 146 countries for corruption. The 2004 W B I Anticorruption Survey indicated that Mozambique performs worse than average for countries in
southern Afiica with respect to control o f corruption, though better on accountability, political
stability and other areas o f governance. The Action Plan for Government’s Anti-Corruption
Strategy was finalized in March 2007; apart from this and some high-level events and meetings,
implementation o f the Strategy i s about to start..
38.
At the request o f Government, W B I provided comprehensive assistance in developing
and conducting both the Anti-corruption Survey and the subsequent Anti-corruption Strategy.
However, despite continuous delays in implementing the Anti-corruption Strategy, IDA did not
use triggers in the PRSC to ensure Government delivers in a timely manner the results in the
Anti-corruption Strategy, especially in the prosecution o f cases.

-61 -

Outcome: Increased efficiency in the provision o f services by the justice system

39.
IDA’s support for the justice sector has mainly been through the PRSC series plus the
Public Sector Reform Project. The specific outcomes associated with this project are not
included in the CAS results framework. Instead, the results framework includes sector indicators.
In the Joint Review 2006, two o f the five indicators were considered to have been met, one
partially met and the other not met (see Attachment 2). Poor quality o f dialogue and progress in
the justice sector poses a serious concern for development partners. Discrepancies in priorities,
content, and relevance o f indicators are an issue.
40.
Direct IDA involvement in the justice sector started in late 2006 through a $5 million
component in the restructured Public Sector Reform Project. Though small, this component i s
expected to achieve modest impact on critical activities, including: (i)build capacity and
strengthen institutions at the provinciallappellate jurisdictions level; (ii)raise awareness o f
citizens’ rights and responsibilities through working with civil society; (iii)
improve access to
courts, conflict resolution mechanisms, and legal services; and, (iv) provide support for sector
institutions to provide outreach activities and to advance the dissemination o f legal and judicial
information. IDA also plans to propose supporting a system-wide information and planning
system beginning in December 2006 through the legal component o f the Public Sector Reform
Project, which should improve the overall availability o f sectoral data. IDA has rightly been
cautious to proceed slowly in this area as government ownership and commitment have not yet
fully materialized.
41.
The World Bank Group’s performance for Pillar I11 was satisfactory. Excellent policy
advice and technical assistance by IDA and the IMF helped Government make significant
improvements in budget management. M&E support provided by IDA was also appreciated by
the client and helped improve PARPA monitoring. IDA’s support for the corruption outcome,
however, could be more strategic and coordinated across the portfolio. IDA did not have an
integrated and coordinated strategy for addressing corruption within the portfolio, nor did it have
a definitive strategic position on how to deal with corruption in the country. Nonetheless, the
Bankwide strategy for governance and anti-corruption was only finalized recently. Finally, IDA
could have also been more decisive in i t s use o f the PRSC instrument in order to accelerate
implementation o f the procurement and Anti-Corruption plans, and to improve compliance for
PAF anti-corruption objectives (e.g. prosecution o f cases).

V.

World Bank Group Performance- Portfolio Management

IDA Lending

42.
Portfolio Composition. During the FY04-07 CAS period, 12 IDA lending operations and
one supplemental credit were approved, totaling $683 million, including an estimated $2 15
million commitment for FY07. Three GEF operations, with a value o f $6 million, were also
approved (see Attachment 3). This i s in line with the base case scenario outlined in the CAS. O f
the 12 IDA lending operations, three were PRSCs, which totaled $250 million, or 38 percent o f
all lending. Most o f the projects planned in the CAS were implemented during the latter half o f
the CAS period, during FY06 and FY07, reflecting slippages in preparation; only four projects
were prepared on schedule. The Maputo Municipal Development APL (ProMaputo) was not
planned in the CAS and was added during FY07. Total projects under implementation during

- 62 -

this period averaged 21, including two GEF projects and one regional p r ~ j e c t , ~with
’
an average
total commitment o f approximately $1 billion. In all, $982 million was disbursed from IDA
credits and grants to GoM during the CAS period (Appendix 7a). Total World Bank Group
transfers to Mozambique during the four years o f the CAS total $2,461 million, along with $331
million o f M I G A and IBRD guarantees and another $1,091 million o f HIPC and MDRI debt
relief for the IMF and the African Development Bank (Appendices 7b and 7c).
43.
Portfofio Age. The portfolio age i s somewhat old. As o f December 2006, nine o f the 19
IDA operations under implementation are at least five years old. Twelve projects (eleven IDA,
one GEF) exited the portfolio during the CAS period.
44.
Portfofio Performance. Between FY05 and FY07, three to five projects, or one quarter o f
the portfolio, were at risk28at any one time, which i s roughly equivalent to the Africa Region
average. The recurrent problem projects include the MAP HIV/AIDS Response Project, the
Public Sector Reform Project, the Municipal Development Project, the Energy and Access
Reform Project, and the Coastal and Marine Biodiversity Management Project. Slow start-up and
effectiveness delays were common. Start-up and implementation delays also led to frequent
closing date extensions. O f the 19 IDA projects currently under implementation, nine projects, or
almost 50 percent, have had their closing dates extended, one by six months, two by 12 months,
three by 18 months, two by 24 months, and one by 30 months. Slow disbursement, procurement,
financial management, counterpart funding, and M&E are the most common flags raised.
45.
Counterpart Funding. Counterpart funding has been a recurrent problem for the
Mozambique portfolio since at least 1999 when it was flagged in some project documents as a
potential implementation risk. Yet, this issue has continued be a major cause o f implementation
delays for most projects in the portfolio during FY05 and FY06.29 Counterpart funding was a
flag for five projects under implementation in December 2006. A Bank note on counterpart
funding issues written during FY06 points to several causes, including: (i)
the failure o f the
Ministry o f Finance to budget adequately for counterpart funding requirements in some projects,
which i s partly linked to the failure o f some projects to provide adequate and timely data to the
Ministry; and (ii)
insufficient commitment by G o M for some projects. Mozambique was among
the three countries in the Africa Region with the highest number o f flags for counterpart funding
during FY05, and had the highest number o f such flags in FY06 and FY07.30 To facilitate
implementation, G o M has applied for 100 percent IDA financing for selected projects.
46.
VAT Payments. An issue related to counterpart funding that has caused implementation
problems i s government delay in refunding V A T payments to contractors. T h i s delay has
contributed to procurement delays and to some contractors raising prices in order to make up for
the loss o f V A T refunds, which in turn causes cost overruns. Most o f infrastructure projects and
others with civil works are affected.
Mapped under AFC16.
Projects at risk include problem projects (Le., projects that have the Development Objective or Implementation
Progress rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory or Unsatisfactory) and projects that have three or more flags raised.
29 Many projects experienced delays related to counterpart funding but did not raise the flag.
30 Mozambique had five projects with counterpart fund (CF) flags in both 2006 and 2007. The next highest number
o f CF flags for similarly-sized portfolios was two. In 2005, Mozambique had two projects with CF flags, while two
other portfolios had a higher number - Uganda had four and Madagascar hard three.

- 63 -

47.
Design and Quality-at-entry, Only two projects were rated for Quality-at-Entry by QAG
during the CAS period: the GEF Transborder Parks Project (TF-28483) and the Health Sector
Recovery Project (Cr. C2788). Both received satisfactory ratings in all categories. Project design,
however, could have benefited from less complexity, taking into account the capacity o f the
client. In addition, implementation readiness could have been better, especially in the areas o f
procurement and financial management. Finally, the reviews found that project implementation
would have benefited from a better appreciation o f the political economy, including a more
realistic assessment o f client commitment. Quality-at-entry problems led to long-term problem
status and subsequent restructurings for the Coastal and Marine Biodiversity Management
Project, Public Sector Reform Project, Energy Reform and Access Project, and the Municipal
Development Project. The Education Sector Strategy Project was not restructured but was in
problem status during the first two years o f implementation.
48.
Closed Projects. O f the eight projects (seven IDA, one GEF) that closed by end FY06,
four have been rated by IEG. The Health Sector Delivery Project and the Second Road and
Coastal Project received the highest ratings in all five performance categories (see Attachment
7); the Economic Management (EMPSO) Project received the top ratings in three o f the five
performance categories, moderately satisfactory rating for outcome and a modest rating for
institutional development impact; the GEF Transborder Parks Project received a satisfactory
rating in the borrower performance category.
49.
Two projects drafted Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs) during FY07 but have
not been evaluated by IEG. The I C R for the Education Sector Strategy Project cites poor project
design as a major reason for project implementation to be rated unsatisfactory from end-2000 to
2002 and for the 24-month extension o f the closing date. The I C R for the Enterprise
Development Project rated IDA Supervision Moderately Satisfactory, as financial management
and internal control irregularities which escalated in the final eighteen months o f the project were
not flagged to Management until near project closing. The project provided a platform for
collaboration and joint experience with development partners; however, feedback provided to the
ICR indicates IDA could have involved development partners more effectively in the
implementation and supervision process. Recurrent lessons from ICRs and IEG reviews include:
over-complexity o f design; low pre-implementation readiness; and poor incorporation o f political
economy factors and assurance o f client commitment.

IDA Non-lending

.

50.
The non-lending program includes 17 pieces o f analytical work (see Attachment 4a),
including two core pieces o f economic and sector work - the Second Public Expenditure Review
and a Country Economic Memorandum - and seven technical assistance activities. The Second
Public Expenditure Review and the Country Economic Memorandum were completed in FY04FY06, together with studies o f value chains, contract farming, technical and vocational
education, health status, constraints to achieving the health MDG, legal and judicial status,
governance and anti-corruption, and the poverty and social impact o f changes in primary school
fees. The program o f technical assistance included activities aimed at strengthening capacity to
implement the PARPA, focusing in particular o n public expenditure management, as well as

- 64 -

technical assistance in the main productive sectors. Technical advisories from IFC and MIGA
complemented the non-lending program.

5 1.

Economic and Sector Work (ESW). ESW conducted during the CAS period have been
relevant and o f high quality. Improvements can be made, however, in timing, dissemination,
planning o f the output, and coordinating with Government and donors. Explicit attention also
needs to be paid to ensure that the analytical work i s demand-driven. Findings in all analytical
work were used to inform current or subsequent operations. Quality and peer reviews praise the
quality o f the deliverables. However, slippages o f planned ESW were common (see Attachment
4b) and (as noted during the 2004 Q A G review o f Mozambique AAA) often resulted in
reshuffling and a scrambling for funds. Some ESW products appear not to have been reviewed
(or read) beyond the task team. Although the country website posts the major reports, there is no
central repository that keeps track o f all deliverables. Although most o f the ESW produced have
been demand-driven, there have been a few instances where other donors and counterparts did
not support the commissioning o f the work. The Country Team discussed these issues during the
development o f the new Country Partnership Strategy, and has agreed on measures to ensure
better planning, coordination, funding, and dissemination o f future analytical work.
52.
Technical Assistance and Policy Advice. Technical assistance and policy advice efforts
have been demand-driven, o f high quality and timely. These included fiscal policy advice
regarding mineral resources and financing arrangements for the Cahora Bassa dam. Staff based
in the Country Office also provide day-to-day advice to government counterparts, especially in
public expenditure management, financial management, procurement, ICT, energy, HIV/AIDS,
and agricultural and rural development.

IDA Instruments
53.
PRSCs. The Mozambique portfolio has achieved balance between projects and budget
support. Almost 40 percent o f new lending is through budget support using the PRSC instrument.
In determining the amount o f budget support, the portfolio balances key parameters including: (i)
Paris Declaration and donor harmonization targets for lending in the form o f program support;
(ii)Government demand for the World Bank Group to lead or engage in specific projects to
benefit from the knowledge base and technical expertise o f the World Bank Group; (iii)
the
readiness o f country systems for further budget support; and (iv) the ability o f the country to
meet agreed performance targets and triggers. G18 partners who provide direct budget support
and Government use the Performance Assessment Framework, a prioritized subset o f indicators
from the PARPA I1 Strategic Matrix, to guide decision-making on budget support. Although the
performance framework i s clear, what is less clear and subject to negotiation among donors and
Government i s the level o f under-performance that would lead donors to provide less budget
support.
54.
Common Funds and SWAPS. The Bank's program for Mozambique has in principle
been supportive o f SWAPS and common funds as a means o f providing low-transaction cost
lending to Government and for coordinating with other donors. The first SWAP supported by
IDA was PROAGRI for the agricultural sector. This SWAP was approved in August 1999 and
closed December 31,2006. Although this SWAP helped achieve notable institutional and policy
changes, IDA and other key donors have decided to discontinue support for the second phase o f

- 65 -

the SWAP due to under-performance o f the first. IDA did not participate in any additional
SWAP during t h e CAS period. Participation in common h d s for projects has neither been easy
nor particularly successful. The main challenges have been in reconciling IDA’S fiduciary
policies and procedures with those o f Government and other donors, and weaknesses in
government procurement and financial management systems. For example, the project team
sought to include the MAP HIV/AIDS Response Project in a multi-donor common fimd but the
actual effort to do so took almost two years. Similarly, an attempt to create a common fund for
the provision o f financial sector assistance failed due to procurement and disbursement concerns.
Despite these obstacles, the country team continues to work on aligning Bank work better with
national systems.

55.
APLs have facilitated longer term planning for promising programs to test approaches
before deepening reforms or expanding-to other locations, and ultimately to achieve greater
impact. The Roads and Bridges APL series i s an example o f a program that has used this
instrument effectively. Going forward, the Country Team i s incorporating t h i s lesson into the
new portfolio by planning more APLs.
56.
Regional Projects: Only one regional project, the Regional HIV/AIDS Treatment
Acceleration Project, was approved during the CAS period. Regional integration opportunities
have not been explored systematically by the country team. Interviews with selected government
counterparts reveal that most are not aware o f the IDA funds available under the IDA Regional
Integration Pilot. The country team has recently begun to work with the Regional Integration
Team and other country teams to prepare four regional IDA projects, two GEF projects and one
IDF project.31According to team members, notwithstanding the merits o f such regional projects,
high transaction costs (stemming from working in more than one country), and lack o f incentives
within the Bank for such activities discourage task team leaders from pursuing regional projects

VI.

Aid Coordination/ Donor Harmonization

57.
Development aid partners and Government have collaborated to implement an impressive
donor coordination and harmonization framework in Mozambique. Government meets with
Program Aid Partners yearly to discuss PARPA implementation, update PAF targets, and ensure
alignment o f development partner support with budget priorities and reporting. Joint Sector
Working Groups meet regularly and frequently to review sector issues, agree on action plans,
and divide responsibilities. Performance and participation varies across working groups,
however. The G18 donors have also committed to the Paris Declaration and have set related
targets for themselves. The Bank Group has been responsive in making adjustments to meet
many Paris Declaration indicators including: reducing the use o f project implementation units,
increasing the use o f joint missions and joint analytical work, and in the amount o f budget
support provided. However, several attempts to join common fund arrangements have yet to
come to fruition. Government and development partners have asked the Bank Group to define
requirements for i t s adoption o f country systems for financial management, procurement, and
audits, and the Bank Group is currently responding to that request.

Client Feedback

58.
Interviews o f selected government officials, civil society, and private sector counterparts
were conducted during the preparation o f this report (see Attachment 8). Generally, client
impressions o f the World Bank Group are positive and reflect in large part the responsiveness o f
the growing World Bank Group presence in the Maputo office. Civil society, especially, has
appreciated recent Bank Group efforts to consult them on development matters, including during
the preparation o f the new CPS, and they stress that more is needed. Major points highlighted
during these consultations include:

The World Bank Group is needed for its financing role, technical assistance, knowledge, and
as an interlocutor and convener o f donors. Every major sector has requested that the Bank
Group continue to be a major sponsor o f i t s operations. According to those interviewed,
projects gamer greater support with the involvement o f the World Bank Group and the
knowledge and capacity building generated by projects i s highly valued.
Better coordination i s needed both within IDA, within the World Bank Group, and between
IDA and other donors, including more effort in explaining their respective roles to
stakeholders (clients sometimes get confused about the organization and roles o f World Bank
Group staff). World Bank Group capacity building efforts, especially, need to be more
integrated and coordinated across sectors and providers.
Government has requested that the Bank Group provide strengthened and more coordinated
support for private sector development.
Country demand for regional integration i s increasing. At the same time, many government
clients did not know about the IDA Regional Integration Pilot program and funding available
for regional integration efforts.

The World Bank Group’s fiduciary processes can be burdensome, especially given capacity
constraints. Government and other donors would like the Bank to fully embrace Paris
Declaration requirements with respect to the use o f country systems.

VI.

Conclusions and Lessons

59.
The World Bank Group’s performance in supporting CAS objectives has been
moderately satisfactory. CAS objectives have remained valid during the CAS period. The
Country Team has provided ongoing and valued technical assistance and policy advice in the
major sectors and in fiduciary areas. The presence o f Maputo-based sector staff has been
particularly valued by the client. The World Bank Group has also been responsive in many
instances, providing agile, just-in-time support to Government for unforeseen needs.
Collaboration between IDA and IFC and MIGA, and between IDA and IMF, i s strong. An area
o f support that did not meet Government expectations, however, was for private sector
development, which could have benefited from closer coordination within the World Bank
Group. Capacity development initiatives also lacked sufficient coordination across the portfolio,
nor have their results been tracked. Quality-at-entry, supervision, and portfolio management
shortcomings contributed to implementation delays, closing date extensions, and restructurings
for some long-term problem projects. Delays o f counterpart funding payments and Government
VAT refunds to contractors, especially, could be dealt with more effectively by the Country
Team.

- 67 -

60.

Key lessons for the Bank Group include:
Organizational

a. Better collaboration between IDA, IFC and MIGA. Improved coordination and
collaboration i s needed to answer Government’s demand for strengthened support in
private sector development. Moreover, given constrained IDA resources and reflecting
client needs, the Bank Group needs to better adapt i t s business model to exploit resources
available both within and outside o f the World Bank Group, including trust fbnds (e.g.,
the Carbon Fund).

b. Improve internal coordination across sectors. The experience during this CAS period
with HIV/AIDS,private sector development, and capacity development show that there i s
significant potential to improve cross-sector coordination. In particular, the attempt to
mainstream HIV/AIDS solutions across sectors and projects was haphazard rather than
strategic or systematic, and depended largely on the interest o f the task team leader. N o r
has collaboration to promote private sector development across and within sectors been
systematic (including across the World Bank Group, as noted above). Although about
one-third o f Bank financing is targeted for capacity development, a focused and
integrated strategy has not been developed. Here, the World Bank Institute and the
Africa Capacity Building Initiative (CDMAP) can play an important role, including in
results measurement o f capacity development initiatives. Cross-sector collaboration i s
especially important during the next CAS period as PARPA I1 emphasizes cross-cutting
themes (HIV/AIDS, gender, rural development and private sector development) that
require cross-sector collaboration. These challenges will require the country team to rethink how it i s organized and how it interfaces with Government, development partners,
and other stakeholders.
c. Articulate the Bank Group’s requirements regarding country systems related to
financial management, procurement and audits, and work with Government and
development partners to develop a capacity development plan for these areas. This
step i s required in accordance with the Paris Declaration but it i s also necessary to
accommodate lans for the greater use o f sector wide approaches and common fund
arrangements.3 P
Project Design

d. Better appreciation o f the country% political economy, reflected in the design o f
projects. Political economy factors are central to the stalled implementation for at least
four projects, specifically the timing o f project approvals. The Bank approved politically
risky projects just prior to elections, leaving ownership by the subsequent administration
less certain. Political realities should be taken into account in the timing and content o f
projects (and AAA). For infrastructure projects, especially, ESW and preparation work
should include analysis on potential winners and losers in interventions, and adjust design
32

The Bank Group i s currently responding to this request.

- 68 -

and implementation arrangements as appropriate. This should be done throughout
supervision as well. Implications for the composition o f infrastructure teams, in terms o f
broader skills, should be considered.
e. Simpler design and better project preparation to ensure a fit with Government’s
implementation capacity. Project design remains overly-complex, especially for
locally-implemented projects. Available capacity needs to be an important design
criterion. Similarly, projects need to make more intensive use of project preparation
facilities to ensure implementation readiness; halt the creation o f parallel project
implementation units and give more responsibilities to line ministries; and include
government procurement and financial management staff in preparation teams. Projects
also need to plan realistic implementation timeframes in order to avoid repeated
extension requests. Advancing pre-preparation readiness (through dialogue and
relationship building) and pre-implementation readiness are also key activities.

f. M o r e strategic, yet pragmatic exploration o f project opportunities for regional
integration. Many government counterparts are unaware o f the IDA Regional Integration
Pilot Program, a situation that i s being addressed. Only one regional integration project
was implemented during the CAS period. The country team i s now making a greater
effort to explore regional opportunities, but will need to ensure such projects have strong
multi-country ownership.

g. M o r e realistic CAS targets, and careful distinguishing of PAF targets vs. CAS
targets. Because o f the challenge o f attribution, PAF targets should only be selectively
included in the CAS results framework -- where they are specific triggers in the PRSC
series, or where the Bank Group program i s the main source o f support for achieving the
PAF target.
Project Supervision and Portfolio Monitoring

h. Effectively address recurrent and cross-cutting implementation issues. R Recurring
portfolio issues such as counterpart funding have been a barrier to implementation for
many projects, yet continue to persist. Political realities should be taken into account in
the timing, content and commitment to projects. Two issues that are closely linked to the
political economy and to the country’s financial management system are counterpart
funding and VAT refunds. Lack o f counterpart funds has hampered the implementation
progress o f several projects in the portfolio during the last three years; and slow or
insufficient VAT refunds to contractors has resulted in higher costs for infrastructure
projects and projects that involve building o f civil works. The Bank Group will consider
these issues in future project designs, as well as help Government address related
weaknesses in budget and financial management systems. For the current portfolio, the
new parameters for 100 percent financing have been used to retrofit existing projects
where ownership i s not an issue. For issues related to weak ownership, a realistic view on
the political feasibility and better project design and preparation i s key. Lack o f capacity,
especially acute at the sub-national level, i s another systemic problem that cuts across the
portfolio, and will need to be addressed through better project design and preparation. In

- 69 -

addition, a more concerted effort needs to be taken to build capacity for projects that have
decentralized components.

i. Address governance issues in all operations. Corruption in areas like service delivery
and procurement processes (even where activities are not using Bank Group h d s )
undermines the performance o f Bank Group operations and their impact on poverty
alleviation for the client. Lessons can be drawn from projects that have effectively
incorporated local accountability mechanisms in their design o f projects (as done by the
Decentralized Planning and Finance and the ProMaputo projects, for example); and have
implemented sector governance and accountability fiameworks (as done by the Roads
and Bridges and National Water Development Project I1projects); capacity development
in fiduciary areas will also mitigate corruption risk at the project level.
j. Better coordination and dissemination o f analytic work. Analytical and advisory work
conducted during the CAS period have been relevant and o f high quality. Their findings
are used to inform subsequent project design and policy dialogue. Improvements can be
made, however, in the collaborative selection o f topics and the design o f joint work
programs, timing, and dissemination. Attention i s needed to ensure that analytical work i s
demand-driven.

k. Improve the monitoring o f results. Although new projects under preparation are
systematically paying more attention to results management, most projects under
implementation require actions to improve monitoring and evaluation. Data collection
and reporting on outcomes needs to be improved across the portfolio. Project teams will
also need to focus on helping sectors develop M&E systems which would in turn help
project data collection and reporting.

Appendix 8b. Summary o f Mozambique's Progress towards the MDGs as o f End-2005
Mozambique i s likely to achieve the Poverty MDG as well as the Water MDG targets. A detailed
discussion follows:

Mozambique is likely to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger (Goal 1). The poverty headcount
ratio declined from 69 perqent o f 54.5 percent between 1996-1997 and 2002-2003. Taking into
account demographic growth over the period covered by the two surveys, the number o f people who
were lifted out o f poverty is estimated at 3.7 million, Given that only two surveys are available, and
assuming that the current trend would continue, Mozambique i s expected to half the population
living in absolute poverty.
Good progress has been made towards achieving universal of primary education (Goal 2);
nevertheless more progress is required to meet this MDG. Substantial progress has been made in
increasing access to primary education, particularly in lower primary schools (EP1, grades 1
through 5). Government has continued to make progress with reforms that will bear results in the
near future, however, more reforms will be needed to increase enrollment and completion rates as
well as gender disparities and quality o f primary education.
Mozambique remains stable with respect to gender equality and empowering women (Goal 3).
Gender indicators at all levels o f education have improved, particularly in EP1 and the gender
difference in net enrollment ratio was reduced to only 4 percentage points. Nevertheless, significant
gender gaps remain at the second level o f primary education and first level o f secondary education.
More progress remains to be made also in women's involvement in the productive sectors and in
positions o f authority.
Substantial progress has been made towards reducing child mortality and good progress has been
made in increasing immunization rates (Goal 4). Both infant mortality and the under-five
mortality rates have declined substantially from 1996 to 2002 and immunization rates have had a
steady increase over the past years.
Good progress has been made in improving maternal health (Goal 5). Maternal mortality has
decreased and the number o f attended births has increased slightly, however Mozambique continues
to have some o f the lowest indicators in the region for these targets.
There has been'little progress in combating HIWAIDS, malaria and other diseases (Goal 6).
Adult prevalence rates have increased to 16.2 percent. Despite improvements in setting up the
infrastructure needed for outreach and treatment, and in securing financial resources, only limited
progress has been made in reducing risky behaviors. There has been some progress in increasing the
proportion o f population using effective malaria prevention.
The MDGfor urban water is expected to be met, although little progress has been made in
ensuring environmental sustainability (Goal 7). The share o f people with access to safe drinking
water in urban areas has increased significantly and The MDG for sustainable coverage for urban
water supply to reach 70 percent i s expected to be met. In environmental management, however,
more remains to be done as government actions are ad hoc and not well coordinated.

do not disaggregate actual

common funds were not
