EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The World Bank will support Ghana’s Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS II)for the
country to achieve middle-income status and the MillenniumDevelopment Goals, and to ensure
that benefits of growth are shared. Overarching objectives are to support Ghana to: (i)
sustain
surpass the 20 15 Millennium Development Goal o f halving
economic growth o f at least 6% per year; (ii)
start to reduce inequalities.
poverty to 26% already during this CAS period; and (iii)
The World Bank Group Program i s anchored in the Consultative Group (CG) annual framework
of Results, Resources and Partnership, as agreed between the Government of Ghana and its
Development Partners. Based on the GPRS 11, the overall Ghana Partnership Results Matrix i s the
prioritized framework also for the CAS, indicating objectives, baselines, targets, government action and
partner contributions. The Resource Overview maps both government and partner contributions. The
Aid Effectiveness and Harmonization Action Plan lays out commitments for the evolving partnership.
To further harmonize partners’ contributions, the Ghana Joint Assistance Strategy (GJAS) was
signed by 16 partners, representing 95% of aid disbursements, on February 27,2007. This CAS,
consists o f Part I,
the G-JAS, laying out commitments by partners, and Part 11, a W o r l d Bank Group
Program with Ghana. The two parts are complementary and need to be read together.
Under the previous CAS, Ghana exceeded the two over-arching objectives of increasing growth and
reducing poverty. The growth target was set at 5%, above the two preceding decades. In 2004-6,
average growth was 6%. The poverty target was set at 32% for 2007, compared to 39.5% in 1999. The
new Ghana Living Standard Survey indicates that the poverty level for 2005/6 i s 28.5%, allowing the
country a real prospect o f achieving the poverty MDG (26%) by 2008, a first o f i t s kind in Africa. The
CPIA rating improved from 3.5 in 2002 to 3.9 in 2005. Intermediate indicators were largely met; some
were exceeded (e.g. non-traditional exports and malnutrition); but some are not yet met, or unlikely to be
met (e.g. education quality, water and sanitation). The full high-case lending program o f $1.4 billion was
delivered, portfolio quality improved and disbursements accelerated. Major lessons include: government
and stakeholder ownership i s critical; the results framework needs to better map results to measurable
outcomes; Multi-Donor Budget Support (MDBS) has been critical; sector operations need to incorporate
multi-sectoral approaches; regional projects need to be closely aligned; integrating World Bank Group
engagement requires further effort; and decentralization o f Bank capacity i s critical to client needs.
The foundations for Ghana’s development are strong, but to break out of its low-income status and
meet its middle-income aspirations, Ghana needs a shift in governance performance. I t needs to
evolve the political economy around pro-growth policies and i t s capacity for value-for-money choices in
the public sector, also empowering district and municipal government. The C A S seeks to strengthen
overall development dialogue, based on evidence- and results-based public policy choice and an annual
Consultative Group (CG) framework; the role o f the budget, i t s fiduciary underpinnings, and i t s
importance to democratic decision-making; and sectoral policy, regulatory and institutional frameworks
to facilitate a jobs-creating private sector, an empowered civil society and a capable, accountable state.
Growth in Ghana has strongly contributed to poverty reduction, but consumption, spatial and
gender inequalities are emerging as significant challenges. The Ghana Living Standard Survey
(GLSS) shows that economic growth i s the major factor behind Ghana’s rapid reduction in poverty.
Growth can be sustained and accelerated in Ghana, and can therefore drive poverty levels down further.
However, inequalities, old and emerging, require strategic attention. Some rural areas, notably in the
north, but also elsewhere, see lower growth rates, less effective service provision, and slower poverty
reduction. Though not as poor, Ghana’s urban areas see new inequalities emerge. Ghana i s making only

limited progress o n gender equality, despite focus o n i t s importance. If not addressed, Ghana’s
modernization will be accompanied by greater internal inequalities. Broad-based jobs creation in a
growing economy will be the strongest factor to reduce poverty and diminish inequalities.

Analytical and advisory assistance (AAA) i s set to play a larger role. As the country evolves out o f a
low-income paradigm, the Bank’s role in providing AAA services needs strengthening. The GLSS will
provide a new statistical resource. A growth dialogue was initiated by the President o f Ghana, John A.
Kufuor, in February 2006, currently supported by the Bank’s Country Economic Memorandum. The new
analytics on growth and poverty and an overall review will determine the future AAA program.
IFC and MIGA have stepped up their engagement, allowing an integratedWorld Bank Group
approach to emerge. Ghana’s commitment to private sector-led development i s creating far larger space
for the Group’s instruments. B o t h the IFC and MIGA portfolios have grown considerably. I F C has
established a regional office in Accra, and the W o r l d Bank Group will establish a World Bank House in
Accra to further integrate operations.
Regional integrationi s critical to Ghana. As current chair o f the African Union (AU), Ghana i s
exercising a significant leadership role for regional cooperation. The World Bank has responded to
ECOWAS strategy by increasing support to energy (West Africa Gas Pipeline and Power Pool), transport
(critical corridors and trade transit), and other regional engagement (e.g. agricultural productivity), pivotal
also to Ghana’s growth. Future support needs to be even better integrated with national sector programs.
Results: The World Bank Program Results Matrix takes into account government’s indicationo f
its expectations, broad dialogue on nationalpriorities, partnershipalignment, lessons from
experience, and analyticalwork. Annual revisions o f the overarching Ghana Partnership Results Matrix
will allow the Bank’s activities to become more effective and tightly aligned, based on experience.
Support will be provided both through general budget support in the form o f a series o f poverty
reduction support credits and further analyticaland financial support to the three pillars o f GPRS
11, by: (i)
raising private sector competitiveness through engagements in private and financial sector
development, modernization o f agriculture, sustainable natural resource management, infrastructure and,
innovatively, employment policies; (ii)
improving human development outcomes, through interventions
in health, education, water and sanitation, and social protection; and (iii)
strengthening governance
through activities in decentralization, including urban policy, public sector reform, economic governance
and promoting evidence- and results-based public policy choice.
Partnership: Commitments to the new partnership standards will determine the choice of Bank
instruments. The M D B S framework remains fundamental. The Bank will increasingly use development
policy operations to support sector programs, but investment lending will continue to be needed, also for
regional operations. The Bank will remain engaged in a broad framework o f sectors, given i t s size and
government’s request. Sector alignment should reduce overall transaction costs. Ambitious indicators
have been set to track the Bank’s commitment to harmonization, alignment and aid effectiveness.
Resources: Ghana provides considerable opportunity for scaled-up support. Ghana i s deploying i t s
own resources to i t s development objectives, notably increasing poverty-related public expenditure from
7.7% in 2004 to 10.5% in 2006. Overall investment i s 30% o f GDP. Partners have increased support
from about $700 million in 2002 to above $1200 million in 2006. Ghana n o w has a far stronger debt
sustainability perspective than before and intends to access non-concessionary finance for infrastructure.
Ghana will need to exercise far stronger value-for-money control over public expenditure and
public/private-partnerships.The overall CG partnership needs to help ensure that additional finance,
concessionary or not, i s achieving additional gains. For i t s part, the Bank in this CAS sets out the

11

priorities for currently available IDA levels, but also spells out a scaled-up scenario. The Bank Group
will look to i t s whole set o f instruments, including IFC, MIGA, IBRD (while not yet being able to borrow
from IBRD, Ghana may seek enclave project finance) and IDA guarantees.
I n conclusion, Ghana has a strong opportunity to sustain higher levels of economic growth to
achieve middle-income status, surpass the poverty Millennium Development Goal, and start to
reduce inequalities. The Results, Resources and Partnership framework o f the CG provides possibilities
to increase the value o f external support. The World Bank Group seeks to be a key partner.

1. Introduction
1.1

Rationale for the Ghana Joint Assistance Strategy

The Ghana Joint Assistance Strategy (G-JAS) aims to improve the alignment of
development assistance with the core business of Government and the
Government‘s political and partnership cycle. It builds on commitments by
development partners (DPs) to work toward the achievement of goals and priorities
of the second Ghana Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS II) and to
accelerate progress against mutually defined harmonization principles.
An important backdrop for the G-JAS is the Ghana Partnership Strategy (GPS)
endorsed at the November 2005 Consultative Group/Annual Partnership Meeting
(CG/APM) and updated for the CG/APM in June 2006. The GPS comprises a results
matrix which maps DP-funded activities to GPRS II policy priorities; an annual
harmonisation action plan; and an overview of external assistance, detailed by GPRS
II pillar and sectors. As such, the GPS provides a framework for monitoring the
effectiveness of development assistance in supporting GPRS II.
The G-JAS involves the majority of Ghana’s GPS development partners (representing about 95% of official development assistance flows), who wish to take the DP
response in support of the GPRS II one step further. It consists of five interlinking
elements that contribute to a comprehensive approach on the part of DPs to the aid
relationship in Ghana:
(i)
(ii)

a joint assessment of the current country situation (political, economic, social);
a joint description of the major challenges facing Ghana in its quest to achieve
the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and middle-income status;
(iii) a statement of principles and commitments on how G-JAS partners will work
with each other, with Government, and with civil society and private
stake hoIders;
(iv) priorities for the joint DP response at the GPRS II pillar and sector level; and
(v) arrangements for results monitoring and risk mitigation.
The G-JAS should be seen as a milestone in an on-going process, which provides a
framework for continued action over the next four years. Concrete actions for moving
forward are therefore presented as part of the G-JAS conclusions.
The timeframe for the G-JAS is the four year period starting in 2007 and ending in
2010. This timeframe has been adopted to take into account national cycles in
Ghana: new governments are elected in December every four years (2004,2008,
2012) and the next GPRS time-slice is prepared during the government’s first year in
office (2005, 2009, 2013) for implementation during the next four year cycle (20062009, 2010-2013, etc.). The first year of GPRS implementation (2006, 2010, 2014) is
therefore the time when G-JAS partners can consult with government and
stakeholders to review new GPRS priorities and make any needed alignment and
programming adjustments, which would then be reflected in the subsequent G-JAS
framework (2007-2010, 201 1-2014, etc.).
The linkages between the national level development framework (GPRS II and the
Africa Peer Review Mechanism, APRM), the GPS, and the G-JAS are presented in
Figure 1:

February 2007

G-JAS

Figure 1: The National Strategy Context and the GJ A S

Following adoption of the G-JAS, partner-by-partner decision making on aid allocations will be replaced by better cooperation and joint programming, anchored in the
national development strategy. More concretely, we expect to see by the end of the
G-JAS period:

..
..
.

.

higher quality dialogue between DPs and the government,
improved aid delivery through a better division of labour and a solid process for
deciding who does what,
greater harmonisation in the way development assistance is delivered,
increased reliance on programme based modalities and coordinated technical
assistance programmes that support government priorities,
improved predictability in resource flows and reduced transactions costs for
government, and
better alignment of DP country strategies and resource allocations with GPRS II
goals and priorities.

The G-JAS reflects strong Development Partner political will to engage in a more
harmonised and efficient dialogue with the government in all aspects of development
cooperation. However, we note that the G-JAS is not legally binding. To the extent
that the G-JAS is inconsistent with the laws or policies of any signatory, such laws,
policies, and commitments will prevail.

Partners in the G-JAS Process

The role of Government in the G J A S process

The government has developed the GPRS II (2006-2009) and has welcomed the DP
initiative to better define how the development community will support GPRS II
implementation. By seeking to reduce fragmentation, improve harmonised working,
and enhance alignment, the G-JAS seeks to support government leadership of its
national development strategy. DPs consulted the government at key milestones in
the development of the G-JAS, and sought its feedback in the formulation of the final
document.
Overall, the government finds the G-JAS to be a good start at developing a
harmonised approach to multi-annual programming. However, DPs were encouraged
to be more ambitious in setting performance targets and accelerating introduction of
harmonized modalities. As the government would like to avoid increased transaction
costs when engaging with DPs, it has requested that harmonized approaches and
procedures be as streamlined as possible. The government also encouraged DPs to
keep in mind its desire to see budget support increase as a share of official
development assistance, within a scaled-up financial envelope for the country. DPs
have taken these comments on board, and will seek to apply their spirit in the
implementation of the G-JAS.
Regarding the future, the government accepts the need to be more involved in
directing the G-JAS process from this point forward, and welcomes further discussion
about how the government and DPs can improve our joint partnership, with the
objective of improving aid effectiveness and achieving development results. To
facilitate the partnership, government intends to define a clear aid and external
resource mobilisation strategy that can provide guidance for DPs.
The role of Civil Society Organisations in the GJ A S process

In its preparatory stages, civil society organisations (CSOs) were encouraged to give
their views on the G-JAS process and to share information about the strategic
priorities for the joint assistance programme. Following completion of the document,
it is expected that CSOs (NGOs, APRM Secretariat, Private Sector associations, as
well as independent research institutions) will be involved in monitoring
implementation of the aid partnership framework as provided for in the Paris
Declaration and the Ghana Harmonisation and Aid Effectiveness Action Plan (GHAP). Moreover, G-JAS DPs will seek to include Parliament as well as CSOs in a
more structured and transparent manner in the policy dialogue with the government
as well as in the design and discussion of cooperation programmes.

2. Country Analysis
2.1 Context
Ghana was the "shining star" of Africa at independence fifty years ago. The years
1960-1964 saw relatively high growth, spurred on by favorable export performance
and rapid industrialization linked to import-substitution policies. This encouraging
beginning gave way to macroeconomic instability, and uneven and volatile growth
from 1965-1983. This uncertain foundation, hit by economic shocks, brought the
economy close to collapse in the early 1980s.
Recognizing the need for change, the government launched the Economic Recovery
Program in the early 198O's, which succeeded in renewing growth and contributing to
significant poverty reduction. A process of political liberalisation was initiated in the
1990s which has culminated in an environment where political rights, civil liberties
and freedom of press indicators are as positive as those achieved by some middleincome countries. Country assessments put Ghana at the top of the rankings in
Africa,' and the country's leadership seeks to achieve the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs) and reach middle-income status by 2015.

2.2 Political Developments
The democratic process has made impressive gains in Ghana. As a result,
Ghana's political rights, civil liberties and freedom of press rankings are not only
amongst the best in Africa but are comparable to those recorded by countries at
much higher levels of income.* Democracy has become a strong competitive
advantage.
The government understands the need to consolidate political achievements,
and it is actively participating in the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM), a
governance initiative of the African Union. Ghana was the first country to be
reviewed under this initiative3and to prepare a programme of action, thanks to the
strong support of President Kufuor and the engaged participation of all stakeholders,
including civil society.
Governance reviews have identified some democratic deficits such as weak
accountability and oversight of the executive and patron-client relations in the
civil service and in government-business interaction^.^ This situation has made
reform of the civil service a lengthy process.
Ghana international ranking on corruption indicators is the best among lowincome African countries5 However, its ranking has slipped in the past few years,
and a recent national survey found that 75% of all households regarded corruption as
a serious national problem, with 80% feeling that it had worsened in the recent past.'

The weak system of checks and balances and politicised civil service create opportunities where corruption can occur. The Serious Fraud Office, the Commission on
Human Rights and Justice (CHRAJ) and civil society “watchdogs” are in place to fight
corruption, but are not yet robust.
Civil society is active and potentially a key driver for political governance
reforms. Farmers’ movements, Trades Unions and Professional Associations have
traditionally been involved in the nation’s political process. More recently, other civil
society organisations such as “home town” development associations, women’s
rights groups, welfare clubs, parent-teacher associations, faith based organisations
and groups providing social services are providing renewed vibrancy to civil society
engagement.’ The Diaspora is also increasing its involvement and has formed
Ghanaian Home Town Associations overseas. Some advocacy groups and think
tanks are well rooted in society, though often over-centralised in Accra.’ Civil society
groups offer great potential to strengthen the demand for good governance and
social accountability in government processes.
The government recognises that participation by different social groups in
national development is limited and needs to increase in order to reinforce
national consensus and reduce social polarisation. The government has made
some progress to date’ but there is much more that can be done to increase the
voice of citizens in the development process - as proposed both by the GPRS and
the APRM. The media is active and citizens are able to express their views on
development issues. However, citizens are often unaware of their rights vis-a-vis
government, and mechanisms for governmentlcitizen engagement remain
underdeveloped.
Progress in achieving gender equality goals has been limited. Gender equality is
not broadly accepted as a critical development issue, and women’s exclusion from
national processes, under-representation in public life and decision making, and
weak entitlements to economic assets appear at odds with Ghana’s performance in
the economic and political spheres. The government has introduced legislation and
policies to protect the rights of women and children”, however, implementation has
been weak. The African Peer Review Mechanism found strong cultural impediments
to the promotion and protection of women’s rights. A number of protocols for the
protection of the rights of children and women have not been ratified.
Decentralisation is essential to promote citizens’ participation and to achieve
better service delivery, but progress has been slow. Part of the delay in
decentralizing staff and fiscal resources is due to concerns about local capacity,
combined with the normal reluctance of ‘the center’ to lose resources and influence;
and part of the delay is due to the complexity of managing such a process. The 2007
budget authorized a significant transfer of civil servants from Ministries, Departments,
and Agencies (MDAs) to district authorities, for implementation in 2008. Political
reforms at the local level are still under discussion, as one-third of members of the
District Assemblies and the District Chief Executives are not elected but are
appointed by the President. Citizen Surveys report dissatisfaction with the
performance of District Assemblies”.

Ghana has not suffered significant internal conflicts and traditional authorities
have a recognised role in local conflict management. However, Chieftaincy-related
disputes about land, inheritance and succession have the potential to lead to local
conflicts.” There is also a risk that multi-party electoral contests may fuel local
conflicts. The military is subordinated to democratic institutions.
Ghana plays a key role in the sub-region and at the regional level. Ghana
provides an example of successful political and economic performance in West
Africa, a region that includes a number of countries that have experienced violent
conflicts. Ghana is also a strong supporter of regional integration and conflict
prevention initiatives of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)
as well as an active participant in UN peacekeeping activities (including the Kofi
Annan International Peace Keeping Training Centre). Recognizing Ghana’s policy of
“good neighbourliness” and strong engagement with the APR mechanism, President
Kufuor was elected Chairman of the African Union in January 2007.

2.3 Economic Developments
Ghana’s economy has registered robust economic growth rates since the year
2000, despite sharp increases in international crude prices. Growth of real gross
domestic product (GDP) increased progressively from 3.7% to 5.9% between 2000
and 2005, driven by the strong performance of cocoa and gold exports. The outlook
for 2006 appears positive, although the impact of the energy crisis which hit in late
2006 could adversely affect growth in 2007, if underlying policy and investment
factors are not addressed.

Macroeconomic and financial sector stability have steadily improved, removing
two key constraints to private sector growth. Prudent fiscal and monetary
policies have benefited from a fairly stable external environment, and have
contributed to a decline in end-year inflation rates from 40% to 14% from 2000 to
2005. The general decline of the overall fiscal deficit from 9% (2001) to 3.0% in 2005,
coupled with the decline in the domestic-debt-to-GDP ratio from 29% (2002) to 11%
in 2005 have impacted positively on declining interest rates.13 The declining public
sector deficits have reduced the pressures for public domestic borrowing and
provided scope for an increase in the share of credit to the private sector from 13.1%
of GDP in 2004 to approximately 20% of GDP in 2006. The positive impact of macro
and financial stability on the private sector cannot be overestimated.

Financial sector reform is progressing and the potential for competition is well
above most countries in the region. The financial sector is healthy and relatively
open, with banks generally liquid and meeting prudential standards. The role of
Government in the banking sector is limited, and new entrants from overseas have
enhanced innovation in products and services. However, despite increased
competition and a reduction in the prime rate, the spread between deposit rates and
commercial lending rates remains high. The sector has benefited from a modern
payment and clearing architecture with real-time gross settlement system since 2002,
a more recent automation of cheque clearing and integration of rural banks into the
electronic payments platform, and the establishment of a Central Securities
Depository System for government and stock exchange listed securities. Measures
have been taken in recent years to improve banking supervision (Banking Act 2004),
promote financial deepening (Credit Rating Agency bill, Foreign Exchange bill), and
provide safeguards against money laundering (Anti-Money Laundering bill).
Improved macroeconomic management and sustained growth has contributed
to Ghana's healthy debt outlook. Other factors include an improved revenue
position, especially in the tax and duty system, and steady increases in official
development assistance and in private remittance^.'^ Ghana reached the HlPC
Completion Point in July 2004. This paved the way for the country to benefit from the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), which reduced the debt stock from US$6.4
billion to US$1.5 billion and provides new opportunities for targeted, pro-poor, public
spending.
Remittances and tourism are increasingly important sources of foreign
exchange. Private transfers were estimated at about US $1.5 billion in 2005 and are
projected to increase in the coming years. They result from Ghana's high rates of
emigration of skilled workers15,with estimates indicating that private remittances
originate mostly in the USA and Canada (50%) and the United Kingdom (25%).16
Tourism receipts have also grown steadily over the past five years and are projected
to reach US$ 1 billion in 2006." As in other regions, the human and financial
resources of the Diaspora have an enormous potential to contribute to the development of the country through direct engagement with families and community groups.

Current growth rates put Ghana on track to meet the MDG on halving poverty
levels by 2015. The latest comprehensive estimates show that the poverty
headcount declined from 52 percent in 1991, with 36 percent living in extreme
poverty, to 40 percent in 1999 and 15 percent of Ghanaians in extreme poverty. The
most recent Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire (CWIQ), which uses an asset
rather than an income-based poverty measure, indicates that there has been a 7
percentage point reduction from 42 percent in 1997 to 35 percent in 2003. The two
trends are indicative of general progress, although they are not directly comparable
with one another. Updated information on recent income poverty trends will be
available in early 2007 once the results of the fifth Ghana Living Standards Survey
(GLSS 5) are tabulated.
Despite the recent economic expansion, the structure of the economy has not
changed substantially. The economy continues to be largely dependent on agriculture (40% of GDP and 50% of employment)". It is constrained by low-productivity
farming practices, poor infrastructure (e.g. roads, irrigation, and ICT), land tenure
uncertainties, gender inequities, and uncertain access to inputs. Traditional exports cocoa, gold and other natural resources - still account for almost half of GDP. The
industrial sector remains relatively small and dominated by firms with low
productiv;?. Foreign direct investment is relatively low for an economy of Ghana's
potential.
Although overall poverty levels are declining, socio-economic and regional
disparities remain, and are linked to the lack of structural change in the economy.
Weaknesses in human and social development (in terms of investment in children
and young people's health and education) are reflected in the gap between Ghana's
Human Development Index (HDI) rank (138 in 2003)20and its gradually increasing
GDP per capita rank (121 in the same year). There is a strong urban-rural differential
in poverty indicators, with deprivation levels substantially higher in some rural areas.
The severity and depth of poverty is highest in three northern regions (Northern,
Upper West and Upper East) and parts of the rural coastal zones.21 There is
potential for growth-driven poverty reduction in these regions, but it will need targeted
investments by Government and policy reforms aimed at encouraging private sector
development in these areas." Recent growth trends have fuelled the movement of
people from rural to urban areas, where they are concentrated in sectors with limited
employment prospects for those living in poverty. What appears to matter most in
determining inequality and poverty in urban areas is the level of education of
household heads.
Ghana's trade regime is open and Ghana is a strong advocate of regional
cooperation and integration. Exports to the EC and the USA account for 53% and
7%, respectively, of total Ghanaian exports, while Africa accounts for 11% of total
exports (2002). Ghana is an important trading partner with its three neighbours and it
is committed to the ECOWAS regional framework. In order to meet its objective of
becoming a middle-income country by 2015, Ghana's non-traditional exports must
expand also into growing regional markets.

Ghana has achieved the highest electrification rate in Sub-Saharan Africa
(54%), and is the anchor country for the West-African Power Pool. However, fast
economic growth combined with under-investment, poor planning, and reliance on
seasonally variable hydropower have led to a situation where power supply is now
unreliable and becoming a binding constraint to growth. Annual growth in electricity
consumption is estimated to be 12%, and government‘s strategy is to increase
access to grid electricity for domestic users from 54% to 75% by 2015. This would
require substantial investment and improvement in managing the existing network
and its regulation.
Transport and communications infrastructure are in a poor state to cope with
recent economic growth and expansion of basic service delivery, due to
insufficient maintenance and weak strategies. Transport is key to facilitating both
improved productivity in agriculture and agro-industry (by linking rural production to
processing centers and trading points) and development of Ghana’s human
resources (by ensuring rural communities’ access to schools, clinics and water
points). Road density in Ghana is 248 km per 1,000 sq km, compared to 368 in lower
middle-income countries and 1,015 in high-income countries. The Government has
invested in expansion of the network; however, this expansion has not been
accompanied by sufficient emphasis on network maintenance, with the result that
only 34% of roads are in good condition. Currently, port capacity is under pressure
from increased traffic: between 2004 and 2005, the volume in tonnes (imporVexport
average) increased by I O % , container traffic increased by 15%, and the number of
vessels increased 27%. Air traffic growth lags behind growth of other regional hubs.
The growth in information and communications technology (ICT) has been rapid, with
current phone penetration at 20% (from 4% in 2000). The price of communications
remains high, however, and quality remains relatively low. 23
Natural resources and environment need careful management to assure longterm growth. Minerals, fisheries, forestry and wildlife represent 15% of GDP, 25%
of government revenues and a substantial source of livelihood through artisanal
activities. Inadequate potable water supply, sanitation and hygiene and air pollution
(urban and indoor) seriously affect the burden of disease and quality of growth in the
rapidly growing economy. Poor management of these resources, with related health
effects, is costing Ghana approximately 10% of GDP,24with 4% due to forestry and
wildlife depletion and 4% due to water and air pollution. The sustainability of these
key productive sectors and the prospects for community development and economic
growth are put at risk by the absence of effective regulatory institutions and by
indecisive leadership on issues related to sustaining the natural resource base and
managing the environment.
Institutional reforms of the public sector have had limited success to date.
Recognition of this factor was behind the government‘s decision to create the
Ministry of Public Sector Reform (MoPSR) in April 2005 and launch the Public Sector
Reform (PSR) reform strategy and programme of action in March 2006. The reform
program aims to improve performance management, remuneration, and accountability, starting with the civil service. In addition to reform of the civil service, the
government has developed a framework for reforming subvented agencies, and a
new Subvented Agencies Law (Act 706) was enacted by Parliament and gazetted in
April 2006. On the public expenditure front, poverty-related expenditures have
increased from 6.5 percent of GDP at the end of 2003 to 8.5 percent in 2005, and the

government reports that budget expenditures are increasingly in line with GPRS II.
However, policy formulation, programme implementation and the capacity to
coordinate DP assistance need to be strengthened. Efficiency of public spending is
low and is increasingly the focus of government attention.

2.4 Human and Social Developments
Progress in education has meant increasing numbers of children are entering
school and progressing through the system. A major breakthrough was the
abolition of mandatory school fees for basic education and the introduction of
capitation grants through the country in the 2005/6 academic year. Non-salary
expenditure allocations to deprived regions almost doubled over the GPRS I period.25
As a result of some of these changes, Ghana is judged to be on track to achieve both
MDG2 (Universal Primary Education) and MDG3 (gender parity in primary enrolment)
by 201 5. (Ghana’s gender parity ratio at the primary level was 0.95 in 2005).
Improving access and quality in basic education are the central challenges.
These include ensuring that children outside the school system (estimated presently
at about 700,000 children) are enrolled and those at risk of dropping out are
encouraged to complete primary education. Access problems are exacerbated for atrisk groups, including girls, children from deprived regions, disabled children and the
extremely poor in rural and urban areas. There is also a persistent challenge to
improve the quality of learning through increasing and monitoring the distribution of
inputs. The number of qualified teachers, core textbooks, and classrooms in good
condition must keep up with increased enrolment. All these interventions require
increased and sustained per student funding at primary level in real terms over the
next ten years, as well as increased and targeted programmatic funding to address
these policy priorities.
Gradual improvements in the delivery of a number of critical health outputs
have taken place. A pre-paid National health Insurance Scheme introduced in 2004
marks a new direction in health financing for poor and vulnerable groups. Recent
indications are that the HIV prevalence rate may be dropping, although it is too soon
to determine a trend. Malaria, however, remains a significant cause of mortality and
costs the equivalent of 3 percent of GDP annually.
Infant and child health indicators and maternal mortality rates appear stalled at
high levels. Current estimates show a stagnation in neonatal mortality between 1998
and 2003.’’ Progress in reducing infant and under-five mortality levels stalled during
GPRS I. Child malnutrition also remains a significant problem, accounting for up to
60 percent of the cases of child mortality and pointing to the need for a comprehensive approach to adequate nutrition, care and food security, especially amongst the
poorest households. Infant mortality (IMR) and maternal mortality (MMR) are
inextricably linked. Nationally estimated maternal mortality stands at 214 deaths per
100,000 live births, although the adjusted figure published by the UN is 540 deaths
per 100,000. In either case Ghana is off track in achieving the MDGs on both MMR
and IMR counts. Of particular concern is that these trends have coincided with a
period of increased health sector financing.” The next opportunity to take stock of
trends will be the Demographic Health Survey in 2008.

Access to water and sanitation services is progressing, but not as rapidly as
needed. The approach to rural water delivery is based on community ownership
and management. Coverage by functioning water facilities in rural areas has risen
from less than 30% of the population in 1994 to slightly more than 50% in 2005, and
local capacity exists to undertake water and sanitation civil works and to manage and
operate facilities. Urban Water supply coverage is currently estimated at 58%. The
approach to urban water delivery is based on a utility model, with tariffs regulated by
an independent regulator. Inefficiencies in the management of services and big
losses of revenue resulted in the under-performance of the urban water sub-sector
and led to a Government decision in 2006 to turn to a private service provider (PSP)
to manage the production and distribution of water. Absence of a comprehensive
national water policy and water sector implementation plan has constrained scale up
in the sector, and lack of harmonized implementation approaches among DPs has
reduced efficiency.

With regard to sanitation services, the Joint Monitoring Program for Water Supply
and Sanitation of UNICEF and WHO report an effective average access rate to
improved sanitation facilities of 18% at the national level. Implementation of the
Environmental Sanitation Policy (1999) has faced considerable difficulties, posed by
institutional problems and technical and financial capacity in the sub-sector. The low
sanitation coverage requires innovative and sustainable approaches to latrine
promotion and financing. Costs related to mortality and morbidity from poor water
supply, sanitation and hygiene practices amount to 2.1 % of GDP.
Urbanization in Ghana is accelerating. In 2000, the level of urbanization in Ghana
stood at 44%, and this is expected to increase to 58% by 203028. Nearly 34% of the
urban population lives in Accra (estimated to be 3.2 million people) and in Kumasi
(estimated to be 0.8 million). These two cities account for almost 20% of Ghana’s
GDP *’, while the Greater Accra region alone accounts for 51% of manufacturing
activity in Ghana 30. For cities like Accra and Kumasi, infrastructure investments are
essential to their growth and progress. However, investments have not kept pace
with the rapid urbanization underway, which is resulting in traffic congestion,
environmental sanitation problems, and institutional/governance challenges for urban
residents and local authorities.
Gender disparities are steadily declining in some areas of basic service
provision, such as in primary education, where Ghana has almost achieved gender
parity. However, in areas such as reproductive health and water provision, they
remain high and burdensome. While these problems are being addressed through a
range of interventions by government and social institutions, Ghana has far to go in
significantly reducing such disparities, especially in the poorest regions.
Progress towards the MDGs

Table 3 shows that Ghana’s progress towards the MDGs has been steady but not
transformational. Achieving a transformational change consistent with Ghana’s
aspiration to be a middle-income country will depend on consistently improved
service delivery across the public sector and outreach to non-state actors through
public-private partnerships.

3. Goals and Challenges
3.1 The National Development Strategy - GPRS II
Ghana’s first national Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS I) was finalised in 2002
with the aim of generating growth, controlling inflation and increasing expenditure on
programmes targeting the poorest and most vulnerable in society. While much of the
government‘s macroeconomic agenda was achieved during the GPRS I period
(2003-2005), reviews noted little room in the GPRS for addressing high-growth
issues, as well as weak attention to gender equality, inclusion and social protection.
A second generation GPRS was produced by government3’ in late 2005, with an
ambitious overarching goal of raising average per capita income levels to middleincome levels by 2015, Le., from about US$400 to about US$ 1,000. The GPRS II
(2006-2009) is an agriculture-led strategy which seeks to diversify the economy’s
structure from traditional cocoa to cereals and other cash crops for export markets.
Other sectors considered to have long-term potential include: tourism, information
and communication technologies, light industry based on textiles and garments, and
value-added to minerals. The GPRS II emphasizes policies to promote equitable
growth that will be sustainable over the medium to long term.
GPRS II presents its strategies and actions according to three thematic pillars:
Private Sector Competitiveness; Human Resource Development; and
Governance and Civic Responsibility. Development partners consider that the
GPRS II, together with the recommendations of the APRM, provides an acceptable
basis for aligning support over the short to medium term. However, the GPRS II
would provide an even better framework for programming of external assistance
were there greater strategic depth in the discussion of trade-offs, a more credible
costing of GPRS II priority programs, and a robust results framework.
If Ghana is to continue its record of strong macro-economic performance and
achieve its goal of reaching middle-income status by 2015, including the fulfilment of
all the MDGs, a number of constraints and challenges across the three GPRS pillars
will need to be resolved in the short to medium term. These challenges are
presented in the following section.

3.2 Challenges and Strategic Priorities
Cross-sectoral challenges
Maintaining sound macroeconomic management and budget governance
and improved management of domestic and external resources are essential
for sustainable growth and poverty reduction. Without a strong domestic
revenue base and effective management of official and private resource flows,
achieving an accelerated growth target will be significantly more difficult.
1

31

Tackling poverty disparities will require targeted interventions to address
growing inequities between and within regions, gender disparities in access to
resources, services and infrastructure amenities, and the effects of long term
natural resource depletion. Such action will be necessary if Ghana’s human

development indicators are to improve significantly and contribute to economic
performance.

.

Sharing the benefits of growth is important because growing inequality and
unsustainable growth paths have the potential to lead to political strife and
conflict, as has been demonstrated in neighboring countries. Shared growth
can happen in two ways. One is through ensuring that everyone has the same
economic opportunities so that they can make a decent living and, thereby
contribute to growth over time. The second is to put in place redistributive
measures so that people who will not be able to work are ensured a minimum
standard of living.
Improving the quality and productivity of all public expenditure is an
urgent cross-sectoral priority, particularly in view of the need for enhanced
financing of infrastructure investments to underpin growth. With current
considerable domestic resource mobilisation and more DP resources flowing
directly into the government budget, it is essential that Government tests for
efficiency and value for money in public expenditure and insists on
accountability for all public monies.
Absorbing large external inflows without compromising the competitiveness of the export sectorwill require a strong drive to enhance the productivity of private sector investments and improve the productivity of public sector
spending overall. On the latter point, Ghana’s need to finance large infrastructure investments to provide a platform for growth could lead to an expansion of
non-concessional borrowing and a weakening in the country’s debt sustainability position, if concessional funds are not available to respond to needs.
Accelerating decentralization is key to improving citizens’ participation in
development. If service delivery is to be improved and become more responsive to local priorities, the Government needs to step up the implementation of
its National Decentralisation Action Plan, adopt a comprehensive decentralisation policy and strategy, make progress regarding the political decentralization
process, and ensure that functions and resources are transferred from MDAs to
districts.
Managing the effects of rapid urbanization in a way that is equitable and has
positive poverty reduction impacts will require a well-functioning infrastructure
network, a transparent regulatory environment with increased emphasis on
coordinated urban planning, and a sound municipal governance/finance
system. Bringing these factors together will create an enabling environment for
private sector development.
Reinforcing high-level coordination and dialogue to mainstream
environment is critical. The implication of environmental and climatic factors
for economic growth and the trade-offs that may be required across sectors
need to be assessed systematically and routinely. Policy, regulatory, and
incentive frameworks relating to environmental management are complex, and
overlapping institutional mandates and outdated legislative measures can lead
to conflicts in interpretation and program implementation. An immediate need
exists to strengthen intersectoral coordination mechanisms to foster
sustainable growth.

15

February 2007

G-JAS

In addition to these cross-sectoral challenges, G-JAS DPs have identified a number
of strategic priorities at the pillar and sector level which will inform their assistance
and dialogue with the government over the G-JAS period.
Pillar One: Private Sector Competitiveness

The GPRS II places private sector-led development at the forefront to achieve higher
and more broadly based growth. Modernization of agriculture and linkages to industry
are seen as central to the structural transformation of the economy that will be
needed to sustain higher growth and drive poverty reduction. A broad range of
efforts will be needed to remove constraints related to sustainability and shared
Strategic priorities across the pillar include:
improving the enabling environment for business, including trade and financial
services,
facilitating stronger regional integration to stimulate productivity and trade
links,
enabling agricultural producers to improve productivity, diversify crops, and
expand production for exports,
improving access to land and security of property rights, particularly for
women farmers,
managing Ghana's natural resources in a sustainable and transparent way,
scaling up investment in energy generation and distribution and in transport
infrastructure, and
creating the environment for more competitive and lower cost ICT services.
Business environment

Ghana's business environment is becoming one of the most favourable on the
continent, but improving the enabling environment for businesses of all sizes, and
particularly outside the main urban areas, continues to be a major challenge.
Priorities for government action include simplifying procedures for business start up,
allowing greater competition in the financial sector, facilitating land title and property
registration including reducing gender differentials in access to land and credit, and
strengthening the legal rights of creditors. Increasing investment, strengthening
business linkages, and generating employment are major tasks for the private sector.
Implementing the Trade Sector Support Programme and the Financial Sector
Strategic Plan are essential to improve access to international markets and to
financial services. Widening access to credit and affordable business development
services is critical for enabling small and medium scale enterprises to develop.
Trade

Accelerating growth of regional markets will require greater integration of transport
and communication systems among ECOWAS countries and increased
harmonisation of fiscal and regulatory policies. ECOWAS efforts to put in place
common external tariffs and custom facilitation measures will enhance trade and
regional integration. Regional programmes such as the forthcoming Economic
Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the EU and USAlD's West Africa Trade Hub could
be instrumental in facilitating stronger regional integration and contributing to address
supply-side and competitiveness constraints.

Agriculture

Central to the diversification and expansion of exports needed to achieve and sustain
higher economic growth is the modernisation of agriculture which will, in turn, spur
pro-poor growth beyond the sector itself. These growth linkages are vital in a sector
that has the highest proportion of workers in households in the two lowest welfare
quintiles. The priority for a growth with poverty reduction strategy is therefore to take
measures that enable poor producers, many of them women, to improve their
productivity, market access and incomes alongside those with more commercial
advantages, while at the same time sustaining their natural assets such as land (see
Box 2) by scaling-up sustainable land management practices. Strategic priorities
include strengthening rural infrastructure, especially rural roads and irrigation,
improving land tenure, promoting promising value chains, enhancing access to credit
for women and men by strengthening rural financial institutions, and strengthening
the provision and targeting of agricultural research and extension services.

1

Box I: Differential Access to Land

!

Land ownership by households and their members is the exception rather than the rule.
Less than one third (31%) of households headed by women own land. The land allocation
process is often biased against women; fewer women obtain land; women consistently
have smaller and in some cases less fertile plots; and they often hold land on less secure
terms than men. All of these factors reduce agricultural productivity. Gender differentials
in access to and control of land are often a result of inheritance rules, marital residence
and land use patterns, as well as life cycle changes. Unequal land rights sustain and
reproduce female poverty and exclusion.

Natural Resources and Environmental Management

Sustainable management of natural resources and environment is also urgent.
Priorities include: reforming and building capacity of key regulatory agencies (for
fisheries, minerals, forestry and environmental protection) to help them adapt and
fulfill their mandates as subvented agencies; improving positive linkages between
extractive industries and local communities; regularizing and assisting the related
informal and artisanal sectors within a participatory framework; improving budget
formulation and execution as well as public financial management; strengthening
oversight capacity; and enhancing coordination mechanisms among regulatory
agencies.
Infrastructure

Much of Ghana's desire to accelerate growth rests on a substantial scaling up of
investment in new infrastructure, including efforts to strengthen the regulatory and
institutional framework to attract more private sector participation, and efforts to
improve efficiency and absorptive capacity. A significant part of the challenge also
lies in substantially improving the management of existing infrastructure, including
maintenance needs. Meeting the infrastructure challenge requires a fully integrated
infrastructure platform and critical attention by government to the effective combining
of public and private sector investments, prioritisation processes and value-formoney tests.

Transport

Improved transport links are critical to improvements in market access, factor
productivity, and export performance as well as to enhancing Ghana’s position as a
regional transport hub and corridor in West Africa. Priorities include: achieving a
better balance between investment and expenditure on maintenance; providing
better links between rural areas and markets and service centers through rural feeder
roads; improving regional trade routes; upgrading ports to minimize delays and
developing interchange facilities for passengers and freight; improving security and
safety to international standards; and strengthening sector management through an
integrated transport policy and strategic plan.
Energy

With rising demand and constrained supply, energy infrastructure needs to be
significantly upgraded and expanded if the sector is not to act as a serious brake on
future growth. Critical priorities include completing the power sector reform (including
a management services contract for the Electricity Company of Ghana, ECG),
expanding generation capacity to meet demand growth, stemming losses in the
distribution system, setting retail and bulk tariffs at cost recovery levels, and adopting
a new energy policy that sets out a clear institutional framework for the sustainable
expansion of access. Complementary action is called for to promote the efficient use
of energy, gradual transition from fuelwood to modern energy (including renewable
sources), and regional power sharing arrangements.
Telecom/lnformation Communication Technology

International competitiveness increasingly depends on high speed, low-cost
communications. In the Ghana context, there is a need for more competitive and
lower cost ICT services through tighter regulation in the short term, development of a
national broad-band fibre-optic network, and an improved institutional framework for
promoting private sector participation, especially in the development of a robust
information technology industry. Opportunities for private sector operators to enter
into partnership with Government to develop e-government applications are now
being explored and offer potential for cost-effective roll-out of virtual services.
Pillar 2: Human Resource Development

The GPRS II places emphasis on expanding services to meet the MDGs and
developing a healthy and skilled labour force to support higher growth and structural
change. While progress has been made in expanding services in health, education,
and water and sanitation, quality improvements lag behind. Attention to quality is vital
to achieving and sustaining outcome improvements in learning, life expectancy, and
child and maternal mortality. Addressing gender inequalities in school enrolment and
access to health services is also essential to meet MDG targets and encourage
stronger participation by women in the growth and development process. A
commitment to social protection is likewise an essential part of delivering on a high
and sustainable growth path.
Strategic priorities across the pillar as a whole include:

..

enhancing the quality and efficiency of basic service delivery,
improved targeting of services and preventative activities to underserved
areas and vulnerable groups,

18

February 2007

G-JAS

ensuring financial sustainability in service delivery and social protection
measures,
clarifying roles and responsibilities of line ministries and district governments
and ensuring effective flow of funds to district levels, and
focusing on the role of education and health in raising productive capacity of
the labour force.
Education

Priorities in the education sector include achieving Universal Primary Enrolment and
full completion in primary education, expanding enrolment at post-primary levels,
promoting gender parity in secondary school enrolment, improving the quality of
teaching and learning at all levels, and improving the relevance of post-basic
education. The role of private providers as well as private financing also needs to be
strengthened. Reforming tertiary education financing needs to assure sustainable
growth, diversification and improve accountability. Further priorities include an
emphasis on science and technology, especially ICTs in education, and a greater
focus on skills development and training, including technical and vocational
education and training, as a means of human resource development in line with the
GPRS II growth agenda.
Health

Priorities in the health sector are focused on achieving significant declines in the
rates of maternal and child mortality (in particular neo-natal mortality) by improving
equitable access to quality basic health and nutrition services. Reproductive health
interventions, with a particular focus on youth/adolescents, are likewise important
and will lead to better health outcomes and a reduction in population growth. Malaria
control is a continuing priority in light of its significant impact on economic growth and
on child mortality. Collaboration with non-state service providers will increase
effectiveness and efficiency of ‘close to client‘ delivery of a high impact service
package. Improved management of human resources will be necessary if quality of
services is to be improved, including policies to address the impact of health staff
brain-drain. Likewise, consolidating the financial viability of the National Health
Insurance Scheme will be a key element to ensuring the sustainability of health
service delivery. Lastly, intersectoral collaboration beyond the limits of the “health
sector” will be needed to promote health and attack the underlying causes of
morbidity (in particular by linking with water and sanitation, environment, education,
infrastructure, and agriculture/food security).
HIV/AIDS

Prevention efforts in the past have led to high levels of awareness and good
knowledge about HIVIAIDS and other sexually transmitted infections. However,
misconceptions still exist, risk perceptions are low, and adoption of preventative
behaviours is still limited. Improving the level and targeting of prevention activities
towards specific groups and geographical areas with high prevalence rates and risky
behaviours needs to be intensified. Stigma and discrimination faced by people living
with the virus urgently need to be reduced, alongside scaling-up anti-retroviral
combination therapy for people with advanced HIV.
Water and Sanitation

Key priorities include approval of the National Water Policy and revision of the
Sanitation Policy, as well as preparation of related implementation frameworks.
19

February 2007

G-JAS

Prioritized investment plans for urban water, rural water, and sanitation are needed to
provide a solid framework for scaled-up funding to the water supply and sanitation
(WSS) sector. Strengthening of the institutional framework is needed to provide
guidance for harmonisation and alignment of DP implementation approaches. Such
strengthening is needed at the national level so that the sector ministry can carry out
its lead role effectively, and district capacity development will also be needed, as
District Assemblies take on increased responsibilities. Funding for rural water
investments needs to be doubled if the MDG target of 73% coverage of the rural
population is to be met by 201 5 33, with an increasing share coming from domestic
sources. With respect to urban water, challenges include strengthening Ghana
Water Company Ltd. (GWCL) capacity to effectively supervise the PSP arrangement,
integrating financial modelling into the investment planning process, increasing
investments in urban water supply to improve access, and developing pro-poor
approaches that will enable the utility to meet the needs of poor consumers.
Social Protection

Despite improving poverty trends, over 25% of the population lives in extreme
poverty. The government has committed to developing more targeted programmes,
both to act as a safety net and to provide an extra push to move them out of chronic
poverty. Government capacity needs to be developed so that it can run a welltargeted and efficient social protection programme on a national scale, which
addresses income poverty and facilitates access to basic services. The Ministry of
Manpower will need to coordinate closely with MDAs and districts to avoid parallel
programs. Interventions, such as social security payments for the elderly, for the
food insecure, or for vulnerable children, need further support.
Pillar 3: Governance and Civic Responsibility

The government has significantly improved the management of public resources in
recent years, and has made a start in attacking the backlog of broader public sector
reform issues. Although political constraints have tended to slow implementation of
systemic changes to the budget process, financial controls and budget accountability
to parliament and civil society, progress is definitely being made, as evidenced by the
Public Expenditure Financial Assessment (PEFA) and External Review of Public
Financial Management (ERPFM) process. This offers the opportunity for accelerated
reform to reach international value-for-money standards, the impact of which cannot
be over-estimated for achieving a high-growth scenario.
Cross-sectoral priorities for governance reform include:
Upgrading public expenditure and financial management, in particular
strengthening value for money structures related to public expenditure and
investment.
Reforming the civil service, with an emphasis on measuring results and
citizens participation, and improving the transparency and accountability of
government operations.

Implementing effective decentralisation to local authorities, including clear
roles and responsibilities for central and local MDAs, and sufficient resources
and responsibilities for districts to fulfil their mandates.

Strengthening the oversight capacity of non-executive bodies (Parliament and
other bodies) and the capacity of citizens and non-state actors to engage in
national development and to fight against corruption.
1

Enhancing the representation and participation by women with clearer
accountability for gender equality outcomes across government departments
and local authorities.
Improving statistical services and data analysis, enhancing their utilisation in
policy and decision making, and widening information-sharing to strengthen
social accountability.

Public Financial Management

Government introduced three laws in 2003 that combine to establish a strong
framework for public financial management and accountability. However, the financial
administration, procurement and internal audit laws are still at an early stage of
implementation, and there is much to be done to ensure they deliver their intended
outcomes. The Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MoFEP) has developed
a strategic plan which reflects challenges identified in the 2006 Review. This plan
focuses primarily on MoFEP, but there is also a need to ensure that MDAs' and
districts' public financial management and accountability systems are strengthened,
including their procurement capacity and ability to screen investments against valuefor-money criteria. Improved performance in these areas will help to limit
opportunities for corruption.
Public sector reform

Strengthening the civil and public services is a key element of the Government's
reform programme. It is essential that the reform process delivers sustained and
measurable improvements in a transparent way and with active citizens' participation.
As the impact of central-level public sector reforms take time to work through the
system, focused sector-based organisational and institutional strengthening
programmes will also be required to complement the reform agenda. Priorities for
the coming years should include: policy coordination within ministries and across
ministries; results-based management and accountability systems; civil service
training; reform of central management agencies; overhaul of the public sector pay
and pensions, with the aim of achieving consolidation and monetization of salary
components and elimination of all non-monetary benefits and allowances; and
development of a comprehensive human resources management strategy that would
define clear career progressions and management functions within the civil service
(including new career streams such as procurement and information technology).
Strengthening oversight capacity

According to Ghana's constitution and legislation, non-executive bodies are
mandated to exercise strong oversight over the executive, but their performance of
these functions is often limited in practice. For example, staffing and overall funding
constraints have limited the scope and depth of scrutiny that Parliament and its
standing committees can give. The Ghana Audit Service has improved its capacity to
provide financial accountability but has not yet focused on evaluations of outcomes.
Priorities for the future should therefore include expanding support to these
institutions so that they can deliver their full mandate. Ghana's political traditions
provide space for civil society organisations to comment on government
performance, and there is additional scope for government to encourage civil society
21

February 2007

G-JAS

involvement in public policy formulation and implementation. Capacity development
is needed for civil society organisations to build stronger coalitions, strengthen links
with grass-roots groups, participate in development dialogues at different levels of
governance (including the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative, EITI), monitor
delivery of public goods, and hold government accountable for corrupt practices.
Ensuring Gender Equity and Empowering Women

Ghana has committed to ensuring gender equality and women's empowerment by
signing a number of international agreements (CEDAW 1981, 2004 Solemn
Declaration), but implementation on the ground has been slow. Priority actions
include providing the Ministry of Women and Children's Affairs (MOWAC) with
adequate financial resources and good quality staff to carry out its mandate of
working with other MDAs and local government to mainstream gender into their
policies, programs, and budgets. Government as a whole needs to more strongly
drive MDA capacity development interventions related to gender analysis and gender
sensitive programming. Enforcement of pending legislation, such as the Domestic
Violence Bill, will also require concerted efforts across a range of MDAs. Finally,
MOWAC and civil society, working with the Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) and
NDPC, need to develop their capacity to monitor and evaluate how well Ghana is
doing in implementing its gender policies, domestic law, international agreements,
and the APRM recommendations.
Managing for Results

In line with the GPRS I Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) plan, the government has
produced an Annual Progress Report (APR) each year since 2003, to report on
GPRS policy implementation and make policy recommendations to feed into the
budget process. In addition to the APR, five Poverty and Social Impact Assessments
(PSIAs) have been completed. There is increasing demand for timely and quality
M&E from central Government, including Office of the President, Cabinet and
Parliament. Dissemination of information has been limited historically, but this
situation is changing, with the launch of Ghanalnfo and operationalising the NDPC
website. The GSS is in the process of setting up a Data Centre where electronic data
on various surveys can be easily accessed.
The main challenges in this area relate to the need for capacity development at all
levels. Some of the problems that persist relate to issues of staff retention and
motivation, while others relate to defining clear institutional priorities (in work
programmes) and coordinating donor support. Completing prioritized programmes of
work has proven difficult, and domestic demand and support have been insufficient to
press for necessary changes. As noted above, the dissemination culture is changing
towards a more open regime, although there is still a need to widen access to
information and strengthen social accountability, especially outside central circles in
Accra. To address these challenges, it will be important for central and line
institutions (eg, Office of the President, MOFEP, GSS, NDPC, and MDAs) to prepare
action plans aimed at resolving M&E related constraints and for DPs to provide
coordinated support for their implementation. District-level M&E capacity will also
need attention.

4. Working Together
Ghana faces a crucial opportunity to step-up its national development effort to
achieve the MDGs and make progress towards middle-income status. But, as
discussed in Chapter 3, there are major challenges along the way requiring
concerted efforts across the Government and strengthened partnerships with private
sector institutions and civil society organisations. This backdrop increases the
importance of development partners working together effectively, both to support
Government's efforts at increased coordination and to increase the overall impact of
assistance on GPRS II goals. The G-JAS is a significant step forward in this
direction.

4. I Strategic Principles and Commitments
The G-JAS seeks to fully align partner activities with GPRS II and to formalise the
GPS. As described in Section 1.1, the GPS Results Matrix provides the overall
framework for how DPs support Ghana to achieve measurable outcomes in
accordance with GPRS II. The GPS also includes a rolling Harmonization and Aid
Effectiveness Plan (G-HAP) based on the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. GJAS partners are fully committed to taking forward the G-HAP in partnership with
Government and civil society.

To boost progress, G-JAS partners have identified a set of strategic principles and
commitments drawn from the G-HAP, to drive their harmonization and aid
effectiveness efforts forward during G-JAS implementation. The broad strategic
principles that G-JAS partners will observe in their assistance programs are to:

0

0

increase their use of common arrangements to plan, deliver and monitor their
development assistance,
work through pillar and sector working groups to share information and, as far as
possible, plan policy dialogue, financial support, and technical assistance with
each other, with the government, with civil society and private sector groups,
aim to use country systems to manage and implement their assistance, and seek
to strengthen these systems in a coordinated way, and
focus on the achievement of results through nationally driven M&E frameworks
and support evidence-based decision-making through strengthened national
statistics and systems for M&E.

The commitments that G-JAS partners have made as part of the G-HAP are
summarised in Figure 2 to facilitate ease of reference and to highlight those elements
that G-JAS DPs can actively influence. G-JAS partners plan to set specific targets
for these commitments early in the G-JAS cycle. Implementation and reporting
against these commitments will take place as part of the G-HAP process, in the
context of the CG/APM meeting each June.

4.2

Working Smarter

Development partners are already working together through a range of coordinated
programmes and common arrangements. Progress is variable, in part because of the
lack of fully developed strategies and results frameworks in a number of sectors, the
absence of clearly prioritised annual work plans, and the absence of a clearly
articulated aid policy in which the government sets out its preferences for working

with DPs at central, sector and local government levels. Through the G-JAS process,
DPs will be looking to advance dialogue with the government on these issues.

Pillar and Sector Working Groups
Government and DPs recognise that there is an urgent need to improve the crosssector dialogue at the GPRS II pillar level. Many constraints at the sector level can
only be overcome by concerted action in other sectors. Appropriate modalities are
under discussion and will be clarified in the coming months.
At sector level, progress with coordinated working is most advanced in the context of
Multi-Donor Budget Support (MDBS), private sector development, transport, health,
education, HIV/AIDS, and decentralisation, with emerging good practice in financial
sector reform, agriculture, water and sanitation, natural resources management,
social protection, and monitoring and evaluation. This good practice involves inter
alia: clear leadership of the sector working group by the government; aligning DP
assistance with a sector strategy, and, where possible, including it in the national
budget process; streamlining monitoring and reporting procedures around a common
results framework; and pursuing joint policy dialogue and analytical work in
partnership with government.
Box 2: Sector Working in PSD and Water Sanitation

In the Private Sector Development sector working group, the main focus for DP
alignment is the Government's Private Sector Development Strategy and associated
comprehensive work plan. Oversight of the work plan is provided by a joint GovernmentPrivate Sector Oversight Committee, and a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) sets
out how the government and DPs will engage to support delivery of the sector strategy
and work plan. Currently 12 out of 20 DPs have signed the MOU and either joined a
pooled fund arrangement or aligned their project support closely with the strategy and
work plan. It is hoped that more DPs will sign the MOU with more support made available
either in the pool or on-budget in the near term.
In Water and Sanitation, DP support is large relative to the Government budget, thus
DPs are working closely with the government to strengthen the sector policy framework for
both government and DP financed investments. DPs are funding a study of ongoing
harmonisation and alignment efforts in the sector with a view to recommend steps to
improve joint working and enhance the impact of assistance. Denmark and the
Netherlands are using common arrangements for managing their funds for water and
sanitation investments that are channelled through the Ministry of Local Government,
Rural Development, and Environment.

To capture these good practices and improve upon them further, a discussion paper
was shared with Government in June 2006 which proposed that the pillar and sector
working group architecture be rationalized to improve coordination and create a
stronger platform for engagement around GPRS II priorities. Under this proposal,
some sector groups would be consolidated, and a mechanism for promoting policy
dialogue within a pillar would be put in place to enable cross-sectoral synergies and
impacts to be addressed. Sector groups would operate according to a common
standard, with transparent criteria for the selection of Government and DP sector
leads. Civil society and private representatives would participate in core sector group
activities, such as the annual sector review. A joint Government-DP working group
reviewed and improved upon the original proposals, and forwarded its recommendations in December 2006 for consideration at the Ministerial level. Adoption of the

25

G-JAS

February 2007

improved protocols and dissemination to MDAs for implementation would represent
an important step towards a clearer division of responsibilities and increased
coordination at sector level.
Harmonisation and Reduced Transactions Costs

One area where parallel practices by DPs have caused some difficulty over the years
has been the payment of allowances and per diems to Government staff. The
ultimate preference of the DP community is to align project funding with the
government policy framework. However this is not yet feasible as public sector
reform has not yet dealt with this issue, and practices have emerged that distort
government remuneration and travel policy frameworks. In June 2006, therefore,
DPs decided to adopt a joint approach to allowances and local travel per diems as an
interim standardisation mechanism, pending revision of the Government
remuneration and travel policy framework. G-JAS DPs will adhere to the common
practices and allowance rates defined in the joint letter to Government, and
implementation will be monitored periodically.
To improve harmonised working and lower transaction costs, some development
partners have begun to share technicaVadvisory resources or manage funds for one
another (Box 3). There are also a number of joint analyses and joint capacity
development activities. For example, in the area of Natural Resources and
Environmental Management, a joint approach is emerging supported by a joint
Country Environmental Analysis (CEA) funded by the World Bank, DFID, RNE, and
AFD. The EC is also using the CEA in the preparation of its Environmental Profile.
Analytic work in the transport sector is jointly planned and reviewed by DPs and the
government, as are selected interventions in the water sector. DPs undertake joint
external reviews of public financial management every 18 months, and are currently
participating in a joint evaluation of the MDBS.
Box 3: Silent Partnerships

‘Silent’ or ‘delegated’ partnerships between DPs take on different forms in different
settings. They can involve an agreement between two (or more) DPs to share
technicaVadvisory resources in order to represent one another in policy dialogue (often
called ‘silent‘ partnership). They can also involve one DP managing the financial
contribution to a programme or project of another partner (sometimes called delegated
contribution). The value of such partnerships is two-fold. First, they reduce the number
of DPs around the policy table and make technical coordination simpler, and second,
they facilitate the promotion of common understandings and positions among DPs.
Currently DFlD and the Netherlands share a sector advisor in health, and DFlD and the
EC share an advisor in transport. Proposals for additional silent partnerships exist
between ClDA and DFlD in the agricultural sector and between the EC, Netherlands
and DFlD in education. Currently DFlD support to the water sector is being managed by
Denmark and GDCIKNV, although DFlD maintains a presence in policy dialogue in the
sector.
Further efforts to reduce the transactions costs of aid management include the
decision reached prior to the 2006 CG/APM to institute a national mission free period
(MFP). The MFP (September 15 to November 15) coincides with the finalisation of
the national budget (a crucial time for Government) and commits DPs to not launch
missions that would engage government colleagues in programming discussions,
policy dialogue, or analytical work. 2006 was the first year during which an MFP

26

February 2007

G-JAS

operated, and this innovation was a critical step in ensuring that DP mission planning
is fully aligned with the Government’s budget cycle.
Aid Delivery and Predictabilify

The CG/APM meeting is an important process element in improving aid predictability
as it is timed to precede the kick-off of the annual budget cycle and provide an
updated picture of rolling resource flows for Government planning. The evolution of
the CGlAPM from a periodic pledging session to an annual forum for reviewing
GPRS results, external resource flows, and mutual harmonisation commitments
represents an important step forward in the partnership relationship in Ghana. The
overview of actual and projected disbursements by GPRS II pillar, sector, and DP
provides a simple but powerful tool to monitor priorities. Integrating government
spending into this tool would enhance assessment and planning.
The government indicated in the 2005 CG/APM communiquk its preference for an
increased use of budget support and sector wide approaches for assisting the GPRS.
G-JAS partners will seek to respond to this preference. Progress will depend on
whether a clear aid policy is in place; credible sector strategies have been
developed; and country systems are steadily being strengthened.
Predictability in financing has already substantially improved through the MDBS,
which is now in the position of making pre-budget funding commitments, and a
number of coherent sector programmes are now operating. DPs are looking to further
improve predictability, and the 4 year focus of the G-JAS is one way to achieve this.
Further efforts to improve predictability also depend on improvements in Government
prioritisation, medium term budgeting, value-for-money tests, and external resource
management.
In terms of preferred aid modalities, all active budget support donors are included in
the G-JAS process. In selected cases partners are already planning to provide as
much as 70 percent of their support through general and sector budget support
instruments. However, further progress in this regard crucially depends on
government implementing improvements to the policy framework and strengthening
country systems for public financial management amongst other things. G-JAS
partners using programme and project funding instruments will also align these with
sector strategies and programmes.

5. Our Joint Response
5.1

Indicative Trends

G-JAS Partners project financial flows for the 2007-2010 period of US$ 5.3 billion, of
which two thirds would be provided on a grant basis and one third on a concessional
credit basis. Of the assistance flowing to the government sector, US$ 1.4 billion is
expected to be in the form of budget support and US$ 3.9 billion to be provided for
sectoral programs. It is expected that the breakdown of sector level assistance will be
on the order of US$ 2.3 billion for Pillar I, US$ 1.2 billion for Pillar 2, and US$ 368
million for Pillar 3. Direct support to civil society is projected at about $58 million over
the G-JAS period. It should be emphasized that many DPs are not able to make
projections for the whole four year period and that these numbers are provided to
give an indication of trends, subject to the qualification noted above.

Focusing our assistance

The G-JAS Partners will support priority action areas identified in the GPRS II and in
the APRM through sector and cross-sector programmes and projects. This section
describes where G-JAS partners expect to focus their assistance during 2007-1 0,
with a commitment to programme new assistance within this common framework.
Detailed information on G-JAS partner mapping at the sector level and expected
evolution over time is presented in Annexes 2 and 3, respectively.

February 2007

G-JAS

Pillar 1: Private Sector Competitiveness (US$ 2.3 billion)
G-JAS partners will provide ongoing support for implementation of the trade sector
program and the private sector development (PSD) strategy to improve Ghana’s
access to regional and global markets and improve the business and investment
climate for private sector investors. Specific areas include improved service quality
and timely delivery of PSD-related public services with a particular focus on micro-,
small, and medium enterprises; an improved legal and regulatory framework for
business and investment; trade facilitation; a more diversified and accessible
financial sector through implementation of the financial sector strategic plan; and
expansion of high quality, low cost ICT services through improvements in the
enabling environment. Sector-wide approaches (SWAPS)for PSD and financial
sector development (FSD) are in place and will provide the framework for
coordinating external assistance in these areas.
To promote the productivity and diversification of agriculture and rural non-farm
growth, G-JAS partners will support the development of a SWAP framework focusing
on enhancing the productivity of crops, livestock and aquaculture and land resources,
improving food security and expanding vital infrastructure including irrigation and
supply chain development. To promote rural development more generally, partners
are supporting sector reforms and investments in rural roads and energy and
measures to promote micro-finance institutions and the tourism sector. Analytical
work relating to land tenure, biosafety regulations, capacity development of microfinance institutions and improving access to finance for micro-, small, and medium
enterprises will help guide work in this area.

To sustain growth and poverty reduction, G-JAS partners will pursue opportunities to
provide harmonized support to natural resources and environmental governance in
line with emerging government priorities for fisheries, forestry and wildlife, mining and
overall environmental protection. G-JAS support will focus on regulatory institutions,
related artisanal activities, engagement with non-State actors, strengthening the
oversight capacity of non-executive bodies, public financial management, and linking
with global initiatives to which Ghana is committed on extractive industries, forest
governance and trade, and illegal fishing. Support to measures towards minimising
the impact of climate variability and change will also be initiated.
As a vital input to higher and more widely shared growth, G-JAS partners will
prioritise their support according to an integrated transport strategy and Transport
Sector Development Programme with an emphasis on: enhanced maintenance;
increased access to market through improvement in rural feeder roads; improved
circulation and transit times in urban centers; improved transport links critical to West
Africa regional trade; and increased use of private financing across the sector. The
sector group is reviewing how to enhance the sectoral programmatic framework
applying to both domestic and external funding.
In energy, the priority for G-JAS partners is to continue supporting implementation of
power sector reforms to improve the sector’s financial viability, and to expand the
supply of energy services while protecting the poor. In addition, G-JAS partners will
support the West.Africa Power Pool and West African Gas Pipeline Projects, scalingup access to clean, modern energy for households and public facilities, expansion of
generation, and improving operation of the power system. Analytical work will
provide needed analysis and an outline of an energy regulatory framework. The
transition to clean fuel sources for household energy use is expected to contribute to
reduced respiratory infections and improved health status among the population in
general, and children in particular.

G-JAS

Pillar 2: Human Resource Development (US$ 1.2 billion)
The GPRS II emphasises the centrality of Human Resource Development to the
achievement of faster and shared economic growth. G-JAS partners will support the
government's efforts to enhance the role of the education, health, and water/
sanitation sectors in raising the productive capacity of the population, enabling them
to work more effectively in the productive sectors of the economy.
In support of improved educational outcomes and accelerated achievement of the
MDGs, the G-JAS partners will focus on increasing access, completion and quality in
basic education, particularly the six-year cycle of primary schooling, and specific
measures, such as incentive schemes, to increase girls' enrolment, retention and
completion, particularly in secondary education. G-JAS partners will work with the
Ministries of Education and Finance to improve efficiency and equity in education
financing at all levels, particularly in pursuit of a more sustainable and equitable
system of funding for tertiary education. Partners are working with government to
develop a SWAP within which support will be provided.
In health, G-JAS support will focus on increasing access to basic health and nutrition
services for the poor; strengthening reproductive health care and linking it with HIV/
AIDS control; and establishing sustainable financing arrangements with protection of
the poor. The desired result is to improve neonatal, infant, and maternal mortality
trends. Greater efficiency and higher health worker productivity will be promoted
through a better mix of skills, equipment, transport, communication, and commodities. Delivery of a high impact yielding services package will be supported through
the steady expansion in underserved areas of the network of health centres and
district hospitals, gradually extended by community based health planning services
compounds. Evidence based learning and planning will be enabled by a
comprehensive Health Management Information System, supplemented by policy
related research. Regulation of the health and nutrition sector will be a relatively
small but important aspect of G-JAS support. G-JAS partners will give priority to
strengthening the SWAP arrangement and its effective linkage to the MDBS
framework, with particular attention to the governance agenda, including
decentralisation and public financial management.

To reduce the impact of HIVIAIDS, G-JAS partners will continue to support enhanced
management of the HIV/AIDS response, increased targeting of prevention
intervention, and scaling up of the provision of antiretroviral combination therapy for
people with advanced HIV. Partner support is currently channeled through common
arrangements in support of the Government's Universal Response programme,
coordinated by the Ghana Aids Commission. In an environment of increasing budget
support, opportunities for pooled funding and for integrating HIV/AIDS control
measures into governmentkector ministries' work programs will be pursued (relevant
elements of universal access).
On water and sanitation, G-JAS partners will support the implementation of the
National Water Policy and the Strategic Investment Plan for Rural Water, with plans
to develop a SWAP. In line with the decentralisation process and in parallel to the
reinforcement of district capacities, their interventions will be directed to and
implemented by District Assemblies. In addition G-JAS partners will support the
updating and implementation of the Strategic Investment Plan for Urban Water and
the National Sanitation Policy. To enhance sustainable management of water
resources, partners will seek the development of a National Integrated Water
Resources Management plan.
30

G-JAS

February 2007

G-JAS partners will support implementation of the National Social Protection Strategy
by providing co-ordinated support for capacity development of the Ministry of
Manpower and for the design and implementation of new programmes, and financial
assistance in scaling these up nationally. G-JAS partners will work with the
government to refine poverty targeting of protection programmes.

Pillar 3: Good Governance and Civic Responsibility ( U S 3 6 8 million)
To further strengthen democratic practice and public accountability G-JAS partners
will provide support to oversight, human rights, and justice institutions.

G-JAS partners will support decentralisation reforms through the National
Decentralization Action Plan. On the basis of a comprehensive decentralization
policy and implementation strategy, G-JAS partners will seek to develop a coherent
and coordinated support modality. Partners aim to move towards harmonized support
for capacity development of local governments and the delivery of local public
services, and towards harmonized arrangements for district development funding. To
address urbanization challenges, support would focus on developing well-functioning
infrastructure networks, transparent regulatory environments, and sound municipal
governancelfinance systems (particularly for those districts that are classified as
municipalities or metropolitan areas). It is the understanding of the G-JAS partners
that support to sector or cross-cutting programs at district level will be fully aligned
with the objectives and implementation arrangements of the decentralization agenda.
Support for the government’s Public Sector Reform Strategy will continue via multiple
initiatives including economic management capacity development, support for
pensions reform, and use of e-government applications to improve service delivery
and increased productivity in the public service. Some DPs are participating in a
pooled mechanism for a SWAP, and the intent is to expand G-JAS partner
participation within this framework over the G-JAS period. G-JAS partners will
encourage transparency and citizen participation in the Public Sector Reform
process.
Improved interaction between Parliament, traditional authorities, and civil society
groups will be supported through coordinated DP initiatives, although mechanisms
are yet to be defined. Traditional authorities will be supported to assume a
constructive role in national development and the modern nation-state, in particular in
local land and judicial administration as well as in extra-judicial dispute settlement in
conformity to the requirements of rule-of-law and national policies. Access to
resources, justice and good local administration for women and vulnerable groups
will be supported as a matter of paramount importance. G-JAS partners will also
support initiatives that aim to increase transparency and reduce opportunities for
corruption, by strengthening the oversight capacity of non-executive institutions and
civil society organizations.
Improvements to budget formulation and execution processes and public financial
management reform will continue through MDBS support and individual DP projects
in public procurement, revenue mobilization, and debt management. Upcoming
ERPFM exercises will focus on issues Government considers critical to improving
value for money and accountability in the use of public resources, using the PEFA
PFM Performance Measurement Framework and the World Bank-OECD/DAC good
practices on strengthening procurement capacities.
G-JAS partners will support the establishment of a robust national M&E system that
generates regular reports on GPRS II implementation results and information for use
31

February 2007

G-JAS

in evidence-based decision-making. In this context, DPs will work with GoG to
enhance GSS and MDA capacity to produce reliable statistics and meaningful
analysis in a timely manner. Partners will also encourage the government to engage
civil society in its M&E efforts. Specifically, G-JAS partner support will be focused on
the NDPC, GSS, the Office of the President, and MoFEP, working within the
framework of a coordinated technical cooperation programme and prioritised
institution-specific action plans. M&E capacity-development at the MDA and district
level will also be supported within a harmonised framework.

To promote gender equality and empower women, and reach MDG 3 targets, G-JAS
partners will support government and civil society to integrate gender equity issues
and considerations into key national development documents; strengthen MOWAC in
its role as policy co-ordinator on gender as well as in its horizontal relationship with
MDAs; and advocate for a greater allocation of resources in the national budgeting
process for women’s empowerment. At the sector level, G-JAS partners will
integrate gender concerns in policy dialogue and operational support programmes
wherever appropriate and feasible.

5.3 Joint Programming Principles
To accelerate movement to joint programming during the G-JAS period, partners
have decided to apply some key principles to guide programming choices in the short
to medium term. These programming principles, which are listed below, are fully
compatible with the strategic principles listed in Figure 2. Specifically, G-JAS
partners will work within the framework of pillar and sector groups to:

define priorities for new assistance and modalities for coordination.
develop full SWAPSand programme-based aid (PBA) frameworks where they
do not yet exist.
enhance coordination and complementarity between different aid modalities
so as to maximize their combined effectiveness.
develop and deliver coordinated technical assistance programs; untying and
pooling of TA will be explored wherever desirable for achieving development
results.
consider restructuring on-going programs to enable greater alignment and
more harmonized aid delivery when new PBA frameworks come into effect.
increase predictability by making multi-year commitments wherever feasible,
and sharing projected information on financial flows and strategic planning
options with the government and DPs at least every six months.
explore opportunities for increasing the use of delegated financing
arrangements to reduce implementing agency transaction costs.

G-JAS

6. Results Framework and Risk Assessment
6.1 G-JAS Monitoring and Review
Meeting GPRS II goals and targets requires a strong focus on results by Government and
G-JAS partners, while monitoring and evaluation is essential in promoting accountability.
The G-JAS will be monitored in two ways. First, the assistance programme will be monitored
through the GPS Results Framework which maps DP assistance to GPRS II and APRM
priority actions. Second, the commitment to joint working will be monitored as part of
country-level monitoring of the Paris Declaration commitments through the G-HAP.
The G-JAS will draw on existing structures and sources as far as possible. Data sources will
include the APR of the GPRS II, the APRM Progress Review, the annual MDBS
assessment, G-HAP progress reports, Paris Declaration surveys, and, eventually, an
independent mutual accountability review.
Development results. Until the national monitoring framework for GPRS II is finalised, GJAS DPs will use the current version of the GPS results matrix for monitoring G-JAS
contributions. The matrix shows (i) GPRS outcomes, (ii) intermediate sector level indicators,
(iii) Government strategies and actions, and (iv) specific interventions of development
partners designed to contribute to the achievement of GPRS outcomes.

Once Government's GPRS II monitoring framework is finalised (expected by March 2007),
the GPS results matrix will be updated to incorporate those GPRS II indicators and national
targets which correspond to areas of G-JAS support. This will enable G-JAS partners to rely
on annual country assessments of GPRS II results to judge the development effectiveness
of the G-JAS, and avoid setting up a parallel monitoring or reporting system.
Partnership results. In addition to the annual monitoring of the development effectiveness of
G-JAS support described above, there will also be annual monitoring of the G-JAS partnership through regular G-HAP progress reports. To complement these self-assessments,
there will be a mid-term review of the G-JAS in 2008, and a full evaluation of G-JAS
commitments at completion (2010), carried out by an independent team of evaluators.
Timing. To maximise the benefits of the joint assistance strategy, monitoring and review will
be fully aligned with the GPRS II review cycle and government budget calendar (Figure 3).
The findings of the annual G-JAS review will be discussed each June during the CG/APM
meeting.

6.2

Mutual Accountability Framework

The government and DPs have committed to put in place an independent mechanism for
assessing the aid partnership as a critical input to improved mutual accountability for
development results. The purpose of an independent assessment mechanism is to
generate an objective status report on the quality of the partnership, including
recommendations for how it can be improved for the achievement of results.
G-JAS partners will engage government, civil society, and private sector partners in
identifying and evaluating options for the establishment of an independent mechanism. The
aim will be to ensure engagement of as many key stakeholders to the aid relationship as

33

February 2007

G-JAS

Major slippage in implementing GPRS I1 and APRM recommendations could undermine
confidence and reduce the ability of Ghana to maintain current aid levels and attract new
external funding. G-JAS partners will work with the government on aligning assistance to
GPRS II priorities to reduce the likelihood of such slippages. In addition, to increase the
likelihood that delays are caught early, G-JAS partners will work closely with the government
to improve the overall architecture of the aid dialogue through the creation of GPRS II pillar
structures and the strengthening of sector working groups, to complement the existing
MDBS working group. The institution of regular outcome reviews at CG/APM annual
meetings will provide an additional forum for discussing development results.
Changes in the global aid policies of DPs determined at head-quarter level could conflict
with aid effectiveness practices observed at the country level. This could lead to difficulties
in maintaining the G-JAS consensus around harmonisation issues. G-JAS partners
undertake to brief capitals on harmonisation progress in Ghana, inconsistencies in
organisational global policies and, where adverse changes in global policy occurs, to keep
in-country partners appraised of the possible consequences of these changes.

Increasing levels of support from new and emerging donors that are not aligned to the GJAS harmonisation consensus in Ghana could undermine aid effectiveness and have
adverse effects on government capacity to manage aid. G-JAS partners will encourage new
and emerging donors to participate in existing DP-government dialogue mechanisms and
will maintain an open door policy for DP coordination mechanisms.
Experience from other countries suggests that political instability or deteriorating
governance indicators could result in a breakdown in the DP consensus on how to engage
with the government. This risk is considered low given the current positive trends in political
governance in Ghana, and can be mitigated by further strengthening the policy dialogue
structures mentioned above.
Similarly, poor macroeconomic management or undue recourse to non-concessional
capital markets could result in an unravelling of the DP consensus as well as fewer
commitments of new external resources to Ghana. G-JAS partners will maintain a high level
policy dialogue on budget issues as part of the MDBS framework and at sector level as well.
With respect to non-concessional borrowing, G-JAS partners commit to assist the
government with advisory services so that market access, when it occurs, is strategic and
sustainable. The range of support anticipated includes detailed assessments of Ghana’s
investment needs based on multiple expenditure and growth scenarios; identification and
assessment of Ghana’s medium- and long-term financing options; and capacity
development related to assessing the viability of investment proposals considered for
external non-concessional borrowing.

7. Next Steps
7.1

The Way Forward

While concerted efforts to improve joint working and programming are underway, there is
still some distance to go before partner programmes are fully coordinated with one another
and aligned with sector programmes and priorities. Progress on outcomes and results will
also depend on the government moving forward with its own reform programme and
engaging actively with DPs on the harmonisation and alignment agenda.
As the G-JAS is a milestone in an on-going process rather than the end of a journey, the GJAS partners commit themselves to a series of next steps to further deepen joint working
and programming as part of G-JAS implementation:

'

.
.
.
'

.

G-JAS partners involved in the MDBS process are committed to strengthening the
multi-year performance framework (PAF), seeking both greater alignment with GPRS
II targets and greater reliance on outcome indicators. Consultations between DPs
and government on the next iteration of the MDBS PAF (2007-09) have a target
completion date of end-February 2007.
G-JAS partners commit to operationalise jointly with government the recommendations on pillar coordination and sector working groups developed by the joint
government-DP working group. The goal is to have pillar and sector groups
operating under the new guidelines by end March 2007.
G-JAS partners are committed to aligning the GPS results matrix on the final GPRS
II indicators and targets, so that full alignment is achieved. Once G-JAS partners
receive the final national indicator set (expected by end March 2007), the next steps
will involve working through the sector groups and sector leads to select which
indicators and targets are most relevant to DP assistance programs and then
revising the GPS results matrix. This process should be completed by end April
2007.
G-JAS partners plan to translate the partnership commitments contained in the GJAS into concrete targets for 2010. The next steps in this process will be to review
the country-specific targets generated by the 2006 Paris Declaration baseline survey
to assess whether these should become the G-JAS targets or if there are additional
actions or higher achievement levels that the group wish to consider. The goal is to
have a proposal ready for endorsement by the June 2007 CG/APM meeting.
G-JAS partners and government committed ourselves at the June 2006 CG/APM to
develop a framework for independent monitoring of the aid partnership in Ghana.
The next steps involve forming a joint group to define what should be monitored, how
frequently, who should do the monitoring, and how civil society and the private sector
should be involved. The working group will be formed in early 2007, with the goal of
submitting a draft proposal for endorsement to the June 2007 CG/APM meeting.
G-JAS partners plan to initiate in early 2007 a comprehensive exercise that will
establish how to be more selective in our financial programming, policy dialogue and
technical cooperation and how to concentrate our efforts in line with our comparative
advantages. To reach its full potential this division of labour exercise will involve the
government at the earliest opportunity. The target date for initial discussion of
recommendations on this theme would be at the June 2007 CG/APM meeting.

Annex 1: Summary of Ghana GPRS II Pillars

1.

Private Sector Competitiveness

Objective: To address in a systematic manner the constraints to private sector competitiveness in
agriculture (in the medium term) through the following priority interventions:

..
.

Improve Ghana’s access to global and regional markets
Enhance the efficiency of local markets by ensuring a strong private sector perspective on
macroeconomic policies, financial sector reform, and public sector reform (including probusiness “customer charters” and regulatory impact assessments)

The plan includes strategies for: (a) modernised agriculture, (b) trade and industry, (c) support
sectors (transport, energy and science and technology), (d) the development of sectors with
potential, i.e. information and communication technologies, mining, tourism and the music and
film industry) and (e) establish an employment creation, monitoring and evaluation system
2.

Human Resource Development

Objective: To ensure the development of a knowledgeable, well trained and disciplined labour
force with capacity to drive and sustain private sector-led growth.

The plan includes policies on:
(a) formal education (obligatory school attendance for 11 years rather than 6 years), training and
skills development (including entreprenECrial) and sports):
(b) improved access to health care, malaria control and prevention of HIVIAIDS;
(c) population management;
(d) investments in safe water and environmental sanitation:
(e) urban development, housing and slum upgrading/ urban regeneration, and
(9 protection of the rights of vulnerable members of society.
3.

Governance and Civic Responsibility

Objectives: To empower State and non-State entities to participate in the development process
and to collaborate in promoting peace and stability. To foster effective, responsible and
accountable state machinery with capacity to engage the private sector and civil society. To
consolidate and expand democratic practices and to implement the recommendations of the
African Peer Review Mechanism.

The plan includes strategies to:
(a) Political Governance: (a) review power relationships of the executive and the legislative
branches, (b) enhance decentralisation, (c) protect rights and enhance the administration of
justice, (d) enhance public safety and security, (e) implement civil service reform (with focus on

PART 11: WORLD BANK PROGRAM WITH GHANA
FYOS-11

World Bank Program with Ghana

A.

STRATEGIC FOCUS

The World Bank will support Ghana in implementing its Growth and Poverty Reduction
1.
Strategy (GPRS 11) to achieve middle-income status and the MillenniumDevelopment Goals, and to
ensure that the benefits of growth are shared. The W o r l d Bank’s strategy i s anchored in the
Consultative Group’s framework on Results, Resources and Partnership. The proposed strategy follows
through o n commitments made under the Ghana Joint Assistance Strategy (G-JAS). The overarching
objectives o f the strategy are to support Ghana to: (i)
sustain economic growth o f at least 6% per year;
(ii)
surpass the 2015 Millennium Development Goal o f halving poverty to 26% already during this
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) period; and (iii)
start to reduce inequalities.

2.
The World Bank will support Ghana’s overall development efforts both through general
budget support in the form of a series of poverty reduction support credits (PRSCs) and further
analytical and financial support to the three pillars of GPRS 11, by: (i)
raising private sector
competitiveness through engagements in private and financial sector development, the modernization o f
agriculture, sustainable natural resource management, infrastructure and innovatively, employment
policies; (ii)
improving human development outcomes, with interventions in the health, education, water
and sanitation, and social protection sectors; and (iii)
strengthening governance through activities in
decentralization, including urban policy, public sector reform, economic governance and promoting
evidence and results-based public policy choice.
This strategy i s built taking into account: (i)
government’s indications o f i t s demand for World
3.
Bank assistance in certain sectors; (ii)
lessons from a series o f broad development dialogues and from the
client survey (see B o x 1); (iii)
discussions with development partners to follow up on G-JAS
commitments to joint programming; (iv) lessons from the review o f the last Country Assistance Strategy
(see Annex 3); and (v) evidence from analytical work, such as the on-going work o n accelerating shared
growth (see B o x 2).

4.

The World Bank Program specifically addresses lessons learned from the implementation
of the last program, set out in Annex 3, These lessons include: (i)
government and stakeholder
ownership are critical to success o f policy reform, project implementation and relevance o f analytical
work; (ii)
the results framework needs to be better defined and better map results to measurable outcomes
that government and partner contributions actually can impact; (iii)
the Multi-Donor Budget Support was
critical to overall achievement o f objectives, but the framework s t i l l poses challenges in transaction costs
and sector alignment; (iv) sector operations need to incorporate cross-cutting and multi-sectoral
approaches; (v) regional projects need to be closely aligned; (vi) integrating World Bank Group
engagement requires further effort; and (vii) decentralization o f Bank analytical, operational and
executive capacity i s critical to respond to client needs.

Box 1: Development Dialogue and Client Survey: A M o r e Open World Bank
The W o r l d Bank Ghana Office has facilitated the Development Dialogue Series (DDS) since 2003. By partnering
with prominent Ghanaian institutions and think tanks, their a i m i s to promote vibrant policy debate to support
informed public policy choice. These have focused largely o n the central themes related to the GPRS 11, in total 2 1
events with close t o 5000 participants. By partnering with radio stations to take the dialogues public through live
broadcasts, the D D S has reached large audiences in Accra, Kumasi, Cape Coast, Tamale, H o and surrounding
districts.
The dialogues have also become a useful platform for leveraging follow-up action o n new ideas. There i s currently
a national Interfaith Waste Management Initiative, and an encouraging engagement to tap the growth potential o f
Ghana’s music industry. These and other budding c i v i l society initiatives have resulted directly f r o m the DDS. The
D D S has become a way o f reaching out to broad segments o f society, and as i s noted in the feedback f r o m the
Bank’s 2006 Client Survey, which rate the W o r l d Bank highly for i t s openness and commitment t o civic dialogue.
A Development Marketplace, “Innovation, Entrepreneurship, Jobs,” in 2005 attracted applications f r o m over 1000
s m a l l enterprises f r o m across the country and was carried out in collaboration with the Ghanaian private sector, IFC
and Dutch S N V . Beside awarding 20 successful businesses, the event helped break ground for the role o f small
enterprise in development, for which the W o r l d Bank Group was recognized by a leading business paper.

A Client Survey was undertaken June-September 2006, when a broad array o f stakeholders were invited to provide
their opinions o n the Bank’s assistance. There i s a high level o f support for Bank involvement in Ghana, with 57%
o f respondents saying the B a n k should be more involved while 27% say the Bank i s optimally involved.
Growth i s considered to be the top development priority for Ghana, followed by education and governance.
Stakeholders envision an important role for the Bank in these areas - particularly in education, economic growth and
agriculture. Donor coordination i s seen as crucial for overall effectiveness. Regional integration in West Africa,
particularly for trade and investment i s considered important for Ghana’s growth.
The Bank i s seen to be a provider o f both finances and knowledge. In 2003,57% o f stakeholders said financial
resources were the greatest value brought to Ghana by the Bank. In 2006, only 25% identified financial resources as
the top value, while ‘knowledge’ increased significantly in terms o f i t s importance t o stakeholders (see graph).
Survey findings related to media show that respondents receive most o f their information about development related
issues f r o m local media (57%), as well as the W o r l d Bank Ghana office (39%), and the internet. Bank-internal
media tracking covering several thousand articles over the past years indicate strongly a dominance o f neutral or
positive coverage. Between M a y 2005 and M a y 2006, an internal analysis o f media monitoring indicated that
articles in the local press o n the W o r l d Bank Group were 78% positive, 21% neutral and 1% negative. In July 2003April 2005, 10% o f local press was negative.

The governance foundations for Ghana’s development are strong, but for Ghana to break
out of its low-income status and meet its middle-income aspirations, it needs to step up its
governance performance. As Ghana turned fifty on March 6 2007, it looked back at a quarter century o f
recovery and improvement after three coups that interrupted i t s constitutional governments. Today, it
needs to evolve the political economy around pro-growth policies and to strengthen the capacity for
value-for-money choices in the public sector, strengthening also district and municipal government.
With a democratic constitution adopted in 1990, a current competitive political scene which has seen
shifts in elected leadership, and, a vibrant open, public debate, Ghana’s democratic culture looks set to
deepen. I t s state institutions are respected, i t s traditional authorities are an important part o f the social
fabric, human rights and social capital are highly valued national assets, and i t s media and civil society
are vocal and independent. These strengths have helped Ghana to make continuous progress over the
years, and are essential governance foundations for the future. However, key constraints to growth
remain, perceptions o f corruption indicate little progress in recent years, and government needs to
strengthen the processes for informed evidence- and results-based public choice. T h e CAS seeks to
strengthen overall development dialogue, based on evidence- and results-based public policy choice and
an annual CG framework; the role o f the budget, i t s fiduciary underpinnings, and i t s importance to
democratic decision-making; and sectoral policy, regulatory and institutional frameworks to facilitate a
jobs-creating private sector, an empowered civil society and a capable, accountable state.
6.

Ghana’s macroeconomic performance has also been strong, notwithstanding recent fiscal
challenges. Indeed, the Ghanaian economy has remained remarkably resilient in the face o f increases in
petroleum prices in international markets, and disruption in domestic power supply, sustaining real GDP
growth and macroeconomic stability. Real GDP growth increased from an average o f about 4% over the
last 20 years to around 6 percent over the last three years (2004-2006). The consumer price index has
declined markedly, falling from 23 percent at end-2003 to just over 10 percent at end-2006. Recent
information indicates however the first deviation from the path o f fiscal consolidation that began in 2002,
with the overall fiscal deficit estimated to have risen to 7.7 percent o f GDP, up from 3.0 percent at end2005. While some o f the deterioration in fiscal accounts reflected lower than projected tax revenue
collections, public sector pay increases and the re-emergence o f energy subsidies accounted for most o f
the widening in the deficit in the second h a l f o f 2006. A s a result, the domestic debt to GDP ratio, which
has been the cornerstone o f fiscal policy in recent years, i s estimated to have risen to 13.8 percent by end2006, up from 10.8 percent at end-2005, but s t i l l under the 2002 ratio o f 29%. Well aware o f the risks
that macro-imbalances would pose to growth and poverty reduction, government i s committed to take
corrective action. The overall trend in public debt remains firmly downwards with the central
government debt to GDP ratio falling to 42 percent in 2006 from 70 percent in 2005, reflecting the impact
o f the completion point o f the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) debt initiative and access to the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). The Multi-Donor Budget Support (MDBS) framework i s the
cornerstone o f partners’ contribution to macro-economic stability. T h i s C A S reinforces the World Bank’s
support to the budget and i t s fiduciary underpinnings.

Box 2: Emerging Findings of Analytical Work on Shared Growth
In September, the World Bank launched work on a Country Economic Memorandum, with strong participation by the

Ministry o f Finance and Economic Planning, the National Development Planning Commission, Ghanaian research
institutions and other partners. Results of a first phase will be presented at the Consultative Group meeting June 18-19
2007, with the Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) being finalized in 2008.
Ghana has accelerated economic growth and is en route to achieve the key poverty millennium development
goal (MDG) well ahead o f schedule, although there i s some evidence that inequality i s growing. Overall,
Ghana’s robust growth over the past 15 years was remarkably poverty reducing. Even taking into account the
significant population growth, the number o f poor people was reduced by 1.7 million, from 7.9 million in 1991 to
6.2 million in 2006. I t may be harder to reduce poverty at the same rapid pace in future years given that those who
remain very poor today tend to be concentrated in regions with fewer opportunities for growth and there i s some
evidence that inequality has grown. At the same time, however, there are now better opportunities for targeted
policy interventions and programs precisely because poverty i s more concentratedin the northern part o f the
country.
Ghana’s accelerated growth i s not just a result o f high gold and cocoa prices but also due to improving
economic policy environment and investment climate, rising amounts o f investments, and increasingly
harmonized aid. Ghana i s now, with Tanzania and Uganda, one of the strongest policy performers among lowincome African countries, with Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) at 3.9, at a par with, for
example, Vietnam. Ghana now invests about 30% o f Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and attracts strong donor
support, with donors reporting increasing actual disbursements from about $700 million in 2002 to above $1200
million in 2006. While past growth was mainly driven by factor accumulation, more recently there i s indication o f
gradual productivity increases, including from small cocoa farms.
Nevertheless, Ghana continues to face important growth constraints and risks. Ghana needs to further
increase agricultural productivity while preserving its land resources asset, with greater use o f technology,
Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and the participation by the private sector. Important
infrastructure gaps need to be addressed, particularly in energy, water and transport. Although Ghana has improved
its ranking in the Doing Business index, i t started from a low base and further improvements are needed. Ghana
needs to reinforce its fiscally prudent approach, including finding a long-term solution to the size o f the wage bill
and consistent implementation of government’s full cost with broad based jobs creation being the strongest
recovery policy in public utilities related to important infrastructure gaps.
The determinants o f persistent poverty and inequality are many. The significantly higher poverty rates in rural
Ghana have several causes. The ago-climatic conditions in Northern Ghana lead to stagnant yields in food staples.
The overall constraints to private sector activity and access to services are more severe in rural areas, further
encouraging agglomeration to major urban centers. Urbanization i s accelerating and i s projected to reach 58% by
2030. Though urban living standards have grown on average, urban poverty i s also a cause o f concern, with
poverty in Accra, for example, having increasedto 10.6% in 2005. Inequality appears to have worsened from 0.32
in 2000 to 0.35 in 2005, as measured by the consumption gini. These disparities are o f concern since shared
growth generates higher growth. Broad-basedjobs creation, in a growing economy, i s the strongest factor behind
reducing poverty and diminishing inequality. Further analytical work and policy dialogue will need to determine
the role o f employment policy in Ghana’s development strategy.
Ghana’s progress on indicators o f gender equality has not kept pace. Both the GPRS I1 and the Africa Peer
Review Mechanism stress the importance o f gender equality and women’s advancement for Ghana’s aspirations.
Government has laid the foundations through policies, legislation, and an institutional framework on women’s
rights. Implementation o f such policies remains weak. Because o f the lack on data to demonstrate gender equality
as an economic growth issue, the topic often does not receive the attention in policy dialogue at the high levels that
it requires. Gender division in agricultural labor and access to resources and technology, for example, likely has
implications for productivity, innovation, and household food security.
Ghana appears to be a prime candidate for scaling up financial support, provided government also adopts a
stronger value-for-money approach. There are clear bottlenecks in the provision o f public goods such as
infrastructure. A value-for-money approach to public sector expenditure and public-private partnerships i s now a
high priority. The authorities are intent to improve management in key areas such energy, agriculture, water and
sanitation. An intensified partnership to scale-up both results and resources should be sought.

4

7.

The proposed CAS strategy marks a further shift to strong sector arrangements and better
alignment with government’s budget and overall results-orientation, in close harmonization with
other development partners according to commitments in the GJAS. The strategy foresees, in
particular, a greater reliance on development policy operations (DPOs). The M D B S framework, within
which the Bank contributes through a series o f PRSCs, together with the fiscal space from debt relief,
provides the support for the overall budget process, with actions and outcomes monitored through a
rolling three-year common Progress Assessment Framework. Further DPOs are foreseen in multi-donor
arrangements in agriculture, decentralization, natural resource and environmental management, social
protection and possibly public and private sector reform and post-basic education. Investment lending i s
foreseen in particular for infrastructure, including several regional projects. Inhealth, the Bank will n o
longer contribute through a Sector-Wide Approach (SWAP), responding to the closer budgetary
alignment o f the Ministry o f Health, and seeing the Bank’s financial support as coming mainly through
general budget support and debt relief, although the Bank will continue to provide directed technical
support to health insurance and make a special effort to boost child and mother survival. Similarly in
education, the Bank will not provide a DPO to basic education, but increasingly shift focus to post-basic
education, and possibly to science and technology. This overall shift in the Bank’s strategy i s responsive
to both government’s request and G-JAS commitments to joint programming, good practice
harmonization and sector alignment.

B.

RESULTS

8.

The World Bank Program results framework i s derived from Ghana’s developmental
aspirations as articulated in the GPRS I
Iand the continuous evolution of government’s sector
strategies, particularly as evidenced in the government’s budget and mid-term economic
frameworks. In accordance with the Ghana Joint Assistance Strategy (G-JAS), the World Bank and
other G-JAS signatories use the Ghana Partnership Results Matrix (GPRM) as the overall framework for
tracking aid effectiveness. This i s presently being up-dated in preparation for the June 2007 Consultative
Group Meeting. As agreed with government and DPs, the World Bank C A S results framework selects a
number o f areas from the GPRM and presents outcomes that the W o r l d Bank will influence, as well as
milestones and instruments. Based on the findings o f the C A S Completion Report, the team has been
careful to select indicators that relate to Bank interventions, can be monitored during the CAS timeframe
and for which there are data sources.
The World Bank Program has three overarching objectives - increasing economic growth,
reducing poverty and reducing inequalities. While strongly supporting government’s ambitions to
accelerate growth above current levels and not seeing levels o f 8% or above as outside reach, the CAS
sets as an objective to sustain annual economic growth above 6%. In so doing, the CAS seeks to ensure
that such growth delivers significant reduction in poverty - as has happened in the recent period,
according to recent GLSS statistics. This CAS seeks to support Ghana in surpassing the poverty MDG
which, for Ghana, i s 26%, down from the recorded 51.5% in 1991. These statistics also show, however,
that growth - and hence opportunities to elevate from poverty - has not been uniform across Ghana, with
progress in some areas markedly better than others. T h i s CAS, therefore, also focuses on starting to
reduce inequalities. The CAS cannot set a single overarching target but instead will track a number o f
disparities in access to education, health, education and agricultural services by region and gender.’

9.

I

T o better track progress o n inequality in agriculture, the proportion o f public agricultural spending allocated to the
three Northern regions will be monitored. At present, this area receives 24% o f public agricultural spending. In
education the indicator used t o track regional disparities will be the percentage o f untrained teachers in deprived
districts. The baseline i s 57% (as opposed t o the national average o f 38%). F o r gender the disparity tracked i s the
difference between junior secondary school completion for boys and girls. The baseline i s 10%. For health we will

5

Developing the statistical and analytic basis i s a major priority under this Strategy for better
understanding these inequalities, as laid out in the analytical and advisory assistance (AAA). In a
growing economy, broad-based employment generation will become an increasingly important means by
which poverty and inequality objectives can be achieved, Again, statistical and analytical frameworks are
only n o w being developed to place employment generation at the core o f strategic objectives. The
planned Poverty Assessment and the Employment Policy study to be delivered under the C E M will
provide insight on a more strategic approach to employment under the next CAS period. Government has
indicated interest in working with private sector, trade unions, research institutions and other stakeholders
to develop an employment policy. The employment policy will facilitate private sector based formal j o b
creation, formalization o f the informal sector and progress on other labor market issues’.

10.
The Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs), as well as key analyticalwork (such as
the Country Economic Memorandum, the Poverty Assessment and the ExternalReview of Public
FinancialManagement), support actions in all three pillars. The PRSC will continue to be the main
source o f budget support, providing $100 million annually within the Multi-Donor Budget Support
framework (MDBS), which i s a lower level than PRSC 1-5 (on average $125 million per year), taking
into account the fiscal space provided by the HIPC Completion Point and Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative (MDRI) o f about $125 million annually from the World Bank. PRSC 6-9 will draw on a
growing body o f M D B S evaluation, but the fundamental role o f the M D B S P R S C in promoting Ghana’s
recent progress i s widely agreed.
I.

GPRS I1 Pillar One: Private Sector Competitiveness

Outcomes that the Bank expects to influence over the CASperiod:

.

Private sector credit increases from 21.6% to 27% o f GDP.
Competitiveness in Ghana improves as evidenced by a move from #7 1 to #60 in the
Business Competitiveness Ranlung.
Productivity per hectare o f agricultural commodities increases by 10% from current levels.
Value o f exports o f non-traditional agricultural commodities increases by 10% from the
current level o f $65.13m.
Number o f female farmers registered in Farmer-Based Organizations increases from 6,853
to 9000.
Resource depletion and environmental degradation i s reduced by an average o f 0.5% per
year from a level o f 10% o f GDP in 2006.
Time for registering agricultural land i s reduced from 3 years to 3 months.
Number o f women applicants using land deeds to obtain access to credit i s doubled.
Household electrification rate increases from 54% in 2005 to 56%.
Distribution losses in Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) system are reduced from 26%
in 2006 to 25%.
Road conditions improve to meet targets: trunk roads: 55% good, 35% fair, 10% poor;
urban roads: 65% good, 20.6% fair, 14.4% poor; feeder roads: 60% good, 28% fair, 12%
poor.

the percentage o f supervised deliveries by qualified health workers by region w i l l be tracked. The baseline i s Upper
East 39.5%, Upper West 26.7% and Northern Region 26.3%.
To better track progress on employment, the Bank w i l l monitor current measures, in particular the evolution o f the
share o f formal wage employment, and further support the statistical and analytical base. The baseline for formal
jobs out o f total employment i s 12.2% according to the GLSS. The share o f private formal employment has grown
from 3.6% (1991/92), 4% (1998/99), 5.9% (2005/6). The share o f public formal employment has declined from
9.7% (1991/92), to 7.6% (1998/99), to 6.3% (2005/06).

’

6

Formal private sector employment increases from 5 -9%.
Number o f jobs created in the ICT/ITES industry increases from 2200 jobs (2006) to 4,000
jobs, including at least 2,000 for women.
Ratio o f electronic to manual transactions between government and recipients increases
from 5% to 20%.

The World Bank, in collaboration with other partners, i s supporting government efforts to achieve
11,
the above outcomes through engagement in the following areas:

i.
Private Sector Competitiveness. The World Bank will continue i t s support both to financial
sector reform and private sector development. The Bank will support the establishment o f a financial
market which i s competitive. Further analytical work will be done in this area, either as the Financial
Sector Strategy Papers produced with the IMF or as a national chapter o f the regional work, Making
Finance Work for Ghana. A FINSCOPE study on access to finance issues i s being carried out with the
Ministry o f Finance and Economic Planning and Department for International Development (DFID), and
additional technical support may be required as Ghana pursues non-concessional financing. T w o ongoing projects - the Economic Management Capacity Building (EMCB) and the Micro, Small and
Medium Enterprise Project (MSME) projects - will support small and medium enterprises, financial
access, pensions and rural finance. In the area o f business environment, the earlier Trade and Gateway
project will close, the M S M E will provide support to the pooled funding arrangement with other partners,
and, subject to available resources, a new DPO may be introduced to continue to address business
environment policy reforms, possibly including employment policy. Within the context o f the MSME,
the I F C will provide advisory support to improve the banks and investee companies competitiveness, in
additional to a line o f credit and a partial credit guarantee. The eGhana project will also facilitate better
access to communication, and business costs, thereby promoting an emerging IT-based business sector.
IFC (the International Finance Cooperation) has also developed a strategy to develop i t s activities
in the Ghanaian financial sector. The pipeline includes: the IDA-IFC M S M E line o f credit and partial
credit guarantee; trade finance; housing finance; and potential investments in individual financial

institutions. In December 2006, IFC approved trade lines o f $15 million to two local banks, Merchant
Bank Ghana and Trust Bank. I F C has also partnered with KfW, under the proposed Microfinance
Initiative for Sub-Saharan Africa, to support the establishment o f two microfinance institutions in the
country. In addition, I F C has been supporting government and the banking sector in the establishment o f
a credit reporting system in the country, specifically by strengthening the legal framework. I F C
committed financing for Newmont Ghana Gold Limited’s Ahafo gold mine in the Brong Ahafo Region in
July 2006. IFC has provided a $75 million loan and syndicated an additional $50 million from commercial
banks. T o maximize the project’s local development impact, IFC i s working with the company to establish an
H I v / A I D S program as well as an S M E Linkages Program that will focus on supplier development, income
generating opportunities and access to finance with special emphasis on women. IFC expects to begin working
with Newmont on mitigating environmental and social issues surrounding the Akyem gold mine.

ii.
Modernization of Agriculture. Agriculture has been the main driver o f recent growth in Ghana
and has the potential to become an engine o f future growth. I t has also played an important role in
ensuring that the benefits o f growth are shared. In order to further increase the sustainable production o f
agricultural commodities and exports o f non-traditional agricultural commodities, particularly by
integrating small holders into value chains and by reducing the incidence o f poverty among food crop
producers, the World Bank will continue to provide support through a new series o f development policy
operations. T h e closed Agricultural Services Sub-Sector Investment Project (AgSSIP) will be followed
by a series o f DPOs known as the Agricultural Development Policy Operation (AgDPOs), beginning in
FY08 and responding to the adoption by government and partners o f the Food and Agriculture Sector

7

Policy (FASDEP) and in support o f a sector-wide approach in agriculture. This will support decentralized
planning and implementation o f services in the supporting sectors and a monitoring and evaluation
framework. This series will be accompanied by Global Environment Facility (GEF) to support the scaleup o f sustainable land management practices. The DPO instrument will help address cross-cutting policy
issues. It will be informed by the rural investment climate survey that i s planned for FY09, as well as the
public expenditure and institutional review for the rural development sector. The Bank also recently
approved a regional project promoting regional cooperation in the area o f generation and dissemination o f
improved agricultural technologies in priority commodities (West Africa Agriculture Productivity
Program), joining Ghana (roots and tubers), M a l i (rice), and Senegal (cereals). The primary beneficiaries
o f this project will include poor consumers, producers and ago-processing businesses. A West Africa
Fisheries Project i s also under discussion.

iii.

Sustainable Natural Resource Management. The W o r l d Bank-led multi-donor Country
Environmental Assessment showed that the annual cost o f degradation to the country’s accumulated
wealth i s equivalent to 10% o f GDP (of which 4% i s in forestry and wildlife and 4% in environmental
health, 1.6 in agricultural soils and 0.4 in fisheries and Lake Volta) and i s reducing the potential for
growth by about one percentage point. Cost estimates o f environmental degradation and the impact o n
growth have been led by the Ministry o f Finance, which argues that initiatives must be taken for the
country to manage the situation. In addition to the two on-going GEF projects in the sector, a new series
o f DPOs will address governance issues with the overall objective o f ensuring sustainable economic
growth, increasing revenues and improving environmental protection, particularly in forestry and mining.
This i s a harmonized sector operation with AFD, DFID, EC, Netherlands and Switzerland. The amount
o f this Natural Resources and Environmental Governance (NREG) D P O will depend on the IDA
envelope. In land administration, the World Bank will continue to support the establishment o f a well
functioning land administration system. The on-going Land Administration Project (LAP) improves
customary and cadastre-based land administration, as well as women’s access to financial services in the
informal sector. Reforms in this sector need a sustained commitment and several other donors are scaling
back their presence. I t i s thus possible that a second land administration and management project will be
prepared in FY 10 to fund the next stage o f reforms, including financing surveys and maps, re-inventoring
and re-evaluating state property, establishing land management information systems and supporting a
more systematic registration o f lands and deeds. In addition, a follow-up to the existing national GEF
Northern Savanna Project for the implementation o f the trans-frontier wild-life corridor with Burkina
Faso and Togo i s being considered.
Infrastructure. Creating a much stronger infrastructural platform i s essential to achieve
iv.
Ghana’s comprehensive development strategy. The Bank will continue i t s strong engagement in energy,
transport, water (see Pillar 11) and I C T to support private sector competitiveness.
In energy, the Bank responded to Ghana’s new energy policy in 2003, with significant analytical
work, support through the PRSC, and several regional projects: the West African Gas Pipeline (an IDA
Partial Risk Guarantee and MIGA coverage) and two West African Power Pool (WAPP) projects.
However, energy continues to be a key constraint to private sector growth at all levels and puts at risk
progress o n fiscal balance (see B o x 3). A major new energy project, the Ghana Energy Development and
Access Project (GEDAP) to be delivered early in FY08, will support urgent sector investment for
transmission and distribution and, particularly, increase rural access to power both from the national grid
and renewable energy sources). A third West Africa Power Pool project i s under preparation. It i s also
possible that a guarantee operation in generation might be pursued.

Box 3: Energy: Key to Macro Stability and Business Balance Sheets
The recent energy crisis that Ghana i s experiencing can be attributed t o five factors: (i)
the increase in the share o f
thermal power generation in the overall power generation mix, exacerbated by reduced availability o f hydro power;
(ii)
below cost recovery tariffs, particularly at a time when the c o k t r y i s increasing i t s reliance o n more expensive
thermal power generation; (iii)
delays in government compensation to power companies for the suspended tariff
increases; (iv) subsidised long-term power supply contracts t o selected industrial consumers; and (v) substantial
energy losses and pilferage.
The W o r l d Bank has supported government in the energy sector through a number o f interventions and i s presently
preparing both a PRSC 5 operation, a sector project (GEDAP) and a further regional project (WAPP 3) to support
reforms in the sector. The objectives o f these reforms are to: (i)
address financial shortfalls in the energy sector;
(ii)
improve energy sector governance; and (iiistrengthen
)
and expand the power, transmission and distribution
systems. Actions identified under the f i r s t objective were also included in the agenda o f the IMF’s article I V
consultations. In reaching these objectives government aims at laying the groundwork for: (i)
the financial viability
o f the sector; (ii)
broadening access to electricity, (iii)
enabling Ghana to access and share West Africa’s hydro and
natural gas resources; and (iv) allowing private sector participation in the energy sector.
During the preparation o f the CAS, government has indicated its commitment to take critical measures such as:
(i)
achieving cost recovery tariffs for the power sector; (ii)
restoring Volta River Authority’s (VRAs) financial
strength beginning in 2007; (iii)
commercializing bulk power supply transactions; and (iv) effective management of
the Electricity Company o f Ghana (ECG).

MIGA (the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency) i s working with I F C and IDA to identify
private sector energy projects that need support. In December 2004 MIGA signed i t s first contract in the
Ghanaian energy sector in support o f the West African Gas Pipeline (WAGP). At the time it was
understood that downstream energy investments - including investments at Takoradi to convert existing
thermal power plants from o i l to gas - would need support once the pipeline was commissioned. I t i s
n o w expected that the pipeline will be commissioned during the second half o f 2007. MIGA i s also
seeking to support independent power producer (IPP) projects in the country, including at Tema and
Takoradi. In the WAGP project, the main r i s k that MIGA underwrote was payment r i s k o n VRA which
has not subsided. I t i s expected that MIGA will, in future, underwrite similar risks. T o support projects
in the energy sector, MIGA will rely on IDA’Spolicy dialogue with government. Specifically, MIGA
will be loolung for the formulation o f a transparent and competitive framework for independent power
producers, which could increase power generation drawing on the gas that will flow once the pipeline i s
completed this year.
In transport, significant new investments are foreseen. T o support the essential regional
integration, where Ghana has a strong potential, a number o f regional projects including the West Africa
Trade and Transit, the West Africa Lagos-Abidjan, the West Africa Air Safety projects are under
implementation or planned (see Box 4). T o follow up o n the major sector-wide 2002 roads project, a new
Transport SWAP i s foreseen for FY 2009, responding to government’s new multi-modal transport sector
strategy. T o begin to address urban challenges and improve personal mobility in Ghana’s cities, an Urban
Transport project has been prepared. The Bank foresees transport as a major component o f our program
to contribute to ease one o f the binding constraints to accelerated economic growth.
In ICT, the W o r l d Bank policy dialogue, technical assistance and analytical work has begun to
pay off. Since 2004, the World Bank has provided support for the development o f the National Telecom
Policy, facilitated the drafting and issuance o f formal licenses to mobile operators who had operated for
several years with informal authorizations and, in collaboration with the U S Agency for International
Development (USAID), provided support for the drafting o f key sector legislation. Teledensity during
this period rose from about 5% in 2004 to over 20% in 2006. The contribution o f the ICT sector to GDP

9

has been increasing steadily from 1.8% in 2000 to 6% in 2005. The World Bank will continue to support
Government’s vision o f ICT-led growth. The eGhana Project i s harnessing Ghana’s potential to develop
an IT-enabled services industry generating further growth and employment. Ghana has been ranked as

Box 4: Regional Integration: A National Priority
Ghana has made integration in West Africa a matter o f national priority. I t i s arguing that national efforts will not
suffice to achieve its development objectives and therefore has given regional integration a pre-eminent place in i t s
development agenda. On-going and planned Bank-supported regional initiatives in which Ghana participates relate
to the accelerated and shared growth agenda, and are aimed at improving the country’s competitiveness. These
initiatives support energy, transport, agriculture and fisheries, services and also a trans-frontier wild-life corridor
with Burkina Faso and Togo and possibly beyond.
In ICT, Ghana will benefit f r o m the Economic Community o f West African States (ECOWAS) program for a
competitive regional telecommunication market. The Bank will continue t o support the promotion o f affordable and

open access connectivity. The Bank recognizes that when the regional investments and the appropriate policy and
regulatory environment exist, it will contribute t o removing barriers to doing business and increasing
competitiveness. The Bank is fiuther committed to mobilizing other development partners’ assistance to support the
West Africa Regional Communications Infrastructure Program.
In regional trade, i t i s also possible that Ghana may access the Trust Fund for Trade that it has been recently created.
In addition, under the Aid for Trade initiative, a joint program will be developed with E C O W A S to support the
analytics and the operationalization o f removing the behind the border barriers and addressing the supply constraints
o f these countries to be inserted in the global economy.

the number one rising global sourcing destination and i s consistently ranked by major international
research f i r m s as one o f two African countries (in addition to South Africa) most likely to attract
outsourced IT related services - usually referred to as Business Process Offshoring (BPO). The BPO
sector in Ghana has the potential t o generate up to 40,000 jobs (50% expected to be women) and $750
million in revenues within five years. I t i s estimated that each j o b in the BPO sector can create 3 to 4 jobs
in cluster sectors including transportation, construction, health, entertainment and other services. I F C has
also been active in the telecommunication sector, committing a $40 million loan to Scancom to upgrade
and expand the company’s G S M network.

Box 5: ICT: Improving Efficiency and Transparency in Public Services
Government derives approximately 25% o f i t s total revenues f r o m customs and has therefore, been under
tremendous pressure to enhance trade facilitation efficiency and generate more revenues. The m a i n reasons for l o w
revenues have been slow trade flows as the carrier has t o submit 13 copies o f the shipping manifest to the customs.
This has often resulted in increased paperwork, administrative errors, and sometimes corruption.
The W o r l d Bank’s assistance, through the Ghana Gateway Project, resulted in the creation o f a joint venture with the
private sector to modernize the functions o f the Customs Department. The GCNET operation has been largely
successhl, with the time required to clear customs reduced f r o m over 2.5 days to less than 6 hours and the total
admmistrative steps reduced t o 3 compared to the earlier 13. Revenues f r o m customs increased by 49% within the
f i r s t year, and went up by another 45% in the second year o f operations. N e w systems allow customs officers to
more easily determine the shipments that require auditing, define the risk profile o f traders, retain the records of
their activities, and identify patterns t o fight customs fraud.

v.
Employment i s an emerging national priority and, as discussed earlier, has the potential to be a
supporting factor in further reducing poverty and addressing inequalities. The economy’s capacity to
create more and better jobs has arguably increased with economic growth. Although it should perhaps
have been brought into the higher order objectives o f this CAS, current analytics do not easily allow for a
results-focused commitment in this area. As part o f the CEM, analytical work i s supporting government

10

in preparing an employment strategy. Dialogue with the private sectors, trade unions, professional
institutions and c i v i l society organizations will be essential. Investments and policy changes that
contribute to economic growth will need to be combined with labor market reform and action to prepare
the labor force (including the youth) through education and training for more productive and decent jobs.
Particular attention will be paid to understanding gender disparities in labor market outcomes and h o w
both women and men can better prepare to gain from economic growth via participation in the labor
market. The ongoing analytical work i s expected to provide policy suggestions that will help design the
proposed operation

GPRS I1 Pillar Two: Human Development and Basic Services

Outcomes that the Bank expects to influence over the CASperiod:

Primary completion rate increases from 77.6% in 2005 t o 86% in 2010 for both boys and girls.
Primary 6 pass rate (National Education Assessment) in English increases fi-om 23.6% in 2005 to
28.6% in 2009 for both boys and girls.
Number o f post-basic education graduates finding employment in the formal sector increases by
10%.
Percentage o f untrained teachers in deprived districts declines from 57% to 47%.
Difference between boys’ and girls’ junior secondary completion i s halved.
More than 50% o f the indicators for measuring health sector performance meet their targets as
defined in Program o f Work.
Proportion o f children 6-59 months having received a vitamin A supplement in the last six
months i s maintained at 80%.
Percentage o f rural population with sustainable access to safe water sources increases from 53%
to 60%.
Number o f households living in extreme poverty benefiting fi-om Livelihood Employment
Against Poverty (LEAP) Social Grants increases to 2,920.
12.
A key challenge for improving social well-being i s to minimize disparities between rich and
poor, urban and rural populations, women and men, across age groups, and for people with disabilities, in
access to, and use of, social services. Expanding access, for both males and females, to s k i l l s and
competencies, to post-basic education, quality health services (especially for pregnant women),
HJY/AIDS prevention and treatment, as well as to social protection services, i s increasingly important.
Recent work on inequality and poverty shows that there i s a vicious circle that not only relates l o w growth
to high poverty but also high poverty to l o w growth. In Latin America, recent attempts to create a
virtuous circle that supports broad-based attacks o n poverty to feed into higher growth, that in return
further reduces poverty, are beginning to show results. T o address inequities and exclusion and to ensure
that women and men are provided with the opportunity to enjoy the benefits o f growth, the World Bank
will continue to support government in areas defined in Pillar I1o f the GPRS 11. W o r k under this pillar
will be supported by the Maquette for MDG Simulation (MAMS) modeling exercises which are presently
being undertaken with the Ministry o f Finance and Economic Planning (MoFEP) and National
Development Planning Commission (NDPC) to analyze progress in achieving the MDGs and highlight
areas for improvement. The areas for World Bank support include:

i.
Health. The Bank will continue i t s strong engagement in the health sector with financing being
provided through the PRSC, and fiscal space enhanced by debt relief. A health sector country status
report, entitled, Health and Poverty in Ghana, will be delivered in FY09. This AAA i s being done at the
Ministry’s request and jointly with other DPs . I t will provide the analytical basis for government’s 4th 5

11

year program o f work (2012-2016). T w o complementary projects are presented, one to support the
implementation o f the new national health insurance scheme, critical to sector strategy, and the other to
accelerate improvements in child nutrition and malaria prevention. Policy dialogue will be continued
within the framework o f the sector group, the MDBS, on-going advisory services and through
expenditure tracking exercises, which are being undertaken in the health and education sectors, as part o f
the External Review o f Public Financial Management. The two on-going H N / A I D S projects, the recent
Multi-sector H I V / A I D S project and the Regional H I V / A I D S Treatment Acceleration Project, will also
ensure that the gains made in treating and preventing this disease will be consolidated and improved
upon. N o further H I V / A I D S project i s currently envisioned.

ii.
Education. The World Bank has supported the education sector to promote equitable access and
efficient delivery o f pre-tertiary education services, as well as fostering relevant and innovative tertiary
education under the Education Sector Project (EdSeP). The EdSeP i s fully harmonized with
government’s ambitious agenda to reach the MDG key indicators and by a partnership that includes,
among others, DFJD, the EC, U S A I D and the Catalytic Fund provided by the Education for All Fast
Track Initiative. As the country’s needs evolve (see B o x 6), the Bank intends to support government in
implementing i t s new human resource strategy which would include increasing quality o f learning,
expansion o f secondary education, reform o f vocational learning, reform o f tertiary learning, youth
employment and science and technology. This agenda i s critical in supporting Ghana in i t s growth
agenda as i t moves towards new labor and knowledge-intensive sectors and i s supported by the Africa
Action Plan and i t s secondary, tertiary and Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET)
sector strategies. There i s a strong in-country strategy and policy foundation for achieving these goals but
achieving them requires cooperation and partnerships across governmental agencies and with the private
Box 6: Education: A Driver o f Productivity
Ghana i s a frontrunner in achieving the MDG goals, expanding education services at the basic level and setting
high standards for itself. The country i s o n track to provide universal primary education, extend enrollment in
basic education and assure gender parity at t h i s level. However, the increasing enrollment has also brought
increasing challenges in quality, disparities and an expansion o f demand for post-basic education. M o r e
importantly, access to post-basic education has remained unequal. Some 70 percent o f the population does not
have access to any f o r m o f post-basic programs.
Rural to urban migration in Ghana i s increasing as people search for alternative livelihoods. This creates
demand for increasing education attainment both in terms o f completion and in terms o f learning achievements.
Ghanaians expect new skills and pathways towards better earnings. Completion o f junior secondary education,
demand for upper secondary education opportunities, and for accessing tertiary education increased rapidly
over the last decade.
Promoting labor intensive industries i s an important part o f the country’s strategy o f achieving middle income
status. However, industries that require trained labor and technological competencies have not significantly
increased their presence in the country, and in fields, such as construction, communication and services,
medium and high level employees are hired f r o m abroad. At the same time, highly skilled Ghanaians are often
forced to find employment abroad, since they are unable t o find high-skilled jobs at home and they can get
better paying jobs overseas.
The challenge stemming from the improved performance, increasing demand and also increasing economic
expectations helped shape the government White Paper that sets the direction for further improvements in the
education system. The White Paper puts a strong emphasis o n expanding basic education to 11 years and postbasic education to 4 years. In addition, there is a strong focus o n technical and vocational programs and science
and technology capabilities. The direction i s progressive and ambitious and the W o r l d Bank intends to adjust
its instruments to support policy makers in meeting these challenges.

12

sectors. Other development partners, including the A f i x a n Development Bank and UNCTAD have
indicated their interest in providing harmonized support in this area. Thus, depending on the availability
o f IDA resources as well as the additional resources that the World Bank can leverage, it i s likely that
there will be an intervention to address: (i)
the expansion o f post-basic education; (ii)
promoting s k i l l s
development; (iii)
strengthening employment for youth in the formal sectors; and (iv) strengthening the
country’s science and technology capabilities. The policy instruments will include incentives to
strengthen the scale and quality o f TVET provisions on the supply side, to seek training and quality
employment opportunities o n the demand side and to promote innovations, quality employment as well as
the adaptation o f technology in education-industry partnerships.

IFC i s also engaged in the education sector. In FY05 it provided a guarantee to support a $2.2
million facility enabling Trust Bank to offer medium-term lending to private schools under the Ghana
Private School Support Program. Complementing this facility i s an advisory solutions program that aims
to strengthen each school’s financial, managerial and educational capacities and improve the environment
for private education.
iii.
Water has been described as the “silent crisis” in Ghana and has impacts on growth as well as
people’s health. At present, about one in two people live without access to clean water and there i s a risk
that Ghana might not reach this MDG if appropriate decisions and investments are not made. Under the
earlier CAS, IDA i s supporting an Urban Water and a Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation
(STWSS) project, as well as an urban environmental and sanitation project. Community water i s
supported under the Community-Based Rural Development Project (CBRDP). The STWSS project has
achieved important results in working through district assemblies to create local capacity to provide
services in this sector and has already provided access to clean water for 300,000 individuals. In
community water, 280,000 people have been provided with access to water under the CBRDP under the
last CAS. As Ghana moves towards a decentralized service delivery framework, it i s hoped that lessons
from STWSS and CBRDP can be applied when operationalizing the decentralized funding mechanism
currently under preparation (see Pillar 111). Access to water in urban areas remains a challenge and
additional analytical work will be undertaken to better understand the obstacles, prior to the design of the
urban water project which i s foreseen in FY10. Urban sanitation would either be included in this project
or through a separate urban project, depending on how the sector policy develops. Improving urban
sanitation would have positive cross sectoral impacts and would also help better achieve the health and
water MDGs. W o r l d Bank advice and investment will be particularly important in the urban sector to
help stabilize municipal finances, before large scale financing i s sought.
iv.
Social Protection and Exclusion. The World Bank was involved at an early stage in providing
government with inputs and international best practice to develop a Social Protection Strategy which i s
n o w being presented to Cabinet. The strategy i s government’s main policy for tackling extreme poverty
in Ghana and exclusively focuses on the needs and rights o f the extreme poor and the need for better
poverty targeting and mainstreaming o f existing programs and services. The development o f this strategy
has been supported by DFID, UNICEF, the E O and others, through the sector group o n social exclusion
and vulnerability, and foresees a conditional cash transfer program to the extreme poor who have n o
alternative means o f meeting their subsistence needs, the Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty
program (LEAP). A series o f social protection development policy operations i s envisaged, starting in
FY09 to address critical policy actions and reforms in this area. This will be informed by joint technical
assistance which the World Bank and DFID are working on with the Ministry o f Manpower. Government
and partners have expressed a desire for the W o r l d Bank to return to the sector, since the institution i s
well placed to provide best practice from other countries and there are few other DPs involved in this
sector.

The World Bank Institute has three programs under this pillar: (i)

involvement in development debate through a training o f trainers program for youth leaders o n the basics
o f the MDGs and the country poverty reduction strategy; (ii)
helping to augment capacity in service

Outcomes that the Bank expects to influence over the CASperiod:

Deviation in local government plan implementation i s reduced by at least 10%.
Number o f Ministries, Department and Agencies (MDAs) with updated Personnel Records
Management System increases to 30.
Parliamentary Committee on Public Accounts scrutinizes and submits report o n Audited

service delivery. In a comprehensive analysis and action plan, the Africa Peer Review Mechanism
process highlighted several areas which government has incorporated in i t s policy and which form the
basis for development partners' engagement, as indicated in the G-JAS (see B o x 7). One area on which
the World Bank focuses i s the political economy o f reform. The current phase o f public policy has
addressed some o f the vexing macro-economic and structural issues, and poised the country to address a
number o f long-standing challenges. These challenges, include the high wage bill, the mixed
implementation o f cost-recovery policies in public utilities, a business environment s t i l l hampered by red
tape, professionalization o f the civil service, the existence o f large numbers o f subvented agencies that
Box 7: Ghana and the African Peer Review Mechanism
The African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) i s a self-diagnostic instrument voluntarily acceded to by member
states o f the African Union. The primary purpose o f the A P R M i s to foster the adoption o f policies, standards and
practices that lead to political stability, high economic growth, sustainable development and accelerated sub-regional
and continental integration through sharing o f experiences and reinforcement o f successful and best practice.
Ghana was among the first group o f countries to sign the Memorandum o f Understanding o n M a r c h 9,2003 to
participate in the APRM and the first to go through the process. The country self-assessment was undertaken by four
independent research institutions in the four thematic areas o f the A P R M : (i)
democracy and political governance,
(ii)
economic governance and management, (iii)
corporate governance, and (iv) socio-economic development.
Extensive consultations were held with various stakeholders - government officials, political parties,
parliamentarians, the media, trade unions, business, and professional bodies and the general public.
The report made the following recommendations, among others: pursue steps to allow for more effective country
ownership in policy-making; accelerate structural change and diversification in the economy; strengthen the
analytical capability in and outside o f government for national economic policy-making; raise capacity in public
financial management and make fiscal decentralization a reality; complete the review o f the 1999 land policy
recommendations and formulate a plan for implementation; make provision in the electoral l a w for the continuous
registration o f voters; consider the adoption o f an appropriate plan to facilitate the transfer o f administrative and
financial power to decentralized bodies; facilitate the enactment o f the Access To Information Bill; provide
appropriate capacity to parliamentary committees t o enable them t o perform oversight functions effectively and
provide checks and balances with against the Executive; continue with efforts to clear backlog o f cases at the courts;
adopt measures t o enable the public service to deliver more effectively and efficiently; enact the Whistleblower's
Bill; enact comprehensive legislation against corruption; seek the cooperation o f c i v i l society and private sector
organizations t o improve performance in aspects o f corruption control.
Government actions t o responds to the APRM have been incorporated under the governance pillar o f the GPRM.

roles o f and interaction between the public and private sectors, despite a new, strong commitment to
private sector-led development.

This CAS focuses on governance at three levels. First o f all, the overall CG-based approach for
Results, Resources and Partnerships seeks to enhance the framework for public policy choice based on
good analytics and understanding o f trade-offs, and thus, also, to improve the likelihood o f achieving
value-for-money in both domestic resources use and international development assistance, including the
W o r l d Bank‘s contribution. At this general level, the World Bank also seeks to deepen dialogue, both by
supporting an open national policy debate through activities such as the Development Dialogue Series, as
well as increasing i t s own transparency and accessibility. Second, the M D B S financing framework, with
the PRSC on the Bank side, seeks to allow a multi-year commitment to improve governance across the
three GPRS I1pillars: private sector competitiveness, human development and governance. Third, the
sectoral engagements, such as in private and financial sector reform, energy, water and transport
infrastructure, agriculture, natural resource management and ICT, as well as health and education, all seek
to have a lasting impact by supporting core governance mechanisms within sectors. Under Pillar I11o f
this strategy, a specific governance focus i s articulated: decentralization and urban policy, public sector
reform, economic governance and public financial management and a more evidence based approach to
public policy making. Ensuringthe multidisciplinary nature o f each o f these operations with close ties
across ministries will be key to their success. As part o f the AAA review proposed in this CAS, the
country program may also choose to support a review o f the underpinning governance challenges and
strategy, to better understand the lessons and challenges o f reforms in this area, through an institutional
governance review. Further review o f the World Bank Program through the bank’s Governance and AntiCorruption (GAC) strategy, and the Capacity Development and Management Action Plan (CDMAP) i s
also envisioned. Under Pillar I11specific interventions are foreseen in the following areas:

i.

Decentralization. Under the last strategy, three projects have provided lessons on
decentralization. The on-going Community-Based Rural Development Project has been instrumental in
piloting local, community-based approaches to service delivery and in advancing the national debate on
decentralization. The Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation project has also built capacity for
decentralized service delivery. The Promoting Partnerships with Traditional Authorities Project (PPTAP)
suggests that traditional authorities can play a pivotal role in providing services, for example in schools in
underserved areas. Given traditional authorities’ constitutional position in district assemblies, their role in
leveraging communities’ capacities and resources should be drawn on. In addition to these operational
lessons, a consensus in the sector group o n decentralization has recently been created for a harmonized
approach to decentralized service delivery. I t i s thus foreseen that a three-phased development policy
operation will be presented to the Board, beginning in FY09. T h i s operation would become the main
vehicle for addressing essential cross-cutting policy issues. I t would further pursue progress made in
water, sanitation, health and education. Investment in capacity building, much needed to ensure that new
roles and responsibilities are assumed effectively, will complement the institutional reforms supported
under the DPO and will be provided either through additional IDA or other donor resources.

ii.
Urban Policy. Ghana i s following similar trends to the rest o f Africa. By 2030 58% o f the
population will be located in urban areas - currently an annual growth rate o f 3.1%. The effects o f
urbanization are evident in the socio-economic, environmental and institutional challenges for urban
residents and local authorities. Water coverage has declined in urban areas, from 85% in 1990 to 61% in
2004 and solid waste management, despite presenting a huge expense o n the district assemblies’ budgets,
i s not functioning with only 70% o f waste being collected. Although the levels o f urban poverty are s t i l l
low, the data from the GLSS5 suggests that it may be increasing in some cities, in particular Accra.
These cities n o w need infrastructure investment, a transparent regulatory environment and a sound
municipal governance system. A forthcoming E S W looks at Ghana’s urban challenges in three areas:

15

(i)
urbanization and land markets; (ii)
fiscal decentralization and infrastructure; and (iii)
local economic
development. The World Bank will support Ghana as it continues to develop an urban policy. An
investment operation i s considered for FY10.

iii.
Public Sector Reform. Public Sector Reform i s critical to Ghana’s development path. The
history o f support i s brought with mixed results. Government’s renewal o f efforts in 2005 in a Public
Sector Reform Program, after the 2004 elections, i s the basis for World Bank engagement. T h e
Economic Management Capacity Building (EMCB) credit was approved in FY06 and additional
financing to scale up public sector reform i s under consideration. The project addresses reforms both in
the financial sector as well as the public sector. As public sector reform i s a complex long-term process,
i t i s possible that a new momentum will emerge during the CAS period. Areas to be addressed in any
intervention will include rationalizing the civil service pay structure and linking performance to
promotion and pay, restructuring o f Central Management Agencies and improving service delivery to the
private sector, enhancing the value for money in public expenditures, mainstreaming effective inclusion
and voice in the public policy process, e-government, and further work on the use o f development
communications to secure ownership and sustainability o f reform programs. Government i s committed to
ensuring the success o f reforms through the support and participation o f citizens and other beneficiaries in
the reform process. I t i s thus foreseen that a development communication component, embedded in the
GPRS I1and the Public Sector Reform Program, and supported by the EMCB, will be scaled up and
integrated into a broader communication program involving the restructuring o f the Ministry o f
Information and an overhaul o f the communications units o f MDAs. While information i s essential to
strengthen the demand side o f governance, the World Bank has also engaged in a number o f initiatives to
promote transparency and social accountability efforts with non-state actors in Ghana. The team will
continue the use o f instruments to promote more transparent and responsive governance, both at the local
level through, for example, the decentralization DPO, and at the national level in the monitoring of the
results, resources and partnerships involved in the implementation o f the GPRS 11. WBI provides support

Box 8: Ghana’s Public Financial Management System
The key findings o f the June 2006 PEFA assessment against six core P F M objectives are as follows:

Credibility of the Budget: Aggregate expenditure and revenue outturns broadly match the budget plans, but
credibility is diminished by variance across budget heads, reflecting weaknesses in budget formulation and
the treatment o f contingencies.
Comprehensiveness and Transparency of the Budget: This improved considerably over the period 20042005, through the incorporation in the Budget Statement o f information o n internally generated revenues,
direct donor disbursements, H I P C and statutory funds, However, in-year reporting i s less comprehensive,
hampering overall budget scrutiny and management.

Policy-based Budget: While budgets have become more policy-based in recent years, performance i s held
back by limited ability to cost strategies, the lack o f effective wage bill planning, and the absence o f a
transparent link between planned and executed budget activities.
Predictability and Control in Budget Execution: Government has improved commitment and other internal
controls, but recognizes weaknesses in management and oversight o f control systems.
Accounting, Recording and Reporting: Predominantly a paper-based system, resulting in delays and data
errors. Analytical and technical capacity constraints hamper MoFEP and MDA efforts to monitor and
analyze budget performance.
External Scrutiny and Audit: There i s n o w more timely completion o f accounts and financial statements and
submission o f audit reports t o the legislature, which in turn i s more actively scrutinizing b o t h budget and
accounts. However, effective follow-up o n audit findings remains a question, and excessive detail o f budget
documents undermines effective Parliamentary scrutiny.

16

in this area through three programs: (i)
the adjudication capacity o f traditional authorities to prepare the

grounds for integrating such responsibilities into the formal judicial systems, expediting adjudication o f
civil cases, reducing the backlog o f civil cases and reducing the time and cost o f business litigation, (ii)
the role o f media and (iii)
support to Parliament in i t s oversight and monitoring role through support to
the Finance and Public Accounts Committee.
iv.
Economic Governance. World Bank support for economic governance will be provided through
both operational and analytic tools. E M C B provides support for the regulatory fiamework for financial
services. Support for internal audit, external audit and the judicial system through IDF grants will also be
provided. In addition, annual External Review o f Public Financial Management reviews (ERPFMs) have
supported the PRSC policy dialogue in this key area and progress has been recorded in the assessment o f
the HIPC expenditure management benchmarks (see B o x 8).
v.
The ERPFM presently underway focuses on procurement. Emerging findings suggest that Ghana
has made significant progress in establishing supportive legal frameworks but that improvements are s t i l l
needed in implementation (see B o x 9). In 2006, the Public Expenditure Financial Accountability (PEFA)
assessment confirmed that the country’s Public Financial Management (PFM) system i s based upon a
solid legal and regulatory framework, and performs at an average standard and in some areas in an above
average way. These reviews have been well received by government and are n o w being expanded to
cover areas such as procurement and expenditure reviews in the education and health sectors in 2007 and
2008, respectively. Supporting a more strategic use o f public expenditure i s an important factor behind
productivity gains and the growth path that the country has set out for itself. As the ERPFM reviews
continue, government will assume i t s leading role. This analytical work provides an opportunity for
policy dialogue on how to get better value out o f public expenditures and will complement and feed into
the E S W being undertaken on value for money. A full fledged PEFA assessment will be undertaken in
2009, with 2006 as baseline.
vi.
Promoting Evidence and Results-Based Public Policy Choice. Finally, to build o n the
progress made by government with respect to monitoring and evaluating the implementation o f the GPRS
11, to further strengthen capacity for an evidence and results-based approach to policy-making, and to
provide solid information on the use o f expenditures and their impact o n different segments o f the
population, a SWAP i s foreseen, for FY09. This will build on the analytical work being undertaken in
the area o f value-for-money and through the IDF, as well as, for example, the work done by the education
sector to increase district level capacity in planning, managing and assessing local educational service
delivery. A s Ghana moves to improve sector plans, supported by DPOs, ensuring there i s solid statistics
to measure results i s key.

Box 9: Ghana’s Public Procurement System

The 2003 CPAR found: lack o f a comprehensive legal framework; use o f merit point system for evaluating bids for
works contracts; use o f “bracketing” for evaluating bids for works contracts; excessive use o f single source; repetitive
use o f same firms under selective tendering procedures; lack o f procurement planning; poor record keeping; weak
oversight o f procurement; poor contract management; poor stores management; weak procurement capacity, and weak
budget commitment control leading to contract payment arrears.
Progress since the CPAR: Ghana has since made progress in the improvement o f its public procurement legal and
institutional framework including: (i)
enactment o f the Public Procurement Law; (ii)
establishment o f the Public
Procurement Board (PPB)); (iii)
development o f standard bidding documents and Request for Procurements; (iii)
establishment

Challenges:

Legal and regulatory and institutional
framework: Draft regulations exist that
supplement and detail the provisions o f the

Public Procurement Act, but i t has not yet been tabled before Parliament. Mainstreaming o f procurement i s held back
by the limited ability o f procurement entities t o adequately link procurement planning with budget formulation and
execution. The budget guidelines for 2008 make a special point to reinforce the role o f procurement planning, a
welcome development.
Monitoring and Evaluation: Although the combined procurement planning tools have the potential for collecting and
analyzing data, quality control in their implementation needs to be strengthened.
Capacity Development: Procurement training activities have been relatively limited, except for awareness workshops
to disseminate the Act. The capacity building strategy is yet t o be implemented. I t includes strengthening the
procurement syllabuses o f local training institutions to assist them in securing international professional accreditation
and the establishment o f procurement as a career in the public service.
Integrity of the public procurement system: Internal controls and external scrutiny are yet t o be reinforced. The
Appeals and Complaints Review Panel inaugurated o n February 23,2007, i s not yet operational. I t would benefit f r o m
stronger private sector and c i v i l society representation and the dissemination o f its rules and procedures through public
awareness campaigns. An IDF grant has recently approved by the W o r l d Bank t o strengthen the Ghana Audit agencies
t o carry out specialized audits in the areas o f public procurement. I t i s important to ensure close coordination with the
Public Procurement Board to address specific training to the auditors. Joint working arrangements with relevant
institutions for auditing o f procurement activities and following-up o n audit findings.

PARTNERSHIP - PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE

15.
To meet Ghana’s development goals, government and partners have co-signed a set of
partnershipprinciples that are fully consistent with the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. An
Aid Effectiveness and Harmonization Action Plan i s part o f the C G documentation. Harmonization
remains a challenge for partners and government, with much progress s t i l l to be made. Table 1 on
Harmonization, Alignment and Aid Effectiveness contains baseline data o n the Paris indicators for the
Bank’s support to Ghana and Bank-specific targets for 2010, based on the proposed CAS program
combined with already committed project support. Progress towards meeting 20 10 harmonization targets
will be assessed through biennial independent assessments o f mutual accountability and Paris Declaration
surveys.

16.
As committed to in the GJAS, the Bank i s aligning on government’s programs and
strategies, increasingly using harmonized aid modalities, such as development policy lending,
sector-wide approaches, and joint analyticaland technical advisory services, and relying more and
more on government processes and systems. Government has stated that budget support i s i t s
preferred aid modality. This CAS sees a shift to increasing use o f DPO instruments. As sector budget
support increases, linkages between sector dialogues and the overarching framework for general budget
support, the MDBS, are becoming crucial. This implies an empowered role for the sector groups and a
central role o f MoFEP in resource allocation. The PRSC i s embedded in an M D B S framework with a
rolling three-year Progress Assessment Framework, covering the three GPRS I1pillars. M D B S dialogue
with government determines the content, triggers and benchmarks. Current Board guidance i s to limit the
number o f triggers to n o more than ten. For sectors where conditions emerge for program-based budget
support, the sector D P O may offer the more appropriate vehicle for a group o f partners engage in a r i c h
outcome-oriented policy dialogue, rather than the established M D B S framework. In Ghana, there i s
explicit complementarily between the M D B S PAF and the emerging sector D P O PAFs, as, for example,
in the upcoming AgDPOs and NREG DPOs. Investment lending will s t i l l play an important role,
particularly in regional infrastructure. With the proposed shift in aid modalities to a greater use o f
development policy financing, an appropriate policy and institutional framework i s needed. Table 2
provides an assessment o f the policy and institutional framework that are in place both at the national
level and at the sector level. At present, there are varying degrees o f readiness in the sectors for
development policy support. A better roadmap i s needed in some sectors to provide the necessary preconditions. If pre-conditions are not met, other modalities such as pooled funds and technical assistance
will be considered. In procurement, it i s clear that operations training o f sectoral staff as well as
strengthening o f oversight mechanisms will be key. Since development policy operations i s a new area
for some sector teams, they will seek guidance on best practice from other countries.
New lending under the CAS i s split evenly between investment (50%) and development
17.
policy operations (50%). When the already committed investment portfolio from the on-going CAS i s
added, the ratios are 70% investment lending to 30% budget support. Projections o f disbursements during
the CAS period from already approved and new proposed programs suggest that about 60% o f flows to
Ghana will be for investment projects and about 40% will be as budget support.

18. Analytical and Advisory Assistance. As Ghana evolves out o f a low-income paradigm, the World
Bank’s role in providing AAA must improve. The CAS C R underlines the need for AAA work to be
well-anchored in government’s working agenda to have impact. Furthermore, there i s strong capacity in
Ghana to undertake analytical work and numerous work already exists. Choices on future AAA therefore
need to take these factors into account. During the last CAS period, services included a CEM, a Poverty
and Social Impact Assessment (PSIA) in Energy, Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA)
(update) Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR), Public Expenditure Review (PER), ERPFM,
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) updates and follow-ups, a trade study, a Country
Environmental Assessment, a youth employment study and a Ghana productivity study. However, the
QAG assessment o f AAA in 2006 suggested that a thorough analysis o f developments in key sectors such
as agriculture, manufacturing and services, and an analysis o f the incidence and efficiency o f public
expenditures be carried out. These recommendations will be addressed through the forthcoming CEM, as
well as in other work listed in Table 3.

A comprehensive review o f AAA will be undertaken during 2008 to determine the future
AAA program, taking into account both government’s
evolving needs and opportunities for

Ghana also stands to benefit from planned regional analytical pieces in a number o f areas. This
includes a West Africa Minerals Sector Strategic Assessment and a global warming impact assessment in
West Africa. A strategy for regional cooperation in the development o f networks o f researchers,
professional and science and technology will also be considered. Moreover, a joint program with
ECOWAS i s envisaged to support the analytical and the operational implications o f removing behind-the-

IFC provides advisory services mainly through the I F C Private Enterprise Partnership for Africa

were launched last year: (i)

Ghana Leasing Program,

22.
IFC. Since Ghana became a member in 1958, IFC has invested over $636 million in 43 projects
in Ghana, with $364 million for i t s own account and an additional $272 million in syndicated loans. I F C
has greatly expanded i t s investment services and advisory solutions portfolio in Ghana over the past two
years. IFC investment commitments in Ghana currently stand at $177 million invested in 17 projects,
with a strong pipeline o f new investments under development. In FY06, IFC’s Private Enterprise
Partnership for Africa launched four new advisory solutions programs in Ghana, supporting education,
the financial sector, leasing, and housing finance. IFC’s strategy in Ghana includes supporting private
provision o f infrastructure, deepening the domestic financial sector, expanding opportunities for micro,
small and medium enterprises borrowing through local financial institutions, promoting the development
o f non-traditional exports, and enhancing the business environment. Specific I F C activities are discussed
under the pillars above.
MIGA. MIGA’s current program in Ghana consists o f support for 4 projects, totaling $185.2
23.
million o f gross guarantee coverage, representing 3.9% o f the Agency’s portfolio. Exposure in Ghana i s
the second largest for MIGA in Sub-Saharan Africa, after Mozambique. The projects supported in Ghana
are: West Africa Gas Pipeline Company Ltd. Ghana ($75m), Barclays Bank o f Ghana Ltd. ($4.9m),
Scancom Ltd. ($99m), and Meridian Development Ltd. ($6.3m). MIGA has been approached by several
investors for project support in various sectors. All underwriting remains at an early stage. Going
forward, MIGA’s interest in Ghana i s supporting private sector projects in the energy sector, although
MIGA remains open to all eligible investments in the financial, extractive, agribusiness, manufacturing
and services sectors. Increasingly Ghana i s seeking to develop i t s industrial base and i s looking to foreign
know-how to move this effort forward. MIGA will work with the country’s investment agency on the
technical side and i s willing to provide guarantees, if investors seek assurances.

RESOURCES - FINANCING OF FUTURE OPERATIONS

24.
IDA’SF Y 0 7 performance-based allocation for Ghana, after netting out the impact o f the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative, i s SDR158.5 million, or approximately $240 million at today’s
exchange rates. With Board approva1,of the four operations scheduled for discussion in June 2007, this
fiscal year’s actual lending will total $260 million in IDA, $250 million o f which will count against

latter factor will be determined annually by the joint assessment o f the Bank and the IMF regarding
Ghana’s debt sustainability, as articulated in the Debt Sustainability Analysis (see B o x 10). Ghana
currently has “green light” status with IDA and receives financing at traditional IDA credit terms. This
status will continue through FYO8 - since based on the DSA it would not be expected to lead to a
deterioration in Ghana’s debt sustainability prospects - and will be re-assessed in 2008 for determining
the concessionality o f IDA terms in FY09.

26.
I t i s critical that Ghana pursues a prudent stance on non-concessional debt, in terms of both
borrowingvolumes and the choice o f projects to be financed by non-concessionalmeans. In this
regard, there are three considerations that should inform Ghana’s strategy. First, an increase in the risk o f
debt distress, for example following higher volume or less-concessional-than-anticipated external
borrowing, could lead to a change in Ghana’s status from a “green light” to a “yellow light” country.
“Yellow light” countries receive 50% o f their IDA commitments in the form o f grants with an
accompanying 10 percent cut in the overall volume o f commitments. Second, because Ghana i s a
beneficiary o f the MDRI, IDA’s policy on non-concessional borrowing applies, and the terms and volume
o f future IDA allocations to Ghana could be affected by government’s non-concessional borrowing if this
were seen to undermine long-run debt sustainability. T h i s i s currently not the case. Third, other donors
and concessional lenders may also adjust their financing levels depending on Ghana’s external financing
strategy. As such, it i s important that the focus o f non-concessional borrowing be o n financing highreturn, revenue-generating investments which will not add to the country’s debt burden. In addition, the
implementation o f viable sector strategies will be key to maximizing the returns on private borrowing and
to leveraging private sector finance in projects. The W o r l d Bank i s committed to working with
government to assess the viability o f potential public investments, to assist with the development of a
value-for-money function within government, and to help government maximize the benefits o f private
sector financing. A well designed, medium-term borrowing strategy, including effective coordination
between government, donors, and creditors will be an important tool to secure adequate and predictable
external resources.
27.
While there are many factors that will influence the size o f IDA’s program in Ghana this
CAS presents an indicativelending program that assumes IDA lending levels similar to those o f the
IDA14 period in real terms (excluding the accommodation of MDRI): approximately $315 million
per year. However, as one o f the top performers in Afiica, Ghana could productively absorb higher
levels o f IDA should more resources become available through the IDA15 replenishment.
28.
Government has made clear to the Bank and to other development partners that additional
resources are needed to finance critical infrastructure investments over the coming four years, and
has asked partners to explore the possibility of providing additional concessional resources above
the current $1.3 billion that was provided in 2006. While greater efficiencies and better prioritization
should be sought in the use o f existing public resources (Ghana’s investment to GDP rate i s already high
at 30%), i t i s estimated that an additional $150 million to $450 million could be usefully absorbed in
Ghana in order to accelerate growth and meet MDG targets. Ghana has been put forward to the
international community as a prime candidate for scaling up aid to high-performing Afkican countries and
i t i s in this context that additional IDA resources could serve as both a catalyst for bilateral and other
multilateral co-financing as well as an anchor in terms o f technical expertise in some areas where the
Bank has a comparative advantage among partners. Inparticular, in case the IDA15 replenishment allows
for a larger overall IDA envelope, additional IDA resources could be used to scale-up support to energy,
water and public sector reform, and could also serve to complement the Bank’s program with additional
interventions in the area o f social protection and post-basic education, science and technology.

25

29.
The Bank will work with other partners to bring additional resources to bear in Ghana and
to realize the commitments made by partners at global meetings. As a recipient o f significant MDRI
relief, Ghana n o w has additional fiscal space and i s in the position to pursue other non-IDA sources of
financing. This situation stresses the important role the Bank can play o n a number o f fronts including:
(i)
engaging with government in evaluating public investment alternatives; (ii)
advising government on
policy choices that will affect the productivity o f investment as well as the attractiveness o f sectoral
investments to the private sector; (iii)
catalyzing additional concessional resources from other potential
Box 10: Debt Sustainability
One o f the main issues confronting the Bank and other development partners supporting the implementation o f
GPRS 11, i s the government’s stated intention to access international capital markets t o help find i t s development
program. This decision should, however, take into account the need to maintain a prudent borrowing strategy going
forward. The result o f the joint Bank-IMF debt sustainability analysis suggests that Ghana’s risk o f debt distress i s
moderate, albeit close to the l o w risk category. Indeed, the decision to categorize the risk o f debt distress as
moderate rather than l o w is, in part, t o err o n the side o f caution. This debt sustainability analysis incorporates nonconcessional borrowing o f ~ $ 7 0 m0 i l l i o n over the next three years, plus continued annual market access of about 1
percent o f G D P for the rest o f the projection period. In making these assumptions about non-concessional
borrowing, the analysis attempts to b e realistic with regard to commercial borrowing volumes and to illustrate the
value o f prudence and the importance o f the judicious use o f non-concessional funds. The two other elements o f the
analysis are: (i)
continued macroeconomic stabilization (prudent fiscal stance, single-digit inflation); and (ii)
perseverance with the pace o f structural reforms (public financial management (PFM) and reforms o f state-owned
enterprises (SOEs), including divestiture. In the meantime, remittances are assumed t o remain constant as a share o f
G D P (at 15 percent), while FDI inflows are expected to increase gradually. International reserves would exceed 4
months o f imports at the end o f the projection period.
The m a i n endogenous factor contributing t o this positive debt sustainability outlook is the strong projected real G D P
growth - contributing o n average to a 1.7 percentage point decline in the stock o f external debt to G D P ratio
between n o w and the end o f the projection period (2026). The contribution coming f r o m higher G D P growth i s
partially offset however by rising interest payments, reducing the net effect o f the endogenous factors to 0.9 percent.
In addition, net current transfers, namely remittances inflows and official transfers, and foreign direct investment
flows are expected to contribute o n average with 18 percentage points o f GDP, M h e r adding to the decline in the
external debt to G D P ratio during this period. I t i s important to note that these inflows (i.e., net transfers and net
foreign investment) are expected to increase f r o m the historical average o f just over 13 percent o f G D P during
1995-2005, to 18 percent o f GDP during 2007-201 1 period, triggered by the country’s stable macroeconomic
environment.

partners, and (iv) leveraging private sector finance for specific investments. Towards this end, the Bank
will seek opportunities to crowd in other financing from both traditional and new donor partners (such as
China). This financing can take the form o f co-financing o f IDA-financed investments or parallel
financing o f an overall investment program where there i s a common platform o f policies supported by
interested stakeholders. The W o r l d Bank can assist not only in terms o f technical expertise and presence
in country, but also can help provide coherence in the coordination o f various partners who are interested
in supporting a given initiative. The World Bank will also work together with government to explore
options for leveraging private finance for infrastructure investments, particularly in the energy sector.
The W o r l d Bank i s keen to explore ways to use i t s broad range o f instruments, including IFC, IDA and
MICA guarantees, and possibly IBRD enclave guarantees, to reduce the cost to government o f private
sector financing and to maximize the benefits o f public-private partnerships for the country. Government
has expressed an interest in borrowing from IBRD in order to complement IDA’Sassistance and to
enlarge the overall resource envelope it i s receiving f i o m the Bank. An IBRD creditworthiness
assessment was undertaken in late 2006, and Ghana was found not yet eligible for IBRD borrowing.
Nonetheless, the Bank will work with government to explore other financing possibilities outside o f
traditional IDA borrowing over the coming years with a view towards preserving long-term debt
sustainability.

26

Risks. In addition to the risks identified in the G-JAS to the collective partnership, four types o f
30.
risks are worth flagging for the W o r l d Bank program. Political risks: The political cycle, with
presidential and parliamentary elections in December 2008, may challenge policy and implementation
plans. As noted in the CAS Completion Report, a strong awareness o f the political cycle i s needed when
programming new activities. The program needs to be flexible to respond to the needs o f the incoming
administration after elections. The new work on growth and poverty provides such an opportunity, as
does the readiness to prepare specific policy notes as requested by government. Economic risks: A
shifting global economic environment, including commodity price impact on the terms o f trade, may
provide a less favorable environment for Ghana’s economic growth. While difficult to deal with,
development partners need to have flexibility to mitigate such external shock, including the use o f
MDBS. Economic risks on which government has an influence relate in particular to the financial
vulnerability o f the energy sector and i t s impact o n growth, domestic pressures on the budget posing
strains on the macro-stability, in particular the wage bill and the possibility that investments financed by
new non-concessional borrowing may not yield high enough returns, thereby affecting the country’s debt
sustainability. These issues are central to the Bank’s engagement, both in AAA and operations. I t will be
essential to continue the high-level dialogue on energy strategy, even as the GEDAP, regional and other
financing instruments are taken forward. The fiscal issues need to be addressed in the context o f the
MDBS, but also through increased engagement o n budget issues with specific sectors and in public sector
reform. Regarding debt sustainability, the Bank will seek to provide advice o n the specific investments,
and the best way to reduce the burden on government, while achieving the returns to the economy,
including in particular seeking solutions involving the private sector. In addition, value-for-money AAA
will be used to strengthen the capacity o f government to identify high-return projects in a systematic way,
as part o f the medium-term expenditure framework. Social Stability Risk: Deepening regional and
urban disparities could threaten Ghana’s traditionally strong social fabric. Although Ghana has shown a
strong resilience to the regional challenges o f conflict or poor governance, unexpected spillovers from
regional events may pose new challenges if internal inequalities remain unaddressed. Through C E M
analytic work and complementary poverty analysis the Bank will work with government and partners to
better understand the links between poverty, growth and inequality, identify specific policy levers
including the emerging employment agenda. Inadequate Support: Lastly, inadqueate levels o f
concessional finance or policy reversals by partners could adversely affect Ghana’s strong developmental
progress. While not considered a likely risk during this CAS period, the W o r l d Bank would work with
development partners through the strong partnership mechanisms, including the C G framework, to
enhance predictability and ensure that potential causes o f declining aid flows could be addressed at an
early stage.

CONCLUSION

On the back o f strong public policy, Ghana has accelerated economic growth, surpassing the
3 1.
levels o f previous decades. In turn, poverty levels have come down, poising the country to be one o f the
first in Africa to reach the poverty MDG in 2008, well ahead o f schedule. O n the basis o f strong
governance, a vibrant public policy debate i s guiding choices that underlie the country’s development
strategy. Partners have stepped up support considerably, in increasingly harmonized frameworks. Ghana
i s set to achieve yet higher results, o n the basis o f own resources and external finance, in an ambiance o f
strong partnership. Yet, recent fiscal strains, continued vulnerability to commodity price fluctuations and
the external economic environment, s t i l l u n d e r h d e d investments and maintenance o f the infrastructure
base, and a backlog o f many other developmental challenges may constrain the private-sector led
acceleration o f growth that i s a main pillar in the country’s chosen strategy. And while poverty on
average i s declining, severe poverty i s persistent, old and new inequalities and disparities are present, and
too few better-paying formal jobs are being created. Ghana can claim credit for considerable progress to
achieve i t s objectives, but many Ghanaians also feel that the country can do better for economic growth to
be shared equitably and sustainably. Partners, the World Bank among them, are committed to intensify
their engagement. Prospects for scaling-up exist. The framework o f results, resources and partnership o f
the Consultative Group provides strong guidelines on what to achieve. In that context, this C A S aims to
sustain Ghana’s economic growth, surpass the MDG on poverty, and start to reduce inequalities.
Employment creation may become a key focus for the future. On the basis o f Ghana’s vibrant public
policy debate and stronger evidence-based public policy choice, Ghana has a golden opportunity, in i t s
50” year o f independence, to stake out i t s course, and eventually achieve middle-income status, the
Millennium Development Goals, and i t s overall national aspirations.

GHANA COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY FY04-07
COMPLETION REPORT

INTRODUCTION

The Ghana Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report (CASCR) evaluates the performance
in implementing the World Bank’s C A S for FY04-07, and highlights lessons for the new assistance

strategy for FY08-11.5
11.

GHANA’S STRATEGIC GOALS AND THE RELEVANCE OF THE CAS

The Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy 2003-2005 (GPRS), which was formulated in 2003
against a backdrop o f deteriorating macroeconomic indicators, focused o n restoring macroeconomic
stability to achieve greater poverty reduction. The Government articulated i t s strategy around five pillars.
The first two pillars aimed to accelerate economic growth over the medium to long term, the third and
fourth focused on achieving the human development targets under the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs), and the fifth emphasized governance, empowering the people, and better service delivery:
0

Ensure sound economic management for accelerated growth, including lowering the fiscal
deficit, effective revenue mobilization, l o w and competitive interest rates, and better management
o f public expenditures to target the poor;
Increase production and employment by creating the right institutional environment for
business development, promoting ago-processing, ensuring a reliable supply o f high quality
energy services, improving natural resource management, and using information and
communication technology (ICT) to further enhance development efforts;

0

Promote human development and provide basic services, including removing the obstacles to
access and utilization, by the poor, o f basic education, health care, population control, good
drinhng water, and improved sanitation;

0

Implement special programs for the vulnerable and excluded by setting up systems to provide
resources to improve conditions o f extreme poverty and social deprivation for people living with
HIV/AIDS, those in deprived areas, the disabled, people affected by disasters, children under
five, and women needing quality obstetric care; and

0

Ensure good governance through accountability and transparency by strengthening the
leadership and oversight functions o f the Executive and Parliament to ensure effective
implementation o f the GPRS, empowering the people to participate effectively in the
development process, and decentralizing responsibilities and improving public sector
management for better service delivery at the local level.

Within these broad goals, IDA founded i t s program o n three pillars linked to implementing the
growth and employment (GPRS Pillars 1 and 2); (ii)
human development and service delivery
GPRS: (i)
(GPRS Pillars 3 and 4); and (iii)
governance for empowerment (GPRS Pillar 5).
The Board o f Executive Directors approved the FY04-07 C A S o n M a r c h 16,2004 (Report No. 27838-GH), and the
FY04-07 C A S Progress Report on June 15,2006 (Report No. 36127-GH). Although the C A S followed the Results
Framework, it was not a formal results-based CAS.

40

The CAS was aligned well with the GPRS, and set out to support Ghana’s growth, based on a
core foundation o f macroeconomic stability and good public financial management, supplemented by
needed sectoral reforms. The Bank consulted widely during the early design o f the CAS and provided the
opportunity for input from government, development partners, and civil society organizations in all ten
regions o f Ghana. By the end o f FY07, the Bank will have delivered a CAS lending program o f $1,183.9
million, higher than the planned $1,055 million, reflecting the country’s steadily improving policy
performance over the period, moving from a CPIA rating o f 3.5 in 2002 to 3.9 in 2005. The composition
o f the C A S program has remained intact, excepting the decentralization project that has been postponed to
FY09, and with further articulation o f the Bank’s engagement in infrastructure in the form o f support to
the ICT and urban transport sectors. IDA’Ssupport over this period, in terms o f lending, analytical work
and policy dialogue, has contributed to Ghana’s remarkable achievements in growth and poverty
reduction--the overarching goals o f both the GPRS and the CAS. By improving policies and institutions,
and investing in infrastructure and basic services, Ghana has increased economic growth from an average
o f 4.5% over 1983-2000 to an average o f 6% over 2004-2006. As a result, poverty headcount levels have
declined dramatically, from 51.7% in 1991192 to 39.5% in 1998199 and further to 28.5% in 2005106,
lifting 1.7 million people out o f poverty during the last five years (Fifth Ghana Living Standards and
Measurement Survey-GLSS5, April 2007). Ghana i s likely to be the first Sub-Saharan African country
to cross the threshold o f the MDG o f reducing poverty by h a l f compared to i t s level in the early 1990s.
Overall, the Bank has played a vital role in financing Ghana’s progress towards GPRS goals,
and in contributing to fundamental policy reforms in public financial management, education, health,
and water. T h e program has supported the continuation o f macroeconomic stability and key investments
in infrastructure and basic services. Progress, as measured by the C A S indicators, has been substantial in
most areas; however, many indicators do not capture key IDA interventions in significant areas such as
agriculture, private sector development, and HIVIAIDS; some indicators are poorly defined or lack data;
and targets have been set for 2007, when the latest available data at the time o f this report are usually
from 2004 or 2005, making judgment about progress difficult. Therefore, the CASCR supplements CAS
indicators with relevant measures, such as key performance indicators under Bank programs in several
areas, to evaluate the impact.of the Bank program under each CAS pillar. This reveals a shortcoming of
the FY04-07 CAS -its results framework, which includes outcomes that are not sufficiently linked to
the Bank’s program and lacks adequate milestones to monitor progress.

L

In preparing the next CAS, the Bank team will attempt to identify indicators and benchmarks that
are better linked to IDA interventions, have a direct bearing on the issues and expected outcomes o f
government’s strategy, and can be monitored over a relevant time frame to evaluate the contribution of
the IDA program towards Ghana’s development goals.

RESULTS ASSESSMENT

Pillar 1: Growth and Employment
A.
Managing public finances for macroeconomic stability and poverty reduction. The C A S
shared the main objective o f the GPRS -to achieve annual GDP growth rates o f 5% to generate jobs and
cut poverty. Ghana surpassed its goal, with growth rates averaging 5.6% in 2003-05 and 6.2% in 2006.
The government took several measures to create macroeconomic stability, including reducing and
restructuring the domestic debt, and improving public expenditure management and fiscal resource
mobilization -all o f which were central elements o f the Bank’s policy dialogue with GoG.

10. Forest cover: expand from 20,000 hectares in 2002 to
80,000 hectares by end 2007

Forest plantation cover expanded to 93,298 (2006), which includes
69,748 under the plantation development system. Target
exceeded.
Access to internet services increased to 1.5 million by third quarter
o f 2006. Target exceeded.

1 1. Increased access to internet services from 20,000 users
in 2002 to 100,000 users in 2007.

The reduction of domestic debt has been a cornerstone offiscalpolicy over the past few years,
leading to a downward trend in the debt/GDP ratio from 24% in 2002 to 10.8% in 2005. Despite this
progress, fiscal slippages in 2006 resulted in an increase in this indicator to 13.8%. Ample domestic and
international liquidity has allowed interest rates to gradually ease down, alongside inflation. Nominal
interest rates f e l l from 25% in January 2003 to 9.9% in January 2007, in line with lower inflation rates,
which fell from 30% in 2003 to 10% at end-2006.

IDA’S support tofiscal strengthening was provided mainly through a series of Poverty
Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) introduced in 2003, and aligned with GPRS and budget priorities.
The PRSCs focused on creating space for financing development by helping to pay down the debt stock,
through macro and public financial management reforms, and a reduction in subsidies to petroleum
consumption. The Bank advanced the policy dialogue in the energy and power sectors through the PRSC,
and helped to implement the petroleum deregulation program, which permitted imports o f crude o i l and
6

The C A S text and Results Matrix differ in the definition o f t h i s indicator. The text refers t o ‘increasing povertyrelated expenditures by 3% annually’, and the matrix refers t o ‘increasing total poverty-related non-salary
expenditures by 3% o f G D P annually.’ The CASCR assumes a third definition, ‘increasing non-wage povertyrelated expenditures as a share o f GDP’, which i s the indicator measured in Ghana and used in the PRSC.

42

refined products through competitive tendering under the supervision o f an independent regulatory
agency. G o G also moved to allow petroleum prices to reflect world market prices and costs o f
production, although with some costly delays during the election period. Petroleum subsidies were
reduced significantly, and the budget strengthened. Current power prices, however, remain at about half
o f the cost o f supply, depleting the finances o f the power utility and putting a strain on the national
budget. Nevertheless, overall prudent fiscal management has contributed to reducing the interest costs in
the budget and increasing the share o f credit available to the private sector, from 50% o f total domestic
credit in 2004 to 60% by mid-2006. The CAS objective was h l l y met.
Budget allocations to poverty-related programs as a share of GDP increasedfairly steadily,
from 4.8% in 2002, to 8.5% in 2005 and 8.7% in 2006. These increases were mainly due to greater basic
education and primary health care spending. T h e wage component o f total poverty expenditures in
education f e l l from 85% in 2003 to 79% in 2005, and in health, it declined fi-om 76% in 2003 to 55% in

2005. However, the wage bill as a proportion o f total poverty-related expenditures remained persistently
high, leaving less o f the increased poverty-related spending for non-wage expenditures. In general, the
wage bill issue continues to plague the government, with wages as a share o f GDP remaining in the 8.5%
to 9% range throughout the periode7The CAS benchmark for increasing non-wage, poverty-related
expenditures as a share o f GDP was also fully met.
B.
Removing constraints to private sector investment. Ghana n o w ranks above average among
the African nations in many o f the indicators in the Bank’s “Doing Business Report”, and, in 2006, was
recognized as one o f the world’s top ten reformers in terms o f improving the business environment.
However, with a ranking of 94 out of 175 economies in overall “ease of doing business”, further
improvements are necessary in improving procedures for exporting and importing, establishing a private
credit bureau system, upgrading contract enforcement, and facilitating the posting o f collateral by
reducing the time needed to register property and new businesses. IDA supported the private sector
development (PSD) agenda through the PRSCs, complemented by several investments in agriculture and
transport, and by critical analytical studies in Telecommunications and Energy. Funds under the Public
Enterprise and Privatization TA project (PEPTA) were used to clear the backlog o f court cases to assist in
the speedy resolution o f commercial cases. PEPTA also financed the automation o f the Registrar
General’s Department for business registration and contributed to reducing direct business registration
times; though the total number o f days (81) required for registering a new business remains high.8 The
Trade and Investment Gateway project helped to create a joint venture with the private sector to
modernize the functions o f the Customs Department. The Ghana Community Network (GCNET)
company operation has been largely successful, reducing the time required to clear customs from over 2.5
days to less than 6 hours, and the total administrative steps from 13 to 3. Revenues fi-om customs
increased by 49% within the first year, and went up by another 45% in the second year o f operations.
N e w systems allow customs officers to easily determine the shipments that required to be audited, define
the risk profile o f traders, retain the records o f their activities, and identify patterns to fight customs fraud.
In power, roads and telecommunications, the government aimed to improve the business climate
to attract private sector participation in infrastructure services (Table 1, indicators 6-8). Ghana‘s
performance has been uneven in the energy sector; while GoG took bold steps to reduce petroleum
subsidies, introduce a market-referenced pricing formula, and set up a transparent regulatory framework,
reforms in the power sub-sector have been slow to materialize. For example, (i)
utility prices need to

This i s 2 to 3 percentage points o f G D P higher than in a number o f countries that have been able to match o r
surpass Ghana’s economic achievements.
These business registration numbers are f r o m the Bank’s D o i n g Business survey, and represent an estimate based
o n the legal requirements to register a business. G o G contends that the “Company Seal”, which requires 40 days to
acquire, i s not necessary t o register a business and should n o t be included in the business registration time.

adjust to reflect the rising cost o f power generation, which has been influenced by an increasing reliance
o n thermal sources; (ii)
the financial viability o f the power utility company, Volta River Authority
(VRA), needs to be restored; and (iii)
the management o f the Electricity Company o f Ghana (ECG) i s in
need o f strengthening. A sector reform framework has been in place since 2003, but implementation has
been slow and uncoordinated. In addition, the sector has suffered from the provision o f power to the
Volta Aluminum Company (VALCO) at subsidized rates. Total distribution losses have continued to
increase, and current estimates range between 23% and 26% (25.4% as at end-2005), with estimates as
high as 34% in the large load centers. Transmission losses are about 3%. The success o f the regional
energy portfolio (including the West Africa Power Pool Project and the West Afkica Gas Pipeline Project)
i s threatened by the financial weaknesses o f VRA. The Bank has pursued an intensive dialogue with
government o n energy reform over the CAS period, and has provided important financing through budget
support, investments and guarantees in the WAPP and the WAGP; the Ghana Energy Development and
Access Project (GEDAP), to be presented to the Board in early FYO8, will provide new financing for
investments in the sector. While there has been some progress, further reforms are critical for accelerated
growth, and this i s now widely recognized within the government. The power sector indicator was not
met.
The Bank has helped Ghana to address some of the major issues in the roads sector.
Investments, including through the Road Sector Development project, have significantly eased transport
bottlenecks, improved funding for road maintenance, and enhanced the capacity o f the domestic
construction industry. Road improvements have increased trips to hospitals by 20%; increased maize
prices received by farmers by 23%, reduced the cost o f traveling to market by 65%, and lowered the cost
o f traveling to welfare facilities by 41%. The fuel levy for road maintenance has increased from 3.5
centdliter in 2001 to 6.5 centdliter in 2006, with a resulting increase in the road fund from about $50
million to $1 10 million over the same period. Almost 100% o f road maintenance works are contracted to
the private sector, and the length o f the road network has increased from about 35,000 km in 2001 to
60,000 km in 2006. Management and maintenance o f the sector, however, need to be strengthened
further. A series o f studies to inform added institutional reforms, and the poverty impact are underway.
The latter should provide indicators that would need to be monitored on a regular basis to assess the
impact o f transport interventions on poverty. Ghana has achieved the CAS’S road network targets.

Telecommunications sector performance improved significantly over the past five years.
Cumulative private sector investment in the sector (2000-2005) amounts to $157m. Investment,
combined with increased competition, has resulted in: an increase in the number o f fixed and mobile
subscribers from about 3% o f the population in 2001 to about 22.5% in the third quarter o f 2006;
approximately 1.5 million Ghanaians having access to the internet; a threefold reduction in internet access
prices between 2001 and 2006; and an increase in the number o f pay phones in rural areas by about 4,998
in 2001 to 11,636 in 2006. The I C T sector’s contribution to GDP rose from 1.8% in 2000 to 6% in 2005,
average mobile tariffs fell by 5 1% between 2000 and 2006, and international call prices have become
competitive by regional standards, and are significantly lower than in countries such as Botswana and
South Africa. Ghana has been recognized as a rising global sourcing destination and i s ranked as the
leading destination in Sub-Saharan Africa. IDA has sustained i t s engagement in policy dialogue,
technical assistance and analytical work. The PEPTA project supported the development o f the National
Telecom Policy and facilitated the drafting and issuance o f formal licenses to mobile operators who had
operated for several years with informal authorizations. In collaboration with USAID, the Bank provided
support for drafting key sector legislation, and IFC provided a $40m loan to one o f the Mobile companies
in 2005. As highlighted in the CAS Progress Report, the decision was taken during the CAS period to
provide investment support, through the eGhana Project, to help Ghana further develop i t s potential in the
IT-enabled services industry. The CAS indicators in ICT have been exceeded.

44

The CAS did not appropriately specify indicators to measure progress in access to land. The
target set for reducing delays in land registration was not met due to the time required to survey land. A
better indicator might have been the time taken to register land deeds rather than land titles, given also
that Bank support through the Land Administration project (LAP) focused on GoG's program to
decentralize registration o f land deeds. LAP helped to establish four land registries outside Accra, which
have reduced the time to register deeds from over 36 months at the start o f LAP to less than seven months
to date. The project has also contributed to reducing deed registration transaction costs in the four pilot
registration centers for all sizes o f plots, and increasing access to land by women in the four centers,
although these are not captured under the CAS Results Framework.

C.
Harnessing sources o f growth. Modernized agriculturefeaturedprominently in the GPRS
and includedfivepolicy objectives and a total offififteen indicator^.^ Although the CAS recognized the
need to increase agricultural growth and productivity, and the ongoing Agriculture Services Sub-sector
Investment Project (AgSSIP) focused o n improving rural incomes and food security through higher
agricultural productivity and diversification, the CAS did not include a single indicator directly related
to agriculture. The CAS included one benchmark on nontraditional export growth, which was met due to
the impressive performance o f this sub-sector over the period. This benchmark, however, indicates the
performance o f manufacturing in Ghana, rather than the efficiency o f agriculture. Manufactured goods,
which account for three quarters o f total nontraditional exports, did well over the last five years, with
growth rates averaging just over 10 percent, led by the exports o f processed and semi-processed goods
(including many natural resource-based products, such as wood products, and tuna and frozen fish, as
well as industrial goods such as plastic products and petroleum derivatives).
Overall, the agricultural sector performed well, with growth averaging around 5% between
2001 and 2006 (compared to 2.1% in 2000), in excess of population growth estimated at 2.7% per
year." Ghana's total exports rose by 33%, driven in large part by the record performance o f cocoa
(where exports rose by 30% to just under $1.2 billion in 2006). Ghana made good progress in decreasing
post-harvest losses, improving irrigation facilities, and increasing mechanization in agriculture. IDA
addressed agricultural policy and development through the PRSCs and the AgSSIP. Under the PRSC, the
government took several measures to achieve the target o f 2% annual increase in real per capita food
production. The PRSC also provided the fiscal space for government to pursue quality enhancement
through crop spraying, and to increase farmers' share o f the cocoa price. Under the AgSSIP, two sectors
most relevant to the program -the crops and livestock sub-sectors -recorded 30% growth in real
terms, equivalent to an average increase o f 5.4% per year. The performance o f cereals and starchy crops,
however, was driven primarily by an expansion in areas under cultivation rather than from yield increases
(which remain moderate), thus threatening environmental and social sustainability. This raises concerns
over the impact o f Ghana's research system in technology generation and transfer, which should be
monitored further under the next CAS." Given the importance o f modernized agriculture in GPRSII, and
IDA'Scontinued involvement in the area, the new CAS should consider alternative indicators.'*

The five objectives were: ensuring food security; rehabilitation o f the fisheries sector; provision o f irrigation
facilities; increased mechanization o f agriculture; and improved non-fann rural incomes.
lo
Data are f r o m MOFNPPMED. There are a number o f different estimates o f agricultural GDP, with significant
differences between sources. As part o f the AgSSIP ICR, MOFA will need t o work with Ghana Statistical Services
(GSS) to agree o n a consistent set o f sub-sector statistics for the purposes o f monitoring.
I' The capacity o f farmer-based organizations in production and marketing, however, is steadily increasing.
Likewise, important steps have been taken t o mainstream gender into agricultural policy making and in the delivery
o f extension services. The GLSSS (April 2007) gives a full assessment o f the impact o f these growth rates o n rural
household incomes and welfare indicators.
l2
These could include percentage post-harvest losses, share o f household incomes spent o n food, yield increases o f
selected crops and livestock or three-year averages o f agricultural yields, per capita production o f key staple foods

45

The Bank advanced the dialogue in natural resource management ( N M ) through the PRSCs
and two key analyticalpieces, which have laid the basis for a government-led, multi-donor sector
approach in the forthcoming CAS. The CAS target for forest cover, which was the GPRS Plantation
Development Strategy target, was met. The government faced the challenge o f increasing forest cover
while at the same time ensuring food security and higher household incomes. The government took the
approach o f using funds under the National Forest Plantations Development Fund, HIPC, and debt
forgiveness funds to support rehabilitation o f degraded areas, including forest reserves, through direct
plantation development or a modified taungya system (MTS). The M T S allowed rural farmers to enter
degraded forest reserves and grow food crops and timber trees side by side until the timber trees created a
closed canopy. M T S has contributed to increases in production o f key staples such as plantain, cocoyam,
maize and vegetables over the past 3-4 years.

Pillar 2: Human Development and Service Delivery

A.
Reduce poverty. Ghana‘s higher GDPgrowth has contributed to an impressive reduction in
poverty over the last 5-6 years. The share o f the population in poverty fell from 5 1.7% in 1991/92 to
39.5% in 1998/99 and further to 28.5% in 2005/06, placing Ghana o n the path to halving poverty from i t s
level in the early 1990s, well before the target MDG date o f 2015.13 As a result, there are 5 million fewer
people in poverty in Ghana today than would have been the case without poverty reduction. Furthermore,
despite significant population growth, the number o f poor people was reduced by 1.7 million, from 7.9
million in 1991 to 6.2 million in 2006. Despite this remarkable achievement, there are concerns that
inequality has increased, and that the national pattern masks disparities in performance by geographic
region. In the northern regions o f Ghana, poverty remains widespread, even if it has decreased as well in
recent years. Poverty fell by about 16 points in urban areas, and by 23 points in rural areas. Within the
urban areas, the urban savannah areas remain the poorest. In the rural areas, while there has been a large
drop in poverty in the coastal and forest areas, the decline was smaller in the rural savannah areas,
increasing the gap between the regions.
B.
Increase access to sustainable and safe water supply and environmental sanitation services.
The CAS has contributed significantly to reforms in the water sector, to helping communities manage
rural water supply, and to GoG’s efforts to scale up access to potable water and safe sanitation. About
750,000 people in 2,014 communities gained access to improved water supply and sanitation in the last
four years under the rural water project, Community Water and Sanitation Project I1(CWSP 11),
exceeding the project’s target by 36%. The number o f boreholes and school latrines also exceeded the
targets set by the project. Over the CAS period, the Community Based Rural Development Project
(CBRD) has contributed to providing access to over 280,000 people in rural areas. The Urban Water
project i s targeting a total o f 50,000 new connections to serve close to 600,000 people. Ghana’s
sanitation delivery, however, has been weak, as institutional responsibilitiesfor sanitation remain
dispersed. Major advances are required in sanitation delivery in the next few years if the gains in water
supply delivery and other environmental sanitation interventions are to be sustained.
I n addition to helping improve water supply services, the Bank’s work has helped to empower
communities toplay a key role in planning, implementation and, most importantly, in managing the
completed water and sanitation facilities. This coupled with the targeted capacity building o f districts
and communities has contributed to the sustainability o f these interventions and strengthened the overall
rural water program. Under the Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Project (STWSSP), 42
(crops, livestock and fish), revenues f r o m food versus cash crops, subsistence versus marketed output, and baseline
and end-of GPRS I1period levels o f incomes f r o m agriculture (percentage change) as reported in the GLSS.
l3GLSSS, April 2007.

46

District Assemblies in six regions are actively involved in project implementation. The role o f the private
sector in providing services has been recognized as a key policy provision, complementing the
sustainability o f the investments through vital supply chains. Donor coordination has seen remarkable
progress, and the Sector Ministry i s exercising much stronger leadership in sector planning and
coordination. Regarding urban water, the Bank has actively engaged government and other stakeholders
over the last ten years, and this dialogue has resulted in the introduction o f the private sector in the
management o f the urban water utility. The community water target has nearly been met and i s expected
to be exceeded by the time o f Board consideration o f this report; however, the rural sanitation target has
not been met, and the urban water target has not been met due to delays in project implementation.
C.
Combat HIVIAIDS. The HIV/AIDSprevalence among pregnant women has declinedfrom
3.6% in 2004 to 2.7% in 2005, thereby exceeding the CAS target. Prevalence among 15-24 year old
youth, which i s used as a proxy for new infections, has declined from 2.5% in 2004 to 1.9% in 2005.
Bank support has been successful in expanding the community, MDA and district response to HIV/AIDS.
The Ghana AIDS Response Fund (GARFUND)provided support to P L W H A s and Orphans and
Vulnerable Children (OVCs). 30,000 PLWHAs and 17,500 OVCs benefited from different kinds o f
support, from payment o f school fees and provision o f nutritional supplements to medical assistance.

The Bank’s M A P repeater project (MSHAP, FY06) i s pooling funds initially with DFID and i s
supporting the implementation o f the National Response. The health team recommends replacing the
CAS’S H I V / A I D S indicators with indicators from the National Response M&E plan, such as: HIV
prevalence among young people aged 15 - 24 years (target i s 1.9% by 2010, and this has already been
met); percentage age o f infants born to HIV-positive mothers who are infected (target by 20 10 i s 15%);
percent age o f national H I V / A I D S funds spent o n selected vulnerable groups including ART (CSW,
M S M , Prisoners) (target o f 10% by 2010); and execution rate o f total H I V / A I D S allocation o f the key
MDAs (MOE, MOH, MoLG, Dept. o f Social Welfare) (target o f 90% by 2010). For example, rather than
counting the number o f people receiving Anti-retroviral (ARV), the next C A S could use the national
indicator: the percent age o f people with advanced HIV infection receiving Anti-retroviral Treatment
(ART) (3.2% in 2005). T h i s figure has increased to 11% in 2006. The Ghana AIDS Commission faces
the challenge o f collating data from various sources and updating the M&E Framework. Partners are
working with them to improve their capacity to provide data.
D.
Achieve quality universal education. Ghana has made good progress in education, especially
in terms of reaching the poorest communities and in improving girls’ access. Access to primary and
junior secondary schools improved, and following government’s decision to increase education budget
support to 53 deprived districts, the gross enrollment rate there increased to 80% in 2004 from 71% in
2002. Girls’ access to school also improved from 66% to 72% during the same period. Student scores in
English and math have improved over the past ten years across income levels. The PRSCs, the Education
Sector Project, and the Education for All Fast Track Initiative supported GoG’s program to introduce
innovative and comprehensive reforms in education, including the removal o f fees, the introduction o f
capitation grants, the distribution o f core textbooks, and the transfer o f budgetary resources to districts.
The capitation grants, which were introduced first in primary schools in the 40 deprived districts in 2004,
and then extended to all primary and junior secondary schools nation-wide in 2005, have l e d to even
higher enrollment rates. l4
The gains in enrollment and participation have brought quality of learning and completion rates
under increasing pressure, as classrooms become more crowded and teacher-pupil ratios increase. The
Basic Education Certificate Exams (BECE) show decline nationwide and persistent disparities at the
l4Forty deprived districts were initially identified for direct support. The number o f deprived districts increased
from 40 to 53 with GoG’s approval. The total number of districts increased from 110 to 138 in 2005

47

expense of deprived districts. The likely explanation rests with the increased access o f at-risk groups to
primary education. Standardized test results are being collected on learning achievement, but the data are
yet to be analyzed. These results should provide highly relevant information to district officers on school
performance and the key demand and supply factors that influence learning.

IDA’Sengagement in education has contributed to better management and planning capacities of
the central and local authorities. In addition to supporting progress towards MDG targets, EdSeP i s
piloting increased district level capacity in planning and management for a decentralized system o f
education administration. EdSeP has contributed to improving coverage, processing and dissemination of
statistical data through the decentralized Education Management Information System (EMIS).
Furthermore, EdSeP’s own project objectives and indicators are fully harmonized with government’s
sector strategy and with donor support to the sector.
In sum, while the CAS targets on gross enrollment and primary completion were partially met,
the student achievement targets were not met, with data showing a slight decline in the deprived regions.
The CAS target on girls’ primary completion was not met due to a recent decline from a peak in 2004.

E.
Reduce child mortality; improve maternal health. While Ghana has some of the best health
indicators in Africa, recent performance in child and maternal mortality has stagnated. There have
been notable improvements, however, in other related areas, i.e. severe malnutrition reduced from 7% in
2003 to 5% in 2006. The case fatality rate from malaria for children under 5 has declined from 4.4% in
2005 to 2.4% in 2006. Given the relatively high CAS target for immunization coverage, it i s unlikely that
this benchmark can be met without significant financial inputs, which may not be the best use o f scarce
public funds. Ghana continues to see persistent inequalities in health indicators between regions. The
three poorest regions reported improvements in most areas, but these were offset by deteriorations in
urban areas.
Access to quality obstetric care, as measured by theproportion of births attended by skilled
health personnel, has improved, once again with the best results in the deprived areas. Government’s
approach to reaching MDGs 4 and 5 i s to scale up key interventions that have demonstrated the greatest
impact on mortality rates. In Ghana, this approach, referred to as High Impact Rapid Delivery (HIRD), i s
supported by most donors. The Bank will provide direct support to this program in a proposed Child
Survival project (June 2007) that will emphasize malaria and nutrition, both o f which are Bank priorities.
Evidence from other African countries and the Upper East region in Ghana indicates that these
interventions can have a significant impact on maternal and child health outcomes.
Overall, the Bank has made a good contribution to Ghana’s health achievements. The PRSC has made a
significant impact in terms of improving the performance in execution of the health budget. The PRSC
has also supported the program o f exemptions for the poor and, in particular, helped to introduce an
exemption o f deliveries for all pregnant women. More recently, within the PRSC, financial access o f
health services for the poor i s being addressed through support to the new health insurance system. The
Bank intends to intensify the dialogue in health insurance with a new Health Insurance project proposed
for FY07. Future financial support to the sector will be primarily through the PRSC, rather than through
sector-wide operations. T w o investment projects are proposed for F Y 0 7 in health insurance ($15 million)
and child survival ($25 million). The Bank will also continue to provide policy advice o n human
resources and decentralization o f the sector. These are areas where the Bank has a comparative advantage
and where the government has requested Bank assistance.

Pillar 3: Governance for empowerment
A.
Build a democratic and inclusive state. Ghana boasts a mature democratic society and i s
looked upon by many African nations as a model for a participatory and open society. Ghana was the
first country to undergo the African Peer Review Mechanism and was rated favorably by peers in the
governance and inclusiveness areas. Ghana has significantly strengthened governance, public financial
management, and procurement systems over the past several years, with strong support from the Bank
andpartners. IDA has also contributed to an environment o f accountability by advancing public
dialogue and debate, increasing transparency, and pushing decentralization. Budget execution has
improved, with timely external audits, parliamentary oversight and civil society involvement in
monitoring government policies and service delivery. Expenditure information i s made public on the
Internet.
IDA’S main lending instrument under Pillar 3 was the PRSC series, with their cross-cutting
focus on public expenditure management, governance, public sector reform and decentralization. In
addition, the Economic Management and Capacity Building (EMCB) project aimed to advance financial
sector reforms, improve the efficiency o f public sector management and enhance the quality o f service
delivery.
Beginning in 2003, the Bank has facilitated a series of Development Dialogues, which have
created the plaalformfor public discourse on critical developmentpolicy issues. These have focused
largely o n decentralization, strategies to involve the poor in decision-making, combating corruption, and
forging new partnerships between government, donors and civil society.
Civil society increasingly monitors government policies and delivery, especially at the local
government level where Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) are involved in the tracking o f HIPC,
National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) and District Assembly Common Fund (DACF) allocations and
expenditures. The Bank has provided training to CSOs through WBI. In addition, the Bank’s Small
Grants Program provided grants to encourage CSOs to undertake independent work and assessment of
government programs. Many public and private watchdog agencies have undertaken anti-corruption
initiatives, and during the CAS period, some o f the state institutions charged with anti-cormption
mandates received various kinds o f support. CSOs in governance and anticorruption embarked o n
research, round table discussions, public forums and debate to sensitize the public on anti-corruption
issues, and also monitored corruption practices in the 2004 polls. There has also been public education in
the local and district levels on the need to hold government accountable. A Participatory Monitoring and
Evaluation was conducted in six districts on the provision o f basic services: water, sanitation facilities,
access to health services, primary education and views on impact o f macroeconomic reforms on
household livelihoods. Most o f these activities have been motivated or supported by the Bank-sponsored
Development Dialogue series.
Parliamentary oversight has improved over the CASperiod. Members o f the Parliamentary
Accounts Committee (PAC), which now submits i t s report to the House within six months o f submission
o f the reports by the Auditor-General, benefited from extensive discussions with Bank PEFA and PER
teams. The Bank has also assisted with training the PSRP Committee in Parliament. Overall, Parliament
received assistance for capacity building from several institutions, including from WBI.

Government, IDA and other donors have prepared to launch the Public Expenditure Tracking
Survey (PETS) to allow deeper analysis o f links between public spending and service delivery at the
facility level, and to improve the effectiveness and accountability in the use o f public funds. Specifically,
the PETS will focus on identifying the causes o f inefficiencies in public spending and execution in health
and education.

50

B.
Improve public sector management for service delivery. The government made signifcant
progress in strengthening PFM by enacting the Financial Administration, Internal Audit Agency, and
Public Procurement Acts, which upgraded the regulatory framework for public expenditure management.
G o G also took measures to improve the scope, timing and quality o f reporting o n budget execution.
Through the PRSCs and the Bank’s joint analytical work on PFM, the Bank has supported the momentum
within government to move forward on PFM. Key fiduciary assessments - annual External Reviews o f
Public Financial Management, the Country Financial Accountability Assessment, and the Country
Procurement Assessment Review -provided analytical underpinnings for support to strengthen these
areas. Since 2004, Government has taken concrete actions to improve the transparency and accountability
o f the executive. These improvements have comefrom enhanced budget coverage and budget
execution, and timelyfscal reporting and external auditing of public accounts. Budget coverage has
been broadened to include more information on internally-generated funds and donor grants. Budget
execution has been improved with cash and commitment controls yielding: (i)
greater alignment between
the expenditure outturns o f the largest spending ministries and the voted budget, and the country’s poverty
more timely reconciliation between accounting transactions and banking
reduction strategy; and (ii)
records. Ghana’s fiscal reporting continues to improve in timing and quality, as discussed in Table 3.
Progress in P F M was confirmed during the baseline assessment o f Ghana’s PFM - using the Public
Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Performance Measurement Framework, which was
finalized as part o f the 2006 ERPFM.
The PRSC has helped Ghana’s progress in implementing the provisions of the Public
Procurement Act, and steps under PRSCS of May 2007 should contribute tofurther enhancing the
quality of public spending. Activities supported are: the establishment o f the Public Procurement Board
(PPB) and i t s Secretariat; the collection o f information on upcoming tenders and contract awards; the
preparation o f procurement plans for key MDAs; the publication o f information on public procurement on
the website o f the PPB, including samples o f standard tender documents; and information on tendering
opportunities and contracts awarded. The PPB i s currently workmg on the publication o f PPB bulletins.
A web-based procurement planning tool has been developed and i s expected to be tested by June 2007. A
new computerized Integrated Personnel and Payroll Database (JPPD-2) has been established and i s
operational. This new system allows for MDAs to make changes to personnel and payroll records online.
MDAs are using the new system to progressively improve the accuracy o f the pay records.

5

Progress was slower than expected on the CAS objective of decentralizing responsibilitiesfor
service provision, although there are no benchmarks to evaluate performance. GoG i s preparing a new
decentralization policy, and development partners are uniting around a joint support strategy, which i s
likely to take the form o f a sector development policy operation in the next C A S period. A committee
was set up to define a new path for fiscal decentralization, including developing an intergovernmental
fiscal framework. The C B R D project supported work o n integrated development planning, which was
enhanced by the development o f a District Development Planning Guideline. CBRD also supported the
Controller and Accountant General Department (CAGD) to prepare accounting manuals for District
Assemblies. The Bank and partners assisted GOG to develop a performance-based District Development
Funding facility and an assessment tool. This work done during the CASperiod willprovide the basis
for future I D A support to decentralization.

IV.

BANK PERFORMANCE

Lending. The Bank carried out its strategy and plannedprogram during the CASperiod,
achieved many good results together with government and other partners, and took corrective action to
address problems and refocus efforts as needed. The main thrust o f the Bank’s support -to underpin the
government’s drive for accelerated growth and poverty reduction, with coordinated budget support,
selected investments, and focused analytics and policy advice -was maintained successfully during the
C A S period. The program included an expansion into regional initiatives, including five regional projects
(HIV/AIDS Treatment Acceleration Program, West Africa Gas Pipeline (WAGP), West Africa Power
Pool (WAPP), West Africa Agriculture Productivity Program, and West Africa Transit). Total actual
lending in FY04-07 o f $1,183.9 million exceeded planned base-case lending o f $1,055 million, in line
with Ghana’s improved performance on the CPIA. Attachment 2 presents the planned and actual
programs. l5
It i s worth noting that, in response to the government’s renewed emphasis on growth in GPRSII
(2006-2009), the Bank chose to support the development o f the I C T sector with an investment operation

15
Actual lending includes the following projects that are pending Board approval on June 21: Energy ($95.5m
including GEF o f $5.5m); Urban Transport ($52m including GEF o f $7m); Health Insurance ($15m); Child Survival
($25m); and the Small Towns Water Supplement ($lorn). I t also includes the GEDAP Catalytic Fund amount o f
US$50m, which has been approved by the Bank and i s awaiting release o f second tranche o f funding from the UK,
expected in May, 2007.

in FY07. In addition, to help the government better address the underlying factors behind stagnating
child and maternal mortality indicators, the Bank i s preparing a Child Survival project for presentation to
the Board at the time o f this Report. This project supports Ghana’s approach o f scaling up interventions
shown to have the greatest impact through the High Impact Rapid Delivery (HIRD) program. The project
will complement the proposed Health Insurance project, planned for Board presentation at the same time.
Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA). The Bank’s program o f AAA has been instrumental
in informing policies relating to governance and PFM, the financial sector, energy, telecommunications

and health insurance (Attachment 3). The annual External Review o f Public Financial Management
(ERPFM) studies in 2004,2005 and 2006, and the C F A A (FY04) and CPAR (FY04) supported key
government actions to improve public financial management, as discussed under Pillar 3 above. The
2006 ERPFM will establish the baseline assessment o f Ghana’s P F M using the PEFA Performance
Measurement Framework for monitoring progress in the context o f GPRSII. The Energy Policy AAA
guided petroleum pricing, and the upcoming GEDAP i s informed by findings from ongoing AAA on
energy policy in the urban and rural sectors. The study on National Health Insurance Implementation
contributed to the introduction o f the national health insurance scheme. A flagship report on natural
resource management has contributed significantly to the debate around the growth and management o f
Ghana’s natural resource base, and will underpin forthcoming multi-donor support o f environmental
governance efforts. Analytical work in telecommunications contributed to important changes in the
regulatory environment in this sector and has informed the ongoing e-Ghana project.
In 2006, the Bank’s Quality Assurance Group (QAG) assessed the AAA program in Ghana, and
identified a key gap in the program: the limited understanding o f the real sectors and the drivers o f
a thorough analysis o f
growth. In connection with this assessment, QAG recommended: (i)
developments in key sub-sectors such as agriculture and manufacturing, through background papers and
analysis o f the incidence and efficiency o f public expenditure, as previous work
focused surveys; and (ii)
has focused on expenditure systems and on including public expenditures within the budget system.

Beginning in early 2006, the Bank initiated a comprehensive analysis o f the sources and
constraints to growth in the Ghanaian economy. The effort was kicked o f f in January 2006 with a twoday session with Cabinet to explore the opportunities for accelerating growth through energy policy,
better infrastructure, a developed I C T sector, enhanced agricultural productivity and an improved
business climate. Follow-up workshops took place in M a y o f that year, and included consultations on the
Youth Employment study and the Country Environmental Assessment. The results o f this dialogue have
fed into the preparation o f a Country Economic Memorandum, which has involved strong participation o f
the Ministry o f Finance and Economic Planning, the National Development Planning Commission,
Ghanaian research institutions, and other partners. Initial findings will be presented at the upcoming C G
meeting in June 2007 and will inform the forthcoming CAS. The Bank has also begun work on a Poverty
Assessment, using the recent data from the Ghana Living Standards and Measurement Survey.
Portfolio Performance. Attachment 4 provides a summary o f portfolio indicators. The
portfolio as o f April 18,2007 consisted o f 17 operations totaling $928 million in net commitments, of
which $453.9 million remains undisbursed. Overall, portfolio performance improved over the CAS
period, with the percentage ofproblem projects by number droppingfrom 20% in FY04 to 12.5% in
FY07. The percentage o f projects at risk by number also fell from 26.7% to 12.5% over the period. In
addition, disbursements have increased over the last several years, both in terms o f absolute numbers and
in terms o f the disbursement ratio. Disbursements rose from $144 million in F Y 0 4 to $443 million in
F Y 0 6 (last year for complete financial data), and the ratio increased from 25.2% to 30% over the same
period.

Despite these improvements in the portfolio, challenges remain, especially in M&E and
procurement - two areas task team leaders flag as being inadequate during implementation. At present,
there are two ‘marginally unsatisfactory’ (MU) projects: the Education Sector project, rated “MU” for
Implementation Progress; and Urban Environmental Sanitation, rated MU in achieving i t s Development
Objectives, The Education project i s implemented by several institutions instead o f one implementing
agency, capacities at central and local levels are inadequate, and attention to the project i s limited given
the multi-faceted reforms. Many o f the activities and components are linked to the decentralization o f
public services and public administration-the latter has been stalled for the last year. In the Urban
Environmental Sanitation project, all development objectives are related to the impact o f physical works,
which have been delayed in getting started.
With regard to projects that exited the portfolio during the CASperiod, there was a net
disconnect of 33% in FY04 and 50% in FY06 (defined in Attachment 4). The final Implementation
Public Enterprise and Privatization TA Project (PEPTA) and
Status Reports o f two closures in FYO4-the
the Public Financial Management Project-rated the projects ‘satisfactory’ for achieving the respective
development objectives, while the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) and project’s Implementation
Completion Reports (ICRs) rated project outcomes (for achieving the development objectives) and Bank
performance as ‘unsatisfactory’. In FY06, the A I D S Response project presented a disconnect between the
satisfactory rating in the final ISR and the unsatisfactory rating from IEG.
Portfolio Management. According to IEG assessments, Ghana’s performance in terms o f
exiting projects meeting their development objectives and prospects for sustainability deteriorated during
the 2000-2005 period, compared to the 1990s.l6 In order to find better ways to do business and address
those issues that were impeding portfolio performance, in September 2005, GoG and the Bank reviewed
the portfolio in a Country Portfolio Review (CPR). The CPR Action Plan and conclusions fed into the
development o f a Ghana Joint Assistance Strategy (G-JAS), which aligned donor support to GPRS 11.
During this CAS period, the Bank has worked with the government to improve portfolio
performance. The Ministry o f Finance and Economic Planning (MOFEP) maintains a team o f desk
officers for the Bank-supported portfolio, who participate actively in the preparation, negotiations and
implementation support process for all operations. As a medium-term strategy for improving
development results, the joint GoG-Bank teams have focused on improving quality at entry, with a
particular emphasis on implementation readiness, M&E arrangements, safeguards compliance, clearer
formulation o f development objectives and outcomes, and greater realism regarding risk assessment. For
projects under implementation, joint project level reviews are held semi-annually, involving development
partners active in the sector as well.

Aid Coordination. Aid Effectiveness and Harmonization improved during the CASperiod, as
the Bank worked closely with development partners to introduce and strengthen a number o f coordination
instruments. Aid coordination mechanisms o f importance include the multi-donor budget support group
(MDBS), in which IDA participates through the PRSC series, transformation o f the C G Meeting, and
formation o f a robust local harmonization fkamework, including signature o f a Joint Assistance Strategy.
The M D B S mechanism was created following the 2003 C G meeting, bringing together 11
partners and about $300 million in annual disbursements under one umbrella. T h i s multi-donor
mechanism has become an important forum for policy dialogue o n strategic reforms, captured in a
harmonized performance assessment framework. The Bank has provided four PRSCs (totaling $500
million) over FY04-FY07. During 2006, agreement was reached on h o w to increase predictability o f the
M D B S mechanism with respect to Ghana’s budget cycle.

Following the 2003 C G meeting, G o G and development partners decided to move away from
pledging events every two to three years, to annual partnership meetings to provide a framework for
discussions related to performance and scaling up. The first such “Results, Resources and Partnership”
C G meeting was held in November 2005. The timing o f these annual meetings was shifted to June in
2006, to enhance aid predictability and policy dialogue prior to preparation o f the government budget
(presented to Parliament each November).
A local Harmonization Memorandum o f Understanding, signed by G o G and partners in February
2005, facilitated in addressing the five Paris Declaration principles o f ownership, alignment,
harmonization, managing for results and mutual accountability during the CAS period. In November
2005, a joint GoG-DP working group developed a Ghana Harmonization and Aid Effectiveness Action
Plan (G-HAP), which laid out specific actions for achieving Paris Declaration targets. The G-HAP
covered 18 months (Jan 2006-June 2007) and was endorsed at the November 2005 C G meeting. The next
G-HAP will be presented at the June 2007 CG, with a progress report o n implementation during 2006.
The Ghana G-JAS, signed in March 2007, was among the harmonization milestones achieved during
2006.”
Client Feedback. The Client Survey was undertaken in June-September 2006, when a broad
array o f stakeholders o f the World Bank in Ghana was invited to provide opinions on the Bank’s
assistance. There i s overwhelming support for Bank involvement in Ghana with 57% o f respondents
saying the Bank should be more involved. Stakeholders consider growth to be the top development
priority for Ghana, followed by education and governance, and envision an important role for the Bank in
these areas. They also appreciate the role o f the World Bank in agriculture. The Bank i s seen to be a
provider o f both finances and knowledge. Survey findings related to media show that respondents receive
most o f their information on development issues from local media (57%), the World Bank Ghana office
(39%) and from the internet.

LESSONS GOING FORWARD

The CAS was well aligned with government’s strategy and focused on the areas that the
GPRS identified as constraints to attaining longer term development outcomes. The CAS’S mix o f
interventions was appropriate in supporting the objectives under i t s three pillars. Overall, IDA has made
an important contribution to financing Ghana’s progress towards GPRS goals. Growth has accelerated
and Ghana i s poised to achieve the poverty MDG in the near term. IDA will continue t o support Ghana
under the next CAS through general budget support (a second series o f PRSCs), and financial and
analytical support under the three GPRS I1pillars.

Government and stakeholder ownership are critical to success of policy reforms and
projects, and to relevance o f analytical work. A vibrant public policy debate, ease o f access to
information, and active media has underpinned this deepening o f public policy choice. Government
ownership o f PFM reforms and commitment to macroeconomic stability has driven Ghana’s progress.
The Bank’s support to PFM reforms, both in the form o f budget support operations (PRSC 1-5) and
analytical contributions to the ERPFM, has complemented what the government already set out to do, and
has thereby helped to add momentum to existing government initiatives. T h e results o f the last f i v e
years, in terms o f macroeconomic stability and reforms, testifies to the effectiveness o f this
approach in Ghana, especially as compared with the earlier structural adjustment model that witnessed

uneven policy performance with frequent backsliding. Where ownership o f previous programs was weak,
such as in public sector reform, urban policy and natural resource management, discontinuity o f support
was essential to reestablish a platform for renewed cooperation. Public sector reform, pursued relatively
unsuccessfully over a long period, was also discontinued during the CAS period, due to poor ownership
o f existing projects, such as the Public Sector Management Project. Only after several years o f
preparation and dialogue within government, was a strategy presented, which provided a basis for
renewed support.
e
A well-defined results framework i s needed to monitor Bank contributions to country
achievements. The CAS was written to support the country’s first poverty reduction strategy. While the
primary results objectives were economic growth and poverty reduction, with clear and continuous
measurements, not every sector had a clearly defined PRSP results chain that could anchor a Banksupported results framework. The CAS, which was designed at the beginning o f the evolution o f resultsbased CASs at the Bank, adopted a results matrix that included country-level development outcomes,
outcomes affected by government policy actions, as well as outputs produced by Bank projects,
representing different stages o f the results chain. In addition, while most o f the indicators related to areas
o f Bank support, some indicators were only indirectly related to Bank interventions. In contrast, the
FY08-11CAS will build on the joint government/partner results matrix, derived from GPRS 11, which
maps both government and partner actions to outcomes with baselines and targets. The G-JAS applies to
this results matrix. The FY08-11CAS will therefore only include a simple results framework that aligns
Bank support to government’s objectives and includes several key indicators that can be influenced by the
Bank program. In addition, indicators will be chosen with an eye to data availability, frequency o f
reporting, and relevance to existing government sector strategies and monitoring frameworks.

The M D B S Framework has shown that coordination of general budget support and
cohesion around common policy priorities has considerable effect. M D B S has promoted a more
effective dialogue between government and donors, predictable financing for the budget, and reduced
transaction costs for government. Nevertheless, the transaction costs for donors can be high, and
challenges remain in terms o f agreeing on principles o f results measurement, and in terms o f effectively
capturing line ministries’ sector strategies in the budget support dialogue. Ongoing evaluation o f the
M D B S and the I C R o f PRSCs 1-3 will give further critical guidance.
e

Donor coordination at the sectoral level, especially when facilitated b y a Sector-Wide
Approach to funding, has progressed in Ghana, both in terms o f aligning with the government’s sector
policies and o f increasing aid effectiveness. The Second Health SWAP i s an example o f this
coordination. Several other sectors such as water, and private and public sector development have
evolved similar approaches. Based on this positive experience, the
G-JAS and the Bank’s CAS foresee an increased use o f these sector budget support operations over the
next four years. A critical lesson in this regard i s that where sector groups are weak, with non-effective
co-leadership, on either the government or partner side, or where the link between the sector group and
the overall development framework, including MDBS, i s weak, transaction costs increase and aid
effectiveness suffers.
Sector operations need to incorporate cross-cutting and multi-sectoral strategies and
interventions. While the sector support to health has been successful o n many fronts, health outcomes
are s t i l l perceived to be mixed. Other related issues, such as water, sanitation, nutrition, decentralization
and capacity building, have high impact. While this i s not a new insight, it i s likely that health outcomes
during the C A S period could have improved with stronger cross-sectoral approaches.
e

T h e conditions for analytical work to succeed need better scrutiny. The CEM, presented
ahead o f the CAS, failed to have much impact, yet the basic strategic thrust o f government policy and
partner support allowed the M D B S to strongly contribute to growth outcomes. In the case o f ICT, several
years o f AAA, working closely with relevant authorities, preceded and prepared for the country’s
transformative ICT expansion. Innatural resource management, a foreseen APL was discontinued in the
face o f weak ownership in favor o f two large pieces o f ESW, both o f which prepared the ground for
greater awareness, strong ownership and a new multi-donor SWAP under the next CAS. The multi-donor
approach to the core P F M analytics was a prerequisite for the role played by M D B S .

Regional projects need to be closely aligned with sectoral interventions at country level.
Considerable effort was spent during the CAS period in aligning regional approaches with the country’s
strategies and projects. In the case o f energy, a multitude of interventions, AAA, MDBS, a redirected old
project (Ghana Thermal), the West Afnca Gas Pipeline, the West Africa Power Pool l a n d 2, and by F C
and MIGA, needed an overall coordination that was late in coming. Grounding all such interventions
coherently in a rapidly transforming policy environment, with multiple centers o f government authority,
was a challenge.

Achieving integrated World Bank Group engagement required considerable effort. While
FC’s and MIGA’s engagement grew considerably during the CAS period, more can be done to develop
synergies. The WAGP became a good example o f combining an IDA Partial Risk Guarantee and
MIGA’s coverage, but was highly demanding in preparation. The M S M E project, which i s a good
example o f I D N I F C cooperation, took considerable effort and time to prepare, aiming to achieve
demanding new approaches.

Decentralization of Bank staff facilitates a better understanding of the client’s needs, more
effective dialogue with partners, and early action on potential portfolio problems. Without
exception, this i s a clear lesson. Only in the latter part o f the CAS period was previous empowerment o f
the county office followed up by decentralizing more of sector teams. The competent staff working as a
multi-sectoral team in Accra helped to maintain a good dialogue with senior officials and focus early on
potential problems

Annex 12: Debt Sustainability Assessment @SA)

Ghana-Joint IMF and World Bank External Debt Sustainability Analysislg
Summary

1.
The result o f the debt sustainability analysis indicates that Ghana’s risk of debt distress i s
moderate,20’21’zz
albeit close to the low risk category, In the medium to long term, Ghana’s projected
debt burden trajectory breaches just one o f the three commonly used indicative thresholds (the NPV o f
debt-to-GDP ratio), and returns to a downward path thereafter. Under this stress test, a sharp decline in
the GDP deflator and, consequently, a sharp rise in the import bill, combined with much lower net current
transfers, leads to a widening o f the current account deficit in 2007 and 2008, respectively. These current
account deficits are then projected to be financed primarily at nonconcessional terms. Thus, while one
cannot rule out an external shock o f such magnitude, the probability o f such a shock occurring i s very
low.
2.
The baseline scenario assumes the continuation o f trends in current economic reforms.
These reforms include: (i)
continued macroeconomic stabilization (prudent fiscal stance, single-digit
inflation), (ii)
perseverance with the pace o f structural reforms (public financial management (PFM), and
reforms o f state-owned enterprises (SOEs), including divestiture), and (iii)
prudent borrowing strategy
and efficient use o f borrowed funds. In the mean time, remittances are assumed to remain constant as a
share o f GDP (at 15 percent), while FDI inflows are expected to increase gradually. International reserves
would exceed 4 months o f imports at the end o f the projection period. The baseline scenario also
incorporates nonconcessional borrowing o f US$700 million over the next three years, plus continued
annual market access o f about 1 percent o f GDP for the rest o f the projection period. In making these
assumptions about nonconcessional borrowing, the analysis attempts to be realistic with regard to
commercial borrowing volumes and to illustrate the value o f prudence and the importance o f the judicious
use o f nonconcessional funds.

l9
Prepared by the

IMF and W o r l d Bank staff in collaboration with the Ghanaian authorities.

2o The relevant thresholds are (i)
50 percent debt to G D P ratio; (ii200
) percent NPV debt to export ratio; and (iii)
25
p;rcent debt service to export ratio.
The macroeconomic assumptions under the baseline scenario are as follows. On the real economy front, the real
G D P growth i s assumed to grow at an average o f 7 percent between 2007 and 2012, and then by 5.8 percent over the
remainder o f the projection period, representing a 1.7 percent increase over i t s ten year historical average. The
projected increase in real G D P i s contingent o n continuous macroeconomic stability, sustained growth o n exports
and projected increase in infrastructure investment (in part related t o the drive to reach the MDGs). On the external
sector front, the non-interest current account deficit i s assumed t o average 6 percent o f GDP, export, 24 percent o f
G D P and, imports, 32 percent of GDP, respectively.
22 Debt sustainability is assessed based o n ratios for debt stock and debt service t o measures o f repayment capacity
(GDP and exports). Debt stock indicators provide a useful measure o f the total future debt-service burden o f
existing debt. This burden i s best measured using the net present value (NPV) o f debt t o capture the concessionality
o f outstanding debt. Debt-service indicators provide a measure o f the immediate burden that debt imposes o n a
country by crowding out other uses o f scarce resources. Repayment capacity i s measured by GDP, exports o f goods
and services, o r government revenues. The most relevant measure o f repayment capacity depends o n the constraints
that are most binding in an individual country. The NFV debt ratios are summary indicators o f the burden
represented by the future obligations o f a country and thus reflect long-term risks t o solvency, while the time path o f
debt-service ratios provides an indication o f the likelihood and possible timing o f liquidity problems.

85

3.
The main endogenous factor” contributing to the debt sustainability outlook i s the strong
projected real GDP growth - contributing on average to a 1.7 percentage point decline in the stock
o f external debt to GDP ratio between now and the end of the projection period. The contribution
coming from higher GDP growth i s partially offset however by rising interest payments, reducing the net
effect o f the endogenous factors to 0.9 percent. In addition, net current transfers, namely remittances
inflows and official transfers, and foreign direct investment flows are expected to contribute on average
with 18 percentage points o f GDP, further adding to the decline in the external debt to GDP ratio during
this period. It i s important to note that these inflows (Le,, net transfers and net foreign investment) are
expected to increase from the historical average ofjust over 13 percent o f GDP during 1995-2005, to 18
percent o f GDP during 2007-201 1 period, triggered by the country’s stable macroeconomic environment.

Endogenous factors are derived from the budget constraint equation, which assesses sustainability in terms of the
growth in real GDP, and interest rate o n the stock of debt.
