FOREWARD
A category 5 hurricane, Felix, hit the North Atlantic Autonomous Region (RAAN) of Nicaragua
on September 4, 2007 causing numerous fatalities and widespread damage to infrastructure,
housing stock, agriculture, fisheries and the natural habitat. The RAAN is one of the poorest
parts of the country and hosts a majority population of various indigenous and ethnic
communities. In response to the Government's request, the Bank intends to reallocate
undisbursed IDA funds from an ongoing credit, the Enhanced Competitiveness Project II, to
finance an Emergency Recovery Credit.

i

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.
The FY03-05 CAS and the FY06-07 ISN were aligned around Nicaragua’s first Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) which was later revised and renamed the National
Development Plan in 2005. Although Nicaragua’s core objective to reduce extreme poverty was
not achieved to the extent desirable, achievements were made across the program with
considerable progress in promoting a stable macroeconomic environment, reducing the fiscal
deficit significantly, and lowering external debt to sustainable levels by achieving the HIPC
Completion Point and obtaining further debt reduction through the Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative (MDRI). Growth has been modest averaging around 3.2 percent per year since 2002,
and exports have doubled. Though the Bank was instrumental in the increase of poverty
spending from 9.6 percent of GDP in 2002 to 13.6 percent in 2006, greater expenditure has yet to
translate into significant gains in poverty reduction.
2.
Nicaragua remains the second poorest country in Latin America after Haiti. Although
economic gains have reduced the scale and severity of poverty in Nicaragua, it is still
unacceptably high with 46 percent of the population living below the poverty line. To achieve
the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the rate of progress will have to be stepped up.
The key development challenges are to accelerate growth over a sustained period and ensure that
its benefits are broadly shared. To achieve these objectives, Nicaragua will need to maintain a
sound macroeconomic and fiscal policy, improve poverty targeting and efficiency of public
expenditures, dramatically improve human capital formation, and expand economic
opportunities for the poor by creating an enabling environment for investments and job creation.
3.
The proposed Bank Group Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Nicaragua (FY08-12)
is aligned to the Government’s priorities and its evolving poverty reduction strategy, and is
structured around support for four strategic objectives: (i) reactivating the economy, stimulating
productivity and competitiveness; (ii) human capital development by improving social equity
and opportunity; (iii) infrastructure and sustainable development; and (iv) strengthening
governance and accountability by modernizing state institutions and promoting citizen
participation.
4.
Indicative International Development Association (IDA) allocations for the five year
period FY08-12 could amount to around US$ 240 million. In the proposed CPS, the Bank Group
has selectively chosen focal areas for engagement. The annual series of budgetary support
operations, the Poverty Reduction and Support Credits (PRSCs), together with an associated
technical assistance credit would allow the Bank to engage in the reform program of the
Government focused on governance and public sector modernization, the investment climate
(property rights and regulatory institutions), and improvements in social service provision. New
investment operations would be limited to urban and rural water and sanitation, public sector
management, land administration, and rural roads.
5.
The Bank’s ongoing portfolio of eleven operations, many of them relatively new, and
recent analytic work provide ample opportunities to stay engaged on key policy issues. In
energy, the Bank will work closely with the lead donor, the Inter-American Development Bank
(IADB), to ensure that our programmed Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA) contribute to
ii

improved sector performance. We will also continue to support the education sector through the
Education for All Fast Track Initiative’s (EFA-FTI) Expanded Catalytic Facility, and help the
Government develop a national strategy to combat chronic malnutrition through appropriate
advisory services.
6.
Complementing the Bank, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) aims to help
accelerate private sector development supporting projects both at the regional and country levels.
In Central America, IFC has been focusing on deepening regional integration, with priorities
including: i) strengthening and broadening the financial sector, including access to term
financing by micro, small, and medium size enterprises (MSMEs); ii) helping improve physical
infrastructure; iii) supporting competitive firms in agriculture, industry and services; and
iv) promoting south-south investments and helping local companies become regional and global
players. These priorities are reflected in IFC’s operations in Nicaragua with a focus on:
a) improving the investment climate by simplifying business regulations at the municipal level;
b) strengthening MSMEs’ competitiveness and improving their access to finance; c) assisting
exporters and hard currency earners, such as in agribusiness and tourism; and d) addressing
critical infrastructure needs such as transport and energy (including renewable energy).
7.
Nicaragua remains highly aid dependent with over 30 percent of its budget coming from
Official Development Assistance (ODA) in its recent past. With annual aid disbursements of
around US$550 million annually and with over forty donor countries and institutions involved,
aid harmonization and alignment are major challenges. The Bank Group will work with donor
partners under the Government’s leadership to ensure greater donor alignment to the new
administration’s priorities, and a more coordinated attempt at harmonization to improve overall
development impact.
8.
The main risks to the Bank Group’s FY08-12 Country Partnership Strategy arise from the
possibility that the new administration may be unable to generate broad consensus on the
politically challenging reform agenda or to resist measures that could threaten macro stability,
undermine investor confidence and jeopardize growth prospects. These challenges will be
addressed by maintaining a continuous and close dialogue with the authorities and coordinating
with key stakeholders, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Budget Support
Group (BSG), a roundtable of key donors. Weak institutional capacity could hinder reform and
program implementation. This will be partially mitigated and supported by capacity building
and strengthening fiduciary and sectoral oversight at the Country Office. Natural disasters pose
a significant risk during the CPS period, which will be partially mitigated by AAA to better
identify risk and its impacts (i.e., the FY08 Central American Probabilistic Risk Assessment) and
help with the design of a regional risk insurance mechanism. A final key risk stems from the
challenges of effective donor harmonization and alignment. The Bank will strengthen its
strategic role in enhancing the Government’s capacity to lead these processes and work closely
with our donor partners to follow up on the implementation of the national harmonization and
alignment plan. A mid-term CPS Progress Report is scheduled for early 2010, which will allow
the Bank to review and discuss necessary adjustments.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The last Country Assistance Strategy for Nicaragua (FY03-05) was discussed in
December 2002 and the Interim Strategy Note1 (FY06-07) was discussed in July 2005. A new
World Bank Group Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) has been developed for Nicaragua to
cover FY08 through FY12 with a mid-term CPS Progress Report scheduled for early 2010. The
proposed CPS is aligned to the Government’s priorities and the country’s poverty reduction
strategy (see paragraph below). It will provide a clear sense of the strategic options for
Nicaragua, the World Bank Group and other donor partners in support of a coordinated
partnership strategy to achieve the country’s development goals.
2.
Nicaragua’s long-term development vision and poverty reduction strategy are delineated
in its National Development Plan (NDP), 2005-2009, which gives greater importance to
economic growth than the strategy document that preceded it.2 The plan centers around five
strategic themes: (i) generating economic growth and employment for poverty reduction,
(ii) developing human capital and social protection, (iii) developing productive and social public
infrastructure, (iv) governance and state reform, and (v) macroeconomic stability. The primary
objective of the Ortega administration, which was recently elected in January 2007, is wealth
creation and poverty reduction through broadly shared economic growth. Additional key
principles of the Government include: a commitment to sound macroeconomic and fiscal policy,
as well as a healthy investment climate with private sector-led growth as a means to create
national wealth and achieve poverty reduction; better harmonization of aid and less dispersion of
projects; expanded economic relationships with new partners; the reactivation of rural
production; small and medium enterprise (SME) development to create jobs; and targeted social
programs, which are important elements of Nicaragua’s evolving poverty reduction strategy.
The Ortega administration is in the process of updating the NDP, renaming it the Plan for
Socioeconomic Development, and plans to hold consultations on it by the end of 2007. This
Plan would be presented for discussion along with a Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) at the
Boards of the Bank and the IMF in mid-2008.
3.
The above mentioned priority areas and key principles are strongly aligned with the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), some of which appear to be on track to reach the
targets for 2015. Those on track include poverty reduction, infant and child mortality, and access
to sanitation. However, major challenges remain in reaching the MDG targets in literacy, net
primary enrollment, chronic malnutrition, and access to water. The targets for maternal mortality
and access to reproductive health services also seem very unlikely to be met (see Table 1 on page
3 for further details).

II. COUNTRY CONTEXT AND DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES
4.
The people of Nicaragua lived through great upheavals during the last three
decades. During the 1950s and 1960s, Nicaragua boasted one of the region’s fastest growing
economies, albeit during a repressive military dictatorship. But subsequent years of economic
mismanagement, corruption, political strife, natural disasters and civil war, which took the lives
1

An ISN was prepared in July 2005 to enable the new CPS to be fully aligned with the political cycle in which a new government
administration was voted in to office in January 2007.
The first PRSP, called the Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (ERCERP), was prepared by the Aleman administration in 1997,
and was subsequently revised and updated by the Bolaños administration to become the National Development Plan covering 2005-2009.
2

1

of over 50,000, transformed the nation of about five million from a star performer into the
slowest growing country in the region. By the early 1990s, Nicaragua had become one of the
most highly indebted and economically unstable countries in the world. Half of the population
was living in poverty and one-fifth in extreme poverty.
5.
Nicaragua made rapid strides towards becoming a market-based economy during
the first half of the 1990s. It lowered trade barriers, reduced the size of its public sector and
began modernizing government. More public spending was aimed at the poor. The education
and health sectors were reformed and extreme poverty declined quickly. However, after the
devastation of Hurricane Mitch in October 1998, the government was overwhelmed by shortterm emergency needs and lost its focus on long-term development. As the huge flows of
emergency aid money slowed, the government failed to reduce its spending, and budget deficits
spiraled out of control. Nicaragua abandoned its program with the IMF, and by 2002 economic
growth had fallen to less than one percent. Hurricane Mitch, in effect, flattened the gains of
Nicaragua’s return to a market-based economy.
6.
The administration of President Bolaños, upon taking office in 2002, focused on
establishing fiscal discipline and attacking corruption. Its efforts paid off when Nicaragua
became the tenth country in the world to comply with conditions for debt relief under the Highly
Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Initiative (to date, only 20 countries worldwide have met the
HIPC completion point milestone). Over US$3 billion of public debt were forgiven in early
2004. Investors returned, and economic growth jumped to 5.1 percent in 2004, and has since
remained at around four percent.
7.
There have been noteworthy improvements in Nicaragua’s macroeconomic
performance since 2001. The economy has continued to grow moderately at an annual rate of
3.2 percent, complemented by a low 7.6 percent annual inflation rate and high levels of
international reserves. Exports doubled to about $2 billion, including maquila value added, and
the public debt is expected to fall from 200 percent of GDP to 55 percent by end-2007.
Moreover, important fiscal consolidation efforts helped reduce Nicaragua’s deficit from 6.6
percent of GDP in 2001 to a modest surplus in 2006. The financial sector was also stabilized
after the 2000 – 2001 crises.
8.
The Ortega administration is interested in maintaining policy continuity on key issues and
tackling pending development challenges, with a special focus on social issues that impact the
poorest. The administration is particularly interested in efforts to improve the country’s growth
performance while reducing poverty through shared economic growth.
Status on Achieving the MDGs
9.
Based on forecasts from current data, many MDG targets for 2015 are unlikely to be
achieved. The sole target projected as likely to be achieved is access to sanitation. It is possible
that targets will be met in reducing extreme poverty, infant mortality, and under-five mortality. It
is unlikely that targets will be met in reducing chronic malnutrition, increasing access to safe
water, reducing illiteracy, and achieving universal net primary enrollment. Targets considered
very unlikely to be met include reducing maternal mortality and improving access to
reproductive health services (see table on the following page). Although reaching each target is
important by itself, targets should be viewed collectively as they are mutually reinforcing. Better
access to clean water improves health; better health care increases school enrollment and reduces
2

poverty; and better education leads to better health. Increased incomes give people more
resources to pursue better education and health care and work for a cleaner environment.
Nicaragua clearly has a long way to go to achieve the 2015 MDG goals, and will require strong
public support, a concerted effort by all state actors, a good governance environment, and
considerable donor resources to accelerate progress.

Growth Dynamics
10.
Nicaragua’s annual GDP growth over the last five years has been modest and highly
variable. GDP growth averaged around 3.2 percent per annum from 2002 to 2006, or 1.3
percent in per capita terms. Though reasonable by LAC standards, growth is below the average
achieved by other medium-low income countries worldwide. Nicaragua’s growth was also
marked by strong fluctuations, continuing a pattern observed over the previous decade (Figure 1
on the following page) and generally reflecting the economy’s vulnerability to external economic
shocks (e.g., commodity price declines and oil price increases), natural disasters (e.g., El Niño,
hurricanes, and earthquakes) and domestic policy reversals (such as pre-election spending). The
modest level and erratic nature of growth have hampered progress in poverty reduction.
11.
Nicaragua’s growth performance was analyzed in the 2004 Nicaragua Development
Policy Review, which concluded that its difficulties in achieving fast, sustained growth were
attributable partly to insufficient rates of capital accumulation, but more importantly to
insufficient productivity growth. It also noted that Nicaragua exhibited particular shortcomings
in several key determinants of growth, namely in education attainment, public infrastructure,
financial sector development and governance, exacerbated by notably unstable macroeconomic
management over previous decades. Looking ahead, there are several good reasons to hope that
Nicaragua’s future growth may become more stable. First, in contrast to previous electoral
transitions, the stable macroeconomic legacy left by the outgoing Bolaños administration
obviates the need for a costly adjustment and breaks the tradition of policy-induced spending
cycles that characterized previous electoral periods, removing one of the most important sources
of macroeconomic instability. Furthermore, the risk of banking crises has declined significantly
3

with the consolidation of the banking system in the early part of this decade and the
implementation of reforms to strengthen the financial system. Exports are also likely to grow
from implementation of the Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement (DRCAFTA) and negotiations of new trade deals with the European Union (EU), Brazil, Canada, the
Caribbean Community (CARICOM), and the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas (ALBA).
Education attainment has also risen, though its impact on growth is likely to be felt only in the
long run, and the development of public infrastructure exhibits a mixed record, with significant
progress made in roads, but less momentum in the water and energy sectors.

12.
Poverty in Nicaragua declined slightly between 1993 and 2005. Overall poverty fell
between 1993 and 2001, but the 46 percent poverty rate in 2005 is nearly the same as the rate in
2001. In rural areas, poverty dropped substantially from 76 percent in 1993 to 69 percent in
1998 and has not gone down since then. Despite the slow progress in overall poverty reduction,
extreme poverty dropped significantly from 19 percent in 1993 to 17 percent in 1998 and to 15
percent in 2005. Due to substantial changes in extreme poverty, Nicaragua’s poverty gap has
narrowed, particularly the extreme poverty gap (Figure 2 on the following page).3 Inequality, as
measured by the Gini coefficient4 also declined from 0.49 in 1993 to 0.40 in 2005, suggesting
that the consumption gap between the rich and poor is narrowing, although much still remains to
be done to improve the living standards of the poorest segments of society.
13.
Although the consumption gap remains substantial, various measurements of basic needs
have improved according to census data and household data from the Living Standards
Measurement Surveys (LSMS). Reductions in four basic, negatively framed needs indicators
based on census and household survey data between 1995 and 2005 are shown in Figure 3 on the
following page. The basic needs index components include crowding (more than 3 people per
room), inadequate access to water and sanitation (potable tube or well water), inadequate
housing materials (unsafe materials used in the construction of walls, floors and ceilings), and
lack of school attendance (children of school age not attending school). The government has

defined levels of inadequacy for each of these indicators to indicate when these basic needs are
unsatisfied. All four indicators show consistent reductions (i.e., overall improvement) from 1995
to 2005.

Household survey data from 1998 and 2005 show that crowding dropped from 50 percent
to 33 percent, inadequate access to water and sanitation from 26 to 23 percent, inadequate
housing from 21 to 12 percent, and children out of school from 13 to 9 percent. Some of this
progress reflects better public services, such as in the water and education sectors, but even here
access hinges partially on private contributions, and thus income, to cover costs. Housing
quality clearly reflects higher income and consumption. It is difficult to believe that significant
improvements in housing quality could have occurred without a significant increase in
disposable income used to improve the quality and size of dwellings (including better roofs,
digging wells for water, and improved flooring).

15.
Nevertheless, Nicaragua can expect to advance in poverty reduction only with
significantly faster economic growth. From 1993 to 2005, Nicaragua exhibited a povertygrowth elasticity of -0.4 for total poverty and of -1.1 for extreme poverty. Based on these
5

elasticities, Nicaragua’s annual GDP growth would have to average 5.5 percent from now until
2015 to reduce extreme poverty to the 9.7 percent MDG target, from 14.9 percent in 2005.
Development Impact of Remittances
16.
Flows of workers remittances are very important in the Nicaraguan context. In
2005 Nicaragua received remittances amounting to US$650 million (about 13 percent of GDP)
reaching approximately 15 percent of Nicaragua’s households. According to The Development
Impact of Worker’ Remittances in Latin America (WB Report No. 37026), remittances are
contributing to significant improvements in both education and health indicators. For example,
school enrollment for 12-17 year-olds in households that receive remittances is about 15 percent
higher than in households without remittances. According to standardized measures of health
outcomes of weight and height by age, children in households that receive remittances have
better health outcomes than children in households that do not receive this form of income.
Similarly, children in households that receive remittances have better nutritional indicators.
17.
Remittances should be seen as an opportunity that complements a good
development strategy rather than a substitute. Despite the positive effect of remittances on a
wide range of development indicators, the evidence indicates that these flows are accompanied
by a number of policy challenges. For example, remittances appear to reduce the labor supply
and can lead to real exchange rate appreciation. Thus, in countries experiencing large remittance
inflows like Nicaragua, there may be a need for interventions aimed at achieving external
competitiveness gains. Similarly, the positive impact of remittances on development appears to
be related to the use of financial services by recipient households, which is much more limited in
Latin America than in the rest of the world. Potential reasons for that are: (i) lack of trust in the
financial sector; (ii) high banking costs; and (iii) limited access to physical branches. Thus,
additional efforts to deepen and improve access to the financial sector, both areas where public
intervention can make a difference, would likely contribute to enhance the development impact
of remittances.
Public Spending and Efficiency
18.
Poverty spending increased from 9.1 percent of GDP in 2002 to 13.6 percent of GDP in
2006; however, this has yet to translate into significant gains in poverty reduction. Social
spending does not adequately target the poor (e.g., 47 percent of poverty reduction
spending goes to the non-poor). Health and education spending has the largest redistributive
impact, but efficiency of expenditures in these sectors is low.
19.
The 2007 Public Expenditure Review (PER) analyses key public sector issues in
Nicaragua, with the aim of recommending policy options that can improve the effectiveness and
transparency of public resource allocation in ways that promote economic growth and poverty
reduction (see Box 1 on the following page).

6

Box 1: Nicaragua Public Expenditure Review (PER), 2007
Nicaragua has made impressive progress since 2001 in reducing its overall fiscal deficit. At the same time, external debt declined
substantially, reflecting the debt relief provided under various initiatives. These results put Nicaragua in a good position to
implement its poverty reduction strategy in a sustained manner. Further, an analysis of fiscal sustainability revealed that if
Nicaragua can generate a 4 percent annual growth rate and maintain the prudent macroeconomic policies of recent years (with a
primary surplus between 1% and 2% of GDP), then its current debt burden appears sustainable. However, several important
vulnerabilities, if not properly addressed, could undermine fiscal discipline. These include: (i) the growth in current transfers
(reflecting increased fiscal transfers to the municipalities mandated by Law 466); (ii) the growth in public wages, which is
sustainable only with rapid productivity growth; (iii) the actuarial deficit of the pension system; and (iv) an energy crisis, which
threatens to develop into a major obstacle for economic growth. To address theses threats, it will be necessary to: (i) develop a
political consensus on a decentralization strategy that results in more explicit linkage between central government
transfers and expenditure responsibilities of municipalities; (ii) develop and adopt appropriate framework legislation for
a public sector remuneration policy; (iii) introduce pension reforms to reduce the actuarial deficit to a fiscally sustainable
level; and (iv) encourage more investment in the energy sector by creating a more stable policy environment for private
investors.
Looking beyond macroeconomic stability, Nicaragua also needs to accelerate the pace of economic growth to generate greater
momentum in poverty reduction. The total amount of public infrastructure spending and social spending appears to be adequate
given Nicaragua’s economic capacity, but there is much room to improve the quality and efficiency of public spending. The PER
identified various options to improve the intra-sector allocation of resources and the quality of public expenditures in key areas
relevant to economic growth. It also pointed out the most important measures needed to modernize public expenditure
management and thereby facilitate adjustments to improve the quality of public spending in a cost-effective manner.

Inadequate Social Services – An Obstacle to Human Capital Formation
20.
Education is a cornerstone of an individual’s economic productivity. The 2007 Poverty
Assessment identifies education as the most important factor for higher household well-being
and emphasizes that at least 11 years of education are needed to break out of the cycle of
poverty. The education system in Nicaragua has made important strides in expanding coverage,
with primary enrollment rates reaching 88 percent in 2006. From 1998 to 2003, pre-primary and
secondary school enrollment also increased, respectively, from 23 to 31 percent and from 36 to
39 percent. However, challenges remain with respect to access, equity, efficiency and quality at
all levels, as well the overall challenge of strengthening institutional capacity and efficiency in
the sector. Repetition and dropout rates are also high: one of every three students repeats first
grade, only 69 percent complete primary school and of those who do complete only 43 percent
do so within six years (2004). The twin challenges of ensuring continued expansion in access
and continued improvements in the quality of teaching and learning continue to be pillars of the
education agenda at all levels.
21.
Health. Nicaragua made substantial progress in the health sector over the last decade.
MDGs for infant and child mortality are within reach, reflecting important advances in access to
basic health services. However, substantial challenges remain, particularly in maternal and
infant health. Maternal mortality remains high, demand for contraception is unmet, and pre-teen
and teen pregnancy rates are the highest in Latin America. Progress also recently stalled in
increasing the coverage of pre-natal care and the share of births attended by health personnel,
and vaccination coverage for tuberculosis and polio declined since 2002. Within the health
system, large inequities persist in access and quality of health services across socio-economic
groups and regions. The per capita allocation of public healthcare resources, for example, is
concentrated in richer regions, such as Managua and the Pacific. Public health services are also
geared towards curative health, despite a substantial unmet need for preventive health care.

7

22.
Nutrition and social protection. Too many Nicaraguan households suffer from chronic
malnutrition, elevated school dropout rates, and high levels of child labor, youth unemployment
and domestic violence, exacerbated by a social protection system that lacks adequate coverage
and coordination. Although the prevalence of stunting for children under 5 years old declined
from 27 to 22 percent from 1998 to 2005, more than one in five children still suffers from
chronic malnutrition with significant attendant impacts on health, cognitive capacity and lifetime
productivity. To reach the MDG goal of addressing extreme poverty as measured by chronic
malnutrition, Nicaragua would need to prioritize this goal and make rapid advances across
several sectors, including expanding access to water and sanitation, expanding growth
monitoring in children under two, launching prevention campaigns, and improving access to
maternal and child healthcare and practices. Moreover, the most vulnerable must have equal
access to quality basic services and opportunities to build their human capital and protect them
from natural and economic shocks. In addition, the social protection system must be aligned to
meet these goals.
23.
Water. Access to water improved slightly from 70.3 percent in 2001 to 71.5 percent in
2005, but appears unlikely to attain the MDG target of full coverage by 2015. Moreover, this
slight gain belies continuing challenges, including frequent water rationing, high system losses,
lack of domestic metering, low collection rates, and poor water quality, especially in rural areas.
Most Nicaraguans without access to water live in rural areas in the Atlantic, Central and North
regions. ENACAL, the state-owned water operator, remains responsible for providing services
in urban areas, while the Social Investment Fund (FISE) remains responsible for the rural sector.
Limited institutional capacities, including within the National Commission for Water and
Sanitation (CONAPAS), an inconsistent legal framework, and excessive political interference are
underlying factors impeding water coverage expansion and service quality improvements.
Infrastructural Bottlenecks – Impediments to Growth and Investment
24.
Energy. Infrastructure deficiencies hamper growth and private sector investment,
especially in energy. Energy supplies have been unreliable due to generation constraints
(obsolescence and lack of new investments) and elevated costs due to high dependency on
thermal (oil-fired) generating plants. Tariffs have been politicized and lack an automatic
adjustment mechanism. In addition, high distribution losses of 28 percent have provoked cashflow problems in the system (arrears to generators) and losses for the private sector distributor,
Union Fenosa (UF).5 The contentious relationship between UF and the Government, partially
attributable to a poorly designed and hastily executed privatization strategy, coupled with a weak
legal framework and politicized regulator discourages badly needed new private sector
investments. It is imperative to bring new generating capacity on line, rehabilitate existing
power plants to improve supply, address legal and regulatory shortcomings that impede new
capacity being added to the system, and improve the connectivity and reliability of the regional
market.
25.
Nicaragua’s 69 percent electrification rate, the lowest among Central American countries,
underscores the need to expand and improve access to rural electrification. Rural coverage is
much lower, around 34 percent, and is provided through a combination of on-grid and off-grid
extension programs. Improving the business climate in the sector will require confidence
building measures by the Government and better legal clarity to attract the sizeable private

investments necessary to turn-around performance and exit the present crisis. The State should
be more proactive in prosecuting large scale theft of electricity and facilitate the “normalization”
of poor communities that have connected illegally, with a view to gradually increasing cost
recovery in line with their ability to pay. The mandates of key state institutions in sector policy
and operations, such as the Ministry of Energy and Mines,6 the Ministry of Finance, the Instituto
Nicaragüense de Energía (INE), the National Electricity Company (ENEL) and the National
Assembly, should be better defined to clarify their respective roles as policy maker, fiscal agent,
regulator, operator and legislator. Strengthening property rights (i.e., water rights for
hydropower development) and addressing the weaknesses in the electricity law are also critical
for success.
26.
Telecommunications. After years of poor service, the GoN took bold steps to privatize
the National Telecommunications Company (ENITEL) and establish the Telecommunications
Regulatory Agency (TELCOR). New cellular licenses were granted in 2001 and 2003. Services
improved with IDA support; national coverage of fixed and mobile phones increased sevenfold
from 194,000 to more than 1.3 million in 2005, and mobile phone coverage in the provincial
capitals increased from 50 percent in 1999 to 100 percent in 2003. However, despite large
increases in fixed and mobile telephone usage, Nicaragua still has the lowest penetration rates in
Latin America (23.6 per 100 people). Moreover, despite Nicaragua’s Telecommunications
Investment Fund (FITEL), which supports improved access in rural areas by offering subsidies
where private operators are reluctant to operate, dramatic disparities persist in access to
information, technology, and telecommunication (ICT) infrastructure between urban and rural
areas. Urban centers, such as Managua, have 12.7 fixed phones per 100 inhabitants, compared to
less than 0.4 fixed phones for rural areas where more than 48 percent of the population lives.
27.
Transportation. Road networks are vital to connect people to markets and social
services, and help the poor access finance and build productive assets. However, the condition
and coverage of Nicaragua’s paved road network are the poorest in Central America; only 20
percent of 19,036 km are reported to be in good or fair condition. According to the 2005 LSMS,
a little above one-fifth (22.3 percent) of Nicaraguan households have access to a paved road;
demographically, access is 30 percent among the non-poor, but only 11 percent among the poor
and seven percent among the extreme poor. In addition, there are large inequities in access
across regions, especially the Atlantic Region.
28.
Future initiatives will need to improve and expand the paved road network for
Nicaraguan producers to effectively compete under CAFTA-DR and other potential trade
arrangements. To ensure the sustainability of the road network, it will be essential that the roads
that have been rehabilitated are not left to deteriorate and once again allowed to become
transport bottlenecks. The capacity of the Ministry of Transport Infrastructure (MTI) needs
strengthening to help it carry out road condition inventories, fully install the Pavement
Management system, and seek least cost solutions to technical and engineering problems. The
local consulting and contracting industries also require considerable capacity building. Road
network management also needs to be further decentralized; the MTI is currently responsible for
19,000 km of the road network, of which many are secondary and tertiary roads that can be
better managed locally. Urban transport also remains inadequate in Managua and other large
cities.
6

The Ministry of Energy and Mines was only recently set up under the Ortega administration and is viewed as a positive step forward, in line
with the Bank’s prior policy recommendations.

9

29.
Land. The modernization of the Cadastre and Registry systems is vital for land tenure
security and to facilitate land transactions and promote agricultural investments. However, there
are discrepancies between the Cadastre’s land records and those of the Property Registry.
Progress is being made in the modernization of the Cadastre and the Property Registry and in the
establishment of an Integrated Information System (SIICAR). A law to modernize the Cadastre
was enacted and its regulations published in 2005. The establishment of a new National
Directorate of Public Registries is pending legislative approval of the Public Registry Law.
Financial Services – Limited Access to Credit hinders SME growth
30.
Financial Sector. The Nicaraguan financial sector is no longer as fragile as it once was,
but it still requires careful supervision. After the reintroduction of private banks in the early
1990s, credit to the private sector expanded rapidly. This expansion was followed by a banking
crisis in 2000-01 leading to the closure of four banks. Since then, the financial sector has
experienced a significant process of concentration and consolidation. Following a series of
mergers and acquisitions involving international banking groups, the financial sector has grown
substantially in recent years. Banking assets rose to US$3 billion at end-December 2006,
compared with US$2.7 billion a year earlier. However, dollarization remains high,7 with 66
percent of deposits in dollars as of end-November 2006. In the Doing Business Report 2007,
Nicaragua ranks 48th in the category “Getting Credit”, sharing its rank with Argentina, while
Chile ranks 28th and Bolivia 65th. Nicaragua improved its ranking considerably through the
establishment of a new credit registry and the creation of a new private credit bureau.
31.
Today, seven private domestic commercial banks and two private finance companies
dominate the financial sector. In 2005, they provided credit to the private sector in an amount
equal to 29.1 percent of GDP, which is larger than in Peru (with 18 percent), but modest
compared to Bolivia (38.4 percent) or Chile (62.4 percent). Access to finance is generally very
limited, and long and medium term financing, especially for SMEs, is mostly unavailable. Also,
a large segment of the population does not have access to banking services, which is reflected in
a comparatively low ratio of bank deposits to GDP of 35% in 2005. On average, there are only
96 bank accounts for every 1,000 Nicaraguans, compared with 316 in Peru and more than one
per person in Chile. On the positive side, the microfinance sector has expanded by 26 percent
per year since 1999, reaching about 350,000 clients with an outstanding loan portfolio of
US$223 million by end of 2006.
Gender, Indigenous Peoples and Civil Society
32.
Gender. Some progress has been made in achieving gender equity, and the Ortega
administration has signaled its commitment in this area by appointing many more women to high
level positions than in the past. Social, cultural and legal factors hinder Nicaraguan women’s
economic development potential by limiting their access to, inter alia, opportunities, markets and
financial and technical resources. Although more women than men participate in microfinance
borrowing, they receive a smaller percentage of overall lending. In urban areas, women receive
38 percent of microfinance lending, but in the rural areas they receive only 21 percent. Women
also sometimes face discriminatory interest rates due to an unfair perception of being seen as
“high risk” borrowers. Domestic violence is prevalent and abusers are rarely prosecuted.
7

Given Nicaragua’s crawling peg exchange rate arrangement and a relatively open capital account, a reversal in
depositor confidence could lead to a rapid depletion of international reserves and threaten a financial sector crisis.

10

33.
Indigenous peoples (IP) in Nicaragua have been a historically disadvantaged minority.
In December 2002, the Indigenous Titling Law was enacted, creating an institutional framework
to promote, coordinate, and manage demarcation and titling processes. Land security for
indigenous peoples is critical to successful poverty reduction, their economic empowerment and
environmental sustainability of the protected areas in which they live. In March 2005, five titles
of indigenous communities in the Bosawas natural reserve were provisionally registered in the
two registries of Jinotega and RAAN. Progress in issuing permanent titles has been painfully
slow due to institutional bickering and lack of a political consensus. The first title was formally
handed over to the Mayagni Sauni As community in late 2006 – a historic, landmark
achievement. Recently, under the Ortega administration, four more titles were permanently
registered.
34.
Civil Society. There has been an impressive increase in the number of civil society
organizations (CSO) active in policy dialogue and social accountability at the local and national
levels. However, CSO capacity to effectively influence decisions and shape policy is still
limited. Formal participatory mechanisms are legally mandated in some areas (e.g., education
and local development), but their impact has been mixed. The lack of adequate access to public
information has been a major obstacle to more effective participation and social accountability.
Efforts to achieve a consensus on a Freedom of Access to Public Information Law had been
underway for some time now, with IDA assistance, and final legislative approval was obtained in
May of 2007.
Coping with Natural Disasters
35.
Geographic location combined with weather and geological conditions make Nicaragua
one of the world's most disaster-prone countries (see details in Annex D), with a major disaster
occurring on average every two years. In the last ten years, disasters resulted in the deaths of
over 3,300 people, displaced or adversely impacted over 1.35 million people and caused nearly
US$1.5 billion in economic losses. Recurring disasters have highlighted Nicaragua's need for
effective disaster mitigation and response management. A national System for Disaster
Prevention, Mitigation and Response (SINAPRED) was established in 2000 and has been
supported by a Bank credit in 2001 – the Natural Disaster Vulnerability Response Project.
Summary of Development Challenges
36.
Nicaragua remains the second poorest country in Latin America after Haiti. Although the
economic gains have reduced the scale and severity of poverty in Nicaragua, it is still
unacceptably high with 46 percent of the population living below the poverty line. To achieve
the Millennium Development Goals, the rate of progress will have to be stepped up. Nicaragua’s
main challenges can be grouped into five areas.
37.
Maintaining macroeconomic stability. It took almost 15 years to achieve a sustainable
external debt position, but large domestic debt is still worrisome. Nicaragua will need to
continue to spend prudently. It faces possible threats from public sector wage demands, the
temptation to give more resources to municipal governments without clear transfers of
11

responsibilities, the impact of an unsustainable pension system, and pressure to reinstitute a state
development bank.
38.
Pursuing public sector efficiency. Because public investment and spending needs will
always exceed limited public funds, careful planning is needed to ensure that what is spent is
spent well. Progress has been made as previously noted. The next steps could focus on
improving the professionalism of the civil service, expanding the use of financial management
systems, providing freedom of information that would allow citizens to hold government more
accountable, and strengthening the quality and targeting of public spending.
39.
Building a competitive investment climate. Despite real progress in recent years in
meeting the challenges of freer trade and globalization, Nicaragua is still not taking full
advantage of global markets because of infrastructure and regulatory bottlenecks. New
investments are needed to provide reliable electricity supplies and substantially increase the
network of paved roads. Bureaucratic red tape needs to be slashed to ensure predictable and
transparent regulatory processes, secure property rights, and deepen financial markets, with
special attention to providing a level playing field to help small and medium enterprises thrive.
40.
Maximizing human potential. Nicaraguans need access to quality education and
adequate nutrition and health services if they are to enjoy the benefits of a vibrant global
economy and break out of inter-generational cycles of poverty. Primary school enrollment has
increased significantly, but high drop-out and repetition rates remain a problem and access to
pre-school and secondary education remains limited. Curriculums need to be revised and
updated for greater relevance. Investment in secondary and vocational education will also be
very important to Nicaragua’s future. In health, the big challenge is to continue to expand the
coverage and quality of primary health services in affordable ways, especially with respect to
maternal and infant health. Chronic malnutrition, which remains alarmingly high, needs
immediate attention focused on a multisectoral action plan. Special efforts will be required to
provide services and opportunities to isolated populations along the Atlantic coast who have
traditionally been marginalized and, overall, to bridge gaps in access and quality of social sector
services across regions and socio-economic groups.
41.
Expanding economic opportunities for the poor, predominately in rural areas. To
boost the productivity and income-earning potential of the rural poor, tools must be provided to
help them compete globally. More funds will be needed for water, roads, telephone connections,
agricultural extension services and land titles. Nearly 80 percent of the country’s road network is
too unreliable to serve as regular transport routes. Telecommunications and electricity supplies
are still lacking in many of Nicaragua’s smallest towns and rural communities, and land titling
coverage remains limited to a few areas in Nicaragua’s northeast. Access to financial services in
rural areas is limited and will require deepening of financial markets.
Governance – an overarching theme
42.
Governance is a cross cutting theme that critically impacts the development process in a
country. The 2007 Nicaragua Institutional Government Review (IGR) provides an overview of
the political and legal system and analyzes and proposes recommendations in three areas where
IDA has comparative advantages and would avoid duplication with other donor work: i) the
regulatory system for public services, including electricity, telecommunications and water and
sanitation; ii) the real estate property registration system; and iii) accountability systems,
12

including within the Comptroller’s Office and social accountability systems.
preliminary key findings are summarized in Box 2 on the following page.

The IGR’s

43.
Public Financial Management (PFM) system. The performance of PFM systems is a
critical factor in fiscal discipline, strategic allocation, operational efficiency and transparency in
the use of scarce public funds. Building on earlier CFAA and Public Expenditure Financial
Assessment (PEFA) exercises, the Bank’s recent PER assessed Nicaragua’s PFM performance in
seven critical dimensions: (i) budget credibility; (ii) comprehensiveness and transparency; (iii)
budget planning; (iv) predictability and control in budget execution; (v) accounting, recording
and reporting; (vi) external scrutiny and auditing; and (vii) donor practices that affect PFM. The
IMF also reviewed PFM issues as part of its Nicaragua-Fiscal Strategy Brief dated January 2007.
In general, considerable progress has been made to date, especially the enactment in 2005 of
the Financial Management and Budget Regime Law (Law 550), which sets strict limits on
budget modifications and brought almost all donor assistance within the budgetary framework.
Box 2: Key Findings of the Institutional Government Review
•
The system of regulation of public services has worked well in the telecommunications sector, but faced serious difficulties
in the electricity sector, and was weak in the water and sanitation sector. Progress needs to be made to ensure the independence
and professionalism of regulatory institutions.
•
The security of property rights is quite uncertain and negatively affects the poorest Nicaraguans. The approval of the draft
Law on Public Registries, which has been under congressional review for a few years, would make the registry system more
reliable by providing a legal framework to both integrate the cadastre and legal registry, and implement the computerized
Integrated Information System (SIICAR).
•
The Comptroller’s Office has concentrated most of its efforts on investigating accusations to the detriment of planned audits.
Despite this focus, the State has not, to date, been able to recuperate any resources as a result of its investigations due to the lack
of follow up in the judicial system.
•
The execution of the country’s annual budget was audited for the first time in 2007. The Comptroller’s Office needs to
allocate adequate financial and human resources to undertake this annually.
•
Social accountability systems are very weak despite some efforts from various local civil society organizations and foreign
NGOs. The recent approval of the Freedom of Access to Public Information Law should go a long way towards improving social
accountability.

44.
However, some key weaknesses in the PFM system still need to be addressed,
including: (i) improving budget classification; (ii) reducing budgetary rigidities and earmarking,
which account for about 19 percent of total expenditures; (iii) increasing budget coverage to
include all decentralized entities; (iv) integrating the public investment system (SNIP) in the
overall budgetary formulation process; (v) strengthening budget execution and reporting
requirements; and (vi) institutionalizing annual audits of budget execution by the Office of the
Comptroller General (CGR) with subsequent accountability to the National Assembly.
45.
Public Procurement. The Government is developing an e-procurement module to
complement the existing public financial management information system, SIGFA, which, when
completely implemented, will further transparency. Currently, the public can access a webpage
with the Government’s annual procurement plan, bid invitations and contract adjudications.
Standard bidding documents have been prepared, but are still not widely used by all public
institutions. The Bank and the IADB, together with other bilateral donors, have worked
extensively with the Government to draft a new Country Procurement Law, which is expected to
13

be presented to the National Assembly for approval by end 2007. The Bank and the IADB also
provided procurement training and certification in 2006 to around 300 public officials.
III.

GOVERNMENT STRATEGY AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK

46.
The Government recently outlined a new Economic and Financial Program (EFP),
2007-2009, a short to medium term program of policies and actions based on the priorities of the
Ortega Administration, which in turn complements the longer term poverty reduction strategy of
the 2005-2009 National Development Plan. The EFP has been introduced as the Government’s
proposal for a new IMF arrangement to follow up on the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF) that expired in December 2006. The EFP is being fleshed out in further detail,
especially in the areas of poverty reduction and social policy, for future discussions with the
Bank, the IADB and other budgetary support donors. Figure 4 on page 15 shows how the
Government’s stated priorities have evolved within the framework of the NDP and the original
poverty reduction strategy, the ERCERP. The Ortega administration’s poverty reduction
strategy, the Plan for Socioeconomic Development, is a work in process that is expected to be the
subject of wide consultations and be finalized by early next year, and then presented for Board
discussion in mid-2008.
47.
The EFP has as its central objectives wealth creation and poverty reduction as
inseparable elements of the country’s economic and social development. Sustained growth
at over 5 percent per annum together with inflation under 7 percent is planned in the context of
macroeconomic stability and sustainable public finances and external accounts. The Government
intends to create a policy and institutional environment that favors public and private
investments to stimulate productivity and promote quality employment generation. Increasing
small and medium enterprise (SME) production is a key stated goal, with a focus on the agroindustrial sector by facilitating business alliances, producer associations and access to finance.
48.
The Government’s social policy will focus on immediate priorities and the
achievement of the MDGs. Budgetary expenditures, public investments and institutional
planning and execution will be better aligned with MDG targets and a system of Managing for
Results is to be introduced to monitor development impact. In general, the policy will
eschew short-term social assistance and focus on strengthening the poor’s capacity and skills to
improve their productivity, and including the poor more proactively in developing solutions to
their problems. Basic public health and education services will be provided free of charge.
49.
In education, the key objective is to provide free universal public primary education and
reduce illiteracy. The previous school autonomy system is to be reformulated because it led to
many parents having to pay for school programs and services that were deemed to be mandatory
by some school authorities. Four key stated education policies are: (i) more education – with
emphases on reducing illiteracy, achieving full primary enrollment and expanding access to preschool, secondary, technical and vocational schools; (ii) better quality education – by
improving the curriculum, strengthening teacher training, fostering responsible citizenship,
celebrating Nicaragua’s cultural diversity and rehabilitating school infrastructure (approximately
30 percent of rural schools lack potable water and 50 percent have no electricity); (iii) holistic
and integral education that stresses ethics and values and includes education beyond the
schoolroom environment; and (iv) decentralization of school management and community
participation. Teacher salaries, which could be considered low by regional standards, are to be
raised, and a full census and inventory of the public school system is to be carried out.
14

50.
In health, the policy aims to ensure that basic health services are free of charge and that
both coverage and quality are improved. Public procurement of medicines8 and medical supplies
is a priority and the purchase of generics is encouraged. Preventative family medicine is to be
delivered in a decentralization manner through seventeen local area health systems (SILAIS). A
strategy is also being developed to combat chronic malnutrition.

About 80 percent of total out-of-pocket costs for family health go to purchase medicines.

15

51.
A new policy on food security and sovereignty is envisaged that would provide,
over a five year period, about 75,000 households, or about 40 percent of the families in
extreme poverty (but who own sufficient agricultural land with titles), with access to
subsidized agricultural inputs, livestock, and extension services to eradicate hunger and
promote income generation amongst the poorest. The package being offered, known as
“Bono Productivo,” would cost around US$ 1,500 per family and complement two other
elements of the government’s flagship “Cero Hambre” program, which are micro-nutrient
supplements to children under 6 years and public school food.
52.
The policy on water and sanitation would target both coverage and service
quality. Investments would be made to reduce system losses and improve cost recovery.
A new Water Law was recently approved in May 2007 to strengthen water resource
management. The Government has identified among its priorities improving access to
water and sanitation to marginalized communities, strengthening participation of
municipalities in water resources management and environmental conservation, and
promoting rational use of water and other natural resources.
53.
The EFP is being anchored on a prudent and sustainable fiscal policy.
Poverty reduction expenditures are targeted to increase from 13.4 percent of GDP in 2006
to 17.6 percent in 2009. New public investments would focus on energy and water and
sanitation, and attention will be given to improve the finances of public entities in these
sectors. Additional fiscal resources to finance poverty reduction expenditures would be
mobilized through tax reform measures, refinancing internal debt, restructuring state
institutions, cutting expenditures in non-priority areas and obtaining external assistance.
54.
Strengthening of the macroeconomic framework (see Table 2 on the following
page) is expected to continue over the medium term and to serve as the basis for the
Government’s social spending agenda. The significant financial sector development over
the last decade is also expected to continue and together with improved prudential
regulation contribute to foster economic growth. As indicated in paragraph 11, several
important factors that had contributed to macroeconomic instability and low growth in
Nicaragua have been eliminated or significantly reduced (e.g., banking sector weaknesses
and the pre-election spending boom). These two developments alone should help raise
Nicaragua’s growth rate above the average level achieved since 2001. Moreover, a
medium-term growth rate of 5 percent is not overly ambitious when compared with
average growth rates achieved in other lower-middle income countries worldwide, or
with Nicaragua’s own growth rates in the second half of the last decade. 9

9

Note that the growth simulations reported in the 2004 Nicaragua DPR (Annex C) indicate that Nicaragua, under a modest reform
scenario, can expect to grow by over 5 percent per annum over the next decade (which raises the values of its growth determining
variables to the top 25th percentile of the LAC).

Debt Sustainability. An updated joint IDA-IMF Low Income Country (LIC)
Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) was recently completed in August 2007 (see Annex
G). The analysis indicates that the risk of Nicaragua experiencing debt distress is
moderate, but manageable, provided that sound macroeconomic policies are applied.
Nicaragua’s external debt in net present value (NPV) terms is expected to decline from
40 percent of GDP in 2005 to about 28 percent of GDP by the end of 2007. However,
Nicaragua also has a high level of domestic debt, which is projected to reach 21 percent
of GDP (in NPV terms) by the end of 2007. The DSA indicates that this combined debt
of approximately 49 percent of GDP, or 57 percent in nominal terms, is manageable
under the macroeconomic framework projected for 2007 (characterized by annual GDP
growth of around 4 percent and a primary fiscal deficit of less than one percent of GDP).
Nevertheless, this overall public debt is still high, leaving Nicaragua vulnerable to
destabilization from internal and external shocks (key sources of risks were identified in
the PER and are listed in Box 1). The results of the joint DSA also conclude that the
17

fiscal stance of the program presented by Nicaraguan authorities is consistent with
declining public debt ratios over the medium term. The DSA also considers an
alternative scenario with an increase in concessionary oil financing from Venezuela
under an ALBA agreement, assuming annual inflows equivalent to 0.8 percent of GDP.
Even with these higher inflows, the total external debt levels are deemed manageable.
56.
External trade policy would promote export growth and diversification. In
addition to maximizing trade prospects under CAFTA-DR, the Government intends to
sign new trade deals with ALBA, CARICOM, the EU, Brazil, Canada, Taiwan, Iran and
Panama. Negotiations on a Central American Customs Union are also being advanced.
Monetary policy would continue the existing crawling peg arrangements and improve
the domestic payments system. Open market operations of the Central Bank and reserves
management would be consistent with maintaining adequate financial system liquidity
and low and stable inflation. Net International Reserves would be targeted at 2.1 times
the monetary base.
57.
A reform agenda complementary to the above mentioned policies and actions is
also being proposed in the EFP to advance pending structural activities that include:
(i) building consensus on a fiscal responsibility framework; (ii) obtaining consensus
between employers and beneficiaries on an actuarially sound pension system;
(iii) pursuing decentralization to municipalities; (iv) establishing a development bank to
improve access to credits for SME producers; (v) attracting new electricity generation
capacity, especially in renewable energy; and (vi) strengthening Central Bank capacity.

IV.

WORLD BANK GROUP – NICARAGUA PARTNERSHIP
(FY03 – FY07)

58.
The FY03-05 CAS and the FY06-07 ISN were aligned around the first PRSP
which was later revised and renamed as the National Development Plan in 2005. The
CAS Completion Report attached in Annex C and the evaluations by the IEG of the
PRSP process attached in Annex F provide a detailed assessment of Bank Group
performance and lessons learned going forward. Although the CAS’s core objective to
reduce extreme poverty was not achieved, achievements were made across the program
with considerable progress in promoting a stable macroeconomic environment, reducing
the fiscal deficit significantly, doubling exports and lowering external debt to sustainable
levels by achieving the HIPC Completion Point and obtaining further debt reduction
through the MDRI. Though the Bank was instrumental in the increase of poverty
spending from 9.6 percent of GDP in 2002 to 13.6 percent in 2006, greater expenditure
has yet to translate into significant gains in poverty reduction.
Progress made in critical areas
59.
The Bank’s budgetary support operations combined with those of other donors
played a critical role in furthering policy dialogue and economic reform. This
contributed to macroeconomic stability and modest growth. Significant progress was
also made in each of the following strategic areas: (i) Broad-based economic growth
and structural reform. Annual growth, though uneven, was modest, averaging around
18

one percent per capita during the CAS period. Consolidated public debt fell from over
200 percent of GDP to 65 percent in 2006, and the fiscal deficit fell from 6.6 percent to
less than one percent, reflecting buoyant tax revenues. International reserves also
increased substantially to cover about 2.9 months of imports. Important gains were made
in improving the investment climate, increasing employment, simplifying business
registration procedures, and doubling exports. Following the 2000-2001 banking crisis,
the Government’s response led to a quick stabilization of the financial sector, albeit at
considerable cost. (ii) Investment in human capital development. Progress was made
in increasing primary school enrollment, strengthening Social Investment Fund (FISE)
programs for road and health center construction and increasing attended births.
(iii) Productive and social public infrastructure. Most notable was the construction of
about 240 km of secondary and rural roads using the adoquine method, which has proven
to be both less costly and more durable. The Bank also financed the rehabilitation of
about 150 km of national highways and promoted the development of the microenterprise model for routine maintenance. Telephone coverage, mainly cellular,
expanded significantly after privatization was introduced. Progress was also made in
modernizing the land registry system, and the landmark of registering several indigenous
territories was achieved. Many municipalities improved their infrastructure to cope with
natural disasters through the implementation of mitigation works. (iv) Good governance
and institutional development. A new civil service law was implemented and public
financial management improved after the establishment of a single treasury account and
the passing of the financial administration law.
…but there were key shortcomings
60.
Areas less successful with respect to the CAS objectives included the following:
(i) In economic growth, the resolution of the banking crises of 2000-2001 led to a
significant increase in internal public debt, which remains an area of some concern. The
failure to achieve full fiscal neutrality of municipal transfers as decentralization was
accelerated and the postponement of the pension reform due to serious design flaws were
key setbacks. (iii) Investment in human capital development also saw less successful
results due to service delivery and quality problems in public services, especially health
and education. No serious attempt was made to implement a national policy on social
protection. In education, the school autonomy model was questioned due to weaknesses
in financial management (e.g. school management charging discretional fees, arrears to
utilities, etc.) and the policy was reversed under the new administration. (iii) Similarly,
less successful aspects of social and productive infrastructure development included
the lack of consensus on a new land registry law, and the fact that privatization of the
energy distribution system failed to lead to better service, leading to widespread public
disenchantment. (iv). Finally, in good governance and institutional development, there
continue to be very poor institutional capacity development in public institutions and
weak and politicized utility regulation.

19

Box 3: Lessons and Recommendations
Budget Support is critical for policy dialogue and reform

Maintain broad donor support through the Budget Support Group process.

Need to simplify and use a common performance assessment matrix.
Aid fragmentation hampers development impact

Greater need for donor’s selectivity and larger operations to avoid aid dispersion.
Government ownership and commitment

Institutional reforms and design and implementation of public policies and programs are more successful
when there are political consensus and unwavering commitment from the Government over a sustained period.

Constant turnover of ministers and project implementation staff directly affect the quality of project
implementation.

Need to involve the National Assembly in policy discussions and in project design phases to ensure buy-in and
support.
Public outreach and stakeholder consultation

Need for adequate time for consultations within government and civil society to ensure understanding and
ownership by beneficiaries of programs.

Managua is not Nicaragua – need to broaden coverage of stakeholder consultations.
Strengthening institutional capital in project design and implementation

Project design should better reflect existing institutional capacity of the Government and include capacity
strengthening components – instead of relying on quick fixes such as project implementation units (PIUs).

The practice of financing public officials in line functions as “consultants” and paying them well above public
sector salaries (quite often based on private sector comparators) is distortionary and does not build public
institutional capacity.

Better coordination and information flows between government institutions are desirable.
Need to strengthen donor alignment and harmonization agenda

Notable progress in donor harmonization and alignment, but much more needs to be done to improve
development impact.

Concerted effort needed to ensure quality of Bank’s supervision in Sector Wide Approaches (SWAp) and
similar operations.

Harmonization and Alignment (H&A) agenda should include strengthening of national systems.
Monitoring and Evaluation
 National M&E systems still weak and inadequate (despite costly investments by donors).

61.
Portfolio Quality and Financial Management. Overall, portfolio quality
improved steadily through the CAS period (see details in Annex C). A financial
management specialist has been placed in the Country Office to systematically follow up
on the two areas where there were weaknesses, namely improving audit compliance and
monitoring Special Accounts, with particular emphasis on projects that have lapsed or are
about to close.
62.
IFC’s Contribution. IFC’s efforts were centered primarily on under-served
segments, including the MSME sector, small-scale farmers and lower-income households
(see details in Annex C, paragraphs 51-53). IFC’s activities in the past had been limited
partly due to a business enabling environment that was not conducive to private sector
development. Since then, there has been considerable progress, particularly in
simplifying business regulations at the municipal level to improve the investment climate.
Working with financial sector institutions, IFC has had a catalytic role in improving
access to finance for MSMEs. Finally, IFC’s investments in three firms are helping to
finance innovative schemes to expand linkages with smaller producers and vendors and
support corporate social responsibility initiatives. These three projects are: (i) financing
to a leading sugar exporter for its upgrading and expansion and advisory support to
promote MSME supply chain linkages between the sugar mill and surrounding
communities; (ii) financing to a regional project for an international agricultural
commodities company to establish a capital lending program to improve the production
20

practices of small-holder coffee suppliers in Central America – related advisory work is
helping 1,500 coffee farmers in Nicaragua achieve certification; and (iii) an investment in
the retail sector where the IFC is supporting the company in the training of its MSME
tenants to improve their business practices. IFC’s portfolio (on a commitments basis) has
grown from US$6.3 million at the end of FY03 to US$52.6 million (including US$11.5
million for Participants’ account) at the end of FY07, while advisory services stand at
about US$5 million approved to date. Around 50 percent of advisory services are linked
to IFC’s investment portfolio, which is high compared to other countries in the region.
Development Partners – Harmonization and Alignment for Development Impact
63.
Nicaragua remains highly aid dependent with over 30 percent of its budget
coming from ODA in its recent past. With aid disbursements of around US$550 million
annually and with over forty donor countries10 and institutions involved, aid
harmonization and alignment are major challenges and improvements should lead to
greater aid effectiveness. Nicaragua has played a leading role internationally in the
harmonization of donor practices and pushed assertively for greater use of sector wide
approaches (SWAps) and more predictable budgetary support. Nicaragua has been a
pilot country for a number of Organization for Economic Development/Development
Assistance Committee (OECD/DAC) Harmonization and Alignment (H&A) initiatives,
and it has prepared, jointly with donor partners, a 2005 National Plan for H&A with
country-specific indicators and a monitoring mechanism embedded in local processes.
Bilateral assistance accounted for 45 percent and multilateral assistance for 55 percent of
all aid disbursed during 2002-2006. Of the total aid disbursed in the same period, about
55 percent were donations.
64.
The institutional arrangements for donor harmonization take place at
several levels. The Donors Global Roundtable (mesa global de donantes) is the most
inclusive forum with most donors participating. A subset of nine donors who provide
generalized budgetary support have formed a Budget Support Group (BSG), which, in
addition to the Bank, includes the European Union, the Netherlands, Sweden,
Switzerland, Germany, Finland, Norway and Great Britain. The IADB has indicated that
it will be joining the BSG shortly. A Joint Financing Agreement (JFA) was agreed with
the Government in 2005 to guide and harmonize budgetary support and agree on a
Performance Assessment Matrix (PAM). Finally, Sector Working Groups (mesas
sectoriales) have been established to coordinate donor assistance in key sectors. The new
administration will need to take clear ownership and leadership of these mechanisms if
harmonization is to lead to more effective and tangible development impact.
65.
The Bank, for its part, has been the second largest donor during the 20022006 period (about $434 million disbursed) and has been recognized for its high
quality analytical work, leadership in policy dialogue, setting fiduciary and safeguard
standards, and its catalytic role in promoting the use of SWAps in education, health and
rural development (PRORURAL). The Bank also played a critical role in keeping the
Government and donors focused on achieving the HIPC Completion Point and obtaining
further debt reduction through the MDRI.
10

See Annex J for a mapping of external donors against economic sectors where they are active.

21

66.
The Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) is the largest single donor, and
accounted for about 22 percent of all aid disbursed during 2002-2006. Though the IADB
is still in the process of preparing its new CAS, it has agreed on an interim operative
program for 2007-2008 that includes eight investment operations totaling US$160 million
and two policy-based loans for US$20 million each. Major areas of focus are: (i) energy
– about US$73 million will support priority investments to reduce system losses,
rehabilitate generation plants and transmission lines, promote energy efficiency and
finance a program to “formalize” connections to poor neighborhoods that are presently
hooked up illegally; (ii) health networks, US$20 million; (iii) housing, US$15 million;
(iv) poverty reduction, US$20 million; and (v) the Managua Water Basin, US$10
million. A significant package of technical assistance has also been tentatively agreed,
which includes support for the design of a development bank, preparation of a national
tourism development strategy, investment promotion, and public investment
programming in housing, energy and the environment.
67.
The European Union (Member States and the European Commission (EC))
accounts for more than 50 percent of all cooperation aid, and during 2002-2006 the EC
for its part disbursed a total of US$232 million. The EC has recently finalized its
Country Strategy Paper Nicaragua, 2007-2013, during which its National Indicative
Program (NIP) allocation amounts to approximately Euro 214 million. The three focal
areas for EC support are: (i) governance, democracy and rule of law (20 percent of
total NIP), (ii) education (35 percent), and (iii) macroeconomic stability, trade and
business climate (40 percent). The preferred financing instruments are non-earmarked
budgetary support and SWAps. Technical assistance for institutional capacity building
and cross-cutting issues, such as the environment, would receive 5 percent of NIP
allocations.
68.
In July 2005, the Millennium Challenge Corporation’s (MCC) Board of
Directors approved a five-year compact with the Nicaraguan Government for US$175
million. The MCC’s development strategy addresses property rights, under-developed
infrastructure, and low value agriculture production, and focuses on the northwestern
region of the country where there is significant economic growth potential due to its
fertile land and strategic geographic location (neighboring Honduras and El Salvador).
The MCC will provide a total of US$26.5 million to improve the property registry with a
gender focus; US$92.8 million to improve 58 kilometers of the Pacific Corridor between
Managua and León; and US$33.7 million to extend rural business development services
for higher profit agriculture. In addition, US$22 million will be provided for program
management, oversight, and monitoring and evaluation.

V. WORLD BANK GROUP – NICARAGUA PARTNERSHIP
STRATEGY (FY08-12)
69.
The Bank Group’s Nicaragua Country Partnership Strategy (FY08-12) would
support the Government’s development objective of wealth creation and poverty
reduction through more broadly shared economic growth. The program intends to
strengthen sector dialogue and reform by effectively implementing our ongoing
operational portfolio of 11 projects (detailed in Figure 5, following page, which includes
US$141 million yet to be disbursed), and disseminating a number of recently completed
22

AAA products that have decisively influenced this CPS’s design. These include a
Poverty Assessment (including a qualitative Voices of the Poor contribution), a Public
Expenditure Review, an Energy Policy Note (all FY07 deliverables), and an Institutional
Governance Review (FY08). Bank staff will also work with donor partners, who
together have about US$1,350 million in additional undisbursed funds committed for CY
2007-2012, to ensure greater donor alignment to the new administration’s priorities and a
more coordinated attempt at harmonization to improve overall development impact.

The proposed CPS for Nicaragua (FY08-12) is firmly aligned to the
Government’s priorities and its evolving poverty reduction strategy and structured around
support for four strategic objectives: (i) reactivating the economy, stimulating
productivity and competitiveness; (ii) human capital development – improving
social equity and opportunity; (iii) infrastructure and sustainable development; and
(iv) strengthening governance and accountability by modernizing state institutions
and promoting citizen participation. Figure 6 on the following page provides an
overview of the Bank Group’s proposed CPS of ongoing lending, new proposed lending,
AAA services and IFC operations in support of these four strategic objectives.
71.
Proposed new lending is anchored on a series of annual budgetary support
operations (PRSCs) to constructively engage the government on key policy reforms,
while selectively undertaking up to five or six new investment operations in areas where
the Bank has comparative advantages. New lending could indicatively amount to
US$240 million equivalent11 depending on: (i) Nicaragua’s country performance rating;
(ii) performance ratings of other IDA recipients; (iii) reactivation of any IDA countries
currently on non-accrual status; and (iv) total IDA15 and IDA16 resources mobilized and
made available. During the recently held CPS consultations, the Government confirmed
its interest in new investment credits in water and sanitation, roads, land administration

and public sector management. The Bank will also continue as an active donor in support
of EFA-FTI in the education sector (see Box 4, page 29).
72.
Budgetary Support Lending. Five annual Poverty Reduction Support Credits
(PRSCs) during FY08-12 of about US$20 million each are proposed. These would help
provide the Government with budgetary support to ensure predictability in financial
programming. Key policy areas for engagement include elements related to the strategic

objectives mentioned above, namely: governance and public sector management, investment
climate (property rights and regulatory institutions), and social sector development. Although
the relatively positive working relationship that the new Government has with the National
Assembly bodes well for passing a progressive legislative agenda (and thus policy-based
credits), the Government has strongly indicated that it does not want to include specific
legislative action as part of any future donor operation. Should the Government’s reform
program stall, macroeconomic conditions deteriorate significantly, or the Bank fail to secure a
credible policy matrix to underpin budgetary support lending, PRSC resources would be
reallocated to less risky investment operations.
73.
The tentative investment lending program, FY08-12, is intended to finance
investments and capacity building in public sector management, urban and rural water, land
administration and transport as detailed in Table 3 below.

The Bank will also continue to be actively engaged in the EFA-FTI Trust Fund in
education.

74.
IFC aims to help accelerate private sector development and help facilitate Nicaraguans to
take advantage of globalization and free trade agreements, supporting projects at both the
regional and country levels. In Central America, IFC has been focusing on deepening regional
integration, with priorities including: i) strengthening and broadening the financial sector
(including access to term financing by MSMEs); ii) helping improve physical infrastructure;
iii) supporting competitive firms in agriculture, industry and services; and iv) promoting southsouth investments and local companies’ becoming regional and global players. These priorities
are reflected in IFC’s operations in Nicaragua, with emphases placed on: a) improving the
investment climate by simplifying business regulations at the municipal level; b) strengthening
MSMEs’ competitiveness and their access to finance; c) assisting exporters and hard currency
earners, such as in agribusiness and tourism; and d) addressing critical infrastructure needs such
as energy (including renewable energy) and transport. IFC’s engagement in Nicaragua has
increased considerably during the last few years and the outlook for further expansion looks
promising. The co-location of IFC’s advisory services staff in the Bank’s Country Office in
Managua provides an ideal arrangement to leverage Bank-IFC synergies in the coming CPS
period.

Actual project amounts will be aligned, within each replenishment period, with Nicaragua’s performance-based
allocations.

Selectivity of Bank Group Operations
75.
For the proposed CPS, FY08-12, the Bank, like the other major donors, intends to be
selective in choosing focal areas for engagement. The annual series of budgetary support
operations (PRSCs) together with the associated technical assistance credit (PSTAC2) would
allow the Bank to engage in the overall reform program of the Government in governance and
public sector modernization, the investment climate and improvements in social service
provision. New investment operations would be limited to urban and rural water and
sanitation, public sector management, land administration, and rural roads. The Bank
would also aim for a phased disengagement and/or exit strategy in sectors where other donors are
willing and capable to take leadership. The Bank’s ongoing portfolio of eleven operations (see
Figure 5 on page 23), many of them relatively new, and the package of AAA products presently
being finalized (the Poverty Assessment, the Public Expenditure Review, the Institutional
Governance Review and the Energy Policy Note), provide ample opportunities to stay engaged
on key policy issues, while allowing other donor partners to progressively take the lead role in
areas such as energy, environment, agriculture, rural development and municipal
decentralization. In natural disaster management, where the IADB and the UN system agencies
are better positioned to take a lead role at the country level due to their greater field presence and
ready access to multi-disciplinary specialist skills, the Bank would focus on the design of a
regional catastrophic risk insurance pooling mechanism, similar to the successful Caribbean
initiative.13 Some BSG donors, including the European Commission, have been actively
working on judicial reform. The Organization for American States (OAS) and the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP) have been engaged in furthering political and legislative
reform. The Bank intends to proactively work with the authorities to ensure better aid
effectiveness within the overall donor assistance program.
76.
The Bank Group has unique comparative advantages that we intend to build upon in
business climate strengthening and private sector development. Several IFC staff are colocated at the Bank’s Country Office providing a range of advisory services intended to improve
the productivity and competitiveness of Nicaraguan firms. Recognizing the Bank’s advantage,
and its convening powers and facilitation skills, the U.K. Department for International
Development (DfID) has seconded a private sector specialist to the Bank. We will also look to
maximize IFC and MIGA engagement in Nicaragua, especially in private sector development
and infrastructure through investments related advisory services and guarantee operations.
Bank Group Activities and Results Expected
77.
The CPS Results Matrix is attached as Annex B. The Matrix provides an overview of all
ongoing and proposed Bank activities in support of the four strategic objectives that underpin the
Government’s overall goal of wealth creation and poverty reduction through broadly shared
growth, and clearly indicates what are the monitored outcomes and intermediate milestones
expected during the CPS period (FY08-12). A short summary follows (see Figure 6, page 24).

Strategic Objective I:
Competitiveness

Reactivating the Economy, Stimulating Productivity and

78.
Proposed new lending to support the above objective includes a series of budget support
credits (PRSCs) and a repeater project for Land Administration that would complement ongoing
operations such as Broad Based Access to Finance, Enhanced Competitiveness and the first Land
Administration credit. An Investment Climate Assessment is envisaged for FY08 to take stock
of progress to date and identify remaining bottlenecks. IFC will seek to play an active role in
furthering economic resurgence through investments and advisory services. A Country
Economic Memorandum (CEM) is planned for FY10 which would assess the complementary
agenda in support of maximizing benefits of trade arrangements and opportunities from regional
integration and globalization. A Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) Update is
scheduled for late 2008 to identify remaining weaknesses and suggest remedial actions.
79.
To create a favorable Business Enabling Environment (BEE), IFC is providing
assistance in business simplification at the municipal level, with a focus on those regulations
blocking MSME growth in Leon, Masaya, Managua, Granada, Chinandega, Rivas, Matagalpa
and San Juan del Sur. Ten municipalities were included in the Municipal Scorecard 200714 to
further improve their private sector enabling environments and strengthen social accountability.
Three additional municipalities are now considering joining this initiative.
80.
Complementing the BEE advisory services, IFC will continue to focus on helping
MSMEs increase their access to finance and improve their competitiveness and business
opportunities by helping to link together smaller producers and larger well established companies
in Sustainable Value Chains, mainly in the agribusiness and forestry sectors. In agribusiness,
the IFC supported innovative firms to integrate corporate social responsibility initiatives into
core business operations. In one case, a leading sugar exporter, for which IFC provided
US$36.5 million financing (including US$11.5 million in syndications) for its upgrading and
expansion, is also being considered for IFC’s advisory support to help the sponsor to work with
the local community in planting eucalyptus trees on eroded land, fuel thermal power plants
installed in the nearby sugar mills, and improve environmental and social practices. In another
case, IFC provided US$25 million in a regional project for an international agricultural
commodities company to establish a capital lending program to improve the production practices
of small-holder coffee suppliers in Central America. To date, IFC has helped Nicaraguan coffee
producers obtain about US$5 million for thirteen investment projects related to meeting
certification standards. This project was complemented by another IFC advisory project that is
helping 1,500 coffee farmers in Nicaragua to achieve certification, sell to large multinational
buyers and significantly increase their income.
81.
Forestry is yet another area that holds considerable promise for both IFC investments
and advisory services, with the latter assisting indigenous and local communities in obtaining
social and environmental certification from the Forestry Stewardship Council for sustainable
forest commercialization. Under the Forest Law and Enforcement of Governance initiative
(FLEG), the Bank will support the Government to improve forest sector governance and
legislative compliance, while enabling an investment friendly environment and ensuring fair

access rights and opportunities to indigenous and ethnic communities in the Atlantic Coast
region. BEE and Sustainable Value Chain AS activities complement, and are being coordinated
with, the Bank’s recently approved Enhanced Competitiveness Credit (FY07).
82.
In the financial sector, IFC has been supporting via its Access to Finance advisory
services work to develop the housing finance, microfinance and leasing markets and has strong
complementarities with the Bank’s Broad-Based Access to Finance Credit. IFC has provided
advice on the legal framework to facilitate leasing activities. Once the draft Law on Leasing is
approved, IFC stands ready to provide institution building support to banks and leasing
companies, tax authorities and judges to ensure a successful and vibrant leasing market. Like
most of Central America, the financial services sector in Nicaragua is undergoing rapid
consolidation and attracting regional and global players, like GE Capital and HSBC. IFC could
play a useful role in strengthening the corporate governance and balance sheets of mid-sized,
local banks which would lead to further financial sector deepening. IFC’s investments in a
leading microfinance institution and a recent US$20 million investment and TA package to a
local bank for MSME financing and housing loans for low income households are examples of
this.
83.
IFC also seeks to support companies aiming at becoming regional and global players, in
particular, via south-south investments. In supporting competitive firms in agriculture, industry
and services, IFC will seek opportunities to promote exporters and hard-currency earners, such
as tourism operators, to increase Nicaragua’s gains from trade. Tourism sector investments
along Nicaragua’s Pacific Coast are blossoming. IFC has had some exploratory discussions with
potential investors. The prospects are even better on the Atlantic Coast, if infrastructure
connectivity is significantly improved. The Bank’s ongoing rural roads, electrification and
telecommunications projects could play a catalytic role in this respect.
Strategic Objective II:
Opportunity

Human Capital Development – Improving Social Equity and

84.
Proposed new lending in support of this objective would consist of the proposed PRSC
series and continued support for the EFA-FTI Expanded Catalytic Fund (see Box 4 on the
following page). A Social Sector PER will be undertaken to provide support to improve the
efficiency and effectiveness of spending in health, education and social protection. This will
underpin key areas of the PRSC and will complement ongoing operations such as Education and
Health II, the latter focused on maternal and child health. A Poverty Assessment Update is
scheduled towards the end of the CPS period to help measure progress in improving the targeting
of poverty spending. Additionally, specific non-lending technical assistance will be provided to
help Nicaragua develop and implement a national strategy for combating chronic malnutrition.
A proposed Regional Study on Social Service Delivery and Accountability will focus on
linkages between governance and results, and facilitate the dissemination of best practices. In
the health sector, IFC plans to consider further investments in support of private health care
facilities; a potential niche exists in Central America for a high quality, affordable health care
hub as a cheaper alternative to the USA.

28

Box 4: EFA - FTI in Nicaragua
The Education For All-Fast Track Initiative (EFA-FTI) in Nicaragua was endorsed in 2003 and, to date, Nicaragua has benefited
from $17 million from the multi-donor Catalytic Fund (CF) trust managed by the World Bank. Support from the CF is envisaged
as a way to enable countries to scale up the implementation of sector programs in coordination with a range of interested donors.
Since the endorsement of the EFA-FTI, Nicaragua has achieved promising results in sector planning, harmonization of external
financing, donor coordination and reduction of transaction costs for government officials as well as external agencies supporting
the sector.
In 2007 the EFA-FTI partners at the international level scaled up the Catalytic Fund (CF) into what is now called the Expanded
Catalytic Fund (ECF). The main objective of the ECF is to provide a predictable source of funding to enable eligible recipients
to engage in long-term planning, which has been a weakness of the EFA-FTI. The Bank and other participating donors expect to
continue providing technical support to Nicaragua to update the technical content and cost/financing framework of the sector
plan, with a view to both leveraging external financing and applying to the ECF for a third allocation in 2008.

Strategic Objective III: Infrastructure and Sustainable Development
85.
Proposed new lending would consist of credits for urban and rural water and sanitation
and a follow-up operation in secondary and rural roads. The Government has requested that the
Bank take a leadership role in articulating water sector policy and harmonizing donor assistance.
The Bank plans to provide significant financing, about US$80 million, for water sector
investments over FY08-12. Ongoing credits, which consist of the recently approved Roads IV
(FY07), and the Rural Electrification, Rural Telecom and Agricultural Technology 2 credits, are
all making innovative and path-breaking contributions in infrastructure and sustainable
development. Advisory services would also be made available to help provide timely responses
to the energy crisis. A Country Environment Analysis is also programmed for FY09, which
would examine pressing environmental issues, institutional capacities and constraints and
develop strategies for promoting environmentally sustainable development. The Bank’s Water
and Sanitation TA program, together with a proposed Policy and Human Resource Development
(PHRD) grant for project preparation, would facilitate the Bank’s increased engagement in the
water sector. A regional study, the Central American Probabilistic Risk Assessment (CAPRA)
would help to strengthen the analytical underpinnings of risk management and to design a
regional risk insurance pooling mechanism.
86.
Although the IADB would take the lead role in energy, the IFC and the Bank intend to
work closely together to develop business opportunities in energy, especially from renewable
sources. Nicaragua has considerable potential in hydro, geothermal, wind and solar power that
has been barely tapped, but which would be seriously attractive to investors if political and
country risks were mitigated and reduced, and the business climate improved. The Bank’s
ongoing technical assistance for energy sector reform is important in this respect. Prospects are
also good for investing in bio-fuel production from palm oil and sugar. IFC has recently
supported the production of ethanol by a leading sugar exporter, and is currently working on
another project for energy cogeneration from bagasse and eucalyptus. IFC will continue to
actively look for opportunities to address the critical needs of the energy sector as well as other
infrastructure sectors such as transport. Utilizing its global expertise, IFC is prepared to provide
advisory services in strengthening the regulatory framework, in project structuring and
facilitating private sector participation in infrastructure.

29

Strategic Objective IV: Strengthening Governance and Accountability by Modernizing State
Institutions and Promoting Citizen Participation
87.
Proposed new lending would include the proposed PRSC series and the follow-up
Technical Assistance Credit, PSTAC 2. An ongoing Public Sector TA Credit together with a
multi-donor Trust Fund is providing capacity building and modernization support to improve
governance and accountability in public institutions. A major focus has been strengthening
public financial management and civil service reform. Three recent pieces of AAA anchor the
Bank’s ongoing dialogue with the Government on public sector reform and governance. These
are the Poverty Assessment (FY07), the Public Expenditure Review (FY07), and the Institutional
Governance Review (FY08). Proposed AAA includes a Social Sector PER in FY08, and updates
of the PER and PEFA towards the end of the CPS period. Assistance on promoting rule of law
and furthering the professionalization of the judiciary is being provided by the European
Commission and other BSG members. The Bank will continue to work with civil society
organizations to strengthen the demand for more effective social accountability by supporting
implementation of the recently approved Freedom of Access to Public Information Law. To
improve outcomes, public-private partnerships will be promoted to institutionalize social
accounting mechanisms in health and education.
88.
Monitoring and Evaluation. The Government of Nicaragua is committed to improving
its monitoring and evaluation systems to help strengthen transparency and accountability, and
has requested donor support for this effort, which is being coordinated by UNDP. The Bank will
continue to be an active participant in these efforts by supporting Central Ministries (Finance,
Foreign Affairs, SETEC and the National Information and Statistics Institute (INIDE)) and key
line ministries, notably Education and Health, in generating reliable statistics on a regular basis
and building capacity for better monitoring and evaluation. Trust funds, the PSTAC operation,
and sectoral projects will be used to finance Bank support in this area.
CPS Consultations and Outreach
89.
The CPS consultations broadly validated the Government’s development strategy and the
Bank Group’s proposed activities in support of this strategy. Two key sets of consultations were
programmed, and both were supported by DfID financing. First, there was a series of thematic
workshops on key development challenges and governmental priorities and, second, a broad
process of consultations on the Bank partnership strategy (see Annex E). Additional insights on
the developmental priorities of poor households came from a qualitative survey carried out
during preparation of the 2007 Poverty Assessment (see Box 5).
Box 5: What the Poor Say
To complement the quantitative analysis based on the 2005 Household Survey (LSMS), the 2007 Nicaragua Poverty
Assessment carried out a qualitative survey, using a methodology similar to the Voices of the Poor, of about 150 households
in 18 different poor communities over three months. The most important development priorities identified by the poor in
order of ranking were: water, construction and repair of roads, productive opportunities and health. These findings
correlate highly with the quantitative assessments, except for education, which households tend to see as a medium for longterm investment rather than an immediate priority.

30

90.
Key messages received during the consultation process, and which have influenced
the Government’s strategy and the design of the Bank’s CPS, include: (i) the importance of
micro and small farmers and businesses’ having access to credit with affordable interest rates,
(ii) the need to strengthen citizen participation and social auditing opportunities, (iii) the desire
that decentralization processes be better articulated from the local level to the national level,
(iv) the importance of rapidly expanding land titling processes, and (v) the value in investing in
infrastructure development to facilitate the country’s economic and social development.
Risks Mitigation and Response
91.
The main risks to the Bank Group’s FY08-12 Country Partnership Strategy arise from the
possibility that the new administration may be unable to generate broad consensus on the
politically challenging reform agenda or to resist measures that could threaten macro stability,
undermine investor confidence and jeopardize growth prospects. Key threats to macroeconomic
stability stem from vulnerabilities due to high levels of dollarization, potentially unsustainable
increases in public sector wages, failure to resolve the energy crisis and off budget aid flows
without adequate control. Despite recent declines, Nicaragua's public debt is still considerable
and will require positive primary fiscal balances to maintain debt sustainability. These risks will
be addressed by maintaining a continuous and close dialogue with the authorities and
coordinating with key stakeholders, including the IMF and the Budget Support Group. In
addition, the Government and the private sector have established a number of thematic working
groups15 to maintain a fluid dialogue and ensure adequate feedback. Weak institutional capacity,
exacerbated by civil service turnover, is a risk that could hinder reform and program
implementation. This is being mitigated by maintaining a continuous dialogue with the
authorities through the PRSC series, support for capacity building through technical assistance,
and strengthening Country Office staffing with fiduciary and sector expertise. Natural Disasters
also pose a significant risk during the CPS period, which is being partially mitigated by: (i) the
possibility of making pipeline and portfolio adjustments as necessary; and (ii) undertaking AAA
to better identify risks and their impacts (i.e. the CAPRA study) and possible assistance for the
design of a regional risk insurance mechanism. A final key risk stems from the challenges of
effective donor harmonization and alignment. The Bank will strengthen its strategic role in
enhancing the Government’s capacity to lead these processes and work closely with our donor
partners to follow up on the implementation of the national harmonization and alignment plan.
A mid-term CPS Progress Report is scheduled for early 2010, which will allow the Bank to
review and discuss necessary adjustments.
92.
A summary of the key risks, risk mitigation measures and likely Bank responses is
provided in Table 4 on the next page.

The Vice-President coordinates these Working Groups, which consist of nine economic clusters (tourism,
manufacturing, meat, dairy, coffee, agro-industry, fisheries, sugar and peanuts) and six cross-cutting issues, namely
energy, infrastructure, finance, technical and vocational education, social and the Atlantic Coast.

macroeconomic framework for
growth and poverty reduction

Fiscal and macroeconomic challenges
include:
-

Increase in quality and efficiency of
targeted poverty spending.
Maintenance of sustainable external
and internal debt levels.
Maintenance of fiscal discipline in
National Budget.

Principal macroeconomic indicators are
consistent with fiscal and macro stability
and sustainability.
The targeting, quality and efficiency of
poverty reduction expenditures have
been improved as reflected by the
poverty incidence of poverty reduction
expenditures.
Baseline: 47% (2005)
Target: 55% (2011)

II. HUMAN CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT: IMPROVING SOCIAL EQUITY AND OPPORTUNITY
Reduce chronic malnutrition
among children (0-5 years old)

Improved access to health
services and improved health
outcomes for women and
children

Programs to combat chronic
malnutrition are insufficient and not
effectively coordinated. High chronic
malnutrition rates affect cognitive
capacity of young children. Insufficient
focus on preventing malnutrition in 0-2
year olds. Need for coordination with
water and sanitation programs given
high correlation of malnutrition and lack
of potable water and sanitation.
Low percentage of women receiving
recommended prenatal care and low
percentage of births attended by trained
medical personnel.
Inefficient health service quality,
regressive distribution of public health
subsidies and insufficient focus on
preventive health services.
Limited access to reproductive health
services, poor birth spacing and high
percentage of child and teen pregnancy.

The prevalence of chronic malnutrition
(stunting) in children under 5 years old
has been reduced.
Baseline: 21.5% (2005)
Target: 15 % (2011)
MDG: 7.0% (2015)

Establishment of a coordinated
approach to combating chronic
malnutrition among children focused
on prevention (2009).

MILESTONES

Economic growth and competitiveness
impeded by high transport costs that in
turn result from the limited provision of
all season roads coupled with inadequate
maintenance.

Government agriculture and
environmental agencies rely
predominantly on external cooperation
which threatens sustainability.
Weak capacity of rural producers to
adjust to a more open trading
environment.
Sustainable rural development
threatened by poor land management
and expansion of agricultural frontier in
or near protected areas.

Increased access to all-season roads –

IV. STRENGTHENING GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY: MODERNIZING AND PROFESSIONALIZING STATE INSTITUTIONS AND PROMOTING CITIZEN PARTICIPATION
Improved civil service
management

Increased public sector
accountability: improved
public sector planning and
financial management; and
increased citizen participation
in social Accountability

Public sector wage policy in the context
of civil service reform should be
transparent, equitable and conducive to
efficiency in public service delivery.

Deficiencies in the planning and
monitoring of public expenditures and
related outcomes increase fiscal
vulnerabilities, reduce efficiency and
constrain effective public sector policies
and service delivery.
Weak institutional capacity in the
external audit institution (CGR) and
internal control undermines public sector
accountability.

The percentage of public sector workers
subject to the Civil Service Law who are
remunerated under an official public
wage policy has increased.
Baseline: 25% (2006)
Target: 70% (2010)
National monitoring and evaluation
system designed and implemented,
strengthening SIGFA, SYSODA and the
M&E systems in Health and Education
ministries (2011).

(including all norms and guidelines
consistent with M&E) is implemented in
all central government entities and key
decentralized agencies (2012).
All public entities certified by CGR for
the use and implementation of the
Technical Norms of Internal Control
according to international standards.
Baseline: 43% (2006)
Target: 100% (2012)

Decentralization

Centralized decision making on local
public investment programs limits both
local government and civil society
participation in the budgetary allocation
processes.

Social accounting mechanisms with civil
society participation are institutionalized
in the Ministries of Education and
Health at a decentralized level (2010).
Increase in percentage of public
investment programs registered in SNIP
which were proposed at municipal level.
Baseline: 30% (2007)
Target: 60% (2012)

A policy on public sector remuneration
has been developed and consensus has
been reached between the National
Assembly and Executive (2008).

M&E system includes mechanism to
monitor and evaluate quality and
gender impact of public expenditure in
Health and Educ. ministries (2010).
Multi-year strategy formulated to
strengthen PFM practices (2008).
Medium term expenditure framework
is used in the decentralized agencies
DGI, INIFOM, FISE and DGA (2010).

ISSUES AND OBSTACLES

The 11% of Nicaraguans living on the
Caribbean Coast, 30% of whom are
indigenous (Miskitos, Mayangnas and
Ramas) and Afrodescendent (Creoles
and Garifunas) face a legacy of
marginalization, poor human
development indicators, and limited
access to infrastructure. Targeted
interventions in these sectors in this
region are necessary.

CAS Completion Report

Country: Nicaragua
Date of CAS: December 18, 2002
Date of ISN: July 6, 2005
Period covered by CAS Evaluation Report: FY03-FY07
INTRODUCTION
1.
This report appraises the World Bank Group’s Nicaragua CAS FY03-05 and
the ISN FY06-07 and has been prepared as an input to the preparation of the new
Country Partnership Strategy FY08-12, due to be presented to the Bank Board in
September 2007. Throughout the document the “CAS period” refers to both the CAS and
ISN periods. The report follows the standard Bank outline: Section A reviews the Long
Term Strategic Goals that were supported by the CAS, discussing their appropriateness,
their linkage to the country’s development strategy, and the advances made during the
CAS period. It should be noted that the strong emphasis on policy lending in the CAS
strategy meant that the development outcomes and policy climate reforms outlined as
Strategic Goals for Nicaragua in the CAS period were also directly adopted as the
planned outcomes of the Bank’s own program.
2.
Section B concentrates on the Bank Program for Nicaragua over FY 03-07,
that is, how the Bank Group’s assistance program hoped to contribute to the
achievement of the long term strategic goals. It discusses whether the outcomes were
well chosen to support the goals, and indicates how different Bank Group’s instruments
(IDA investment lending, AAA work, and the activities of the MIGA and IFC)
contributed towards the outcomes and whether the mix of instruments was appropriate. It
considers other factors that affected the outcomes, such as exogenous shocks, the actions
of other donors, and the performance of the borrower.
3.
Section C reviews the Bank’s performance during the CAS period, focusing
on three themes: (a) the quality of products and services including: the degree to which
project designs were results based; project ratings and the incidence of portfolio problems
according to ISRs and ICRs; and the findings of independent evaluations by QAG and
OED; (b) portfolio performance, including the disbursement ratio, the incidence of
problem projects and the timeliness of delivery of major programmed operations and
AAA; (c) country dialogue and aid coordination: how the Bank contributed to the
development of policy dialogue during the CAS period, including the quality of dialogue
around the CAS itself, and how well the Bank coordinated with other donors. Section D
summarizes the lessons learned from the CAS period, and makes recommendations
for the new CPS. Finally, the report presents recommendations for the new country
partnership strategy.

SECTION A: NICARAGUA’S DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES
AND PROGRESS OF CAS OUTCOMES
4.
The FY03-05 CAS and the FY06-07 ISN were aligned to the first PRSP,
which was later revised and renamed the National Development Plan (NDP) in 2005,
a few months after the Board discussion of the ISN. The NDP 2005-2009 delineates
Nicaragua’s long-term development vision and poverty reduction strategy and more
strongly emphasizes economic growth than the strategy documents that preceded it.
During the CAS period under review, there were changes, though not substantial ones, in
the organization of the GoN’s objectives as expressed in the different PRS/NDP
documents presented to the Bank with respect to pillars, areas, and cross themes. Given
that the CASCR is reporting on two planning periods with two different results matrices,
the report team decided to use the results matrix of the ISN, taken from the National
Development Plan 2005-09, which describes an ambitious agenda of programmed
outcomes which, if met, would result in major advances in the development and poverty
reduction agenda in Nicaragua.
5.
The CAS supported strategic development objectives that were rooted in five
basic areas: (I) Macroeconomic stability, (II) Economic growth for poverty reduction,
(III) Human capital development and social protection, (IV) Productive and social public
infrastructure, and (V) Governance and state reforms. These can be seen in the second
column (NDP 2005-09), Figure 1, on the following page.
6.
The Ortega Administration is currently revising the NDP 05-09 to better
reflect its priorities. The Administration’s main objective is to promote broadly shared
economic growth by creating wealth and reducing poverty. A revised version of the NDP
will be ready by early 2008. Figure 1 presents a comparison of the GoN’s development
objectives throughout the entire CAS period, including the first six months of the
incoming government (following page).
PROGRESS AGAINST CAS OUTCOMES
7.
The CAS period can be divided into two phases: a first phase of rapid advances
(up to HIPC Completion Point in January 2004) and a second phase of growing political
crisis and programmatic delays. The strong emphasis on Poverty Reduction and Support
Credits (PRSCs) during the CAS period meant as mentioned above that most important
CAS outcomes were directly related to the national strategic goals. Advances towards
the goals and outcomes are laid out in the CAS/ISN Matrix (Annex C.1). The following
paragraphs summarize the most important developments.

Overall Goal: Poverty Reduction and Poverty Spending during the CAS Period
8.
The overarching goal of the CAS period was to help the country’s MDG on
cutting extreme poverty in half between 1995 and 2015, which (on a geometrical
projection) implied reaching 13.7 percent rate in 2005. This goal was not achieved.
The latest poverty figures from the 2005 LSMS report an extreme poverty rate of 14.9
percent, composed of a 5.4 percent rate in urban areas and a much higher 26.9 percent
rate in rural areas. Total poverty stood at 46.2 percent (29.1 percent in urban areas and
67.9 percent in rural areas). Importantly, due to insufficient broad-based economic
growth, increases in poverty spending did not translate into significant gains in poverty
reduction (to be discussed in greater detail below). Although movements in the poverty
rate are a long term phenomenon, short-term shocks, such as macroeconomic adjustments
or shifts in key commodity prices such as coffee, have had important impacts on poverty,
especially among vulnerable groups.
9.
Poverty spending targets as outlined in the PRGF framework were met.
Poverty spending increased from 9.6 percent of GDP in 2002 to 13.6 percent of GDP in
2006.
This outcome was initially made possible by directing a substantial share of
the HIPC debt relief towards poverty-reducing programs. But again, increased poverty
spending did not translate into significant gains in poverty reduction. Nonetheless,
reforms to the financial administration system made it possible to track this outcome
using SIGFA, and in-depth Poverty and Social Impact Appraisals (PSIAs) were carried
out on the country’s tax and education reforms. These measures contributed to the
institutionalization of the PRSP process. Nevertheless the government’s systems for
tracking the PRSP/NDP outcomes still require strengthening. To accomplish this
objective, SINASID was put on-line and provides valuable information; however, its
user-friendliness and source documentation need improving.

Area I: Macroeconomic stability
Maintenance of adequate macroeconomic framework: Reduce fiscal deficit to
sustainable level and restore growth: Good progress
10.
The CAS aimed to promote a stable macro-environment through reduction
of the fiscal deficit and to lower the government debt to sustainable levels. These
goals were achieved (see Table 1). From a starting point of 0.8 percent in 2002, annual
GDP growth averaged around 3.2 percent from 2002 to 2006, or 1.3 percent in per capita
terms. Though reasonable by LAC standards, growth was below the average achieved by
other medium-low income countries worldwide. Two tax reforms were passed, which
removed exceptions and increased the efficiency of collection. Spending programs were
also rationalized – while protecting poverty spending – and the fiscal deficit (overall
public sector deficit before grants) fell sharply, from 11.8 percent of GDP in 2001 to 4.19
percent in 2006. Inflation remained under control averaging 7.6 percent since 2001,
although it increased in 2005 to 9.6 percent due to a rise in petroleum prices.
International reserves increased from $US383 million in 2001 to $US896 million in
2006, and since CAFTA-DR (April 2006) exports increased 20 percent. The value of
foreign private investment increased from US$75 million in 1995 to US$230 million in
2005.

Reduction in Public Debt Load: Good Progress
11.
During the CAS period, public debt was reduced from 200 percent of GDP to
70 percent, and Nicaragua exhibits a moderate, but manageable, risk of
experiencing debt distress, provided that sound macroeconomic policies continue to
be applied. This finding emerged from the joint IDA-IMF debt sustainability analysis
carried out in early 2006. The IDB’s decision to participate in the MDRI reduces this
risk further. After all ongoing debt relief initiatives are implemented (i.e., HIPC, MDRI,
commercial debt buy back), Nicaragua’s external debt, in net present value terms (NPV)
is expected to decline to about 35 percent of GDP. However, Nicaragua also has a high
level of domestic debt whose NPV is currently estimated at 19 percent of GDP. This
adds up to a combined public debt of approximately 54 percent of GDP, which is
sustainable if Nicaragua can continue to grow by at least 4 percent per annum, maintain a
primary fiscal surplus near the levels achieved in recent years, and keep various fiscal
pressures in check. Payment on the internal debt, however, represents about 20 percent
of the yearly national budget, which restricts the total available for development
spending.
Financial Sector Reform: Good Progress
12.
Given the 2000-2001 financial crisis, the strengthening of the financial sector
was an important achievement during the CAS period. Following the $450 million
bail-out of depositors in the 2001 crisis that bankrupted four banks, regulations were
greatly improved through supervised audits, and the banking system has been
consolidated at acceptable liquidity ratios. State actions to resolve the crisis were
criticized by certain sectors, especially regarding transparency in the disposition of the
failed banks’ assets, and the fact that the measures taken to resolve the crisis led to an

47

increase of the country’s internal debt. Remaining banks are stable and bank profitability
is among the highest in the region, averaging 37.5 percent for return on equity and 2.2
percent for return on total assets. Intermediation costs are high at 11 percent. Data
suggests that firms continue to rely heavily on retained earnings, and that bank finance
makes up less than 15 percent of working capital for small and medium enterprises
(SMEs) and less than 20 percent of investment finance. High interest rates are a
disincentive for firms to expand and modernize. Consumer lending is the only segment
of the commercial banks’ portfolio that is growing in real terms.
.

Pension Reform: Poor Progress
13.
In pension reform, results have been less successful due to design flaws. In
December 2003, in compliance with HIPC Completion Point conditionality, a pension
reform (Law 340) was passed, introducing individual capitalization accounts to replace
the fiscally unbalanced pay-as-you-go system. In 2004, with tacit agreement of the IMF
and the Bank, implementation was abandoned due to unexpectedly high fiscal costs of the
transition. In early 2005, the focus shifted to containing the fiscal costs of the pension
deficit, and discussions were underway on parametric reforms to the pay-as-you-go
system. The Social Security Fund (INSS) estimates that the situation will become
unsustainable in 2024, giving the government some time to design and seek consensus on
a reform agenda, which will require a significant adjustment in the balance between
employees’ contributions and retirees’ rights, and should avoid regressive subsidies and
support increased coverage of the pensions system.

Area II: Economic growth for poverty reduction
14.
Nicaragua’s annual GDP growth over the last five years has been modest and
highly variable. GDP growth averaged around 3.2 percent per annum from 2002 to
2006, or 1.3 percent in per capita terms. Though reasonable by LAC standards, it is
below the average achieved by other medium-low income countries worldwide.
Nicaragua’s growth was also marked by strong fluctuations, continuing a pattern
observed over the previous decade, and generally reflecting the economy’s vulnerability
to external economic shocks (e.g., commodity price declines and oil price increases),
natural disasters (e.g., El Niño, hurricanes, and earthquakes) and domestic policy
reversals (such as pre-election spending). The modest level and erratic nature of growth
have hampered progress in poverty reduction. Nevertheless, advances in specific CAS
goals continue to provide a supportive environment for investment, growth and future
poverty reduction.

Supportive environment for investment and growth: Good progress
15.
Bank efforts to improve the environment for private sector investment and
growth have been successful. The Bank’s Competitiveness Project was designed to
improve the business environment in Nicaragua and to pilot new business development
services (BDS) through developing sector clusters. Economic growth initiatives were led
by the Presidential Commission on Competitiveness (CPC). Harnessing the experience

48

of MIGA, the Bank built capacity for Pro-Nicaragua, an investment promotion agency
and Nicaexport, an export promotion agency. There were marked improvements in firm
registration and licensing as well as property and land registration (to be discussed
below). The number of days to register a business decreased from 71 to 39 between 2003
and 2006, and the number of steps was halved from 12 to 6.
Promote faster growth through cluster development: Good progress
16.
To support cluster activities, the Bank drew on the extensive experience of the
Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS). The tourism, light manufacturing, dairy,
shrimp, wood products, cattle and coffee clusters all expanded in terms of employment,
sales, and exports. Maquila employment grew from 37,000 to 67,000 between 2000 and
2005. These contributions are reflected in the improved competitiveness ratings of
Nicaragua in international benchmarks including “Doing Business,” where Nicaragua
jumped from 72nd to 67th in the world ranking of 175 countries. The implementation of
business climate reforms and improved road infrastructure will also be key factors to
improve Nicaragua’s competitiveness. For the future, value chains may produce greater
productivity gains than a simple cluster approach.
Modernize the commercial code: Mixed progress
17.
The Commercial Code was not reformed but remains a top priority for the private
sector and the Ministry of the Economy (MIFIC). Steps were taken, however, to improve
the investment climate, including the establishment of investment and export promotion
agencies and the preparation of a law to modernize the mercantile register. A
competition law was passed but still has not been implemented. A reform plan for the
training agency, INATEC, was prepared but is being reviewed by the new administration.
Modernize the cadastre and land registry system, regularize titling and demarcate
and register indigenous territories: Good progress
18.
Progress has been made in land administration reform. Although the
Cadastre law was approved in 2004, the Registry law is still waiting approval in the
National Assembly. This law will make possible the full implementation of the
integrated information system, SIICAR, which serves to link the cadastre and registry
systems. Advances have been made in the design and establishment of the SIICAR, with
over 25% of the properties of Esteli, Chinandega and Madriz integrated into the system.
The project, PRODEP, signed an agreement with the Millennium Challenge account to
expand this work in the Leon and Chinandega area. During the CAS period, the cadastre
system revised 3,326km2 of land of which 2,224km2 were approved, 37,862 parcels were
registered, and 13,223 property documents were processed. A landmark for the period
was the demarcation and titling of five indigenous territories and, to date, the registration
of four, three of which have been registered under the new administration which has
stated its commitment to this process.

49

Improve rural financial services: Good progress
19.
A significant constraint for small farmers is the lack of access to credit. The
CAS proposed to improve this situation through a reform of the microfinance
regulatory framework. The Bank supported the development of a microfinance unit in
the SIBOIF which helped that institution vastly improve its internal capacity to monitor
the industry and to develop the norms necessary for future regulation. In addition, the
Bank supported the capacity of the Financiera Nicaraguense de Inversiones to support
microfinance institutions with technical assistance as well as financial resources. During
the CAS period, more access to financial services has been provided to low income
families and micro and small businesses.
Improve agricultural technology to improve rural productivity: Good progress
20.
Strengthening rural economic development during the CAS period
concentrated on infrastructure, technical assistance, financial services and
ultimately productivity. Agriculture represents about 25 percent of Nicaragua’s gross
national product, and about 50 percent of total exports and 35 percent of employment.
Coffee and sesame seed are export crops. Maize, beans, rice, and sorghum are produced
for internal consumption. Agricultural growth is principally based on area expansion
causing destruction of natural forests. Notwithstanding the recent increasing importance
of agriculture, about 60 percent of rural dwellers live on less than two dollars per day. As
world market prices for traditional crops are increasing, agricultural growth may make a
significant contribution to overall growth. For this to happen in a sustainable way, land
and labor productivity have to increase through technological innovation.
21.
The Bank’s Agriculture Technology project sought to address the needs of small
and medium sized producers by establishing an efficient, demand-driven agriculture
technology, knowledge, and innovation system. Bank support strengthened the
institutional capacity of the two agencies responsible for agricultural growth and product
diversification: MAGFOR and INTA. In coordination with several donors, the Bank was
instrumental in promoting the formation of PRORURAL, a sector-wide initiative for rural
development. A competitive, demand-driven (public/private) fund, FUNICA, was also
established to improve agricultural productivity. Bank supported programs resulted in
significant productivity gains during the CAS period; between 2002 and 2003, the
productivity of corn increased by 37 percent and the productivity of beans by 63 percent.
Nicaragua now meets 85 percent of internal demand for certified seed. In addition, in
2004, the number of farmers receiving technical assistance services increased from 21 to
33.3 percent.

Area III: Human capital development and social protection
Basic Education: Mixed progress
22.
The CAS included targets to increase primary enrollment, improve
promotion rates, reduce inefficiency, and expand the coverage of autonomous

50

schools. Despite confusion over the 2005 census figures, it is generally accepted that the
primary coverage goal was met. According to Education Ministry (MINED) data, net
primary enrollment increased from 81 percent in 2001 to 86 percent in 2006 (as seen in
Table 2 below). However, completion of the primary cycle remains low at 40 percent.
What are more alarming are repetition rates in the first grade, which have been estimated
as high as 30 percent. Pre-primary net and gross enrollment rates have increased,
presently at 52 percent (2006) as well as secondary school net enrollment rates, currently
at 44 percent (2006). Literacy rates among 15-24 year olds also improved from 80
percent in 1993 to 90 percent in 2005 (LSMS). The Bank’s Second Basic Education
project targeted five poor municipalities (Condega, Achuapa, El Sauce, Ciudad Darío and
San Isidro) and focused strongly on the Atlantic Coast Region where 98 percent of the
indigenous people live. In addition to the national level gains mentioned above, 8,328
children in the Atlantic Region gained access to preschool education, and learning
materials were translated into three indigenous languages. The project also supported the
implementation of national assessments in Math and Spanish at the third and sixth grade
levels, which were successfully completed in 2006. Results and analysis are still
pending.

23.
The expansion of the school autonomy regime was supported by CAS sector
operations and Bank budget support. In summary, the program entailed providing
fiscal transfers to schools that left the central government system to be managed locally
by parents and teachers. Through EFA and the Education Project (PASEN), the Bank
supported the expansion of the program by providing technical assistance and financial
incentives. Though coverage goals were met (5,211 schools by 2006), one of the first
actions taken by the Ortega Administration was to suspend the transfers and school
autonomy program and prohibit any charges in public primary and secondary schools.
This measure was received by the public with little opposition and, in fact, public opinion
polls rate the decision to abolish school fees as one of the most important
accomplishments of the administration.16 The government, however, has stated that it
does maintain its commitment to local participation in school management, a concept at
the heart of school autonomy and whose legal status is preserved in the 2003 “Ley de
Participación Educativa.” The Poverty Assessment (2007) confirms the need for more
access and better quality secondary education in order to reduce poverty.
16

It should be noted that part of the transfers were suspended under the previous administration, because
school administrators were not paying their utility bills or social security payments to teachers.

Health and Population: Mixed progress
24.
The strategic goals to reduce infant and child mortality were met. As seen in
Table 3, the maternal mortality rate decreased from 125 per 10,000 births in 2001 to 96 in
2006. The coverage of institutional births improved more slowly from 47 percent in
1999 to 61 percent in 2006. Recent trends in immunization coverage are a source of
concern, as coverage of polio and tuberculosis immunizations have declined since 2002.
Chronic malnutrition amongst 0-5 year olds (stunting or growth retardation due to
chronic malnutrition) decreased by six percentage points between 1998 and 2005, but
remains very high at 21.5 percent. In addition, progress has slowed in recent years, as
most of this gain (5 percentage points) took place between 1998 and 2001, with very little
progress during the first part of this decade (only a 1 percentage point gain between 2001
and 2005).
25.
Progress on strengthening population policy, a strategic goal of the CAS, has
been limited. The CAS supported the incorporation of a reproductive health component
into the standard primary health care model to be promoted through the System of Local
Health Care Centers (SILAIS). It appears that access to reproductive health services
decreased from 25 percent in 2001 to 13 percent in 2006. This may be attributed to the
fact that women are seeking reproductive health services at institutions other than those
included in the SILAIS system (for example, NGOs, given that the percentage of
Nicaragua women using contraceptives has not declined). Teen pregnancy, however,
continues to be a major problem. As planned, management autonomy was increased in
health districts and hospitals: six hospitals established management agreements with the
Ministry of Health, and a new legal and administrative framework was established for
pharmaceuticals administration. The challenge is to turn the institutional changes
achieved in the last few years into changes on the ground in health outcomes for the poor.
There is need for more frequent data on the key issue of nutrition.

Water and Sanitation: Good progress
26.
During the CAS period, a national water and sanitation plan was prepared,
assigning lead responsibility in dispersed rural areas to the Emergency Social
Investment Fund (FISE) and in urban areas to the National Water and Sewage
Company (ENACAL). The national potable water coverage rate improved slightly from
70 percent in 2001 to 72 percent in 2005 (LSMS), well below the 1.4 percent annual
target set in the CAS. In rural dispersed communities, coverage remained constant. The
majority of the population without access to water resides in the Atlantic and Central and
Northern regions of the country. Notably, access to sanitation increased from 86 percent
to 89 percent between 2001 and 2005 (LSMS). Political resistance, limited institutional
capacity and an inconsistent legal framework continue to limit the expansion of water
coverage and the provision of quality service. The Bank’s Water and Sanitation Program
began operations in November 2005. Important contributions of the program include the
promotion of a SWAp process in the sector, the facilitation of knowledge sharing with
other active donor agencies, and the promotion of private participation at the local level
in the management of water and sanitation systems. A stronger emphasis needs to be
placed on coverage in rural areas, particularly in the Atlantic Coast and Central and
Northern regions.
Social Protection: Mixed progress
27.
With Bank support, the Nicaraguan Institute for Municipal Development
and FISE offered municipal programs to reduce the vulnerability of the poor
through increased coverage of basic services. Under FISE, specifically during the ISN
period, 2,047 schools and 311 health centers were reconstructed or rehabilitated. These
Bank supported initiatives were highlighted as good examples of decentralization and
community guided projects, especially on the Atlantic Coast. The CAS also set a goal of
designing and implementing a national social protection strategy to meet the needs of
vulnerable groups. Nicaragua has a variety of programs administered by diverse agencies
to address this issue, but there has been little and inadequate evaluation of the costs and
benefits of alternative designs. In line with the CAS goal, the GoN Social Cabinet
approved a National Social Protection Policy, Solidaridad, in 2005. Under the
coordination of the Ministry of Family (Mifamilia) the policy sought to define the
strategic priorities for developing an effective safety net and to establish the roles and
responsibilities of the relevant agencies. Bank funds were used to finance pilot projects
in five municipalities in 2006 (including a successful pilot for landslide victims). At the
present time, the project team is advising the Ministry of the Family on several
components of its social protection strategy. There are many active donors in this sector,
and coordination needs to improve.

Area IV: Productive and social public infrastructure
Energy: Mixed progress
28.
During the CAS period the situation in the energy sector was complicated.
The privatization of the energy sector did not bring about the desired outcomes. The

53

contentious relationship between the government and the distribution company, Union
Fenosa, has been a major political issue, although the new administration is now in
discussions with the transnational. There continues to be an unreliable supply of energy
due to generation constraints (including obsolescence of current infrastructure and lack of
new investment) as well as elevated costs due to high dependency on thermal (i.e., oilfired) generating plants. To attract private investment in the sector, the government will
need to implement confidence building measures and provide better legal clarity.
Although the current administration has sought short term solutions by importing small
diesel generating plants, medium and long term solutions are still pending. In FY07, the
Bank prepared an Energy Policy Note, which has been presented to the new
administration.
29.
Access and expansion of rural electrification require more effort.
Nicaragua’s 69 percent electrification rate is the lowest in the Central American region,
and electrification is considerably lower in rural areas at only 34 percent. Bank support
has been important in assisting the government in piloting innovative methodologies of
service delivery using renewable energy sources. During the CAS period, 1,717 rural
homes in el Bote, Francia Sirpe and La Union were provided with electricity. In addition,
1,482 credits totaling $1.5 million were provided to rural electrified zones. Strengthening
rural infrastructure, particularly in the energy sector, is essential for future growth and
private investment.
Telecommunications: Good progress
30.
Privatization of the National Telecommunications Company (ENITEL) and
the creation of the regulatory entity TELCOR have boosted investment. New
cellular licenses were granted in 2001 and 2003. Services have improved with IDA
support; national coverage of fixed and mobile phones increased sevenfold from 194,000
to more than 1.3 million in 2005, and mobile phone coverage in the provincial capitals
increased from 50 percent in 1999 to 100 percent in 2003. However, despite these large
increases in fixed and mobile telephone usage, Nicaragua still has the lowest penetration
rates in Latin America: 23.6 per 100 people. Moreover, despite the Telecommunications
Investment Fund (FITEL), which tries to improve access in rural areas by offering
subsidies where private operators are reluctant to operate, there continues to be a
dramatic disparity in access to telecommunications and ICT infrastructure between urban
and rural areas. Urban centers, such as Managua, have 12.7 fixed phones per 100
inhabitants compared to less than 0.4 fixed phones in rural areas where more than 48
percent of the population lives. More access needs to be provided to rural areas. The
second Bank Telecommunications operation, approved during the CAS period, will be
addressing these issues.
Transportation: Good progress
31.
To more efficiently connect people to markets and social services, CAS
targets were set to improve the road network. The Road Transport II project was
restructured after Hurricane Mitch and became a vital tool for rapidly restoring access,
54

resuming agriculture production and other economic activities, and generating short term
employment through public works. The goal of paving 300 km of rural roads was
accomplished using a labor-intensive, cost effective, local technology called adoquines.
The Bank project also reconstructed major roads and important trade routes, including
parts of the Pan American Highway from Muhan to El Rama (90.3 km) and from
Managua to Izapa, Leon (62 km). To improve road maintenance, the Bank supported the
development of a model of 33 micro-enterprises responsible for 2,080 km of the paved
network, employing over 350 people under Transport III. Unfortunately, Nicaragua’s
roads remain the poorest in the Central American region, with only 20 percent in good or
fair condition. According to the LSMS, a little more than one-fifth (22.3 percent) of all
Nicaraguan households have access to paved roads (access is 7 percent among the
extreme poor, 11 percent among the poor, and 30 percent among the non-poor). In order
to adequately compete under CAFTA-DR, the paved and secondary road network
requires improvement.

Area V: Governance and state reforms
Establishing a civil service: Mixed progress
32.
Though the new civil service law was passed during the CAS period, progress
has been slow due to high fiscal costs. The Bank’s Economic Management Technical
Assistance loan laid important groundwork, including the creation of a supervisory
agency, the evaluation of public sector personnel and the development of new post
descriptions. In 2005, the GoN initiated the accreditation and incorporation of public
servants into a permanent administrative career regime, and by the end of 2006 over
4,000 employees from 18 institutions were incorporated. Rapid turnover of public sector
employees is highly problematic. However, though there were changes in staff in
January 2007, changes have been on a smaller scale than experienced in previous
administrations. The problem of overdependence on highly paid consultants, many in
line positions including higher management and financed by the donor community,
continued to be a serious problem under the Bolaños administration, but has been tackled
early on by the new administration.
Improve transparency in the use of public resources and improve public
expenditure planning and management: Good progress
33.
The Bank helped to enhance Nicaragua’s public financial management
systems and modernize the legal framework for the financial sector, which led to
greater fiscal transparency. This assistance, channeled through the Country Financial
Accountability Assessment, Country Procurement Assessment Report, and the Technical
Assistance Credit operation, coupled with policy support through the PRSCs, improved
the operation of internal controls and external scrutiny and analysis of fiscal performance,
which has improved government accountability and the efficiency and impact of public
expenditure. The programming of public investment was strengthened by a presidential
decree consolidating all programs into the National Public Investment System (Sistema
Nacional de Inversion Pública, SNIP). The SIGFA system for public sector financial
administration continued to be consolidated and a single treasury account was established
to channel all internal public revenues. A major step forward was the enactment in 2005
55

of the Financial Management and Budget Regime Law (Law 550), which set strict limits
on budget modifications and brought almost all donor assistance within the budgetary
framework.
34.
The Bank also engaged in work with Nicaragua’s civil society on a series of
issues, of which the most important was support for the construction of a civil
society agenda in governance. Trust funds were obtained to support work on social
auditing of public policies and basic services, especially health and education at the
municipal level. Another trust fund supported the work of a “Grupo Promoter,” which
promoted the design of a Public Access to Information Law that was passed in the first
months of the Ortega administration.
Implement a program of judicial reform: Mixed progress
35.
The strategic goal of the CAS in this area included institutional strengthening of
the judiciary and modernization of the penal code and criminal process code. Some
progress was made despite perceived politicization of the judicial system. The criminal
process code was updated and progress was made on the modernization of the over 100
year old penal code, though final approval by the National Assembly is pending. The
Law for Judicial Careers, which when effective will professionalize the process of
selecting judges at all levels of the judicial system, was passed, but its statues have yet to
be elaborated, although preliminary steps have been taken to prepare for implementation
of the new law. This is a major concern of the Budget Support Group. Other advances
seen over the CAS period include the implementation of a program of judicial facilitators
in rural areas (43 percent of rural areas now have this alternative system). 72
municipalities now also have the capacity to offer complete judicial coverage; in other
words, they have a judge, a district attorney and a public defender. Finally, over five
special youth courts were established in response to the demands of the Children’s Legal
Code.
Institutionalize the PRSP process: Good progress
36.
During the CAS period, the PRSP I and its successor, the NDP, remained the
central instruments for the policy planning process, reinforced by the role of the Bank’s
budget support operations. Three progress reports were prepared. Poverty spending
definitions were strengthened and targets were met under the PRGF program. The
National System of Development Indicators (SINASID) was established and several
PSIA studies were carried out. The existence of a satisfactory national poverty reduction
strategy document has been and will continue to be necessary condition and will serve
not only as a framework for national development efforts but also for donor coordination,
especially budget support. The efforts, however, to design a national strategy with
political consensus from most sectors of Nicaraguan society has been painfully slow. It
is encouraging to note that the new administration has decided not to do a new National
Development Plan; rather, it is producing a shorter term document within the longer term
framework of the NDP to better reflect administration priorities for the next five years.
The challenge will be to find national consensus. Another challenge on a technical level
is the need to support the strengthening of planning capabilities at national and sector

56

levels and to provide a basis for more effective donor coordination to meet NDP goals.
Support for the timely generation of data for tracking NDP outcomes and goals and the
continued improvement of the tracking system, SINASID, are also required.

Cross Cutting Themes
Environment and ecological vulnerability: Good progress
37.
New legislation on biodiversity, water resources, fisheries, and forestry was
approved and implemented. The forest law marks a major shift in the legislative
framework of the sector, reforming institutional roles and setting up appropriate
incentives (e.g., giving ownership of trees to the owners of land and offering fiscal
incentives to forestation and reforestation) and regulations (through a system of regents
supervised by the forest institute, INAFOR). The major achievements of the GEFfinanced Atlantic Biological Corridor (ABC) project were its legislative, institutional,
capacity building, and cultural innovations, which created an enabling base to ensure the
conservation and sustainable use of biological resources in this area. The recently
initiated “Corazon” project is a follow-up to the ABC, given that, as pointed out by the
OED ICR review of ABC, the establishment of a biodiversity conservation program
requires a long-term program approach.
38.
The Bank successfully supported risk management and emergency
preparedness through the expansion of the National Plan for Risk Management.
The Natural Disasters Vulnerability project experienced significant delays in project
implementation in its first years, but a change in top management was the key to
achieving principal project outcomes, especially in the areas of risk prevention programs
on a municipal level with Civil Defense, and the completion of important mitigation
projects again at the municipal level, implemented in coordination with FISE.
Social Equity: Good progress
39.
Bank work in gender and in other social equity areas increased over the last
five years. The Bank has continued efforts to promote the economic empowerment of
women not only though coordination with the donor community’s active Gender Group,
but also through specific operations, including the Social Investment Fund (FISE), the
Agricultural Technology project (PTAII), and the Land Administration project
(PRODEP). Each of these projects incorporated gender aspects in its design and
addressed gender issues during its implementation to achieve fairness and equity,
particularly in the processes of land titling and registration. For example, in the majority
of cases, titling is now done under the names of both the man and his spouse. Some
advances have been made in improving coverage and quality of health services for
women at childbearing age, including through Casas Maternas, a component of the
Bank’s Health Sector Reform Project that was selected as a regional best practice by the
LAC gender department because of its effect in reducing maternal mortality. An
evaluation of this component is underway.

57

40.
Nevertheless, social, cultural and legal factors hinder Nicaraguan women in
achieving their economic development potential by limiting their access to, inter alia,
assistance, opportunities, markets, land, and financial and technical resources.
However, more women than men participate in microfinance borrowing. In urban and
rural areas respectively, women represent 55 percent and 52 percent of micro-credit
clients, but they receive a smaller percentage of overall funds: available funds are
“micro” with respect to their economic potential. With respect to land titling, there is still
little legal recognition of common-law unions, which has presented problems when
jointly registering titles. Women remain in a vicious circle of indebtedness, low
productivity, low revenues, and little capacity for productive reinvestment, thus facing
inequality in rights, resources and overall voice in the economy and in society.
41.
These issues have been and continue to be addressed by the Bank during the
present CAS formulation. A series of gender focused studies, funded by different trust
funds as well as the regular Bank budget, are being prepared in coordination with IDB to
better inform the implementation of current and future operations. DFID funding
facilitated the contracting of a gender specialist to participate in the CAS process, and
specific workshops have been held to review the results of gender mainstreaming efforts
in Bank operations, as well as to inform INIM, donors and other groups about the Bank’s
new Gender Action Plan, which focuses on women’s economic empowerment. Study
results and trust funds will be used to design and fund four different pilot-level projects
that combine conditional cash transfers with the work of gender focused microfinance
organizations. A rigorous impact evaluation will monitor economic and social results.
Decentralization: Good progress
42.
Good advances were made in municipal strengthening, supported by INIFOM and
FISE, which began to coordinate their efforts. The Rural Municipal Development project
sought to build the capacity of rural municipalities in delivery of municipal services,
sustainable management of natural resources, and promotion of local economic
development. Municipal revenue generation averaged 22.4 percent in 2003-4.
Decentralized local mechanisms at the territorial level are being used to resolve
environmental conflicts, replacing a rigid centralized scheme of conflict resolution.
Decentralized citizen participation organizations, the Departmental Development
Committees, have the responsibility to develop municipal investment plans, and, as of
2006, 32 percent of public investments registered in the SNIP come from this source.
FISE supported the execution of over 2,600 small scale projects benefiting over 3.7
million people in all 153 municipalities of the country. The number of municipalities
actually managing their own project cycle increased from nine (baseline) to 109 at the
end of the project – about twice the expected target.
43.
The previous administration, at the end of its mandate, also finalized a National
Policy and Strategy for Decentralization that is now being revised by the new
administration. The National Assembly approved a law that gradually increases transfers
to municipal governments from 6 percent in 2005 to 10 percent in 2010. The increased
transfers, however, have not been linked to a corresponding transfer of responsibilities for

58

service provision, creating a problem of un-mandated funding (the inverse of the classic
fiscal problem of the unfunded mandate). Strengthening municipal governments will be
a key theme for Nicaragua’s development for the foreseeable future. But the
sustainability of increased fiscal transfers to municipalities requires that service provision
mandates be transferred too. The process should also take account of differences in local
government capacity, and avoid undermining key sector goals by disturbing working
institutional arrangements in health and education.

SECTION B: BANK PROGRAM NICARAGUA FY 2003-2007
44.
This section details the support given by the Bank Group to the advances
achieved during the CAS period. It starts with a description of the programmed and
actual IDA lending commitments and the role of other instruments – such as AAA
activities, and products by the WBI, IFC and MIGA activities – that were envisioned
under the CAS framework. It then discusses whether the choice of instruments was
appropriate and considers their fit with the overall goals laid out in the CAS Matrix,
taking account of the activities of other donors, borrower performance, and exogenous
shocks.
IDA Lending
45.
Table 4 (next page) details the planned and realized program of IDA lending
commitments over FY03-07. The lending commitments approved during this period
totaled $US 274.5 million. All operations programmed in the two strategy documents
were prepared and approved by the Board, with the exception of the Health APL 3, which
was programmed for FY07 but postponed to the next CAS period per request of President
Bolaños (to increase the amount available for Transport IV). The IDA resource envelope
for FY03-05 was initially set at $120.5 million for the Base Case with an additional $39
million in the High Case. An additional $45 million was made available under the IDA
amplification in early 2004, which was added to the Base Case, resulting in increases for
the PRSC I operation ($35 million - which was divided into two tranches) and in the
allotments for Basic Education III and the Public Sector TAC. There were, however,
some important delays: Rural electrification was moved to FY04, and the rural
microfinance, basic education and health projects were not approved until FY05.
46.
Of the total allocated for FY 03-07, 48.6 percent was to programmatic lending,
including support to the TA credit, consistent with the priority that both strategies gave to
policy lending, provided through PSAC I and PRSC I and II. The 2002 CAS also
proposed small investment operations to test innovative approaches to poverty reduction
for possible expansion in the future, in rural microfinance, rural electrification,
competitiveness, basic education and health and nutrition. The most recent project of the
CAS period in review, Competitiveness II for $17 million, was approved by the Board in
August of 2006, but still has not been signed by the new administration.

IDA non lending services: trust funds
47.
The Bank’s portfolio during the CAS period also included Trust Funds and
Regional Projects. At least 15 trust funds were active during the CAS period and
represented approximately $45 million, supporting every sector to which the Bank
offered assistance. Trust funds included: Education-For-All Fast Track Initiative
(EFA/FTI), PHRD grants, one JSDF, two GEF grants, as well as other small grants
supporting the work of civil society. In addition, Nicaragua was beneficiary of several
regional projects of which the largest is the Central America HIV/AIDS project.
IDA non lending services: analytical work
48.
As would be expected in a CAS which places a high importance on
programmatic lending, the non lending services for both planning periods included
an ample program of studies to inform the policy process. Cross-sector AAA work
planned for the CAS period included two Public Expenditure Reviews; Joint Staff
Assessments of the PRSP and PRSP Progress Reports; a Poverty Assessment and Update;
a Country Economic Memorandum; PSIA studies of PRSP impacts; and an Institutional
and Governance Review. Planned sector-level studies included CFAA and CPAR
studies; work on agricultural growth, rural competitiveness, and land policy; studies of
youth at risk and informal safety nets; an ex-post evaluation of the FISE; an education
sector policy note; studies of off-grid electricity and renewable energy; an FSAP study of
the financial sector; an investment climate assessment; and an infrastructure assessment.
Other sector-level studies included Support for the Administration of Justice in
60

Nicaragua, a Decentralization Policy Note, several gender studies, and several other
policy notes now being used in policy dialogue with the new government (Annex C.6
provides a list of non-lending analytical services delivered during the last five fiscal
years).
49.
Many studies made important contributions to policy dialogue. Particularly
noteworthy were the activities in support of HIPC completion point. The relevance and
quality of AAA work during the CAS period was generally high. However, the quality
and impact tended to be higher in the cross sector studies, such as the Public Expenditure
Review, and in the standard Bank products at sector level, such as the CFAA.
Dissemination of studies remains an issue. In respect to the PSIAs, it has been argued by
civil society that greater efforts are needed to not only improve dissemination of final
products in Spanish, but also share drafts in order to stimulate debate. During preparation
of the FY08-12 CAS, the Bank team with SETEC organized a series of thematic
workshops at which some of the analytic studies were disseminated and informal policy
notes requested by the government were discussed.
50.
More information has been made available and disseminated through the
Development Information Center (CID). The center, which opened in October 2003,
was an initiative of the World Bank and other donors including the UN, DFID, CIDA,
IDB, and Nicaragua’s Central Bank. In October 2006, another CID was inaugurated in
the city of Matagalpa. The CID maintains a useful virtual library containing donor
studies and evaluations. Similarly, through hosting various events, the Global
Development Learning Network has also played an important role in knowledge sharing
over the past several years.
IFC and MIGA support during the CAS period
51.
IFC’s approach outlined in the December 2002 joint CAS was updated by the July
2005 joint ISN. IFC sought both regional projects and country-specific support
opportunities for Nicaragua, focusing on: increased access to finance, particularly for
MSMEs; competitive companies in agriculture, industry and service; south-south
investments; and helping to improve infrastructure. IFC’s work during the ISN period
centered primarily on supporting underserved segments, including the MSME sector,
small-scale farmers, and lower-income population. First, IFC has made considerable
progress in engaging with municipalities in simplifying business regulations to help
improve the investment climate in Nicaragua. With a focus on those regulations blocking
MSME growth, IFC has been working in Leon, Masaya, Managua, Granada, Chinandega,
Rivas, Matagalpa, and San Juan del Sur. For example, as a result of reform in Leon, the
requirements to open a business were cut from nine steps to three (for simple firms that
do not need inspections) while the required time was reduced from eighteen days to two
days.
Ten municipalities were included in the Municipal Scorecard 2007, a
benchmarking tool that provides comparative information on the quality and efficiency of
municipal-level private sector regulation, to strengthen social accountability. Second,
IFC has been assisting with improving the legal framework for leasing, often the only
feasible avenue for many MSMEs to finance their equipment purchases. The bill, which
has the support of all political parties, is in the process of being submitted to the National

61

Assembly. Once the law is submitted, institution-building support is planned for banks
and leasing companies, tax authorities and judges to ensure the success of the reform.
Institution-building support will be complemented by a public education campaign, to
highlight the benefits of leasing as a financial instrument for MSMEs.
52.
Third, IFC’s US$5 million investment in a leading microfinance institution,
committed in FY07, is helping to expand available credit for micro-entrepreneurs. The
financing is complemented by a technical assistance project, which is aimed at
strengthening the microfinance institution’s institutional capacity to manage rapid
growth. In addition, IFC has recently approved a US$20 million investment and
technical assistance package to support a local bank to provide finance to MSMEs and
homeowners in the lower-income population. Fourth, IFC invested in three firms that
would help increase opportunities for local producers and vendors, linking companies’
Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives to core business operations: (i) a leading sugar
exporter, for which IFC provided US$36.5 million financing (including US$11.5 million
for syndications) for its upgrading and expansion, is also being considered for IFC’s
advisory support to promote MSME supply chain linkages between the sugar mill and
surrounding communities; (ii) IFC provided US$25 million in a regional project for an
international agricultural commodities company to establish a capital lending program to
improve the production practices of small-holder coffee suppliers in Central America; to
date, IFC has helped Nicaraguan coffee producers obtain about US$5 million for thirteen
investment projects related to meeting certification standards. This project was
complemented by another IFC advisory project that is helping 1,500 coffee farmers in
Nicaragua to achieve certification, sell to large multinational buyers and significantly
increase their income; and (iii) with a US$35 million regional investment (including
US$10 million for the retail sector in Nicaragua), IFC is supporting an established group
with multi-sector operations in Central America in providing training to foster their
MSME tenants, and the training is planned for its tenants in Nicaragua. In addition to the
above regional project, IFC provided on a regional scale a total of US$50 million to the
leading automotive and agribusiness finance companies to promote their lending to
SMEs.
53.
IFC’s engagement in Nicaragua has increased considerably during the last few
years and the outlook for further expansion looks promising. During the ISN period
(FY06-07), IFC’s overall investment support for Nicaragua totaled US$51.5 million,
including US$11.5 million mobilized from an international bank via syndications
(excluding regional projects that benefit Nicaragua). IFC’s portfolio (on the committed
basis) has grown from US$6.3 million as of end FY03 to US$52.6 million (including
US$11.5 million for Participants’ account) at the end of FY07. In addition, IFC’s
advisory services stand at about US$5 million to date, and those linked to its investments
have increased to around 50 percent, which is high compared to other countries in the
region. The co-location of IFC’s advisory services staff in the Bank’s Country Office in
Managua provides an ideal arrangement to leverage Bank-IFC synergies in the next CPS
period.

In cooperation with the IDA-funded Competitiveness LIL, MIGA supported
the development of the export promotion agency ProNicaragua, which is considered a
model for the region and has played a direct role in attracting $150 million in new
investment and approximately 12,000 new jobs during the CAS period. MIGA has a
strong presence in Nicaragua, which is one of its top 20 host countries. Among the
guarantees presently in place are those for a large geothermal energy plant and for a
national electricity distribution concession. As mentioned earlier, the sector is an
increasing concern, and in order for it to improve requires outside investors and higher
levels of investor confidence. MIGA also supported an agricultural equipment leasing
company.

Appropriateness of chosen outcomes to support Nicaragua’s strategic goals
55.
As noted in the introduction to this report, the large emphasis placed on
budget support operations in the CAS period under review means that the most
important CAS outcomes were directly related to the national strategic goals, as
discussed in Section A. The budget support operations supported a broad range of
policy actions which were fully consistent with the CAS Matrix and whose
implementation would likely contribute in important ways to the medium term goals of
the PRSP/NDP. In addition, the CAS supported innovative pilot lending operations in
key areas linked to PRSP/NDP goals, such as rural public services (i.e., education, health
and nutrition) and infrastructure access (i.e., telecom, electricity and water and
sanitation), where the use of publicly mandated investment funds will play an important
role for the foreseeable future. Short-term results in these sectors, however, have been
mixed. Innovative operations tied to policy reform and supported by both budget support
and investment operations did not always have national ownership, and suffered not only
from changes in government, but also ministers within the previous administration (case
in point: the School Autonomy program). In these areas, the crystallization of strategies
to improve the quality and effectiveness of investments should be supported by a national
political consensus from both political actors and civil society.
Appropriateness of chosen instruments and triggers to support the CAS outcomes
56.
Given the overall country context, the country team judges that the lending
and non-lending instruments laid out in the CAS program were broadly
appropriate to supporting the CAS’s planned outcomes and related development
goals. The fact that the base and excellent cases were largely implemented as planned
confirms the appropriateness of the program’s design to the country context.
57.
The portfolio inherited from the previous CAS included 15 ongoing
investment projects with considerable amounts un-disbursed, and many projects
were already delayed due to the difficulty of working in Nicaragua in the final years
of the Alemán administration. This made it sensible to avoid setting up many new
investment operations. A further consideration was the difficult fiscal situation, which
made it likely that investment operations would face counterpart funding constraints.17
Also the HIPC Completion process placed a strong emphasis on the policy reform agenda
rather than on the need for specific investments.
58.
These factors made it appropriate to concentrate the lending portfolio on
programmatic lending, geared to supporting the PRSP and HIPC effort, limiting
new investment operations to small pilot projects that explored new approaches to
meeting key PRSP/NDP goals, such as access to rural infrastructure, education and
nutrition. The Bank’s budget support operations, especially PRSC I and the supporting
AAA work, proved decisively important in supporting Nicaragua through the HIPC
Completion process, engendering one of the most dynamic periods of policy
improvement seen in Nicaragua in recent years. As noted above, there was some loss of

has now been eliminated.

64

momentum in 2004; nevertheless, the advances in macroeconomic and structural reforms
achieved in 2002-2003 remain intact, and actually improved in the later years of the CAS
period. At the same time, Bank task managers were able to concentrate on improving the
performance of pre-existing investment operations, instead of preparing new loans, and
portfolio performance improved correspondingly.
59.
However, inevitably, the strong emphasis on budget support policy lending
also exposed the program to political uncertainties, which are the most important
exogenous factor affecting the Nicaragua program. It also made the advance of the
program highly dependent on borrower performance in a country where the quality of the
public administration and the lack of political consensus between the Executive and the
National Assembly on implementing difficult policy reforms meant that budget support
lending was likely to be very difficult. Despite the loss of momentum in 2004, the
second tranche of PRSC I was disbursed in FY06 as was PRSC 2 in FY07; both
testament to the ability of Nicaragua to achieve political consensus when least expected.
During the design of the new CPS, the Ortega administration made it clear that future
prior actions should not be related to constitutional issues (earmarked budgeting, for
example) or laws that need approval by the National Assembly. Nevertheless, the initial
program proposal to the IMF, which forms part of the negotiations for a new PRGF
agreement with the Fund, does include a policy reform agenda.

SECTION C: MEASURING BANK PERFORMANCE
60.
This section of the report looks at the quality of Bank group products and
services, including linkages to results influenced by project designs, project ratings (both
in-house and from QAG and OED), and the incidence of portfolio problems. It also
discusses portfolio performance, looking at the disbursement ratio, the incidence of
problem projects and the timeliness of deliverables. Finally, it reviews issues
surrounding country dialogue and donor coordination.
61.
At the beginning of the CAS period, as mentioned above, there was strong
momentum in the policy reform process. At the same time, the Bank greatly
strengthened its in-country presence, improving its capacity to resolve problems with
project implementation and to play a leadership role in policy dialogue. The Managua
Office now houses a team of nine senior professionals, including the country manager, an
economist, specialists in operations/human development, public sector management (cofinanced by four donors), and the private sector (seconded by DFID), as well as ESD,
water and sanitation, procurement and financial management experts. These two factors
came together to permit a sharp increase in disbursements of both budget support and
traditional investment loans.

65

Disbursements
62.
Disbursement performance was generally strong over the last five years.
With an average disbursement ratio of 32.0 during FY02-07, Nicaragua has shown
disbursement rates higher than those of other Central American countries (see Table 7 –
Selected Indicators of Bank Portfolio Performance and Management). Initially, the major
budgetary support operations, PSAC I and the first tranche of the PRSC I, disbursed
quickly, and renewed momentum was achieved in several projects that had run into
problems towards the end of the Alemán administration. However, in FY07,
disbursements slowed due to the effects of Law 550 and a change in government.
The quality of products and services
63.
The quality of the Nicaragua portfolio (see Annex C.2), as measured by OED and
QAG reviews, and by in-house evaluations, is generally satisfactory. In the CAS period
under review, 15 projects were subject to OED IEG/ICR review, and only one has been
rated Unsatisfactory: the Pension and Financial Reform Technical Assistance Credit.
One project – Transport II – was rated Highly Satisfactory, nine, Satisfactory, and four
Moderately Satisfactory. A 2003 QAG Quality at Entry review of the first PBL operation
under the present CAS, PSAC I, was critical of aspects of the macroeconomic strategy
being supported, and rated the project Moderately Satisfactory. However, the country
team strongly disagreed with the review team’s judgment. The successful
macroeconomic outcomes over the last two years would seem to bear out the country
team’s point of view on this matter. A subsequent QAG review rated PRSC I as highly
satisfactory.
64.
Portfolio quality has been improving over the CAS period. According to the CAS
2003-2005 Interim Completion Report, then available in-house criteria on the status of
the portfolio showed all projects to be classified as either Satisfactory or Highly
Satisfactory under ICR and OED reviews, except for the Pension and Financial Market
(which was classified as Unsatisfactory for both) and Sustainable Forestry and NI FISE
III, which were reported as Moderately Satisfactory under their OED reviews. Overall,
only two projects, Land Administration and PRSC I, were judged “at risk,” but five of the
16 active projects had risk flags: the Second Rural Municipal Development project and
the Natural Disaster project (slow disbursement); the Telecom Reform project (M&E,
financial management and counterpart funding); the Financial Services project
(effectiveness delay) and the PRSC 1 operation (project management). During the ISN
period, the portfolio continued to improve, but as a result of a financial management
supervision mission covering the entire portfolio undertaken from March 12 to 24, 2007,
several projects were downgraded in their Implementation Objectives. The current
portfolio, according to ISR ratings, has no Unsatisfactory or Moderately Unsatisfactory
ratings with respect to Development Objectives, but two projects, Competitiveness and
Land Administration, are rated Moderately Unsatisfactory with respect to Implementation
Progress; the former for effectiveness delay, and the latter attributable to the results of the
FM review.

66

65.
According to the Financial Management team, there have been bottlenecks in
the financial management side of operations in the Nicaraguan portfolio.
Compliance with financial and auditing requirements has been uneven, although the
quality of audit and procurement reports, once received, is generally satisfactory. Two
areas which require attention are the monitoring and registering of special accounts.
Program disbursements, financial compliance and project implementation have also been
adversely affected by the replacement of personnel owing to changes in the
Administration and among ministers in the previous administration.
Financial
procurement and disbursement trainings for the government will need to be
institutionalized in the next period to follow-up an initial training held in June 2007 that
began to address the results of the FM review.

Country dialogue and aid coordination
66.
Donor coordination was considerably strengthened during the CAS period.
Nicaragua remains highly dependent on aid – nearly 30 percent of its budget comes from
ODA. The Bank was the second largest donor during the FY02-07 period contributing
$434 million, and continues to be recognized by other donors for its high quality analytic
work, setting fiduciary and safeguard standards and for serving in a catalytic role in
promoting the use of SWAps. Leadership in key policy dialogue has also been
recognized, and energetic country dialogue and improved donor coordination were
important facets of CAS implementation. PRSC operations placed policy dialogue at the
center of the Bank’s activities. Nicaragua continued to play a leading role internationally
in the movement to organize donor support around national poverty reduction programs,
harmonize donor practices (e.g., on M&E frameworks, joint studies, and shared policy
conditionality), and channel, as much as possible, donor assistance through budgetary
support or pooled funding.

67

67.
The Bank has played a leading role in establishing and nurturing the Budget
Support Group (BSG), contributing $91.4 million between 2004 and 2007. Besides the
World Bank, BSG members include the Netherlands, the European Union, Sweden,
Switzerland, Germany, Finland, Norway and Great Britain. The largest active donor in
Nicaragua, the IDB, signed up to the BSG and has recently been supportive of
harmonization and alignment initiatives. In May 2005, the Bank and members of the
donor community signed a Joint-Financing Arrangement (JFA), which was designed to
support the government in effectively implementing policies and upgrading institutions.
The JFA’s Performance Assessment Matrix (PAM) facilitates the monitoring and
evaluation of the Government’s policy and actions. Nevertheless, more work is needed
to streamline the PAM, and a joint commission between government and cooperation will
be working on this in FY08.
68.
Another noteworthy advance in donor coordination was the development of the
EFA fast track initiative in the education sector, supported by the Bank and various
important donors. A common work plan was agreed for 2004-2006 for donor support to
the sector, within a results-based framework. Currently, the Bank is involved in sector
wide approaches in education, health, and agriculture development. Working groups
(mesas sectoriales) have also been established to coordinate donor assistance in most
sectors, and their importance has also been noted by the new administration.
69.
The FY08-12 CPS has been prepared through a broad participatory process
involving representatives of a wide range of government and non-government
organizations as well as various sectors of society. The consultations in the territories
were implemented using a workshop format: presentations were made by the GoN and
the WB and time was allocated for questions, comments and responses. A similar format
was used for the consultations held in Managua with civil society, the private sector,
active donors, and the Government; during these consultations, recently completed
analytic work (the PER and the PA) was presented. Technical workshops were held on
the following thematic areas: rural financial services, access to land, energy sector,
transportation sector, gender, and nutrition. Each technical workshop varied in design
and facilitation; however, as with all consultations, each relied on inputs from the
government in creating the agenda and inviting participants.
70.
Findings from the territorial consultations include: (i) the importance of
micro and small farmers and businesses having adequate access to credit with low
interest rates; (ii) the need to strengthen citizen participation and social auditing
opportunities; (iii) the desire to have decentralization processes better articulated from the
local level to the national level; (iv) the urgency and concern for reform of land titling
processes; and (v) the value in investing in infrastructure development to facilitate the
country’s economic and social development. In addition, suggestions from the work
groups (civil society/private sector) included: (i) in social development, attention
should be focused on policies favoring the advancement of women and youth, as well as
reevaluation of the role of the market in poverty reduction; (ii) concerning governance,
government actors need to be held accountable around the tenets of legality,
transparency, and legitimacy, and the law for citizen participation and access to public

68

information needs to be upheld; and (iii) pertaining to economic development, health,
education and infrastructure and increasing dialogue are required to maintain economic
growth.
SECTION D: LESSONS LEARNED & KEY CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE FY08-12 CAS
71.
This section presents the principal conclusions and lessons learned from the CAS
period, and recommendations for the new CPS. Annex C.4 provides an overview of the
Bank’s contributions to Nicaragua’s advances under the CAS. Advances are ranked as
positive, mixed, or poor. Bank contributions are ranked very important, important or not
important.
72.
The lending strategy and non-lending instruments in the CAS/ISN programs
were broadly appropriate and proved effective in supporting the planned outcomes.
The Bank’s budget support operations and the supporting AAA work proved of decisive
importance in supporting Nicaragua through the HIPC Completion process. Portfolio
performance improved because Bank task managers were able to concentrate on
improving the performance of pre-exiting investment operations instead of preparing new
loans. However, the strong emphasis on policy based lending also exposed the program
to political uncertainties, the most important exogenous factor affecting the Nicaragua
program. Program advancements remained highly dependent on borrower performance,
which is typically a risk in countries where the quality of the public administration
remains uncertain. Nevertheless, the country’s development agenda advanced during the
last five years and laid the basis for even more advancement in the next five years. Better
harmonization of aid and less dispersion of projects, expanded economic relationships
with new partners, the reactivation of rural production, SME development to create jobs,
and more efficient and targeted social programs will be important elements in
Nicaragua’s evolving poverty reduction strategy.
73.
Budget support to promote further and deeper institutional reforms will continue
to be crucial and the new government has signaled its desire for continued budget support
from the Bank in the new CPS period. National ownership of those reforms is a
necessary condition as it has been evident throughout the period under review that
institutional reforms can only be successful with political consensus and unwavering
government commitment, at all levels, for a sustained period of time. Operations
must have buy-in not only from high level Ministry officials but also from mid-level
management: i.e., the people who will be implementing on the ground. In addition,
project design should better reflect existing institutional capacity within government and
include capacity strengthening components, instead of relying on quick fixes such as
PIUs.
74.
The Bank should continue to provide a series of budget support operations
within the BSG framework to constructively engage the government on key policy
reforms. The new administration has stated that they will not accept reforms with prior
conditions of new laws. In addition, the Bank should undertake up to five or six new
investment operations in areas where the Bank has comparative advantages, together with

69

a well coordinated package of AAA services. The government has confirmed its interest
in new investment credits in water and sanitation, roads, land administration, and public
sector management.
75.
Over the last five years the Bank has greatly strengthened its in-country
presence. It has improved its capacity to resolve problems in project implementation and
has strengthened its leadership role in policy dialogue. Cross-sectoral team coordination
efforts have been successful. Future coordination should entail initiatives directed
towards Nicaragua’s Atlantic Coast, a region of extreme poverty but high economic
potential.
76.
The Bank should, in coordination with other donors, continue to support the
strengthening of Nicaragua’s national statistical agency, newly renamed INIDE, and
its systems for Monitoring and Evaluation, as well as administrative systems of key line
ministries. Problems with the 2005 Census demonstrated that there is need for the
GON to increase its capacity to monitor and evaluate and to produce reliable
statistics. Under the new CPS, the Bank should also support the more frequent
production of poverty data and should ensure that the M&E systems for programmatic
operations and for investment loans will generate data on poverty-related programs and
project outcomes in a timely fashion. In addition, more work is required on the part of
the Bank team to improve and adopt a results based focus for M&E. This was seen in the
development of the CAS/ISN matrices and the lack of distinction between: (a) national
development goals; (b) expected country actions and outcomes in pursuit of those goals;
and (c) the expected outcomes of Bank projects in support of those goals.
77.
As in many countries, national development efforts and donor coordination
are undermined by weaknesses of national leadership in development planning, as
evidenced by the long delays in the production of the 2005 version of the National
Development Plan. Efforts to improve the investment planning process (through the
SNIP) and to develop SWAp strategies are steps in the right direction, but Nicaragua will
need ongoing support to strengthen its planning capabilities at sector and national levels
to establish a strong framework for the effective orientation of donor assistance.
78.
The Ortega administration faces many opportunities as well as many
challenges. The new Administration has indicated that they would like the Bank to
concentrate on sectors vital to meeting anti-poverty goals, including those of
infrastructure (i.e., roads, water) and education. The GoN has also articulated that it
would like Bank assistance to improve institutional models for better service delivery and
sustainability. This coincides well with the Bank’s focus, which reflects a process started
during the last five years but needs deepening in order to concentrate significant
resources on priority areas which will have a greater impact on poverty reduction.
79.
The Bank should strengthen dialogue and reform through effective
implementation of the ongoing portfolio ($141 million, 11 active projects). The Bank
should undertake four or five new investment operations where it has comparative

70

advantages, and should determine areas for phased disengagement and/or exit strategies
in sectors where donors are willing and capable to take leadership.

Lessons

1. Initiatives taken by agencies that promotes the
performance of business sectors clustered together
should be focused, guided by a conceptual framework,
and proactive rather than reactive.
2. Reforms in the policy and institutional environment
require engagement with the legislative branch early in
the process, not just at the end of the process.
3. A results-oriented M&E system is critical in a LIL.
1. A prior analysis of the cost of rural access
requirements is appropriate in a telecommunications
project designed for rural habitants
2. Frequent changes in managerial leadership and weak
implementing agency capacity inhibit timely
progress
4. Decentralization, participation, communication and
capacity building are typical core needs in a
biodiversity program
5. Establishing a biodiversity conservation program
generally requires a long-term program approach.
1. There is a need to think strategically about the
institutional arrangements for managing competitive
funds.
2. If a fund is a part of an effort that is to give specific
attention to disadvantaged groups (such as indigenous
population) then some special earmarking with the
funds will be necessary to ensure that these groups
gain access to some of the funds, given their lack of
experience in preparing grant applications
3. Steps should be taken to ensure that adequate
resources are provided to provide support
disadvantaged groups in project preparation and
review.
1. Projects on a pension reform should be based on a
very careful assessment of the fiscal impact of reform
proposals before any policy discussions take place.
2. It is extremely important to garner broad based
popular and political support for reforms. Therefore,
serious consultations should be pursued, and broad
base consultations mechanisms supported with
technical work, before particular proposals are
supported.

1. Importance of sustained IDA presence.
2. Importance of borrower’s donor coordination. Part of
the project success is due successful donor
coordination, IDA, IDB, DANIDA which leverage all
financial aid to coordinate and ensure the effects of
assistance.
3. Micro enterprise is a highly successful, culturesyntonic method of routine maintenance in Nicaragua.
1. Scholarships targeted to the underprivileged help to
keep students in school.
2. Wider dissemination of information about the
activities being implemented by a ministry can help
win participation from key stakeholders and increase
the impact of project actions.
3. Choosing adequate indicators can support assessing
progress towards achievement of outcomes.
4. Investments on teacher training are most effective
when based on clear strategies on how to improve
teacher effectiveness through this vehicle.
Project interventions cannot be scattered across a wide
geographical area to have meaningful impact. In this
CPSe, project supported civil works and performance
based management systems were concentrated in the
same hospitals to optimize patient care
1. Testing alternative models of health care delivery can
help identify the most innovative and cost effective
approach. But if too many different approaches are being
tested simultaneously, it can lead to scattered strategies,
competing models, and increased supervision costs.
2. Inmediate goals of human resources development and
financial management need to be linked to to the higher
project objectives of delivering quality health services in
an adequate manner.
Dealing with a politically sensitive issue as Civil Service
Reform, the Bank needs to take time to make a thorough
assessment of the political ground that needs to be
covered in order to achieve reform.
1) New technology transfers that are appropriate and
divisible are not necessarily expensive.
(2) A project that finances subprojects with matching
grants and that operates in areas with disadvantaged or
special groups (or with activities in which they are
significantly involved), should earmark funds for these
groups.

The creation of a Preventive Maintenance Fund may only

Nicaragua Disaster Management Note

Devastating natural disasters have repeatedly highlighted Nicaragua's need for effective
disaster management. Although over the past 30 years the national government has
increasingly assumed operational and organizational responsibilities in this respect, the
main focus has been disaster response and relief. Moreover, there has been little
coordination and sustainability of programs due to the lack of a comprehensive disaster
management system. A historical breakthrough took place with creation of a National
System for Disaster Prevention, Mitigation and Response (SINAPRED) through Law No.
337 (officially published on April 7, 2000). The law's ratification has, for the first time,
placed coordination of disaster management with a civilian organization, the Executive
Secretariat, while also giving a major emphasis to prevention and mitigation. It was in
support of SINAPRED and the Executive Secretariat’s expanded hazard and risk
management mandate, and in response to the devastation brought by Hurricane Mitch,
that the World Bank prepared the Disaster Vulnerability Reduction Project (DVRP) at the
request of the Nicaraguan government.
How a comprehensive disaster management program supports the pillars of the
previous CAS
Private sector development: Natural disasters cause losses in property, income, and
investments as well as in human lives. The frequency of catastrophic natural events in
Nicaragua discourages private sector investment and hampers its growth. Measures taken
to reduce the adverse impact of catastrophic events such as the financing of small
mitigation works contribute to a more conducive environment for private sector
development.
Rural sector development and environmental protection: Like private sector
development, rural development is also set back whenever natural disasters occur.
Hurricane Mitch, for example, dealt a major blow to agricultural lands, severely
damaging export crops, such as bananas and sugar, and affecting the production of basic
grains. Besides financing planning and decision making tools such as vulnerability and
risk maps and mitigation measures to protect lives and property in vulnerable
communities of rural municipalities, the project financed an initiative specifically focused
on rural sector development and on environmental protection. A vulnerability analysis for
a major watershed established a methodology for watershed management from the point
of view of disaster management and identified environmental protection measures to
reduce disaster impacts.
Poverty alleviation: Poor communities are most vulnerable to natural disasters. In
Nicaragua, the communities hardest hit by Hurricane Mitch directly overlap with the
priority zones on the country's poverty map. It is widely recognized that vulnerability to
natural disasters reinforces the "vicious circle" of poverty in Latin America. Mitigation
measures can help to break the cycle and to reduce the risk of accelerated poverty in the
event of natural disasters in highly vulnerable communities.

86

A Selected Chronology of Natural Disasters in Nicaragua
Geographic location combined with weather, temperature, pressure and geological
conditions make Nicaragua one of the world's most disaster-prone countries, as
documented in the World Bank’s recent Hotspot study. A series of natural disasters in
the twentieth century, at the rate of one major disaster every two years, severely affected
Nicaragua. In the last ten years alone, disasters resulted in the deaths of over 3,300
people, displaced or otherwise adversely affected over 1.35 million people and caused
nearly US$ 1.5 billion dollars in economic losses. A selected chronology of the principle
disasters of the twentieth century follows:
•

In 1926 Nicaragua suffered a strong earthquake, destroying 80 percent of the
buildings in Le6n, and damaging 50 percent of housing stock in Managua. Likewise,
in 1931, an earthquake measuring 5.9 on the Richter scale left at least 1,000 people
dead and 2,000 injured. On December 23, 1972 three more major earthquakes
occurred in the Managua metropolitan area, all measuring above 5.0 on the Richter
scale. The earthquakes resulted in 10,000 deaths and 20,000 injuries. Managua
required extensive rebuilding and replacement of critical infrastructure.

•

In May 1982, Hurricane Alleta destroyed 60 percent of the country's corn crop, and
disabled 90 percent of cotton production resulting in US$480 million of economic
losses. In 1988, Hurricane Joan destroyed Bluefields, Rama, and Corn Island. The
economic loss amounted to US$840 million.

•

In 1992, the Cerro Negro volcano erupted, throwing thousands of cubic meters of
volcanic sand and ash over several thousand farming fields. The ash devastated more
than 500 houses and caused more than US$19 million in damages. An earthquake
reaching 7.2 on the Richter scale at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean in the same year
caused waves of 8 to 15 meters. The tsunamis affected approximately 250 Km of
coastal inland along the Pacific coast resulting in an economic loss of US$25 million.

•

September 1993 brought Tropical Storm Bret, which caused major infrastructure
damage. The storm affected more than 65,000 people and incurred more than US$5
million in damages. In 1995, intense rainfall beginning on September 24 and ending
on October 11 affected 1,300 people. Floods and mudslides caused US$17 million in
damages, of which US$11 million corresponded to the agriculture sector.

•

Hurricane Cesar's heavy rainfall in 1996 affected more that 6,000 people damaging
the Inter-American highway, local roads, Leon neighborhoods and parts of the
RAAN. The following year a prolonged drought resulted in substantial agricultural
losses in Leon, Chinandega and Madriz. Estimated economic loss totaled US$93
million.

•

Hurricane Mitch struck on October 1998 as the country began to emerge from a
lingering economic depression extending back to the civil war. Hurricane Mitch
caused almost 3,000 deaths and significantly affected more than 368,000 people. The

87

hurricane also destroyed a significant portion of the national transportation
infrastructure including 1,363 km of non-paved roads and 1,125 km of paved roads.
Infrastructure losses, future revenue loss, and physical damage impacted all sectors of
the economy. The agricultural market, particularly the coffee sector, lost 80 percent
of production. The hurricane destroyed 325 education centers and 23 bridges. Electric
systems and telecommunications incurred serious damages; however, authorities
rapidly restored basic services. The indirect and direct economic loss amounted to
US$3.8 billion. The extent of damage and the difficulty in responding more rapidly to
the devastation of Hurricane Mitch influenced the government's decision in
establishing the National System.
Whereas the greatest disaster of the twentieth century in terms of number of affected and
economic losses was Hurricane Mitch, it is important to note that the scope of the
destruction was not a result of wind, but rather rains and the ensuing flooding.

Evolution of the National Disaster Management System and the role of the Nicaraguan
Disaster Vulnerability Reduction Project
Following Hurricane Mitch, the Government took decisive measures to reduce
Nicaragua’s vulnerability to natural disasters. In the immediate aftermath of the disaster,
the Government, with help from IDA, identified specific critical areas endangered in the
aftermath of Hurricane Mitch, and carried out priority mitigation measures through two
projects implemented by the Nicaraguan Social Emergency Fund (FISE) and the
Nicaraguan Institution for Municipal Development (INIFOM).
With longer-term objectives in mind, the Nicaraguan Government decided to develop a
national disaster management system. With help from UNDP and the Governments of
Spain and Colombia, a task force headed by the Vice President designed a plan for a
National System for Disaster Prevention, Mitigation and Response. The plan led to the
passage of Law 337 of 2000, which created SINAPRED. To coordinate the System's
members, the Law established the Executive Secretariat for Disaster Prevention,
Mitigation and Response lodged within the Office of the Vice-Presidency and appointed
an Executive Secretary. The regulatory framework required to apply and execute Law

88

337 was established through Decree 53/2000, which became effective on June 28, 2000.
At the same time, the detailed responsibilities of all entities comprising the National
System were assigned officially through Decree 98/2000 (effective since October 5,
2000).
Under the Law #337, the Secretariat is charged with:
•
•

•
•

•

Making the System operational, ensuring appropriate staffing of the Secretariat
and of member agencies;
Preparing and activating a National Emergency Plan, clarifying policies,
procedures and standards to be applied, and training System members in the
Plan and, specifically, in their respective roles in disaster response, prevention
and mitigation;
Establishing a Disaster Management Fund to assure sustained financing for
emergency response and relief;
Establishing and maintaining a database, supported by geographical information
systems (GIS), relevant to disaster management, including information on
hazard and vulnerability assessments, as well as on programs, projects and
actions relevant to disaster prevention, mitigation and response; and
Establishing and coordinating working committees on sector issues and on
territorial issues to support disaster prevention and mitigation through national
agencies and local governments respectively.

In May 2001, the Government of Nicaragua signed an Agreement of Credit 3487-NI with
the International Development Association for the execution of the Natural Disaster
Vulnerability Reduction Project (NDVRP -P064916). The project, in coordination with
UNDP, was designed to assist the Nicaraguan Government address the five major sector
issues outlined above.
To address the need for a national mitigation strategy, the project supported the
SINAPRED inter-institutional commission (which includes technical agencies such as
INETER, MAGFOR, MARENA and MTI) by providing an information management
system and financing key studies to define both mitigation policies and future mitigation
activities.
Regarding the need to bring disaster awareness into public practice and to civil society,
the project financed the development of curricula for the formal education system. It also
financed a disaster awareness campaign for the general public through the media.
At the local level, the project supported emergency preparedness by ensuring the
organizing, training and equipping of emergency response committees in a significant
number of the at risk municipalities. In addition, the project provided mitigation help to
twenty five municipalities, selected as most vulnerable to natural disasters, by carrying
out technically supported risk assessments and vulnerability analyses and subsequently
developing "preventative" land use plans and specific disaster mitigation programs.

89

Finally, the project provided financing to implement a small number of high-impact,
priority mitigation measures identified in the twenty five target municipalities. In the
process, the project established the capacity to review similar projects technically and
environmentally.
Challenges
As a result of the activities financed by the DVRP, the Nicaraguan Government has
reduced it overall vulnerability to adverse natural events and is much better prepared to
deal with future events. Despite the advances realized in the institutionalization of the
national disaster management system and its operationalization, certain challenges
remain. They are as follows:
•

In an effort to bring disaster awareness into public practice and to civil society, the
project financed the development of curricula for the formal education system. The
curricula have been developed and validated by the relevant Nicaraguan Ministries,
but have yet to be implemented due to a number of factors.

•

The application of various risk reduction instruments developed under the DVRP at
the local and regional levels requires further assistance. The urban risk and
vulnerability maps and the ensuing response plans need to be disseminated through
formal workshops and public awareness campaigns. In addition, the areas covered by
this initiative need to be expanded to ensure complete coverage of all those areas at
risk in Nicaragua.

•

At the moment, the Nicaraguan Institution for Territorial Studies (INETER) has
successfully mapped the majority of the Pacific regions, yet lacks accurate
cartographic base material for the North and South Atlantic regions. This undermines
its ability to contribute to the application of the various risk reduction instruments,
specifically as pertains to reducing risk in the Atlantic regions, which are extremely
vulnerability to flooding.

•

At the municipal and territorial levels, disaster risk management practices need to be
integrated into the respective development plans so as to ensure compatibility with
other development initiatives, in particular as they pertain to environmental
management and housing.

Way Forward
In lieu of the need to extend the DVRP’s closing date to March 2009 to complete the
construction of the National Emergency Operations Center (CODE), which will house the
Executive Secretariat in times of emergency and will serve as the headquarters of
SINAPRED and the Nicaraguan National Civil Defense, a window exists to prepare an
additional financing paper to secure the funds necessary to successfully address the
identified challenges.

90

At the same time, the results of the Central American Probabilistic Risk Assessment will
be finished by the end of 2008; therefore recommendations from this study can be further
implemented by the government to address fiscal vulnerabilities to catastrophes.

CPS Consultations

INTRODUCTION

1.
The FY2008-12 CPS has been prepared through a broad participatory process
involving representatives of a wide range of government and non-government
organizations as well as various sectors of society. The CPS Consultations in Nicaragua
were carried out over a three month span (see Box 1). This annex provides a summary of the
issues raised during the consultations. The consultations in the territories were carried out
using a workshop format; presentations

with the Nicaraguan Government. In each
of the consultation sessions, the Bank presented a summary of the rational and objectives of
the CPS, the purpose of the consultations, a review of the previous CPS, an analysis of the
current portfolio, and thoughts for the future CPS. Following the presentation opportunity
was provided for discussion. Technical workshops were held on the following thematic
areas; rural financial services, access to land, the energy sector, the transportation sector,
gender, and nutrition. Each technical workshop varied in design and facilitation, more
specific information is provided in part D of this document.
3.
Participants in the consultations were universally supportive of the consultation
process. Many participants articulated that this was one of the first times this type of
consultation process had occurred. They also expressed the importance of continuing the
process and of follow-up (to be discussed later in this document). Participants were provided
a questionnaire on their opinions and perceptions about development in Nicaragua, poverty
reduction, and the work of the World Bank. Box 3 details the results of this questionnaire. It
is important to note financial support for these activities was provided by a trust fund from
DFID. The following sections detail the key findings from the CPS Consultation process.

92

B.

PARTICIPANTS’ VIEWS FROM TERRITORIAL CPS CONSULTATIONS

4.
A key finding of the CPS consultations was the importance of having access to
credit with low interest rates for micro and small farmers and businesses. In regards to
this topic, participants mentioned the high costs of financial services as well as the need for
technical assistance. Some participants from Rivas argued that people would be less likely to
migrate to other countries (Costa Rica, the USA) if they had access to credit (and thus
income generation) here in their own country. In addition, in nearly all of the territories the
World Bank Group was criticized for and associated with only offering loans with high
interest rates via private microfinance companies.
5.
Promoting the creation of social audits was another primary concern raised
during the CPS consultations. Participants felt that the judicial order on social audits and
its rights and responsibilities should be explained to civil society. What’s more they
articulated their belief that spaces should be provided and strengthened for citizen
participation. On the topic of follow-up and evaluation, participants felt that there needs to
be more investment in human capital in order to strengthen social auditing. On a local level,
participants felt that cooperative projects pertaining to social audits needed to be
strengthened as well more space provided for more functional open discussions (cabildos).
6.
A serious concern raised by participants was that decentralization needs to be
better promoted in the territories. Participants from Madriz stated that there must be plans
created from the local level to the national level which take into account the needs of
citizens. Importantly, institutional strengthening plans need to be made and set in place.
What’s more institutional coordination requires improvement and institutional policies need
to be shared with citizens. Ultimately, participants in the consultations expressed the opinion
that given decentralization efforts,
the distribution of resources (and in

The
territory of Boaco has many challenges in regards to obtaining potable water and sanitation,
and for this reason this was a topic of major concern for this area of the country. In regards
to production and income generation, participants from Estelí voiced the importance of
building secondary roads for production and to access markets.

CONSULTATIONS IN MANAGUA

9.
Consultations in Managua included those with the Government, the private
sector, civil society, and active donors. Consultations in Managua included the
presentations of recent analytic work (the PER and PA) as well as the policy notes mentioned
above (Energy Policy Note, Land Policy Note, and Access to Financial Services). In
addition, inputs from the territorial presentations were presented to participants as well as
results from the questionnaire (See Box 3). For these consultations a Mission from
Washington also joined the conversation.

Donors raised questions on potential gaps they saw in the World Bank program,
including the little mention of a nutrition program, attention to gender, and fighting
corruption. In regards to nutrition, the link was made between Bank support for a project in
the water sector, and the positive implications in the GoN’s Cero Hambre program. In
regards to gender, the Senior Country Operations Officer highlighted efforts in the active
portfolio, including the hiring of a gender specialist, the “cuadernos” or notebooks associated
with gender on topics including land titling, microfinance, the Atlantic Coast, and a Legal
diagnosis, and the visibility of gender indicators in the CPS Results Matrix. The Country
Manager responded to the theme of corruption, identifying the areas of good governance,
judicial reform and social auditing that serve to fight this important issue.

An important input in the development of the CPS was the meeting held with
civil society and the private sector. Many comments were offered in response to the

Similarly, the Public Expenditure Review (PER) promoted dialogue at the
consultation. Participants noted that in addition to high public expenditures on education,
there was also a high internal debt. They thought it would be valuable to know how public
expenditure allocations were determined. Discussion addressed not only the GoN’s response
to the internal debt, but also the potential role the Bank could play. Additional comments in
regards to the GoN presentation and the WB presentation included the following:
(1) questions pertaining to why the WB was not involved in a regional approach to address
the needs of the Atlantic Coast; (2) civil society members asked about the role and potential
involvement of NGOs in the development of the new program in the water sector; and (3) the
private sector voiced their concern that there are too many obstacles and conditions for
private companies to participate in infrastructure development and that policies should be
more flexible.
14.
The final consultation in this first series of the consultation process culminated
with a meeting with the Nicaraguan Government. The agenda was similar to those in
previous consultations. The key pieces of analytic work were presented as well as the Bank
CPS presentation and the Government priorities. The afternoon was devoted to reviewing
the following themes and their associated sections of the CPS Results Matrix: (i) economic
growth and macro economic stability; (ii) human capital development and social protection;
(iii) productive and social infrastructure; and (iv) governance reform. It was important to sit
with government representatives to define issues and obstacles as well as indicators and
milestones for the Results Matrix.

TECHNICAL WORKSHOP FINDINGS

15.
Technical Workshops were held in the following thematic areas: Rural Financial
Services, Gender, Nutrition, the Access to Land Policy Note, and the Energy Sector
Policy Note. This section discusses each workshop in depth. Key lessons learned and
findings from these workshops are presented. Follow-up thoughts are suggested for future
discussion. Each workshop was offered in coordination with counterpart Government
agencies.
16.
The Rural Financial Services (RFS) Technical Workshop was organized in
response to a request from the Minister of Agriculture (MAGFOR). The agenda was
developed in close coordination with IADB, RUTA and PROMIFIN-COSUDE. The main
focus of the workshop was to improve the Ministry’s understanding on ways to broaden rural
financial services from the Stat based on recent experiences in Nicaragua and throughout the
region. This included the ongoing discussion about a State Development Bank. As
mentioned above, preparation of the ToRs for the workshop, the scope of the discussion, as
well as the invitations of participants from private and public spheres was guided by
MAGFOR.
17.
Recent analytic work was provided to participants at the workshop, and utilized
as a platform for discussion. The World Bank Policy Note, “Nicaragua – Access to
Financial Services for the Productive Sectors” was presented at the workshop. In addition,

96

the Study on Public Policies and Rural Financial Services in Mesoamerica, written by a team
of researchers from the Regional Unit for Technical Assistance (RUTA), was presented, as
were regional experiences from BANRURAL-Guatemala and the Banco Estado para
Microempreseas from Chile. A panel of top officials and board members discussed with
participants lessons learned and best practices. A second panel of experts from Nicaraguan
microfinance discussed their experiences and offered recommendations to the Government.
18.
Main recommendations in regards to Rural Financial Services delivered to
MAGFOR include: (1) build strong relationships with the existing network of microcredit
institutions prior to the implementation of a State Development Bank (with a subsidized
interest rate); (2) analyze the economic strategies in rural households, including non-farming
income generating activities and the adaptation of RFS in this context; and (3) consider the
use of incentives to encourage coverage of RFS in depressed areas.
19.
The Technical Workshop on the Policy Note on the Energy Sector allowed for
continued dialogue about one of the most urgent matters for Nicaragua’s development.
The Energy Policy Note was presented and main finding were discussed with a wide variety
of audience members including Government officials in the energy sector as well as key
donors who work in the sector. The workshop served as a platform for dialogue between
different sector authorities on main challenges, potential solutions and recommendations.
Space was also provided for the World Bank and other donors to propose next steps and to
provide valuable technical support for strategic planning and decision making that will be the
GoN’s responsibility for the short and medium term.
20.
The Policy Note on Access to Land was prepared in response to a request from
the Minister of Agriculture. The Technical Workshop served to facilitate the sharing of
technical knowledge on land-based productive development based on international
experiences and lessons-learned from recent WB programs (Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras
and Brazil). Discussion also revolved around the recent Agrarian Reform process in
Nicaragua and its results. At the workshop, the Government expressed its desire to improve
the current policy framework on land and to have access to land as part of the CPS.
MAGFOR expressed that it is interested in a program that not only provides land per se to
rural poor families, but also the mechanisms to deliver the required technical, managerial and
financial services needed for these families to leave poverty.
21.
The Gender Workshop brought together Ministries and Government entities,
cooperating agencies, and representatives from civil society organizations. The
workshop served to learn about World Bank programs and importantly to share activities
executed by different government entities and cooperating agencies. In addition, the purpose
of the event was to identify opportunities and propose areas where gender would have a more
cross-cutting focus and impact. The Gender Action Plan was shared as well as presentations
of experiences from PRODEP, INTA and UNIFEM.
22.
Conclusions from the Gender workshop include the following: (1) the experiences
and lessons learned from women should be taken advantage of; therefore, women should be
identified as an integral part of economic development; (2) building knowledge about gender

97

issues needs to be promoted and concrete trainings should be implemented for practical use;
(3) effective policies need to be designed in regards to gender such as agreements with
mayors and concrete interventions; (4) the economic reality in Nicaragua must be
recognized, i.e. its high dependency on the participation of women in informal economic
activities; and (5) cooperating agencies should create safeguards for the theme of gender to
ensure the sustainability of their activities.
23.
The Nutrition Workshop served to promote the discussion of the Bank’s
involvement in the health sector for the next CPS. The workshop included presentations
from Bank staff and nutrition researchers as well as nutrition experts from UNICEF.
Presentations included: an analysis of the current situation in nutrition (1998-2005); the
provision of a conceptual framework and general panorama of the multiple causes of
malnutrition; and a presentation on a range of possible interventions targeted at the problem
of malnutrition and evidence of their impact.
24.
Comments received by participants at the Nutrition Workshop include: (1) every
institution has a specific role and specific responsibilities in nutrition; there need to be a more
common vision and central theme; although all believe in coordination, no one takes the lead
in coordinating; (2) there needs to be a map covering all of the programs in regards to
nutrition and health that reflects the current situation; thereby facilitating local and municipal
coordination; (3) although the formal education sector is important for implementing
nutrition programs, programs in the community are also important to develop hand in hand
with capacity building of local actors and leaders; (4) human resources need to be
strengthened with knowledge about nutrition; as it presently stands, there is no consistency in
capacity building in the field of nutrition.
25.
As mentioned above, follow-up and future steps are an important part of the
CPS Consultation process. Primarily, the results from the consultations are used as inputs
to the formation and development of the World Bank role in Nicaragua. Taking into account
the departments’ strategic development plans will also be an important reference point.
What’s more, the Bank has now distinguished itself in a new role, especially because of its
consultations in the territories. Future work includes distributing findings from the
consultations to the local level in written documentation (in Spanish), as well as holding
follow-up meetings.

Nicaragua: Evaluation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP)
Process and Arrangements under the Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility (PRGF)
July 6, 2004
Nicaragua is among the poorest countries in Latin America with a GNI per capita of US$710
in 2000. Poverty remains largely a rural phenomenon, heavily concentrated in the Eastern
and Northern parts of the country. Between 1993 and 2001, the share of the population living
below the poverty line declined from 50 to 46 percent and extreme poverty fell from 19 to 15
percent, but poverty reduction has been uneven across regions.
Nicaragua’s political context is one of a polarized society and political system, and weak
institutional capacity and governance. The nature of Nicaragua’s polarized society, a century
old phenomenon, and political instability have been a strong obstacle to consensus building,
constraining the process of participation and opening the policy debate, and on reaching
common grounds for broader ownership. Nicaragua’s political characteristics have
contributed to a weak institutional framework, blurring the separation of state powers,
weakening the rule of law and the protection of property rights, and leading to governance
problems. Moreover, the state has limited capacity to implement and control activities, with a
highly fragmented structure.
Throughout the 1990s, after the dismal economic situation left by the Sandinista regime,
Nicaragua has struggled with major macroeconomic problems, principally unsustainably
large fiscal deficits and debt levels. Repeated efforts to consolidate the fiscal situation during
successive government proved unsuccessful owing largely to recurrent expenditure overruns.
These recurrent failures put Nicaragua several times in extremely vulnerable positions, on the
verge of fiscal collapse and balance of payment crises. Hurricane Mitch at the end of 1998
inflicted serious damage to Nicaragua’s infrastructure and disrupted the macroeconomic
situation and fiscal consolidation efforts. The Bolaños government has made significant
efforts to improve macroeconomic stability.
Nicaragua’s macroeconomic vulnerability is one of the main challenges to poverty reduction,
including external factors (such as terms of trade shocks and foreign aid dependence). Other
major obstacles are the challenges in enhancing non-farm rural activities and in sustaining
rural income growth, the inefficient health services, high rate of population growth, and
chronic malnutrition.
The PRSP process
The timetable for implementing the PRSP process was rapid; in a year the government
moved from launching the Interim PRSP to reaching a HIPC decision point and completing
the PRSP. The Nicaraguan government embarked on the PRSP process because it was a
precondition for entering the enhanced HIPC initiative. This underlying motivation appears

99

to have driven many subsequent processes and decisions, including the depth and scope of
policy debate, which affected ownership perception across stakeholders.
The PRSP approach has on balance been relevant for Nicaragua’s national strategy process
and its poverty reduction efforts. The approach has addressed important gaps found in past
experiences, including through a widening participation efforts, appropriately focusing on a
comprehensive vision of poverty, and addressing a sorely lacking results-oriented
framework. In this connection, it has represented a more binding commitment than past
national strategies.
However, the PRSP process has initially showed modest results, which needs to be viewed
realistically in the context of political and institutional realities and very difficult starting
conditions. The PRSP did not initially strengthen policy processes, while poor public
expenditure management has been a hindrance to implementation. The fragmentation of
policy making has generated problems for coordination and overview of public investment,
and weak implementation capacity at the municipal level has remained an obstacle.
The consultation process for the PRSP was a step forward, but differences in views about the
purpose and legitimacy of such participation have caused assessments of the participatory
process to vary widely. This highlights the inherent difficulties of participation in a country
with a highly polarized political system. As a result, broad country ownership of the PRSP
has remained limited. Nevertheless, most observers agree that it was a helpful attempt to
foster a dialogue among the government, donors, and civil society. Survey results highlight,
however, that the area where participation was specially lacking was that of the formulation
of the macroeconomic framework.
The new government’s desire to modify the PRSP, with the introduction of a new
development strategy that sought to change the expenditure composition guided by a greater
emphasis on directly productive investment, was marked initially by tensions in the process.
The government felt constrained in its ability to pursue a revised strategy, while donors were
initially surprised by the initiative, expecting the PRSP to bring a more lasting and resilient
policy framework. This illustrates some of the potential tensions between different elements
of the PRSP process, notably between the provision of greater policy space to the
government and other objectives such as partnership. These tensions were increased in
Nicaragua by the poor alignment of the PRSP process with the domestic political cycle and
the limited policy debate early in the process on the tradeoffs involved in the growth strategy.
The potential tensions between normal political processes and the PRSP approach are
illustrated by the fact that, despite the emphasis on greater participation, the issues
concerning the growth strategy were not a topic of debate during the general elections.
However, the approach did eventually contribute to bringing critical issues in the open,
including through the Plan Nacional de Desarrollo (PND), thereby facilitating subsequent
work to create a more effective approach to poverty reduction. Even with the considerable
imperfections in the process, the fact that the debate has started to take place should be
welcomed.

100

World Bank effectiveness
A number of key findings and lessons emerge from the Bank’s support to the PRSP process
thus far.
The Bank has provided important support to the PRSP process.
•

The Bank was closely involved in the PRSP process, providing relevant analytic
inputs and advice. These non-financial services have been well aligned to the needs of
Nicaragua through the PRSP process, including two completed Poverty Assessments,
a PER, and an agriculture growth study. Key on-going analytical work includes a
CFAA, a CPAR, and a PSIA. The quality of the technical assistance and analytical
advice provided by the Bank is held in high regard by most informants.

•

The Bank’s CPS is well-aligned with the PRSP and closely follows the main strategic
pillars. The assistance strategy details the specific support to each pillar, in
recognition of the main constraints to poverty reduction outlined in the PRSP. The
move to programmatic lending through the PSAC and planned PRSCs is the most
explicit expression of the alignment of Bank support to the PRSP on the ground.

The Bank is improving its behavior in terms of promoting the PRSP principles.
•

According to stakeholders the Bank has become more open to dialogue with the
country and is taking steps to increase its responsiveness to civil society, both
reported as areas of weakness in terms of country ownership. The Bank is increasing
the cohesion of its large country program and is addressing the decentralization of
task managers. The agriculture growth study is an example of unprogrammed analytic
work being undertaken at the request of the government and demonstrates greater
responsiveness on the Bank’s part. The study was also produced in very close
cooperation with government officials, and represents a more participative approach
to the Bank’s work.

•

While the Bank may contribute to a technically sound strategy, the durability of a
strategy requires both the substance and process dimensions. The Bank could do more
in focusing on improving processes in Nicaragua and not just working towards
preparation and refinement of a strategy. The process management skills and
collaborative attitudes of the Bank need strengthening to allow country ownership to
grow, to allow negotiation processes to get to better results, and to achieve the vital
balance between technical and political quality in advisory services.

The Bank could do more to advance the debate on broad based growth and the trade-offs
between growth and poverty-related spending in Nicaragua.
•

There is widespread perception that the emphasis on social sector spending has been
imposed by the Bank. In reality, there is an inherent incentive and bias towards social

101

sector spending by government given the link with use of HIPC resources and, rather
than an imposition of a “social agenda” by the Bank, the key issue is the absence of a
frank discussion of growth issues in Nicaragua.
•

The growth-social balance is a technically very complex discussion. It is connected to
highly contended political issues and to conflictive political processes—but it needs
precisely for that reason to become a more public debate in an appropriate forum,
based on arguments rather than mutual mistrust. The Bank should promote and
participate in this discussion, integrating the process under the PRSP framework. The
ongoing Development Policy Review, with its focus on sources of economic growth,
may play a positive role in this regard. Involvement of stakeholders during
preparation, for example through feedback on drafts or presentations of preliminary
findings, and appropriate dissemination are likely to be important factors in this
works value-added to the PRSP process.

The Bank could play a more aggressive role in supporting government led donor
coordination.
•

The Bank has in the past not played an effective role in coordinating its activities with
those of other donors in Nicaragua. There have recently been promising steps taken
towards improving the situation on which the Bank can build. These include
improved coordination and participation in its analytical work and the emphasis on
SWAps in theCPS.

•

Improved aid coordination will require continuing efforts to clarify own policies,
positions and procedures, willingness to cede donor-side leadership to other donors,
and, as a particularly important signal in this area, assistance to the government
enabling and motivating it to coordinate the support from the World Bank and the
IDB.

The PRGF and IMF support
The Fund’s internal policy formulation process for Nicaragua under the PRGF/PRSP
approach was initially not very different from previous practices, although there is some
evidence of improvement over time. Macroeconomic stabilization efforts took up most of the
attention, and while emphasis on growth and poverty issues has occupied a more prominent
place in the internal process, they have not received the consideration that would have been
expected under the new approach. Fund technical assistance has generally supported the
priorities highlighted in the PRSP, including tax reform and banking crisis resolution.
Program negotiations, rather than the PRSP, remained the driving force behind the
formulation of the macroeconomic framework because of several factors including: pressing
initial conditions and lack of government credibility; a PRSP macroeconomic framework that
was quickly superseded by events; and lack of operational guidance on some major policy
tradeoffs in the PRSP. Some sensitive but critical issues (i.e., the resolution of the banking
crisis and its fiscal consequences) were not part of the broader policy debate, reflecting

102

government choice. The focus of the PRGF-supported program on macroeconomic stability
issues diverted efforts from its linkage to the PRSP’s growth pillar. Moreover, limited growth
analysis prevented the considerations of tradeoffs, including between alternative fiscal
consolidation paths and infrastructure investment.
The initial design of the PRGF-supported program did not differ significantly from earlier
ESAF-supported programs, with a key element of the macroeconomic framework being the
path of fiscal consolidation. This was in part because both the government and the
IMF staff considered stabilization a priority and made it the main axis of the program.
However, more recently there appears to be greater fiscal flexibility, including with regard to
the accommodation of potentially higher aid flows. Structural conditionality in the PRGFsupported program was streamlined, focusing on financial system and public sector issues
that have major macroeconomic relevance in Nicaragua and have been highlighted in the
PRSP as key priorities. But the burden of quantitative performance criteria did not diminish.
The policy space for government-led initiatives and flexibility to political considerations in
the context of the PRGF-supported program did expand over time—mainly reflecting
increased government credibility and a more stabilized macroeconomic environment.
This was reflected, for example, in the context of policy choices associated with the approval
of the 2003 budget, the passage of tax reform legislation, and the process of asset recovery
from liquidated banks.
Key components of the PRGF-supported program—the need of fiscal consolidation and
macroeconomic stability—have been government owned, but the program has lacked broader
ownership. Despite recognition of increased outreach efforts by the Fund, the formulation of
macroeconomic policy is still regarded as not being open to a broader policy debate outside
of traditional negotiations between the IMF staff and the authorities.
To a large extent, this reflected the choice of the government. Opening program negotiations
to non-government actors is not realistic, but efforts by both the government and the IMF to
broaden the discussions of macroeconomic policy could contribute to an explanation of
various policy choices and a better understanding of trade-offs. So far, the PRSP has had
little impact in this area, although the use of technical commissions, akin to the one
employed to formulate tax reform proposals, may be one approach worth exploring further.
The CPSe of Nicaragua illustrates that, when macroeconomic stability issues still require
significant attention, PRGF arrangements may only be expected to move gradually to cover
in-depth growth and poverty aspects, taking into consideration initial country circumstances.
But the issues of how to transit from stabilization to growth and enhanced growth analysis—
including consideration of key tradeoffs—would eventually require heightened attention to
move towards the key features of the initiative.
Bank-Fund cooperation and the JSA
Joint Staff Assessments were insufficiently candid in some key areas, notably the constraints
to participation, but nevertheless played a useful role, identifying country specific risks to the

103

implementation of the strategy as well as areas where further development of specific
policies in the PRSP or policy prioritization was needed.
However, the Progress Report did not play the central role that would have been expected in
the ongoing debate on the growth strategy and modification of the PRSP, and the associated
JSA could have signaled the limited use of the Progress Report in this respect.
The World Bank and IMF have collaborated closely since the PRSP, with country offices
playing a key role, providing inputs to the respective programs, and participating regularly in
meetings with civil society groups in various fora. The area of governance and legal reform,
of prominent importance in Nicaragua, is an example where collaboration appears to have
been effective, leading to a clearer delineation of responsibilities and conditionality.

Debt Sustainability Analysis

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND AND
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
NICARAGUA
Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis18 2007 under the
Debt Sustainability Framework for Low Income Countries
Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
the International Development Association
Approved by José Fajgenbaum and Martin Fetherston (IMF)
and Ernesto May and Vikram Nehru (World Bank)
August 14, 2007

Based on the joint Low-Income Country Debt Sustainability Framework of the World Bank
and the IMF, Nicaragua is assessed to be at moderate risk of debt distress. Its debt ratios
have improved dramatically over the past several years (on the back of fiscal consolidation
and debt relief under HIPC and MDRI) and are projected to remain on a declining trend in
the medium term under the baseline scenario. However, some stress tests suggest that there
are still potential debt vulnerabilities, particularly if substantial government borrowing takes
place at less concessional rates and the projected increase in growth rates does not
materialize. Reducing the risk of debt distress will depend on maintaining sound
macroeconomic policies and continuing pursuit of fiscal consolidation. In addition,
formalization of pending debt relief agreements with bilateral and commercial creditors
remains a key challenge for further reducing Nicaragua’s debt burden.
I. BACKGROUND
1.
This is the second debt sustainability assessment (DSA) for Nicaragua prepared under
the joint Bank-Fund Low-Income Country (LIC) Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF).19
The 2005 DSA showed that Nicaragua was at a moderate risk of debt distress. In the absence
of reliable data on private external debt, the external sustainability analysis is limited to
public and publicly-guaranteed external debt. That said, BIS data through end-2006 suggest
that foreign claims on the Nicaraguan non-financial private sector are relatively small
(US$270 million, about 5 percent of GDP).
2.
Nicaragua has made progress in reducing its external debt burden in the context of
the HIPC and MDRI initiatives. External debt has fallen from about 160 percent of GDP in

2003 to 85 percent in 2006, and is expected to decline further in 2007, following the debt
relief offered by the IDB under MDRI. Still outstanding are the formalization of debt relief
with non-Paris Club bilaterals and the restructuring of private commercial debt. Indeed,
among low-income countries, Nicaragua has one of the highest ratios of outstanding debt to
non-Paris Club creditors as well as to private commercial creditors.
• Progress under HIPC. After reaching the completion point in January 2004, Nicaragua

received debt relief under the HIPC initiative from all its Paris Club creditors, the IMF,
the World Bank and the IDB, as well as a number of non-Paris Club creditors.
Nevertheless, delays persist in negotiations with other non-Paris Club creditors. As of

leading to a 16 percent of GDP reduction in stock of external debt. Further, in March
2007, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) joined the MDRI and agreed to
provide debt relief for about US$786 million in nominal terms (14 percent of GDP). Total
debt service savings from the MDRI are estimated at roughly US$1.9 billion.20
• Progress in restructuring private external debt. Negotiations are ongoing towards

resolving outstanding debt in arrears to private creditors of roughly US$1.4 billion in
nominal terms (about 20 percent of GDP).21 A buy-back proposal, to be supported by the
World Bank Debt Reduction Facility (DRF), has been prepared and the authorities hope to
close the operation in the coming months. The operation is estimated to cost
US$61 million (about 4.5 cents on the dollar), and it is expected that the World Bank will
contribute up to a maximum of US$32.6 million, donors an additional US$25 million, and
Nicaragua up to US$3.4 million.
20

The estimated debt service savings include: US$143 million from the IMF, US$773 million from the World
Banks and US$984 million from the IDB.

21

The original face value of debt in arrears to private creditors is about US$0.2 billion, with accrued interest
representing the remaining US$1.2 billion.

Domestic debt has fallen in recent years as a result of fiscal consolidation.
Domestic debt jumped to over 35 percent of GDP in 2001-02 reflecting the fiscal cost of the
2000-01 banking crisis and the settlement of claims arising from property expropriations in
the 1980’s (the latter are labeled as recognition of contingent liabilities in our public sector
DSA template). By end-2006, domestic debt fell to about 23 percent of GDP, reflecting an
increase in the fiscal effort and a sharp reduction in real domestic interest rates. The bulk of
the domestic debt now outstanding (80 percent) is in the form of claims arising from former
property expropriations, with the remaining amounts mainly in the form of compensation
bonds related to the banking crisis.

II. UNDERLYING DSA ASSUMPTIONS
4.
The medium-term framework underlying the DSA envisages an important pickup
in real growth, and gradual reductions in the external current account deficit and official
assistance. The baseline scenario assumes improved macroeconomic conditions over the
medium term on the back of continued prudent macroeconomic policies and the
implementation of structural reforms in the energy sector and public financial management to
underpin assumed productivity gains. The key assumptions are summarized in Box 1. The
assumptions used in this year’s DSA are broadly similar to those in the 2005 exercise, with
the exception of output growth, which is projected to be somewhat higher on account of: (i)
the implementation of reforms in the energy sector, resulting in cheaper and more reliable
electricity service; (ii) the entry into CAFTA and increased regional integration, resulting in
increased access to markets and trade spillovers; and (iii) increased efficiency of public
investment following the adoption of public financial management reforms.

107

Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions in the Baseline Scenario
Real GDP growth is projected to average 5.0 percent for the period 2007–12, increasing to 5½ for the
subsequent years. This reflects expected returns from higher investment in infrastructure and human capital, as
well as productivity enhancing effects of CAFTA-DR and the implementation of structural reforms (including
in the power sector). Real growth during 1997–2006 averaged 3.8 percent, reflecting several negative shocks
including Hurricane Mitch in 1998 and the 2000–01 banking crisis, among others.
Inflation, as measured by the GDP deflator, decreases in the medium term and stabilizes at around 2.2 percent,
in line with the rate of crawl and partner country inflation.
The external current account is assumed to improve gradually as exports benefit from continued investment
in the tradable sector and rising volumes of traditional exports, while tourism activity converges to regional
levels. Revisions to the external current account reflected unrecorded interest paid by the financial system.
•

The non-interest current account deficit excluding official transfers gradually declines converging to under
½ percent of GDP by 2027. This definition of the external current account, which was also used in the
2005 DSA, captures the underlying trends in the current account and gaps to be financed externally by
official loans and private capital flows (see Table 3).

•

Imports are expected to grow at over 8½ percent per annum (compared to an average of about 11 percent
over the past decade), while export growth is expected to remain robust, averaging over 11 percent during
2007–12 (slightly lower than the 13 percent historical average). The moderation in import growth is
underpinned by the stabilization of oil prices and some strengthening of the import-substitution sector. The
strong export performance reflects: (i) increased market access resulting from CAFTA-DR, (ii) enhanced
competitiveness through the implementation of structural reforms under the program (resulting, among
other things, in cheaper and more reliable electricity service and improvements in public infrastructure);
and (iii) continued investment in the tradable sector.

•

Improvements in the current account are being driven by an important increase in domestic private savings,
reflecting a further strengthening in financial intermediation and increased corporate profits as productivity
gains materialize.

Net official external assistance (loans and grants) is expected to decline from about 12 percent of GDP in
2007 to under 2 percent by 2027, as Nicaragua becomes an emerging economy and attracts more private capital
inflows. New external borrowing after 2010 is projected to increase at an annual rate of 2 percent (in line with
the U.S. inflation rate). Exposure to multilaterals and bilaterals is projected to remain unchanged at the average
level during 2007–10, with the gap filled through commercial non-concessional loans.
Domestic debt issuance is limited to US$250 million during 2007–12 (US$50 million per year), reflecting
additional claims arising from property expropriations. Domestic real interest rates are unchanged at 8 percent.
The primary surplus of the combined public sector is assumed to remain unchanged at around 0.3 percent, the
levels agreed to for 2010, consistent with a policy of maintaining the revenue-to-GDP ratio constant at about
20 percent of GDP. Focusing on the combined public sector ensures that that projected deterioration in the
finances of the social security system is offset by improvements in the finances of the rest of the public sector
(i.e. central government).

The baseline scenario assumes that by end-2007 outstanding debt to non-Paris
Club bilaterals will be settled on HIPC-equivalent terms, as well the restructuring of
private external debt. Nicaragua is not currently servicing debt to non-Paris Club bilaterals,
except for the outstanding debt to Taiwan Province of China. Therefore, the debt relief
assumed from these creditors would imply an additional stock of debt cancellation in 2007 as
well as a minor impact on the external debt service obligations paid in cash.22
6.
The baseline scenario also captures the new lending terms from the IDB that were
agreed with the implementation of the MDRI. These terms are the outcome of an evaluation
similar to the one conducted by IDA after granting the MDRI, where resources are allocated
consistent with a country’s risk of debt distress. On a net basis, the level of concessionality of
new IDB lending will be lower than before MDRI. Nicaragua would receive loans from the
IDB on the following terms: half of the total amount of a loan will be lent at an interest rate
of 0.25 percent, a loan maturity of 40 years, and a grace period of 39.5 years; the other half
will be lent at an interest rate of 5.5 percent, a loan maturity of 30 years, and a grace period
of 5 years. The concessionality of the combined loan is expected to be above 35 percent.
III. EXTERNAL SECTOR DSA
7.
Under the baseline scenario all external debt indicators remain below the policydependent debt burden thresholds. The debt-burden thresholds used for the analysis are
those applying to medium performers in terms of policies and institutional quality, as
measured by a three year moving average of the World Bank’s Country Policy and
Institutional Assessment Index (CPIA).23 In the context of these thresholds, the main results
of the DSA show that, in the baseline scenario, almost all the external debt indicators are
expected to improve over the 20-year projection period (Annex Tables 1-2 and Figure 1), and
also remain below the indicative risk thresholds for debt distress throughout. For instance,
the NPV of the debt-to-GDP ratio initially increases from about 28 percent in 2007 to over 37
percent in 2013. Then it decreases to about 20 percent by 2027, remaining always below the
40 percent indicative threshold.
8.
Debt service is expected to remain manageable throughout the DSA horizon,
reflecting the high concessionality of both existing and projected new debt. Debt service
indicators are projected to average 3.8 percent of exports (10 percent of revenues) during the
medium term and slightly increase to about 5 percent of exports (16 percent of revenues)
22

External debt service in cash (after debt relief from non-Paris Club bilateral creditors) would increase by an
average of about ¼ percent of GDP per annum during 2007–12, falling gradually thereafter.

23

The cut-off value of the CPIA index to be classified as a strong performer is 3.75. For the current DSA, the
three year moving average of the CPIA for 2004-2006 corresponds to 3.74 which means that Nicaragua should
be classified as a medium performer. The decline in CPIA has been driven by the deterioration in the indexes
controlling for (i) gender equality, (ii) the quality of public administration, and (iii) transparency, accountability,
and corruption in the public sector.

109

during the later years of the projection period. The increase is explained by the projected
reduction in concessionality of new borrowing as Nicaragua has more access to international
capital markets.
9.
Further, the rate of external debt accumulation under the baseline scenario is
manageable. The annual increase in the NPV of public external debt is substantially below
5 percent of GDP per annum during 2007–09 and declines gradually for the rest of the
projection period. In addition, it is expected that as Nicaragua graduates as a PRGF and IDA
country, access to highly concessional borrowing will gradually decrease over the medium
term, as reflected by the reduction in the grant element indicators (see Annex Figure 1).
10.
However, the standard stress tests reveal some potential vulnerabilities in
Nicaragua’s debt situation. In particular, the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio breaches the
threshold of 40 percent under some specific standardized bound tests that simulate a series of
negative shocks to real GDP growth, the contracting terms of new public sector loans, and
current account adjustment , among others.
• The less favorable official financing scenario corresponds to the most extreme shock. In

this scenario, the NPV of external-debt-to-GDP ratio breaches the threshold of 40 percent
by 2011 and though it falls over the medium term it remains above the threshold level
through-out the projection period. In addition, the NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio surpasses
the threshold of 250 percent by 2016. Nonetheless, all other debt indicators, including
debt service indicators, remain well below distress thresholds.
• The lower growth scenario assumes real GDP growth stabilizes at 3.8 percent, the

equivalent of the average observed during 1996–2006. Under this scenario, the NPV of
external-debt-to-GDP ratio also rises above the 40 percent threshold by 2012. This
scenario is labeled as the high-investment-low-growth scenario, since it implicitly assumes
that the programmed increase in investment does not translate into the productivity gains
assumed in the baseline scenario over the medium term. As a rule of thumb, a one
percentage point decline in long-term growth, ceteris paribus, would translate into
roughly a 4-5 percentage point increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio over a 10 year period.
• The no external adjustment scenario (also labeled historical scenario) assumes that the

current account remains at the high level of 16.8 percent of GDP observed in 2006.24
Under this strong assumption, debt levels would increase without bound, with the NPV of
the external-debt-to-GDP ratio breaching the 40 percent threshold by 2013.
11.
Given uncertainties, the baseline DSA does not include potential aid flows from the
ALBA Cooperation Agreement.25 There is still uncertainty about the types of aid from the
24

Rather than using the current account average over the past 10-year (standard), the current account for 2006
was regarded as more representative, given current high oil prices and Nicaragua’s reliance on oil imports.

channeled through the private or the public sector. Further analysis on these aid flows is
presented in Annex Box 2.
IV. PUBLIC SECTOR DSA
12.
Total public debt is projected to decline over the projection period (Annex Table 4
and Figure 2). Under the baseline scenario, while combined public sector debt in gross
nominal terms is projected to increase over the
next 5 years, debt levels decline when public

sector assets accumulated as a result of the fiscal
effort are included.26 Moreover, debt in NPV
terms is projected to decline sharply given its
highly concessional nature. The underlying
public sector debt position monitored under the
program, which excludes the assets of the social
security system,27 is projected to decline by
about 10 percentage points in roughly a decade,
from about 56 percent of GDP in 2007 to about

13.
The baseline scenario is associated with a sharp decline in domestic debt, and a
hump in the share of external debt. Given the fiscal effort and the external financing
assumptions under the baseline scenario (which envisage a sharp increase in concessional
external borrowing during 2007–12), the share of domestic debt is projected to decline
rapidly over the next 5 years. This decline in domestic debt is consistent with a buildup in
government deposits in the banking system, the counterpart to an increase in net international
reserves (as projected under the program), required to further increase coverage ratios. The

Includes financial assets (i.e. deposits) accumulated by the combined public sector. Physical assets resulting
from public investment expenditures are excluded.
27
The public debt under the program excludes the social security system to avoid over stating the underlying
improvement in the combined public debt dynamics during the projection period. While the social security
system is projected to accumulate assets over the next 15 years, preliminary analysis suggests that ensuring its
long-term sustainability will require a parametric reform, including reducing pension obligations.

111

substitution of expensive non-concessional domestic debt for concessional external debt also
forms part of the government’s strategy to reduce public debt vulnerabilities and ensure
sustainability.
V. CONCLUSIONS
14.
Nicaragua’s external debt is subject to a moderate risk of debt distress. The baseline
projections that assume full HIPC and MDRI debt relief show that all the standard external
debt indicators remain below the thresholds over the projection period. However, under some
stress tests the NPV of external-debt-to-GDP ratio and the NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio
breach the threshold of 40 and 250 percent, respectively. This combination of a favorable
baseline, tinged with some downside risk, suggests an overall moderate risk of debt distress.
15.
The risk of debt distress remains moderate once domestic obligations are
introduced into the analysis. Strong macro policies, including a primary public sector
surplus of about 0.3 percent GDP—combined with favorable growth-interest rate dynamics
arising from the high level of concessionality Nicaragua is expected to benefit from in the
foreseeable future—would ensure putting public debt on a declining path. This path seeks to
strike a reasonable balance between preserving space for needed public investment while
reducing vulnerabilities given Nicaragua’s large exposure to foreign currency denominated
debt and external shocks, including natural disasters. It is important to recognize, however,
that the baseline scenario represents a departure from some of the parameters seen in
Nicaragua over the last decade, especially in terms of higher projected GDP growth and an
improving trade balance. In this regard, it will be crucial that the authorities implement the
policies and structural reforms underpinning this more favorable medium-term outlook.

112

Box 2. DSA Implications of ALBA Cooperation
The DSA baseline excludes potentially-large, yet uncertain, development finance under the auspices of
the ALBA agreement. A brief description of the staff’s current understanding is included below, though these
are still tentative and subject to revision.
• Structure. The Venezuelan state-owned oil company (PDVSA) supplies crude oil and derivatives to
Nicaragua’s state-owned oil company (PETRONIC), which in turn has up to 90 days to sell these oil
deliveries in the domestic market and transfer the full proceeds to PDVSA. Half of the total proceeds are
then channeled to ALBA institutions: ALBA-Bank and ALBA-Fund. These multilateral institutions will be
managed by a council of ministers from member countries. The ALBA-Bank would provide concessional
loans to private and public sector entities in Nicaragua and in other ALBA-member countries (the terms of
these loans remain unclear); while the ALBA Fund would provide grants. In addition, the authorities
recently announced the creation of ALBANISA, a new consortium to develop an oil refinery in Nicaragua,
with a 55 percent participation of PVDSA and a 45 percent stake of PETRONIC.
• Size. If fully implemented, the agreement could cover up to 27,000 barrels of oil and derivatives per day
(Nicaragua’s full oil import bill), which at current market prices could represent proceeds of up to 5 percent
of the GDP per year. However, given domestic capacity constraints, actual oil imports under a scheme may
be much smaller, since PETRONIC’s share of the local retail market (including the demand of state-owned
generators) is roughly 4,500 barrels per day, the equivalent of about 0.8 percent GDP.
The program has been designed to allow spending up to a maximum of 2 percent of GDP in ALBArelated concessional financing. In that regard, the program contemplates a downward adjustor on the overall
fiscal balance floor on ALBA financing up to a threshold of 2 percent of the GDP per annum. According to
staff’s DSA analysis, additional concessionally financed spending of up to 2 percent of GDP per annum can be
absorbed without crossing the 40 percent of GDP threshold on external debt sustainability applied to lowincome countries (LICs) rated as medium performers with regard to policies and institutions under the joint
IMF-WB DSA framework. The ALBA scenario assumes the new disbursements from the Agreement amount
to 1 percent of Nicaragua’s GDP in 2007 and 2 percent of the GDP during 2008–2010. Ceteris paribus, the
NPV of external debt to GDP ratio is tangent to the 40 percent debt burden threshold in 2012–2013, and
declines to converge to the baseline debt profile in the medium term.

1/ Includes only public and publicly-guaranteed external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that NPV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the NPV of new debt).

Annex H:

Country Financing Parameters

Item
Cost sharing. Limit on the proportion of
individual project costs that the Bank may
finance

Parameter
Up to 100 percent

Recurrent cost financing. Any limits that
No specific limit
would apply to the overall amount of recurrent
expenditures that the Bank may finance?

Local cost financing. Are the requirements for Yes
Bank financing of local expenditures met,
namely that: (i) financing requirements for the
country’s development program would exceed
the public sector’s own resources (e.g., from
taxation and other revenues) and expected
domestic borrowing; and (ii) the financing of
foreign expenditures alone would not enable
the Bank to assist in the financing of individual
projects?

Taxes and duties. Are there any taxes and
duties that the Bank would not finance?

None

Remarks / Explanation
Specific arrangements would be determined
for individual projects, based on project
context, staff’s judgment of Government
commitment in the sector concerned,
portfolio-wide limits given by IDA
allocations and co-financing by other
partners, including through SWAps. Low to
moderate country contributions are expected
to continue for most projects.
Consistent with the Government’s own
prudent fiscal stance, Bank recurrent cost
financing will remain subject to
consideration of the overall medium-term
fiscal sustainability and is expected to stay
broadly within the ranges of recent years.
Targets for the overall levels of public
borrowing and for the overall composition
of recurrent and capital public expenditures
would be agreed to in our macroeconomic
policy dialogue. Within this framework,
projects at the sector level would be free to
establish any ratio of current to capital
financing in a way that best promises to
meet project objectives in a sustained
manner, and only after careful consideration
of: (i) the likelihood of project
sustainability, and (ii) necessary future
budgetary outlays.
The two requirements are met. The Bank
may therefore finance local costs in the
proportions needed in individual projects.

The Bank may finance the costs of taxes
and duties associated with project
expenditures, as long as they are reasonable
and non-discriminatory. As of December
2004, no taxes or duties are identified as
unreasonable or discriminatory. In
individual projects, the Bank will consider
whether taxes and duties constitute an
excessively high share of project cost.

Type of lending refers to hard and soft lending. Soft lending is defined as education lending for curriculum development,
teacher training, administration of exams, policy development and technical assistance to MINED; Hard lending is defined as
lending for the construction of schools and classrooms as well as in the case of the World Food Program, to the school feeding
program.
2
Where noted information was not available for FY08-FY12.
3
Basic education refers to a range of educational activities in various settings (formal, non formal and informal), that aim to
meet basic learning needs. It can comprise primary education (first stage of basic education) and lower secondary education
(second stage) as well as pre-primary education and/or adult literacy programs.
4
Projects include: Excelencia- curriculum development, teacher professional development and technical assistance (US$
7,841,913), Alliances for Education and Health- teacher professional development and institutional strengthening (US$
6,214,767), Proyecto Nicaragüense de Apoyo al Sector Social (PRONICASS)- institutional strengthening (US$ 684,598),
CETT- writing and comprehension (US$ 250,000).
5
Projects include; Proyecto de Nivelación de Bachillerato para Enfermeras, Proyecto de Apoyo al Diseño curricular del
Bachillerato de Jóvenes y Adultos CAM, Proyecto Vulcano de Habilitación laboral MEC, Programa de Alfabetización y
Educación Básica de Adultos Fase III, Programa de Alfabetización y Educación Básica de Adultos en León y Chinandega,
Instituto de Desarrollo e Innovación Educativa IDIE/OEI.

1.
The above table shows active donor involvement in the education sector in
Nicaragua, with largest donors in the top rows descending to smaller donors. Detailed
information is presented on projects, the type of lending1, the total assistance, the amount to be
disbursed during the CPS period (FY08-12) and additional information including that on
education level (basic, preschool, primary, and secondary).
2.
As seen above, the Embassy of Denmark, the Canadian International Development
Agency (CIDA) and the European Union support the Programa de Apoyo al Sector
Educación (PROASE). PROASE is the largest basic education project at this time, with a total
of about US$ 90M. The funds are made available to the MINED and can be used for either soft or
hard lending purposes. Also, Canada is a silent partner managing $US 40M funds from the
Netherlands.
3.
As noted in the table, the IDB supports both hard and soft lending activities. Only
$164,017 remains of the original US$ 10M to be disbursed of the Educacion Basica para Jovenes
y Adultos project (which began in August 2004) and no other plans have been made. However,
the IDB supports remodeling and construction of schools through their Programa de Inversion
Social Municipal with US$ 8.12M left to be disbursed.
4.
The Japanese Embassy is currently in the process of determining its involvement in
hard lending. Currently they are conducting a preliminary study to determine their role in the
constructions of education centers (primary and secondary) prepared for natural disasters in the
northern region (Matagalpa, Jinotega, Estelí, Madriz and Nueva Segovia).
5.
While many donors provided accurate current information, others are still in the
process of identifying their involvement in the sector including the Icelandic International
Development Agency (AECI), the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation (AECI), the
French Embassy and the Luxemburg Cooperation. However, in the case of support from the
United Nations Population Fund (UNFP) most of the funds are from Luxemburg, while the
Cooperation itself is still in the process of identifying its soft lending activities (teacher formation
support in the normal schools).
6.
Total lending to be disbursed is approximately $US 150M (FY08-12, known to date).
Nearly all of the lending is for soft lending, with the exception of Inter-American Development
Bank’s support for the remodeling and construction of schools (US$ 8.12M), the World Food
Program which self identified its provision of a school feeding program as hard lending (US$
15.3M), and the anticipated hard lending from the Embassy of Japan for the construction of
centers in the northern region of the country. Given this, hard lending proportionate to total
lending to be disbursed is about 15%.
