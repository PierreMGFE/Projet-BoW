EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This World Bank Group Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Albania covers the period FY 1 1FY14 and is the first CPS to be presented to the Board following Albania’s graduation from IDA in mid2008. The CPS is fully aligned with Albania’s National Strategy for Development and Integration
(NSDI), which was prepared by Government following a broad participatory process involving
stakeholders throughout the country. The CPS program also takes into account the lessons learned
through implementation of the last country strategy, the findings of Bank analytical work and other
donor’s’ activities.
Albania has been a development success story in many respects. Over the past two decades the
country has made enormous strides in establishing a credible multi-party democracy and market economy
and it is rapidly re-integrating into the international and European communities. In addition, over the past
decade, Albania has been one of the fastest-growing countries in Europe, enjoying average annual real
growth rates of 6 percent, accompanied by rapid reductions in poverty. Poverty fell by half (to about 12.4
percent) between 2002 and 2008, while extreme poverty now affects under 2 percent of the population.
In addition, the country has made solid progress towards achievement of the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs), although social indicators still lag significantly behind the EUlO and Croatia.
Albania is one of a very few countries in Europe which was able to maintain positive - albeit
significantly reduced - growth rates and financial stability in 2009, despite the global financial and
economic crisis. Thus far, the impact of the crisis has been transmitted mainly through lower remittances
and trade. A substantial fiscal expansion in 2008 and 2009 also helped cushion the impact of the crisis,
but needs to be unwound quickly. Given the slower recovery in Europe, Albania’s growth prospects
could be less favorable than in the past. The key challenges going forward are the following: (i) early
resumption of fiscal consolidation and strengthened public expenditure management; (ii) regulatory and
institutional reforms to boost competitiveness and investment; (iii) improvements in education levels and
skills to meet the demand from businesses; (iv) reduction of infrastructure deficits in a fiscally sustainable
way; and (v) improvements in the effectiveness of social protection systems and key health services to
avert new vulnerability risks that could arise as a result of the slow recovery. In addition, given that
Albania is very vulnerable to climate change (due to high dependence on water for power and irrigation
for the economically-important agriculture sector) it is vital that the country moves rapidly to
appropriately adapt its water infrastructure and usage to changing climatic conditions.
The joint Bank Group CPS program will help Albania to meet the above challenges, by focusing
on three strategic objectives as follows:
Supporting a recovery in Albania’s growth rates through improved competitiveness, by
strengthening macroeconomic and public expenditure management, improving the
business climate, affordably addressing infrastructure bottlenecks, and deepening access
to credit
Broadening and sustaining social gains by improving education and health services and
establishing an adequate safety net
Reducing vulnerability to climate change by improving water conservation and
management and increasing disaster preparedness
Under this CPS, a “one-WBG” approach aims at a more focused, synergistic program, with
coordinated IBRD-IFC engagements in the following priority sectors: (i) national infrastructure - energy
and roads; (ii) municipal infrastructure, mainly water supply and solid waste management; and (iii) the
business environment. Moreover, the CPS program reflects a deepening sub-regional focus in the
Western Balkans and South-East Europe especially in energy, tradekransport and disaster management.
1

The CPS program will also continue to support governance improvements in Albania through
use of a “governance filter” for all Bank-financed operations in order to promote management, efficiency
and transparency improvements across government ministries.

A main focus of the Bank’s effort under this CPS will be to focus on improving the
implementation of the large ongoing portfolio of Bank-financed operations in Albania (which are fully
relevant to the developmental challenges described above). New projects will be added very selectively,
and only in a small number of crucial areas. The focus on the existing portfolio is needed in order to
deliver the expected development impacts while improving the pace of resource transfer to the
Government as it faces new fiscal constraints. A key goal will be to further integrate Bank-financed
operations into Government’s budget and administrative framework to realize across-the-board gains in
public expenditure management and transparency. The strategy of lending for fewer, larger projects both
responds to Government’s explicit request in this regard as well as allows for the completion of the
consolidation of the investment portfolio to 10-12 operations by FY 14 (from 21 projects in FY04). This
in turn, will free up Bank internal resources for more analytical and advisory work with Government on
Albania’s emerging challenges.
New IBRD lending to Albania over the CPS period is expected to amount to about $275 million
while IFC expects to increase itsfinancing for the private sector to a level of $120-150 million. Of the
total IBRD lending, which will be contingent on IBRD’s financial capacity, just over 35 percent (or $100
million) could be provided in the form of quick-disbursing policy-based budget support, assuming a
satisfactory macroeconomic framework. Annual budget support would likely be on the order of $25
million, initially for a social sector policy reform operation and subsequently for a series of three DPLs
focused on growth and investment. Remaining new IBRD support will be provided in the form of about 8
investment operations for social sectors, natural resource management, infrastructure, and public sector
reform. IFC’s investments will be channeled through direct financing in key sectors including
agribusiness, energy and social sectors. Financial sector investments will strengthen banks’ capitalization
(where needed) and provide long-term financing for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs),
renewable energy and energy efficiency products. IFC will also use its advisory services to secure private
financing through PPPs for road maintenance, water supply, solid waste management and renewable
energy.

Implementation of the CPS is subject to four main risks. First, delays in effecting afiscal
adjustment or a deepening of the crisis in the Eurozone could compromise macroeconomic stability
thus affecting the planned budget support program. To accommodate these risks, the CPS program has
been designed to be flexible -- enabling a reduction in quick-disbursing lending in the case of continued
fiscal expansion or, conversely, a substantial increase in budget support if Albania is hit hard by external
shocks despite sound macroeconomic policies. Second, the polarizedpolitical climate in Albania could
lead to policy and/or institutional gridlock. While it is difficult to fully address this risk, it is hoped that
the consensus between the parties on the European Union (EU) accession agenda will help achieve
progress. Third, given that new IBRD lending is relatively small and increasingly selective, it is possible
that the Bank’s ability to influence sectoral reforms through policy dialogue and institutional
development could be reduced - especially as concessional financing from the EU becomes more readily
available. This, however, need not necessarily affect results on the ground as the Bank Group will
continue to provide analytical and advisory services to help Albania meet its development challenges.
Moreover, the Bank will continue to partner closely with the EU on many programs of relevance to
Albania’s development. Finally, portfolio performance could be affected by ongoing constraints in
Government’s implementation capacity, though these are being addressed through capacity building and
consolidation of the Bank program.

I. INTRODUCTION

1.
This World Bank Group Country Partnership Strategy for Albania covers the period F Y l l FY14 and is the first CPS to be presented following Albania’s graduation from IDA in mid-2008. The
last World Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy for Albania was approved on January 10, 2006 and
covered the period FY06-09. Implementation of the strategy was assessed through a CAS Progress Report
(CASPR) presented to the Board in May 2008, and through a comprehensive CAS Completion Report
(CASCR) attached in Annex 2. The lessons identified in the CASCR, country priorities as laid out in the
Government’s National Strategy for Development and Integration, analytical work undertaken by the
Bank and the activities of other external partners were critical in shaping this strategy for FY 11- 14.

2.
Albania enters the new CPS period having weathered the global financial and economic crisis
reasonably well - maintaining positive, albeit significantly reduced, growth rates in 2009 and a sound
banking sector. The impact has mainly been felt through remittances and trade, while the fiscal
expansion that helped to cushion the impact of the crisis, needs to be unwound quickly. Given the
uncertain prospects in Europe and difficulties in Greece - a major economic partner for trade, investment
and remittances - the next few years are likely to be much less favorable. The key challenges to
improving Albania’s growth prospects in this environment include: (i) the early resumption of a sound
medium term fiscal framework and further strengthening of public expenditure management; (ii)
improving implementation of Albania’s already broad program of regulatory reforms to boost
competitiveness and investment levels; (iii) continuing to close the infrastructure gap in a fiscally
sustainable manner; (iv) deepening the private sector access to credit. Meanwhile, the slow recovery is
likely to take its toll on the most vulnerable necessitating a renewed attention to improving the
effectiveness of social protection systems and accelerating progress on social indicators. Finally, Albania
is rapidly coming to terms with its climate change challenge - as the second most vulnerable country in
Europe and Central Asia - primarily relating to the management of its water resources on which the
country is heavily dependent for energy and agriculture.
3.
The joint Bank Group program presented in this CPSfocuses on the implementation of a large
ongoing program in Albania that is already supporting the abovementioned challenges, while
selectively introducing new IBRD lending of around $2 75 million, and increasing IFC financing for
the private sector to a level of $120-$150 million. Of the total IBRD lending, which is conditional on
IBRD’s financial capacity, just over 35 percent (or $100 million) could be provided in the form of quickdisbursing, policy-based budget support - assuming satisfactory macroeconomic framework - with the
remainder devoted to investment operations for the social sectors, basic infrastructure, natural resource
management and public sector reform. The new activities are fully spelled out for the first two years of
the CPS but only indicative descriptions are included for the outer years, in order to retain flexibility to
adapt the program to emerging circumstances. IFC will also mobilize other funds especially for private
participation in infrastructure through its advisory services. This joint strategy will continue the tradition
of strong collaboration between IFC and IBRD, particularly in the water, transport and energy sectors. It
will also build on the deepening sub-regional focus in the Western Balkans and South Eastern Europe in
key sectors such as electricity, trade and transport and disaster mitigation and management.

11. COUNTRY CONTEXT
A.

Country Background

4.
With a population of about 3.2 million, Albania is situated in the Western Balkans and enjoys
a favorable geographic location in South-East Europe and valuable natural resources. Not only is the
country close to much larger economies (Greece, Italy) - which are important as trading partners, hosts of
Albanian migrants and sources of investment - its natural resources include significant hydropower
potential, large swathes of fertile agricultural land, over 360 kilometers of Mediterranean coastline with
excellent tourism and transport potential, and valuable mining deposits.

5.
Albania has come a long way in establishing a multi-party parliamentary democracy since the
fall of the communist dictatorship in 1991, although the political environment continues to be affected
by a high degree of political polarization. Political stability has increased with a gradually improving
conduct of successive national and local elections (the latest in 2009) with associated non-violent - albeit
sometimes rancorous- hand-overs of power between the two dominant parties: the center-right
Democratic Party (DP) led by Prime Minister Sali Berisha and the Socialist Party (SP) now led by Tirana
mayor Edi Rama. The governing coalition currently in power is led by the DP for its second term
together with a small left-leaning party, the Socialist Movement for Integration. The legitimacy of the
constitutional system is well accepted, and despite recurrent controversies over electoral results, parties’
efforts to gamer votes act as a key determinant of their platforms. Nonetheless, the political environment
is very polarized, often to the detriment of constructive debate and policy stability.
6.
Albania has made important strides in re-integrating into the international and European
communities after decades of isolation, and has been an important contributor to regional stability in
the Balkans. The country became a member of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 2008 and
formally applied for EU candidate status in 2009, after ratification of its Stabilization and Association
Agreement, originally signed in 2006. In April 2010, Albanian authorities submitted the responses to the
pre-questionnaire necessary to prepare an assessment of the country’s readiness to fulfill EU membership
obligations. Within the Balkan region, Albania has promoted regional stability and collaboration
wherever possible, while remaining a strong supporter of Kosovo independence. Successive Albanian
governments have consciously and systematically avoided the notion of a “greater Albania” among ethnic
Albanians across the region, and have maintained strong ties with all of its regional neighbors.
7.
Albania has also seen rapid economic growth and major social change over the past decade.
Once labeled as the continent’s poorest country, Albania has been one of the fastest-growing economies
in Europe, enjoying annual real economic growth rates of around 6 percent over the last decade. Today,
with a GDP per capita of US$3,836, Albania is a lower middle-income country, and graduated from IDA
lending in mid-2008. The country has also experienced rapid social change, including internal migration
from rural to urban areas and mass emigration of economically active citizens who are a source of
substantial remittances (ranging from 11-14% of GDP annually).
8.
The rapid growth in GDP has been accompanied by an equally impressive decline in poverty.
Nearly half of Albania’s poor had been lifted out of poverty between 2002 and 2008. The poverty headcount fell from 25.4 percent in 2002 to 12.4 percent by 2008 and extreme poverty is very low at under 2
percent. Besides rapid growth, significant increases in public and private wages and pensions have been
contributors to this reduction in poverty. Poverty reduction was initially more pronounced in rural areas
(29.6 percent in 2002), but the decline in rural poverty has accelerated substantially in the last 5 or so
years and is now approaching urban rates (14.6 percent in 2008). Nonetheless, there are areas of the
country - mostly the mountain areas -- where poverty remains high (29.8 percent), contributing to

2

increasing income inequality. In addition, in the rural areas, female-headed households have experienced
only a one-third the rate of poverty reduction as male-headed households.
9.
Albania is well on its way to achieving most of the MDGs, but remains an outlier among its
European neighbors on most health and education indicators. Albania’s position on the Human
Development Index has improved steadily to a rank of 70 in 2009, in line with Western Balkans’
rankings, but significantly behind the rankings of the EUlO countries and Croatia. There have been
notable improvements in some of Albania’s social indicators. For instance, enrollments in all levels of
education (early childhood, primary, secondary and tertiary) have increased. Similarly, infant mortality
fell from 15.1 per 1,000 live births in 2004 to 10.3 by 2009. However, as Table 2 below shows, Albania
still has significant challenges to converge with regional standards in the area of secondary enrollment,
child and maternal mortality rates, and in access to safe drinking water.

10.
Despite the strong record of growth, poverty reduction and social welfare achieved thus far,
Albania faces a number of important challenges going forward, especially in the wake of the global
financial and economic crisis. The recovery to sustained economic growth while maintaining poverty
reduction trends will require concerted efforts to increase investment and raise labor productivity (growth
has been largely jobless to date and based on productivity improvements from the reallocation of
resources across sectors). Albania will need to raise its competitiveness as an investment location within
Europe by addressing key bottlenecks in the business environment, and by raising the skills base in the
labor market. In addition, given the uncertain prospects in its external environment and the likely toll on
the poor and vulnerable, Albania should also move to accelerate reforms aimed at improving the
effectiveness and efficiency of its social protections services.
0

First, on the macroeconomic management front, there will be a need to correct the recent
fiscal expansion and establish a more sustainable fiscal framework for the medium term. To
underpin this framework, the authorities should also accelerate improvements in public

3

expenditure management, notably: (i) raising the efficiency of social spending, (ii) careful
pacing of needed public investments in infiastructure; (iii) improving disbursement of
Albania’s substantial - but increasingly less concessional - donor financing; and (iv) a
concerted effort to attract more private financing for infrastructure and social services, over
time.

B.

Second, securing robust improvements in the business environment is crucial not only for
increasing Albania’s competitiveness, but also for making progress on its EU integration
agenda. Albania has undertaken a broad program of regulatory reforms, but implementation
continues to lag substantially behind new laws and regulations. This lag contributes to a high
level of uncertainty in the business environment (in turn, possibly exacerbated by ongoing
political polarization) that significantly lowers returns to private investment in Albania.
In order to maintain the rapid poverty reduction trends, even in the more difficult
environment, Albania will also need to broaden its social gains to date. Reforms in education
are needed to broaden access, particularly at secondary and higher levels, and to improve
quality at all levels to bring Albania’s skills base more into line with its European neighbors
so that it can compete for jobs. Meanwhile health indicators remain comparatively low,
particularly for women, and the effectiveness of social programs to reach the remaining
vulnerable groups needs improvement.
Recent Developments

(i) Political Developments

11.
One year after the most recent Parliamentary elections in June 2009, the Albanian political
environment remains marked by tense relations between the opposition and the coalition Government.
The Democratic Party finished ahead of the Socialists by only about 1 percentage point in the June
elections, but secured a majority in Parliament thanks to support from the Socialist Movement for
Integration (a smaller left-leaning party). The Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights
(ODIHR) of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) certified the elections as
better than previous ones, although still with some shortcomings. After the elections, the SP refused to
take its seats in Parliament, demanding a partial recount. However, its appeal to the courts was rejected.
Meanwhile, the DP has expressed its full support of the original Electoral College decision not to sanction
a recount. In this context, the President and the international community mediated a compromise in
which SP parliamentarians took their seats in Parliament just ahead of a February 2010 constitutional
deadline. However, a two day marathon session in Parliament failed to bring the parties to an agreement,
and the SP has since abstained from parliamentary sessions. In early May 2010, the SP organized a series
of public peaceful protests and a 19-day hunger strike demanding a recount. Recent pressure from the
European parliament, in the context of the ongoing candidacy process, has brought the parties together to
negotiate a resolution and has already facilitated a resumption of the opposition’s participation in
Parliament.
12.
Public opinion polls suggest that the prospect of EU membership (and, more immediately, the
prospect of visa liberalization with the EU) is a widely-held aspiration of the Albanian electorate and
provides powerjul motivation for many political and economic actors. EU integration is a central
element in the platforms of both major parties, while, several European actors have reiterated that the
efficient functioning of democratic institutions, including Parliament, remains an essential political
criterion in the ongoing candidacy process. As such, the EU integration processes are expected to
continue providing an important and credible anchor for Albania’s political development over time. That

4

said, there remains a not-insignificant risk that continued political tension in Albania may intermittently
impact development progress and the accession anchor, as well.
(ii) Economic developments
13.
Albania has had a successful record of sustained growth over the last ten years, averaging 6
percent per year, while maintaining stable inflation, interest and exchange rates (Figures 1 and 2).
Growth has been the result of major structural transformation, based largely on the movement of labor
from low productivity agricultural occupations to services and construction, and, to a lesser extent, to
manufacturing. The high rates of economic growth have not been matched by rapid increases in
employment. Indeed, employment remained stagnant in all years except 2008 which saw only a marginal
improvement. Still, Albania avoided excessively high open unemployment due to massive emigration of
skilled and unskilled workers, particularly to Italy and Greece. The inflow of remittances from migrants
has fluctuated between 11 and 14% percent of GDP, annually, and has been an important source of
demand while also helping to achieve the rapid declines in poverty cited above.

14.
For most of the last decade, growth has been underpinned by a stable macro-economic
framework, in turn the result of soundfiscal and monetary policies. From 2002 to 2007, a gradual
fiscal consolidation based on improving revenue administration contributed to a downward trend in the
overall deficit and a decline in public debt from 62 to 53 percent of GDP between 2003 and 2007. In
addition to low and stable inflation, Albania’s flexible exchange rate system has proved to be a good
shock absorber. In this environment, the financial system saw a rapid expansion of private credit from 4.2
percent of GDP in 2000 to 37.4 percent at the end of 2009.
However, Albania met the global financial and economic crisis in a period offiscal expansion.
15.
In 2008, Albania embarked on a path of fiscal expansion through a rapid increase in government
investment (from 5.8 percent of GDP in 2007 to 8.7 percent in 2008, associated mainly with one large
road project) and subsequent increases in public sector wages and pensions, which elevated total spending
to 33.7 percent of GDP in 2009 from 29.2 percent in 2007. Combined with relatively limited exposure to
international markets and comparatively low levels of credit to GDP, the result was that Albania was one
of the few countries in Europe that experienced positive growth rates in 2009, albeit at a much slower 3
percent.

5

16.
The Government’s delay in adjusting spending plans throughout 2009 resulted in deteriorating
macroeconomic indicators. By 2009, the fiscal deficit had risen to 7 percent of GDP (of which, 4.6
percent was financed through new borrowing and 2.4 percent was covered through privatization
proceeds). Meanwhile the gradual impact of the global crisis materialized with remittances falling from
13.5 percent of GDP in 2007 to 10.7 in 2009, and a significant slowdown in exports. The increasing
current account deficit, which reached 15.2 percent in 2009, was financed by exceptional privatizationrelated Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and expensive public sector external borrowing - the
Government contracted two syndicated loans (of around half a billion Euros) in 2008 and 2009. As a
result, public debt also rose -to 59.6 percent of GDP from 53.7 percent in 2007.
17.
The banking sector has withstood the crisis reasonably well. Albania’s banking sector was one
of the few in the region with a large positive net foreign assets position, especially compared with other
countries in the region. This was related to prudent bank management as well as limited credit lines of
foreign banks for Albania, which in turn meant very limited private external debt. Moreover, active
supervision by the central bank helped to avoid contagion, despite the fact that Albania’s banking sector
is dominated by foreign banks from around the region. After an early sharp drop in late 2008/early 2009,
bank deposits have since recovered to pre-crisis levels at the beginning of 2010. Meanwhile, nonperforming loans rose slightly, but the situation remains manageable. Levels of provisions at 6 percent of
the loan portfolio and capital adequacy ratios of about 16 percent of total assets remain at comfortable
levels and should be able to absorb further negative shocks.

Growth prospects in the coming years are less favorable - external conditions are tougher and
Albania needs tofind new sources of productivity growth. Albania faces a tough external environment
with tighter capital and investment markets, a deteriorating situation in one of its main economic partners
(Greece) and the likelihood of a much slower recovery in Europe. Graduation from IDA has been
accompanied by several other development partners also moving to less concessional financing. In
addition, the country?s past productivity growth has been based on the reallocation of labor from
agriculture to other sectors, on demand driven by earnings of external migrants, and the impact of
regulatory reforms aimed at improving the business climate. Both these sources are likely to become less
important over the medium term. Under these conditions, Albania can expect to grow at a slower pace
over the short-to-medium term. Growth in 2010 is likely to be only marginally higher than in 2009, with
a projected slow recovery from 201 1 depending on the outturns in Europe as a whole.
Albania will need a renewed focus on maintaining the conditions for economic growth and
19.
poverty reduction by reducing current macro-fiscal risks, raising the returns to investment, and
Re-establishing its tradition of sound macro-fiscal policy in an
improving labor productiviQ.
environment of tighter external financing and an uncertain European economy will require more cautious
budgeting over the next few years. A careful pacing of domestically financed public investments over the
medium term as well improvements in the efficiency of large social expenditures are also key. In
addition, Albania will need to dramatically improve its competitiveness as an investment location in
Europe, by following through on business environment reforms. In particular, Albania needs to close a
persistent gap between its steady stream of regulatory reforms and their subsequent implementation, and
to reduce the uncertainties stemming from cumbersome administrative procedures, corruption, weak rule
of law, and lack of secure property rights. Finally, Albania needs to accelerate reforms in the education
sector to increase access, quality and relevance to its labor market needs.

111. THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM AND SECTORAL CHALLENGES
A.

The National Strategy for Development and Integration

20.
In 2007, Albania approved the National Strategy for Development and Integration for 20072013, which was developed via a participatory process involving stakeholders throughout the country.
The NSDI aims to (i) integrate the country into the EU and NATO; (ii) develop and consolidate the
democratic state, notably through electoral, judicial and property rights reform; and (iii) achieve rapid,
balanced and sustainable economic, human and social development. The NSDI has established target
growth rates of 6-7 percent and aims to reduce the poverty headcount to below 10 percent by 2013. The
NSDI states that macroeconomic stability is to be supported by fiscal consolidation and reduction of debt.
Infrastructure investments would concentrate on roads and transport, energy, and water supply and
sanitation. In the social services, the Government aims to increase secondary education enrolment to 76
percent, introduce a basic package of covered health benefits, strengthen the coverage of the social
assistance, and reform the public pension system. Moreover, following the 2009 Parliamentary elections,
the Government reiterated the focus on water sector (including both water supply and sanitation, but also
on irrigation to improve agricultural productivity) and the health sector as areas where resources would be
concentrated in the next 2-4 years.
B.

Improving Macro Management, Budget Processes and Public Expenditure Management

2 1.
Given the recent fiscal expansion, Albania needs to return to the more prudent fmcal policy
that served the economy very well between 2002 and 2007. Sound macro-economic management
(especially a prudent fiscal stance, flexible exchange rates and sound monetary policy) was fundamental

7

to the rapid expansion of the economy over most of the past decade. However, the sharp increase in the
overall deficit (and reduction in public saving) in 2009, resulting in a level of debt nearing 60 percent of
GDP have raised concerns about the fiscal framework, particularly in the absence of a new IMF program
to provide an anchor for fiscal policy since the successful completion of the last program in 2008. Given
the uncertainties in Europe and the capital markets, Albania needs to move quickly to withdraw the recent
stimulus, consolidate its fiscal position, increase public saving and begin to reverse recent increases in
public debt. It should be noted that Albania, with Bank support, has made important strides in
strengthening its institutional capacities for debt management, in time for its graduation from IDA and its
entry into the international capital markets (see Box 1). Notwithstanding this, given the fiscal trends over
the past few years, a revised fiscal framework would be well-served by some type of anchor mechanism,
such as a fiscal rule, consistent with long term debt sustainability, to increase the confidence of the
financial markets and investors that Albania has resumed its strong macroeconomic record of the past.
Without the anchor of a credible fiscal policy Albania would be at the risk of higher financing costs and
uncertain availability of finance, which may increase macroeconomic volatility.
22.
Albania should also continue to further strengthen its expenditure management systems, as the
underpinningfor both itsfiscal policy and the effective implementation of the NSDI. Albania has made
significant progress in putting in place the institutional framework for sound budgeting, most recently
with the passage of the new Organic Budget Law which enshrines, inter alia, medium term budget
practices that have been followed for some years, and with new procedures for public investment
planning. However, this needs to be complemented by: (i) stronger enforcement of the new rules and
procedures; (ii) more transparency and fewer reallocations at the budget execution stage, to preserve the
integrity of the annual and medium term budgeting processes; and (iii) more ex-post monitoring and
analysis to reinforce incentives for improving the quality of medium term budget plans. Completion of
the long-delayed Treasury system (currently underway) and the subsequent development of a modern
integrated financial management information system would allow not only to strengthen day-to-day
management of expenditures, but also to link spending with NSDI objectives and program outcomes, and
improve monitoring of development programs, as a whole. Similarly, Albania has also made some strides
improving its fiduciary systems. It continues to receive support from a number of development partners,
not least the Bank and the European Union, on completing the reforms of public procurement and on
deepening improvements in financial management.

23.
Building confidence in Albania’s macroeconomic management will also require an
improvement in the production of national statistics, in particular, national and fiscal accounts.
Albania has had a longstanding need to strengthen its macroeconomic statistics and has been receiving a
range of donor support for this purpose but the assistance has been very small and relatively
uncoordinated. National accounts and labor and employment statistics are notably the weakest areas, and
require urgent attention given their importance as key signals to economic actors in a modern market

8

economy. More urgently, however, there is also a critical need to adhere to a fixed calendar for the timely
release of all macroeconomic data. The global financial crisis saw a tendency in many countries towards
a hands-on management of the production and release of key national statistics. The current crisis in
Greece demonstrates the risks of not having accurate, transparent and timely economic data. Reinforcing
the capacity and independence of the National Statistical Agency to produce robust and unbiased statistics
would also help to further underpin both the soundness and credibility of macroeconomic policy in
Albania.
C.

Strengthening the Framework for Private Investment

24.
In recent years, Albania has taken important steps to upgrade the regulatory framework for
business. The Government has been implementing a comprehensive reform program to establish an
efficient, sustainable and transparent regulatory system, with the goal of increasing investment levels,
enhancing competition and stimulating business growth. These efforts are reflected in the improving
Doing Business indicators and ranking: Albania moved from 136* in 2007 to 82nd in 2010. Its
performance on the Global Competitiveness Index and on the Heritage Foundation?s Index of Economic
Freedom has also improved significantly in the recent years. However, the overall rankings mask
considerable variation in rankings for individual indicators. For example, the country?s Doing Business
rankings ranged from 15? for protection of minority shareholder rights, to 91st on enforcing contracts, to
173rdon getting construction permits, the Index of Economic Freedom includes rather low scores for
protection of property rights and freedom from corruption. In addition, the business environment remains
more difficult for women who are poorly represented in ownership of firms, compared to other countries
in ECA.
25.
A significant gap remains between officially-adopted regulatory policies and their
implementation and enforcement, explained in part by the still-weak rule of law. The enforcement gap
significantly reduces the high returns to private investment in Albania, deterring both foreign and local
investors and imposing costly time and bribe ?taxes?, thus eroding some benefits of regulatory reform.
Analysis of recent firm surveys (2007-08) demonstrates that firms? productivity, propensity to export and
their employment creation are hampered by lack of the predictability over enforcement of rules, and the
time taken to comply with regulations. Meanwhile, Albania continues to see its lowest rankings among
the World Governance Indicators (WGI) on control of corruption and rule of law, which are the only
areas in which it is on par with an below the average level for lower middle income countries,
respectively.

?

26.
Albania?s investment climate is also substantially undermined by unclear property rights and
weaknesses in land administration. A survey conducted in 2008 as part of the Investment Climate
Assessment (ICA) found that insecure property rights and access to land were considered to be severe
obstacles to investment by a large majority of firms, with small- and medium-sized firms
disproportionately affected. Moreover, anecdotal evidence suggests that foreign investors are often
deterred from investing in Albania due to difficulties in obtaining access to land or premises with clear
legal title. Exacerbating the uncertainty surrounding property rights is the apparent inability of the courts
to successfully resolve disputes and/or to enforce decisions taken through judicial processes. The
Government is well aware of the issues surrounding property rights and their implications for private
investment and has adopted some appropriate policy responses. Implementation has lagged, however,
due to a highly variable legal framework, coordination failures, capacity constraints and corruption.

?WGI indicators also include voice and accountability, political stabiliv, government Qectiveness and regulatory
quality on which Albania has improved significantly over the last decade.

9

27.
In addition, Albania faces a significant challenge with respect to supporting private businesses
in the adoption of the more sophisticated technologies that are needed in order to meet new EU
standards and regulations. While the authorities make progress on introducing new EU regulations and
standards, there is a need not only to improve their implementation from the public sector side, but also to
create an environment which allows private firms to acquire the necessary technical know-how to comply
with these requirements. Albania?s exporters remain concentrated in the bottom end of the global market,
mainly comprising unskilled processing with limited value added. A limited number of programs are
underway financed both by Government and development partners to raise the capacity on both sides to
implement new regulations, in particular in agriculture sector. However, these need to be complemented
by attention to the systemic constraints that hinder the usual changes for knowledge adoption and
innovation, for example, linkages with foreign direct investment, promotion of within firm worker
training and an effective quality and standards infrastructure.

D.

Closing the Infrastructure Gap

20.
Increasing the availability of good quality infrastructure is another critical element of the
Government?s efforts to enhance the climate for private investment and growth and ensure wider
inclusion. Indeed, firms interviewed for the Bank?s competitiveness assessment under the ICA identified
infrastructure bottlenecks - electricity supply, telecommunications and transport (including logistics) - as
the greatest obstacles to growth and investment.

29.

The unreliability andpoor quality of electricity supplies has regularly been cited by Albanian

firms of all sizes as one of their most critical constraints. In 2008, firms reported an average 32 outages

per month, necessitating widespread reliance on stand-by generators and inhibiting expenditures on
sophisticated technical equipment which might be damaged by power fluctuations. Aware of the
seriousness of this situation, the Government, in close cooperation with the Bank Group, has embarked on
a major reform of the power sector beginning in 2008, but much remains to be done. The government
began restructuring the power sector: the state-owned electricity company, Albanian Electroenergetic
Corporation (KESH), was unbundled and the retail distribution and supply business was privatized.
Under the new electricity tariff framework, the privatized OSSh is required to meet performance targets
for: (i) reducing transmission and distribution losses; (ii) increasing collection rates; (iii) improving
operational efficiency; and (iv) improving the quality of electricity. The sector has already begun to see
substantial improvements, in part because of management reform but also because of better hydrological
conditions, strengthening of the regulatory entity, and privatization of the retail supply. The next three
years will be especially critical in making the new structure and market model fully effective. First, the
financial, managerial and technical viability of the publicly owned energy companies in the supply chain
need to be strengthened and their associated inter-company arrears reduced. Second, there is a need to
make the recent privatization of the distribution sector effective through, inter alia, new investments to
reduce energy losses in distribution. Third, the Government will need to further increase generation
capacity, especially through small but efficient hydro projects. Finally, the sector?s contingent liabilities
to the Government will need to be substantially reduced.

Albania?s telecommunications infrastructure had been perceived as an obstacle to doing
30.
business but Government passed a telecommunications framework law in 2007 which is helping to
create a competitive market. In the past, significant numbers of Albanian firms have reported that
inadequate and costly telecommunications services are an obstacle to doing business (BEEPS 2005 and
2008). In response to these issues, the Government passed a new law in 2007 which has already led to
significant improvements including the entrance of a third mobile service provider in the market. As a
result there has been a notable a rise in the number of users of telecom services, significantly lower costs
and better quality of services. Further improvements will involve continued effective implementation
of the new law including at least four elements in the short to medium term: (i) appropriate regulations

10

regarding interconnection; (ii) number portability; (iii) fostering inter-market competition; and (iv)
competitive allocation of 3G and WiMax frequencies.
3 1.
Albania has been steadily improving its transport infrastructure, but there is a substantial way
to go before the road network reaches the average standard for lower middle income countries and
there is a need for much greater emphasis on maintenance. The overall length of the road network in
Albania totals about 14,500 km. The recent focus has been on development of the network and there have
been some investments in short and discontinuous sections of expressway (including Tirana - Durres,
Rreshen - Kalimash) - but the standard of the primary network remains inadequate. Meanwhile, the
local road network (about 4,411 km) is also in very poor condition with only 39 percent paved. The
recent establishment of a large Secondary and Tertiary Roads program, which aims to reconstruct and
rehabilitate 1700 km of local roads, should make a significant improvement. At this stage, the key
priorities for the road sector are to: (i) develop the connectivity of the network and bring it to a uniform
standard that is comparable with other countries in the region; (ii) remove the maintenance backlog; (iii)
provide sustainable management and financing systems; and (iv) continue institutional reform and
capacity strengthening to improve sector institutions, such as the nascent Albanian Road Authority. In
parallel, the country should also improve infrastructure and service delivery improvements, in the port
and rail sub-sectors, through private sector involvement, EU alignment programs and regional initiatives.
32.
Irrigation infrastructure is vital to tapping the agricultural sector’s comparative advantage but
remains in poor condition and needs to be adapted to changing climatic conditions. While Albania has
significant annual rainfall, less than 20 percent occurs in the six-month period from April to September.
making irrigation necessary for summer and perennial crops. Drainage and flood protection is also
important to agriculture, particularly in the low-lying coastal plains. Even after a decade or so of
investment in rehabilitating the extensive irrigation and drainage system (a legacy of communism), about
one third of the system still remains to be rehabilitated, and upstream dams and water sources need
attention. Meanwhile the institutional structures for the operation and maintenance are still weak Albania is still searching for sustainable and effective mechanisms for managing irrigation and drainage
systems that can better meet the changing needs of Albania’s agricultural sector. The Government has
recently made further improvement of the irrigation system, including the use of more modern methods
such as drip irrigation, a major priority in order to raise productivity in the agriculture sector.

E.

Broadening and Sustaining Social Gains

33.
Albania has been comparatively less successful in extending the benefits of its growing market
economy to the broader population. Growth, to date, has been largely jobless with only marginal
increases in employment. The impact of growth on poverty reduction has been achieved mainly through
sectoral reallocations of employment, migrant remittances to their families, as well increases in public
sector wages and pensions. In addition, social indicators in health and education, and in the coverage and
adequacy of social protection systems, lag significantly behind averages of the EUlO and Albania’s
regional neighbors. The slow economic recovery is likely to take its toll on the most vulnerable
necessitating a renewed attention to improve the effectiveness of social protection systems. However, the
pattern of vulnerability is likely to be gender-biased, as women face greater challenges than men in the
labor market.
34.
In education, the key challengefaced by the Government of Albania is to improve quality at all
levels while also improving access, particularly for secondary and higher education as well as for
rural households and minorities. This will require raising low secondary enrolment rates for boys and
girls (Albania has no gender significant differences in secondary enrolment, see Table 1 on page 3),
reducing large urban-rural disparities, and ensuring that students are better prepared to respond to labor
market demands. Albanians have, on average, fewer years of schooling when compared to EU and sub-

11

regional averages, and few students continue into higher education. There are also vulnerable groups
with particularly low enrolments, even in basic education. Quality, as measured by standardized tests,
also indicates serious challenges. To address these challenges, the Government has developed a National
Education Strategy (NES) for 2004-20 15 (covering pre-university education) which emphasizes quality
improvements as a way to encourage higher enrolment. The authorities have also launched a separate
strategy for higher education which focuses on improved governance and, financing mechanisms in the
public universities.
35.
To date, the Government has made good progress in implementing its National Education
Strategy, but will need to persist in and accelerate reforms in order to achieve educational outcomes
comparable to EUlO and Croatia. By the end of 2009, one-fourth of all teachers had received some
continuing education, student-computer ratios have declined from 6 1 to 25; and school overcrowding is
being addressed with only 18 percent of students attending multiple-shift schools versus 36 percent just
three years earlier. In terms of promoting accountability at the school level, all school principals have
been trained in management and education leadership and 90 percent of pre-university level schools
report having a functioning board but de facto responsibility for processes/procedures remains to be
transferred. At the higher education level, reforms have also taken place, albeit at a slower pace. The
higher education law was revised and is currently being implemented. All universities have established
an external governing board and about 70 percent of the universities have developed strategic plans. The
Government is currently carrying out discussions on curriculum reform and developing an action plan to
implement the Bologna process. In addition, consideration is being given to the development of incentive
schemes to attract students and provide resources in areas where skills are lacking.
36.
Albania continues to lag behind other countries in the region as well as other lower middle
income countries worldwide with respect to health outcomes. Health care also remains a critical area in
which individual households are affected by corruption, with close to a third of survey respondents
reporting that they have paid a bribe to receive medical attention. Public expenditure on health remains
low (2.7 percent of GDP), but total spending on health care from both public and private sources is
comparable with other lower middle income countries, at about 6.5 percent of GDP. Out-of-pocket
payments currently account for nearly 60 percent of total funding, and the high level of informal
payments leads to serious inequality in access to health care with the poor often foregoing necessary care.
37.
Reforms initiated to improve health care service delivery and financing have not been fully
implemented and serious problems remain with respect to: (i) regional imbalances and unequal access;
(ii) payment system that are unsuited to promoting cost containment or efficient resource use; and
(iii) weak sector management capabilities. The Government has been committed to undertaking reforms
in several areas. Most recently, it launched a broad program to rehabilitate primary care facilities. A
system for continuous medical education and re-licensing of medical staff is being implemented; and the
Ministry of Health has developed clinical practice guidelines for most common diseases which is being
rolled out to primary health care (PHC) providers. In addition, the Government has undertaken initial
steps towards improving resource allocation mechanisms through development of a national
rationalization plan for hospital services. In addition, the Government has begun improving the resource
allocation mechanism from the existing input-based to performance-based by changing the provider
payment systems. Achieving the full impact of these reforms is likely to take several years and will
involve changes in the behavior and incentives of both patients and providers.
38.
Albania’s rapid development has seen dramatic reductions in poverty rates, but there are
emerging poverty traps which need to be addressed and vulnerable groups (especially labor-scarce
households) which require Government support. The country has been slowly reforming its safety nets
into modern, well-targeted and effective social assistance programs. Making progress on these is
becoming increasingly important in terms of fiscal management, because of the large share of these

12

expenditures in the budget and recent expansionary trends, for example, ballooning disability fund
expenditures. The pension system also has significant long-term fiscal deficits and low coverage.
39.
There are significant opportunities to improve targeting and administration of the Albania’s
main social benefits program, Ndihma Ekonomike (NE). The poorest beneficiaries receive only 56
percent of NE transfers, and the benefits amount to only about 14 percent of the beneficiaries’ total pretransfer consumption. There are significant opportunities to improve targeting mechanisms, reduce
discretion and opportunities for abuse. Administrative processes also remain overly cumbersome with the
transaction costs for applicants inflated by numerous documentation requirements which administrators
must cross check with multiple agencies at different levels of public administration. The introduction of
national registry and electronic data bases would significant increase the efficiency of targeting and
administration, and help to reduce system costs. The Government has made improved administration of
social benefits as one of its highest priorities and have already prepared a draft law to introduce targeting
and administrative reforms in NE.
40.
Spending on non-contributory disability benefits is disproportionate to the estimated number of
disabled people. Disability benefits account for more than half of the total social assistance spending.
During 2000-2008, both the number of disability beneficiaries and the level of average disability benefits
increased significantly. An initial diagnostic of the disability program shows that the disability legislation
is scattered, medical eligibility criteria are outdated, and the system in place for assessing disability cases
is open to conflict of interests. Finally, it should be noted that the operational level disconnect among the
institutions that manage different parts of social protection leads to missed opportunities for improved
effectiveness from linking these services.
41.
Finally) Albania’s pension system is not sustainable in the long term A compressed benefit
structure, though redistributive, provides little incentive for people to contribute and/or declare correct
earnings. As a result, a low share of the working age population is contributing to the pension system in
Albania but the pension system has to finance several generations of elderly, most of which have full
pension rights. In addition, roles of pension and social assistance programs are not clearly demarcated. In
rural areas, the pension and social assistance branches of the system have evolved in such a way that rural
pensions have essentially become a social assistance benefit. Rural pensioners pay contributions based on
a flat amount, but a large part of their contribution is paid for by the Government. Sporadic
implementation of the pension indexation rule leads to uncertainty. Pension administration is weak, with
some of the past records still paper-based. The Albanian Government has made reform of the pension
system administration one of its main priorities, but has delayed efforts on the necessary measures owing
to the need for a broad-based and multiparty consensus. Meanwhile, efforts are underway to improve
administration, including the introduction of new archive and information systems.

F.

Strengthening Water Resource Management and Adapting to Climate Change

42.
Albania is well endowed with water resources but its environmental infrastructure is lagging
behind other countries in the region and hydrological institutions are weak. Insufficient understanding
of the central role that water resources and the interconnections between various water uses play in the
economy has contributed to systematic underfunding and weakening of the institutions in water resources
management. Albania also shares a number of its rivers and lakes with neighboring countries, making it
imperative that effective regional institutions are established to ensure their adequate management.
Upstream soil erosion and downstream sedimentation are already of increasing concern, with
43.
their attendant impact on the quality of coastal waters and Albania’s tourism potential. This erosion
and sedimentation is evident in abandoned (uncultivated) and arable lands, forests and pasture lands in
the coastal area but also along river beds and in river deltas. This is caused by illegal logging,

13

overgrazing and extraction of gravel resources without any regulation. Millions of tons of sediments are
deposited in rivers and washed away into the Adriatic Sea every year. Forests and water catchments in
mountainous regions face increasing pressures from erosion, illegal logging, and development, but local
capacity to manage resources is limited. Lack of critical environmental infrastructure and services in the
southern coast of Albania also exacerbate the risks of damaging natural resources in light of the expected
tourism development.
44.
The impact of climate change on Albania is expected to be severe, with changing weather and
waterflow patterns in different parts of the country. Albania is the second most vulnerable country to
climate change in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, owing to likely increases in the variability of
precipitation and Albania’s steeper topography and its reliance on water for energy and agriculture.
Climate change predictions suggest that Albania is becoming hotter and drier, with more frequent
droughts and extreme rainfalls. Increased variability and intensity of rainfall is expected to raise
uncertainty and economic risk to farmers, water managers, energy producers, manufacturers, transport
managers and tourism operators. Such hydrological variability also increases risks for natural disasters
from flooding, erosion and landslides.

Recent changes in weather patterns, which are leading to an increased incidence of flooding
throughout the country and a disastrousflood in northern Albania in January 2010, have sharpened
the authorities focus on the more immediate impacts of the changing climate. Albania’s flood
protection infrastructure was built for much less extreme climate scenarios than have been recently
experienced, meanwhile the institutional set-up for coordinated management of surface water flows does
not function effectively. Given the extent of agricultural and urban investments in lowland areas, the
economic risks of weak preparedness are quite high. In general, Albania’s predictive and response
capacities for natural disasters, which include earthquakes as well, are limited and fiscal resources are
strained. Its hydro-meteorological and weather forecasting services lag behind the region and there is no
existing early warning system.
45.

46.
Albania’s high dependence on its water resources -for hydropower production and irrigation
for the important agriculture sector, as well as household uses - makes it imperative to address this
climate challenge in a comprehensive and integrated manner. Albania’s hydropower dams produce
90 percent of domestically sourced power, but institutional, monitoring, and infrastructure deficiencies
leave room for improved efficiency in water use and management. The Government’s ongoing efforts to
further develop its untapped hydropower potential in both small and large plants will have to be carefully
considered so as to also preserve water use rights for other purposes. The irrigation sector, by far the
largest water user, accounting for over 70 percent of all abstractions, has also suffered from insufficient
funding and an inadequate management framework that have led to the deterioration of infrastructure and
unreliable water delivery. Many agricultural reservoirs cannot be operated at their full storage level,
reducing their functionality for flood protection. Erosion in upland areas and sedimentation have reduced
storage capacities significantly, and farmers are increasingly installing wells without much consideration
for competing demands on groundwater. Expanding access for municipal water supplies competes with
the same ground and surface water as irrigation and hydropower, with the added problem of requiring
strong environmental measures to protect water quality.
47.
Albania’s urban water supply sector also remains grossly inefficient, with unaccounted-for
water at 73percent while the average city supplies only 12 hours per day of drinking water. Moreover,
the compliance with established microbiological standards is consistently low. The country has only one
functional waste water treatment plant - several more are under construction - and environmental
protection of water sources and coastal waters is sporadic. Ground and surface water which constitutes
the main source of drinking water is at risk of pollution as a result of the discharge of untreated sewage
waters into rivers and the sea, and inappropriate dumping of solid waste on river banks. The Government

14

has recently decentralized the management of Albania’s 52 municipal water utilities to local governments,
but still provides significant levels of subsidies to the sector. A number of experiments have been
undertaken with private participation without much success to date owing mainly to the small size of the
utilities. Having indicated to external donors that this sector should be a major focus of infrastructure
support going forward, the Government is preparing a large coordinated program of reform, investments
and capacity building in this sector, with one priority being to make rapid progress toward EU standards.
48.
Albania’s challenge will be to move promptly to understand and adapt its infrastructure and
usage to better manage, conserve and make more efficient use of its water resources. Albania’s large
water infrastructure pool provides an excellent foundation to address water resources management.
Some work is already ongoing on the development of better hydrological models for the major rivers and
trans-boundary lakes, improvements in dam safety, reservoir and hydropower management, on new and
improved irrigation techniques, and on defining a large investment program to improve municipal water
supply and sanitation. However, to make best use of its opportunities for adaptation, a multi-sectoral
effort is required with the attendant coordination across government (central and local) and end users.

IV. ONGOING PROGRAM AND KEY LESSONS
49.
The Bank has had an active program in Albania for nearly two decades and a number of lessons
have been learned over that period. The lessons have been divided into three main areas: (i) lessons from
implementation of the current portfolio; (ii) broader lessons derived from a formal review of the last CAS
for the period FY06-FY09 and the 2010 Client Survey; and (iii) lessons learned from engagement with
other partners, both external development partners and domestic stakeholders.
A.

The Current Portfolio and Implementation Lessons

50.
Commitments under the current portfolio include US$263 million in IBRD/IDA loans and
credits, US$l80 million in co-financing loans and credits, and US$35 million of recipient-executed Trust
Funds (TF), amounting to a consolidated portfolio (under Bank supervision) of around US$480 million of
investments under implementation’. About 40 percent of this consolidated portfolio is disbursed, with
approximately equal disbursement ratios for Bank and TF financing. Portfolio performance has
deteriorated over the last couple of years. At the end of May 20 10, 10 of the 16 operations - including the
IPS Multi-Donor Trust Fund, which is treated like a project on account of its size - had satisfactory or
moderately satisfactory implementation performance. Two roads projects are rated highly satisfactory
given their very rapid disbursement rates and good results to date. The average age of the portfolio is 4.5
years. The disbursement ratio in FY09 was 2 1 percent, and by end May 20 10 was 15.3 percent for FY 10.
5 1.
The main challenges ahead for the portfolio are to: (a) improve the implementationperformance
and disbursement rates, which are still notably lower than the regional and Bank-wide averages; (b)
achieve a better balance of risks and development returns across the portfolio; and (c) consolidate and
simpliJLthe large portfolio into a more streamlined and manageable program of interventions.
52.
The recent decline of implementationperformance and disbursement rates can be attributed to
three main factors. First, the process of mainstreaming project implementation arrangements into line
ministry structures which was begun at the Government’s request in 2004 and applied rigorously to new
projects during the last CAS period. This mainstreaming involved a steep learning curve for a number of
ministries, although benefits become evident after the first years of implementation. Second, persistent
fiduciary challenges - both in procurement and financial management - have continued to hamper project

investment numbers.

implementation. Finally, during the CAS period, the program saw a lengthy suspension of one project
and several major project restructurings resulting from concerns about implementation of safeguard
policies. Three of these restructurings are expected to be reflected in upgraded ratings in the next few
weeks, and another in the next few months.

Both the Bank and Government are committed to continue the process of mainstreaming
implementation into government structures under the new CPS. Mainstreaming is fully in line with the
Paris Declaration and sets the stage for enhanced sector-wide approaches for development aid. One key
lesson from the previous CAS is that the approach to this mainstreaming should not be “one-size fits all”
nor aim simply for the elimination of external project implementation units (PIUS). Mainstreaming can
make projects more vulnerable to the high staff turnover levels in government. As such, one way to
mitigate the effect of individual staff replacements is to build a broad-based awareness about, and
engagement with, the project across a wider range of ministry personnel. The mainstreaming and
capacity building agenda should be: (i) carefully planned at project design to take into account the
specific challenges of the beneficiary ministry administration; (ii) explicitly targeted in project outcomes;
and (iii) explicitly addressed in the project risk framework for the likely impact on disbursements in early
years, and for the vulnerability to staff turnover.

With respect to the fiduciary aspects of the portfolio, the FY 10 Country Portfolio Fiduciary
Review (CPFR) noted some progress on both financial management and procurement, and identified a
series of measures to be undertaken under this CPS. Albania remains a high risk country for
procurement, as reflected in the still comparatively high level of bribes reported by firms paid to receive
public contracts, as share of contract value. The 2008 BEEPS showed a reduction in this indicator from
6.7 percent to 4.4 percent, while the region averages 1.5 percent. However, the FY 10 CPFR did not find
any major issues on procurement in Bank projects. The Review attributes this to the heightened
supervision made possible by Bank decentralization of fiduciary staff, which has been relatively
successful in helping to mitigate the risks in the portfolio as well as building capacity in government.
The Report also recommends expanding the use of already acceptable elements of the country system,
while seeking to strengthen others. For example, the Bank is already supporting an audit of Albania’s eprocurement system with a view to certifying it for use by several development partners in the future. In
the area of financial management, the delayed rollout of the Government’s new treasury system did
complicate financial management for a few projects that were mandated to use this system during the last
CAS period. However, the rollout is now fully underway, supported by the IPS Trust Fund, and is
expected to yield a significant improvement in financial management of the portfolio.
55.
Drawing from the lessons from the current CPS and also from the CPFR, the Bank will work
closely with the Government to implement the Fiduciary Action Plan to mitigate and manage fiduciary
risks for investment lending problem projects, contract management, audit compliance, and financial
management and procurement practices by the implementing entities. Maintaining decentralized
financial management and procurement staff 2s essential to cost efficiently sustain the intensive
fiduciary supervision of the Albania portfolio, mitigate high procurement risks, and facilitate portfolio
management closer to the client.

56.
With respect to the balance of portfolio risks and development returns, two key lessons emerged
from the recent Inspection Panel cases. The first is that combination of weak property rights and
widespread illegal construction in Albania pose important risks for a portfolio that supports both a
substantial volume of infrastructure investments, and other institutional reforms, such as land use
planning that attempt to address often highly politicized territorial management issues (see Box 2). With
respect to infrastructure investments, the Bank has undertaken a close review of the portfolio from the
perspective of these safeguard risks and is following up on the recommendations for better training of
staff and client officials on Bank policies and better understanding of local laws and procedures by Bank
staff. A training program for local staff has already been completed. The Bank has also already prepared
a review of Albania’s land acquisition policies in order to identify the gaps with Bank policy. This will
be the basis for a training workshop for government officials in early FY 11. The second lesson relates to
the quality of stakeholder engagement in project design and implementation. As a result, the Albania
program has instituted a Country Office Communications Strategy that is revised biennially and includes
closer supervision of Operational Communications, greater interaction with non-governmental
stakeholders, and timely responses to complaints and inquiries from the public on Bank-financed
operations.
57.
With the graduation to IBRLl, both the Government and the Bank agree on the need to
consolidate the number of smallprojects in the portfolio. Such consolidation will be important to make
more efficient use of the Bank’s resources and Government managerial capacities, free up needed internal
resources for more analytical and advisory work with the Government on Albania’s emerging challenges,
and allow the Bank to selectively focus on the development of larger, coordinated donor programs over
time. The aim is to continue a reduction in the portfolio from 21 projects in 2004, 15 in 2010, to 10-11
by the end of the new CPS period.

17

B.

Lessons from the FY06-FY09 CAS Completion Report and 2010 Client Survey

58.
The implementation of the FYO6-09 CAS yielded important lessons in terms of the Bank’s
effectiveness in supporting Albania’s development process. In particular, there are key lessons
pertaining to the benefits of a close coordination between the Bank and IFC on lending and investment as
well as on advisory services, the efficacy of maintaining a development policy dialogue notwithstanding
the macroeconomic performance, lessons on safeguards implementation and on the Bank’s role in
engendering transparency and consultation.
Close coordination between the Bank and IFC can yield the right combination for complex
private sector reforms, as seen in the privatization of the electricity distribution company.
The cooperation between the IFC and the Bank proved critical in achieving donor community
consensus on major regulatory issues and in structuring an attractive transaction for the
private sector. The IBRD partial risk guarantee (PRG), a financial instrument designed to
help governments mitigate political and regulatory risks, helped to maintain and increase
investors’ interest in the privatization process. The concessions reforms which the Bank
supported through policy based lending coupled with IFC’s assistance to drafting the new
concession law, opened the way to IFC’s advisory services new transactions using the law.
Also, licensing reform supported under a Bank project with IFC technical leadership and the
Doing Business innovations supported by the joint Bank-IFC unit were two other important
areas of successful, close cooperation between the Bank and IFC.
Important reform and structural progress can be made even without budget support, if
there is strong ownership by the Government of the underlying reform program. During
the previous CAS period, the Bank and Government maintained a continuous policy dialogue
which yielded key structural reforms, notwithstanding the eventual outcome that the DPL
series was curtailed at only the first operation, because of concerns about the macroeconomic
framework.
Safeguards policy implementation need to be prioritized to the same degree as fiduciary
controls in project preparation and implementation. First, both task teams and the client

18

need to have a better command of the policies and how to implement them. Second, staff
responsible for reviewing safeguard policy frameworks (e.g. Resettlement Policy Framework
and Environmental Management Plans) needs to have a good understanding of local laws and
procedures, and their specific inconsistencies or gaps vis a vis Bank policies. Finally, the
Bank needs to ensure that application of these policies is consistent across projects, sectors
and countries, by ensuring that social development specialists, country legal teams and
quality assurance staff have a common understanding of how the policy should be applied in
different types of cases.
The Bank has played an important role in engendering transparency and consultation in
Albania, through its own actions and those related to portfolio implementation. Under the
previous CAS period, closer Bank supervision of consultations already yielded important,
albeit subtle, changes in the culture of consultation in the Albanian public service. Second,
under the Inspection Panel cases, the Bank learned important and very public lessons about
the need to keep communication lines open with the media and the general public, but also
about how important it is that all stakeholders - general public, project beneficiaries, civil
society, Parliament, government - have a deeper understanding of the way the Bank works in
Albania. Third, civil society continues to look to the Bank and other international partners
for an independent voice on key development issues.
In 2009/10, a client survey about opinion leaders’ views of the World Bank and its work in
59.
Albania found relatively strong support for the Bank’s role. Two hundred stakeholders - drawn from a
range of opinion leaders in Albania, including government, civil society, media, private sector, and
academia -- responded to the survey, a 73 percent response rate. Overall results suggest that stakeholders
are quite satisfied with the Bank’s work in Albania, their relationships with the Bank, the Bank’s
relevance in Albania, its alignment with country development priorities, and the effectiveness of Bank
interventions. Just over half of respondents indicated that the Bank should be more involved in Albania’s
development strategies, while 44 percent said that the Bank was currently involved at an optimum level.
The Bank is perceived by respondents to be focused on the areas that respondents consider top priorities.
Stakeholders are concerned deeply with issues related to law, justice and governance. Survey findings
suggest that the Bank’s overall strategic focus in Albania (identified by respondents as primarily poverty,
growth, government effectiveness, and infrastructure) is fairly well aligned with what stakeholders think
the Bank should be focused on in Albania (growth, property rights, education, governance). With respect
to areas for improvement the most notable findings included consistent suggestions that: (i) the Bank
should work more with local government and the private sector; and (ii) the Bank should go much further
in publicly disclosing the details of its work with Government.
C.

Partnerships and Participation

60.
Donor partnerships. The WBG continues to be the second largest donor to Albania after
European Commission (EC) in terms of disbursements, with around US$60 million per year (see Annex
7). This position has allowed the Bank Group to help the Government coordinate donor assistance and
mobilizing financing for key sector programs, with considerable success. A significant share of the
commitments in the current Bank portfolio is co-financed with other partners, at a ratio of 0.8 in cofinancing to each dollar of Bank-financing, i.e. around $215 million in co- or parallel-financing for
around $260 million in IDMBRD loans and credits. This includes one sector wide approach, the
Education Excellence and Equity Project which has a ratio of 2.5 for each dollar of Bank financing.
Notably, the Secondary and Local Roads Project of US$20 million from IDA and $15 million cofinancing from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Fund has been the
centerpiece of a program of parallelfinancing for feeder roads reconstruction of around US$430 million.
The Bank is also managing a US$6 million Multi-Donor Trust Fund for a group of seven donors, and an

19

innovative fee-based service arrangement with Albania’s One UN program. Most recently, through the
use of the Partial Risk Guarantee instrument for the privatization of the distribution company, the Bank
has already supported private investment commitments for electricity sector at an expected ratio of
approximately 3.2 for each dollar of the guarantee. IFC has also been successful in mobilizing support
from among a wide range of development partners for its advisory services and technical assistance.
61.
Going forward, the Bank and IFC should continue to explore with the Government innovative
ways of crowding-in private development financing for key areas, in particular for private participation in
infrastructure where Albania needs large amount of investments and climate adaptation considering
country’s high exposure to climate change. The WBG will pursue on these areas while ensuring that
partnering opportunities and arrangements do not overstretch internal resources for high quality
preparation and supervision, and have clear synergies with the Bank overall program. Moreover, as the
EC continues to increase its support to Albania it will be critical to further expand and deepen the Bank’s
cooperation with the EC and Government to ensure that the Bank’s global knowledge can continue to
inform Albania’s development efforts.
62.
Stakeholder participation. Under the FY06-09 CAS, the Governance Filter, inter alia,
emphasized the demand side of good governance, particularly mechanisms for advocacy and increased
citizen involvement to encourage better public service delivery. The participatory approach worked
particularly well in those projects that supported local services and which engaged beneficiary
participation in social service delivery, irrigation, community works, forestry, coastal village and
municipal infrastructure, secondary and local roads. Given this experience, the Bank should consider
means of further deepening its engagement with non-governmental and civil society groups in the
implementation of its program in Albania. This will not only help to build awareness around Bankfinanced programs in Albania and support the rollout of the Bank’s new Access to Information Policy, but
perhaps demonstrate good practices for the Government in ways of effectively engaging civil society in
monitoring and evaluating public programs and projects.

V. THE ALBANIA-BANK GROUP COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM
A.

Drivers of the CPS Program

63.
The main driver of the FYll-14 CPS is the Government’s development strategy as articulated
in the NSDI and the accompanying External Assistance Orientation Document (EAOD). The latter
document, prepared by the Government in April 2008, provides development partners guidance on
focusing assistance in support of the NSDI. Specifically, the EAOD calls for a greater use of
programmatic approaches in development assistance and an added focus by development partners on
water, environment, health and property sectors. It identifies a clear role for multilateral lenders and the
challenges of IDA graduation:
“Multilateral loans are currently playing a very important role in Albania. This is especially the
case in the areas that do not traditionally receive EU support, such as health, education and
social reform, but also in infrastructure and natural resources. The graduation from IDA status
means that the subsidy element of the loans is now less than 20%. However, multilateral loans
are extremely important for Albania as the WB and other multilaterals are able to provide
important expertise to complement their funding and because many of these investments
provide social returns only in the long term.”

20

64.
The EAOD identifies key areas in which it encourages partners to maintain or increase
assistance and others in which it would prefer to work using principally domestic public or private
resources. In this regard, it seeks to maintain the levels of external assistance in: (i) public
administratiodrule of law, but with a stronger focus on justice and public order; (ii) economic
development reforms “but with a common national approach that reflects EU norms [which] IPA should
play a role in defining”; (iii) social services where the Document calls for the “World Bank to continue its
leadership and build on the sector wide approach (SWAP) that has been started in education”; and (iv)
infrastructure, but with an increasing share to water supply and sanitation, and associated environmental
management. In infrastructure, the priorities include “completing the national and rural road networks,
road safety, energy efficiency, management reform in the water and sanitation at the local level along
with related investments in physical assets, and building effective environmental institutions.”

65.
The Government has recently also requested the Bank to reorient the focus of Bankfinancing
towards supporting the fiscal challenges facing Albania over the short to medium term. Specifically,
the authorities have instructed line ministries that Bank financing should be fully integrated into the
Government’s medium term budget framework and planned within, rather than in addition to, budget
ceilings. This request reflects the authorities’ acute awareness that Albania’s graduation to IBRD only
lending - and the accompanying trend of other partners to less concessional financing terms - requires
more careful macro management of its development financing options. The Ministry of Finance noted
explicitly that “IBRD funds received from the WB through CPS are at more appropriate terms than those
found in the financial markets” and that their inclusion within the national budget program would not
only facilitate better long term integrated planning of Albania’s development expenditures, but also
encourage other donors in pursuit of this principle of the Paris Declaration. The Minister has also called
on all development partners to focus over the next few years on accelerating the implementation of
Albania’s substantial ongoing donor financed program to help ease fiscal constraints while maintaining
critical investments for long term growth and poverty reduction.

21

66.
CPS consultations were held with a broad range of stakeholders - - namely, Parliament
including the opposition members, the Bank of Albania, representatives of private sector and civil
society, donors and as well as government officials. The main feedback from the Parliamentary
Commission on Economy and Finance was related to the design of conditionality for budget support
which Commission Members felt should be limited to a few high priority issues. In addition, several
members suggested that the Bank focus in depth on macroeconomic policy (particularly in the absence of
a Fund program and local presence) and regularly publish analytic reviews on macroeconomic
performance. The need for a more focused and consolidated World Bank Group program was another
theme emphasized by Commission Members, who expressed concerns about the rate of project
implementation. Donors welcomed the Bank’s continued efforts to partner with other financiers, and
invited the Bank to join in the EU-European bilateral donors division of labor initiative. They also urged
the Bank Group to take on a larger role in addressing the informal economy and helping to raise private
sector capacity. Civil society continued to request that the Bank foster more public debate on
macroeconomic and broader development issues. In addition, the representatives suggested a more
cross-sectoral focus in addressing key challenges, e.g. the impact of transport on school enrolment or the
role of forestry management on mountain area poverty.

67.
Integration with the European accession agenda. On April 14,2010 the Government submitted
Albania’s response to the EC pre-accession questionnaire as the next step in the candidacy process. EUrelated reforms are expected to receive greater attention over the next few years, and the Bank has been
providing relevant assistance where appropriate. However, the Government has thus far based its
dialogue with the Bank on the Bank’s competitive and comparative advantages, rather than on harnessing
Bank expertise in pursuing EU integration-related reforms. However, supporting Albania’s EU agenda is
expected to become a stronger priority, particularly after the results of the EU pre-accession questionnaire
are published (likely in early 201 1). The Bank will follow these developments closely and be prepared to
further engage on important EU reforms, particularly in governance, PFM, and fiduciary matters, as well
as in the central areas of the CPS program. Meanwhile, project teams will work to ensure that they are
fully familiar with EU requirements, and integrate them as much as possible into lending activities.
68.
Going forward, the ECA region is looking to deepen and broaden its partnership with the
European Commission. The two institutions are already exploring greater interactions on country sector
wide programs, but also on regional projects, building on the successful collaboration already seen in the
Energy Community of South East Europe (ECSEE) and the South East Europe Transport Observatory
(SEETO). In particular, for the Albania CPS program, the Bank will actively seek out areas for joint
programming with the Commission, to more effectively support Albania’s progress on the accession path.

B.

Overview of Country Partnership Strategy

69.
As noted earlier, Albania enters the new CPS period having weathered the globalfkancial and
economic crisis reasonably well; maintaining positive, albeit significantly reduced, growth rates in
2009 and a sound banking sector. Given the slower recovery in Europe and difficulties in Greece - a
major economic partner for trade, investment and remittances - the next few years are likely to be less
favorable than in the recent past. The key challenges to resuming high growth in this environment
include: (i) the early resumption of a sound medium term fiscaI framework and further strengthening of
public expenditure management; (ii) improving the implementation of Albania’s already broad program
of regulatory reforms to boost competitiveness and investment levels; (iii) continuing to close the
infrastructure gap in a fiscally sustainable manner, and (iv) deepening the private sector’s access to credit.
Meanwhile, the slow recovery is likely to take its toll on the most vulnerable necessitating a renewed
attention to improving the effectiveness of social protection systems and safeguarding progress on social
indicators. Finally, Albania is rapidly coming to terms with its climate change challenge - as the second

22

most vulnerable country in Europe and Central Asia - primarily relating to the management of its water
resources on which the country is heavily dependent for energy and agriculture.
70.
The joint Bank Group program presented in this CPS will help Albania to meet the
abovementioned challenges, byfocusing on three strategic objectives:

(0

Accelerating the recovery in Albania’s economic growth through improved competitiveness
by strengthening macroeconomic and public expenditure management, improving business
regulations and reducing compliance costs, supporting local banks and competitive local
companies, and improving key infrastructure services and their financial sustainability.

(ii) Broadening and sustaining Albania’s social gains by improving access to better quality
education and health services, and increasing the effectiveness of its social protection systems
(iii) Reducing Albania’s vulnerability to climate change, by improving the conservation,
management and efficient use of its water resources, and strengthening disaster preparedness.
71.
This CPS continues the “one-World Bank Group” approach initiated under Albania previous
joint CAS, and aims at an even more focused, synergistic program. Coordinated IBRD-IFC
engagements are targeted in the following priority sectors: (i) national infrastructure - energy and roads;
and (ii) municipal infrastructure, mainly water supply and solid waste management; and (iii) the business
environment.
72.
In addition, the CPS program also reflects a deepening sub-regional focus in the Western
Balkans and South East Europe. Already Albania has and is benefiting from projects in the regional
Trade and Transport Facilitation in South East Europe program and the Energy Community of South East
Europe. During this CPS period, the Bank expects to expand and further develop the Catastrophe Risk
Insurance Facility, of which Albania is a founding member. In addition, Albania will continue to benefit
from a move towards regional economic and sector work (ESW) as a means of utilizing available World
Bank resources for knowledge generation more efficiently. Key areas in this regard include poverty
analysis, social policy, transport, water, climate change and financial sector. Going forward, new
priorities could be added, based on client demand and the amenability of the topichector to a regional
rather than a country approach.

73.
The CPS program will also continue to support governance improvements in Albania by
refining the Governance Filter (initially developed under the FY06-09 CAS) to focus on a clear set of
requirements for Bank-financed projects aimed at deepening the impact on the public expenditure
management, administrative efficiency, fiduciary and public disclosure practices across government
ministries.
74.
The main approach of the CPS will be to focus on improving and accelerating the
implementation of the large ongoing portfolio of Bank-financed projects in Albania, which are already
addressing the country’s key challenges, while selectively adding new projects, in a reduced number of
critical sectors. This focus on the existing portfolio is needed in order to deliver the expected results and
development impact, while improving the pace of resource transfer to the Government as it faces new
fiscal constraints. An important part of this first approach will be to further integrate Bank-financed
programs into the budget and administrative framework of government so as to yield added benefits in
terms of public expenditure management, fiduciary and administrative capacities.
75.
This lending strategy also aims to complete the consolidation of the investment portfolio to 1012 operations by FYI4 (from 21 projects in FY04). The consolidation strategy reflects a Government’s
request for the Bank to focus on fewer, larger projects and to continue to mobilizing large coordinated
donor programs in key development areas. The move to consolidate the portfolio also reflects the need

23

for a more efficient use of the Bank’s resources and Government managerial capacities for supporting the
Albania program, and to free up needed internal Bank resources for more analytical and advisory work
with Government on Albania’s emerging challenges. Meanwhile the Bank and IFC will support
regulatory reform aimed at improve the prospects for raising private sector financing for key
infrastructure bottlenecks.

Strategic Objectives and Results

76.
The objective of the CPS is to support Albania’s development through three strategic objectives
and continuing the use of a cross-cutting Governance Filter. The strategic objectives include: (i)
accelerating Albania’s recovery to high growth in a post-crisis Europe; (ii) broadening and sustaining
Albania’s social gains; (iii) reducing Albania’s vulnerability to climate change. Details on the nature of
each strategic objective, including principal ongoing and proposed instruments, are described below.

(i) Sound macroeconomic management and improved public expenditure management
77.
The Bank will support Government’s efforts to strengthen its macro - especially fiscal performance and public expenditure management. Bank support would be provided principally through a
series of policy-based loans together with a range of ongoing and new analytical and advisory services,
and followed by a planned Public Sector Reform project in FY 14. The main focus of this support would
be to help Albania: (a) improve the credibility and contestability of fiscal policy; (b) complete the
framework for safeguarding financial sector stability; (c) continue improvements in public expenditure

24

management and fiduciary performance; and (d) deepen the possibilities for citizen engagement with
public policy-making.
78.
The proposed Social Services (FY 11) and Growth (FY 12-FY14) Development Policy Loans
(DPL) of $25 million each would address, inter alia, reforms in fiscal policy and public expenditure,
including improving the efficiency of social expenditures (Social Services DPL) and establishment of a
fiscal rule or equivalent anchor to entrench prudent fiscal policy (Growth DPLs).
79.
Efforts to improve the credibility and contestability of fiscal policy would center around: (a) the
Bank’s renewed engagement in a transparent and public dialogue on fiscal policy and (b) the deepening of
the Bank’s involvement in the monitoring and analysis of sectoral expenditure patterns and outcomes as
part of its project portfolio management. The former would start with the dissemination of the recently
completed Country Economic Memorandum (CEM, followed by the Bank publication of quarterly
economic reviews analyzing macroeconomic developments. These reports would be critical given the
absence of an IMF program, but even if one were adopted the reports could continue to support more
detailed debates on public expenditure policy - at both the structural and sectoral levels. The sectoral
analyses would require the Bank’s macroeconomic and sector teams to undertake some public
expenditure and institutional analyses as part of project preparation of supervision in key ministries.
These analyses would support greater integration of Bank-financed projects into the medium-term budget
planning (MTBP) as well as provide additional analytical basis for the Government’s annual budget
review process.
80.
Efforts to improve public expenditure management systems would be based primarily in the
ongoing Integrated Planning System Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF), which has already enabled
Albania to further improve its MTBP processes with links to the national strategy. This grant is also
supporting: (i) the Treasury systems rollout; (ii) development of an Albania Financial Management
Information System (AMFIS) to link the monitoring of development outcomes with budget execution;
and potentially (iii) some capacity building for the Institute of National Statistics, in particular, on the
production of national accounts. Analytical work to take stock of developments and future needs would
include a new Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) in FY123 and updates of the
Report on the Observations of Standards and Codes (ROSCs) on Fiscal Transparency and Data Quality
Assessment Framework, in conjunction with the IMF.
81.
In terms of the governance of public spending, Albania has already made progress in public
procurement and financial management leading to the use of some national systems by the Bank.
Additional support will be provided under the ongoing Governance Partnership Facility (GPF) Grant for
further development of the procurement and financial management systems (see Box 3 , below). The
rollout of the Treasury systems and AFMIS will play an important role in strengthening capacities for
improved budget reporting, cash accounting and financial management, meanwhile reforms related to
internal audit and control are fully supported under the EU Instrument for Pre-Accession program.
(ii) Improved business regulations and reduced compliance costs for the private sector

82.
Albania has taken major steps to upgrade the framework for private investment through a broad
program of regulatory reform, but significant gaps remain between new regulations and their
implementation in practice as evidenced by persistently high “time tax” reported in the recent BEEPS and
ICA. The strategicfocus for the Bank Group under this CPS will be complete ongoing reforms related
to land administration and business inspections aimed at reducing the “time tax”, and to put in place a
modern systemfor better preparation of regulatory reforms prior to their adoption.
The last PEFA for Albania was prepared in 2006.

25

83.
The ongoing Business Environment Reform and Institutional Strengthening Project (BERIS) is
supporting the introduction of a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) tool and the reform of Albania’s
framework for business inspections, while the ongoing Land Administration and Management Project
(LAMP) is financing the modernization of the Immovable Property Rights Office and the registration of
75 percent of unregistered urban properties. The main activities are complemented by a Doing Business
Reform Initiative for South East Europe, and by IFC s Tax SimpIlJication Project, Subnational
CompetitivenessProgram and Trade Logistics Program.
84.
The CPS program will also continue implementation of a range of smaller programs aimed at
strengthening private sector capacitiesfor complying with EU and international requirements. These
include:

A planned Regional Program for Accounting Reform and Institutional Standards (REPARIS)
Corporate Reporting Enhancement Project aimed at strengthening the corporate sector
financial reporting in line with EU and international requirements; and complemented by
IFC ’s Corporate Governanceprogram which provides direct assistance to local enterprises to
improve their internal governance arrangements;
The BERISproject which is also supporting an upgrade of Albania’s metrology and technical
standards infrastructure, and is complemented by an IFC program on International Standards
and Technical Regulations which provides direct assistance to small businesses in complying
with technical standards;
An Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative trust fund supporting the internationally

recognized participatory framework for revenue transparency in the mining sector, supported
by IFC investments in the growing mining sector; and
An Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant supporting implementation of the UN Aarhus

Convention on transparency and participation in environmental permitting and decision
making.
(iii) Improved, and more financially sustainable, infrastructure services in roads, energy, and
irrigation

85.
Given fiscal constraints and limited Bank resources, the CPS strategy under this objective is to
(a) consolidate current reforms and complete ongoing investments in the energy and road sectors,
while working to gradually crowd in new and private financing mechanisms, where possible, and (b)
and continue investments in the irrigation system. The Government’s request for a gradual shift toward
municipal water supply will be addressed under the Strategic Objective 3 on reducing Albania’s
vulnerability to climate change through improvement management, conservation and more efficient use
of its water resources.
86.
In the energy sector, the CPS will focus on consolidating results from the large ongoing portfolio
which includes four Bank projects and two IFC programs. On the Bank side, the ongoing (i) Power
Sector Generation and Reconstruction Project is expected to achieve, shortly, the commercial operations
of the new Vlora Thermal Power Plant to provide an additional 700 GWh in diversified electricity
generation capacity for Albania; (ii) the ECSEE Adaptable Program Loan (APL) 2 Transmission Project
is financing the replacement of three aging substations critical to improving the quality, reliability and
efficiency of the bulk power transmission system and building capacity in the newly unbundled
Transmission System Operator; and (iii) the ECSEE APL 5 Dam Safety Project is supporting efficiency
improvements on Albania’s largest hydropower cascade, and helping to spur private investment in
hydropower. In addition, the recently approved Partial Risk Guarantee for the privatized electricity

26

distribution company remains critical to ensuring regulatory stability in this sector and facilitated critical
investments by the new operator.
87.
Meanwhile IFC will continue the ongoing Residential Energy Eflciency Performance-Based
Grant Initiative aimed at leveraging up to 7,000 micro loans of around $28 million for energy efficiency
improvements by households with a target of 24,500 megawatt-hours of energy savings and up to 30,000
tons per year of greenhouse gases (GHG) avoided by FY12. IFC is also embarking on a Renewable
Energy Program for Small Hydro Power Plants to improve existing regulatory framework, provide
capacity development to investors and work with selected financial institutions to strengthen the supply of
project financing for small hydropower plants. Where possible, following on recent successful
privatizations in the sector, IFC will consider support for power distribution and power generation private
companies,
In the transport sector, the CPS will focus on completion of two ongoing projects: the Transport
88.
Project which is financing construction of the new Milot-Rreshen section of the road to Kosovo and the
Secondary and Local Roads Project which underpins the Government?s ongoing $430 million Secondary
and Tertiary Roads program. After this, the Bank Group will support the institutional development and
capacity building for the maintenance of the national road network. Indeed, the ongoing Transport
Project is also piloting the use of performance-based maintenance contracts which should lay the basis for
a planned Road Maintenance and Safety Project in FY 13 to support the creation of coordinated donor
program for completing rehabilitation and establishing routine maintenance for the national road network.
In the same vein, IFC has planned advisory services for a Public Private Partnership for the completion,
maintenance and operation of the new road to Morine on the Kosovo border. IFC will continue to
encourage the government to attract private sector investments in ports through PPPs and concessions.
Where possible, IFC will support private sector financing for projects in the transportation sector
following privatization.
89.
The planned Water Resources and Irrigation Project (FY 11) will build on the lessons of past
investments in irrigation, where still one-third of the national network remains in need of rehabilitation, to
also address upstream safety and efficiency of irrigation reservoirs, introduce more efficient water
distribution mechanisms and consolidate recent reforms in irrigation system management and cost
recovery.
(iv) Supporting banks and competitive companies

90.
Given the global financial crisis, IFC will increase its support for the banking sector with a
focus on broadening access to finance, especially for MSMEs. IFC will provide a wide variety of products
tailored to needs of local banks including credit lines, partial guarantee product, and energy efficiency and
renewable energy products. If needed, IFC will consider support to strengthen banks? capitalization to
facilitate their lending activities to the real sector. In addition, IFC will contribute to strengthening of the
microfinance institutions, addressing the economic disparity between rural/semi-urban and urban
development.
91.
The banks have become more risk-averse and the country has been experiencing a slowdown in
the banks? lending to the local companies. In this environment, one of IFC?s challenges in the country is
to partially ease the impact of the crisis by providing adequate lending products to the local companies.
Since most of the companies in the real sector are MSMEs, IFC will provide its support mainly through
the banking sector. TFC will seek to expand its financing to improve the competitiveness of local
companies in sectors that can successhlly compete with their exports in the regional market. In
addition, IFC will support good regional companies that would like to expand their operations in
Albania.

27

92.
Albania has made good strides on reducing absolute poverty in both urban and rural areas.
However latest results show that there are emerging pockets of persistent poverty. Moreover, in light of
the likely slow recovery toward high growth rates, there are risks that recent gains in poverty may
stagnate. The new CPS includes a continued engagement in broadening access to better quality education
(in particular at the secondary and higher levels, where Albania’s enrolment rates are significantly lower
than regional standards) and health services (where Albania’s outcomes also lags behind its neighbors and
the region). The CPS also refocuses new attention on the effectiveness of Albania’s social protection
services, where there are opportunities to improve targeting and administration.
(i) Broader access to education, particularly secondary and higher education, and improved
quality at all levels
93.
The CPS program will continue to support improvements to education and skills development
through the ongoing Education, Excellence and Equity Project as part of Albania’s first sector-wide
approach program. The program supports improvements in the quality of secondary education aimed at
increasing enrolment, reforming higher education management and financing, and strengthening the
capacity for overall management of the education system. Quality improvements are expected to emerge
from efforts to: (i) improve school management through training, the establishment of school boards and a
school grants program; (ii) construct new and extended school buildings to reduce overcrowding; (iii)
introduce new curricula, textbooks, labs, computers and internet access; and (iv) improve teacher training,
licensing and continuous professional development. Given the depth of the needs to be addressed and the
Government’s expressed demand for the Bank to continue to be engaged in this social sector, a follow-on
Education Project is planned for FY14. However, the scope of this project is expected to be refined over
the next couple years, and its outcomes are expected to be achieved in the next CPS.
(ii) Improved access to quality primary health care and more efficient public spending on
health care
94.
The Bank is already supporting key reforms in the health care sector aimed at increasing access to
quality primary health care services, particularly among the poor, and improving the efficiency of public
spending on health care. Under this CPS, the Bank will continue to support ongoing reforms in the health
care sector through the ongoing Health Sector Modernization Project including: (i) reforming primary
health care provision and financing, including by introducing a Basics Benefit Package and universal
enrolment with family health providers; (ii) improving quality of primary health care services through an
extensive re-training and re-equipping program, equipment for primary health care providers; (iii)
improving the incentives for greater efficiency through performance- and incentive- based contracting;
and (iv) strengthening hospital governance and management. Given the large unfinished agenda in this
area, a follow-on Health Sector Project is planned for FY 14. The outcomes are expected in the next CPS.
(iii) Improved targeting and efficiency in Albania’s social protection systems
95.
The CPS will support continued improvements in social protection through the ongoing Social
Service Deliveg, Project which was extended and restructured to establishment an information system,
undertake administrative improvements and build capacity for pension system reforms; and ongoing

28

analytical work under the Programmatic Poverty Analysis and Advisory Program and the recent
Economic Governance of Utilities United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Fee-Based Service
which is supporting the review and revision of the social protection mechanisms for electricity and water
tariffs.

96.
However, the main focus of the CPS program will be in two planned new operations, a Social
Services Development Policy Loan (FY 11) to be followed by a Social Assistance Investment Project
(FY 12) which would aim to consolidate reforms in social assistance benefit targeting and administration,
supported by the DPL, and consolidate improvements in Albania’s ability as a middle income country to
protect its most poor and vulnerable populations. Proposed reforms include: (i) revising eligibility criteria
and targeting mechanisms for the main social assistance and disability benefits programs; and (ii)
increasing transparency and efficiency in the allocation of social assistance resources.
Strategic Objective 3: Reducing Albania’s virlnerability to climate change
(i) Improved conservation, munagemenfand efficient use of .41bunia’s wuter resources
(iij Decrcused vulnerbili?v to nmural and munmadc di,sastcrs

(i) Improved the conservation, management and efficient use of Albania’s water resources

97.
The CPS program will support Albania in meeting the challenges of climate change by
improving the conservation, management and efficient use of its water resources. The strategy focuses
on building institutions and putting in place investments to improve the efficiency of water resource use
through the ongoing portfolio of five investment projects, while gradually incorporating three new
investments in the areas of integrated water resource management and irrigation, municipal water supply
and sanitation, and environmental services.
98.
The ongoing portfolio includes: (i) Natural Resources Development Project which supports
community-based forest, pasture and micro-catchment conservation planning and investments in over 230
upland and mountainous communities where erosion is prevalent; and is piloting integrated management
of three out of Albania‘s seven watersheds; (ii) a Natural Regeneration Bio-Carbon Trust Fund which is
also piloting the first-ever purchase of carbon-sequestered from natural regeneration that can help to
restore degraded lands, reduce soil erosion, and improve water quality; (iii) Integrated Coastal Zone
Management and Clean- Up Project (ICZMCP) which is supporting environmental infrastructure along
the southern coast, including pollution remediation at a former chemical plant site, water supply and
sanitation upgrades in two coastal municipalities, construction of an EU-compliant solid waste landfill
and the development of a management plan for Albania’s most important Ramsar4 site; (iv) a joint
Albania-Montenegro Lake Shkoder Integrated Ecosystem Management Global Environment Facility
(GEF) Project that is establishing a Bilateral Lake Management framework for this important shared
water resource; and (v) following on its successful recycling and linkages program, proposed IFC
advisory services for private participation in solid waste management, complemented where possible
with financing of concessionaires or direct financing of municipalities for developing regional sanitary
landfills in line with new national legislation and relevant EU Directives.
99.
Two new projects are planned to extend this agenda, under the CPS. The first two: the Municipal
Water Supply Reform & Investment Project (FY 11) will build on the Bank’s previous experience in
watedwastewater sector and respond to the Government’s call for increased donor support in this area.
The project will form the Bank’s main contribution to a donor-wide sector program under preparation by
The “Ramsar”Convention on Wetlands is an intergovernmental treaty that embodies the commitments to maintain
the ecological character of their Wetlands of International Importance.

29

the Government (in conjunction with KFW/GTZ, Austrian Development Corporation and the Bank) and
will focus on a policy reform to be defined jointly with Government for both the national and local levels
and introduce a demand management program in the water sector to facilitate municipal investments by a
wide range of donor partners. In addition, the project will likely support improvements, and possible
private participation in one of Albania’s two largest municipal water systems. Meanwhile LFC is actively
seeking to support through advisory services, private participation in eligible municipal utilities. The
proposed Environmental Services Project (FY 13) will be a follow-up to the Natural Resources
Development and Bio-Carbon projects above and will aim to hrther address upstream erosion and other
degradation issues that impact Albania’s sustainable development. In addition, this project should also be
an avenue for also crowding external private and public resources toward Albania’s efforts at climate
change mitigation and adaptation.
100. Finally, the Water Resources and Irrigation Project (FY 12) described above, is mainly part of the
infrastructure agenda (see paragraph 89) but will also serve this objective of strengthening Albania’s
water resource management framework.

(ii) Decreased vulnerability to natural and man-made disasters
101. The Bank will support Albania’s efforts to strengthen its disaster preparedness, by focusing on
the implementation of the two ongoing projects and the emergency component of another project which
has recently been restructured under to respond to the floods in January. Under the Disaster Risk
Mitigation and Adaptation Project, the Bank is contributing to updating Albania’s disaster response
strategies, improving its weather forecasting services, revising building codes to be EU-compliant for
seismic risks, and establishing the Southeast Europe Catastrophic Risk Insurance Facility which will
promote the provision of disaster and weather risk insurance products in the subregional market. The
Bank will also complete ongoing support under the Avian InJluenza Control and Human Pandemic
Preparedness and Response Project, and complete investments to repair and upgrade damaged flood
protection and other infrastructure in northern Albania under the restructure Land Administration and
Management Project.

D.

The Governance Filter v2.0

102. Under the last CAS, Albania introduced a Governance Filter aimed at mainstreaming a focus
on four key governance areas’ into each and every Bank intervention. The Filter was instrumental in
maintaining the focus on governance issues across the portfolio and in the design of each new project. On
balance, the contribution of the projects to the creation of stronger institutional mechanisms for
governance in individual sectors was substantial, including for example, transparent processes for road
selection, improved licensing of health care providers, blind testing for university entrance and better
supervision of financial institutions (see Annex 2 for more details). This was later reinforced and further
enhanced by the Bank’s Country Governance and Anti-Corruption (CGAC) strategy in 2007. Three key
lessons from the implementation of this Filter and the later CGAC program are (i) the need to strengthen
the analytical basis for efforts on governance; (ii) focus on approaches and interventions that are more
tangible to Government officials (and indeed task teams), i.e. more synergies with the ongoing Banksupported activities and reforms; and (iii) create the space for smaller, more just-in-time interventions as
opportunities arise.

5

The Governance Pillars were (i) increased transparency of public spending; (ii) depoliticization of public
administration and strengthening of independent agencies; (iii) understanding the challenges of local
government; and (iv) greater citizen participation and demand-side mechanisms for good governance.

30

103. These lessons were incorporated into Albania’s proposal for a Window I allocation from the
Bank’s new Governance Partnership Facility (described below in Box 3) and have helped to refine the
focus of the Governance Filter for the new CPS. Albania’s proposal was notable in that the approach to
improving governance is essentially one of working through the portfolio in an effort, not only to improve
implementation of Bank-financed projects, but to effect broader change on the government systems in
which those projects are embedded. The revised approach seeks to capitalize on the potential of Bank
projects to enhance the effectiveness of government bodies by bringing expertise to bear on expenditure
and administrative matters, as a complement sectoral reforms and investments. The Filter specifies
requirements for the lending program related to: (i) public expenditure management; (ii) administrative
arrangement; (iii) use, or partial use of some government fiduciary systems; and (iv) public disclosure and
civil society engagement.
104. First, each project should be fully integrated into the Government’s Medium Term Budget
Program and the preparation of new projects will require teams to undertake public expenditure
analysis of government spending in the key ministry or sector. Projects should demonstrate how they
respond to at least one key public expenditure policy challenge of that sector. During supervision, project
teams will be required to periodically monitor the implementation of the overall sector budget and
performance on the identified public expenditure policy challenge together with the line ministry. Sector
teams will have to liaise and cooperate closely with Poverty Reduction and Economic Management
Network (PREM) colleagues to feed this information into the Bank’s policy dialogue on fiscal
management and public expenditure policy. Overall, such an integration of project preparation and
supervision in the government’s budget processes will help to support, over time, more evidence-based
resource allocation and increased transparency of public expenditure.

105. Second, each new project should undertake a brief administrative review as part of the design
of “mainstreamed” implementation arrangements. This requirement responds to the lessons learned
under the previous CAS. These reviews will help to better identify potential bottlenecks in project
implementation as well as other capacity building goals that the project may address, through
mainstreaming. The Government has already started a process of streamlining the responsibilities for
donor-financed project management in each line ministry into a single department. The Bank will also
support the development of new arrangements, through the projects, wherever possible.

31

106. The third requirement relates to the use, or partial use, of the elements of the country
procurement anlor financial management systems that have been approved by Bank’s Regional
Procurement and Financial Management. Albania has made progress on reforms in public procurement
and financial management. Both these fiduciary systems continue to receive support under the IPS
MDTF and the GPF Fiduciary Action Plan. Notably, the Bank is in the process of auditing Albania’s eprocurement system, which will outline improvements required for Bank and other IF1 certification of the
system. The automated Treasury system and development of the External Assistance Information System
also present the opportunity for full integration of Bank financing into the Government’s financial
management systems. The Bank will continue this support so that, increasingly, projects can move to
using the e-procurement and Treasury systems.

107. Fourth, as a supplement to the Bank’s new Access to Information Policy, new and ongoing
projects will be required to explore mechanisms for involving civil society into the supervision and
monitoring of implementation. A pilot program on such mechanisms is supported by the CGAC-GPF.
108. Expected outcomesfrom the use of the Governance Filter v2.0 in the Albania portfolio relate
mainly to government effectiveness rather than to anti-corruption, per se. One key outcome would be
better public expenditure and financial management in central government, as evidenced by a gradual
improvement in PEFA indicators, particularly those relating to monitoring and reporting on budget
execution and donor financing. A second outcome relates to implementation of the Paris Declaration on
development effectiveness, in particular a reduction in the number of free-standing project
implementation units and greater use of accredited country fiduciary systems, which is monitored by the
Albanian authorities in the biannual Survey on the Paris Declaration. The final outcome of the
Governance Filter v2.0 relates to improved disclosure of the Bank’s work with government (not simply
project outcomes), as evidenced by an improvement in relevant indicators in the periodic Bank Client
Survey in Albania.

E.

The CPS Financing Program

109. New IBRD lending to Albania over the CPSperiod is expected to amount io about US$275
million, contingent on IBRD’sfinancial’s capacity. The Bank financing program comprises:
(i) completion of 15 ongoing investmentprojects and large multi-donor trustfund, and
(ii) preparation of 8 new investmentprojects and a series of annual developmentpolicy loans.

The CPS is planned to include policy-based lending of around US$lOO million (or US$25 million per
year) but would need to remain flexible given uncertainty in macroeconomic policy and the potential
for worse-than-expected external economic shocks. The proposed DPL operations are planned to focus
on sectoral reforms in social services in FY 11, and on broader reforms supporting growth and

32

competitiveness during FY 12-FY14. However, the amount of budget support lending will necessarily be
highly dependent on Albania’s macroeconomic performance and stability over the CPS period. For
example, DPL lending could be reduced and the freed-up IBRD resources reallocated to investment
lending in the event that the Government fails to make necessary the fiscal adjustments to return to a
lower-debt trajectory during the CPS period. Conversely, the Bank should also be prepared for much
larger DPL support to Albania if the country is hit hard by Eurozone economic events, despite satisfactory
macroeconomic management. Planned investment operations would then either be postponed or dropped.
Finally, besides macroeconomic performance, the levels of planned budget support lending will also be
subject to IBRD’s financial capacity. Should there be a need for any significant changes to the DPL
lending currently proposed as a result of these or other factors alternative scenarios would be discussed
with Management and presented to the Board in the CPS progress report or via another appropriate
strategy memorandum, together with new operations.
110. Depending on the market conditions during the next four years, IFC expects to invest about
$120-150 million in the private sector in Albania and to use its advisory services to secure private
financing for road maintenance, water supply, solid waste management, and renewable energy. IFC
investment in the private sector will be channeled through direct financing in a variety of projects ranging
from agribusiness to, energy, and social sectors. In the financial sector investments will range from
strengthening banks’ capitalization (where needed), long term financing for MSMEs, and renewable
energy and energy efficiency products.

F.

The CPS Knowledge Program

111. The 2010 Client Survey and the CPS consultation process noted the support among all
stakeholders for a continued contribution by the Bank to the transparent and public policy dialogue on
the development challenges facing Albania. The Bank Group will continue to provide analytical and
advisory services to help Albania meet the challenges in the coming years, but also to ensure greater

33

public engagement in the discussion of these challenges. The recently completed Country Economic
Memorandum, Investment Climate Assessment, Country Governance Review will be fully disseminated
in FY 11, and then followed by a series of quarterly economic reviews aimed to opening up the dialogue
on macroeconomic policies. The Bank will also continue its biennial series of local Albania Bank
Conferences on Development Economics (ABCDE), started under the last CAS, to provide a periodic,
and neutral, venue for public debate on these and other issues.
112. The Bank and IFC’s knowledge programs are also helping to move forward regional
integration in the Western Balkans. IFC will continue the implementation of its mainly regional
program of advisory services in Albania. These are aimed, not only to strengthen the business
environment and the capacities of the local private sector to compete in a more integrated European and
international markets, and to make progress on EU approximation in a number of areas, but also to help
further integrate Albania more with neighboring countries in the sub-region through a sharing of reform
experiences. On the Bank side, Albania will benefit from more regional economic and sector work.
Specifically, the Bank has an ongoing program of regional work on poverty analysis and the financial
sector that focus on regional priorities, and a revolving fund for regional sector work. The recent focus of
this fund has been on management of local roads and an assessment of the railway sector under the
SEETO making way for a new regional treaty, energy issues related to the ECSEE, the impact of climate
change on regional water resources and, most recently, shared experiences and challenges in social
policy. Future areas will be defined as needs and potential synergies emerge.
G.

Monitoring and Evaluation

113. The CPS will rely on a combination of existing and developing monitoring and evaluation
mechanisms. First, the Bank will continue its longstanding programmatic support for poverty monitoring
and analysis in Albania, while emphasizing more explicitly its attention to monitoring and analyzing
gender disparities. Albania has a well-established program of household based and living standards
surveys which are conducted every three years, to which the Bank has traditionally provided technical
support. Similarly, the Bank will expand its regular program of macroeconomic monitoring to include the
production of public quarterly economic briefs as long as Albania remains on a non-programmatic
relationship with the IMF. The need for such briefs will be reevaluated from time to time in light of
growing market access and market information. Finally, the Bank is supporting the development of the
Government’s own monitoring and evaluation (M&E) mechanisms for the national development strategy
through the IPS MDTF. In terms of program implementation, the Bank will undertake annual joint
portfolio reviews with the Government and the joint preparation of the CPS Progress Report in FY 13.

VI. MANAGING RISKS
114. Implementation of the CPS program identified in the previous chapter is subject to four main
risks as follows:
1 15 . Potential deterioration of the macroeconomic situation. The fragility of Albania’s external
environment and the country’s current macroeconomic framework and fiscal policy stance present critical
risks for the Country Partnership Strategy. A further worsening of the external environment and
financing opportunities, and/or less than adequate policy responses would be addressed through an
adjustment of the Bank’s program of budget support loans either to meet urgent financing needs or to
delay or reduce programmed budget support (para 109). The Bank has already intensified its dialogue on
macroeconomic policy, given the absence of a disbursing IMF program. In addition, the Bank will
coordinate closely with the EC on monitoring the macroeconomic situation and on the proposed policy

34

,

responses. Nevertheless, given the high levels of uncertainty, some flexibility will be needed to program
appropriate financing responses over the short-to-medium term.
116. Persistent political tensions. Although Albania has already made considerable strides in
consolidating multi-party democracy and peaceful transitions of power, the political climate remains very
polarized. With local elections approaching, there are fears that a current stand-off between the
government and opposition parties over alleged electoral irregularities could persist or new politically
divisive issues could emerge. This in turn would have obvious negative implications for CPS
implementation, both because the attention of central and local governments would shift from
development to political issues and also because project and policy decision-making could come to a
standstill in cases where multi-party boards, joint evaluation committees and the like are part of the
implementation process. Still, the context of the EU accession agenda with its strong political criteria and
broad-based support in Albania - across political parties and the general public - should provide
incentives for early resolution of political issues.
117. Bank role in supporting development in Albania. Given that new IBRD lending is relatively
small and increasingly selective it is possible that our ability to influence sectoral reforms through policy
dialogue and institutional development could be reduced, especially as concessional financing from the
EU becomes more readily available. This, however, need not necessarily affect the achievement of
results on the ground as the Bank Group will continue to provide analytic and advisory services to help
Albania meet its development challenges. Moreover, the Bank will continue its ongoing practice of
partnering with other external partners including the EU to engage in policy dialogue on key issues in a
coordinated manner.
118. Persistent implementation challenges. Albania needs to accelerate its implementation of donorfinanced projects, including those financed by the Bank. However, there are still significant capacity
weaknesses, not least in intergovernmental coordination, that hinder timely implementation of the
portfolio. Such challenges may persist, and even intensify, as the Government moves ahead on the
challenging agenda of EU approximation. The CPS approach of simplifying and streamlining the
portfolio is meant precisely to reduce the complexity of Bank support to Albania and thereby reduce the
administrative burden for Government. As such, the Bank will ensure that while moving to a smaller
number of larger operations, efforts will be made to avoid increasing the internal complexity of individual
operations. In addition, the Government has recently established a new mechanism at the Cabinet level to
focus periodically on key constraints in externally-assisted operations in an effort to resolve bottlenecks
and accelerate implementation of investment projects across the various sectors.

Introduction

This Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report (CAS CR) takes stock of the effectiveness of the
Bank Group’s assistance to Albania during FY06-09 and draws lessons for the preparation of the
forthcoming Country Partnership Strategy. Where appropriate - i.e., in areas where there is a high
degree of continuity between the FY06-09 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) and Bank Groupsupported activities under previous CASs (e.g., establishing a private sector-led growth model,
improving public sector management) -- the review takes a medium-term look at the impact of Bank
assistance rather than limiting itself to the last CAS period. It is the team’s view that this allows for a
fuller understanding of the Bank role and impact in these areas. For the preparation of this CAS CR the
team has:
Examined the alignment between the CAS design and the stated objectives of the
Government program
Reviewed progress towards the long-term development objectives of the country
Reviewed the Bank’s role in supporting observed progress towards these longer term
objectives
Undertook an intensive review of project documentation and AAA
Extensively discussed and consulted with relevant Government officials, other Albanian
stakeholders, donor representatives and Bank operational staff
This report benefited from discussions with the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) team that worked
on its independent evaluation of the Albania FY06-09 CAS, including undertaking a mission to Albania
in February 2010. It also draws on key reviews undertaken during the implementation period, most
notably the CAS Progress Report (CAS PR FY08), project completion reports and ISRs. The CASPR,
which was discussed in-depth with Government, Parliament and other stakeholders, also made formal
adjustments to the strategy taking into account realities on the ground. These changes have been taken
into account in this CAS CR’s assessment of Bank’s performance in Albania.

11.

National DeveloDment Goals and Links to the CAS obiectives

Since 1992, when Albania began its transition from decades of political, economic and social isolation,
successive governments have placed the achievement of better integration with its South-East European
(SEE) neighbors and eventual EU accession at the top of their development agendas. This goal has
widespread political support within Albanian society and, to a notable degree, has acted as a unifying
element in an otherwise often-polarized political environment. After the recovery from the pyramid
crisis of the late 1990s, the current millennium, and particularly the last 4-5 years, has seen greater
momentum in Albanian efforts to achieve EU integration. In July 2006, the country signed a
Stabilization and Association Agreement with the EU. Since then, in mid December 2009, Albania
received the formal questionnaire which is the official start of the EU candidacy review process and an
extensive response submitted by the Albanian Government is currently under consideration by the EU.

FY06-FY09 CAS CompletionReport

Within the overarching goal of SEE and EU integration, the main elements of Albania’s
development strategy are laid out in the National Strategy for Social and Economic Development
(NSSED), which was first adopted by the Government in 2001, and subsequently updatedlrevised and
readopted as the NSDI in 2007. The NSSED/NSDI is a comprehensive medium-term strategy which
shifts the national agenda from short-term crisis management to establishing conditions for long-term
growth, poverty reduction and integration with the EU. The strategy has strong government ownership
and was prepared through a robust participatory process involving diverse stakeholders from throughout
Albanian society. In summary, the strategy comprises three pillars as follows: (i) improving
governance, (ii) promoting private sector-led growth, and (iii) fostering human development. The
NSSED and NSDI both recognize that weak governance and institutions are at the root of Albania’s
developmental problems. The NSSED/NSDI also accords high priority to the task of reducing poverty,
raising standards of living, and accelerating the attainment of the MDGs, identifying rapid, private
sector-led growth as a principal means of achieving these objectives.
In turn, the World Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy for FYsO6-09, which was developed in
close partnership with Government and other stakeholders, wasfully aligned with the NSSEDLNSDI
and aimed to support the achievement of the outcomes (including those pertaining to EU integration)
contained therein. Support was organized around two pillars: (i) continued economic growth through
support to private sector development; and (ii) improving public service delivery, particularly in the
social sectors. Improved governance was planned to be interwoven throughout the entire CAS program
through the application of a “Governance Filter” to all Bank-supported interventions including lending,
analytical work and technical assistance. Application of the Governance Filter to Bank-supported
products meant that every product was reviewed not only on its technical and strategic merits but also
on whether or not it contributed to: (i) greater transparency in the use of public resources; (ii) increased
autonomy and de-politicization of key public sector counterpart organizations; (iii) more analysis of the
roles of local governments including activities to develop their capacity; and (iv) stronger mechanisms
for advocacy and more citizen involvement. It was recognized from the outset that better governance
and institutional strengthening is essentially a longer-term activity, likely exceeding the CAS by several
years. The importance of the issue however justified its inclusion in the CAS even in the absence of
specified end-outcomes by the end of the CAS period.
Each pillar of the CAS served as an umbrella for actions in a number of mutually-reinforcing or
complementary areas which, taken together, would ensure achievement of the main aim@) of the
pillar. As such, the Pillar 1 objective of accelerated private sector-led growth was to be achieved
through concerted action in six main areas: (i) maintaining macroeconomic stability; (ii) strengthening
the financial sector and financial intermediation; (iii) enhancing the business climate; (iv) establishing
clear property rights and deepening the land market; (v) building and maintaining Albania’s
infrastructure including through private participation; and (vi) raising agricultural productivity.
Similarly CAS efforts to strengthen the delivery of services for human development under Pillar 2
involved several mutually reinforcing initiatives including improving accountability in the education
system, strengthening technical and organization capacities in the health sector, addressing the fiscal
sustainability of the social insurance system, and improving water supply and sanitation services in both
urban and rural areas.
The CAS included a results matrix with clearly defined outcomes and milestones for each of the two
main pillars, but the matrix was formally revised through the CASPR, since implementation
experience suggested the need to (0 streamline the number of indicators to be monitored and (io
ensure that the milestones and outcome indicators were better aligned with desired CAS goals. The
outcomes and milestones identified in the CAS results matrix were drawn directly from the project
development objectives across the portfolio and were therefore carefully specified and generally
relevant in terms of the areas of influence of Bank activities in achieving development goals. However,
because they had initially been developed to measure project results, several of the indicators were too
narrow in scope vis a vis the CAS’S broader objectives (compared with the goals for specific projects),

44

FY06-FYO9 CAS Completion Report

leading to the need either for a multitude of indicators per CAS outcome or, sometimes, to a disconnect
between the indicators chosen and the desired goal. For example, reduction of financial and
distribution losses in the power sector (outcome indicators included in the matrix) cannot have any
appreciable impact on the CAS goal of raising private sector investment unless also accompanied by
improvements in the reliability of power supply - an indicator not included in the CAS results matrix.
Similarly, a number of input indicators in education were included in the results matrix to serve as a
proxy for quality in the absence of assessment tools for direct quality measurement. Monitoring of
CAS outcomes during the early years of CAS implementation also suggested that there was a need to
streamline and better align the indicators being monitored, as a critical means of focusing the
Government’s and Bank’s attention on the most important development goals supported by the CAS.
To this end, the FY08 CAS Progress Report involved a systematic effort to streamline the results matrix
in consultation with the Government and other stakeholders, keeping only the most strategic indicators
and thereby enhancing the potential for achieving a credible assessment of the impact of CAS activities.
The consolidated CAS PR matrix focuses on 46 outcomes: 30 for the first pillar and 16 for the second.

Overall, progress towards achievement of CAS results has been very strong, with 48 percent of
specified CAS outcomes having been fully achieved, and another 41 percent partially achieved or

45

FY06-FY09 CAS Completion Report

clearly on track (Table I). As might be expected, progress on the milestones - linked directly to Banksupported activities - has been even higher, with 60 percent achieved, and about 29 percent on track to
be achieved. When reviewed in terms of achievement of, or progress towards, the results specified in
the CAS PR matrix, performance appears to be strongest under the second pillar (improved service
delivery for poverty reduction, particularly in the social sectors).
When measured in terms of achievement of specified outcomes and milestones, the Bank made its
best contribution in the social sectors (Pillar 2), where all twelve outcomes were achieved or partially
achieved In education, substantial progress was made in improving inputs to basic and secondary
education including reform of the curriculum, establishment of local management and school boards in
about 15 percent of schools and increased equity in the distribution of public resources per student.
Targets for increased secondary school enrolment were also partially met, with enrollment rising about
8-9 percent by the end of the CAS period. In health, a major shift in the financing and production of
health services was initiated through the step-wise introduction of reforms to health insurance, provider
payment mechanisms, a new co-payment scheme for patients and training of health system managers.
These steps are expected to have a significant impact on efficiency of services and eventually, lower
costs to patients. Moreover, steps were taken to increase the quality of care provided through primary
care facilities through the training of physicians and nurses in 7 of 13 regions and the development of
evidence-based Clinical Practice Guidelines for the 32 most common diseases/sicknesses in Albania.
However, health indicators in Albania still remain lower than in comparable neighboring countries, and
continued attention to access, quality and management improvements will be necessary going forward.
In education, too, it is critical that reforms continue to increase the number of individuals who have the
skills and productivity to innovate and creatively solve problems. This is fundamental to the
Government’s core objective of raising productivity as a principal means of sustaining the impressive
economic growth achieved thus far.
CAS activities aimed at poverty reduction and rural development were also very successful in relation
to identified indicators. All ten indicators identified in this area (under 1.6 and 2.4) were achieved or
partially achieved. Success with respect to rural development and, hence, reduction of the urban-rural
poverty gap appears to have been closely related to the participatory approach adopted in the design and
implementation of several relevant projects - National Resources Development, Water Resources
Management, Fishery Development, Agricultural Services, Second Community Works and Social
Services Delivery. Moreover, the participatory and decentralized approaches (Le., substantial
involvement of local government partners), adopted for several of these operations also had a strong
positive impact on social service delivery. Recent poverty results show an accelerated reduction of
poverty rates in rural areas with headcount poverty declining from 24 to 17 percent during 2005-08. In
addition to growth and human capital investments which helped reduce poverty, the CAS period saw a
substantial increase in the access of the most vulnerable groups (those with labor-scarcity or other
constraints that limit ability to benefit from growth) to social assistance services including both social
care and targeted income transfers for the poorest households. Reform and development of social
assistance is a continuing priority as is the re-starting of pension reform to ensure sustainable support to
the nation’s elderly population.
Achievement of results was also broadly satisfactory under Pillar I , although progress lagged in a
few areas. As discussed in greater detail below, Albania grew rapidly for much of the past ten years
(and including the first 2.5 years of this CAS), achieving a growth rate as high as 6.5 percent in 2008
before slowing again to an estimated 2.3% in 2009, in the wake of the global financial and economic
crisis. Nonetheless, the fact that Albania was able to continue growing through 2009 is in itself
remarkable, especially when viewed against the backdrop of other ECA economies which for the most
part suffered declines in GDP. Indeed, Albania was one of only two European countries that was able to
maintain positive growth throughout the current global recession. Moreover, a broadly sound macroeconomic framework was maintained until 2008 and a Poverty Reduction Growth Facility-Extended
Fund Facility (PRGF-EFF) program agreed with the IMF remained on track throughout the CAS

46

FY06-FY09 CAS Completion ReDort

period. By 2008-09, however, the road to better quality fiscal adjustment was marred by two key
issues: (i) the contracting and implementation of the Rreshen-Kalimash segment of the Durres-Kukes
road, which placed major pressures on the national budget and (ii) the management of the electricity
sector which reverted to deteriorating financial performance throughout the CAS period. These two
factors in effect reversed Albania’s long tradition of fiscal consolidation, although not to the point of
impairing macroeconomic stability. The success in managing the impact of the global crisis through
2009 should not, however, lead to complacency: continuing troubles in key European economies especially Greece and Italy - suggests that Albania and other developing countries are now facing a
different international landscape including greater awareness of the risks of high sovereign debt which
will demand policy adjustments. As such, macro-management remains an area in which the Bank
should remain closely engaged through policy dialogue, AAA and possible policy-based lending.

The Pillar 1 CAS program was instrumental in supporting the creation of a number of important
building blocks on which to move future progress in public sector management. The CAS period saw
a continuation of the broadly positive trends across all major aspects of governance including: (i)
strengthening voice and accountability; (ii) improving the quality of economic regulation as evidenced
by improved rankings in the Global Competitiveness Index and Doing Business; (iii) policy
coordination, public expenditure management, procurement improvements and better internal and
external audit. More specifically the CAS period saw critical reforms in public expenditure
management including a new budget law, procurement law and public investment management
procedures, privatization of the electricity distribution company, inspections reform under BERIS. The
new Territorial Planning Law and ongoing support for land registration has also been important
although significant efforts will continue to be necessary for some time to come. However, efforts to
strengthen the civil service have thus far been only marginally effective, if at all. The key area of
failure has been in the area of civil service law implementation and the de-politicization of public
administrations, notwithstanding a strong effort under the CAS program.
The infrastructure goals under Pillar 1 of the CAS program were largely met with respect to
transport but progress on energy has been relatively slow and d i f f u l t -- although sustained effort
appears to finally be bearing fruit. Transport activities under the CAS focused on roads maintenance,
roads quality (reduced roughness), road safety and increased efficiency through introduction of private
contracts for road maintenance. Stated CAS objectives were met or surpassed in each of these areas.
Moreover, the Bank played an important role in supporting the Government to rehabilitate and expand
its network of secondary and local roads, both through a Bank-financed project and, equally
importantly, through catalyzing around US$400 million from other external partners for road
improvement and construction. Improvement in the electricity sector has been relatively slower and
more difficult but sustained efforts are beginning to have some positive impacts - most notably the
unbundling of the electricity system and privatization of the distribution company (through joint World
Bank Group support) as well as reduction in energy losses and investment in transmission rehab and
thermal power generation.
Finally, results with respect to the governance filler show progress across the board (see Chartl),
with notable successes in terms of institution-strengthening on a sectoral basis but slower-thanhoped-for progress on system-wide efforts to improve the rule of law, including controlling
corruption vis a vis businesses. All projects and the majority of the non-lending services during the
CAS period included a governance focus or components and attempted to address institutional
strengthening in some way. On balance, it would appear that the contribution of the projects to the
creation of stronger mechanisms for governance in individual sectors was substantial. Especially
noteworthy examples in terms of improved transparency and management of the sectors include: (i) in
education, the introduction of school boards and blind testing for university entrance exams; (ii) better
licensing of providers and introduction of performance contracts in the health system; (iii) strengthened
community management of forests, (iv) establishment of user associations in irrigation and fisheries; (v)
improved management of social care centers; (vi) better supervision of the financial sector, including

47

FY06-FY09 CAS Completion Report

microcredit and insurance providers; (vii) substantially improved pensions records; and (viii) more
transparent and more technically sound selection of road investments. By contrast, none of the
systemic outcomes under the second country development goal of: “enhancing effectiveness of public
sector and governance structures to support private sector development” was fully achieved,
notwithstanding an active CAS program in this area and some progress in building the blocks for future
improvement. Overall however, there can be little doubt that while much remains to be done,
governance improvements already made - especially in the effectiveness of public administration have been instrumental in the country’s impressive economic performance and improved human
development outcomes.

PILLAR
1: Continued Economic Growth through Support to Private Sector Development

Albania continued on its trajectory of strong growth during the CAS period and joined the middle
income group in 2008. During 2006-08, Albania saw growth rates of 6 percent on average and was one
of the few countries in the region to maintain a positive rate of real growth in 2009, estimated at about
2.3 percent. The economy has achieved robust non-inflationary growth, albeit with increasing external
imbalances. Sound macroeconomic management continued until 2007, including sustained efforts to
achieve fiscal consolidation, debt reduction, and improvements in external balances. Fiscal balances
were constrained below real growth rates, at around 3 percent. Tax revenue increased by over 2
percentage points of GDP in 2008, despite a cut in corporate and personal income tax rates. As part of a
better, more integrated policy-framework, improvements in public debt management took place and led
to a reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio from 56 percent in 2006 to 53 percent in 2007, and to a doubling
of the average maturity of public debt. Clearance of the majority of arrears on inoperative historical
external debt has taken place, with a few outstanding agreements to be finalized. Despite elevated levels
of CAD, the Albanian foreign position has remained sustainable throughout the CAS period.
As already mentioned, Albania has been one of the few European countries to maintain positive growth
after the onset of the global financial and economic crisis, due in large part to its limited exposure to
international markets as well as to the expansionary fiscal policy initiated before the crisis. In 2007,
Albania embarked on a very large - and geopolitically strategic - infrastructure project which has
ultimately caused a deviation from its long-standing policy of fiscal consolidation. In 2009, together

48

FY06-FY09 CAS Completion Report

with some pre-election spending on wage and pension increases, this infrastructure project formed the
basis of a fiscal expansion (approximately 8.2 percent of GDP) that would ease the impact of the global
financial crisis. However, in the latter half 2009, when the real impact of lower remittances and falling
exports began to emerge, the Government was slow in adjusting its spending policies in line with
falling revenues. The fiscal deficit jumped to 6.9 percent of GDP in 2009 and public debt approached
60 percent of GDP, up from 53.7 percent in 2007. Government has since been forced to cut both capital
and recurrent expenditures. While the authorities remain committed to bringing fiscal policy back into
line, expenditure adjustments are less than orderly and could potentially tarnish Albania’s reputation for
sound fiscal management. Despite these deviations, public debt remains sustainable, if the government
maintains its commitment to return to fiscal consolidation.
Cross-country analysis of expenditure efficiency shows that while levels of public investments and
employment (wage bill) are broadly appropriate, the country could achieve better outcomes with its
current level of spending. Nevertheless, under-funding of non-wage inputs reduces productivity and is
associated with low levels of educational achievements and inadequate health care.

CAS Outcome: Integration of variouspolicy frameworks into a single medium-term development
plan aligned with budget and MTEFMTBP [Achieved]

In general, Albania has achieved better alignment of its budget with medium term development
objectives and strategic policy choices. In 2007, the Government undertook a major updating of its
national development plan, now called NSDI. This process included the development of 32 sectoral
and cross-cutting development strategies which were consulted with the private sector, civil society and
development partners. Meanwhile, the IPS has been adopted and is being implemented to integrate the
various programs, projects and strategies of the NSDI with the Medium Term and annual budget
processes. In 2008, with support from the Bank under the Development Policy Reform Program, the
Parliament adopted the new organic budget law to formalize a series of improved budgeting procedures
that have been underway in the medium term budget process for several years. Meanwhile, the IPS has
achieved a significant level of systematization with the production of annual progress reports, including
an External Assistance Orientation document for donors.6 Future progress should focus on better
integration of public investment planning into the MTBP, deepen consultation with non-governmental
actors, and further enhance the information systems that link development plans with public
expenditures. Progress on the latter is supported by a Bank-supervised, multi-donor trust fund
CAS Outcome: Broad stakeholders, including NGOs and the private sector, are consultedfor major
policy formulation [Partially Achieve4
The World Bank, together with other development partners, has been instrumental in spreading the
culture of public consultation into public projects and programs in Albania.
Progress remains
incipient, but promising. A broad consultation process was conducted for the NSDI: each of 32 substrategies was individually discussed with civil society, private sector and development partners,
demonstrating that the consultation process -- begun in the PRSP process under the previous CAS - is
now fully established in Albania and has been internalized by the Albanian Government as well as
many other stakeholders.
Some notable examples of the effective use of consultation in CASsupported legislative and policy reforms include the processes associated with developing the Law on
Local Government Borrowing, the Health Care Law, the Territorial Planning Law and the South Coast
Development Plan. Most of these involved several months, (and in the case of the Territorial Planning
Law and the Health Care Law, several years) of consultations with Parliamentary committees, national

For example, the Bank-supportedReport on Standards and Compliance (ROSC) Accounting and Audit Country
Action Plan was later formalized by Government into an additional NSDI strategy for accounting and audit.
Likewise, preparation of a new donor-coordinated effort to support water and wastewater investments
nationwide is being preceded by a revision of the national water and wastewater strategy to improve its policy
content.

and local government and local communities. Consultations for the South Coast Development Plan
have been hailed by the national government, local beneficiaries, and the local Aarhus Convention
Centre as a best practice in Albania. In the social sectors, the Bank has supported successful
consultations on social policy for vulnerable groups through the Social Services Delivery Project and
multi-party dialogue on pension reform for several months, at the request of Government. Although the
latter did not yield reform consensus, the political leadership on all sides now recognizes the need for
systematic dialogue to arrive at a workable reform strategy.
Notwithstanding the above, this CAS outcome is considered Partially Achieved in part because of the
challenges on the government-private sector dialogue front. Although the Government reopened
discussions with the Business Consultative Council (established in 2002) in 2006, these have since
lapsed and been less than effective. BERIS project has emphasized consultations with the private sector
in its preparation, and subsequent support for licensing and inspections reform and the establishment of
a regulatory impact assessment system. Although such assistance is now getting traction, the
Government has moved ahead too rapidly with an under-prepared and under-consulted reform of
licensing from which the Bank had to withdraw support. Likewise, during 2008-09, the Government
undertook a series of fast-tracked regulatory changes, e.g. in tax and other policies, with little or no
consultation or public discussion - in effect creating an emerging climate of some regulatory instability.

CAS Outcome: Improved quality offical adjustment, as evidenced by increasing the share of nonwage recurrent spending [Not Achieved]
As targeted, the fiscal criteria of the new IMF program were achieved for most of the program period
leading to the closure of the Fund?s 3-year PRGF-EFF program in early 2009. Public finances have
strengthened, largely due to improved tax reform and improved tax administration. The share of nonwage spending in the recurrent budget has increased marginally (add numbers). However, over the CAS
period, Albania did reverse its trend toward fiscal consolidation toward increasing deficits associated
with the ballooning expenditures for the Rreshen-Kalimash section on the road to Kosovo, and
increasing fiscal transfers to cover the deficits at the electricity company. Within-year fiscal
adjustments to emerging constraints remain somewhat ad hoc as part of a budget process that has
involved persistent supplementary budgets.

CAS Outcomes:Public investments are planned and prioritized in a contestableprocess based on
solid analysis. [Achieved]

50

FY06-FY09 CAS Complefion Report

Albania now has a realistic, coherent and authoritative basis for the planning and prioritization of public
investment projects. The NSDI and its component parts have been developed within a realistic
macroeconomic and fiscal framework. Specific guidance on economic infrastructure (transport, energy,
wastewater and sanitation, and environment) is provided by sector. Nevertheless the quality and
coverage of the various strategies are variable and further effort is required to improve the strategic
focus and therefore the guidance for annual investment budgeting. On the institutional side, the
Government introduced budgetary reviews of investment projects, developed a register of public
investment projects and adopted new Public Investment Management Procedures in 2008. These are
gradually being internalized by line ministries in budget preparation. In 2007, the Government
introduced a competitive mechanism for distribution of grants to local governments for municipal
investments.
In the roads sector, public investments are informed by a regularly updated Albania National Transport
Plan and analyzed carefully by the General Roads Directorate (GRD). The Bank also has supported the
establishment of a road asset management system and investment allocation system for a large donorfinance investment program on secondary and local roads. However, there remain instances when new
investments are introduced in an ad hoc manner. In energy, the selection of largely donor-financed
projects has been guided by the Power Sector Action Plan, whereas in the municipal water sector, it has
largely been ad hoc. The Government is now preparing a master waster sector investment plan.
Support for the preparation of a hospital master plan in provided by the Health Sector Modernization
Project. Meanwhile Education Excellence and Equity Project (EEEP) has assisted MoES to include
demographic analysis for its school investment choices, to strengthen its investment department,
establish new building standards for schools, and in the ongoing preparation of a school mapping plan

Governance has been improving very gradually in Albania over the years, but the situation still calls for
further improvement. Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) percentile ranking on the indicator of
government effectiveness has improved from 3 1 to 45 between 2005 and 2008 while that of regulatory
quality rose fi-om 47 to 57, and rule of law from 24 to 33. It should be noted that these indicators
remain low for a middle income country. On perceptions of corruption, Albania’s rank improved from
108 out of 146 countries with a score of 2.5 in 2004 (on a scale of 1 - 10 where 10 is the best) on
Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) to 95 out of 180 countries with a score
of 3.2 in 2009.
Only modest progress has been made towards creating a public administration based on meritocracy
and professionalism, an important goal for the CAS. The organizational structures of line ministries are
slowly improving with support from individual projects, but implementation of the broader civil service
law has deteriorated. High turnover of public officials following changes in ministerial leadership
remains a hallmark of the Albanian civil service and continues to hinder the ability of the public sector
to implement reform agendas systematically over time. New laws on procurement (enacted in 2006)
and public concessions (2007) are helping to improve interactions between the State and the private
sector, but there continues to be a need to strengthen institutional capacity and strengthen adherence to
the rule of law in government decision-making.
CAS Outcomes: Computerized treasury system isfully operational and begins to expand to selected
spending ministries [Partially Achieved]
A modern treasury system has been set up in Albania since 2005 with support from the Public
Administrative Reform Project (PARP, closed in 2006), and further supported under the multi-donor

51

FY06-FY09 CAS Completion Report

IPS trust fund since mid 2008. However efforts to fully computerize the system and to expand it to
other parts of government have been substantially delayed, largely because of insufficient political
commitment and significant weaknesses in project management and technical skills in the central
departments. The Bank did not extend the P A W in 2007, when it closed, due to this lack of
commitment. However, there had been a trend towards improved progress at the tail end of the project
and it remains a question as to whether a fifth year of implementation and Bank supervision, could have
accelerated progress at that time. The lack of a fully functioning treasury system put at risk the
integrity of the public financial management system and affected disbursements in Bank projects which,
under this CAS, moved to use country systems in financial management. However, it is expected that
the computerized system will be fully operational in early 2010 after renewed efforts in recent months.
Links to the Human Resources Management Information System, technical extensions needed for the
IPS, and donor support to expand the system to other parts of government, remain hampered by the
delays in finalizing full computerization of the treasury system.
CAS Outcomes: Public procurement is conducted in accordance with a law meeting European
standards. [Partially Achieved]
A new Public Procurement Law was enacted in 2006 and became effective in 2007, as part of the
Development Policy Operation reform program. The new law is aligned with EU legislation, except for
the structure of the complaints mechanism. After being addressed through the DPO I1 reform program,
the issue of the complaints mechanism is being finally resolved with support from EU, owing in part to
a discrepancy between Bank and EU approaches to the issue.
Nevertheless, the new law addressed several bottlenecks in the previous legislation such as overuse of
direct procurement and the lack of transparency in procedures. The new law has in fact significantly
reduced the use of direct procurement. According to the Public Procurement Agency (PPA), in 2008,
8.8 percent of procurement contracts over US$4000 were carried out by direct contracting compared
with close to a quarter of all contracts in 2005 (check OECD DAC which should haveJigures). Open
tendering (national and international) is now the most commonly used procurement method,
representing 56 percent of the total number of procurement contracts in 2008, compared with 38 percent
in 2004. Regarding transparency, all contract notices, bidding documents and awards are published in
the PPA website and Albania has rolled out a new e-government procurement system (EPS) to most of
its contracting authorities in 2009 with support from US - MCC program.
The passage of the new procurement law allowed the Bank to partially use some elements of the
country system for project procurement. This is now the case for all the projects approved under this
CAS. The Bank remains an important partner for Albania in the improvement in public procurement.
Having encouraged the Donor Technical Secretariat to expand joint work on fiduciary systems, in line
with Paris Declaration, the Bank now sits on the advisory group for the UNDP -financed 2"d OECD
DAC procurement Assessment. Meanwhile, the Bank is in the process of evaluating the EPS for use in
Bank and other donor-financed projects which are recipient-executed, and will support further
refinements under the Governance Partnership Facility Window 1 Program. The Bank, together with
other donors has and is also supporting training in public procurement for public administration
students at the University of Tirana.
CAS Outcomes:All new concessions are implemented in line with transparent and effective legal
framework. [Partially Achieved]

The Bank and IFC supported the preparation and enactment of the new concessions law in December
2006 requiring competition including a more transparent treatment of unsolicited bids.
IFC
subsequently supported the preparation of two open competitions, for the Ashta Hydropower Plant
which was successfully awarded in 2009, and the Durres Port container terminal which was haited by
Government also in 2009. In 2009, as part of the preparation of the (subsequently-cancelled) DPO 11,

52

FY06-FY09 CAS Completion Report

the Bank supported a review of the implementation of the law. The review found that while in general
the law was being implemented in line with its legal provisions, the process of granting concessions
was not fully effective in terms of maximizing the public value of the concessions awarded. Notably,
the government has demonstrated a tendency to accelerate the process of granting concessions, despite
very limited technical preparation on its side to ensure that the final concessions maximize public value.
Since passage of the law, the majority of concessions awarded were initiated by unsolicited bids7,
instead of by government-prepared open competitions. As a result, there has been a series of
government actions to reevaluate previously granted concessions, on the basis of either non-compliance
of private operators with the agreements, or questions on the process of awards. This also points to the
lack of preparatory work and quality assurance on the public sector side. The lesson here is that
following such a major legal reform in an important area of governance for Albania, there is a need for
continued implementation support not only to strengthen institutional capacities but also to continue to
reinforce political commitment at the highest levels.
CAS Outcomes: Configuration of public sector institutions adjusted to reflect mandates and
functions. (Partially Achieved]
Under the Public Administration Reform Project (PARP), functional reviews were prepared for each
line ministry. In early 2006, the Government issued a decree revising the public sector salary structure
and revising the structures of almost all the ministries, generally in line with the recommendations of
these reviews. It also began implementing the recommendations to enhance policy formulation and
coordination, including the strengthening and improving the transparency of the cabinet, donor
coordination and the establishment of an IPS, While few of the functional reviews prepared under the
PARP were implemented, several line ministries have benefited from substantial institutional
development through individual Bank-financed projects, including in budget, treasury, public
investment and debt management departments and the Financial Supervisory Authority in the Ministry
of Finance, policy, quality assurance and investment departments of education and health in their
respective Ministries, roads and maritime transport, water in the Ministry of Public Works, Transport
and Telecom, forestry in the Ministry of Environment, Public Procurement Agency, and the Ministry of
Economy, Trade and Energy in the areas of regulatory management. Nevertheless a handful of
ministries continue to be plagued by frequent reorganizations and structural changes that hinder policy
reform and strategy implementation.
CAS Outcomes: Consistent implementation of the civil service law. (Not Achieved]

Under the former CAS period, Albania approved a Civil Service Law in 1999, which is in line with
good international practice, and subsequently, in 2000, established a new Department of Public
Administration (DoPA) and a Civil Service Commission (CSC). Initially, the Law did help to improve
practices in some ministries and to influence the behavior and the incentive structure for decisions on
civil service appointments and dismissals. However, since 2005, compliance has deterioriated to the
point of being extremely uneven and ad hoc. The Department of Public Administration was
downgraded, and decisions of the CSC and ultimately the courts have been frequently disregarded by
government bodies. The high turnover of senior staff remains a hallmark of each change of minister,
even between electoral periods and without a change of political party, with the result that Government
is losing its ability to retain highly qualified and experienced staff in key technical positions for long
periods of time. Meanwhile, the DoPA has not been able to stop the increase in the use of term
contracts to hire civil servants, nor to ensure implementation of CSC decisions and to exercise its
authority as the managing authority of the civil service system. The Bank, through the PARP, the DPO
program and other instruments, supported the implementation of the civil service law in a polarized and
tense political environment, limited institutional capacity, and several changes in heads of key

plant, launched with a minimum of preparation on the government side after receipt of the unsolicited bid.

implementing agencies. Failure to comply fully with the civil service reform agenda led to delays in the
second DPO which was eventually cancelled.

1.3
Country Development Goal: Business environment is conducive to attracting higher
levels of both domestic and foreign investment
Domestic private investment increased from 19 percent of GDP in 2005 to an estimated 21 percent in
2009. However, at least half of this investment is devoted to a single sector -- construction. While, FDI
rose significantly from 3.3 percent of GDP in 2005 to 8.2 percent in 2009, its absolute level still
remains among the lowest in the sub-region. Albania improved its ranking on the Doing Business
indicator from 120th in the 2006 index (which measured performance in 2005) to 82nd in the 2010
index (which measures performance in 2009). The basis for this improvement was significant reforms
in time and cost of registering a business, trading across borders (including reducing bribery in
customs) and improvements in the regulations for getting credit and protection of shareholders.
Albania’s percentile ranking on the WGI indicator of regulatory quality increased from 49 to 57
between 2005 and 2008, rule of law from 16 to 24 and control of corruption from 29 to 39. As such,
Albania still has a long way to go to attain a conducive business environment for domestic and foreign
investment.
CAS Outcome: Improved regulation and supervision of insurance and micro-credit institutions
[Achieved]
Licensing, regulation, and supervision of microcredit institutions have been strengthened with the
issuance by the Bank of Albania (BOA) of a regulation “On the Granting of License to Non Bank
Financial Subjects” and a regulation “On Supervision Norms of Microcredit Institutions” in 2009.
Moreover, BOA has prepared updated onsite and offsite supervision manuals and reporting formats for
microcredit institutions and credit unions. Meanwhile, in 2006, the independent supervisor for the nonbanking sector, the Financial Supervisory Authority was established, became fully operational and is
implementing measures to improve the performance of insurance companies. FSA has recently
introduced supervision manuals, minimum capital tests, set of financial ratios to improve supervision
and performance of insurance companies and its transition to a risk based supervisory approach. Other
instruments include the actuarial valuation of non-life claims with intervention ladder, claims
management policy handling the claims payment specifically focusing to policy-holders protection and
the 5 year road map for transition period. The supervision of the insurance sector will become gradually
better and efficient after the implementation of these steps. Another noteworthy development in the
sector is the introduction of a series of serious steps in motor insurance mainly in motor third party
liability (i.e establishment of a motor insurance information center; developing a data base including
premium and claims history and issuing regulation for establishing stricter criteria on the quality of
reinsurers; etc). The new draft insurance law has been prepared in accordance with theEU
legal framework while technical regulations have been under preparation. All these improvements were
supported by technical assistance under the FIRST program.
CAS Outcome: Improved investor perceptions and reductions in time and costs for compliance with
business licensing and inspections as measured by ARCS, Doing Business, BEEPS, a n l o r ICA [Not
Achieved]

Albania has taken important steps to upgrade the regulatory framework for businesses and to remove
harmful administrative barriers, with notable results in some respects. The Government has been
successful in implementing a comprehensive reform program to establish of an efficient, sustainable
and transparent regulatory system, with the goal of increasing investment levels, enhancing competition
and stimulating business growth. These efforts are reflected in the improving Doing Business indicators

54

FY06-FY09 CAS Completion Report

and ranking: Albania moved from 136’’ in 2007 to 82ndin 2010 and achieved the second-highest rank
among the top ten reformers worldwide in 2009. Albania’s overall improvement in Doing Business
rankings does however mask considerable variation in ranking on individual indicators. For example,
the country’s rankings ranged from 15& for protection of minority shareholder rights, to 91st on
enforcing contracts, to 1731d on getting construction permits. However, a significant gap remains
between officially adopted regulatory policies and their implementation and enforcement. The recent
CEM and ICA note that this significantly reduces the otherwise high returns to private investment in
Albania, deterring both foreign and local investors. Informal enforcement practices, including
inconsistent and unpredictable interpretation of regulation or arbitrary enforcement by the judicial
system, impose a burdensome “time tax” and “bribe tax” on firms, thus eroding the benefits of
regulatory reform. Notably, 58 percent of Albanian firms report the need to pay bribes to government
officials to “get things done” - a far higher share than in comparator countries. The time tax is also
more burdensome in Albania than in comparator countries, with a reported 19 percent of Albanian
managers’ time spent dealing with government regulations and, for example, an average of 5.5 visits by
tax officials experienced per year. Overall, Albania performs very poorly in terms of regulatory quality,
control of corruption and rule of law, dimensions of the globally-estimated WGI that capture the
informal regulatory environment.
CAS Outcome: Improved accounting and auditing standards and disclosure of corporate information
in line with EU requirements [Partially Achieved]

During this CAS period, Albania put in place several elements of a modern corporate financial
reporting framework, including adopting the Country Action Plan to Enhance Corporate Financial
Reporting in Albania in February 2009 (based on the 2006 Accounting and Audit ROSC) and passing a
new Auditing Law in March 2009. In 2008, Albania also enacted amendments to its company law
which focus on shareholder rights to information about company performance, and include access to
consolidated accounts and reports. The increased banking penetration and the increased number of
international audit companies doing business in Albania suggest that a larger proportion of firms are
now complying with financial reporting obligations and International Financial Reporting Standards,
which are required for Public Interested entities as per 2004 Accounting Law. Nevertheless, there
remains a sizeable gap between written legislation and its implementation.
1.4
Country Development Goal: Enhance national infrastrrtcture nwessary for economic
growth and private sector development

The Government formally adopted the Albanian National Transport Plan (ANTP) in 2005 and the
Transport Sector Policy and Strategy in 2007. The ANTP, prepared with support from the EU, and
agreed with the international financial institutions (IFIs), provides the basis for an overarching
framework for the sector and guidance to resource allocation in the sector. However, the link to the
overall strategic planning and budgeting frameworks needs to be strengthened further. Improvement is
required to increase efficiency and accountability in public spending by improving the planning,
budgeting, and execution of public investment projects, in particular those financed with government
resources only. During the CAS period, the Bank has been involved in the transport sector through one
closed and two ongoing operations.
Improvement in the electricity sector has been very slow and difficult, but sustained efforts over a
relatively long period started to have a positive impact by the end of the CAS period. With World Bank
Group support, Albania joined the Energy Community of South East Europe during the CAS period.
Meanwhile energy losses declined, billing collections improved (although very marginally),
rehabilitation of transmission was initiated, public investment in thermal power generation was
undertaken, the electricity system was unbundled, and the distribution system privatized. Nevertheless
the public electricity company was in difficult financial straits on an almost continuous basis. The
successful privatization of the distribution company in 2009, supported by IFC as transaction advisor,

55

FY06-FY09 CAS Completion Report

and with a Bank Partial Risk Guarantee, was a critical reform that is expected to help to ease cash flow
in the sector in the future. Finally, efforts to safeguard the country’s major hydroelectric plants and to
improve their operational efficiency are now underway.
CAS Outcome:Annual 5% increase in real budgetsfor road maintenance and introduction ofprivate
sector maintenance contracts [Achieved]
The Bank supported this sector through the Road Maintenance Project (already completed) and the
ongoing Transport Project. Under the former project, a condition requiring the government to increase
the annual budget of the GRD for maintenance by no less than 5 percent per year, was systematically
met. Still, by end-2006, according to the Bank’s Public Expenditure Institutional Review (PEIR),
Albania spent approximately 40 percent less than required on maintenance of the national road network.
Subsequently, under the Transport Project the covenant was increase to achieve a 10 percent increase in
funding for road maintenance annually and has also been systematically met. The Transport Project is
also supporting the introduction of output- and performance-based road maintenance for 10 percent of
the national road network, for which contracts have recently been signed for two pilot regions.
CAS Outcome: Reduced roughness index of 1,000 km of main and rural roadsfrom 9.79 in 2002 to
7.4 in mid-2007 [Aclzieved]
A reduction in the roads roughness index has been achieved and continues to be pursued. The Road
Maintenance Project contributed to reducing the roughness index from 10 for national roads and 19 for
rural roads to 5 and 8, respectively. Moreover, the new Transport Project (approved in 2007) is aiming
to reduce roughness levels even further before its completion in 2012 with output- and performancebased maintenance contracts for 3 1Okm or 10 percent of the national road network.
CAS Outcome: 1,000 km of secondary and local roads rehabilitated or reconstructed by 2010
[Partially Achieved]
Under the Secondary and Local Roads Project, the Bank is financing rehabilitatiodimprovement of 110
km of secondary and local roads, which are expected to be completed by the third quarter of 20 10. With
this project, the Bank has also catalyzed around US$400 million in commitments from other donors for
rehabilitating and improving additional 1,000-1,500 km of the secondary and local roads network.
CAS Outcome: Reductions in road accident andfatality rates by addressing accident black-spots
[Achieved]
Road accident fatality rates in Albania have been reduced from 15.12 per 10,000 registered vehicles in
2000 to 8.64 at the end of 2006. This improvement was better than the target of “10 % reduction’’
pursued by the Bank-financed Road Maintenance Project and the Transport Project. To reduce
accidents, a multi-agency safety program was implemented. Road safety barriers at various locations in
selected national roads were installed and 60 black-spots were improved. Directorate Road Safety
reports have been disseminated to the public as a way of promoting awareness. Nevertheless, these
rates are still one of the highest in the region and more than eight-fold higher than the European best.
CAS Outcome: Increase domestic po wer generation capacity by 15 percent [Achieved]
The Bank, together with EBRD and European Investment Bank (EIB) has supported the construction of
the Vlora Thermal Power Plant which represents the first significant investment in domestic power
generation in over 25 years in Albania. With an installed capacity of 750 GWh, the plant, which was
commissioned in early 2010, bring an 18 percent increase in average domestic power generation
capacity. Furthermore under the Dam Safety Project, the Bank will contribute to further increases by
supporting the optimized utilization of the cascade of dams on the Drini river, which are responsible for
the largest share of domestic generation.

56

FY06-FY09 CAS Completion Report

CAS Outcome: Achievement of annually agreed Power Sector Action Plan targets for reductions in
transmission and distribution losses [Not Achievedj
This outcome has not been achieved. The Power Sector Action Plan has been in place for very limited
periods during the CAS implementation. From 2005-06, a coordinated suspension of donor financing
was required to ensure its implementation by Government. And again in 2008, no final agreement was
ever reached on plan targets with government. Nevertheless, intermediate indicators/milestones have
been achieved, including the gradual reduction of transmission and distribution losses, from about 42
percent in 2007 to 34 percent in 2009; and the privatization of the distribution network with, among
others, a target to further reduce losses to 15 percent and improving colIections by 2014. These
improvements have not, however, been sufficient to reduce the unreliability and increase the quality of
electricity supplies to households and businesses. In 2008, businesses in Albania experienced 32 power
outages per month on average and 80% of firms reported owning or sharing a generator, in turn
supplying about 30% of the power consumed by them. Despite low nominal tariffs for electricity
(10Lek per KwH - more or less stable over the CAS period) the actual cost to firms is about 3 times
higher because of the high cost of using diesel generators. As a result, the broader CAS objective of
attracting more private investment will require much more reliable supplies of electricity from the
national grid.

Country Development Goal; Establish efiicient land markets and spatial planning to
1.5
support rural and urban development
The land market in Albania is gradually becoming more efficient but property rights are not yet secure.
Progress is being made on improving land registration and the share of land parcels that are titled, albeit
much more slowly than anticipated. Meanwhile, no progress has been achieved on planned pilots on
property valuation and taxation, and on legislative reforms to strengthen property rights. Weaknesses in
institutional coordination and frequent legislative changes, that are only partial solutions, seemed to be
underpinned by a lack of political will to relinquish territorial control from longstanding governance
problems. In terms of spatial planning, the Bank supporting for land use planning in both urban and
southern coastal areas has now been cancelled owing in part to emerging safeguard risks related to the
use of demolitions to enforce development controls, and, as well, to the limited capacities and
commitment at the national level. Nevertheless, the passage of the new Territorial Planning Law and
the South Coast Development Plan and regulations, provide important building blocks for Albania's
continued improvement in this area.
CAS Outcome:Accelerate completion of urban and rural cadastral zones (Target: 50% urban, 75%
rural-currently 81 % rural completed) /Partially Achievedj
The target for rural zones was already been achieved by the time of the CAS Progress Report in 2008,
but there has not yet been any significant progress on the urban areas because of delays in the
contracting of registration packages under the Land Administration and Management Project.
Nevertheless, the detailed inventories of unregistered properties in the 83 cadastral zones are complete,
and three large registration contracts are under implementation with related work on quality control.
Upon completion, these should result in the registration of around 41 0,000 properties representing 47
percent of total urban properties or 62 percent of unregistered urban properties.
CAS Outcome: Reductions in the timefor registration of land transfersfrom 47 days to 10 days
[Partially Achieved]
Registration of land transfers is down from 47 days in 2005 to 30 days for properties not previously
registered and 5-7 days for previously registered properties, in 2009'. A protracted, and later
Doing Business data for 2010 show a reduction to only 42 days, but this is measured both with a lag and in the
capital city only.

57

FY06-FY09 CAS Completion Resort

redesigned, procurement of information systems for the Immovable Properties Registration Office
under the LAMP was been a major factor in the slow progress to date.
CAS Outcome: Development of urban regulatoryplans for Tirana and 8 key secondary cities
[Partially Achieved]
After a four-year-long process supported by a Bank-supervised trust fund from the Netherlands
government, the new Tirana urban regulatory plan was completed in 2009. However, owing to
protracted disputes between the national and municipal governments, it has not yet been approved nor,
notably, has the consulting firm been paid for its services. Nevertheless, under the Land Administration
and Management Project, after another protracted contracting process new regulatory planning
exercises were launched and are underway for eight additional municipalities.
CAS Outcome: 150 km of coastal zone with orderly land-use plans [Not Achieved]
Following the adoption of the South Coast Development Plan and regulations, and as a result of an
Inspection Panel case, Bank-support for preparation of land use plans in the southern coast of Albania
has been cancelled. It is expected that the Government will continue with these planning exercises, but
given the limited capacity in this area at both the national and local government levels, progress is
expected to be relatively slower than it might have been with Bank involvement.
CAS Outcome: Provision of key secondary cities with improved urban infrastructure [Partially
Achieved]
Under the Municipal Water and Wastewater Project (closed in 2009), the Integrated Water and
Ecosystem Management Project (closed in 2009), and the Integrated Coastal Zone Management and
Clean-up Project, the Bank supported significant improvements in water supply and investments in
sewerage and wastewater treatment in Durres, Fier, Lezha, Himara and Saranda. Delays under the
infrastructure component on the Land Administration and Management Project, meant that no
infrastructure has been yet completed for the eight cities under the project.
CAS Outcome: Provision of coastal communities with improved infrastructure to help support
environmentally sustainable tourism [Achieved]
Under the ICZMCP, three coastal municipalities and twelve coastal villages benefited from small
infrastructure projects. These infrastructure improvements included several access roads to the beach or
historical monuments (castle and monastery), repairing or extension of water supply systems and
sewage water collection, as well parking places and rehabilitation or re-surfacing of village roads.
Larger investments are ongoing to upgrade the passenger ferry terminal in Saranda port, construct a
regional solid waste landfill in Saranda and transfer station in Himara, and a sewage and water supply
extension within the tourist area in Saranda.

1.6
Country Development Goal: Support sustainable rural development to ensure continued
economic poverty reduction
Over the last decade rural poverty has declined steadily. While the national incidence of poverty fell
from 18 percent in 2005 to 12.4 percent in 2008, in rural areas the reduction was almost twice as fast,
falling from 24.2 to 14.6 percent. The depth and severity of poverty showed similar sustained declines.
Extreme poverty in rural areas is now only around 1.2 percent. In the central rural and coastal rural
areas, where the majority of the rural population is concentrated, poverty incidence has fallen to 11
58

FY06-FY09 CAS Corndetion Report

percent (from 26 in 2005) and 15 percent (from 20 in 2005), respectively. Poverty still remains highest
in the rural mountain areas, although it has declined from 50 to 30 percent between 2002-2005.
The agricultural sector has been growing steadily in recent years but at lower rates than the overall
economy. From 2000-08 it has grown at an average rate of 4 percent per year.
The CAS program included several projects aimed at increasing rural incomes and productivity: Water
Resource Management, Second Community Development, Fishery Development, Agricultural Services,
but also the Natural Resources Development Project (see also Country Development Goal 2.4,) and
more recently Secondary and Local Roads (see Pillar 1.4).
CAS Outcomes: Crop yield increases of 45%, 70%, and 40%for maize, avava, and vegetables in
rehabilitated irrigation areas [Partially Achieved]
The increases in crop yields were 42%, 55%, 23% for maize, alfalfa and vegetables. So, the targets are
substantially achieved, with the exception of vegetables.’
CAS Outcomes: 100% of rehabilitated irrigation canals managed by user associations [Achieved]
Under the Water Resources Management Project (closed in 2009) 36,000 ha of land was returned to
irrigation compared with a target of 50,000 ha, and over 34,500 ha were drained. All of the
rehabilitated channels are currently managed by either new pilot Water User Organizations or the
earlier established Water Unit Associations, with operating costs of about 44 percent of irrigation areas
paid in full (at least $12 per hectare) by users. In addition, 33 dams and reservoirs were rehabilitated,
exceeding the target of 13 under the project. The rehabilitated dams and reservoirs improved the
irrigable land downstream by about 26,860 ha.
CAS Outcomes: Increased supply of improved planting materials-25%
basic seeds by research stations [Achieved]

rise in multiplication of

Under the Agricultural Services Project, an increased access to improved seed supplies and planting
materials has taken place as measured by the number of varieties available and the increased
availability of high quality seeds. The number of varieties tested and available in National seed
catalogue are 81.48% of the farmers use certified seeds. There has been an increase in the local
production of breeder seeds and a multiplication of basic seeds by seed research stations. The planned
increases in the availability of seeddplanting materials per research station (Lushnja, Korca or Shkodra)
and varieties established in the Agriculture Service Project have been reached in most cases.
CAS Outcomes: Promotion of agricultural innovation - a t least 100 farmer groups witness
productivity gains by use of new technology, diversification, or access to new markets (Achieved]
Under the Agricultural Services Project, the Bank supported a competitive grants program which
provided grants of up to US$15,000 to farmers for using new technologies and accessing new markets.
Each recipient was also required to share these experiences through training, brochures and other
methods with other farmers. One hundred thirty-four (136) farmer groups grant-financed projects were
implemented and over 21,000 farmers were exposed to improved technology. Around 85 percent of the
direct beneficiaries obtained increases in annual income, with 30 percent showing increases of greater
than 10 percent.
CAS Outcomes: Annual increases of 20% in volume and diversity of goods traded in constructed
markets [Achieved]
Data reported in the CAS Progress Report erroneously referred to the pilot water users organizations, only.

59

FY06-FY09 CAS Completion Report

The volume of trade in the four completed markets" in Korca, Lushnja, Vlora and Shkodra increased
by more than 200 percent from an average of 50 tons per day in 2004 to 122 tons in 2008. The number
of traders increased by 60 percent; the number of farmers by 700 percent; contracted covered stores
reached 87 percent. The diversity of agricultural products traded increased from an average of 5 product
varieties in 2004 to 28 in 2008.

CAS Outcomes: Increase in sustainable marine and inlandfisk catch [Achieved]
The size and associated value of the marine fish catch has grown systematically from 2004 to 2008 -- at
an average increase in value of US$1.2 million per annum -- supported by the Bank through a Fishery
Development Project (closed in 2007). Four marine ports (Saranda, Vlora, Shengjin and Durres) were
rehabilitated and are being managed by community-based fishermen's associations. Rehabilitation of
three lake fish landing sites was completed, but the ones on Lakes Ohrid and Shkodra are not yet selffinancing. Increased capacity for aquaculture development has been pursued: carp fingerlings (Koran at
Lake Ohrid) are released yearly; estimated lake catch increased by 30%, and lake productivity increased
threefold. A total of 1,482 individuals, representing vessel owners and fishery workers, and in-land
fishermen are registered as members of 13 Fishery Management Organizations. Training at the
Shkodra Lake was completed and improved surveillance takes place with the introduction of vesseltracking systems linked with coast guards.

PILLAR
2: Improved Service Delivery, particularly in the Social Sectors
2.1

Country Development Goal: Improved quality of, and equity in a c c e ~ to,
s education

sewices

Overall progress toward this country goal was modest over the CAS period, but perceptible. The Bank
has contributed to this goal through Albania's first SWAP project - the Education, Excellence and
Equity Project, which was mainstreamed into the Ministry of Education. The project has had some
delays but is associated with a number of institutional developments across the sector.
Administrative data show that between 2005 and 2009 enrolment rates at every level increased, e.g.,
from 48 to 50 percent in early childhood development services, from 54 to 60 percent in secondary
education (project target is 75 percent), and by more than 20 percent for higher education. The
standard deviation of per student expenditure in pre-university education across regions has declined
from 4,435 Lek in 2005 to 2,388 Lek in 2009, but rural secondary enrolment rates remains less than
one-third of urban. Rural students also perform worse than
their urban peers, scoring on average 7
*
points less on the Matura literature exam, for example.
Learning conditions have been improving - particularly the problem of over-crowding. The share of
students in multiple-shift classrooms fell from 34.5 to 17.7 percent in primary schools and from 7.7 to
5.7 in secondary schools. School infrastructure planning and investments under the Education
Excellence and Equity Project, albeit delayed, should help to further to decreasing over-crowding.
New curricula have been introduced in basic and secondary education. The latter has started on a
rolling basis, is modular and allows greater choice of content. New textbooks have been developed and
distributed in support of this curriculum and teachers have been familiarized with the new materials.
An Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) curriculum was introduced in 2009, all ICT
teachers have been trained, and over 2000 basic and secondary schools have been equipped with
computer labs. The students per computer ratio fell from 61 in 2005 to 25 in 2009, while in rural areas it
10

60

FY06-FY09 CAS Completion Report

has improved even more dramatically from 148 into 27. However, more progress is needed with respect
to strengthening digital libraries and e-schools.
At the higher education level, the project is supporting a management/governance reform effort under
which all of the public universities have established public boards and 70 percent have prepared new
strategic plans.
CAS Outcome: Net secondary enrollment increases from 53% in 2005 to 72% in 2009 [Partially
Achieved]
The net secondary enrollment rate increased from 53 percent in 2005 to 60 percent in 2009. However,
this indicator may understate the improvement for several reasons. First, the school system was
changed in 2008 from 8 years of basic and 4 years of secondary, to 9 and 3 years, respectively. As a
result the number of secondary classrooms increased by 25 percent, and the improved conditions are
reported to have encouraged some further enrollment: 11 percent more secondary students were
graduated in 2009 than 2008. Second, population projections may not have captured the rapid
demographic movements in recent years. Concerns remain about the rural areas, where enrollment
remained at 26 percent in 2009 (the target is 32 percent) compared with 88 percent in urban areas
(exceeding that target by 3 percent).
CAS Outcome: Completion of curriculum reform in basic education by 2008 [Achieved]
Since 2008, all basic schools are implementing a new 9-grade curriculum, for which students have the
relevant textbooks and teachers have been trained.
CAS Outcome: Completion of curriculum reform in secondary education by 2010 [Achieved]
The new curriculum for the first grade of secondary education has been approved and is being
implemented during the 2009-20 10 school year. The curriculum reform for second and thirds grades of
secondary school has been launched in 2009 and the new curricula will be implemented in 2010-1 1, and
201 1-12, respectively.
CAS Outcome: 15% of schools withfunctioning school boards and school improvement plans by
2009 [Achieved]
In 2008, Albania introduced school boards in all of its 2,015 schools. To date, about 400 of these
school boards (20 percent) have developed school improvement plans.
CAS Outcome: Standard deviation of per capita student expenditures by regions reducedfrom 4,000
Lek to 3,000 Lek by 2009 [Achieved]
By end 2008, the standard deviation of per student expenditure in pre-university education was 2,238
Lek.

Albania’s health indicators show improvement, although they remain low for a lower middle income
country. The estimated infant mortality rate for Albania is 10.3 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2009
compared with 15.1 in 2004. The MDG for 2005 was 14.7. The maternal mortality rate is estimated at
0 deaths in 2009, compared with 16.7 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2006 and 21.3 deaths in 2003.
However, the Bank contribution to this goal through the Health System Modernization Project has been
limited to institutional and capacity improvements outlined below, owing to delays in its
implementation. The 2006 PEIR indicated that although public health expenditures remain low, critical
improvements in the health financing and spending mechanisms were recommended to precede any

61

FY06-FY09 CAS Completion Report

increase in public financing. This study informed the design of the Health Sector Management Project
(HSMP) to focus on quality and efficiency improvements as a first step. Nevertheless, in some regions,
access to essential hospital services has improved due to investments in road infrastructure, notably in
Vlora and Shkodra under the Road Maintenance Project. It is expected that such improvements will
continue with the Secondary and Local Roads program which has as one of the investment allocation
criteria, travelling time for local communities to schools and hospitals. Under the Bank financed
emergency Avian Influenza Project, Albania benefited from improvements in diagnostic capacity at the
Institute of Public Health, and the regular vaccination of at-risk populations against the seasonal
influenza.
CAS Outcome: Allocation of public funding based on health needs and primary care providerstarget: establishment of performance contracts with 5 hospitals by 2009 [Partially Achieved]
The Health Insurance Institute (HII) assumed responsibility for funding all operating costs for primary
health care in 2000. The financing arrangements with primary health care providers include
performance incentives. In addition, since 2009, the HI1 has taken over the responsibility of funding all
hospitals as well. Currently contracts are in place between HI1 and the hospitals, but performance
incentives are not yet being implemented. Meanwhile, steps are being taken to improve health sector
management and governance, with a view of allowing health care providers more autonomy in resource
allocation and decision-making. University training of 12 trainers has been completed in hospital
management and financial management. These trainers have successfully completed training of 150
health system managers while training of other 100 managers is under implementation.
CAS Outcome: Establishment of formal co-payment system yielding 20% reduction in reported
informal payments in target regions by 2009 [Partially Achieved]
A modern legislative framework for health financing is being introduced. As a related and necessary
step, the new Health Care Law was adopted in 2009 replacing a 1967 law on the books. This new law
includes a system for physician licensing and private health care provision. The Government has
introduced co-payments for prescription drugs for all beneficiaries, established a more controlled list of
drugs eligible for coverage, and revised its policy to limit reimbursement to drugs that have similar
therapeutic effects and are the cheapest available. Results of the Living Standards Measurement Study
(LSMS) on co-payments or informal payments are forthcoming, but sector experts surmise that the 20
percent reduction has not yet been achieved.
CAS Outcome: Improved quality of health care services through use of evidence-based Clinical
Practice Guidelines (CPGs) in 32 key diseases [Partially Achieved]
The institutional framework has been established for development of CPG. After careful analysis of the
disease pattern in Albania, it was agreed that the target of developing CPGs for 32 diseases was not
appropriate, and that it was more important to focus only on six key diseases. So far, CPGs for five key
diseases have been developed and are currently under implementation, while work is in progress for the
sixth one. Training is being provided to practitioners with the objective of reaching 70 % compliance
with CPGs by end 20 10.
CAS Outcome: Complete training of 100% Primary Health Care physicians and nurses in 7 regions
by 2009 [Achieved]
The quality improvement training for primary care providers is under implementation. So far, all
primary health care physicians and nurses have been trained in 6 regions, while work is in progress for
the remaining 6 regions in the country. The licensing system with basic requirements for all health care
institutions and professionals has been established. The objective is that all physicians are licensed

62

FY06-FY09 CAS Corndetion ReDort

based on licensing guidelines. About 210 staff members have been trained and the licensing and
accreditation function is already integrated into the Center for Quality and Accreditation.

23

Country Development G Q ~Improve
:
provision of social security and assistance services

and their sustainability

Improvement in selected areas has taken place. While some measures, including reduction of payroll
contributions from 39 to 24 percent and reduction of fraud leading to lower expenditures, were
undertaken the remaining reforms needed to secure fiscal sustainability have yet to be agreed or
initiated. Moreover, the Government has continued with ad hoc pension increases that limit the future
space for reform. On the other hand, significant progress has been made in social assistance and social
services, supported by the Social Services Delivery Project (SSDP). The national strategy for social
services and assistance was prepared and is under implementation. New national service standards for
all vulnerable groups were produced and are being implemented. The number of recipient of these
social care services has increased more than ten-fold. Local governments have assumed full financial
responsibility for and are replicating the social care centers established under SSDP. An assessment of
the factors underlying targeting performance indicates that much is owed to the efforts of local officials
to reach their poor, except in rural areas where the efforts of the center and local officials contribute
equally. In the Government’s main social assistance program NE a large share of the benefits is still
captured by wealthier households, and the NE benefits represent a modest share of the total pre-transfer
consumption of the poor because the NE benefits are low, due to limited funding. Major improvements
are needed to improve targeting. The Government has plans for a major overhaul of the social
assistance system which will be supported under the new CPS. The main focus of the reform
potentially would include the improvement in eligibility criteria, administration of benefits, monitoring
and evaluation, and the computerization of the system.
CAS Outcomes: Improved delivery of social care services through (a) a 50% increase in access of
vulnerable groups to effective social care services in at least 8 regions, and (b) 70% of social care
services in selected regions to meet their performance targets by 2009 [Achieved]
There has been a substantial increase in the access of vulnerable groups to daily social care services. A
total of 43 daily care centers are in place in 8 regions, established under the SSDP, servicing almost
25,000 persons (directly and indirectly). This should be compared with 26 centers servicing 1,300
persons in 2000. The quality of care in residential services has been increased with 19 out of 26
residential care centers (73 percent) provide services in accordance with standards of social care and/or
specific standards for elderly and disabled.
CAS Outcomes: Improvements in targeted cash transfers for social assistance: (a) at least 30% of
poor households receive cash social assistance, and (b) 90% of social assistance goes to poor
households [Partially Achieved]
There has been some progress regarding public policy planning which has been translated into policy
making and outcomes. Options for improved targeting for cash social assistance have been identified
and appraised. A national strategy on the NE is completed and approved by the Government. LSMS
2008 results show that over 30 percent of the poor households currently receive NE assistance but no
data is yet available to confirm that 90 percent of social assistance goes to poor households.
CAS Outcomes:Adoption of a pension policy and administrative reform program to achievefiscal
sustainability [Partially Achieved]
Some achievements have been made in pension administration but no policy reform proposal or
strategy has yet been agreed by Government. Bank support to pension reforms and administrative
improvements has been channeled through the SSDP and the DPO reform program. Although a policy

63

FY06-FY09 CAS Completion Report

option paper was completed and adopted by the Strategic Planning Committee, there were significant
delays in the formation of the pension policy working group to develop more specific reform proposals.
The working group was subsequently expanded to include members of opposition parties in recognition
that a broad-based consensus on the objectives and specific reforms is critical. However, its work was
halted by the 2009 elections and has yet to be revitalized. Meanwhile, the Social Insurance Institute has
moved to reduce fraud by securing records and improving the registration of contributions. With Bank
support, the Social Insurance Institute is refurbishing and expanding its archives and has started the
digitalization of its records. The Bank has also supported, with TA, revisions of the legal framework
for the voluntary pension system in 2009.

Country Development Goal: Poverty reduction through incame increases and improved
2.4
service delivery in both urban and rural areas
The period 2005-08 witnessed a particularly strong reduction of poverty, with the incidence declining
from 24.2 to 14.6 percent. At the same time extreme poverty has fallen to 1.2 percent. These
reductions are in line with the goal of lowering poverty incidence to 10 percent and eradicating extreme
poverty by 201 5. While the majority of the poor still live in rural areas, that share has fallen from 68
percent to 60 percent between 2002 and 2008. There are however emerging tiny pockets of extreme
urban poverty with rates higher than in some rural areas.
The CAS program has contributed to improving infrastructural service delivery and incomes through
projects supporting municipal water and wastewater, forestry, community works, municipal and coastal
infrastructure. Good progress on water and sanitation has been made during the CAS period. The share
of the population connected to the piped water network is around 74 percent (87 percent in urban
municipalities and 47 percent in the rural communes). The corresponding coverage of sewerage is only
47 percent (68 percent in municipalities but only 3 percent in the rural communes). Improvements in
the rural and peri-urban infrastructure are taking place, and the Government's objective to reach 45
percent of the population with access to waste water treatment by 2013 seems feasible. Clarification of
responsibilities across agencies and communities for provision and maintenance of rural transport
infrastructure is in progress under the ongoing Secondary and Local Roads Project with Bank financing.

CAS Outcomes: Improved access to and quality of urban water supplyfor 300,000people in Durres,
Saranda, Fier, and Lezhe [Achieved]
Through the Municipal Water and Waste Water Project, the Bank assisted Albania to improve water
and sanitation services in four participating cities and achieve financial viability. A new incentive-based
multi-city management contract approach was introduced. Participating water utilities engaged a private
operator through management contract to take over operation and maintenance of existing facilities.
Water availability increased in participating municipalities: the average hours increase 2-3 times in
most cases (availability is between 3 and 20 hours per day, depending on the municipality). Percentage
of total connected population in service area receiving at minimum 2 hours of water supply per day is
about 100 percent in these cities. Collection rates are between 56 and 8 1 percent, which requires further
improvement although it is much better than in the past. Wastage and over-consumption of water has
been reduced. This has had a positive impact on the finances of the public utilities. Management of the
broader water and waste water sector is improving. All 54 water and waste water utilities are monitored
on a monthly basis. A Monitoring and Benchmarking Unit (within Government) issues six-monthly and
annual reports.

CAS Outcomes: Improved access to urban sanitation in Saranda municipality and wastewater
treatment in Durres, Saranda, and Lezhe/Shengjin [Partially Achieved]
The Bank contributed to these CAS outcomes through the Global Environment Project for Integrated
Water and Ecosystem Management (US$Smillion) which twinned with EIB to support the development
of three large sewerage treatment plants in the three coastal areas. The project closed with an

64

FY06-FY09 CAS Completion Report

unsatisfactory rating in December 2009, because the plants have yet to be complete owing to delays in
Government counterpart financing for EIB co-financing and EC parallel financing. Nevertheless it is
anticipated that by mid 201 1, through this support, Albania will have significantly increased the
coverage of wastewater treatment in these environmentally and economically critical coastal areas.
CAS Outcomes: Local community management of 660,000ha of upland erosion-prone land using
sustainable natural resource management plans (Achieved]

With Bank, GEF and Swedish Government assistance under the Natural Resources Development
Project (NRDP), the participatory communal forest and pasture management plans (which include
defined, agreed and mapped usufruct rights) have been introduced in 250 communes that cover 644,739
ha. To support this measure, the Government transferred in 2008, ownership of 60 percent of country’s
forest and pasture lands or 754,148 ha to local governments. Erosion reduction measures have been
established; erosion reduction is estimated at 150,000 tons to date. The target for the year 2010 is to
reduce erosion by 200,000 ton, which is likely to be achieved given that implementation of microcatchment plans is ongoing in 30 communes and forest and management plans in 190 communes.
CAS Outcomes: 10% increase in economic benefitsfrom sustainable use of natural resources at the
contmune or village level (Achieved]

The implementation of the plans financed under NRDP provides much needed seasonal employment
opportunities to the rural poor, involving some 6000 workers, including 1900 women and 1900
beneficiary families, fi-om Project start up to the present time. Preliminary assessment shows a 41
percent increase in average annual household income derived from sustainable use of forest and
pasture resources. Another promising result relates to the fact that communes started establishing
grazing fees from January 2009. The Project is also supporting carbon sequestration measures in
degraded lands through tree planting, assisted natural regeneration and control of animal grazing in 24
communes (6272.36 ha ) that are among the poorest in the country, with a median poverty rate of 42
percent. Almost two-thirds of them rank in the lowest third of the poverty distribution as measured by
“percent families poor”.

World Bank portfolio performance

As of end-December 2009, there were 15 active projects with an average size of US$18 million, and
original commitment of $268 million in the Albania portfolio. This does not include an additional
US$78 million Partial Risk Guarantee for the electricity distribution privatization. Since the beginning
of the CAS period, eleven other projects (including a GEF and DPL) were completed. The total
commitment during the CAS period was US$400 million for 25 projects with an average size of US$16
mi 11ion.

As of end December 2009, 78percent of the commitments on the ongoing portfolio have satisfactory
performance. Two projects in the transport sector are rated as highly satisfactory,four others as
satisfactory,and six as moderately satisfactory,on implementation performance. All three projects
which are rated unsatisfactory have recently been restructured. As such, proactivity over the CPS
period was 100 percent. Eighty-six ( 8 6 ) percent of the completed commitments were rated satisfactory
or moderately satisfactory. Of the ten completed projects, two were rated unsatisfactory, three
moderately satisfactory and five satisfactory.

Albania received just over 50 percent more IDA commitments than programmed, mainly on account
of its high level of demand, but contracting two projects with regional significance in FY08 - Disaster
Risk Mitigation and Dam Safety.”
On the other hand, IBRD lending was around half that
programmed (not including the Partial Risk Guarantee), in part because of the withdrawal of remaining
DPO series.
The lending program proceeded as anticipated with three notable exceptions. The second and third
operations in the Development Policy series were ultimately dropped. Two essentially “global public
good” operations were committed: the emergency Avian Influenza Preparedness (FY05) and Disaster
Risk Mitigation and Adaptation (FY08)12. And finally, the ICZMCP I1 was replaced with Secondary
and Local Roads Project.

Optimization of Albania’s immense hydropower generating capacity will support more efficient balancing of
power in the region, once complete.
As part of this operation, Albania is the first country in Eastern Europe to contract a loan for entry into the
Climate Change Risk Insurance Facility, and was an early demander for the Catastrophic Deferred Drawdown
Operation, until the exposure rules were changed which made this contingent financing a much less attractive
lending instrument.

FY06-FY09 CAS Completion ReDort

There is little evidence of reduced demand for Bank lending in view of the graduation from IDA in
2009. But, as expected, technical assistance components are more carefully scrutinized by the
authorities, and the Bank has been encouraged to partner with the remaining concessional windows
available to Albania. In this regard, 7 of the 10 new loadcreditd3 committed in the CAS benefit from
substantial eo-financing or coordinated parallel financing. The most notable are the Sector Wide
Approach Program in the education sector (Bank financing is one-fifth of a US$75 million sector
program) and the Secondary and Local Roads Project (Bank-financed project of US$20 million has
triggered a program of nearing US$350 million in parallel financing).
Esforts to consolidate the portfolio toward the CAS target of 12 projects were delayed by the
continued high demand in the face of a gradually closing window for IDA resources, and addition of
two small projects related to global and regional public goods (namely Avian Influenza and Disaster
Risk Mitigation and Adaptation Program). However, the current portfolio of 15 projects averaging $1 8
million continued the trend toward larger projects. It compares with the portfolio at the onset of the
2002 CAS which had 21 projects averaging US$13 million, and in 2005 with 15 projects averaging
US$15 million.
The country program also included 26 trust funds and one Fee-Based Service during the CAS period,
including several grant co-financing trust funds for projects and the Japan Policy and Human Resources
Development Fund (PHRD) preparation grants. This does not include full sized Global Environmental
Projects, of which Albania has benefited from three during the CAS period (one is now closed). Of
these 16 are ongoing, of which 1 1 are project co-financing grants,

The average age of projects in portfolio is 4.5 years, slightly higher than the Bank and ECA at 3.7,
3.8 years, respectively. There are two significantly older projects. The Social Service Delivery Project,
at 8.6 years, was extended from its original 6 year implementation period to utilize cost savings and
later additional financing for investments in pension administration. The Power Sector Generation and
Restructuring Project is 5.8 years but is expected to close in the next few months.
The disbursement rate in the CASperiod, and as well in FY09, was 21 percent, compared with 18-19
percent in Europe and Central Asia and 24-27 percent Bank-wide. Disbursement rates fluctuated
during the CAS period, but have on average remained rather low, reflecting in part delays associated
with the mainstreaming of project implementation into line ministries forgoing the use of free-standing
PIUS, - (Education, Health, Natural Resources, and Business Environment), and several protracted
procurement for larger contracts, such as for transmission substations, regulatory impact assessment
TA, and computerization for property registry office and health information system.

The completion cost of loans/credits has declined during the CPS period, from $422,000 per
operation in FY06 to $348,000 in FY09I4. Together with the increasing average loadcredit size and
projecUprogram size, this suggests an increasing efficiency in the delivery of the lending program.

including the SSDP Additional Financing and the Partial Risk Guarantee
The information refers to “completion costs”, that is cumulative costs of operations approved in the referred
years, including expenditures incurred in previous years. Therefore this cost refers to projects delivered
during the CAS period and not to all projects under implementation. The same criteria were used for AAAs.

67

FY06-FY09 CAS Completion Revort

However, the average cost $382,000 to deliver a loadcredit during the CAS period was 40 percent over
the regional reference cost or ?coefficient?, mainly on account of five high cost deliveries DPL 11,
Transport, LAMP, BERIS, HSMP, and EEEP. The Bank spent around $86,000 per project in
supervision during this CAS period, close to the reference point. A decision was taken mid CAS period
to allocate more resources to more complex or riskier projects such as the EEEP, ICZMCP and LAMP.
Meanwhile, decentralization which led to local task team leadership of seven of the 25 projects covered
during the CAS period and helped to contain costs. The costs of analytical and advisory activities
(AAA) were more irregular. The average cost of an AAA task was $150,000, exceeding the
?coefficient? or reference by 25 percent. Finally, ?overhead? costs (?other) as a proportion of the
annual budget for delivering the Albania CAS program have been increasing in relative terms: it went
from about 12 percent in FY06 to about 22 percent in FY08 and FY0915. The overall budget is
contracting faster than ?other? costs. In any case, an ?overhead? cost of over 20 percent seems on the
high side and needs to be examined.
Mainstreaming project implementation.

Under the CAS, the Bank continued to mainstream project implementation into line ministry
structures though this sometimes caused temporary delays as ministry staff coped with unfamiliar
Bankprocedures.. While this effort has helped to build capacity in line ministries - notably, Ministries
of Finance, Education and Economy, Trade & Energy, Public Works - and in KESH, in many cases it
resulted in a slowing of project disbursements as ministry staff struggled to meet additional burden of
project administration. The most notable examples are in the Education SWAP, the Health Sector
Modernization Project, Land Administration and Management Project, Business Environment Reform
and Institutional Support Project and the Disaster Risk Mitigation and Adaptation Project.
From the Bank side, project design often did not take into sufficient account the challenges of
mainstreaming. The most notable case is in Health Sector Modernization Project where the original
procurement plan included a very large number of small packages whose processing was being
mainstreamed into a ministry with traditionally weak capacity. In Ministry of Education (Education
Excellence and Equity Project) and the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Energy (Business Environment
Reform and Institutional Strengthening Project) the plethora of administrative steps in ministry decision
making apparatus ultimately led to the Bank making recommendations on the client?s own procedural
functions to ease project implementation. Another case is that of the LAMP which is being
implemented across three ministries, where the project encountered the perennial problem of interministerial coordination which is not yet firmly embedded in Albanian public administration. One
lesson is that, in addition, to fiduciary assessments, the Bank might require a much more integrated
assessment of functional and administrative capacities in beneficiary agencies where project
implementation is to be mainstreamed.
In the still politicized public sector, mainstreaming also meant that projects were vulnerable to the
high turnover of public officials; again Ministry of Health is a notable example where the minister has
been changed five times, to date, during project implementation, but similar situations also took place in
KESH, Ministry of Public Works, and Ministry of Education. While it is near impossible to anticipate
such changes, measures might be taken during supervision to ensure that a broad swath of ministry staff
understand the project in some detail.
Notwithstanding the above, the benefits of mainstreaming are clearly apparent. In the energy and
roads sectors, long engagement with Bank-financed projects and strong donor coordination, has led to
the establishment of Government-staffed project implementation structures that are familiar with donor
requirements and efficiently implement multiple donor programs. This includes the joint project unit in
KESH, the General Roads Directorate in the Ministry of Public Works, the Albanian Development

This is based on annual spending, which is not the same as the spending based on completion costs.

Fund, and Central Financing and Contracting Unit in the Ministry of Finance. Even in other ministries
where the number of donor-financed projects is few, such as Ministries of Education and Economy, a
recent Bank fiduciary review suggests that ministries have internalized some of the disciplines of Bank
project procedures.
Improving governance

To strengthen Albania’s weak governance - a critical development constraint -- the CASforesaw two
main instruments: (i) systematic application of a governance filter; and (ii) implementation of a set
of fiduciary measures. The governance filter approach specified key governance areas relevant for
Albania and aimed at mainstreaming them, i.e. ensuring that all CAS interventions included a specific
focus on one or more of them. Most of the projects approved after the CAS16had been discussed at the
Board included explicit commitments to the application of the Filter, while in older projects, the Filter
served to reemphasize the importance of components dealing with governance and institutional
development. This approach is currently being evaluated, inter alia, in a Governance Review which is
currently under preparation. The second instrument was a set of fiduciary measures geared to protect
Bank-financed projects but also to support the development of better country fiduciary systems. The
latter has since blossomed into a Fiduciary Action Plan, currently being implemented with support from
the Governance Partnership Facility. In terms of the various pillars of the Filter, Box 2 of the CAS
Progress Report summarizes most of the interventions up to that time. Since then, Albania has
benefitted as a CGAC country from some additional resources in FY08 used for starting
implementation on the Fiduciary Action Plan, training media, civil society and watchdog institutions on
governance indicators, procurement system reform and some sectoral interventions. Albania now has a
Bank-executed Governance Partnership Facility Window 1 program under implementation - which
focuses on more thorough governance diagnostics at the macro and micro level, implementation of the
Fiduciary Action Plan (mentioned above) and increasing interactions with civil society including in
project supervision.
Box 1: Albania’s protracted Treasury system development and its impact on the portfolio

The development of the Albania treasury system under the Public Administration Reform Project was
first under prepared during project design when a belated decision to introduce this component was
agreed. The subproject subsequently ran into implementation delays on account of the lack of
preparation and in particular client readiness. After several design changes, the system became
operational in the first half of 2007, just after the project closed. IEG’s Project Evaluation notes “The
Treasury Department is currently running the system in parallel with the previous system, and the full
operation is planned from January 2008. The implementation of the system is at a critical juncture.” In
anticipation of full operation, the Bank agreed to financial reporting of a number of new projects in this
CAS through the Treasury system, provided additional support from local Financial Management
officer and later through it supervision of the IPS Trust Fund. Today in by early 2010, full operation of
the system has not yet been achieved. Meanwhile, delays in financial reporting have contributed to
disbursement levels in a number of the Bank-financed projects which rely on the system. With
hindsight, a few lessons are important to note. First, four-year implementation period for automation
was too limited for a complex automation of this type. Second, although portfolio management dictated
the on-time closure of the project, it may have been better for the Bank to extend its support for some
months to help the Government ensure full operation of the system. Third, the impact of the client’s
lack of readiness to undertake such a project at the onset has persisted beyond the project closure.
The fiduciary commitments under this CAS included decentralization of financial management and
procurement staff; adjusting procurement thresholds to better reflect country risk; more procurement

audits and reviews; continuing support to audit and procurement agencies; and vigorously investigating
fraud. For most of the CAS period local FM and procurement staff were in place”. A recent Country
Fiduciary Review reports that (i) as a result of these actions, there has been a much closer degree of
scrutiny and ‘hand-holding’ of the Albania portfolio that is seen across the ECA region; (ii) this more
intensive supervision effort associated with local staffing and lower prior review thresholds has paid off
in terms of governance and capacity building- a number of good/best practices by contracting agencies
were identified, and (ii) fiduciary staff decentralization helped to contain the costs of this more
intensive supervision. Some lessons include the need to now improve contract management and to
share lessons/information across government. The added advantage of local fiduciary presence was the
ability to keep up the dialogue on the broader fiduciary reform agenda, in particular on Treasury system
development, procurement, and accounting and audit reform.
Safeguards policy implementation
During the CAS period, two Inspection Panel cases were investigated in Albania which yielded some
important lessons for project implementation as a whole. Investigations were undertaken on the
Integrated Coastal Zone Management and Clean-up Project and the Power Sector Generation and
Restructuring Project (“Vlore Power Plant”). In both cases, the findings of the Panel focused on
implementation of safeguard policies on (environment and resettlement). The main lessons from the
ICZMCP panel case pertain mainly to managerial and staffing issues, including that of carefully
matching team leadershipkomposition as well as the level of managerial oversight to project
complexity and risk, and of maintaining an environment conducive to frank discussion and resolution of
risks. However, in both cases, there are some lessons for program implementation, namely:
the need to raise the importance of safeguards implementation to the same level already afforded
to fiduciary controls in project preparation and implementation.
the role of the Bank in supervising the quality of consultations undertaken by the client in project
preparation and implementation;
the need for a renewed focus on social risks in Albania, in particular with respect to land and
property rights which remain an area of contention;
the need to fully explain the Bank’s policies, in particular on social risk mitigation, not only to
senior officials but all levels of project staffing especially in mainstreamed projects;
the need to continuously update the Bank’s knowledge of local laws and regulations when it
pertains to implementation of safeguard policies, both environmental and otherwise;
the importance of systematically addressing complaints from the public, including through a
proactive media and communications program that mitigates reputational risks; and
in small countries such as Albania to pay close attention to either perceived or actual conflict of
interests in project staffing.
Analytical and Advisory Services
The CAS lending program was accompanied by a substantial program of analytical and advisory
services and non-lending technical assistance from both the Bank and IFC. Overall the products were
well aligned with country and CAS goals. Several key economic and sector work products were
important forerunners to key lending operations and reform dialogues - notably

planned concession of the Durres container terminal; and
the Mining Sector Reform, Restructuring and Future Support which started as short mission
in response to a request from Government, and has yielded Albania’s candidacy for the
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.

The most recent AAA work is relevant to deal with the aftermath of the global crisis, namely the CEM,
Investment Climate Assessment (with a focus on innovation) and Social Policy technical assistance.
Finally there has been continuous flow of analysis and technical assistance on fiduciary agenda, ROSC
accounting and audit, corporate governance and alternative dispute resolution (ADR), a Governance
Review and study on accountability in the social sectors to help further refine the governance agenda in
the future.

IFC and World Bank activities strategically complemented each other particularly in the energy
sector and in private sector development. As of April 2009, IFC committed portfolio in Albania was
US$81.7 million, allocated to the general manufacturing sector (98 percent) and the financial sector (2
percent). During FY07-09, IFC has financed 5 projects for a total of US$96.5 million as compared to
US$76.9 million in 3 projects during FY04-06. IFC’s main strategic objective during FY06-09 was to

ANNEX3: RESULTS OF 2009/10 ALBANIA
CLIENT SURVEY
In February 2010, World Bank stakeholders were asked to participate in a Country Survey, to assess their
views of the World Bank and its work in Albania. The survey was sent to a range of opinion leaders,
including government, civil society, NGOs, media, private sector, and academia. A total of 200
stakeholders responded - a 73 percent response rate.
Overall the Client Survey suggests that stakeholders are quite satisfied with the Bank’s work in Albania,
and the relationships they have with the Bank (see Survey Question B2 graph below). They expressed
positive views of the Bank’s relevance, its alignment with country development priorities, and the way it
works in the country. Slightly more than half of respondents reported that the Bank should be more
involved in Albania’s development strategies while 44% said that the Bank was currently involved at an
optimum level. Finally stakeholders from all groups were quite positive about the Bank’s overall
effectiveness in Albania.
A number of important survey findings emerged that the country team has considered in the new CPS.
These include:
In terms of the work it is doing, the Bank is perceived by respondents to be focused on the areas that they
consider top priority, for the most part. The survey findings indicate that stakeholders are concerned
deeply with issues related to law, justice and governance, and a plurality believes that private sector
growth is the key to economic growth. The survey findings suggest that the Bank’s overall strategic
focus in Albania - identified by respondents as primarily poverty, growth, government effectiveness,
infrastructure - is fairly well aligned with what stakeholders think the Bank should be focused on:
economic growth, property rights, education, governance (see Survey Question C2b, below).
Other sectoral priorities identified by respondents include agricultural development, preparation for EU
membership, environmental impact of World Bank programs and helping to safeguard against corruption
in Bank programs (all of which receive relatively positive ratings in terms of Bank effectiveness). While
ratings on the Bank’s support for education and private sector are not terribly low, the Bank’s work in
these areas is not perceived as positively as its work in other sectors. This is of note because of
stakeholders’ interest in these sectors, in terms of overall development in Albania.
In terms of its outreach and relationships, the survey findings suggest that the Bank should work more
with local government and the private sector (see Survey Question C7, below). The latter group is of note
when considering the view expressed strongly in the survey that private sector growth is critical to overall
economic growth in Albania. This stakeholder group is significantly less familiar with the Bank than
nearly all other audiences; this may be an important area for greater collaboration with the IFC.
Stakeholders expressed concern in the survey about public disclosure. When asked what the Bank’s
greatest weakness was in Albania, a plurality of respondents reported that the Bank does not provide
enough public disclosure of its work with the government. This may reflect an overall concern with
transparency.
Nearly fifty percent of respondents reported that they had used the Public Information Center in Tirana.
This far exceeds use of PICS in most countries surveyed, even with a reported nearly 100% internet
access. Nine out of ten respondents said they had used the World Bank website (more use the local
website than the corporate website) with a high level of satisfaction reported.

ANNEX
4: STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS ON THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY
CPS Preparation Steps. As early as June 2009, IFC hosted the Bank and IFC country teams at a 2-day
workshop in Istanbul, facilitated by the IDA-IFC Secretariat, to brainstorm about possible cooperation in
a variety of infrastructure and social service sectors as well as on work on the business environment. The
workshop was followed by a country team meeting in September 2009 in Albania.

The formal process of consultation with the Government was launched in January 20 10 with a workshop
chaired by the Ministry of Finance and the Department of Strategy and Donor Coordination (DSDC) at
which line ministries presented their proposal for future support. This was then followed by discussions
with the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers, led on the Bank’s side by the Regional Vice
President. These meetings were followed by another round of discussions with the line ministries, prior
to the beginning the internal CPS drafting and processing steps.
Following another round of meetings with the line ministries, the Ministry of Finance, DSDC and the
Office of the Prime Minister, broader stakeholder consultations were also held with the Parliament
through its Committee on Economy and Finance (which includes opposition members), the central bank,
representatives of the private sector and civil society, and external development partners. The
consultations provided a venue for meaningful discussions with stakeholders on the content of the
proposed CPS program, the modalities for development interventions in Albania, and, especially, the role
of the Bank in supporting improvements in governance and transparency.
Feedbackfrom Consultations. The main feedback from the Parliamentary Commission on Economy and
Finance was related to the design of conditionality for budget support which Commission Members felt
should be very focused on a few key issues. In addition, several members suggested that the Bank focus
in depth on macroeconomic policy (particularly in the absence of a Fund program and local presence) and
regularly publish analytic reviews on macroeconomic performance. The need for a more focused and
consolidated World Bank Group program was also a key theme sounded by Commission Members, who
expressed concerns about the slow rate of project implementation.
Civil society continued to challenge the Bank to foster more public debate on governance,
macroeconomic issues as well as broader development concerns. Representatives also suggested a more
cross-sectoral approach in addressing key challenges, e.g. the impact of transport on school enrolment or
Representatives from environmental

organizations welcomed the focus on addressing climate challenges, but warned that without greater
investment in solid waste management Albania stood to permanently damage its natural heritage. The
civil society welcomed the new Access to Information Policy and the Bank’s plans to engage nongovernmental stakeholders in the monitoring project implementation and results.
The private sector representatives suggested that the Bank and other donors’ efforts to address the
business environment may be spread too thinly and unanimously argued for renewed attention to
functioning of the tax and customs administration. They also reiterated the importance of accurate and
timely national economic statistics to help private investors and entrepreneurs plan carefully in a
challenging environment, and the critical binding constraint related to security of property rights and the
functioning of land administration
Donors welcomed the Bank’s continued efforts to partner with other financiers, and invited the Bank to
join in the EU-European bilateral donors division of labor initiative. They also argued for an increasing
Bank Group role in addressing the informal economy and helping raise private sector capacities.

ANNEX6: GENDER
ASSESSMENT
Figure 1 below presents selected indicators of gender achievement and gender inequality, benchmarking
Albania (in yellow) against the Western Balkans (in green) and the ECA region (in red)." As all figures
are standardized to the ECA average it is easy to see the areas where Albania and the Western Balkans
perform very differently from the rest of the region.
For education, there are limited gender differences in secondary enrolment, and an interesting pattern
emerges for tertiary. While tertiary enrolments for women are much lower than the ECA average, the
ratio of male to female enrolment is very high. Even if a similar pattern holds in the Western Balkans, in
Albania it appears more pronounced. Maternal mortality stands out as a big outlier in Albania as opposed
to other countries in the region even though the share of births attended by health personnel (not shown)
is at the ECA average. Another interesting dimension in which Albania appears to stand out against the
rest of the region is fertility. Adolescent fertility rates are lower than ECA and the rest of the Western
Balkans (though overall fertility is much higher than in the region). While the female share in the total
labour force is comparable to the regional one, female employment is more concentrated in agriculture
than in other countries.

Focusing on national data provides an opportunity to look more closely at the socio-economic
characteristics of women and how they differ fiom those of men. Data on the labour market confirm a
very gendered division of labour, with women much less likely than men to be engaged in market
activities - women's activity rate is at 50 percent compared to 71 percent for men. As a result, only 43
percent of the economically active population is female. The limited coverage of preschool services (only

'*The indicators presented are limited by data availability. For the sake of comparability the indicators refer to the

latest year for which the indicators are available for the majority of the countries being compared. The data
referred to in this figure, therefore, might not be the most updated for Albania.

40 percent of children attend kindergarten) and of other gender friendly services helps explain the low
levels of labour market participation.

Women not only are less likely to be engaged in market activities, they also are less likely to be in the
sectors which before the crisis experienced marked employment growth, such as construction. Trend data
show that during the decade to 2006 female stagnated, while male employment increased. Firm level
surveys confirm this picture, with only 37 percent of women as full time workers, and with only 9 percent
of full time non-production workers being women. While this is in line with the regional performance,
only 11 percent of firms in 2007 had women participating in their ownership, against an ECA average
more than 3 times as high.
While younger women are gradually closing the gap v i s - h i s men in terms of human capital, access to
other type of capital remain tilted toward better access by men. For example, the law guarantees equality
of property rights, but men typically remain the official owners, while many women have difficulty
exercising their rights to access to propertym other than land. Similarly, limited de facto access to loans
is seen as one of key constraints limiting female entrepreneurship.
The persistence of some of the starkest aspects of gender inequality emerges from recent data on domestic
violence. According to a recent survey run by the Statistical Office (UNICEF-INSTAT 2009) 3 1 percent
of women experienced physical violence, and 13 percent sexual violence in their marriage or relationship,
with psychological and emotional abuse even more widespread. Less than 30 percent of the victims
sought help, and more than 90 percent of those who did relied on their family rather than formal
institutions, which appear to be inadequate. Another form of violence, trafficking which in Albania is
linked to the exploitation of prostitution, has been criminalized in 2001, though many of the problems in
the institutional response (such as the criminalization of the victims) remain pervasive.
Finally, while traditional gender roles remain strong, steps are being taken to address asymmetries in the
system. With regards to participation in decision making, for example, the 2009 Electoral Code
introduced a 30 percent gender quota. The representation of women in parliament in 2009 doubled from
previous elections reaching 23 female deputies (16 percent of the total, compared to 7 percent in the
previous parliament and 15 percent of the ECA average). However, that the Central Election
Commission did not apply the sanctions provided for in the Electoral Code to the lists that did not meet
the quota.

ANNEX7: CLIMATE CHANGE IN ALBANIA
The dominant challenge for Albania related to climate change today is ?Adaptation? to already on-going
climate change and the impacts this is likely to pose on the Albanian economy and livelihoods.
According to the 2009 Europe and Central Asia World Bank flagship report ?Managing Uncertainty:
Adapting to Climate Change in Europe and Central Asia? - Albania is ranked second among ECA
countries in terms of the impact index which captures the relative strength of future climate change
relative to today?s natural variability.?g,20

Over 90% of Albania?s electricity is generated from hydroelectric plants with implications for

The incidence and impact of natural disasters over the last few decades (in terms of the
percentage population affected);

Notes: The index combines the number of additional hot, dry and wet years; hot, dry and wet summers; and hot,
dry and wet winters projected over the 2070-2100 period relative to the 1961-1990 period. As such, countries
already experiencing substantial variability and extremes are less likely to rank highly on this index (e.g., India
and the Czech Republic have about the same score).
2o Our vulnerability index combines three sub-indices capturing a country?s exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive
capacity. The first, exposure, is based on an index measuring the strength of future climate change relative to
today?s natural variability (Baettig et ai. 2007). The index is available on a country basis and includes both
annual and seasonal temperature and precipitation indicators. It combines the number of additional hot, dry and
wet years; hot, dry and wet summers; and hot, dry and wet winters projected over the 2070-2100 period relative
to the 1961-1990 period. This suggests that the countries most exposed to future climatic change are Russia,
Albania, Turkey, Armenia and, to a lesser extent, Macedonia and Tajikistan.

Over 10% of the population lives in low level and exposed coastal zone areas; which are
prone to the effects of sea level rise, storm surges, saltwater infiltration into aquifers, floods,

A decline in mean precipitation of 8%; a decline in annual water availability for crops
(runoff) by 28%; thus irrigated small-holder farms may be hard hit by droughts and heat
waves (50% of all crops are irrigated);
Although climate change mitigation measures are also important for Albania, the carbon
intensity of the existing economy is not as high as other ECA countries as measured by

ANNEX9: COUNTRY
FINANCING
PARAMETERS
The country financing parameters for Albania set out below were approved by the Regional Vice
President, Europe and Central Asia in March 2005.
Item
Cost Sharing: Limit on the
proportion of individual project
costs that the Bank may finance.

Parameter
Up to 100 percent

Recurrent Cost Financing: Any
limits that would apply to the
overall amount of recurrent
expenditures that the Bank may
fmance.

No country-level limit
on recurrent cost
financing.

Local Cost Financing: Are the
requirements for Bank fmancing of
local expenditures met, namely that:
(i) financing requirements for the
countries development program
would exceed the public sector’s
own resources and expected
domestic borrowing; and (ii) the
financing of foreign expenditures
alone would not enable the Bank to
assist in the fmancing of individual
projects.
Taxes and duties: Are there any
taxes and duties that the Bank
would not finance?

Yes

Yes

Remarks
Individual projects may be financed
up to 100 percent. The level of Bark
financing will be considered on a
case by case basis. In the aggregate,
it is expected that current financing
patterns would broadly continue with significant financing by the
Government and other donors, and
Bank fmancing continuing at the
current level of about 55 percent of
project costs.
In determining Bank financing of
recurrent costs in individual projects,
the Bark would take into account
sustainability issues at the sector and
project levels. Accordingly, where
individual
projects
include
significant recurrent costs, a detailed
assessment will be conducted
addressing the sustainability of
project achievements, the implied
hture budgetary outlays, and the
sustainability of proposed Bankfinanced recurrent costs.
The two criteria are met. The Bank
may fmance local costs as needed in
individual projects.

The Bank may finance all taxes and
duties in Albania. At the projectlevel the Bank would consider
whether taxes and duties constitute
an excessively high share of project
costs. Should taxes or duti4es that
the Bank considers unreasonable be
introduced, the CFP will be updated.

101

The Country Financing Parameters provide for allowing Bank financing of up to 100 percent of project
costs, with the level of Bank financing considered as needed in individual projects. The flexibility to
finance up to 100 percent of project activities is appropriate as the Government of Albania has shown
commitment and ownership of its development program. The Government has established an IPS, linked
to a medium-term budget framework. The Bank’s lending program represents only a modest share of the
country7spublic investment financing. The actual proportion of Bank financing for individual projects
would be calibrated as needed, however, to ensure adherence to the overall CPS lending envelope and
ensure the sustainability of project-funded activities (especially with respect to recurrent costs). Given the
strong likelihood that Albania may be entering a period of significant fiscal pressures during the present
CPS, consideration would be given to raising financing percentages to 100 percent for some ongoing and
new investment operations in order to prevent a delay in implementation (and hence impact) of the
projects.
Moreover, as Albania has graduated from IDA (mid-2008), there has been a decline in the availability of
grant or concessional external development funds from a number of donors and multi- and bi-lateral
agencies besides the Bank. This trend is expected to continue in the coming years implying that the Bank
may need to continue to provide substantial financing for local as well as foreign costs as it has already
done in the past. Thus far, the Bank has been financing a significant share of local costs of investment
lending to support Government development program, from 90 percent in social sector to 10 percent for
infrastructure sector. This trend is expected to continue during FY 11-14 CPS period, considered on case
by case basis.
On financing of taxes and duties, the tax regime in Albania is considered moderate and well within the
levels seen in neighboring countries. VAT contributes to over half of the tax revenue, and is levied at 20
percent for companies with more than Lek 8.0 million in annual income, 10 percent for non-profit
organizations and 3-5 percent for small businesses. The income tax rate for individuals and f m s is a flat
10 percent. To a lesser extent, domestic revenue is collected through import duties and excise taxes. As
taxes and duties do not constitute a high share of project costs, the Bank may finance all taxes and duties
associated with its projects.
