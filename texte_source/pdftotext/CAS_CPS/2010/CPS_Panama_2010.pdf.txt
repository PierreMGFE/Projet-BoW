PANAMA - COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FY11-14(CPS)

I.

INTRODUCTION

1.
The Martinelli administration took office in July 2009 with a strong mandate for
change. President Ricardo Martinelli was sworn-in for a five-year term on July 1, 2009, backed
by an unprecedented 60 percent election victory and a majority in the National Assembly (42 of
71 seats). The new administration is the fifth democratically elected administration in Panama
since the ouster of Manuel Noriega in 1989. The Martinelli administration hopes to build on the
strengths and lessons of prior governments by combining administrative experience from both
the private and public sectors to enhance the country’s development prospects.
2.
The Government has committed to addressing key development challenges
including bottlenecks to growth as well as expanding economic opportunities for the poor.
Martinelli’s administration is looking toward leveraging private sector economic development
with public investment to assist with some of the country’s most difficult challenges. Compared
to the prior 5 years, the Government is planning to more than double public investment (to over
US$13 billion), a third of which will be invested in projects to improve Panama’s competitive
advantages (logistics, tourism, and agriculture). Moreover, it has committed to deepening the
impact of the country’s flagship poverty reduction conditional cash transfer program, Red de
Oportunidades, improve the efficiency and effectiveness of all public spending, and is hoping to
make significant inroads to improving security, public transportation, educational opportunities,
health care, and water and sanitation. To ensure fiscal sustainability and improve equity, the
Government has begun implementation of a broad-based tax reform that is expected to net an
additional 2 percent of GDP per year.
3.
In its first six months, the Government has delivered on several of its key goals.
These goals have been referred to as the metas imperdonables “goals to be met with no excuses.”
Advances have included: (i) presentation of its 5-year economic development and tax reform
strategy to the National Assembly, (ii) implementation of its tax reform strategy, (iii) increasing
police salaries and the minimum wage; (iv) implementing a program to deliver US$100 per
month for citizens 70 years or older with no pension, called “100 a los 70”; (v) creating the
Metro Secretariat and a plan for a 14 km Panama City metropolitan subway system; and (vi)
achieving an investment grade sovereign credit rating from the three main international rating
agencies. The Government is also making significant progress on negotiating 16 bilateral tax
information sharing agreements (more than the required 12) and expects to meet OECD
requirements by the end of 2010. Recognizing the challenges of implementing its ambitious
program, the Government is also working to improve its governance and transparency through
results based budgeting, enhanced financial management, and procurement reforms.
4.
Unlike many other governments in the region that face a much more divided
legislature and fractured polity, the Martinelli administration has been able to quickly pass
reforms. While this has permitted the implementation of an ambitious development program
and allowed for significant policy changes to deliver on campaign commitments, it has also
generated some concerns about a lack of broad consultation. In mid-June 2010, the Government
passed a package of legal reforms as a means to facilitate the implementation of its ambitious

1

development plan.1 Although the package was presented to promote the speed of public
investment, it has also raised concerns among some civil society groups about limits to labor
rights and the potential easing of environmental regulations. In response, the Martinelli
administration has committed to opening a broad National Dialogue about the new legislation to
provide the opportunity to amend it. The challenge for the Government will be to balance its
commitment to deliver its ambitious development program with the need to develop a broad
consensus in the country on the legal changes required to meet those commitments in a timely
manner.
5.
This Panama CPS (FY2011-14) is built around three pillars aimed to support
Panama in confronting its development challenges: 1) Economic growth that builds on
Panama’s competitive advantages, 2) Providing greater opportunities for all, and 3) Transparent
and efficient public sector that provides returns to society. The third pillar is cross-cutting and
helps support growth and provide for a more efficient and effective public sector. The World
Bank Group (WBG) support within each of these pillars is focused on areas in which the WBG
has a strong comparative advantage by virtue of prior successful programs in Panama or relevant
regional and global experience. The demand-driven partnership program included in the CPS is
intended to be flexible and responsive to changing client needs.
II.

COUNTRY CONTEXT



A.

ECONOMY AND GROWTH

6.
Panama is an upper-middle income country with a dollarized economy and a per
capita gross national income of US$6,740. The country has about 3.5 million people; nearly
three-quarters of them live in urban areas, mostly around the Panama Canal. About 10 percent of
the population is of indigenous origin and primarily reside in remote rural areas.
7.
Panama has an open economy traditionally centered on the Canal, trade and
financial services. Panama is one of the most open economies in the region, with both exports
and imports as a share of GDP above 60 percent. Wholesale and retail trade and financial
services are concentrated in urban areas and have accounted for 40 percent of GDP and over 80
percent of the country’s total exports. Panama’s international service sector rests on five main
activities including the Panama Canal operations, ports and logistics, tourism, re-exports of the
Colon Free Zone, and financial intermediation. Most industry production is agro-industrial and
has traditionally been concentrated in special economic zones that enjoy privileged tax treatment
on inputs for export.
8.
Panama’s growth performance has been comparatively strong. Over the last 50
years, Panama’s real GDP growth has averaged about 5 percent, which has ranked it among the
faster growing economies in Latin America. With an ethnically diverse population, a world
famous canal, and a modern financial and trade sector, Panama has been a prime benefactor of
the increasingly globalized world economy. In the four years prior to the global economic crisis
in 2008, Panama saw growth averaging 8.5 percent per year and the unemployment rate falling
from 13.8 percent to 5.6 percent. Growth was fueled not only by the buoyant global economy,
but also by strengthened domestic policies that improved fiscal balances, reduced financial sector

vulnerabilities, and enhanced productive investment. In addition, through a historic national
referendum in 2006, Panama approved a US$5.25 billion expansion of its canal (See Box 1).
These factors contributed to strengthened investor confidence, lower interest rates, and greater
stability, which allowed the economy to weather the global crisis better than most countries.

Box 1: Panama Canal
Under Panamanian management, both operational and financial performance of the Canal
significantly improved. On December 31, 1999, the control of the Canal was transferred to Panama and
since then the Canal has been managed and operated by the Panama Canal Authority (“ACP”) an
autonomous entity of the national Government. Over 14,700 vessels passed through the Canal every
year, carrying over 300 million tons or 5 percent or the world seaborne cargo trade. The main users of
the Canal are US, China, EU, and Japan, but it is also important to Central and South American
economies.
The Canal is the greatest economic asset of the Panamanian nation. ACP’s transfers to the National
Treasury in 2009 represented about 3.4 percent of country’s GDP and about 12.5 percent of its fiscal
revenues.
The capacity of the original Canal, with all improvements, is currently close to its maximum. To
address the capacity challenge the ACP has developed a US$5.25 billion expansion program that by its
completion in 2014 would double the Canal capacity and enable the use of much larger and more
efficient vessels.
Preliminary estimates suggest a permanent 0.6 to 0.8 percentage-point boost to real GDP growth
after expansion. The improvements would also stimulate international trade and reduce global
transportation costs.
The IFC Board approved a US$300 million loan for the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) in late
2008 as part of the US$5.25 billion financing package for the canal’s expansion. IFC’s participation
ensured the successful structuring of this complex transaction. At the moment, the expansion project is
continuing on schedule.

B.

POVERTY

9.
A key development challenge facing Panama is to ensure that economic growth is
maintained and that benefits are broadly shared. Indeed, Panama’s economic development
has been characterized by a high degree of inequality. Growth has traditionally benefited mainly
the capital-intensive service sectors concentrated geographically in the Panama and Colon
provinces, while generating little economic opportunity for low-income members of society.2
Moreover, while Panama does spend a relatively large share of GDP on social programs
compared to other countries in the region, the effectiveness of these programs in reducing
poverty by creating opportunities for all remains a challenge.
10.
A large share of the population continues to live in poverty, including about 15
percent in extreme poverty (See Table 1). Poverty in the country is concentrated in rural and
indigenous areas. Nearly all people living in indigenous areas are poor (96.3 percent) and most

There are likely many elements behind growth not translating into poverty reduction in the poor and rural areas,
including the lack of education and physical capital, the tradition of communal property, and other cultural and
economic factors.

are extremely poor (85 percent). Indigenous areas have close to 21 percent of the total poor
population and close to 42 percent of the extreme poor. In non-indigenous rural areas, half of the
population is poor. The country has thus one of the highest indexes of inequality in the region
and the world (0.47 Gini coefficient), with the richest 20 percent of the population responsible
for half of the country’s total consumption.

11.
While social outcomes and access to services have improved, there is a need for
greater efficiency and effectiveness in public investment to create greater opportunities for
all. Life expectancy has increased significantly over the years; however, malnutrition remains a
major challenge, particularly in indigenous areas where 62 percent of children under five are
chronically malnourished; in contrast to 11 percent in urban areas. Malnutrition rates in
indigenous areas have increased since 2003, when 57 percent of children were chronically
malnourished. Average years of schooling among adults have increased significantly; yet, there
are major socioeconomic and ethnic differences in school enrollment, especially in secondary
education. For example, while in the urban province of Colón secondary net enrollment rate was
70 percent in 2007, in the Ngäbe Buglé and Kuna Yala indigenous areas it was only about 30
percent.3 In terms of the quality of basic education, there are also significant challenges to
overcome. In a recent regional student learning assessment (SERCE), Panamanian primary
school students in third and sixth grade scored well below the average among the 16
participating countries, ahead only of Dominican Republic and Guatemala.4 Access to water
and sanitation services has improved (the Government estimates that 84 percent of the total
population has access to potable water through connections) but it is much less in rural areas.5
12.
To address these challenges, Panama has introduced various programs to reduce
poverty and increase access to services. The Red de Oportunidades conditional cash transfer
program, for instance, targets the poorest households with children to improve standards of
living and access to basic social services. This program transfers resources to the poorest
mothers so that their children can go to school and receive basic health and nutrition services.
This program benefits mainly people living in indigenous and poor rural areas. The Government
has also strengthened programs that offer health and education services to the poor in rural areas.

13.
The Martinelli administration is committed to deepening the impact of these
programs and generating opportunities for all. The administration has expressed support to
these social programs as well as providing the public investment needed for greater employment
and human development opportunities outside the traditional urban areas. The administration
has also committed additional resources to social protection programs, such as “100 a los 70”
that provides US$100 for retirees 70 years or older not covered by pension programs.
C.

GENDER

14.
Panama is making steady progress on gender equality as measured by education,
health, and labor force participation indicators disaggregated by sex.6 Progress toward
gender equality from a legal and institutional standpoint has also been significant. In terms of
human capital accumulation, women have surpassed men in both secondary and tertiary
education achievements. This trend is common in Central America (with the exception of
Guatemala and El Salvador), but it is especially strong in Panama. Younger generations of
women are now more likely than their male counterparts to complete secondary school.
15.
While women’s wages still fall behind men’s in Panama, the overall wage gap has
narrowed for younger generations. Women still earn between fifty to sixty percent of men’s
wages, which is below Latin America’s average of 67 percent in 1994. This gap is a result not
solely of differences in gender endowments (including education), but of also how these
endowments are rewarded, a pattern which has in part crowded women out of the formal sector
(See Annex E1). The Martinelli administration has expressed its concern and commitment for
narrowing these gaps by enhancing formal sector job market training for underserved segments
of the population. The National Institute of Women (Instituto Nacional de la Mujer, INAMU),
which was created and approved by Law 71 on December 23, 2008 is an autonomous entity that
supports gender equity. The Martinelli administration is providing ongoing support to the
Institute through the First Lady’s Office and the Ministry of Social Development. The World
Bank Group partnership with Panama aims also at decreasing these gender gaps. Two Bank
financed projects support maternal and reproductive health services; another project supports the
CCT program which transfer resources to mothers to improve their families’ living standards.
Finally, the Bank will also provide technical assistance to enhance the formal sector job market
training for underserved segments of the population.
D.

GOVERNANCE AND TRANSPARENCY

16.
President Ricardo Martinelli won the election on a campaign focused on change and
better governance and transparency. Prior to elections in 2009, “inefficient government
bureaucracy” and “corruption” were the top two cited “problematic factors” for doing business in
Panama.7 To improve the situation, the Government Strategic Plan includes a cross-cutting axis
aiming precisely at improving the efficiency of the public sector as well as governance and
transparency.
17.
The Government of Panama has demonstrated its willingness and commitment to
improve transparency and governance by supporting a stronger legal framework. The
approval of the Fiscal Responsibility Law (Law no. 22, 2008), coupled with improvements made
to the Procurement Law (Law no. 22, 2006), and the Law of Access to Information and Habeas


Data (Law no. 16, 2002), which encompasses information held by the state that is specific to an
individual citizen, provide a sound legal framework for future governance and transparency
work, and help improve public perception and trust in the Government.
18.
Efforts led by the Dirección General de Contrataciones Públicas (DGCP) have also
led to improving transparency and governance. For instance, the DGCP, with World Bank
support, created PanamaCompra, an e-procurement platform that reduces payment times to
suppliers of goods and services, and PanamaTramita and PanamaEmprende that simplify
business processes. The Government of Panama has strengthened the public procurement
system not only by increasing its transparency through the use of PanamaCompra but also by
significantly increasing its efficiency through the introduction of framework agreements for
commonly used goods.
19.
Although much progress has been made to improve budgetary management in
recent years, gaps remain and the administration is working to increase effectiveness in
budget preparation and efficiency in budget execution. Panama’s financial management and
budgetary systems are fairly comprehensive and transparent, and the medium term budget
formulation reflects the country’s main priorities. Budget monitoring and execution is timely and
transparent and extensive financial performance information is made public. However, the
Government recognizes the need to strengthen a number of key initiatives that include: (i)
development of a “bottom-up” budgeting process incorporating sector strategic business plans;
and (ii) compliance with public investment programming procedures during budget preparation.
With respect to budget execution, the Government would like to strengthen its capacity to
properly follow procurement plans and control within-year budget modifications to assure
predictability of expenditures.
20.
The country’s public financial management and public procurement systems are
adequate for ongoing and expected future operations. The Bank prepared a CFAA/CPAR in
December 2006 to document the current state of public financial management in the country,
including recommendations to enhance the public expenditure efficiency and strengthen the
impact of the public expenditure. The Government advanced on some of these recommendations.
While challenges remain, the Government is moving ahead to further strengthen its public
fiduciary control framework. Public financial management processes have been supported by the
Bank through previous development policy lending operations as well as an ongoing technical
assistance operation. The Bank is also engaged in policy dialogue with the Government to
follow up on priorities identified in the CFAA/CPAR.
21.
To build on progress made, the Government is working to further strengthen
accountability and utilize performance metrics. The allocation of public resources and the
efficiency of public institutions can be improved by linking public spending to outcomes and
strengthening key functions, such as sector planning and budgeting, as well as the targeting and
allocation of public resources. A critical gap that the administration is working to narrow is the
lack of systematic monitoring and evaluation of programs and projects. The consolidation of a
comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system is recognized as a vital step to achieving
increased effectiveness, impact, and transparency of public spending.

E.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK

22.
Despite the global crisis, Panama has continued to see growth, albeit modest.
Compared to a regional average output contraction of 2.5 percent in 2009, Panama did relatively
well with growth of about 2.4 percent in 2009 (See Figure 1). The direct effects from the global
crisis were modest and the financial system remained stable. However, the economy was
indirectly affected through declines in credit growth, reduced trade financing, and a halt in new
real estate construction, which, in turn, was felt in sectors such as agriculture, transport, trade and
construction. Reflecting the decline in demand, the current account was balanced in 2009, from
a deficit of 11.6 percent in 2008. Going forward, growth is expected to accelerate to over 6
percent and the current account deficit is expected to widen to about 8.0 percent of GDP in 20102011 as internal demand picks up and imports associated with the canal expansion increase.
During 2010 and beyond, economic activity is expected to accelerate. The
Panamanian economy is expected to see 4.8 percent growth in 2010 (See Table 2). The thrust of
the modest acceleration in growth should be based on ongoing high domestic investment rather
than a return to booming external demand. The key elements stoking the domestic economy are
likely to come from the ongoing investment in the Panama Canal expansion project (which by
mid-2010 should begin its more intensive phase. See Box 1) and the implementation of the
Government’s overall investment plan, including initiation of the project to build the Metro.
Stronger credit growth and firmer commodity prices should also contribute to a recovery in
agriculture and industrial output in 2010-11, with efforts to boost infrastructure improving
construction output. Unemployment is expected to fall in 2010 as construction picks up and
financing constraints ease. Based on increased investment and a return to ongoing recovery in
the global economy, annual growth is projected to rise to above 6 percent in 2011-12.
23.



24.
The Government’s investment plan for the 2010-2014 period amounts to US$13.6
billion, which is significantly higher than during prior administrations. About US$7.3
billion will be invested in the social sectors, of which US$2.9 billion will be invested towards
training and social assistance. Most of the investment will be done in the regions outside Panama
City (about US$4.2 billion) but the single most important investment project will be the metro
for the City of Panama (about US$1.8 billion). Other expected investments outside urban areas
include irrigation projects, roads to enhance logistical advantages and interconnection with ports,
and rural electrification. The investment program represents an increase of about 1 percent of
GDP in capital expenditures per year.
25.
Tax reform approved by the National Assembly is expected to increase tax
collections. The first of the two phases of the tax reform was implemented before the end of
2009 and included an increase in taxes for casinos and taxes on income of companies operating
in the Colon Free Trade Zone. The total increase in tax collection for the Central Government
for this phase is estimated at 1 percent of GDP per year. The second phase of the reform was
approved by the National Assembly on March 15, 2010 and includes higher taxes on
consumption and lower taxes on personal and corporate income (See Box 2 for more details).
The Government is expected to collect an additional 1 percent of GDP per year from this most
recent reform. Both the first and second phases of reform will bring about 2 percent of GDP in
additional revenues, which will be sufficient to finance the additional capital expenditures
required by the new investment plan. The tax reform was planned to be neutral in terms of equity
but the VAT increase may have a very modest impact on the poor. The Bank will work with the
Government to improve the targeting of social expending in order to compensate for this
measure.

A combination of a gradual rise in revenue and a containment of current
expenditure should allow the authorities to expand public investment while keeping public
debt sustainable in coming years (See Debt Sustainability Analysis in Annex D1).8 The fiscal
adjustment since 2005 and higher GDP growth resulted in a fall of the consolidated public debtto-GDP ratio from 62.2 percent in 2004 to 38.8 percent in 2008. But in 2009 the debt stock
increased to about 39.4 percent of GDP owing to slower growth and lower revenues. The
Government expects to maintain the deficit within the bounds of the Fiscal Sustainability Law,
which implies a deficit of less than 2.0 percent of GDP in 2010 and a stock of the public debt
stock that rises slightly to around 40 percent of GDP over the next three years and thereafter
begins to decline, which is fiscally sustainable. In particular, the increase in investment will be
financed by the additional revenues collected by the new tax reform, while at the same time
current expenditures are contained.

Box2: Tax Reform
Key changes to the corporate income tax:
x Rates would fall from 30 to 27.5 percent in 2010, and to 25 percent in subsequent years.
x The CAIR (the alternative corporate tax of 1.4 percent of a firm’s turnover) will not be eliminated
but will be levied on firms with gross incomes above US$1 million per year.
x Utilities, casinos, banking, insurance, cement and mining will continue to be taxed at 30 percent.
x The collection of the corporate income tax proceeds will now be made monthly (instead of yearly),
at 1 percent of gross revenues, and excess payments at the end of the year could be credited
towards the following year.
x Telecommunications and airlines will pay taxes on global income.
x Remittances to non-residents (currently taxed at 15 percent) could be exempted if the foreign
beneficiaries are registered in Panama.
x Banks will pay new taxes ranging from ½ percentage point of their net worth, or a minimum of
US$100,000, to a maximum of US$5 million.
Main changes to the personal income tax:
x Maximum marginal tax rates for individuals will fall from 27 to 15 percent.
x About 17,000 of the lowest-paid workers will be exempt from personal income tax, due to the
increase in the threshold of compliance from US$6,000 to US$11,000.
Primary adjustment to indirect taxes:
x The tax on final sales of goods and services and the tax on CIF imports will rise from 5 to 7
percent.

27.
The financial sector has shown significant stability. The banking system’s role in the
region has expanded in recent years, with nonresidents deposit growth providing the main source
of expansion for nonresident’s credit. Panama is an important offshore financial and business
center, with financial intermediation dominated by the banking sector. Holding companies of the
largest Central American financial groups are domiciled in Panama. During the recent global
economic crisis, the financial sector showed remarkable stability underpinned by high
capitalization and liquidity levels.9 The levels of solvency and liquidity of the banking sector
will allow the financial system to support the economic recovery through a credit expansion, as
economic prospects continue to improve.
28.
Enhancements to the financial sector supervision and legal framework have been
implemented. A new Banking Law reinforcing the legal and supervision framework became
effective in August 2008. These measures, supported by the World Bank, strengthen the powers
to regulate and supervise conglomerates, enhance the process of resolution of troubled
institutions and provide legal protection to supervisors. Auditing standards, criteria for the
valuation of collateral and liquidity regulations were also upgraded. Looking ahead, a regional
approach to dealing with potential stress of financial groups needs to be developed and
consolidated and cross-border supervision needs to be strengthened. Also, it is important to
develop contingency plans to deal with situations of financial distress. There continues to be
scope for improvements in non-bank financial supervision and the institutional framework for


The banking sector is considered stable and resilient but there are always external vulnerabilities due to large
foreign deposits and lending, large shares of foreign banks and the sheer size of banking sector (as percentage of
GDP). Capital adequacy ratio remains at comfortable levels at 11.4 percent, while non-performing loans remain low
at 1.4 percent and are fully provisioned. A regional crisis simulation exercise is scheduled for 2010 in which the
Panamanian banking supervisory authorizes will participate. A regional approach to consolidated supervision would
help to deal with potential stress of financial groups with cross-border holdings.

insurance and securities which could further the regional financial integration process. Access to
finance by SMEs is limited and the demand for rural microfinance services is not being served.
A planned Financial Sector Assessment (FSAP) will provide valuable input for the authorities in
designing their financial sector reform program.
29.
The authorities are moving toward greater tax information sharing with bilateral
agreements. Panama is seeking to negotiate more than the required 12 bilateral double taxation
and information exchange treaties by the end of 2010 to be removed from the OECD’s “greylist” of tax havens. Panama has successfully negotiated 8 tax agreements with France, Italy,
Belgium, the Netherlands, Qatar, Spain, Mexico, and Barbados (the last two have also been
ratified). It is also negotiating with South Korea, Ireland, Portugal, Canada, Chile, Luxemburg,
Czech Republic, and Singapore and has plans to extend to additional countries.
30.
Since March 2010, Panama achieved investment grade status from Fitch, Standard
& Poor’s and Moody’s credit rating agencies. Panama’s credit rating upgrade reflects a
sustained improvement in public finances, underpinned by recent tax reforms, and the economy's
resilience to the global financial crisis and associated recession. By achieving investment grade,
the country hopes to lower the cost of borrowing and increase access to additional financing
from institutions and investors that are restricted to high-grade investments.
31.
Panama is actively pursuing greater trade linkages with global markets. The USPanama Trade Preference Agreement (TPA) was signed on June 28, 2007 and ratified by
Panama's National Assembly a month later, but is still pending approval by the US Congress.
Apart from commercial issues, it incorporates economic, institutional, intellectual property, labor
and environmental policies, among others. Panama also launched negotiations with the EU and
the other Central American countries (Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and
Nicaragua) in June 2007 for an Association Agreement (including free trade) to build on the EUCentral America (CA) Political Dialogue and Co-operation Agreement of 2003. While the active
participation of Panama in the negotiations is to be subject to a formal decision to join the
Economic Integration Process in CA (SIECA), Panama has been an observer in the negotiations.
For Panama to become a SIECA member it will have to undertake constitutional changes that
can go beyond the actual negotiations of the EU-CA Associate Agreement (EU-CA AA).

ENVIRONMENT AND DISASTER MITIGATION

32.
Environmental degradation is a challenge in Panama; it increases vulnerability to
natural disasters and undermines the natural resource base for sustained economic growth.
Although Panama is relatively less vulnerable to hurricanes and other catastrophic events than
other countries in the region, it is frequently affected by floods; and with climate change the
frequency of extreme weather events in the region is expected to rise. Panama faces growing
degradation of its urban environments and its natural resources, such as forests, soil and water.
The Government is taking steps to mitigate these problems, including large investments in
improving water quality of Panama Bay and efforts to implement a series of regulatory and
institutional reforms to strengthen environmental sustainability, but Panama still faces ongoing
environmental challenges, such as: (i) the deterioration of water quality; (ii) a high incidence of
waterborne diseases and respiratory illness linked with indoor and outdoor air pollution,
particularly among the poor; (iii) deforestation and the expansion of the agricultural frontier; (iv)
the loss of biodiversity on land and in coastal areas; and (v) pressures on natural resources from
the extractive industries and real estate construction.
11


33.
The Government is planning a series of investments in large-scale infrastructure to
sustain economic growth, enhance competitiveness, and facilitate the planned expansion of
the tourism sector and further growth of maritime and other commercial services. These
mega-projects include construction of new ports, large tourism projects, infrastructure and
mining projects, oil refineries and hydroelectric power plants, road construction, and expansion
of the Panama Canal. Effective environmental management and strong institutional capacity is a
fundamental component in resolving potential environmental problems that are often associated
with these types of investments. Consequently, the development of effective mechanisms is
critical for setting environmental priorities, adequate environmental information systems, strong
environmental regulation and enforcement systems, and a legal framework to facilitate
community participation in the consultative processes and policy coordination across agencies.
34.
The Government of Panama is making important efforts in the Strategic Plan 20102014 (GPSP) toward mainstreaming environmental protection in the sectoral planning
processes, although recent legal changes may increase uncertainty. The GPSP recognizes
that current efforts to promote sustainable land use have been incomplete, with poor planning,
and without effective enforcement of zoning regulations. It also highlights the need for
protecting the country’s natural resource base as a fundamental ingredient for maintaining the
growth performance of key economic sectors, including the operation of the Panama Canal and
tapping the very high potential of the country’s tourism industry to induce economic growth and
generate employment. Nonetheless, recent changes in the country’s legal framework,
particularly the option to exempt projects with a “social interest” from an environmental impact
study and instead use best practice guidelines, may have caused uncertainty over the
Government’s environmental policy stance. While the Government has committed to
reevaluating the recent legal changes through a National Dialogue, and amending them if
needed, it has stated its strong commitment to utilizing global best practices and guidelines in
addressing and mitigating potential environmental impacts. Moreover, for all its projects
financed by the World Bank, the Government has reiterated its commitment to follow all the
operational and safeguard policies required of the World Bank supported projects.
35.
In terms of disaster risk management, the Government acknowledges that there is a
need to strengthen institutions and policies. Actions to improve disaster risk management
include: (i) strengthening the National Civil Protection System (SINAPROC)’s institutional
capacity; (ii) reducing vulnerability in urban areas; (iii) developing the country’s risk assessment
and monitoring capacity; (iv) developing risk reduction strategies for emergency response and
diversified risk management instruments; and (v) strengthening environmental institutions.
36.
Another strategic area high on the Government’s agenda is the response to the
challenges posed by climate change and tapping into the opportunities that it offers. The
GoP recognizes the need to devise an effective climate change mitigation and adaptation strategy
with buy-in from the country’s diverse groups of stakeholders and sectors; a strategy to facilitate
the adoption of innovative technologies in the energy sector and agriculture, encourage private
sector investment in clean technology, promote the use of renewable energy, sustainable land use
and reduced deforestation. On the adaptation side, priority areas are the reduction of
vulnerability to natural resource and climate shocks and the spread of vector-borne diseases. On
the mitigation side, key opportunities include facilitating the use of low-carbon technologies with
cooperation from other countries, such as Brazil or Mexico, that have pioneering experiences in
this area. The GoP is looking to identify opportunities to tap into global climate change finance,
12


e.g. the emerging and growing markets for carbon offsets and REDD credits, and the
opportunities to address other environmental concerns by tapping into instruments such as the
Climate Investment Fund and other innovative means.
III.

GOVERNMENT STRATEGIC PLAN 2010-2014

37.
The Government presented its Strategic Plan to the National Assembly in December
2009. Adhering to the new Social Fiscal Responsibility Law of 2008, the Government provided
details of its plan for growth and social development within its first six months in office. This is
the first time a government has detailed a plan that includes a description of key challenges,
priority programs, and the fiscal and investment plan to ensure that the strategy is implemented
and achieves its goals within the resource envelope available to the country. This plan is
composed of an economic growth strategy, a social strategy, and a cross-cutting axis of
improving governance and transparency.
38.
The first component of the Government Plan, the economic growth strategy, aims to
develop tourism, logistics, and the agri-business industry. These sectors are considered to
have a competitive advantage compared to other sectors and their expansion through additional
public investment, within the context of careful environmental management, would produce a
clear economic and social return. The sectors were also selected as a means to promote
opportunities in less developed parts of the country, to reduce inequalities, and to generate self
reinforcing clusters of growth. This growth strategy mainly supports areas outside the traditional
growth engines of Panama and Colon province and looks to invest in those areas of the country
that have a high economic potential that has yet to be realized. By doing so, the strategy aims to
reduce the dual structure of the Panamanian economy to ensure that all benefit from economic
opportunities.
39.
As a means to kick start development in those areas with high growth potential, the
economic growth strategy establishes an ambitious investment plan to overcome critical
bottlenecks in infrastructure and institutions (such as poor access to roads, policy and
regulatory disincentives). To develop logistical advantages, the Government strategy proposes
building connecting infrastructure and streamlining and modernizing processes. As a means to
facilitate the growth of the tourism industry, the Government aims to generate needed
infrastructure, expand land titling, attract anchor tenants, and launch a marketing campaign based
on a country brand. To develop agriculture, the Government strategy aims to build production
and access roads, expand irrigation, develop cold chain and storage facilities, restructuring
incentives and assistance policy, and creating an institution to promote exports (PanExport). As
a way to maintain the country’s comparative advantage in the financial services industry, the
strategy aims to improve the policy and regulatory environment to improve transparency and
manage financial sector risk.10
40.
The second component of the Government Plan, the social strategy, has two parts,
generation of human capital and social inclusion. This strategy aims at reducing the stark
inequalities that exist in Panama by investing heavily in human capital so that all Panamanians
may benefit from economic opportunities. In addition, the social strategy aims to strengthen the


The World Bank and IMF will assist Panama with these efforts though analytical support under the Financial
Sector Assessment Program (FSAP).



country’s social protection programs to protect vulnerable groups, including additional support to
elderly retirees without pensions.
41.
The first part of social strategy (generating human capital) aims to improve the
quality of education by giving equal opportunities to all and strengthening training to
generate the skills needed in the country’s priority sectors. This component includes the
following strategies: (i) making pre-school education universal; (ii) improving access to basic
education through distribution of scholarships and increasing the supply of middle schools; (iii)
developing “Effective or Quality Schools”; (iv) transforming and modernizing curricula; and (v)
monitoring and evaluating these strategies. Strengthening training is expected to be achieved
through: (i) generating coordination mechanisms between INADEH, the training institute, and
the Ministry of Labor (MITRADEL); (ii) strengthening the institutional capacity of both
agencies to generate a system to effectively identify demand for training and employment; and
(iii) generating mechanisms to consult and address the demands of the productive sector.
42.
To ensure that economic growth generates opportunities for all, the social strategy
also has a comprehensive social inclusion program. This component is composed of seven
activities aimed at: (i) eradicating malnutrition; (ii) extending coverage of potable water to 90
percent of the population; (iii) increasing the coverage and quality of health services with a focus
on basic health care; (iv) increasing access to suitable housing; (v) generating a safe an efficient
public transportation system in Panama city through the construction of the first subway line; (vi)
ensuring public safety; and (vii) strengthening social protection to vulnerable people through
conditional cash transfers and support to the elderly.
43.
The Government’s strategic plan includes a cross-cutting axis designed to improve
the governance and transparency of the public sector. This cross-cutting strategy aims to
improve the efficiency, distribution, and targeting of social spending; and to strengthen
institutional capacities to improve planning and management, including strengthening the
financial management system and continuing the public procurement reform. Government efforts
to reform the national procurement system will focus on: i) linking procurement and budget
planning; ii) improving the legal framework for public procurement; iii) strengthening
monitoring and evaluation systems; and iv) developing the capacity of Government procurement
officials to handle complex transactions and take advantage of savings strategies such as the use
of framework contracts.
44.
To date, the Government has been able to quickly pass reforms to implement its
program, but this speed may slow to provide more time for broader consultations. The
administration’s strong mandate and majority in the National Assembly has permitted the
implementation of an ambitious development program and allowed for the passage of significant
policy changes to deliver on campaign commitments, but it has also generated some concerns
about a lack of broad consultation. Indeed, legal reforms in mid-June 2010 were passed to
promote the speed of public investment, but they also raised concerns among some civil society
groups about limits to labor rights and the potential easing of environmental regulations.11 In
response, the Martinelli administration has committed to opening a broad National Dialogue
about the new legislation to provide the opportunity to amend it. The Government is attempting
to balance its commitment to deliver its ambitious development program with the need to
develop a broad consensus on important legal changes to meet those program commitments in a
timely manner.

IV.
A.

WORLD BANK GROUP-PANAMA PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY

LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE LAST CPS (FY08-FY10) AND ISN (FY06-07)

45.
After close to half a decade of limited presence, the CPS (FY08-FY10) and ISN
(FY06-07) represented a successful re-engagement of dialogue between Panama and the
World Bank and built a solid foundation for future development partnership. The ISN was
discussed with the Board for FY06-07 and represented an important first step toward a full
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). After the successful implementation of the ISN, the World
Bank discussed a three-year CPS for FY08-FY10 that covered the remainder of the Torrijos
administration and the first year of the new Martinelli administration. The strategy to begin with
an ISN and to emphasize AAA early-on contributed to a solid design of the CPS and individual
operations—particularly with respect to development policy lending. The ISN helped the
alignment of the CPS with Government strategy in areas of high ownership and where the major
Government initiatives had been launched.12 The following lessons are relevant to the design
and implementation of next CPS.
46.
Alignment with the political cycle can improve delivery of a CPS. Alignment with
the political cycle facilitates managing shifts in development priorities across governments,
helping to deepen ownership of projects in the portfolio. This strategy can be even more effective
if it is complemented with an up-front delivery of new operations so that their implementation
can take-off early-on, especially given the lags between approval and full implementation. At the
same time, the continuity of initiatives launched under the program can be enhanced by the
dissemination of results and continuous dialogue with a broad base of country stakeholders to
solidify a consensus on development strategy.
47.
Strategic use of synergies across different components of the program can help
improve the effectiveness of Bank support, especially when the relative financial
contribution of the program is small. The CPS succeeded in strengthening the delivery of
results by building synergies across various components of the program. For instance, the AAA
provided solid background for the dialogue and design of operations approved during the CPS
period. The technical assistance operations (public sector and social assistance) contributed to
the design and measurement of the main program initiatives (CCT, procurement, etc.). The CCT
institutional set-up helped improve the targeting of other social assistance programs. The
effectiveness of the DPL profited from the quality and coverage of the AAA and the designs
under the technical assistance. The impact of the next CPS will be enhanced by continued
emphasis on assuring complementary across programs during design and implementation.
48.
Enhanced supervision improved portfolio performance and lessened the effect of
weak implementation capacity. During the CPS period portfolio implementation was affected
by the re-engagement process (youth of the portfolio, setting up implementation systems, etc.)
and the political transition. Intensive supervision helped to identify and address bottlenecks,
including those related to procurement procedures. In addition, close dialogue with the MEF
reduced the number of unexpected budget re-allocations and allowed for changes in project plans
to minimize adverse development impact. In most cases, Government staff and consultants
working directly on the implementation of Bank-financed projects were retained until the end of

The CPS was composed of the following pillars: (i) reducing poverty and inequality; (ii) promoting economic
growth; (iii) strengthening public financial management; and (iv) investing in human capital.

2009 and then in several cases replaced. The two operations, the Rural Productivity project and
the Water and Sanitation in Low Income Communities project, which underwent the most
significant changes in the staff involved in project implementation had not yet recovered
implementation performance by June 2010.
Despite the effects of the transition on
implementation, the new administration confirmed that the portfolio of Bank –financed projects
is well aligned with the priorities of the new administration.13 The Bank expects that with
continued intensive supervision and capacity building support, the portfolio will return to zero
projects at risk by January 2011 and that the disbursement ratio will rise above 20% in FY11.
As a means to deepen development results, facilitate implementation, and better gauge impact
(both intended and unintended), project teams should strengthen dialogue with project
beneficiaries as well as authorities.
49.
Focus on results design, monitoring and evaluation enhances the development
dialogue and serves to gauge progress on development outcomes and Bank contribution to
results. While in some cases the results proposed under the previous CPS centered on
intermediate indicators, analytical work was available to track impact, such as the LSMS survey
that allowed assessment of the targeting accuracy of the CCT program. However, this may not
always be the case; therefore, it is important to assure the quality and comprehensiveness of the
result framework. As the program with Panama matures, it should be possible to focus CPS
results on development outcomes rather than on outputs. The results framework should
incorporate the major strategic concerns of the CPS, which includes consistency between the
results matrix and the priorities stated in the main text of the CPS document. In addition, it is
important to assure that the results framework is tractable and that it is traced regularly and used
in the dialogue with Government.
50.
In Panama, the World Bank Group can be very effective when it concentrates on
the delivery of a mix of lending, technical assistance, private sector support and knowledge
products. The experience in Panama shows that the Bank’s relevance is amplified when the
delivery of lending operations is supported by knowledge products. In turn, technical operations
must continue to strengthen their focus on the development of high quality designs that
incorporate lessons from experiences in other countries, as has been done in the CCT where
Panama absorbed lessons from other programs and went on to build one of the best targeted
programs in the LAC region. In addition, positive experiences in Panama, such as in public
procurement, enrich the Bank’s knowledge base in assisting other countries. A strong AAA
program has also helped contribute to the design of Development Policy Lending which has
proven to be a useful instrument in Panama in support of key Government priorities.
B.

COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY: FY11-FY14

51.
The objective of the CPS is to support Government and private sector efforts to
improve Panama’s productive capacity and reduce poverty. In a context of rapid economic
growth, Panama’s public infrastructure has lagged behind and is becoming itself a constraint to
future growth. While at one time public sector institutions, financial management, and
procurement systems may have been sufficient to manage a nascent economy, their capacity to
manage, monitor and evaluate public investment and spending need to be strengthened to better
support Panama’s new economy.

One exception was the Quality of Education project, which the Government did not find to be well aligned with
the new education strategy.

16


52.
Strategic objectives and areas of engagement. The proposed CPS aims to provide
Panama with flexible, demand-driven and focused assistance to achieve its development goals.
The shared strategy between Panama and the World Bank Group includes reducing poverty and
inequality by expanding opportunities for the poor, particularly the most vulnerable, via
sustainable and broad-based growth. The proposed CPS will cover approximately four years
(i.e., August 2010 to June 2014) to align the program with Panama’s political cycle.
53.
The proposed CPS takes into account the lessons learned from the prior CPS and
ISN, and will feature a mix of instruments to best support Panamanian development needs.
The strategic principles embedded in the strategy include a focus on the sustainability of the
ongoing program. The new administration will continue work on the core development
initiatives that include: social assistance targeting, modernization of procurement and public
financial management, simplification of regulation, and improved service delivery. In addition,
the proposed non-lending interventions will further enhance sustainability through a strong focus
on timeliness, dissemination of results and continuous dialogue with country stakeholders to
achieve greater impact. In terms of lending, the Bank will deliver fewer, larger operations to
make room for greater non-lending support in the Bank’s administrative budget, particularly in
the outer years of the CPS program (See Annex C1). Improvements in the performance of the
portfolio will need to remain a focus of the Bank’s efforts during the CPS period, as well as a
renewed effort to monitor results and development outcomes. The strategic framework also
takes into account the role of IFC, which will continue its steady increase in support for private
sector development through investments, loans, and advisory services aligned with the
Government’s priorities and programs, as well as activities that promote and strengthen regional
integration. This support will build on the current and potential synergies with the Bank, as
appropriate.
C.

KEY PRIORITIES FOR WORLD BANK GROUP SUPPORT



54.
The CPS will support Panama’s Government Strategic Plan in its two main axis,
economic growth, greater opportunities for all, and a cross-cutting axis of improving the
efficiency and transparency of the public sector. As shown in Table 3 below, the CPS will
support the Government’s economic growth strategy through the first pillar of economic growth
that builds on the country’s competitive advantages. This pillar will support the Government in
enhancing the environment for investment and productivity. The second CPS pillar, generating
opportunities for all, aims at supporting the Government’s social strategy in two areas of
generating human capital and improving social inclusion. Through the proposed new operations
and AAA activities and those in the current ongoing portfolio, the CPS will support Panama in
ensuring broad-based and equitable growth opportunities. Finally, the implementation of
Panama’s Strategic Plan would not be possible without strengthening institutions and public
procurement and financial management system. The last pillar of the CPS, aims precisely at
enhancing public sector transparency and efficiency by supporting the introduction of resultsbased budgeting and supporting the financial management, procurement, and tax reforms.

Economic growth that supports competitive advantages. Under this objective, the CPS
program is focused on results in five broad areas: (i) promoting macroeconomic stability by
matching public investment and spending needs with fiscal resources; (ii) improving access and
quality of urban and rural roads; (iii) improving higher education, innovation systems, and
training for competitiveness; (iv) promoting the productive capacity of the country in
underserved regions; and (v) managing the risk of climate change and natural disasters.
Expected results include the maintenance of fiscal sustainability consistent with the Social Fiscal
Sustainability Law, increased productivity of small scale agricultural producers, as well as
enhanced capacity to manage climate change and responsiveness to natural disasters.
x



Lending:
¾ Programmatic Broad-Based Growth and Efficiency Development Policy Loans.
This series will be an umbrella operation that will support major policy actions
and technical achievements under the three pillars of the CPS (Growth,
Opportunities, and Public Sector Transparency and Efficiency).
¾ Rural Productivity Project and Consolidation of the Atlantic Mesoamerican
Biological Corridor Project: This project is currently active. It aims at (i)
contributing to increased productivity among organized rural small-scale
producers and (ii) conserving globally important biodiversity and important
forest, mountain, coastal and marine ecosystems.
¾ Road Asset Preservation Project: This project is currently under preparation and
aims at improving the condition of secondary roads.
18

¾ Catastrophic Risk Deferred Draw-Down Operation (CAT-DDO). The CAT-DDO
would offer Panama a rapid source of funds in the event of a major natural
disaster, enabling a quick response to address emergency needs. This would be
accompanied by the implementation of comprehensive disaster and climate
change mitigation measures.



x

Analytical and Advisory Activities:
¾ Quick Response/On Demand Analytical Support: This would provide for two
short-term reports per year at the discretion of the Government to support this or
the other CPS pillars.
¾ Higher Education and Innovation for Global Competition. This will provide an
analytical support for improving national systems of innovation, and higher
education covering the following issues: (i) the implications for Panama’s higher
education and innovation system resulting from increasing regional integration
and globalization, and the associated mobility of labor or capital; (ii)
benchmarking the higher education system in terms of its contribution to skill
development and knowledge adaptation and innovation against comparator
countries and/or OECD countries; (iii) assessment of the objectives, role and
level of public funding, provision and regulation; (iv) analysis of the needs for
quality assurance and accreditation to increase access through the private sector;
and (v) assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the innovation system.
¾ Non-Lending Technical Assistance (TA) to Improve the Regulatory Framework
and Financing of Technical and Vocational Training Programs. This would be a
TA to improve the activities of INADEH and MITRADEL. This task would
support: (i) the design of a financing mechanism for training to ensure long-term
sustainability. The effort would be to promote partnerships and cost-sharing with
industry and re-assess the function of the Training Fund; (ii) the strengthening of
coordination mechanisms between INADEH and MITRADEL; and (iii) the
design of an information system that monitors training outcomes and evaluates
impacts on a continuous basis.

x

IFC’s Activities:
¾ IFC’s activities in the country focus on supporting further development of
Panama’s financial markets and infrastructure, and on investments oriented to
low-income groups. The Corporation expects to selectively increase its
investments in sectors where Panama has a competitive advantage, and to support
the Government’s reform agenda and mid-term strategic plan. Given the growing
importance of Panama to regional economic integration, the Corporation is
looking at investment opportunities that increase regional competitiveness,
efficiency, and connectivity. At the end of FY2010, the Corporation had US$478
million in total commitments in the country, with US$114 million in investments
outstanding.
¾ IFC is aiming to increase its engagement outside the financial sector. The
Corporation expects to increase support for non-financial sector projects that
advance Panama’s competitiveness and regional economic integration. The focus
of IFC's activity will be on: (i) logistics and infrastructure projects, both private
and PPPs, building on opportunities offered by Panama’s growth as a regional
transportation hub, (ii) support the development of export-oriented agribusiness
and food producers, particularly by addressing cold storage chains and high value19

added agricultural products, and (iii) continue to support investments that increase
the share of alternative energy, renewable sources, and climate change-related
projects in the region’s energy matrix. This would build on IFC’s recent
commitment of its first investment to develop two small/medium size hydro
power projects with a combined 85 MW generating capacity. IFC also aims to
support corporate clients pursuing either a regional consolidation strategy or are
expanding their reach to lower-income groups, as in the case of low income
housing.
¾ Subnational finance represents IFC's largest exposure in Panama, with US$300
million outstanding at the close of FY 2010, equivalent to 70 percent of the
committed balance. This commitment consists of a single transaction to support
the Panama Canal expansion project. IFC has committed a further US$50 million
to telecom and US$47 million to infrastructure projects.
¾ IFC’s activities in the financial services industry will continue to be focused on
strengthening Panama's leading position in the region. In the financial sector,
IFC's focus is to: (i) support those institutions with a pan-regional presence in
neighboring Central American and Andean markets; (ii) support financial
institutions that focus on local SMEs and provide banking services for
underserved low-income groups; and (iii) support the development of Panama as
a hub for the region’s insurance and re-insurance industry. Financial services
represent IFC's second largest exposure in Panama, with US$80 million in
commitments to financial institutions, or 17 percent of its committed portfolio in
FY 2010.
56.
Greater Opportunities for all. The CPS program will contribute to this objective in three
ways: (i) improve access to and quality of basic health and nutrition services, with a focus on
reproductive and child services benefiting rural and indigenous populations; (ii) strengthen social
protection programs; and (iii) improve quality and access to rural and urban water and sanitation
services. Primary expected results include, among others, increased access to health services,
particularly prenatal services for women and vaccinations for children, increased access to water
and sanitation services for rural and peri-urban areas, and improved effectiveness and targeting
of social protection programs.
x



Lending:
¾ Strengthening the Network of Basic Health and Nutrition Services. This operation
would support the Social Strategy of the Government Strategic Plan through
strengthening the provision of basic reproductive and child health and nutrition
services. This operation would finance: (i) Support for the functioning of
Innovative Primary Health Care Centers known as MINSA-CAPSI, one of the
President’s “Imperdonables” projects; (ii) The continued support to MINSA’s
Health Extension Coverage Strategy in rural areas through a results based
financing scheme; (iii) The strengthening of MINSA’s institutional capacity to
exercise its stewardship role in the health sector; and (iv) improvement in
procurement and delivery of pharmaceuticals.
¾ Strengthening Panama’s Social Protection System Technical Assistance Loan.
This operation would support the second axis of the GOP’s Social Strategy, the
social inclusion axis, by improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the social
protection system. This operation will support two main activities: (i) improving
the efficiency and targeting of social programs; and (ii) providing support to the

Government’s flagship program “100 a los 70”, which is a non-contributory
pension, offering a subsidy of US$ 100 a month to people above 70 years of age
who are living under poverty and who do not receive any other transfer.
Health Equity and Performance Improvement Project: This project is currently
active. This operation main objective is to increase access of populations in
selected underserved rural communities to quality basic health services known to
improve maternal, reproductive, and child health; and to improve health system
performance. This operation benefits rural communities where an important share
of indigenous peoples lives.
Social Protection Project - Support to the Red de Oportunidades: Improves the
management and operation of the Conditional Cash Transfer Program (Red de
Oportunidades) to increase demand for education and maternal and child health
services with a focus on indigenous areas.
Water and Sanitation in Low income communities: This project is currently
active. It aims at increasing access to sustainable water supply and sanitation
services in participating communities.
Metro Water and Sanitation Improvement Project: This project was recently
approved by the board. Its objective is to increase the quality, coverage and
efficiency of water supply and sanitation services for lower-income areas in the
Panama Metropolitan Region.

Analytical and Advisory Activities:
¾ Making Progress on Reducing Poverty and Inequality (Poverty Assessment):
This study would be part analytical and part technical assistance utilizing the
findings of the recent LSMS, and sectoral knowledge to build a road map for
implementing structural policies to address hard to reach pockets of poverty,
particularly in rural and indigenous areas.
¾ Quick Response/On Demand Analytical Support.

57.
Enhanced Public Sector Transparency and Efficiency. The CPS would contribute to the
achievement of this objective in four key areas: (i) enhance transparency and efficiency of
public spending and reduce red-tape; (ii) create effective monitoring and evaluation of public
sector programs; (iii) create results-based budgeting processes; (iv) modernize financial
management and procurement systems; and (v) improve collection and efficiency of property
taxes. The key results expected under this pillar include: improved budgeting processes to
ensure accurate budget execution and evaluation of outcomes and outputs, increased savings in
public procured goods and services as measured by the reduction in operational costs, and higher
efficiency in property tax collections.
x



Lending:
¾ Enhanced Public Sector Efficiency Technical Assistance Loan. This loan would
provide ongoing support to the MEF, Sectoral Ministries, DGCP, Oficina de
Metas Presidenciales, and CGR to improve transparency, effectiveness, and
efficiency in the public sector. The loan continues support initiated under the
Public Policy Reform Loan that recently closed on June 30, 2010 and expands
into new areas. This operation would include support for starting the
implementation of performance-informed budgeting, financial management
strengthening, targeting of programs, monitoring and evaluation of public sector
spending, and public procurement reforms. In addition, the loan would support
21

reforms to the administration of property taxes and would contain two
fundamental elements: (i) developing a strategy for property tax administration
reforms and (ii) providing support for implementation of new cadastre system.
x

Analytical and Advisory Activities:
¾ Public Sector Expenditure and Institutions Review: Mapping of functions,
coverage, and efficiency of public sector programs. Currently, there are
numerous programs with overlapping mandates. Besides being costly, this creates
a lack of coordination and responsibility for public sector outcomes. This study
will evaluate optimal organization of the public sector and make recommendation
for reforms. It will also identify structural and overarching institutional hurdles
and bottlenecks that prevent optimal use of public resources and potential options
for moving forward.
¾ Public Credit Advisory Services (fee for service). This fee for service activity is
offered by the World Bank Treasury as a means to support the Government’s
ongoing efforts to build capacity and tools to manage the validation of cost-risk
tradeoffs and preparation of risk reports. This activity could also support the
Government’s plan to strengthen the development of a domestic market for
Government securities.
¾ Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Review: The objective
of this activity is to evaluate the current situation of processes, systems, and
institutions related to Public Financial Management (PFM) in the country and
compared them with international best practices. This review will use the PEFA
methodology based on objective indicators for PFM performance to be able to
assess the condition of country PFM systems and develop a practical sequence of
reforms and capacity-building actions, in a manner that encourages country
ownership; reduces transaction costs; enhances donor harmonization; allows
monitoring of progress of country PFM performance over time; better addresses
developmental and fiduciary concerns; and leads to improved impact of reforms.
¾ Quick Response/On Demand Analytical Support.

WORLD BANK GROUP PROGRAM OF SUPPORT



58.
The ongoing portfolio is highly relevant to country needs and is consistent with the
new Government’s four-year (2010 – 2014) Strategic Plan. The IBRD holds a small portfolio
in Panama, which comprises six lending operations and a GEF grant; totaling US$181.4 million.
Two operations recently closed in May and June 2010: the Land Administration Project
(US$47.9 million) and the Public Policy Technical Assistance (US$15.2 million). The portfolio
includes operations in health, social protection, rural development, and infrastructure (see Table
4). Portfolio performance slowed slightly after the Progress Report, due in part to delays in
implementation attributed to the transitory impact of the change in Government. The current
undisbursed balance is US$156.0 million. With the exception of the GEF, there are currently no
trust funds under implementation in the Bank’s portfolio in Panama.

IFC’s investments have climbed steadily every year since 2006 when the
Corporation made just US$1.1 million in commitments to Panama. IFC’s committed
portfolio as of June 30, 2010 totaled US$477.91 million over nine clients (Table 5). Consistent
with IFC’s regional priorities, infrastructure/sub-national finance accounted for 73 percent of the
portfolio, financial markets for 17 percent, and information and technology for 10 percent.

The list of possible operations is indicative and will continue to feature a mix of DPL
and investment lending. There is greater certainty with respect to the early years where
Government priorities are clearer (see Table 6). The CPS proposes a flexible approach to
programming for the outer years of the CPS, when lending is expected to be at lower levels than
during the early years. Overall lending will depend on Government demand and performance in
the course of the CPS period as well as the IBRD's overall lending capacity and demand by other
borrowers. There are some early indications of possible areas of support, and the Progress
Report will provide an opportunity for adjustments as needed. It is anticipated that the program
areas supported will reflect a certain degree of continuity with the areas supported under the
previous CPS, in line with the lessons learned in the CPS Completion Report.

There will continue to be a strong focus on analytical and advisory services, to be
agreed in partnership with the Government. In line with the lessons learned in the
Completion Report, the Bank will continue to focus on the delivery of a mix of products. A
strong AAA program will be particularly important to inform future Development Policy
Lending and support key Government priorities. Analytical and advisory services will also be
important to lay the foundation for future lending, as well as to support monitoring and
evaluation efforts for key Government programs. The Government has also expressed an interest
in just-in-time policy notes and technical assistance to inform policy discussions and enrich the
quality of the Bank engagement in Panama. Finally the Bank also stands ready to provide policy
and technical advice in the growing Global Public Goods agenda, where the Bank has a
comparative advantage.
E.

RESULTS MONITORING

62.
The Bank will continue to support results-based monitoring, including the
production of reliable and timely statistical data. In line with lessons identified in the CPS
Completion Report, individual operations will be closely monitored and the program will track

the specific milestones and outcomes that the CPS is designed to support over the next four years
(see the CPS Results Matrix Annex B1). In addition, the Bank will also help to strengthen
national monitoring systems and support better coordination in collection and use of data by lineministries. Strong national statistics systems are an essential building block of development
accountability. The Bank will continue to support the Comptroller General and the Ministry of
Economy and Finance under the new Enhanced Public Sector Efficiency Technical Assistance
Loan to improve the content of financial, budgetary and fiscal data in line with international best
practice. Direct support will be provided to the various line-ministries to strengthen their
abilities to collect and use data in coordination with Panama’s National Department of Statistics
and Census through institutional strengthening components in Bank-financed loans.
F.

COUNTRY SYSTEMS AND DONOR HARMONIZATION

63.
Country Systems. As part of the fiduciary environment for project implementation, the
GoP has largely relied on the use of fiduciary agents for project implementation, resulting in
difficulties in obtaining accurate execution data and limitations on the application of budgetary
and external control and procurement regulations. The Martinelli administration wants to
strengthen country systems to progressively move away from fiduciary agents. The Bank has
aligned with this initiative and is supporting the GoP to examine ways to strengthen capacity at
sectoral level, reduce transaction and financial cost, and increase sustainability on the Bank
supported projects. The GoP with World Bank support is currently developing a project
execution budgetary module for SIAFPA, named SIAFPA Proyecto.
64.
Donor Harmonization. The Government has been in close dialogue with main
multilateral partners, such as the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the Andean
Development Corporation (CAF), the European Commission (EC), the UN agencies, and the
World Bank, as well as bilateral agencies like USAID, JICA (Japan), and AECI (Spain) to
discuss financial and technical support. Several new operations will be implemented jointly
and/or coordinated closely with IDB and CAF in this new CPS, including the Metro Water and
Sanitation Improvement Project which will start implementation the first half of FY11. In
addition, the IDB and the WB are jointly supporting the Conditional Cash Transfer Program
(Red de Oportunidades) providing parallel financing using harmonized fiduciary, procurement,
and monitoring and evaluation systems.
65.
As part of the overall initiative to use country systems and the principles set in the
Paris Declaration and in the Accra Agenda for Action, the Bank aims to pursue further
harmonization with other donors to reduce transaction costs. This includes specific
initiatives to adopt a unique financial reporting with IDB under the leadership of the “Dirección
de Contabilidad” of MEF. As the size of the World Bank program in Panama has grown,
coordination and harmonization has become an important focus, especially with USAID, IDB
and CAF to ensure complementariness among the programs. The Directorate of Technical
Cooperation at the Ministry of Economy and Finance is responsible for donor coordination.
Staff from the Directorate of Technical Cooperation regularly engages in work program planning
with Panama’s various development partners on an individual basis, ensuring that Government’s
strategic needs are being met. Donors then coordinate amongst themselves in complementary or
overlapping program areas.

G.

CONSULTATIONS

66.
The proposed activities supported by this CPS have been widely consulted with
country stockholders. Since the 2009 presidential election the Panamanian society continues to
being consulted and shows board support to the policy platform under implementation by the
current administration. This CPS is being developed closely with the Government in
consultation with civil society and will support the Government’s Strategic Plan for the next
years. The proposed activities presented in this document were all requested by the Government,
taking into account the possible resources of the Bank and its competitive advantage.
67.
The consultation process for the proposed CPS program included major
stakeholders and Government authorities. Formal consultation meetings were organized the
week of May 24 in Panama City and included sectoral Government representatives, as well as
representatives of business, the international donor community, think tanks, universities,
indigenous communities, and civil society organizations (See Annex F1). Some informal
consultations took place earlier. These informal consultations included Panamanian authorities
(MEF and Presidency), different sectoral Government representatives (MINSA, IDAAN, MOP,
DGCP, Contraloria, MEF, INADEH, MIDES, Metro Secretariat), members of think tanks (e.g.
INDESA), indigenous groups, and the donor community (CAF, IDB, UNDP, and USAID).
68.
During the formal consultations, participants considered the Bank to be an
important partner in Panama’s development agenda, thus, some issues and priorities were
raised for the Bank to consider in the CPS. These areas included: 1) The importance of
building a program that is participatory and benefits all Panamanians, including indigenous
peoples and small farmers. There is a general concern that the speed of the Government’s
program is not adequately allowing for sufficient dialogue among various stockholders. 2) The
need to strengthen human capital. Participants in various groups highlighted the importance to
enhance the quality of basic education and capacity building to ensure sustainable growth that
will benefit all. Some representatives of indigenous groups mentioned among its priorities the
implementation of bilingual intercultural education for improving educational outcomes. During
consultations the importance of increasing the competitiveness of Panama’s labor force was
discussed, in particular the productivity of small scale-producers by promoting and empowering
them to participate in international markets. 3) Crime and violence was also mentioned as a key
development challenge for the country. Participants were concerned about the increasing levels
of crime and violence, particularly in Panama City and its peri-urban areas, as well as Colon city.
Stakeholders expressed their interest in learning about crime prevention programs that the Bank
has supported and it was noted that that the security issue in Panama must be of critical
importance in the National agenda to ensure the effectiveness of the Government Plan.
69.
The Bank will continue its consultation process with the Panamanian stakeholders
on a regular basis, including in the preparation of specific projects, and will incorporate to the
extent possible recommendations made during the CPS consultations meetings into the design of
specific projects.

RISKS TO PANAMA CPS

70.
Economic: Panama was one of the few countries in the region that experienced
economic growth in 2009, although it was a significant slowdown from prior years. To a large
degree, near-term growth is expected to follow the global economic recovery and surpass many
26


countries in the region as pre-financed investment spending (particularly in the Canal)
accelerates. However, there is a risk that growth may remain lower than expected, particularly if
external demand does not pick up and tax resources available to the Government are constrained.
Less than expected tax collections, due to slower than expected growth and/or less than
anticipated results from tax reforms, could either constrain the Government’s investment
program and/or put pressure on fiscal balances. This, in turn may slow execution of projects.
This risk is mitigated by the steps the Government is taking to ensure adequate fiscal resources
through its already approved tax reform plan as well as steps it its taking to maintain investment
grade credit rating on its sovereign borrowing.
71.
Institutional: The Government has committed to implement its wide-reaching
development strategy before its tenure ends in 2014. The speed of the process may, however, be
more rapid than the ability of current institutional capacity to cope, and hence, implementation
bottlenecks may occur as well as the potential for procurement errors and other costs. These
risks will be mitigated by strengthened supervision of Bank financed projects, but also through
technical assistance support the Bank is providing for financial management processes,
transparency, and procurement processes to the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the General
Accounting Office, and the General Directorate of Public Procurement.
72.
Political: The rapid speed of implementation and wide-reaching nature of the
development plan may also lead to political concerns that there is a lack of transparency and
adequate consultation on development projects. Particularly, historically marginalized groups
such as the indigenous and poor may be given less voice in the development process if
implementation is emphasized over consultation and planning. This, in turn, may solidify and
strengthen political opposition to all projects, regardless of their merit and, hence, slow project
implementation. Indeed, recent changes to the labor and environmental codes led to wide-spread
protests.15 To its merit, the Government has responded by opening a National Dialogue on the
recent changes to the law in order to seek a broader consensus within the country and make any
changes if needed. To mitigate this risk in the context of the CPS strategy, the Bank will work
jointly with authorities to conduct broad consultations within Bank supported projects.
Environmental and Natural Disaster: The Government’s ambitious investment plan,
as well as the proposed operations supporting this plan, could be delayed due to natural disaster
risks, environmental concerns, and uncertainty about environmental policies. As in any large
program of infrastructure development, the scope for unexpected delays due to potential
environmental and natural disaster challenges is a risk for program implementation. This is
particularly the case of Panama with such a large number of projects in the Government’s
strategy. In addition, recent changes to environmental policies and norms may also delay the
implementation of the Government’s strategy as institutions adjust and the potential effects are
evaluated.16 To reduce this risk, the Bank will be working closely with the client to ensure that
all environmental evaluations as well as mitigation strategies are timely implemented during the
early stages of Bank project design. The Bank will also be supporting Panama’s development of
a natural disaster risk mitigation strategy.

Law 30 allows for “good-practice” guidelines to be used in place of environmental impact assessments if a
project was deemed in the “social interest” and, in terms of the labor code, makes it illegal for non-voluntary union
dues and allowed for temporary workers to replace striking union members, among other changes.
16
Law 30 also authorizes the adherence to ‘Good Environmental Practices’ in lieu of an Environmental Impact
Assessment as previously prescribed by Article 23 of Ley 41 of 1998.

Expects to Influence
Milestones

A. Maintain macroeconomic
stability and enhance
Panama’s productive capacity
to expand opportunities for
job growth outside the
traditional urban centers.

Agricultural productivity has
decreased in recent years due to
low investment in infrastructure
and technologies, reflecting low
land tenure security, inadequate
access to credit, inefficiencies in
the agricultural technical
assistance system, and high levels
of protection.

Panama requires large
infrastructure investment to
enhance productive capacity
outside of traditional urban
centers. In order to achieve
ambitious plans in the context of
macroeconomic sustainability, the
country will need to supplement
public funds with enhanced
private domestic and foreign
direct investment. In addition, the
government will need to increase
fiscal revenues and improve
efficiency of the tax collections.

Annex D1: Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
1.
The debt sustainability analysis presented in this annex is based on the macroeconomic
framework summarize in Table 2 of the main document. The analysis uses both a deterministic
model and stochastic simulations. The analysis applies two different concepts of public debt: (1)
Non Financial Public Sector (NFPS) debt, excluding the accounts of the Panama Canal Authority
(ACP); (2) NFPS debt including debts of the ACP.17 Both definitions define debt on a net basis
by excluding public debt instruments held by the Fiduciary Fund and the Institute of Social
Security (CSS) from gross public debt.
2.
The economy is expected to recover from the global crisis to a growth rate of 6.5 percent
in 2012 (up from a 2.4 growth rate in 2009). In the baseline scenario, the fiscal deficit of the
NFPS, excluding the ACP will remain below 1 percent of GDP with the exception of 2010 as
stipulated in the Social and Fiscal Responsibility Law. GDP inflation to remain at 2.5 percent.
3.
Table D1.1 presents the evolution of the stock of the NFPS debt from 2005 to 2009
providing a breakdown by credit for the stock of debt. Panama’s public debt is mainly external
(93 percent of total debt). Domestic debt corresponds to about 7 percent to the total debt.

4.
Panama’s public debt is projected to stay on a sustainable path over the period
2010-2015. Table 3 indicates that a zero primary balance, on average, between 2010 and 2015
would result in a gradual decline in the public debt to GDP ratio from 40.1 percent of GDP by
the end of 2009 to 35.8 percent by end-2015.
5.
Although the debt outlook under the baseline scenario looks fairly stable, there are
still some potential economic risks that could arise in the medium term. To examine the
potential implication of these risks, Table D1.2 present projected debt dynamics for the NonFinancial Public Sector (excluding. ACP) under most pessimistic alternative scenarios:

The Panama Canal Authority is an autonomous agency with fiscal accounts separate from that of the NonFinancial Public Sector. ACP debt is not explicitly guaranteed by the sovereign.

Considering tighter financial market conditions reflected in higher real interest rates for
public debt over 2010-2011- scenario B 1- projected debt indicators for 2011 would be
1.7 percentage points higher than under the baseline scenario.
Under a pessimistic growth scenario (2 percent contraction over 2010-2011) compared to
the baseline (6.1 percent over 2010-2015)-Scenario B2- the public debt-to-GDP ratio
would be 5.3 percentage point higher than under the baseline scenario in 2015.
Assuming a looser fiscal policy-scenario B3- with an average primary deficit of 0.7
percent of GDP over 2010-2011 instead of the assumed primary surplus of 2.1 percent of
GDP under the baseline scenario, the public debt-to-GDP ratio would be 4.1 percentage
points higher than under the baseline scenario in 2015.
Under a scenario of contemporaneous shocks in which GDP growth, the primary balance
and real interest rates are affected- scenario B 4- the public debt-to-GDP would reach
32.1 percent in 2015 or 7.3 percentage points higher than in the baseline scenario.

The second part of the analysis incorporates the accounts of the Panama Canal Authority
and the canal expansion borrowing schedule for the period 2010-2015. The ACP is an
46

autonomous entity which has fiscal accounts separate from the rest of the Panamanian public
sector. Nonetheless, the ACP has close ties to the public sector, and has contributed to the annual
revenues of the NFPS by an average of 3.3 percent of GDP during 2005-2009. Due to the
expansion of the Panama Canal, ACP debt will increase noticeably over the next few years.
7.
The debt sustainability analysis for the NFPS, including the ACP (Table D1.3), indicates
than an average 1 percent of GDP primary surpluses between 2010-2013 would lead the debt-toGDP ratio to gradually decline to 27.8 percent of GDP in 2015. This figure is 3 percentage points
of GDP higher than the NFPS debt excluding the ACP. The most severe test, which assumes a
combined shock on the growth rate, interest rate and primary balance, the public debt-to-GDP
ratio would reach 35.2 percent in 2015. However, it is noteworthy, that the projected debt-toGDP ratio declines under all other stress tests.

Stochastic simulations assign a low probability to a sharp increase in the debt ratio.
Stochastic simulations produce confidence intervals for the public debt ratios corresponding to
varying degrees of uncertainty for four key macroeconomic variables: (a) domestic interest rates,
(b) the growth rate, (c) the exchange rate, and (d) the foreign interest rate. Assuming an average
0.9 percentage point of GDP primary balance including ACP and (2.1 percentage points of GDP
primary surplus excluding ACP) in the period 2010-2015, there is a 97.5 percent probability that
the public debt-to-GDP ratio will remain between 18.6 (15.3) and 37.3 (33) percent by end-2015
(Figure D1.1).

Fiscal Sustainability Framework (FS)

9.
The level of public debt is said to be sustainable whenever it does not exceed the present
value of future primary surpluses. In simple terms, an upward trend in public debt to GNP ratio
is regarded as a signal of unsustainability. The deterministic models of FS are based on some
accounting identities. The first step of the analysis is to produce a baseline scenario projection
for public debt-to-GNP ratio based on some specific macroeconomic and fiscal policy forecasts.
The next step is to conduct stress tests in order to determine the bounds of debt ratio under less
favorable assumptions. A declining trend in debt ratio is deemed favorable for sustainability, but
judgment critically depends on the soundness of the underlying forecasts of the key
macroeconomic variables. Although the analysis is practical and the interpretation of its results
is quite straightforward, the framework has many shortcomings. The main drawback is the
ignorance of the interaction among the variables; a shock to a specific variable is assumed to
have no repercussions on other key variables. This apparently implies that the final impact of a
shock on the debt ratio could be underestimated.
10.
A more recent approach to fiscal sustainability is utilizing a stochastic simulation tool.18
This framework takes the interactions among key variables into account, contrary to the
deterministic approach. The common practice is to estimate a VAR model in order to obtain the
correlation matrix of the key macroeconomic variables that are assumed to have an impact on

debt ratio. The next step is to use these correlations to carry out Monte Carlo simulations with
an aim to generating large sample of bound tests. As a result, frequency distributions of the debt
ratio can be derived for each year of projection, which provides a probabilistic assessment of
debt sustainability. The aim of the analysis is not to determine the path of the public debt ratio
but to produce “fan charts” that display confidence bands for varying degrees of uncertainty
around a median projection. More simply, the analysis produces the probability that the
simulated debt ratio exceeds a certain level.
11.
The following is a brief discussion of the methodology developed by Bandiera et al
19
(2006) . The crucial element of the analysis is to determine the interactions among key
variables that are assumed to have significant impacts on public debt ratio. These key variables
are real interest rate on foreign and domestic debt, real GDP growth rate, and the change in real
exchange rate. The primary step is to estimate an unrestricted VAR model composed of the
above key variables:

The next step is to carry out Monte Carlo simulations in order to generate random
numbers for these four key variables, each of which has a standard normal distribution. Then,

Annex E1: Gender Issues in Panama
1.
Panama is making steady progress on gender equality as stated on the third Millennium
Development Goal and measured by a set of basic education, health, and labor force participation
indicators disaggregated by sex (Panama PA 2007). Progress towards gender equality from a
legal and institutional point of view has also been significant.
2.
In terms of human capital accumulation, women have surpassed men in both secondary
and tertiary education achievements in the country. As indicated in Figure 1, this trend is
common in Central America (with the exception of Guatemala and El Salvador), but it is
especially strong in Panama. Younger generations of women are now more likely than their
male counterparts to complete secondary school.

Despite these educational advances, women’s wages still fall behind men’s in Panama.
As indicated in Figure 2, while the gap has narrowed for younger generations, women still earn
between fifty to sixty percent of men’s wages in the country. This is below Latin America’s
average which in 1994 was 67% of men’s wages. This gap is a result not of differences in
gender endowments (including education), but of how these endowments are rewarded, a pattern
which has in part crowded women out of the formal sector.

In addition to earning less, women are also more vulnerable to macroeconomic shocks in
Panama. As depicted in Figure 3, women’s employment elasticity with respect to GDP in the
region has been consistently above men’s. The current economic crisis may have
disproportionately decreased women’s incomes, especially through employment cuts in exportoriented industries. This likely loss of women’s income may have long-term negative
implications for the welfare of poor households in the region since women are more likely to
invest a larger proportion of their income on their children.

Annex F1: Consultation with Panamanian Stakeholders
1.
Indigenous groups, think tanks, religious organizations, international financial
institutions, private sector and Government representatives were convened in Panama City to
participate in the CPS Consultations on May 24 – 26, 2010.
2.
Discussions with the Panamanian stakeholders were based on a Power Point presentation
the Bank prepared to obtain feedback on the Bank’s proposed programs and possible areas of
intervention, in support of the Government’s five year Development Plan: Plan Estratégico de
Gobierno 2010 – 2014. Participants consider the Bank as an important ally for Panama’s
development agenda, thus, some issues and priorities were raised for the Bank to consider in this
CPS as summarized below.
3.
A Government Development Plan for all. Participants expressed during consultations
their desire of a more inclusive and participatory Social and Economic Development Plan that
benefits all Panamanians, including indigenous peoples and small farmers. Some stakeholders
stated that the Government Investment Plan for the next four years is highly focused in mega
infrastructure projects that will reinforce the dual economy in Panama and will benefit the
traditional sources of growth around the Canal and the Colon Free Zone. Participants in various
groups stressed the need for economic development to accompany social development.
4.
Strengthen Human Capital. Participants in various groups highlighted the importance
to enhance the quality of basic education and capacity building to ensure sustainable growth that
will benefit all. Some representatives of indigenous groups mentioned among its priorities the
implementation of bilingual intercultural education for improving educational outcomes. The
lack of qualified Panamanian manpower is a bottleneck for growth and a loss of opportunity to
take significant labor positions in the country that are generally filled by foreign work force or
foreign-educated Panamanians.
5.
During consultations it was discussed the importance of increasing the competitiveness of
Panama’s labor force in particular the productivity of small scale-producers by promoting and
empowering them to participate in international markets.
6.
Ensuring access to basic health care services is also an essential vehicle for developing
human capital. Stakeholders expressed their concern that Panama has not made significant
progress on health indicators, particularly the indigenous groups in rural areas.
7.
Crime and Violence. Participants were concerned of the increasing levels of crime and
violence, particularly in Panama City and its peri-urban areas, as well as Colon city; and
requested the Bank assistance in crime prevention programs for youth to drift apart from gangs
and consequently reduce the percentage of drop-outs in middle and high schools. Stakeholders
expressed their interest in learning about crime prevention programs that the Bank has supported
in other countries like Honduras and Colombia with the program “Barrio Seguro.” It was
discussed in the CPS consultations that the security issue in Panama must be of critical
importance in the National agenda to ensure the effectiveness of the Government Investment
Plan.
54

8.
Increasing Transparency and Improve Public Sector Efficiency. Participants stressed
the importance of increasing accountability in the public sector to enhance transparency and
efficiency in public financial management and procurement systems, which will allow a better
delivery of social services. The government representatives acknowledge the Bank assistance on
public policy reform and the State modernization and encourage the Bank to continue its support
in reducing bureaucratic red-tape and other regulatory burdens. Stakeholders agree with the
Bank assistance through this CPS in effective monitoring and evaluation of public sector
programs and results-based budgeting process to ensure accurate budget execution and
evaluation of outcomes and outputs.
9.
Harmonization and Coordination in Government co-shared programs. Participants
consider the Plan Estratégico de Gobierno 2010 – 2014 a very ambitious plan and are concerned
of the coordination and harmonization among Government entities to avoid overlapping
responsibilities during the preparation, implementation, and supervision stages of co-shared
projects, like the Metro. Thus, they would like to seek assistance from the Bank to ensure
synergy in co-shared programs among Government entities. In addition, it was stated that the
Government should ensure continuity of its “metas imperdonables”, which are goals to be met
with no excuses reflected in its National Development Plan.
10.
Medium and Long-Term Agenda. Some stakeholders expressed the need to strengthen
the Strategic Development Plan over a long-term vision based on a country vision agreed during
the “Acuerdos de la Concertación Nacional”.20
11.
The Bank will continue its consultation process with the Panamanian stakeholders on a
regular basis, including in the preparation of specific projects, and will incorporate to the extent
possible recommendations made during the CPS consultations meetings into the design of the
CPS.

This forum for National Dialogue for Development (facilitated by the UNDP) between the Government and a
wide range of social organizations, including representatives of indigenous peoples, is aimed at agreeing on a longterm strategy for economic development and poverty eradication. Central to this strategy is prioritizing the use of
additional revenue generated by expansion of the Panama Canal following its expected completion in 2014. See
Annex 5 for details.

Annex G1: Completion Report

Country: Panama
Date of CPS: September 7, 2007
Date of Progress Report: March 16, 2009
Period Covered by CPS: FY2008-FY2010
1.
This Annex presents the Completion Report for Panama’s FY08-FY10 Country
Partnership Strategy. This CPS, as well as the Interim Strategy Note ISN FY06-FY07 (Report
No.32887-PA) that preceded it, supported the Torrijos administration in implementing an
ambitious development strategy. In addition, the ISN and the CPS helped rebuild the presence of
the World Bank in Panama after a period of over five years of limited involvement. The
preparation of the Completion Report has benefited from available AAA and project
documentation, including Implementation Status Reviews (ISRs). The CPS Progress Report
(Report No.47725-PA), and its review of the program, has been a valuable input, as have been
the Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs) available and the inputs from the sector teams.
I.

Background and Challenges at the point of Design

2.
The governments that followed the ouster of General Manuel Noriega at the end of 1989
dismantled a labyrinth of trade barriers and price controls and implemented a broad privatization
program accompanied by anti-trust and consumer protection regulation. After a slow-down in the
early 2000s, the Torrijos administration (2004-2009) infused a new dynamism to the reforms that
enhanced economic performance. But, Panama with a population of about 3.5 million, a world
famous canal, a modern financial center and a per capita GDP that ranks it as an upper-middle
income nation, remained a country of stark contrasts. Most notable was the very high degree of
inequality, perpetuated by dramatic educational disparities, differential access to basic services,
and wide discrepancies in productivity and incomes.
3.

As the CPS was designed, Panama continued to face the following challenges:
x Keeping the economy growing at a high rate;
x Incorporating the poor and the excluded; and
x Increasing the efficiency and transparency of Government and building a strong
human capital base.

Keeping the economy growing
4.
Previous to the FY08-FY10 CPS, the Panamanian economy had been growing fast and
the expectation was that it would continue to grow at a similar pace. From 2004 to 2006
Panama’s economy grew on average over 7.5 percent per year, driven by a favorable external
environment and facilitated by internal reforms and macroeconomic discipline. The prospects for
economic growth were enhanced by the decision, approved by Panamanians through a national
referendum in October 2006, to create a third set of locks to expand the Panama Canal, with
investments close to 30 percent of GDP. In addition, in June 2007, Panama and the United States

56

signed a Free Trade Agreement that would enhance the opportunities for international trade and
investment by providing a more stable platform.
5.
The challenge was then to create conditions for economic agents to profit from these
opportunities, thus generating incomes and employment, particularly for the poor and excluded.
Besides the need of a healthy macroeconomic environment, the Government strategy and the
analytical work coincided in identifying several key priorities that included: (a) reducing the
costs for business to comply with regulatory norms; (b) increasing the supply of skilled and well
trained personnel; and, (c) encouraging attention to technology development and adoption,
especially by the small and medium enterprise sector. Given the high levels of poverty in rural
areas, incomes and productivity in the rural economy were also key concerns.
Incorporating the poor and the excluded
6.
Despite being an upper-middle income country, Panama had been characterized by a high
degree of inequality. Between 1997 and 2003 (years for which there were living standard
measurement surveys available) the overall poverty levels, measured by individual consumption,
had marginally decreased from 37.3 percent to 36.8 percent, while extreme poverty declined
from 18.8 percent to 16.6 percent. But although the Gini coefficient for consumption declined
from 48.5 to 46.9, the coefficient remained above the average for Latin America countries and
countries with a similar level of per capita income. Moreover, during the same period, the share
of the extremely poor living in indigenous areas had increased from 35 percent in 1997 to 42
percent in 2003 and the share of the poor living in urban areas had almost doubled from 9 to 16
percent. The majority of the poor (57 percent) were less than 20 years old. In addition, poverty
pressures had increasingly pushed people to exploit the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor’s
natural resources which are among the most biologically diverse in the world, in unsustainable
ways.
7.
While the information on poverty incidence was likely to be obsolete by 2007, it
highlighted the main challenges to reach the poor and to generate opportunities to all. This
would require better access to education given that poor adult Panamanians averaged just over 5
years of schooling in 2003 and indigenous adults averaged a meager 3 years. Similarly, moving
away from the traditional approach of social assistance, which relied on universal subsidies,
towards greater targeting of social programs could improve the effectiveness of these programs
and thus social outcomes.
Improving the quality and transparency of public expenditure
8.
The CPS document emphasized that the public sector in Panama did not so much lack
resources as it lacked re-distributional effectiveness. Panama was spending 17 percent of GDP in
the social sectors, above other countries in Latin America, but its outcomes were not
commensurate with that level of expenditure. Social assistance expenditure, around 1 percent of
GDP, had historically gone to universal subsidies including price subsidies for electricity,
cooking oil and piped water, services out of reach to the poor. As highlighted in the Panama
Poverty Assessment (2007), the relatively high levels of poverty in Panama were not due to lack
of social spending, but rather to inadequate targeting, efficiency and effectiveness of
Government programs. Likewise, the state could improve its support for economic activity in
57

areas where it was involved: providing and maintaining infrastructure, educating the population,
supporting innovation, and regulating efficiently. The 2007 Panama Country Financial
Accountability and Procurement Assessment Report (CFAPAR) pointed to the need to
modernize the public financial management and procurement regimes, taking stock as well as
proposing a roadmap for reform.
The Government Program
9.
The Government Program of the Torrijos Administration had been designed for tackling
these challenges through an ambitious transformational strategy, summarized in Table 1 of the
Appendix, that stood on four pillars:
x Pillar I: Reduced Poverty and Inequality;
x Pillar II: Promote Economic Growth and Employment;
x Pillar III: Reform Public Finances and Modernize the State;
x Pillar IV: Develop Human Capital
10.
Building on the structural reform process that was suspended after 1999, this strategy
emphasized fiscal discipline, transparency and greater efficiency as crucial elements for ensuring
a sound economic base, accelerating export-led economic growth, creating more jobs and
reducing poverty. The Torrijos administration set an ambitious goal of lowering poverty by onefifth during its term in office and prioritized investments in human capital (including a big effort
to modernize education and training) and targeted social assistance (including the introduction of
a flagship targeted conditional cash transfer program and the continued expansion of pre-school
education and primary health care, especially in poor and indigenous areas) as hallmarks of this
effort.
The FY08-FY10 CPS Program
11.
The CPS and the preceding ISN supported selected aspects of the strategic vision of the
Torrijos administration organized around four broad objectives as summarized in Table 1, copied
from the CPS document.

12.
The FY06-FY07 ISN rejuvenated the Bank’s agenda in Panama after it dropped off
dramatically between 2000 and 2004. The ISN’s new analytical work contributed to a robust
policy dialogue and the project pipeline was rebuilt. The design of the CPS benefited from the
ISN experience. At the time of CPS approval there were five projects under implementation,
three of which had been approved during the previous ISN. The CPS design relied on a DPL
series to support and track delivery of the bulk of the expected results. The investment and TA
portfolio was to assist the Government in achieving results. Given the youth of the program, the
CPS was clear that in several areas results would be coming in the follow-up CPS. The results
matrix noted when this would be the case.
13.
The CPS included a lending envelop of US$390-US$465 million over FY08-FY10, with
new financing split mainly between Development Policy Lending and seven new povertyfocused investment projects. The design of the CPS was assisted by recently completed AAA:
Country Financial Accountability Assessment/Procurement Assessment Review; Public
Expenditure Review; Poverty Assessment; and Urban Transport Study.
59

14.

The CPS was designed for a three year period to coincide with the political cycle.

Sound macroeconomic management together with a positive external environment led
to strong economic growth. Panama reduced its public debt from a peak of 62.2 percent of GDP
in 2004 to 38 percent in 2008 as a result of the high economic growth and tight fiscal stance that
turned from a deficit of about 5 percent of GDP in 2004 into surpluses of 3.5 percent in 2007 and
0.4 in 2008. The strong fiscal stance was aided by a strong revenue performance that included
greater transfers from the Panama Canal and advances in tax policy and administration. CPI
year-on-year inflation peaked at 10 percent in September 2008 driven by food and commodity
prices as well as strong internal and external demand; however, it had fallen to 4.3 percent yearto-year in January 2009. In 2008, Standard and Poor upgraded Panama’s long-term foreign and
local currency issues default ratings from BB to BB+, while Fitch affirmed Panama’s BB+
rating, revising the outlook to positive. The average economic growth in 2007 and 2008 was 11.4
percent. Recently, on March 23, 2010, Panama achieved an investment grade credit rating from
Fitch for its sovereign bonds; and a few weeks later from Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s.
16.
The global crisis hit Panama hard, but Panama was well prepared to deal with it.
Panama did relatively well during the crisis with a rate of economic growth of 2.4 in 2009. The
fiscal balance shifted from surplus (2006-2009) to a deficit of 1 percent in 2009. Total public
debt increased from 38.8 percent of GDP in 2008 to 40 percent in 2009. Revenues and grants
dropped to 27.2 of GDP but they are still higher than in 2005 (24.3 percent.) The slowdown was
felt primarily by those sectors most directly affected by the fall in demand, like agriculture, trade
and construction.
17.
Poverty incidence decreased but it remains high for the level of income, especially in
rural areas and among the indigenous populations. The poverty incidence dropped from 36.8
percent in 2003 to 32.7 percent in 2008, in line with Government expectations. During the same
period absolute poverty dropped from 16.6 percent to 14.4 percent. Poverty remains high in rural
areas (59.7 percent) and especially among the indigenous populations (96.3 percent)—here, the
goal of the Government program was not met. The poverty gap is particularly high, at (67
percent) amongst the indigenous populations, and low in urban areas (4.7 percent). Sharing
growth remains a major challenge in Panama.
18.
Social Sectors outcomes: It is difficult to report on progress on social indicators given
the lack of up-to-date information and the relatively short three-year period of the CPS. Taking a
longer perspective (2000-2007) a varied picture emerges. The latest stocktaking of the MDGs21
notes that Panama is one of the countries likely to reach most of the MDG objectives. It notes
likewise that the Human Development Index (UNDP) increased from 2001 to 2007 and now
Panama ranks 62 amongst 177 countries. It also notes that poorest regions have been catching
up. Life expectancy has increased by 4 years since 2000. Still, progress was uneven and overall
economic growth has not changed fundamental structural patterns. Exclusion remains strong in
rural and indigenous areas. For instance, the poorest quintile has marginally increased its share of
consumption to a still low 4 percent in 2008. Quality of education is a major concern.

III.

Delivery of CPS Results and World Bank Contribution

19.
This section reports on the impact of the Bank program and is organized along the four
objectives of the CPS. Each section presents the objectives and discusses the relevance of the
program and then reports on the results as presented in the Annex 4 to the CPS and the
discussion of the main text of the CPS. Each section ends with a summary.
CPS objective 1: Reducing Poverty and Inequality
20.
The CPS program supported efforts to reduce poverty, especially among rural poor and
indigenous groups. The focus of results was in two broad areas: improving the targeting and
effectiveness of social assistance, and supporting sustainable increases in rural productivity.
Support for the first area came through Public Policy Reform TA loan and Social Protection
project. A Poverty Assessment was to complement work planned under the TA loan, with
impact to be captured through TA loan indicators. Rural productivity was to be supported by an
on-going Land Administration project and recently approved Rural Productivity Project and its
GEF counterpart, which funds sustainable use of the Atlantic Mesoamerican Biological Corridor.
A Rural Microfinance project, yet to be designed, was to support sustainability of outcomes in
the land and rural productivity programs.
CCT
21.
The Bank supported the update of poverty information and its use to better target
assistance to the poor. When the program Red de Oportunidades22 was launched, information on
poverty was available from the 2003 and 1997 LSMS poverty profiles and the resulting poverty
maps. Based on this information, the Social Protection Project and the Poverty Assessment of
2007 contributed to the design of the targeting mechanism of the CCT. In addition, the Social
Protection Project has supported the Management Information System of the program. The CCT
supports efforts at reducing the "vicious" cycle of poverty by conditioning payments to the
demand of services.
22.
The CCT is well targeted. The CCT program targets beneficiaries by combining regional
targeting and the application of a Proxy-Means Test to estimate the vulnerability and eligibility
of households, differentiating between urban, rural, and indigenous areas. The evidence shows
that the CCT subsidy is well targeted.23 In 2008, 83.7 percent of the transfers were going to the
lowest income quintile of the population. 98.4 percent went to the two lowest quintiles. The

 In early 2006, the Government launched the Red de Oportunidades (RdO) with the aim of reducing both demand
and supply barriers impeding access to basic social services through targeted support for the extreme poor and
vulnerable households with children in Panama. The program involved five main elements: (a) a conditional cash
transfer program, (b) supply of basic services linked to co-responsibilities (education, health and legal identification
of beneficiaries), (c) support to beneficiary families to boost their demand for these services, (d) rural infrastructure
(public works, housing, agricultural development), and (e) program management, monitoring and evaluation. The
CCT linked the transfers to the most vulnerable sections of the population to investments in the education and health
of the children of the beneficiary families

CCT was the best targeted to the poor social assistance program in the country. The CCT
program in 2008 spent 0.8% of GDP, which was a relatively small portion of the budget
allocated to social assistance programs for the poor. This suggests that there is ample space to
improve the impact of social assistance by utilizing the CCT framework in other programs or
through the consolidation of programs.
23.
During implementation, the CPS program was amended to support the authorities’
efforts to contain the impact of the food and fuel crisis and the global economic crisis on the
poor. The food and global crisis called for additional efforts that further advanced the
implementation of the CPS program helping achieve results that were foreseen for the follow-up
CPS, such as increasing the coverage of the CCT. To help mitigate the negative impact of
external shocks on the poor, in 2008, the Government took important steps by adopting a threepronged response to the external economic shocks. First, social programs were strengthened
through an increase in the size of the conditional cash transfer program and an improvement in
the targeting of other social programs. Second, the quality and coverage of health and nutrition
services to the extreme poor were strengthened. Third, the Government committed to
maintaining levels of social spending during the economic deceleration, despite overall cuts in
fiscal spending. The Bank’s “Protecting the Poor under Global Uncertainty” DPL (FY09), the
Social Protection Project and the Health Equity and Performance Improvement Project supported
these efforts.
24.
The Government increased the coverage and the real value of the conditional cash
transfers and extended the use of its data base to target other programs. The Government
progressively expanded the Red de Oportunidades to cover all regions and indigenous areas and
today the program covers 367,378 people (11 percent of the population). This coverage (over
70,000 families) is higher than the 60,000 poor households with children that the CPS foresaw as
a target for the next strategy. Also, the Government raised the monthly transfer amount from B.
/35 to B. /50 for all beneficiaries, increasing real value of the transfer. The DPL and technical
assistance under the Social Protection Project helped the Government to improve targeting of
other social programs by using the household registry and management information system
developed for the CCT program. The social programs that currently use the CCT targeting
mechanism to identify beneficiaries include: (a) income generating activities for disabled people;
(b) agricultural training programs executed by INADEH; and (c) a housing improvement
program for the poor.
25.
Mechanisms are in place to assure financial resources for social priorities. In 2006, the
Government initiated a national dialogue around priorities for the country and its development
agenda. Representatives from a broad range of social, political, religious, professional, and social
organizations participated in this process and endorsed the agreement. The document Acuerdos
de la Concertación Nacional para el Desarrollo of October 2007 summarized the agreements
that included using partially increased fiscal revenues arising from the Panama Canal expansion
to finance social programs. Law 20 established a legal basis for the National Council for the
National Development Dialogue, the Presidential Secretary of Goals and the Social Cabinet. The
Council and the Secretary are responsible for verifying the implementation and goals of the
Concertación Nacional, while the Social Cabinet is responsible for the coordination of all social
agencies in the implementation of the Agreements. This initiative remains under implementation.
63

Rural Productivity
26.
Support for rural productivity has proceeded at a slower pace.
Delivery of
outcomes has come mainly through the Land Administration project that has supported the
revision of titling procedures through the Law on Massive Land Titling approved in June 2006
and its implementing regulation. An alternative conflict resolution mechanism is in place and has
contributed to solve around 500 cases. Half of the country has been photographed. 56.550
parcels haven surveyed and 12,422 titles have been issued in Chiriqui, Veraguas, and Bocas del
Toro, 113 percent and 104 percent of the target set under the CPS. Estimation of the time and
cost it takes to register a parcel of land is in process, but not yet available. In respect of the
Inspection Panel claim submitted last year, Bank staff has been meeting with both groups of
Requesters (Naso and Ngäbe). The Rural Productivity Project and its GEF counterpart had
faced implementation difficulties and results will come only in the next strategy. The proposed
rural micro-finance operation was dropped. So was as proposed Access to Land operation.
Summary of Results and Development Impact:
27.
The Completion Report rates as satisfactory the achievement of results under the
first CPS objective. The setting in place of a targeting social assistance system covering around
11 percent of the population is a major achievement, especially when in 2006 no such targeting
was in place. Targeting is good as 2008 LSMS survey results show that close to 100 percent of
CCT beneficiaries are in the lowest two quintiles of the population. Coverage exceeded
expectations set under the CPS. In addition, the Government, with Bank assistance, is using the
CCT platform to target delivery of other programs, with a spillover impact on health and
education outcomes. The new administration is committed to continue perfecting the system,
increasing the targeting effectiveness and the coverage; thus the sustainability of these efforts
appears assured. Further targeting improvements are underway based on the 2008 LSMS survey.
As noted poverty dropped from 1997 to 2007, but it remains high particularly in rural areas and
amongst the indigenous population. One of the reasons that explain the slow gains is that
amongst these rural and the indigenous population the depth of poverty is quite large, which
means that the efforts must be sustained and strengthened.
CPS Strategic Objective II: Promoting Economic Growth
28.
The CPS sought to support broad-based economic growth in three priority areas: a
more competitive national-level business environment (focusing on regulation – including more
transparent and streamlined regulatory processes, worker training and innovation support), urban
transport planning in Panama City including mass transit infrastructure, and sustainable tourism
outside Panama City which would focus on policy, the business environment and infrastructure
needs in specific areas. The first area was to be supported by the DPL series and the on-going
Public Policy TA loan and the 2008 CEM. The programmatic DPL series was foreseen as the
main instrument to deliver outcomes. Urban transport interventions were to be built on
completed TA. A Sustainable Tourism project was to be guided by the planned Country
Environmental Analysis and have links to the Rural Microfinance project. The Global crisis
shifted attention to the financial sector, which the Bank supported through the “Protecting the
Poor under Global Uncertainty DPL”.
64

Governance and Regulatory Frameworks


29.
Focusing on facilitating business was highly relevant to the diversification of
Panama’s sources of growth in the wake of the country’s FTAs and for taking advantage of
new investment opportunities associated with the Canal expansion project. It was here that the
gap was the largest with respect to international best practices in the area of regulation. The
World Bank’s Doing Business reports indicated that in Panama the levels of regulatory noncompliance and informality were higher than in the rest of LAC and the OECD and that
procedures to comply with tax and labor regulations and those needed to enforce contracts were
burdensome. At the same time, according to WEF and Transparency International the incidence
of corruption in Panama is similar to that found in the rest of Latin America, which in turn lags
considerably behind the OECD. To the contrary, in infrastructure and access to finance
performance was closer to that of OECD countries than to the average for the Latin America
Region (LAC). The World Economic Forum (WEF), for example, rated the quality of Panama’s
infrastructure above the average for LAC. Moreover, domestic credit to the private sector as a
share of GDP was about three times as high in Panama than in the rest of Latin America.
30.
The Government launched and the Bank supported a program to facilitate the
interface between public agencies and private entities. Leadership for the implementation of
the program was given to the “Secretariat of the Presidency for Governmental Innovation”
(SPIG) and received technical support from the Governments of Chile and Korea, as well as
through the Bank’s Public Policy Reform Technical Assistance project.24 The ambitious
program was at the core of the Government’s agenda to develop electronic government and has
produced effective results of the ground, including important by products like facilitating on-line
transactions between private parties (electronic commerce.)25 The next paragraphs summarize
some of the main achievements. It is worth noting that implementation has been difficult because
it has required the coordination of several ministries at different stages of e-readiness. With
hindsight, implementation of the strategy would have benefited from an “execution roadmap” to
facilitate coordination, monitoring, control and evaluation of progress being made, particularly
given the complexity of reforms supported in the area of digitalization.
31.
The internet portal “PanamaTramita” is becoming a digital one-stop shop for over 80
transactions between Government entities, private sector enterprises, and public in general. In
May 2006, “PanamaTramita” was launched to allow individuals to process through the internet
passports, identity cards, Government-issued certificates, and similar activities. After preparing a
detailed inventory of bureaucratic procedures in all Government institutions, SPIG started
incorporating the option of completing selected procedures on-line. By June 2008,
“PanamaTramita” already allowed 81 different types of on-line transactions. By April 2009, 90


24
 SPIG consulted with various civil society, private sector and Government organizations represented at the
National Competitiveness Center and gave priority to those procedures that are more frequently used and for which
administrative improvements would be expected to have a larger impact on the enterprise sector or the general
population. 

65

different transactions have been completely digitalized.26 Additionally, the portal provides
information on the documentation requirements for other processes that are not yet fully
digitalized.
32.
Most new businesses in Panama only require informing the State that they are starting
a new operation. Law 5 of January 2007, implemented in July 2007, launched the internet portal
- “PanamaEmprende” that allows on-line registration of most firms, through the Operation
Notice, which is now the only step required for starting most commercial, industrial or service
activity in the country.27 Operation Notice automatically triggers other registrations, such as the
Taxpayer's Unique Registry (RUC) and the Registry of New Businesses before the relevant
municipality. Fees can be paid electronically. According the Ministry of Commerce and
Industry, the time needed to get a license dropped from 30 days to 20 minutes.28 The public may
access the system and obtain information on the companies doing business. By enhancing
transparency, PanamaEmprende, a digital “one-stop window”, reduces irregular payments or
undue delays in the process and facilitates formalization of economic activity, one of the main
challenges in the country.
33.
Similar efforts are underway to further facilitate international trade by migrating
transactions to the internet. SPIG began introducing a digitalized Ventanilla Única with the aim
to become an on-line tool for all export-import processes. Implementation has been delayed. By
December 2008, a strategic design for the digitalization of the processes had been completed, but
the Government decided to extend coverage beyond import-export information. This new portal,
Panamarket, is being designed. However, digitalization of other international trade transactions
has been completed: AMP for the registration of cargo ships, and SDMC to control commercial
goods movements in the Colon Free Trade Zone and facilitate interaction between traders, banks,
and customs.29
34.
The Government undertook other initiatives to improve the regulatory framework for
doing business. In the area of contract enforcement, with support from the IDB, UNDP and
bilateral aid agencies, the GOP is implementing an ambitious program of reform of the justice
system aimed at increasing its independence, transparency and efficiency. This judicial reform
program, coupled with other policy actions, aims at increasing public sector transparency and
efficiency by modernizing the Government’s financial management system. This reform is
expected to help reduce the incidence of corruption and create further incentives for regulatory
compliance. In tax administration, the Government focused on improving filing, audit and
collection procedures to increase enforcement of tax regulations and facilitate tax compliance.
(See discussion of taxation under the third pillar).

26
 It should be highlighted that through the PanamaTramita portal and links, the GOP has been able to reduce as of
August 2008, 241 bureaucratic transactions that were either consolidated or eliminated altogether, with a positive
impact on time and costs for business and individuals.
27
Exceptions to the rule include regulated activities (i.e. banking, insurance, liquor sales, security services, etc.) that
need to first go to their regulatory bodies before completing the Operation Notice.
28
Please note that the 2010 Doing Business quotes 12 days to start a business, an improvement from 18 days in
2008, but still higher than the government quote. The difference may be due to the fact that certain regulated
activities have to go to additional procedures.
29
Panama rates high in trading across borders—10 in the 2010 Doing Business.

Training, skills and technology
35.
Skills and technology were highly relevant to the continued expansion of the economy
in a wide range of areas that included tourism, construction, and high tech services, which
benefit from the transportation and telecommunications infrastructure available in the Canal area.
Panamanian firms tended to invest less in workers’ training and in innovation than do their
counterparts from other emerging countries. Likewise, in comparison with the rest of Latin
America, Panama was investing less in research and development (R&D) activities as a percent
of GDP, and employing fewer researchers as a share of the population. These constrains were
already being felt by the emerging non-traditional exports.
36.
The Government launched an ambitious program to upgrade the skills of the labor
force in preparation for the expected increase in demand for semi-skilled and skilled labor
from the canal expansion project and the FTA with the U.S. Decree Law 8 of February 2006
set a new framework for training under principles that emphasized meeting the needs of the
private sector and the labor market, cooperation between public and private supply, efficiency,
social inclusion, transparency and accountability. The Decree Law gave a leadership role to a
restructured National Training Institute (“Instituto Nacional de Formación Profesional y
Capacitación para el Desarrollo Humano’’, INADEH), whose mandate included: (a) the
evaluation and accreditation of public and private providers; and (b) the certification of workers
participating in competency-based training. In addition, the Government consolidated all public
training resources in a new National Fiduciary Training Fund, under INADEH management, and
increased allocations from about US$8 million in 2005, to US$9l million in 2008.
37.
Certification of training activities has advanced as planned. To develop a competencybased training system, INADEH has been collaborating with a bipartite non-governmental
organization - the Labor Foundation (“Fundación del Trabajo”)- and building upon the
experience developed by this Foundation through a pilot program financed by IDB. INADEH
has completed the norms for the issuance of competency standards for a total of 23 certifications
covering selected occupations from strategic sectors of the economy - among others - tourism,
construction, and agro-industry.
38.
The overhaul of the training system has exceeded expectations. In October 2006,
INADEH launched the National Training Plan with a target of training 200,000 workers by the
end of 2008 in selected priority areas which were determined on the basis of public
consultations, and include tourism, construction, agriculture, transport and other services. That
target has been met and exceeded only in 2008 through over 400 training programs. (See Table 2
in the Appendix.) To assure quality, INADEH has been evaluating training providers under the
supervision of the National Commission of Quality Assurance which was created by Decree Law
8.
39.
In December 2005 the GOP issued its National Strategic Plan for the Development of
Science, Technology and Innovation, which was based on extensive consultations with all
stakeholders. The implementation of the Plan was assigned to the National Secretariat for

67

Science, Technology and Innovation (SENACYT).30 Following on the development of the Plan,
on 14th December 2007, the Law #56 established the National Research System (Sistema de
Investigación Nacional), with mechanisms to promote research activities that are incorporated in
the legislation and are similar to those already implemented in Argentina, Chile, Colombia,
Mexico and Brazil. The funds to be destined to the new system would be allocated using
transparent technical evaluation mechanisms similar to those used for selecting the R&D and
innovation projects financed through matching grants, as defined in the original plan.
40.
Financing for science and technology has been increased. To enable SENACYT to
execute its responsibilities, budgetary resources were increased from about US$1 M to US$14 M
between 2005 and 2007 and US$22 M in 2008 (a 57 percent increase from the previous year). In
addition, budget execution increased from around 77 percent during the period 2005-2006 to 93
percent in 2007 and 2008. In addition, the share of the budget allocated to investments has
increased from 57 percent in 2004-2007 to 85 in 2008. With these resources, SENACYT has
financed matching grants and specific R&D Innovation activities.
41.
It is too early for an in-depth evaluation of impact. Given that investments in science
and technology have a long maturation process and since SENACYT’s matching grant and
scholarship programs were introduced fairly recently, it is too early to assess the impact of these
programs. However, SENACYT estimates that most, if not all, the projects supported under the
innovation program will generate technological innovations in the form of new products, new
services, or significant improvements in existing products or services. Over 60 percent of the
funds allocated to the financing of R&D projects during the period 2004-09 have been to the bioscience and agri-business sectors. Additionally – during the same period - there have been 181
projects related to innovation and the promotion of science and technology financed for an
amount of US$5.8M. All together, this adds to a total of projects financed for US$14.4M. Future
impact evaluations would benefit from a more expeditious production of statistics.
Finance
42.
Panama’s financial sector was relatively well positioned going into the crisis and the
Government took prompt actions to contain potential problems. A high degree of compliance
with Basel core principles signaled a well regulated financial sector, where asset quality was
good with non-performing loans at 1.4 percent of total loans, provisioned at 130 percent. Still,
the country amended the 1998 Banking Law to strengthen regulation and supervision on a
consolidated basis. The revised law gave instruments to deal with the crisis. Enhanced auditing
authority increased the ability of the authorities to understand and follow the impact of the crisis.
Strengthening of capital requirements and powers to modify required ratios made it possible to
deal with exceptional risks. New procedures were introduced to deal with trouble banks. Finance

 SENACYT was created in 1997 and was given administrative autonomy by Law 50 in December 2005.
Implementation encompasses the cooperation and interaction of the CNCYT (National Commission of Science and
Technology), the CICYT (Science, Technology, and Innovation Inter-ministerial Commission), SENACYT
(National Secretary for Science, Technology and Innovation), and 13 Sector Commissions representing public,
private, academic, and social sectors.

sector performance remains strong after the crisis. The Bank supported these initiatives through
the 2009 “Protecting the Poor” DPL. The financial sector has gone through the crisis unscathed.
Summary of Results and Development Impact
43.
The Completion Report rates as satisfactory the achievement of results under the
second CPS objective. Solid results were achieved in several areas. Most notable has been the
expansion of the training system, which has exceeded expectations. The rapid response of the
authorities and the Bank to take preventive actions in the financial sector to protect against the
crisis are likewise noteworthy. Efforts at simplifying regulation through direct internet interface
between the Government and the population cover over 90 transactions and are facilitating
company registration, which is now automatic for most new companies. According to the 2010
Doing Business Panama ranks 77 in the world (83 in 2009), the best ranked country in Central
America, but below neighbors like Colombia at 37. Panama does best in starting a business (27)
and trading across borders (10). It is too early to judge the effectiveness of the investments in
research and development. Work that the CPS foresaw in urban transport or sustainable tourism
has been either postponed or cancelled.
CPS Pillar III: Strengthen Public Financial Management
44.
The CPS supported the establishment of modern public financial management (PFM)
systems and institutions. Bank support focused on various interrelated areas that covered (a)
macroeconomic and fiscal management; (b) providing a solid institutional foundation for fiscal
policy and fiscal management, including the alignment of budgetary allocation with national
priorities; (c) modern and competitive procurement practices; and, (d) improved treasury
effectiveness. The ambitious agenda had the support of the programmatic DPL series that also
tracked improvements as well as technical assistance from the Public Policy TA loan and the
Debt Management Technical Assistance program (provided by the Bank’s Treasury
Department). The 2007 CFAPAR provided the technical diagnosis of most of the interventions.
(Chart 1 in the Appendix reproduces information from the ICR of the DPL series that is relevant
to assess the progress made in PFM).31
Macroeconomic and Fiscal Management
45.
The Government maintained a stable fiscal framework in line with the Government’s
debt and fiscal deficit targets. As already noted and confirmed by the IMF Article IV
surveillance mission,32 Panama maintained a prudent fiscal management before and during the
crisis and as a result has protected the international credit rating of its debt. Public debt level
dropped to reach 38 percent of GDP in 2008 surpassing Government’s expectations. The new
administration has substantially reduced the stock of budget arrears still in place. The

The Results Matrix of the CPS proposed to rely on PEFA indicators to track progress for some of the results
under this objective. Please take note that no formal PEFA reviews have been undertaken in Panama. The 2006
Country Financial Accountability and Procurement Assessment Report took stock following a PEFA framework.
The DPL Competitiveness and DPL series tracked progress following a PEFA like methodology and reported on the
progress. See ICR DPL.
32
The mission took place in March 2009.

69

nonfinancial public sector balance remained positive during the last three years, despite a large
increase in public investment of 7 percent of GDP in 2008, and additional social expenditures in
the range of 1 percent of GDP to compensate for higher costs of living. This positive
development was possible due to a favorable external environment, as well as fiscal reforms
implemented in earlier years, which led to higher revenues. Furthermore, the Government
managed to contain current spending, mostly through a reduction of the share of wages, social
security deficits and pensions, but also due to lower overall interest payments. Given this
positive development, which is also reflected in its EMBI spread (see Chart 1), Panama was one
of the few Latin American countries that were able to tap the international capital markets in
2009.33 The project supported reforms played an important role in achieving this overall
satisfactory outcome.
46.
Bank support had an impact on public debt management, but Panama needs to
develop its domestic debt market. World Bank technical support helped the Government better
understand the available data on debt and assess costs and risks associated with individual
strategies. As a result, the Government extended the average debt maturities, and was able to
lower the costs of borrowing. The pro-active reaction of Government to a drying up of the
international capital markets in the fall of 2008 by seeking additional financing from donors to
secure and by entering the international debt markets promptly were signs of increased debtmanagement capacity. Looking forward, the Government would benefit from continuous
evaluation of the debt profile, the costs and the risks and the development of the local debt
market, which is of particular relevance given the size and importance of the banking system in
the country.
47.
Fiscal Revenues increased due to higher transfers from the canal and higher tax
revenue mobilization as a result of reforms in tax administration, which were supported
under the DPL program. Overall public revenues increased from 15.1 percent of GDP in 2005
to 19.7 percent in 2008. Tax revenues over GDP, in turn, increased from 8.7 in 2005 to 10.6 in
2008. The administrative reforms included the development by the Dirección General de
Ingresos (DGI) of monthly audit strategies that single out outliers and potential inconsistencies in
reporting. Some of the results of these reforms are that growth rates for direct taxes paid by legal
entities averaged around 60 percent between 2004 and 2008 and the number of legal entities
filing taxes increased by 14 percent during 2005 and 2007. Additionally and mandated by law,
all direct taxes now are being submitted electronically, either in the form of disks, or via on-line
transfers (see Figure G1.1). This requirement has put some additional strain on the taxpayer, in
particular given the low computer penetration and internet access of the population, but helped
bring down internal processing times and costs. Further reforms might be warranted in the area
of tax reimbursements, which continue to be cumbersome, both for the DGI and the taxpayer. 34

Early 2009 saw some resumption of external issuances by a few of the higher-rated sovereigns in the region:
Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Panama, and Peru were all able to tap global capital markets. Panama successfully
placed USD 323 million in bonds on the international bond markets in March 2009.
34
Note, however, that the 2010 Doing Business ranks paying taxes low at 173, with the number of hours required
unchanged. The ICR to the DPL series notes that the Doing Business survey includes a broad range of payment and
hence may not capture selective simplification well.

Institutional Foundations for fiscal policy and management
48.
A Social and Fiscal Responsibility Law was enacted in June 2008, with technical
support from both the IMF and the World Bank. Building on a previous law35 and taking
account of accumulated experience, the Law sets a framework for fiscal management. First, it
stipulated that the fiscal deficit should not be higher than 1 percent of GDP36, unless economic
growth drops below 1 percent, and that the total public debt should stay below 40 percent of
GDP from 2015 on.37 Second, the law included provisions to enhance the fiscal accounts, and to
increase fiscal transparency through provisions of periodic compliance reports and increased
public access to the medium-term fiscal framework. The law became effective in January 2009.
As noted Panama’s deficit in 2009 was below 1 percent. The Law sets a framework upon which
to build solid fiscal institutions, such operating medium-term fiscal frameworks and results
budgeting, thus addressing the weaknesses in place today.
Public Procurement
49.
In 2006, Panama began a significant overhaul of its public procurement system. Law
No. 22 of 2006 launched a major public procurement overhaul. The thrust of the reform
progress has been the implementation of PanamaCompra—an on-line platform for Government
purchases with the exception of the Panama Canal Authority (PCA), the Social Security
Administration and the municipalities. PanamaCompra has covered publication of information
on Government procurement needs and since its introduction in December 2006, more than
200,000 contracts for a total amount of around US$2.5 billion were made publicly available
through PanamaCompra (May 2009).38
50.
Next, Panama introduced performance contracts, with technical assistance from the
Bank and the support of the DPL series. Suppliers bid for eligibility under the performance
contract system and, if selected, their bids for the goods covered are available continuously over
the internet (PanamaCompra) for public agencies to choose. Public agencies can then select
from the available suppliers. In Panama, 21 annual framework contracts have been negotiated
since 2007,39 and savings in the range of US$100 million have been reaped so far based on
information from the authorities, including i.e. a US$5 million savings for fuel purchases.
Substantial gains have also been made in the time it takes to purchase goods—savings go from
59 days for small items to 33 days for major purchases.40 A 2008 survey showed that public
perception of the quality of procurement practices was higher for the national budget than for the
Canal Authority.

The Law was approved in 2002 but never really implemented in the absence of clear sanction mechanisms and
deficiencies in accountability.
36
Excluding the Panama Canal Authority.
37
This includes debt held by the Social Security Administration, but excludes the Fiduciary Fund – a trust that was
established in the 90s to invest privatization proceeds.
38
Based on a recent management report of the GDCP, more than 8,219 public contracts were minor purchases
whose value did not exceed US$30 thousand, 6,928 direct purchases, 281 bids for best value, 3,293 public tenders
and 31,677 purchase orders through the Electronic Products and Services Catalog PanamaCompra.
39
Including renegotiated contracts.
40
Solid information is available on the broad gains under the program as in available upon request.

71

51.
To streamline processes, in July 2008, the Government of Panama created the
Dirección General de Contrataciones Públicas (DGCP), which is in charge of modernizing
and coordinating the procurement process for the public sector. The DGCP has been tracking
performance of the new system and its findings confirm gains, especially through performance
contracts. The DGCP introduced in April/May 2010 PanamaCompra 2 which allows bidding
online and is likely to generate additional savings and further limit the opportunities for
corruption. In February 2009, the DGCP published a Strategic Plan for public sector
procurement, which was developed with World Bank support. The strategy is publicly
available,41 provides a road map of reforms needed to foster the digitalization of the
Government’s procurement processes, coordinates the implementation and harmonization in
various agencies, and also provides monitoring tools to measure actual progress.
Treasury Effectiveness
52.
Budget execution has improved, especially treasury payment effectiveness.
Supported by the IDB, the Government is introducing a National Integrated Financial
Management System (SIAFPA). To track processing time for payment verification, the General
Comptroller’s Office (CGR) introduced a reporting tool, which allows identifying and removing
bottlenecks in internal processes. As a result, over 97 percent of all payments are now being
verified within 15 days after reception (with the majority being approved within 2-3 days),
compared to 67 percent in 2006. Payment times have been reduced from about 175 days in 2004
to close to 40 in 2008. (See Appendix Chart on Public Sector Performance).
Summary of Results and Development Impact
53.
The Completion Report rates as satisfactory the achievement of results under the
third CPS objective. Substantive achievements have been attained under this objective. First,
the authorities showed skill in addressing the impact of the crisis and macro and fiscal order was
kept in place, with the country maintaining the international rating of its debt. The Bank
contributed to these efforts with additional budget support and technical support. Second, in a
short period of time (2005 to 2009) the procurement reform in Panama has shown improvements
in designing state-of-the art tools that enhance efficiency of the supply management systems,
including purchasing strategies (i.e. framework contracts on fuel). Savings have been clearly
established. In April 2010 the country is launching PanamaCompra 2 that will allow bidding
online. Because of the progress in procurement, the Bank selected Panama as one of three
countries in Latin America for use of domestic country systems in Bank operations. The Bank
has been very active in providing technical assistance to the procurement reform. Third, the
Treasury is more effective in making payments and has reduced the time it takes to make a
payment to around a fifth of the 2004 value. Lastly, the Fiscal Responsibility Law provides a
platform for the GoP, under the leadership of the Ministry of Finance to further modernize
planning and budgeting, improve monitoring and evaluation and gradually introduce
performance budgeting. The Bank, jointly with the IMF, provided technical assistance in the
design of the Fiscal Responsibility Law. The New administration has committed to continue
working in this direction and thus the achievements under this CPS are likely to be sustainable.

CPS Objective IV: Improve health, nutrition, and education attainment of the poor.
54.
The CPS sought to help improve the health, nutrition, and education attainment of the
poor in four ways: expanding access to basic health and nutrition services for poor families
(through the recently approved Social Protection project and through the planned Health project),
increasing the supply of sustainable clean water and sanitation in low-income communities
(through the recently approved Water Supply and Sanitation to Low-Income Communities
project), and various interventions to improve education and access from pre-school through
secondary school (through the on-going Second Basic Education and the planned new education
project).
55.
The World Bank contributed to the increase in coverage of pre-school and
secondary education. The Second Basic Education Project and its Additional Financing (IBRD
LN 7032-PA/7483-PA) contributed significantly to improvements in preschool and secondary
education coverage. The preschool coverage of the 4-5 year-old children in the entire country
increased from 31 percent in 2001 to 61 percent in 2007, while the enrollment of these children
increased from 55,369 to 92,900 in the same period, 38,500 children as a consequence of the
project. The coverage of secondary also increased as a consequence of this project. From 20002007, net enrolment increased 58.5 percent to 64.6 percent in secondary school (12-17 years).
The number of Telebásicas established by the project was 3.8 times larger than the target set at
appraisal (114 as compared to 30). As a consequence, the number of primary graduate students
in rural areas with possibility to continue their lower secondary education (grades 7-9) went from
0 at the start of the project to 17,211 in 2008.
56.
An important by-product of the new training and skills policy is that INADEH is now
complementing the education system to reach social groups and geographic areas that had not
been served before. INADEH’s close work with universities is building a fruitful mutually
beneficial interaction with Private Sector entities and developing recognized certification norms
for selective occupations in high demand. INADEH implements its National Plan of Technical
Training to a large extent using Ministry of Education secondary technical education centers that
it supports through investments (close to 20 million). Some universities acknowledge credit for
technical courses taken at INADEH sponsored classes. In addition, it is reaching – in an
exceptional effort – indigenous communities and other less privileged social groups (single
parents and jobless youth) to include them in its programs and tailoring their courses for the
benefit of these communities.
57.
The incoming Government declined continued Bank assistance in education. The Basic
Education Quality Improvement Project was closed before it started its execution. This project
was designed to help improve quality of education. This project was deemed highly relevant as a
2005 evaluation (SINECA) had shown that 50 percent of 3rd and 6th graders score “deficient” in
all subjects and that the percentage increased to 70 percent in Spanish and 85 percent in
mathematics among 9th and 12th grades. Reportedly, the current administration will use other
approaches to remedy these deficiencies.—such as emphasis on magnet schools to improve
quality.

73

58.
The CPS began to work in health and nutrition areas where indicators in Panama
have lagged average Latin American performance. The Health Equity and Performance
Improvement Project that became effective in December 2008 is helping deliver a package of
basic health care services through mobile teams in rural areas outside the indigenous autonomous
areas by supporting the Estrategia de Extensión de Cobertura (EEC) program. The project
finances capitation payments to the regional health offices for them to organize the mobile teams
that provide services. By the end of 2009, most regional health offices were providing services
through these mobile teams. In addition, the Social Protection Project is financing mobile teams
that provide a basic package of health and nutrition services in indigenous areas that do not have
access to the fixed network of health facilities. The coverage is estimated at 290,000 people.
59.
In the context of the DPL and utilizing the technical support of the Health Equity and
Performance Improvement Project and the Social Protection Project, the Ministry of Health
expanded the geographical coverage of the health service package delivered in isolated and
poor areas through a more comprehensive inclusion of previously underserved areas. To do
so, the targeting mechanism of the Estrategia de Extensión de Cobertura (EEC) program was
improved to cover communities more than one hour away from a health center that has, at a
minimum, one doctor and one nurse. In the indigenous areas (Comarcas), the Ministry of Health
proceeded to identify the eligible communities and to assign a health provider. In 2008, more
than 400,000 families (including the 290,000 mentioned above) benefitted from the health
package in rural areas, including the indigenous Comarcas. In addition, the Government included
a comprehensive nutrition component in its package of basic health services delivered to poor
and isolated communities, as a part of the National Plan to Combat Child Malnutrition (2008-15)
produced by Ministry of Health and the National Nutrition Secretariat (SENAPAN). The plan
confirms the inclusion of an integrated package of nutritional services in the basic package of
preventive and promotion health services provided by the Coverage Extension Strategy,
Estrategia de Extensión de Cobertura (EEC), enhancing the sustainability of the initiative.
Summary of Results and Development Impact:
60.
The Completion Report rates as moderately satisfactory the achievement of results
under the fourth CPS objective. In education, the Bank contributed to increased enrollment in
pre-school and secondary education (2000-2007). Lack of updated information prevents an
assessment of recent national trends, but it all seems to indicate that the Government set itself far
too ambitious targets for education. As noted, significant concerns with the quality of education
remain. The CPS initial design foresaw initiating support in health and nutrition with expected
the bulk of results from these interventions (health, social assistance, water) to be achieved
during the next strategy, but the crisis meant that the Government engaged more forcefully in
health and nutrition utilizing innovative approaches that the Bank has advised and supported—
the Health Equity and Performance Improvement Project and the Social Protection Project. The
support in health and nutrition is utilizing the CCT infrastructure to better target interventions.
The Bank is well-placed to help the authorities strengthen further efforts in health and nutrition.
Lastly, the continued exclusion of the rural indigenous populations remains a critical concern
that will continue to require attention, including a critical examination of the current approaches.

74

Overall Results Rating
61.
The Completion Report rates as satisfactory the achievement of results under the CPS
objective. The CR is rating three of the objectives as satisfactory and one as moderately
satisfactory, which justifies the overall rating of satisfactory. This rating is consistent with the
satisfactory rating proposed by the ICR for the Competitiveness and Public Financial
Management Development Loan series. Overall, the rating of the CPS is warranted given that the
CPS contributed to major achievements of the Government program, such as the development
and putting in place of an extensive and well-targeted social assistance program; the
simplification of the interface between the Government and the public; the putting in place of
successful training program; the modernization of the public procurement system; the
introduction of a Fiscal Responsibility Law; and innovative approaches for addressing
deficiencies in health and education. Admittedly, in some areas (rural productivity, eco-tourism)
progress fell below expectations partly because dealing with the potential impact of the crisis
became a priority and partly because the program was overly ambitious to begin with.
IV.

Bank Performance

62.
New resources approved during the period fell below initial targets of US$390-465
million. The Bank approved US$370 million during this CPS period, of which US$255 million
were in budget support operations. The US$35 million education project was canceled. Three
projects were taken off the pipeline (land access, rural micro finance, and sustainable tourism).
Urban Transport, Social Protection II and Public Policy Reform TA2 will be delivered as part of
the next strategy. Six projects are under implementation now.
63.
The Bank adjusted in the Progress Report the CPS lending program to better support
Panama’s response to global economic shocks. Specifically, the lending program was adjusted
to increase the liquidity available to address actual and potential spending needs. To do so, DPL
II was increased by US$25 million to US$100 million and it was agreed that a third US$80
million Development Policy Loan – which had originally been seen as optional – would be
processed in FY09. The single tranche DPL (Protecting the Poor) provided timely support to the
Government to protect vulnerable groups in the context of the global economic crisis by
mitigating the impact of economic shocks on the poor and by reducing the risks of a potential
banking crisis.
64.
Portfolio performance in FY09-10 declined through the political transition, but this
effect is expected to be temporary. After growing to eight projects in FY09, the portfolio
stabilized at five projects and a GEF grant at the close of the CPS period (end FY10). The
undisbursed balance grew from US$84.9 million at the beginning of FY08 to US$153.2 at the
start of FY11. Over the CPS period, the portfolio performance declined due to temporary effects
of GOP fiscal constraints that limited activity in FY09 and from the political transition in mid2009. Following elections in May 2009, the new administration took office July 1, 2009. In
most cases, Government staff and consultants working directly on the implementation of Bankfinanced projects were retained until the end of 2009 and then in several cases replaced. The two
operations, the Rural Productivity project and the Water and Sanitation in Low Income
Communities project, which underwent the most significant changes in the staff involved in
75

project implementation had not yet recovered implementation performance by June 2010.
Despite the effects of the transition on implementation, the new administration has confirmed
that the portfolio of Bank –financed projects is well aligned with the priorities of the new
administration.42 The Bank expects that with continued intensive supervision and capacity
building support, the portfolio will return to zero projects at risk by January 2011 and that the
disbursement ratio will rise above 20% in FY11.

The Bank worked closely with both administrations to help minimize the impact of the
transition on the portfolio. Implementation of the portfolio spanned two administrations. The
Bank held a Country Portfolio Performance Review in March 2009 to benchmark progress,
identify issues and plan for the transition; including making sure operational manuals and project
files were up-to-date. During the transition period, the incoming administration agreed to keep
contracted project staff until the end of the calendar year to support continuity in
implementation. A CPPR was held with the new administration in December 2009 with followup “mini” CPPRs in January and March 2010. Unfortunately, these efforts were insufficient to
protect the portfolio in the short-term, but have helped in building a partnership with new
counterparts in both the Ministry of Economy and Finance and the line-ministries which is
expected to support stronger portfolio performance over time.
66.
Good Quality AAA was delivered in line with the CPS program. The AAA program was
small, but effective. The CEM/ICA provided background for the budget support operations and
enriched the dialogue with Government in the areas that the CEM covered: Investment Climate,
Adjusting to Free Trade; Education and Training; and, Social Protection. Its messages, further
streamlined in the Policy Notes, contributed to the dialogue with the new administration and
have favorably affected the sustainability of core aspects of the CPS. The Poverty Assessment
(draft) provides a much needed and valuable update to the trends in poverty incidence, and warns
of the need for continued vigilance as poverty incidence remains high in rural areas and amongst

the indigenous population. The Poverty Assessment based on the 2008 LSMS survey is
providing a valuable update of the main trends linked to the reduction of exclusion and
inequality, one of the core challenges in the country. The Environment Review was completed.
67.
The results framework highlighted the main areas of engagement, but focused mostly
on outputs more than on outcomes. Given the youth of the program, it is reasonable that a
considerable number of results centered on outputs and not on outcomes. But, the focus on
outcomes is needed to gauge accurately the effectiveness of the overall CPS package. For
instance, the CPS emphasized inclusion and broad-based growth, but monitoring system does not
permit a straightforward evaluation of impact, although the indications are of progress in the
right direction. In addition, some of the proposed results did not serve to fully gauge Bank
contribution. A specific example: For the first strategic objective, the CPS proposed as a result:
“Government uses updated poverty maps to update information in the management system used
to target the Red de Oportunidades conditional cash transfer program”, which does not fully
capture either the broader scope of the Bank’s engagement or the impact of the efforts.
68.
The Progress Report outlined accurately the response of the Bank to the crisis and, in
some cases, adjusted the results framework to more realistic expectations. The Progress Report
provided a thorough discussion of the milestones under the CPS. It also took stock of the
progress towards the proposed CPS results, adjusting targets to reflect progress.
69.
The CPS identified correctly risks in three areas: economic, political and portfolio
performance. The risks that the CPS identified were relevant but their nature changed during
implementation. The economic global crisis of 2008 and 2009 proved deeper and longer lasting
posing significant challenges for Panama given its high level of integration with the global
economy. Panama was well-positioned to weather the crisis because of the previous efforts at
fiscal strengthening, good macroeconomic management, a well regulated financial sector and
improved mechanisms to target assistance to the poor, all areas where the Bank program
contributed. Upon these solid bases the Government with the assistance of the Development
partners, the World Bank included, dealt dexterously with the crisis; the economic slow-down is
far less than in similar countries. The design of the CPS as a three-year program helped manage
the risk associated with shifts in development priorities across administrations. The project
cancellations that have taken place are a sign of the shift in priorities and approaches; in
situations such as these, cancelations are preferable than poor implementation later on. The more
substantive risk to sustainability of the core initiatives under this CPS has been managed through
dialogue, aided by the Policy Notes.
70.
The Completion Report rates Bank performance as satisfactory. Several considerations
justify the satisfactory rating. First, the Bank successfully reengaged in Panama by developing an
effective and trusting dialogue that has carried into the new administration. The combined design
of the ISN and the CPS proved effective. The ISN was prepared rapidly thus providing assistance
to the Government promptly while working in setting the basis for a long-term engagement. The
ISN contributed important background analytical work and fostered a productive dialogue. As a
result, by the time the CPS came into place the major initiatives that the program supported had
been launched, enhancing the relevance of the CPS efforts. Second, the Bank support to Panama
in response to the impact of the global crisis was timely and well targeted. It helped the country
77

contain the impact: Panama’s economy grew in 2009 contrary the majority of the LAC countries.
Particularly timely was the support provided by the budget support operation “Protecting the
Poor under Global Uncertainty” that focused on the financial sector and reducing the impact of
the crisis on the poor. Third, the Bank played a productive role as a knowledge institution given
that it assisted in the institutional design of the main Government initiatives under CPS support
(CCT, procurement, Fiscal Responsibility, training, etc.). The approach enhanced the view of the
Bank not only as a financial institution but a provider of knowledge products. Fourth, the Bank
worked effectively with other development partners, especially the IDB, as in the CCT program.
Lessons 
71.
The challenge for the CPS is to build on the foundations left in place by the successful
re-insertion of the World Bank in Panama after close to half a decade of limited presence. The
strategy to begin with an ISN and to emphasize AAA early-on contributed to a solid design of
the CPS and individual operations—especially the development policy lending. The ISN helped
the alignment of the CPS with Government strategy in areas of high ownership and where the
major initiatives had been launched. The following lessons are relevant to the design and
implementation of next CPS.
72.
Alignment with the political cycle can improve delivery of a CPS. Alignment with the
political cycle facilitates managing shifts in development priorities across governments, helping
reduce the number of approved projects with limited ownership. This strategy can be even more
effective if it is complemented with an up-front delivery of new operations so that their
implementation can take-off early-on, especially given the lags between approval and full
implementation. At the same time, the continuity of initiatives launched under the program can
be enhanced by the dissemination of results and continuous dialogue with a broad base of
country stakeholders to solidify a consensus on development strategy.
73.
Strategic use of synergies across different components of the program can help
improve the effectiveness of Bank support, especially when the relative financial contribution
of the program is small. The CPS succeeded in strengthening the delivery of results by building
synergies across various components of the program. For instance, the AAA provided solid
background for the dialogue and design of operations approved during the CPS period. The
technical assistance operations (public sector, social assistance, and health) contributed to the
design and measurement of the main program initiatives (CCT, procurement, etc.). The CCT
institutional set-up helped improve the targeting of other social assistance programs. The
effectiveness of the DPL profited from the quality and coverage of the AAA and the designs
under the technical assistance. The impact of the next CPS will be enhanced by continued
emphasis on assuring complementary across programs during design and implementation.
74.
Enhanced supervision improved portfolio performance and lessened the effect of weak
implementation capacity. During the CPS period portfolio implementation was affected by the
re-engagement process (youth of the portfolio, setting up implementation systems, etc.) and the
political transition. Intensive supervision helped to identify and address bottlenecks, including
those related to procurement procedures. In addition, close dialogue with the MEF reduced the
number of unexpected budget re-allocations and allowed for changes in project plans to
78

minimize adverse development impact. As a means to deepen development results, facilitate
implementation, and better gauge impact (both intended and unintended), project teams should
strengthen dialogue with project beneficiaries as well as authorities.
75.
Focus on results design, monitoring and evaluation enhances the development
dialogue and serves to gauge progress on development outcomes and Bank contribution to
results. While in some cases the results proposed under the previous CPS centered on
intermediate indicators, analytical work was available to track impact, such as the LSMS survey
that allowed assessment of the targeting accuracy of the CCT program. However, this may not
always be the case; therefore, it is important to assure the quality and comprehensiveness of the
result framework. As the program with Panama matures, it should be possible to focus CPS
results on development outcomes rather than on outputs. The results framework should
incorporate the major strategic concerns of the CPS, which includes consistency between the
results matrix and the priorities stated in the main text of the CPS document. In addition, it is
important to assure that the results framework is tractable and that it is traced regularly and used
in the dialogue with Government.
76.
In Panama, the World Bank Group can be very effective when it concentrates on the
delivery of a mix of lending, technical assistance, and knowledge products. The experience in
Panama shows that the Bank’s relevance is amplified when the delivery of lending operations is
supported by knowledge products. In turn, technical operations must continue to strengthen their
focus on the development of high quality designs that incorporate lessons from experiences in
other countries, as has been done in the CCT where Panama absorbed lessons from other
programs and went on to build one of the best targeted programs in the LAC region. In addition,
positive experiences in Panama, such as in public procurement, enrich the Bank’s knowledge
base in assisting other countries. A strong AAA program has also helped contribute to the
design of Development Policy Lending which has proven to be a useful instrument in Panama in
support of key government priorities.
