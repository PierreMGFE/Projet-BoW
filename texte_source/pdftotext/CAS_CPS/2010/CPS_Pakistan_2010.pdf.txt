COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FY 2010-2013
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
i.
During the previous CAS period strong growth and rapid poverty reduction through 2007 stalled
as the economy faced crisis in 2008. An ambitious reform program of the government elected in 2008
has reduced the fiscal and, in particular, the external current account deficit, increased GDP growth,
restored foreign exchange reserves, and reduced inflation. The reforms have also resulted in a significant
increase in power tariffs along with an automatic pass through of international fuel prices. The
government still has more work to do in a difficult security environment to further reduce inflation and
the fiscal deficit, particularly to eliminate the large losses of public sector entities in the power, transport
and manufacturing industries, and increase public revenues through the introduction of a value added tax
and better tax administration. The country's top leadership is cognizant of this and is committed to
continue spearheading reforms in these areas.
ii.
The Government’s strategy focuses on regaining macroeconomic stability after the economic
crisis and on structural reforms required to support the recovery of strong and sustainable growth. The
overall vision of PRSP-II is to steer Pakistan’s economic growth back to the range of 5-7 percent per year
by stimulating growth in the production sector; creating adequate employment opportunities; improving
income distribution; and harnessing the country’s economic competitiveness through economic
liberalization, deregulation and transparent privatization. The strategy recognizes that to steer Pakistan
back on a path of broad-based growth, create jobs, and reduce poverty, a prolonged period of
macroeconomic stability, financial discipline and sound policies is required.
iii.
Lessons Learned from the Previous CAS. The CPS reflects lessons learned from the Bank’s past
engagement in Pakistan. In particular, the need to adapt to a rapidly changing political and security
environment during implementation of the FY06-09 CAS highlights the need for flexibility. In addition,
the proposed CPS will focus more on the longstanding structural problems (like tax revenue mobilization
and power) that contributed to the rapid erosion in growth and stability during 2007 and 2008. Reflecting
the need for greater realism, the proposed CPS outlines a less ambitious priority IBRD/IDA lending
program while leaving open the possibility of doing more should conditions permit. Finally, given
Pakistan’s unique development and geopolitical challenges, enhanced partnership arrangements are
critical.
Bank Group Assistance Strategy
iv.
This CPS seeks to support Pakistan to address some of the major institutional, policy and
financing constraints on its capacity to achieve and sustain high economic growth rates, to manage
conflict and to improve the social indicators and capacity of its population. The World Bank Group’s
support to Pakistan will be organized around four pillars: (i) improving economic governance; (ii)
improving human development and social protection; (iii) improving infrastructure to support growth;
and (iv) improving security and reducing the risk of conflict.
v.
Improving Economic Governance. Addressing the shortcomings of Pakistan’s economic
management is critical not only for restoring macroeconomic stability but also for reducing the likelihood
of reversals leading to another cycle of growth giving way to stagnation. Enhancing domestic revenue
mobilization will be the urgent priority during the CPS period. Strengthening public expenditure
management at all levels of government will complement this focus. The strategy also focuses on
governance of markets with a view to strengthening Pakistan’s competitiveness by addressing barriers to
competition, and factor market rigidities (including constraints in access to finance). The World Bank
will support improvements in the legal and policy framework for growth through analytical work and

ii

policy-based lending. Through AAA and policy dialogue the Bank will support increased efficiency,
competition and broadening of financial markets as well as improvements in financial infrastructure. An
integral part of IFC’s strategy in Pakistan is to increase access to finance to underserved groups,
especially micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) by strengthening financial intermediation and
business management and corporate governance practices at enterprise level.
vi.
Improving Human Development and Social Protection. Improvement in human development,
including social protection, is critical to the goal of building resilience at the level of families and
individuals. The focus of Bank Group efforts will be to support increased spending on human
development along with reforms to improve governance and accountability in the provision of services
with the level of Bank closely tied to the achievement of agreed results under specific programs. There
will be enhanced attention to assessing and addressing the needs of vulnerable groups among the poor,
such as women and displaced people. In education, the CPS will support government programs that
combine supply side interventions and demand-side measures to improve access to education with a focus
on equity to address regional and gender imbalances. In social protection, the Bank will sustain its
partnership with the Government in establishing the Benazir Income Support Program (BISP) as the
country’s national safety net program with a focus on increasing its targeting efficiency and strengthening
its operation. IFC will continue to explore opportunities for investment in private health and education
sectors. Particular emphasis will be given to promoting public-private partnerships, wholesaling through
financial intermediaries, and technical and vocational education.
vii.
Improving Infrastructure to Support Growth. At present, power is the most pressing need in
infrastructure and the Bank Group will support adoption of policies to bring about financial sustainability,
expansion of generation in a least cost manner, and improvement in the efficiency of transmission and
distribution. A significant increase in IBRD lending is envisioned to support enhanced power generation.
IFC will support development of the power sector with a focus on supporting privatization of utility and
distribution companies, improving of utility efficiency and promoting energy efficiency, as well as
development of renewable power generation (hydro and wind generation). IFC will be a significant
investor in transport and logistics. In agriculture, the strategy envisions technical assistance to help
Pakistan in agricultural policy analysis and design with a view to increasing agricultural competitiveness
and expanding rural livelihoods. IFC will explore investment opportunities in agribusiness (including
warehousing and logistics), and support agribusiness SMEs through financial intermediaries.
viii.
Improving Security and Reducing the Risk of Conflict. The persistence of conflict in KP and
FATA poses a threat to some of the most vulnerable and marginalized populations in Pakistan, while also
challenging economic stability across the country. The absence of employment opportunities and
inadequate livelihoods in FATA and KP has created a favorable environment for militant groups whose
economic incentives for potential recruits greatly outweigh available opportunities while political and
governance deficits, including weaknesses in the justice system, perpetuate a historical experience of
disenfranchisement, alienation, corruption, poverty and underdevelopment that have fuelled the crisis.
Bank support will be guided by the results of a Post Crisis Needs Assessment (PCNA) which is now
underway. This is a highly complex area, and the Bank’s knowledge is evolving but limited. We will,
however, make this a major thrust of our work. Support under the CPS may include support for
agricultural/livestock-linked employment and livelihoods, expansion of general and technical/vocational
education, investment in energy and transport, and social protection. In addition, the strengthening of
local government will also be a focus to enhance the legitimacy of the state and counter the claim to
legitimacy by militant groups as a viable alternative to the state.
Implementing the Strategy
ix.
Recognizing the challenges and uncertainties facing Pakistan in the coming few years, the
strategy emphasizes a more focused prioritization on key outcomes with flexibility to enable the Bank

iii

Group to meet emerging challenges and opportunities. Hence within the overall strategic framework
outlined above, the strategy will prioritize Bank support as follows: First, the CPS gives special focus to
the achievement of those outcomes that have the potential to be truly transformational. These outcomes
are deemed to be pivotal to the sustained achievement of most of the rest of PRSP-II objectives and CPS
outcomes and will be the areas where the Bank Group will concentrate much of its efforts. Pakistan
cannot effectively build the foundation to make headway on exploiting its strategic advantages and
endowments in the medium to long-term without successfully addressing these very basic issues. These
objectives are by no means easy – indeed, many of them represent longstanding challenges where
progress has been incremental, at best. In these areas the CPS envisions a full range of services including
AAA, IBRD/IDA financing and, where appropriate, MDTF resources for the conflict affected region.
These transformational outcomes are:
•

Strengthening Tax Policy and Administration: raising the ratio of tax to GDP (currently only
10.2 percent of GDP) is absolutely essential if Pakistan is to have the resources to invest in
human development and infrastructure, and if it is to build resilience to future shocks and guard
against costly and disruptive growth reversals.

•

Expanding Power Provision: reforming the power sector and ensuring sustainable expansion of
supplies is absolutely essential if industrial and service activity is to be increased and productivity
raised.

•

Addressing Security: coping with the consequence of conflict while reducing the prospects of
future conflict is essential for long term growth. This is a highly complex area, and the Bank’s
competence and knowledge is evolving but limited. We will, however, make this a major thrust
of our work, giving emphasis to service provision and job creation in highly vulnerable areas,
(and drawing upon emerging findings from the WDR and from work in Pakistan).

x.
Second, in addition to these transformational priorities, the strategy identifies a core program of
support to improve educational and health outcomes, strengthen the potential for increased and more
productive labor force participation, reinforce safety net systems and enhance the earning capacity of the
poor and vulnerable. These objectives relate directly to key elements of the MDGs and related social
outcomes and indicators. The core program also includes selected investments in ports, water
management and financial management.
xi.
These two areas comprise the priority lending program to be financed during the CPS. Finally,
the CPS envisages the potential for the program to expand beyond this priority program to address key
challenges which do not meet all of the selectivity criteria but where the Bank would like to support the
government to lay the basis for interventions to successfully address significant development challenges.
Such challenges include fostering livability and economic growth and dynamism within Pakistan’s major
cities and rapidly growing urban settlements, and strengthening fiscal management in Pakistan’s
provinces. The CPS will support such activities where the individual programs are ready and the
prospects for success and results are strong. We will also link expansion of the overall lending program
beyond the priority program to progress being made against the objectives of the transformational
activities. The above approach to engagement with Government under the CPS emphasizes exercising
selectivity in what we can firmly undertake to do effectively while not foregoing the option to do more, if
conditions permit. It should allow for more effective use of our resources under the uncertain conditions
we expect to continue to face in Pakistan.
xii.
In line with the need for selectivity, the proposed CPS also identifies subsectors and thematic
areas where the Bank will not lend. In the energy sector, given our limited resources and capacity, the
Bank will not engage in coal. On governance, the Bank will play only a supporting role with partners

iv

leading in the areas of civil service and judicial reforms. In agriculture, the strategy envisages providing
analytical support to formulate strategies and policies to increase value-added in the sector. We may
extend this role to supporting the government to develop program platforms that may serve as vehicles for
other development partners to provide financing to the sector, subject to demand from government and
partners. Finally there are sectors, like highways, where risks are such that the Bank Group will not
engage pending significant improvement in institutional governance or strong measures being taken by
Government to mitigate risks, including fraud and corruption risks.
xiii.
The priority lending program amounts to an estimated $3.7 billion (IBRD/IDA) through FY12,
equivalent to about 60 percent of a total potential lending envelope of up to $6.0 billion during the 4 year
CPS period (FY10-13). IFC intends to invest between $1.3 and $1.5 billion provided that the economic
and security situations do not deteriorate significantly, and will continue with its robust program of
Advisory activities. The Bank on behalf of development partners will administer complementary grant
financing of at least $100 million for the MDTF for the Northwest Border Region. This amount may
increase depending on developments in the region and results achieved.
Risks and Mitigation
xiv.
Given the serious and multifaceted challenges that Pakistan faces, this CPS poses greater than
normal risks. The FY10-13 CPS will be implemented in the context of economic austerity with the
potential for policy reversal as well as other uncertainties. Notably, although Pakistan has made much
progress in stabilizing the economy, reviving growth of GDP, exports and foreign exchange reserves and
reducing inflation and the current account deficit, the fiscal situation remains vulnerable and inflation
high and hence there is a risk of macroeconomic slippage. In addition, ongoing conflict within Pakistan
and in Afghanistan poses a risk to stability while proposed Bank Group activities in the conflict-affected
northwest greatly increase the Bank’s exposure to such risks. Finally, there are implementation risks
which impact the Bank Group’s program. The Bank Group will seek to mitigate these risks through proactive measures to reduce exposure of staff to security risks and through alternative means of supervision
along with continued attention to capacity building and robust fiduciary arrangements such as those
involving third-party monitoring. By design, the Bank program is largely structured to be dependent on
results, with disbursements for a significant part of priority program and commitments against the
contingent part of the overall program firmly dependent on program and results achieved during
implementation.

PAKISTAN
COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FY 2010-2013
I.

INTRODUCTION

1.
Pakistan has extraordinarily important strategic endowments and great development potential.
Three endowments, all of which can help propel growth and poverty reduction, stand out. First, Pakistan
occupies a strategic location at the crossroads of South Asia, Central Asia, China and the Middle East. It
is at the fulcrum of a huge market with a vast population, enormous and diverse resources and huge
untapped potential for trade -- and a huge potential source of demand and growth for Pakistan. Second,
Pakistan has a huge population; the sixth most populous country in the world and the most urbanized in
South Asia. Pakistan has undergone a major demographic transition over the last 40 years, exemplified
by high fertility rates from 1960 to the mid-1980s, a progressive decline in the fertility rates thereafter and
an overall decline in the ratio of the dependent age population to the working age population from 90
percent in the early 1960s to about 68 percent today. The increasing proportion of Pakistan’s population
that is of working age provides Pakistan with a potential demographic dividend, namely, the potential for
increased economic growth as a result of increasing and productive participation of the population in the
labor force. Third, Pakistan has one of the most extensive irrigation networks in the world. The
country’s irrigation assets have underpinned food security in a country that ranks amongst the world’s
most arid and provide the basis for rapid potential growth in agricultural income and employment.
2.
Pakistan has seen episodes of high economic growth rates when it appeared that this development
potential would be realized. But growth episodes have typically been hobbled by unsustainable macro
imbalances reflecting low domestic revenue mobilization and public savings. Pakistan has been plagued
by cycles of high growth interrupted by shocks and crises and followed by relative stagnation. Similarly,
while Pakistan has made great strides in service delivery over the last three decades, it has not been able
to translate an increasing working age population into a strong and sustained impetus for growth. Social
indicators for both health and education have remained low and have lagged seriously behind other
countries in the region. The level of expenditure on education and health has been severely constrained
by limited fiscal space and the weight of other spending priorities. Finally, Pakistan’s strategic location
has also brought its own set of challenges in the form of overlapping religious and national identities,
contested geographical boundaries and sharply contrasting ideological orientations – factors which have
sometimes contributed to generating conflicts that have deeply affected Pakistan and the expenditure
priorities of the Pakistan state.
3.
To make headway in realizing its development potential, Pakistan must overcome the obstacles to
its ability to sustain high economic growth rates, to manage conflict and to improve the social indicators
and capacity of its population. This CPS seeks to support Pakistan to address some of the major
institutional, policy and financing constraints on its capacity to do so. However, many of the constraints
that Pakistan face relate to the nature of its political institutions, the political economy environment and
the consequential scope for action by policy makers. Part of the challenge for the Bank in this CPS is to
recognize the limits of the effectiveness of its support given the impact of these political economy factors
and, as a consequence, the need to be very selective in where and how it provides support.
4.
The previous World Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy for Pakistan is instructive in this
regard. The CAS covered the period from FY06 to FY09. The CAS was prepared during a period of
relative political stability and optimism about the country’s prospects for growth and poverty reduction.
Both stability and optimism proved short-lived. Political stability started to unravel in mid-2007, two
years into the implementation of the CAS at the same time as the Pakistan economy was buffeted by
external shocks. The resolve to take adjustment measures weakened, the rate of economic growth stalled
and decelerated, Pakistan went into a severe macroeconomic crisis and security conditions started to

2

deteriorate markedly both in the western border regions and in major urban centers. In the process,
original plans in the CAS were substantially unfulfilled.
II.

COUNTRY CONTEXT
A.

Political Developments

5.
Reflecting geopolitical and financial pressures after independence, consolidation of the state and
its capacity took precedence over the broadening of political participation and the sharing of power and
authority. A parliamentary and participatory political system took root only slowly, with the first
nationwide general elections held only in 1970. Until then, effective power and authority lay initially
with unelected members of the executive and subsequently with a succession of military rulers. During
this period, a pattern of early dismissal or dissolution of elected officials and provincial assemblies by the
executive took hold. In the 38 years between 1970 and 2008, Pakistan was under effective military rule
for a total period of 20 years. Six civilian governments were elected to office for the remainder of the
period; none completed its term before being dismissed or overthrown from office.
6.
But Pakistan has been undergoing remarkable political and constitutional changes over the last
two years. Civil society and the judiciary have been playing a more active and independent role; free and
fair elections were held and vigorously contested by largely unfettered political parties with competing
manifestos of the nature and scope of public goods and services to be provided by the state; military
leadership has stayed on the sidelines, focusing primarily on security challenges (see below); political
competition continues to be vigorous but political accommodation has expanded. There is optimism
about the prospects for political stability and for increased accountability by the state for the scope and
quality of public goods and services provided to citizens. One outgrowth of this political climate has been
the recent major changes in the division of revenues between the federal and provincial governments.
With these changes, more resources will now go to the provincial governments who hold the mandate for
delivery of most basic services. Similarly, the role of provincial governments in delivery of social and
economic services has been enhanced through the Eighteenth Constitutional Amendment. Also,
experience during the last two years suggests that an elected government with broad legitimacy can
command the political support needed to take politically difficult policy measures (as in energy pricing
and public expenditures) that improve the prospects for better economic and social outcomes. In many
respects, therefore, recent political developments present a window of opportunity for reforms especially
in service delivery and in some areas that require strong political legitimacy to pursue changes that
adversely affect popular or vested interests.
7.
Security conditions within Pakistan started to deteriorate progressively from 2001 with the
political and military spillover of the war in Afghanistan. Early government efforts to drive out foreign
fighters and their allies from their refuges in the tribal areas met considerable and violent resistance and
resulted mostly in stalemate. At the same time, events abroad like the war in Iraq and domestic political
conditions created opportunities for active mobilization of support by various Taliban factions in the
Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (KP). 1 As its support and
presence increased, the Taliban role shifted in many areas to direct attempts at challenging the writ of the
state and supplanting its role at the local level. Starting in 2007, Taliban factions in FATA and KP
coalesced under the unified banner of the Tehrik-e-Taliban-e-Pakistan (TTP). Subsequently, the TTP
seized control of large swaths of FATA and the tribal regions of KP, and began to present a major
security challenge to the Government of Pakistan. Overall, fatalities in terrorism-related violence
increased from about 200 in 2003 to above 6,000 in 2008. The deployment of suicide attacks and the
high rate of increase in fatalities have significantly raised the perception of insecurity in Pakistan,
especially in the key urban areas.

in April 2010.

8.
In mid-2009, government, with the active support of parliament, launched a concerted military
effort to reverse the erosion of the writ of the state in major areas in KP and FATA, starting with the Swat
Valley in the Malakand Division. The Swat Valley held symbolic importance as the first area in Pakistan,
outside FATA, where militants had taken effective control. The full-scale military operations have so far
led to the successful displacement of militants in the targeted areas. But they also resulted in about three
million internally displaced persons. Taking care of IDPs as well as reconstructing the conflict-damaged
areas will impose a major additional fiscal burden on Pakistan in the short run. But the reassertion of
state control also represents an important opportunity for the government to take measures to ensure
durable peace and development in these critical border areas in the future.

deficit, and signs of overheating were evident. The
sharp rise in international oil and food prices,
combined with policy inaction and internal political turmoil, rapidly expanded macroeconomic
imbalances in Pakistan in 2007/08. In the absence of adequate measures to address the imbalances—in
particular, not passing on international price increases to domestic consumers while covering price
increases through rising subsidies—the economy slid into a crisis. The onset of the global financial crisis
further aggravated the situation.
11.
By mid-October 2008 the foreign exchange reserves of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) had
dropped to about three weeks of imports, the nominal exchange rate had depreciated significantly,
monetization of government debt was in full swing with a rapid rise in inflation, and spreads on Pakistani
sovereign bonds had climbed above 2,000 basis points. In response, in November 2008, to avoid a
default on foreign debt payments, the authorities developed a homegrown stabilization program,

4

supported by the IMF through a Stand-By Arrangement (SBA). The stabilization program envisaged
fiscal and monetary tightening to bring down inflation and reduce the external current account deficit to
sustainable levels.
Towards Stabilization
12.
The ambitious reform program of the government has brought about a significant reduction in the
fiscal and current account deficits and restored foreign exchange reserves while GDP growth has started
to pick up. Foreign remittances have grown thanks to the government’s remittance drive. Increases in
power tariffs totaling 80 percent since February 2008 along with an automatic pass-through of fuel prices
have helped to address the fiscal deficit. Inflation has fallen from over 20 percent in 2008 to about 13
percent. The government has more work to do in a difficult security environment to further reduce
inflation and the fiscal deficit, in particular by eliminating large losses of public sector entities in the
power, transport and manufacturing industries and by increasing public revenues through the introduction
of the value added tax and better tax administration.

Economic activity has slowed significantly in the past year-and-a-half due to reduced domestic
and global demand, but is now showing some signs of picking up. Real economic growth declined to 2
percent in 2008/09, compared to an average annual growth of 6.6 percent in the preceding five years, but
is projected to rebound to 3 percent during 2009/10. In terms of the sectoral composition of growth, the
services sector, which accounts for more than half of GDP, has continued to grow, the large-scale
manufacturing (LSM) production index has shown modest positive growth during the first seven months
of 2009/10 while agricultural sector growth has been weaker than projected and prospects for the sector
remain weak in 2009/10. Overall growth has been driven by private consumption in the past year (see
Figure 2). The share of public and private investment in GDP rapidly contracted in 2008/09, which does
not augur well for the future productive capacity of the economy and medium-term growth prospects.

vigorous Government efforts at promoting increased remittances.
15.
Other financial inflows (foreign direct and portfolio investment and debt) have dropped sharply
owing to macroeconomic instability, security perceptions and concerns and global recession. Net capital
inflows have remained on a decreasing trend during 2009/10: in the first eight months FDI declined to
US$1.3 billion compared to US$2.8 billion in the same period in 2008/09; and portfolio investment
remained negative. Despite these developments, foreign exchange reserves of the State Bank of Pakistan
rebounded to about US$11 billion (equivalent to

target is subject to significant risk. The fiscal
deficit during the first half of 2009/10 was already
2.7 percent of GDP, and seasonality implied a higher fiscal deficit in the second half of the fiscal year.
To stay within the target, the authorities have decided to cut federal development spending by 30 percent.
However, other spending pressures are also emerging: electricity subsidies are projected to substantially
overrun targets, and spending on security is expected to increase owing to ongoing conflict.

required to meet the annual target. With the exception of sales tax, all taxes performed inadequately visà-vis the annual target, so there is potential sizeable downside risk to revenue projections.
18.
After a delay of over two years, the federal and provincial governments agreed on a new
(seventh) National Finance Commission (NFC) Award on December 30, 2009, which provides for
significant changes in inter-governmental revenue sharing from July 1, 2010 onwards. The new award
has raised the share of provinces in the divisible pool of federally collected taxes from 46.25 percent to 56
percent. However, the new revenue sharing arrangement will be sustainable only if substantially
increased revenue is mobilized and/or if it is accompanied by a transfer of expenditure responsibility from
the federal to provincial governments. As a result of the recent amendment of the Constitution, further
functional responsibilities will be devolved to provinces.
19.
Since November 2008, the Government has met its financing needs mainly through non-bank
borrowing. The increase in T-bill placements has enabled the Government to reduce the level of
monetization.
20.
Total government debt (including obligations to the IMF) as a share of GDP is projected to rise
from 59.3 percent in 2008/09 to 62.4 percent in 2009/10. About half of the debt is external and half
domestic. Total debt is projected to remain over 60 percent of GDP in the medium term, but thereafter
decline. The external debt-to-exports ratio rose to 220 percent in 2008/09, is projected to peak at 273
percent in 2011/12 and start thereafter gradually declining. However, debt sustainability analysis
suggests that external debt service remains manageable although there are potential risks to this
assessment from sources such as lower than projected growth and foreign direct investment (FDI), and
higher than projected current account deficit, interest rates and exchange rate depreciation.
21.
Credit to the private sector fell dramatically after the onset of the crisis as economic activity
slowed, but is showing signs of recovery. Thanks to large government borrowing to finance budgetary
needs, and a surge in credit demand by public sector enterprises, banks have been able to avoid lending to
the relatively risky private sector as non-performing loans (NPL) increased. 2 Non-performing loans
increased from 8.4 percent in September 2008 to 12.4 percent in September 2009. Although the
accumulation of NPLs has slowed down since March 2009, the overall level is still rising. NPLs are
generally adequately provisioned for. Banks, other than a few small ones, remain profitable and generally
well capitalized. The exceptions are expected to be handled through mergers and fresh capital injections.
Stress tests performed by SBP indicate that the large and medium sized banks are relatively robust,
though some medium sized banks are vulnerable to crisis scenarios.

2

During the first nine months of 2009/10, the credit demand for government budgetary operations and public sector
enterprises stood at Rs 404 billion, more than three times the size of credit demand in the private sector.

As a result of reduced aggregate demand
and international commodity and oil prices,
inflation has declined, but remains a concern.
Inflationary pressures, which had eased after the
second half of 2008/09, have resurfaced since
October 2009 (Figure 6). This is partly due to
the base effect, but partly also reflects increased
food prices and upward adjustments in energy
prices. The core inflation, which indicates the
persistence of inflationary pressures, has also
been rising since December 2009. The average
inflation target of 11 percent for 2009/10 is likely
to be somewhat exceeded.
Medium-Term Outlook

23.
While the economy is stabilizing, continued improvement in the macroeconomic situation will
remain a challenge. Global economic recovery has started, but remains fragile and slow. Global trade is
projected to remain depressed and unemployment high for years in a large part of the world. Pakistan can
expect little in the way of a substantial growth impetus from global markets. Pakistan’s future economic
prospects will hinge on good economic policies and management.
24.
According to the government’s medium-term macroeconomic framework, which is supported by
the IMF’s Stand-By Arrangement, Pakistan’s real GDP growth is projected to start recovering slowly at 3
percent in 2009/10, and increase gradually to 5 percent by 2012/13 (Table 3). However, longer-term
projections are particularly uncertain in view of the volatile global and domestic economic environment.

The external current account deficit is projected to widen again to 4 percent of GDP in 2010/11 as
imports pick up before declining slowly. Remittances are projected to grow by 7 percent in 2009/10, and
continue to grow at 6.5 percent thereafter with the help of government’s remittance drive. Foreign
exchange reserves are expected to build up from US$14.7 billion at end-June 2010 to about US$18.4
billion by end-June 2011/12 with the import coverage projected to fall from 4.9 months in 2010/11 to 3.6
in 2013/14. However, these projections also are subject to substantial risk, since the resumption of
foreign inflows is uncertain.
26.
Pakistan’s medium-term outlook hinges on a significant increase in tax revenues: by 2-3
percentage points of GDP by 2012/13. To meet this target, the authorities have committed to
comprehensive reforms of tax policy and administration. This includes quick implementation of a broadbased value-added taxation (VAT) of goods and services, which the authorities plan to roll-out in October
2010. However, the process is somewhat complicated as the Constitution assigns taxation of services to
the provinces. Hence, separate provincial and federal VAT laws have been submitted to the respective
parliaments, and are likely to be approved after the federal and provincial governments agree on
implementation modalities of the tax.3 Failure to raise revenues as planned would further heighten
Pakistan’s vulnerability to shocks, and jeopardize development efforts, and deepen the country’s reliance
on foreign aid. If revenues are raised as planned, total expenditures could be maintained at the current
level as a share of GDP over the medium term. In addition, if subsidies (in particular on power) were
significantly reduced, there would be space for a steady increase in development spending. Otherwise,
expenditure plans would need to be revisited.
C.

Poverty Trends and Vulnerability

27.
Poverty trends: As a result of
economic and political turbulence, poverty
has also been volatile in Pakistan. Pakistan
saw an impressive decline in poverty during
2001/02-2007/08: the share of the
population living in poverty halved, down
from 34.5 percent in 2001/02 to 17.2
percent in 2007/08 (Table 4). Both urban
and rural areas saw significant reductions.
This progress was made possible by growth
in real per adult consumption expenditures
and declining inequality during 2005/062007/08 (Table 5).
Key human
development indicators of educational
attainment,
health
outcomes,
and
unemployment rates corroborate these trends
through 2007/08.

28.
The pace of poverty reduction varied across provinces (Figure 7). Poverty in Punjab and KP
steadily reduced from 1998/99 onwards, while in Sindh and Balochistan it recorded sharp rises in 2001/02
and 2005/06, possibly owing to weak agricultural performance in those years. The reduction in poverty in
KP is particularly noteworthy, and high level of remittances, both foreign and domestic, seem to have
facilitated that.

The introduction of VAT has been delayed by three months to allow the federal and provincial governments to
reach an agreement on implementation modalities of VAT. The tax is now expected to be introduced from October
1, 2010.

Pakistan’s population is vulnerable, living close to the poverty line, and could fall into poverty as a result
of shocks. See Box 1 for a discussion on characteristics of the poor and vulnerable in Pakistan.
Box 1: Who are Vulnerable in Pakistan?
Who are vulnerable? The overlap between vulnerable and poor households is low: about 60 percent of the highly
vulnerable population does not belong to the poorest 20 percent. This means that a significant share of the non-poor
population is as vulnerable as poor households (Figure 8). Vulnerable households are characterized by their limited
asset ownership (such as land holding and livestock) and a large household size. They also invest little in children’s
education and health (Figure 9), which leads to poverty traps, if left unaddressed.

In fact, the analysis of the poverty impact of recent economic shocks suggests that the recent
gains in poverty reduction may have been partly reversed in the wake of recent economic crises. Food
and fuel prices rose by 23.7 and 18.4 percent, respectively, between 2007/08 and 2008/09, resulting in a
21 percent reduction in purchasing power. The 2007/08 household survey results indeed suggest that
poverty started rising towards the end of that fiscal year. However, the impact of the recent economic
downturn on poverty will only be known when the next household survey has been conducted and results
analyzed.
D.

Progress in Human Development, Gender, MDGs

31.
Pakistan’s social indicators have consistently failed to match its economic progress. While
human development indicators have improved since 2001/02, they still lag well behind other low income
countries at a similar level of income (Table 6), heightening the vulnerability of the population.

Education: Access to education remains a
significant challenge. Net enrolment rates in primary
education have increased over the past decade (Figure
10), but access remains far from universal, and there
are significant regional, rural-urban, and gender
disparities. Compared to the average in South Asia and
other low-income countries, Pakistan is lagging behind
in female enrolment at the primary school level.
Access issues are even larger at higher levels of
education. Tertiary enrollment rates are estimated at
about 4 percent of the eligible age cohort (17-23), and
less than 8 percent of the workforce has received
formal training.

Health: Select health indicators—such
as full immunization rates and prevalence of

(Figure 11). However, progress in improving
child, infant and maternal mortality as well as
the provision of reproductive health services has
been slow. Under-five mortality and fertility
rates remain the highest among South Asian
countries. Chronic child malnutrition is about
40 percent, and high levels of out-of-pocket
expenditures for health services hamper access
of the poor to basic services. Significant gender
and rural/urban disparities persist.

status of women is worse than that of men, and
adversely affected by lack of mobility and
information as well as social norms. These factors have an adverse impact also on family planning
programs and fertility, and thus enhancing female education would be particularly important. Female
labor force participation rate, though increased among highly-skilled women, remains low at 21.5 percent,
and the share of women at managerial positions at two percent.
36.
However, at the same time, girl’s age at marriage has gone up and women’s political
representation has increased as a result of reservation of seats for women in local bodies and Parliament.
Elevation of women to key positions in the media has also brought gender issues to the public discourse.
The latest household survey results also indicate that women, even the poorest ones, are increasingly
aware of the importance of family planning and there is a large unmet demand for family planning
services.
37.
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs): Pakistan is unlikely to meet the MDGs (see Annex
B1). While the country was on track to meet the poverty reduction goal, the recent economic crisis and
its adverse impact on poverty may have jeopardized its achievement.
III.

KEY DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES AND GOVERNMENT’S POVERTY
REDUCTION STRATEGY
A.

Key Development Challenges

38.
The analysis of Pakistan’s recent development performance points to a number of critical
challenges to meet going forward.
39.
Weak revenue mobilization is the central challenge for addressing Pakistan’s tight fiscal
constraints. Pakistan’s tax collection has failed to improve since the late 1990s, and is among the lowest
in the world. The tax-to-GDP ratio recovered to 10.9 percent in 2006/07 but, due to the economic crisis,
dropped to 10.2 percent in 2008/09. Problems in tax collection are related to administrative limitations
and weaknesses in tax policy that have been unduly responsive to the needs of vested interests. Tax
evasion is rampant and there is a vast network of special treatments and exemptions backed up by
powerful vested interests. Nonetheless, progress has been made in improving the structure on energy
taxes by converting the petroleum surcharge, the yield of which was impacted by developments in
international markets and domestic political considerations, into a fixed petroleum levy. Also there has

12

been some progress in implementing reforms in the Federal Bureau of Revenue, although these have yet
to result in increased tax revenue. Piecemeal changes in tax legislation have eroded the coherence of the
tax structure with numerous preferences favoring certain sectors and economic activities over others.
Finally, there are serious questions of equity: in a nation of about 160 million people, only 1.8 million file
for income tax, and of about 17,000 enterprises, only 4,000 declare taxable income.
40.
Improving the level, composition and efficiency of public expenditure is critical to achieving
Pakistan’s development objectives. While the lack of fiscal space (Table 7)—arising mainly from a low
tax collection—severely constrains spending on core government functions, a large share of scarce
resources is channeled into uses with limited economic or social returns. As a result compared to other
countries, Pakistan spends relatively less on almost all key sectors of the economy. For example,
expenditure on roads, energy, health and education account for only 14 percent of total spending in
Pakistan, compared to the global average of twice that level. Improving the effectiveness of spending not
only through better allocation of resources and a more careful choice of priorities but also through better
implementation, more efficient delivery of services and plugging of leakages and waste is a key
challenge. This will require increasing the capability and authority of public institutions, especially those
concerned with economic and financial management and the delivery of public services.

41.
Shortages of reliable infrastructure represent a key constraint to sustained growth.
Availability of electricity is currently considered to be the main constraint to economic activity. The
sector faces a large gap between supply and demand leading to widespread load shedding and forcing
many firms to invest in captive supply. One in every six firms identifies power as a major or severe
obstacle to business while only 65 percent of households have access to electricity. Governance
constraints are a key contributor to these outcomes and include (i) widespread theft of electricity amid
weak enforcement and administrative systems to deter and punish such acts; (ii) weak corporate
governance, pressure and accountability for performance by management in the sector: and (iii)
investment decision-making marred by widespread perceptions of corruption. Beyond the power sector,
the transportation network is aging and inefficient, imposing estimated costs of 4-6 percent of GDP on the
economy and expected to face huge challenges in adapting to prospective shifts in demand if agricultural
growth and diversification takes root. Inadequate and poorly managed urban infrastructure also
represents a critical constraint to expansion of key growth centers and livability in the country’s most
rapidly growing population centers. Overall, Pakistan has immense investment and institutional reform
needs in order to build an infrastructure platform capable of both sustaining and adapting to growth.
42.
Conflict and insecurity represent major obstacles to economic development and poverty
reduction and therefore dealing with the causes and consequences of conflict represents a critical
challenge. The security situation in Pakistan is precarious, having deteriorated over the past four years,
and imposes a large cost to society. The Government and donors recognize that the crisis has deep
historical roots as well as links to the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan. The Federally Administered Tribal
Areas—a focus of ongoing military operations—has long been administered under a colonial-era legal
and governance framework based on tribal structures that leaves it outside of the regular constitutional
framework. A patronage tradition has grown and fueled grievances that have been exploited by insurgent
forces. Inadequate justice and the rule of law, critical components of the provision of public goods, are
seen as integral dimensions of the crisis in FATA and KP. The ascendancy of militancy in Swat, for
example, was directly linked to perceived degradation in the responsiveness of the justice system.
43.
Addressing longstanding economic deprivation and social inequities among the population in the
northwest frontier region is critical to dealing with conflict. FATA consistently ranks lowest in Pakistan
across key sets of human development indicators, and KP follows not far behind. The region also hosts
among the largest demographic segments of young men between the ages of 15 and 29 years while
offering little in the way of employment and livelihood opportunities. Young men are particularly
vulnerable to the economic incentives provided by militant groups. The widely reported monthly stipend
for a ground-level recruit is between Rs. 15,000 and 20,000 (US$188 to US$251) far more than the Rs.
6,210 ($77) a month for a rare, well-paying unskilled job. Unemployment among young men ages 15 to
24 stands at 10.5 percent in KP (numbers are dramatically higher in tribal areas than in settled districts).
In contrast, unemployment in Sindh province for the same demographic is at 4.1percent, and for the
country as a whole the figure rests at 7.1percent. The adverse impacts of these disparities, in terms of
their contribution to the nurturing of grievances and to militancy and insecurity, are increasingly felt
beyond the northwest frontier region.
44.
Providing employment for a young, growing and increasingly urbanized population is a major
challenge for Pakistan. Approximately 29 percent of the 161 million population of Pakistan is in the age
group of 15 to 24, and this is projected to increase by another 10 percent by 2020. 4 Exports of
manufactured, labor intensive goods are one of Pakistan’s main windows to income and employment
generation for this work force, and thus for poverty reduction. However, the focus of industrial policy has
remained on promoting import substitution and subsidizing exporting firms rather than improving
productivity through competition and on developing competitive manufacturing export sector. Pakistan’s
share of world trade remains small at less than 1 percent and the share of trade in the economy has
4

National Institute of Population Studies (NIPS), Government of Pakistan, November 2006.

14

declined in the last few years to less than 31 percent of GDP in FY2009. Product diversification of
exports remains limited; textiles and garments account for 70 percent and ten other sectors for 22.5
percent of total exports. Thirty-two individual products, more than half of which are in the textiles and
garments sectors, are the principal export drivers.
45.
Modest progress was made during the previous CAS period but Pakistan’s human development
indicators continue to lag behind those of the region. At all levels, participation rates remain the lowest
in the South Asia region. Progress has been more encouraging in increasing education enrolments, but
quality and retention rates (especially for girls) remain a concern. In addition, there is slow progress in
improving health outcomes including child, infant and maternal mortality, and in enhancing the provision
of reproductive health services. Under-five mortality remains the highest among the large South Asian
countries as does the fertility rate (Pakistan’s Total Fertility Rate (TFR) is 4.1 compared to 2.9 in India
and Bangladesh). Chronic child malnutrition is very high at around 40percent. Significant gender and
rural/urban disparities persist. And the MDGs are unlikely to be met.
46.
These poor human development outcomes are a function of both inadequate investment and
ineffective use of available resources. Public expenditure on health and education remain low by
international standards while weaknesses in public service delivery limit the effectiveness of spending.
Recent health facility surveys in Baluchistan and Sindh indicate that many health workers are not
showing up regularly to work. In Balochistan, the absentee rate for all staff was 50 percent, while for
doctors it was 58 percent and for female paramedics, 63 percent. The available evaluation evidence
indicates that the efficiency of public expenditure in education is relatively low and learning outcomes in
the state sector fall well short of that in the private sector.
47.
In parallel, to protect the poor during economic adjustment, government’s social safety net
system needs strengthening. Even though Pakistan has had a myriad of safety net programs targeted
primarily at the chronic poor, ranging from (unconditional) cash transfers to social care services and
microfinance programs, they have had little impact on poverty and vulnerability. Programs have been
fragmented and often duplicative, with limited coverage and poor targeting. To strengthen the safety net
systems and increase coverage, the government launched the Benazir Income Support Program (BISP) in
September 2008, with the objective of providing cash grants to the poorest families in the country
identified on the basis of a robust targeting methodology. The program intends to cover the 5 million
poorest families in 2009/10, and expand the coverage to 7 million families in 2010/11, prospectively
covering close to 25 percent of the population. As such, BISP is by far the largest social safety net
program in Pakistan and could become the core safety net in the country.
48.
Ultimately, governance challenges lie at the heart of most of Pakistan’s economic development
priorities. The achievement of Pakistan’s development objectives depends on improved governance of
the public sector – greater transparency and accountability, strengthened legal and regulatory frameworks
especially for private sector activity, improved responsiveness, and a better interface with citizens.
Improvements in the delivery of education, gains in the coverage of social protection programs and
increased access to health care all require that the state performs its functions more effectively and
efficiently at federal and at provincial levels. Similarly, overcoming some of the binding constraints to
economic growth such as infrastructure constraints depends in large part on Pakistan’s ability to
effectively plan, prioritize and execute policy. These constraints have become more profound as the
country has faced a range of economic and security shocks. There is no shortage of good policies, laws
and regulations in Pakistan but, owing to institutional weaknesses, the implementation of these policies
and enforcement of laws has often been weak. As a result, consistent and sustained implementation of
economic policies and reforms has eluded Pakistan.
49.
A range of survey evidence confirms Pakistan’s governance challenges. The Worldwide
Governance Indicators suggest that Pakistan is at or below the 25th percentile on key dimensions of

15

governance, and significantly below the South Asia averages with the exception of regulatory quality. A
recent Investment Climate Survey indicates that governance constraints are critical to the overall business
environment. Despite improvements in the business—governance interface, firms’ perception of
corruption and crime have worsened; between 2002 and 2007, the percent of firms citing corruption as a
major constraint to doing business rose from 40 to 57 percent. Overall, almost half of all Pakistani firms
reported at least one incident of bribery.

Government’s Poverty Reduction Strategy

50.
PRSP-II:
The
current
administration finalized the second
PRSP (PRSP-II) in January 2009.
PRSP-II reflects the Nine Point Plan of
the Prime Minister and is fully aligned
with the MDGs and covers fiscal years
2008/09-2010/11.
It focuses on
regaining macroeconomic stability after
the economic crisis and on structural
reforms required to support the
recovery of strong and sustainable
growth. The overall vision of PRSP-II
is to steer Pakistan’s economic growth
back in the range of 5-7 percent per
annum by stimulating growth prospects
in the production sector; creating
adequate employment opportunities;
improving income distribution; and
harnessing the country’s economic
competitiveness through economic
liberalization,
deregulation
and
transparent privatization. The strategy
envisions an economy with competitive
enterprises, productive employment
opportunities, transparent governance
and low poverty.
PRSP-II is
comprehensive with nine pillars,
ranging from macroeconomic stability
and real sector growth to social
protection and governance. Table 8
below highlights the PRSP-II pillars
and sectors/areas covered under each.

51.
The strategy recognizes that to
steer Pakistan back on a path of broad-based growth, create jobs, and reduce poverty, a prolonged period
of macroeconomic stability, financial discipline and sound policies is required. Government’s strategy
aims to create adequate employment opportunities, and to improve income distribution and
competitiveness through economic liberalization, deregulation and transparent privatization. To mitigate
poverty, it aspires for pro-poor growth, with more emphasis than under the previous strategy on
agriculture and manufacturing, as well as on services. It also seeks to strengthen the social safety net to
protect the poor and vulnerable. The strategy also recognizes that gender disparities represent a critical
constraint to achieving Pakistan’s development objectives and reaffirms Pakistan’s commitment to
implementation of the Convention on Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women

16

(CEDAW). The strategy to address gender inequality features measures to increase women’s access to
services and opportunities in the short term along with a range of reforms to increase political, economic
social and legal empowerment of women.
52.
While PRSP-II provides a comprehensive framework for Pakistan’s efforts to stabilize the
economy and bring it back to a higher growth path, it also has several limitations. Progress in critical
areas for poverty reduction will require greater harmonization with provincial activities. While the
strategy refers to provincial initiatives and programs, in particular in the areas of health and education
where provinces bear most of the burden of service delivery, it is not systematically coordinated with
provincial strategies and plans, or the coordination mechanism is not clearly spelled out.
53.
PRSP-II advocates a productivity-based export strategy. However, by focusing on specific
product groups, the export strategy may invite introduction of distortions rather than a level playing field
for all product groups and for firms of all sizes, especially if there are no effective criteria for choosing
potential beneficiaries and the nature and duration of incentives provided to them. In this context, an
important area of focus would be policy and program actions in areas which are seen as barriers to entry
and growth, such as land markets, creditor right enforcement, an improved judiciary and strengthened
competition policy.
54.
Perhaps the major concern with PRSP-II is its very ambitious thematic and sectoral scope relative
to the institutional capacity to implement it over its stipulated timeframe. The PRSP-II recognizes the
limitations in the public sector’s governance and institutional capacity for its implementation but proposes
a limited reform agenda to strengthen these areas. The strategy explains why public financial
management, civil service reform, tax administration, and judicial and public procurement reform are all
good things to pursue, but in some cases—for example, in the case of public procurement and judicial and
civil service reform—little is said about what is proposed for the coming years, how this will be attained
and the extent to which progress (or lack thereof) in these areas will advance the execution of the overall
PRSP.
55.
The concerns about execution of the strategy have received added impetus in recent months in the
wake of the recent NFC Awards (para. 19) and its changes in the distribution of fiscal resources between
the federal and provincial governments. Government now envisages that there will need to be major
strategic shifts in the role and responsibilities of the civil service, public enterprises and other public
agencies and major enhancements in their capacity and effectiveness in order to ensure that service
delivery, financial and development goals are achieved. The government plans to further revise the PRSP
to reflect these expected strategic shifts.
IV.

PROPOSED WORLD BANK GROUP STRATEGY, FY2010-2013
A.

Lessons Learned from the Past

56.
The FY06-09 CAS envisioned a significant increase in the volume of Bank financing for Pakistan
with an overall IBRD/IDA lending envelope of up to $6.5 billion ($3.1 billion of IDA and $3.4 billion of
IBRD) under a high case scenario characterized by strong performance and improving creditworthiness.
With the onset of the political, economic and security crises, this scenario could not be realized; Bank
lending for the CAS period totaled $4.6 billion ($4 billion IDA and $0.6 billion IBRD) with IDA
exceeding the planned amount due to the higher IDA15 resource envelope. IBRD lending fell short as
macroeconomic deterioration led to a decline in creditworthiness and a suspension in IBRD lending in
late FY08 in line with the low case scenario outlined in the CAS. IFC, in contrast, was able to commit
investment financing of approximately $960 million, exceeding the CAS target of $500-600 million.
57.
The CAS Completion Report (Annex II) presents an assessment of the previous Bank strategy
and points out that the previous CAS was implemented during a particularly volatile time in Pakistan,

17

which partly explains its limited impact. Owing to political turmoil and deteriorating security, many of
the gains in growth and poverty reduction were reversed. There were mixed achievements in
strengthening governance: while in-roads were made in public financial management and community-led
development, governance issues remained largely unaddressed due to lack of political will. At the same
time, the Bank’s response to the 2005 earthquake was deemed excellent, efforts through the Pakistan
Poverty Alleviation Fund were strong, and there were solid achievements in education.
58.
Drawing on the findings of the CAS Completion Report as well as the 2005 Country Assistance
Evaluation, the CPS reflects seven key lessons of experience from the Bank’s engagement in Pakistan:
• Flexibility is essential. The FY06-09 CAS could not foresee the degree of political upheaval and
deteriorating security environment experienced in Pakistan over the past three years.
Nevertheless, the Bank was able to reorient the country program, both in terms of focus (e.g.,
increased attention to social protection) and instruments (reducing the reliance on policy-based
sector lending) in order to help the Government to weather the immediate crisis and begin to
build the foundations for renewed growth while strengthening the emphasis on the achievement
of results as the basis for the Bank’s support.
• The Bank needs to focus more on the longstanding structural problems that contributed to the
rapid erosion in growth and stability while being realistic about the difficulty in addressing
them. Efforts to address these problems, including measures to increase tax revenue collection,
contain government spending and to reduce the anti-export bias in economic policy were
underway during the last CAS period, but these either proved to be short lived or impossible to
follow through on in the prevailing political climate. As a result, the strong growth performance
at the time of CAS preparation could not be sustained. Strengthening the institutional foundation
to support sustained implementation of reforms is clearly an essential element in reducing the
likelihood of a repeat of the policy reversals that have been characteristic of the past. But, it is
not enough. In particular, the political economy context is crucial in determining what
institutional reforms are viable and sustainable and the Bank needs to make clear judgments as to
the scope and structure of its support given its assessment of this context. In some cases, this
assessment might well lead to the Bank not engaging in certain areas where the pay-off to our
involvement is particularly uncertain.
• Once it decides that there are sound grounds for its involvement and support, the Bank needs
to be less ambitious and more realistic about the likely pace of institutional reform and
capacity building in Pakistan. Reforming institutions and bringing about systemic change (e.g.,
civil service reform, reforming the Federal Bureau of Revenue, improving land records
administration, and strengthening the performance of public sector institutions) almost without
exception proceeded more slowly than anticipated in the CAS or project documents. The legacy
of decades of state neglect to address crucial reforms and the influence of entrenched interests are
difficult to overcome, requiring sustained engagement over a long period.
• Timely and reliable monitoring and evaluation is critical to achieving results. Strong
monitoring to measure how programs are delivering and to track results is critical for measuring
performance and implementation, and refining interventions through better informed decision
making. To ensure the quality of data, results should be validated through independent means
including third-party surveys and social accountability mechanisms. Monitoring at the level of
the overall country program is needed as well as at the level of individual operations in order to
support a dialogue with the client on the need for adjustments in the direction of the overall
country program.
• Program delivery targets need to be realistic. The upper end of the proposed program under the
FY06-FY09 CAS represented a nearly three-fold increase in lending for Pakistan. In light of the
uncertainties and implementation constraints, this was extremely ambitious. The proposed CPS

18

therefore outlines a more modest priority IBRD/IDA lending program of approximately $3.7
billion while also identifying a potential lending envelope of up to $6.0 billion. This approach is
intended to provide a selective focus in key areas while leaving open the possibility of doing
more should conditions permit.
• Programmatic investment operations can provide multi-year support for reforms while
addressing implementation capacity constraints. The previous CAS included substantial
sectoral policy-based lending. While development policy lending proved effective in bringing
about the adoption of significant policies and reforms programs greater attention was needed to
capacity building and implementation support. Responding to this need, the CPS program
reflects a shift toward greater use of programmatic investment operations that include technical
assistance and institutional support interventions to improve planning, management, governance
arrangements and monitoring capacity.
• Given Pakistan unique development and geopolitical challenges, enhanced partnership
arrangements are critical. A number of development partners have scaled up assistance to
Pakistan over the past several years. Donors and government are seeking coordinated financing
mechanisms and enhanced policy and strategic dialogue in order to increase aid effectiveness and
reduce the strain on government capacity. Greater use of instruments like SWAPs and use of the
MDTF will therefore be a feature of the proposed CPS. Facilitating communication and the
development of shared results frameworks will also be an increasing focus, both in the context of
the overall aid effectiveness dialogue and in the context of MDTF-supported activities in the
border areas.
B.

Feedback from Consultations

59.
Multi-stakeholder consultations on the priorities for the CPS were conducted in July 2009 and
January 2010 in Pakistan. A wide variety of stakeholders within federal and provincial governments,
private sector, academia, think tanks, civil society organizations, and other development partners were
interviewed. Feedback on priorities was remarkably consistent across all these groups.
60.
All consulted groups viewed improving governance to be a priority. Weak or corrupt
management rather than lack of resources was considered to be the main constraint to improved service
delivery. Similarly, given frequent load-shedding, increasing the availability of energy was viewed as
essential, with significant interest in alternative forms of energy to help mitigate costs and ensure
reliability of supplies. Agriculture was seen as critical for restoring and sustaining inclusive growth, and
the groups consulted recommended that the Bank move beyond irrigation to support measures to enhance
yields and efficient use of inputs. Finally, the promotion of public-private partnerships, notably in the
delivery of basic services such as education, was suggested as a means to address some governance
concerns.
C.

Strategic Priorities for Bank Group Support: The CPS Pillars

61.
Drawing on the analysis of the challenges Pakistan faces, and the lessons that the Bank has
learned in supporting Pakistan in recent years, the CPS is centered on four pillars: (i) improving economic
governance; (ii) accelerating delivery of human development and social protection services; (iii)
improving infrastructure to support growth; and (iv) improving security and reducing the risk of conflict.
The clusters of outcomes to be supported under each of the CPS’ pillars are summarized in Table 9.
62.
With respect to seeking to support Pakistan to improve economic governance the CPS program
will focus on measures to enhance Pakistan’s resilience to shocks that undermine its capacity to deliver
basic services, improve social indicators and promote essential public and private investment in
infrastructure. Pakistan has been subject to a variety of shocks ranging from weather, seismic and flood

19

events, international energy resource price changes, geopolitically-conditioned flows of external
assistance, to domestic political turmoil. Supporting the creation of institutions and mechanisms to
smoothly and effectively manage or absorb such shocks and their impacts in the future will be central to
the Bank Group’s efforts.

63.
In supporting Pakistan to enhance human development outcomes, the CPS will focus on
consolidating and extending the efforts started in the last year of the previous CAS to reorient our
engagement in the education sector to focus explicitly on the achievement of results and to reinforce the
mutual accountability for results under our partnership. Specifically, we would continue the shift in our
engagement across the human development sectors to one that conditions timely and predictable Bank
support and disbursements on achievement of agreed results on the ground based on clearly specified and
agreed upon results frameworks.

The support for infrastructure under this CPS represents a re-engagement in a significant and
direct way in this sector by the Bank after a very limited presence under the two previous CASs. The
focus of our renewed engagement will be on helping Government to sustainably expand the availability
and reliability of electricity supplies. Infrastructure investments will be crucial to both addressing the
major constraints to economic output in the short to medium term and, given the opportunities for
regional collaboration in infrastructure investment and provision, to enabling Pakistan to start building
ties to regional markets. This will be closely linked with assistance to help further develop a competitive
private sector in Pakistan. In particular, building on the substantial increase in IFC investments during the
previous CAS period, the Bank Group will increasingly seek to mobilize private sector players through
public private partnerships and market development approaches.
65.
Under the conflict pillar, the Bank will support Government to implement its strategy to promote
broader and deeper development in the conflict-affected areas of Pakistan and enhance the presence and

20

responsiveness of the state to citizens in these areas. This strategy will build on the Post-Crisis Needs
Assessment (PCNA) currently being prepared in close collaboration with the ADB, the European Union
and the UN at the request of the Government. The PCNA will provide a strategic framework that
identifies priority areas for interventions to promote peace and prevent a relapse into conflict. The
framework will have as its foundation detailed analyses of the causes and drivers of conflicts based on
input from a variety of sources: extensive consultations with and perception surveys of the directly
affected populations and other stakeholders in FATA and KP, available analyses of the historical,
political, economic and ideological genesis of the conflict in the area, and lessons from conflicts in other
societies. This framework will also serve as a conflict filter for the Bank for the activities that it will
support in conflict-affected areas through both its own programs and budgetary and lending resources and
through other programs supported by trust funds under its administration.
66.
The strategy will prioritize Bank support as follows: First, we will give special focus to the
achievement of those outcomes that have the potential to be truly transformational. These outcomes are
deemed to be pivotal to the sustained achievement of most of the rest of PRSP-II objectives and CPS
outcomes and will be the areas where the Bank Group will concentrate much of its efforts. Pakistan
cannot effectively build the foundation to make headway on exploiting its strategic advantages and
endowments in the medium to long-term without successfully addressing these very basic issues. In each
of these “transformational” areas, the Bank will mobilize all of its instruments – including AAA, lending,
and Trust Funds – to help Pakistan achieve its development objectives. These transformational outcomes
are:
•

Strengthening Tax Policy and Administration: raising the ratio of tax to GDP (currently only
10.2 percent of GDP) is absolutely essential if Pakistan is to have the resources to invest in
human development and infrastructure, and if it is to build resilience to future shocks and guard
against costly and disruptive growth reversals.

•

Expanding Power Provision: reforming the power sector and ensuring sustainable expansion of
supply is absolutely essential if industrial and service activity is to be increased and productivity
raised.

•

Addressing Security: coping with the consequence of conflict while reducing the prospects of
future conflict is essential for social cohesion, stability and long term growth both in the directly
affected and vulnerable communities but also in the rest of the country. This is a highly complex
area, and the Bank’s competence and knowledge is evolving but limited. We will, however, make
this a major thrust of our work, giving emphasis to service provision and job creation in highly
vulnerable areas, (and drawing upon emerging analyses from the WDR and from work in
Pakistan).

67.
Second, in addition to these “transformational musts” the strategy identifies a core program of
support to improve educational and health outcomes, strengthen the potential for increased and more
productive labor force participation, reinforce safety net systems and enhance the earning capacity of the
poor and vulnerable. These objectives relate directly to key elements of the MDGs and related social
outcomes and indicators. The core program also includes selected investments in ports, water
management and financial management to facilitate growth and strengthened public sector governance.
68.
These two program areas comprise the priority lending program to be financed during the CPS.
The outcomes and outputs associated with the priority program are described in the results framework at
Annex 1 and summarized in Table 10 below. The selected outputs are defined by a number of
characteristics. They represent outputs where Government has demonstrated interest, commitment and
capacity in implementing or utilizing support, including making progress in putting enabling policy and
institutional frameworks in place. They are also areas where the Bank has developed knowledge and

21

experience of the risks of implementation and results and has the capacity to effectively support
Government. Finally, they represent programs that can be fully and adequately prepared for
implementation during the CPS period.

Admittedly, the transformational high priority program presents particularly difficult and
longstanding challenges. The Bank has been extending support to Pakistan to address tax revenue
mobilization and fiscal space issues as well as energy sector performance and regulatory challenges for
the past two decades with only limited success in helping Pakistan to overcome deep political economy
challenges, create effective and viable institutions and show durable results. Recognizing that these
problems are not necessarily amenable to short-term solutions, the Bank has committed itself to these
issues over the long term, and will work strongly in partnership with others. With respect to the core
program, the Bank is on more solid footing, with a track record of innovation and some measure of
success in scaling obstacles to achieving sustained and increasing results, notably in education and safety
nets in recent years.
70.
Finally, the CPS envisages the potential for the program to expand beyond this priority program
to address key challenges which do not meet all of the selectivity criteria above but where the Bank would
like to support the government to lay the basis successfully addressing significant challenges. Such
challenges include fostering livability and economic growth and dynamism within Pakistan’s cities,
supporting provincial authorities to enhance own-revenue mobilization and ensure effective public
expenditures, and attracting private sector financing to large scale infrastructure investments. The CPS
will support such activities where the individual programs are ready and the prospects for success and
results are strong. We will also link expansion of the overall lending program beyond the priority
program to progress being made against the objectives of the transformational activities. The Bank would

22

not seek to expand the scope of its program of support if the government is not making sufficient progress
on resolving electricity supply issues and on tax revenue mobilization.
71.
The priority lending program amounts to an estimated $3.7 billion (IBRD/IDA), equivalent to
about 60 percent of a total potential financing envelope of up to $6.2 billion (including MDTF financing)
during the CPS period. The priority program is summarized in Table 11 below.

72.
We have also identified subsectors and thematic areas where the Bank will not lend under the
CPS and will only maintain a very limited engagement, if any. In the energy sector, the Bank will
concentrate its support on helping Pakistan exploit its considerable hydropower potential, improve the
efficiency of utilization of developed hydropower capacity and natural gas resources and reduce leakages
and losses of both energy resources and electricity. Given our limited resources and capacity and this
commitment, the Bank will not engage in coal.
73.
On governance, specifically in the areas of civil service and judicial reforms, other partners have
a substantial depth of knowledge and capacity and, in some cases, a significant track record of
engagement in Pakistan. The Bank will not duplicate the capacity and efforts of such partners in Pakistan
and will not be actively engaged in these areas under the CPS.
74.
A number of development partners are active in the health sector, both at the center and in the
provinces and are providing active partnership and leadership on the health agenda. The Bank has
recently completed a review of the sector and is actively engaged as a knowledge partner of the
government in health insurance and financing in the context of our work on strengthening safety nets and
disseminating global and regional practices in the field. In partnership with UNAIDS and other
development partners, we have been active in supporting the efforts of the Federal and Provincial
governments on HIV/AIDS. We have also started preparation of a potentially catalytic project addressing
chronic nutritional deficiencies amongst mothers and children. We will continue in this limited role of
advocacy, very selective and catalytic lending and knowledge sharing and partnership in key areas in the
sector.
75.
In agriculture, the Bank envisages playing a major role during the CPS period only in providing
analytical support to government and the development partners to formulate strategies and policies to

23

increase value-added in the sector. We may extend this role to supporting the government to develop
program platforms that may serve as vehicles for other development partners to provide financing to the
sector, subject to demand from government and development partners.
76.
The Bank has had a long, productive engagement in the telecoms sector focusing on helping the
government to formulate and implement reforms. These reforms led to a large inflow of foreign
investment in the sector and dramatic improvements in sector performance. The sector looks to its own
resources and to the market for financing and advisory services and the Bank has no compelling role in
the sector given other pressing demands on our resources.
77.
There are sectors, like highways, where risks are such that the Bank Group will choose not to
engage pending significant improvement in institutional governance or strong measures being taken by
Government to mitigate risks, including fraud and corruption risks. The case for Bank financing of cost
overruns under an ongoing highways rehabilitation project is currently under review. Other than the
possible financing of this case, if justified, the Bank will not engage in the highway sector during this
CPS period. Other partners are already substantially engaged in this subsector.
78.
On Public Private Partnerships, the Bank and IFC will work closely together to pursue
economically and financially attractive opportunities that are consistent with both our strategic emphasis
in promoting investments in power and transport. The Bank will support such activities through its
guarantee instrument (focusing its role on sector governance and regulatory issues) while relying on IFC
to provide leadership and expertise in assessing the appropriateness, financial viability and the adequacy
of the risk allocation features of specific proposals.
79.
The Bank Group engagement will reflect the need for flexibility. The support of the Bank under
the proposed CPS is structured to be flexible in the face of considerable uncertainty and to ensure that its
level is closely tied to evolving evidence of its likely effectiveness. Despite the recent promising
developments on many fronts, the operating environment in Pakistan is likely to continue to be uncertain
during the CPS period, reflecting three key factors: insecurity, especially in the western border areas of
FATA and KP; domestic political conditions; and macroeconomic or sectoral conditions. Overall Bank
lending and IFC investment over the CPS period will depend crucially on macroeconomic and sector
policy performance, political and security conditions, and investment climate – all of which underpin the
viability and sustainability of the Bank Group’s program under the CPS. Slippages in macroeconomic
performance may undermine the basis for the Bank Group’s engagement for budget support operations,
impair access to IBRD resources and affect the viability of some of our sector programs. Similarly, our
investment lending operations require the effective implementation of key sector policies. The design of
the CPS provides strong inbuilt mitigation to some performance risks to which the Bank program is
exposed by linking our support in most of the programs either to achieved agreed results or completed
key prior actions. Our support is designed to be scaleable, upwards or downwards, depending on
program performance. Political and macroeconomic instability will also limit the growth in IFC’s
investment program. In such eventuality, IFC will put greater emphasis on portfolio management and
short-term self-liquidating trade finance investments.
Pillar 1: Improving Economic Governance
80.
Strengthened Tax Policy and Administration. Enhancing domestic revenue mobilization will be
an urgent priority during the CPS period. To address chronic underfunding of key services (see table 6)
and avoid episodic crises, tax revenue needs to be substantially increased. Otherwise, targeted
improvements in social indicators and physical infrastructure will remain unaffordable. So far, progress
has been elusive; instead of increasing, the overall tax to GDP ratio has declined in the past couple of
years. Also, while there has been some improvement in the organization and management of the Federal
Bureau of Revenue (FBR), more progress is needed, especially in improving compliance. The authorities
have an ambitious target for increasing the tax to GDP ratio, and will need to adopt significant changes in

24

tax policy to widen the tax net, while strengthening tax compliance through improvements in tax
administration. The government’s strategy for increasing tax revenue combines tax policy and tax
administration reforms. On tax policy, the main driver will be implementation of a broad-based VAT
beginning in FY11. On tax administration, the Government will continue to pursue a shift from a “typeof-tax” organizational structure to a functionally integrated tax administration. In a type-of-tax structure,
each tax—sales tax, income tax, excise tax, and customs duties—has its own administration. Taxpayers
face a confusing array of different rules, processes and procedures to obtain tax registration, file returns,
make payments, manage audits, and file appeals. This creates an unnecessary duplication of services that
should be common across all tax types. More importantly, by increasing the number of points of contact
between tax collectors and taxpayers and multiplying rules across different taxes, a type-of-tax structure
opens greater opportunities for discretion in the application of tax laws, and hence, corruption.
81.
In the past couple of years, the World Bank has put increasing emphasis on tax policy and
administration reforms, and increased assistance to these areas through analytical and non-lending
technical assistance supported by the UK Department for International Development (DFID). The
ongoing Tax Administration Reform Project (TARP) has been supplemented by an intensive technical
assistance effort at the federal level. In parallel, a comprehensive study of Pakistan’s tax system,
structure and policies was carried out to identify weaknesses and options for tax policy reform, and
technical assistance provided to support introduction of a VAT. This support will be further intensified
during the upcoming CPS period. Given Government’s renewed commitment to tax administration
reform and the enhanced urgency of increasing tax revenues due to the economic crisis, TARP (which
was originally scheduled to close in December 2009) has been extended by two years, and the federal
level technical assistance program will be continued. To start tapping the significant untapped revenue
potential at the provincial level, analysis of provincial revenue mobilization is proposed to be carried out
and, provided provincial governments are willing to address identified weaknesses, we will follow that
with a provincial lending operation to strengthen provincial tax administration and policies. Further, in
view of declining customs duties and reported leakages, an assessment of customs policies and
procedures is proposed to be carried out and, as required, technical assistance mobilized to strengthen
customs administration.
82.
Improved Macroeconomic Management. Macro instability in Pakistan stems partly from
shortcomings of economic management. The fact that, despite years of implementing economic reforms,
Pakistan’s economic management was unable to withstand the pressures emerging from a changed
political situation in the country and a worsening international economic environment reflects the fragility
of economic institutions in the country. Addressing the shortcomings of Pakistan’s economic
management is critical not only for restoring macroeconomic stability but also for reducing the likelihood
of reversals leading to another cycle of growth giving way to stagnation.
83.
A new series of Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSC) is proposed to be the Bank’s primary
lending instrument to support strengthening of macroeconomic management at the federal level. This
will complement continued strong partnership with the ADB and, in particular, the IMF with PRSCs
reinforcing key elements of the Stand-By Arrangement, including reforms in tax administration and
energy pricing. PRSCs will also support other crosscutting and sector-specific issues and will serve as a
platform for other donors (e.g., Japan) to provide parallel financing in support of critical reforms. A
Country Economic Memorandum will be prepared early in the CPS period to inform the medium-term
reform process. Also, the work on monitoring the poverty trends and determinants will continue. The
PRSC will be complemented by a series of analytical and non-lending technical assistance to strengthen
economic management in various areas as highlighted below, to inform and guide the reform process.
84.
Strengthened Public Expenditure, Financial and Procurement Management: Public
expenditure management at all levels of government will continue to be a focus. Currently, development
programs and projects are approved without adequate consideration of their fiscal impact, while
efficiency and effectiveness of public expenditure are low. At the same time, the government lacks

25

efficient cash management. There is no comprehensive cash management framework with a Treasury
Single Account (TSA) and weekly cash flow forecasting. As a result public sector entities have
accumulated significant idle cash balances outside the Treasury system at the same time as borrowing
requirements have continued to increase significantly. In addition, there is weak oversight of fiscal risks
related to public and state-owned enterprises. Further, the regulatory environment governing public
procurement remains incomplete, and there is lack of monitoring and grievance handling system.
85.
There have been some improvements. For example, through the Second Project for Improvement
of Financial Reporting and Auditing (PIFRA II) good progress has been made in improving public
financial management, including the roll-out of the new government-wide Chart of Accounts consistent
with international standards for budgeting, accounting, and financial reporting; improved timeliness in the
rendering of accounts for audit and the completion of the audit processes using improved risk-based audit
practices that conform to international standards; adoption of international public sector accounting
standards; and enhanced disclosure in financial reports. Also, the government is in the process of shifting
to a medium-term budgeting framework.
86.
During the CPS period, the Bank will seek opportunities, primarily through AAA and Technical
Assistance to assist the government to improve management of development spending, and support the
move away from single-year budgeting to a medium term budget framework. Government recognizes
that the project planning, expenditure, and evaluation processes managed by the Planning Commission
need strengthening. The Bank will continue supporting the transition to a Treasury Single Account
(TSA) system with a comprehensive cash management framework. In parallel, the Bank is proposing to
conduct Public Expenditure Reviews in the two largest provinces, provided they concur, to identify the
gaps and options for reform. Further analytical work is planned in public financial management,
including public financial accountability assessments covering at least two provincial governments.
PIFRA II is scheduled to close in December 2010. However, further support through additional
financing, to sustain reforms is planned. The Bank will also continue working towards improving public
procurement at federal and provincial levels through improvement of procurement regulations and
procedures, development of procurement institutions, and institutionalizing third party procurement
monitoring with independent grievance mechanisms. In addition to analytical work, much of the work on
procurement is proposed to be done in the context of sectoral lending operations.
87.
Strengthened Competitiveness and Governance of Markets. Global competitiveness indicators
rank Pakistan in the bottom quartile of the world even prior to the recent economic and political
instability. While power is considered to be the main constraint to business at present, there are
governance related barriers to competition including labor market rigidities, firm barriers to entry and
overwhelming complications to exit. Key weaknesses in market governance and policy include: (i) weak
governance and oversight of corporate firms; (ii) an insolvency regime that is fragmented and has key
gaps in its provisions; (iii) factor markets that lack flexibility; (iv) high entry costs into business that
fosters a high level of informality; (iv) an incoherent trade policy framework with considerable
distortions; and (v) an export promotion framework that is ineffective, costly and fails to reduce the antiexport bias in the system. Addressing these issues through support for improvements in the legal and
policy framework for outward oriented growth will be a goal of the Bank’s policy dialogue and will be
supported with analytical work as well as through our PRSC engagement, where appropriate.
88.
Priorities for the financial sector are three-fold: further deepening of the financial sector,
strengthening financial infrastructure and increasing access. Through AAA and policy dialogue the Bank
will support increased efficiency, competition and broadening of financial markets through restructuring
and resolution/ privatization of the remaining and more importantly loss making public sector banks,
DFIs and specialized banks. Building on earlier technical assistance we will also support improving
financial infrastructure including payment systems, credit information and banking laws to strengthen and
enhance stability and efficiency of financial transactions. With respect to Anti-Money Laundering and
Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT), the GoP has taken important steps, on the legal and

26

regulatory front (adoption by Parliament of an AML law, issuance of AML/CFT regulations by the
financial sector supervisors) as well as in terms of implementation (notably by the strengthening of the
financial intelligence unit). The Bank plans to maintain a policy dialogue with the authorities on
AML/CFT issues, and to provide technical assistance to the authorities in close coordination with
partners.
89.
Access to finance is a major constraint impeding private sector development in Pakistan. Recent
data indicate that Pakistan’s microfinance penetration is among the lowest in Asia at 1 percent, while 93
percent of SMEs lack access to finance. The CPS will seek opportunities to build the financial
infrastructure platform necessary to support financial institutions in building their capacity and incentives
to increase financial outreach to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME), as well as poor
households, women, and micro enterprises and also expand the housing finance market. IFC's strategy in
Pakistan is to increase access to finance for underserved groups, especially MSME clients. IFC’s support
to Pakistan’s financial sector include the following areas: (i) wholesaling through financial intermediaries
to support agribusiness, health, education and infrastructure; (ii) providing support for international trade
through trade finance facilities; (iii) equity investments in banks involved in SME financing; (iv)
investments in insurance and sustainable finance; and (iv) Advisory Services support in the areas of SME
and housing finance, credit bureau, capital markets development, corporate governance, business and
management skills training, and Alternative Dispute Resolution. IFC has also established an Alternate
Dispute Resolution Center (ADR) in Karachi and is currently in the process of establishing one in Lahore
to be followed by Peshawar. The scope of ADRs is to provide alternate legal recourse to SMEs and
women. In the area of financial markets and work relating to Doing Business/Investment Climate
improvements, both IFC and World Bank teams will collaborate closely to capitalize on synergies and
each institution’s comparative advantage.
Pillar 2: Improving Human Development and Social Protection
90.
Improving Pakistan’s relatively weak human development indicators represents one of Pakistan’s
longstanding challenges and the PRSP II envisages major investment in strengthening the human resource
base. The Government recognizes that its goals for growth and poverty reduction cannot be met without a
healthy, skilled and competent workforce that can respond to the demands of a growing economy.
Improvement in human development, including social protection, is also critical to this CPS’ goal of
building resilience at the level of families and individuals. The focus of Bank Group efforts will be to
support the increase and reorientation of public expenditure toward human development along with
reforms to improve governance and accountability in the provision of services, with enhanced attention to
assessing and addressing the needs of vulnerable groups among the poor, such as women and displaced
people.
91.
While progress was made during the previous CAS period, Pakistan’s human development
indicators continue to lag behind those of countries with similar incomes and levels of development.
Literacy has risen from 53 percent in 2005 to 56 percent in 2008, gross primary enrollment rates increased
from 86 percent to 91 percent, secondary gross enrolment rates increased from 44 percent to 50 percent,
while tertiary gross enrollment rates are estimated to have risen from 3 percent to 4 percent of the eligible
age cohort (17-23). In addition, there is slow progress in improving health outcomes including child,
infant and maternal mortality, and in enhancing the provision of reproductive health services. Under-five
mortality remains the highest among the large South Asian countries, as does the fertility rate (Pakistan’s
TFR is 4.1 compared to 2.9 in India and Bangladesh). Chronic child malnutrition is very high at around
40 percent. Significant gender and rural/urban disparities persist.
92.
Improved Equitable Access to Quality Education Services. In education, the government is
committed to doubling education expenditures from 1.5 percent of GDP (in 2003 to 3 percent of GDP) by
2013 as envisaged in the Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation Act (FRDLA), 2005 that provides an

27

indication of the minimum level of public funds to be allocated to the education sector. 5 In FY07,
education expenditure reached 2 percent of GDP; however they have since fallen as a result of the
macroeconomic crisis, reaching around 1.8 percent of GDP in FY09. The Bank Group CPS will support
a reversal in this trend.
93.
There is growing recognition of the importance of supporting education at all levels in the
country. The enrolment rates drop precipitously after primary schooling. From a primary school level (age
5-9) GER at 91 percent, (M: 97 percent, F: 83 percent), the GER drops to 50 percent (M: 59 percent, F:
41 percent) at the secondary level. There are several reasons for this drop but one reason that stands out is
the shortage of higher-level schools, especially in rural areas. There are, on average, six government
primary schools for each middle or higher-level school, and in some parts of the country this ratio is as
high as 1:13. The main thrust of the Bank’s efforts in primary and secondary education will be to support
sector wide provincial reform programs with and explicit focus on results through ongoing provincial
programmatic education investment loans. The CPS will support government programs that combine
supply side interventions (constructing and upgrading facilities, need driven and merit-based teacher
recruitment) and demand-side measures (free textbooks, female stipends, subsidies to low fee private
schools) to improve access to education with a focus on equity to address regional and gender imbalances.
World Bank support for these programs is supplemented by parallel financing arrangements from the UK,
Canada (in Punjab) and the European Union (in Sindh).
94.
The strategies supported by Bank operations in the education sector are designed to specifically
target schooling outcomes of female children. Specifically, education operations in both Sindh and
Punjab are financing payment of stipends to secondary age girls in public schools. Moreover, the
programs include supply side initiatives that address deficiencies that have a bigger impact on girls’
enrolments. For example service delivery elements targeted by these programs, such as local school
availability and teacher characteristics (i.e., female teachers) have been shown to have a larger effect on
girls’ participation.
95.
Tertiary education enrollment rates are especially low and estimated to be less than 4 percent of
the eligible age cohort (ages 17-23). Tertiary education is plagued by limited availability of appropriately
qualified faculty members, inadequate facilities, and weak quality assurance mechanisms. This compares
unfavorably with countries such as India and Malaysia with tertiary enrolment rates of 8 percent and 30
percent respectively. In line with the Government’s growth and competitiveness objectives, we will
continue to support a broad spectrum of strategic higher education reforms with an enhanced focus on
results. In addition, given that only 8 percent of the workforce had received formal vocational training,
we will assist in the development of technical and vocational training programs that help address skills
gaps.
96.
There is wide recognition that weak governance and accountability of service providers at all
levels is a major hurdle to the expansion of quality education. An increased focus on improving quality
by strengthening mechanisms and systems to measure student learning and promoting the use of
information on student learning will also be a central aspect of our education programs, supported by
enhanced community-based and third party monitoring of the quality of basic education. Institutional and
governance reforms will continue to form an integral part of the program with a view to increasing
accountability, reducing corruption and leakage and supporting evidence-based policy making. The CPS
5

Chapter II, 3 (3a) of the FRDLA states that: “ensuring that in every financial year, beginning from the first July,
2003, and ending on the thirtieth June, 20 13, the total public debt is reduced by not less than two and a half per
cent of the estimated gross domestic product for any given year: Provided that the social and poverty alleviation
related expenditures are not reduced below 4.5% of the estimated gross domestic product for any given year and
budgetary allocation to education and health, will be doubled from the existing level in terms of percentage of gross
domestic product during the next ten years”.

28

will support interventions to address gender, rural-urban, and provincial disparities. The education
operations are supported by analytical work, including several impact evaluations that are built into the
main education operations and a flagship Education Sector Review is envisaged during the CPS period.
IFC will attempt to address the mismatch in the quality of education provided and labor market needs by
exploring investment opportunities in high quality private education institutions (including vocational and
technical training), promoting training schools for teachers and nurses, supporting public-private
partnerships in education, and strengthening private service delivery of business development services.
IFC will specifically focus on increasing the access of women to quality education.
97.
Reduced Vulnerability Through Effective Safety Nets. The macroeconomic crisis in Pakistan
and the still unfolding global economic slowdown have made social protection an urgent priority – and a
strategic opportunity to build systems and institutions for better service delivery. Furthermore, the poor
and the non-poor alike remain vulnerable to individual level risks such as health shocks and
unemployment, and to community-wide risks such as natural disasters.
98.
Recognizing the urgent need to protect the poor and the vulnerable, the Government of Pakistan
launched a new flagship social safety net program in 2008, the Benazir Income Support Program. The
Bank is partnering with the Government in establishing the Benazir Income Support Program (BISP) as
the country’s national safety net program with a focus on increasing its targeting efficiency and
strengthening its operation. This will continue to be an important element of our strategy during the
period of the CPS, working with partners including the UK and the US. BISP has a strong focus on
empowerment of women since benefits of the program go exclusively to women. 6 In addition, the Bank
will support the consolidation of existing safety net programs as well as a harmonization with safety net
programs implemented by provincial governments (for example State Government of Punjab implements
a major Food Support Program; while the Government of KP is responding to the IDP crisis linked to
ongoing conflicts and also preparing a cross-sectoral HD project to better address the education, health
and social protection needs of the population). Likewise, the Bank will provide technical assistance for
the development of long-term exit/graduation-from-poverty strategies through targeted skills-training,
labor/employment opportunities (especially for young people and women), education and health
interventions. Finally, the Bank will support the development and implementation of workable health
insurance model based on international experience to the ultra poor population so that they do not have to
sell off their few resources in order to pay for hospital care.
99.
These graduation programs are at different stages of development at this time. The Government
has already piloted several CCTs to improve schooling outcomes of primary and secondary level children.
Health insurance for the poor is identified as a priority area in the Government’s new budget, but the key
policy decisions to increase the poor’s health care utilization and accompanying health-supply
arrangements are yet to be formulated. Similarly, implementation arrangements for facilitating exit from
poverty through skills-training and employment need to be developed. Complementary to the ongoing
SSN TA project, the Bank’s economic and sectoral work will focus on documenting and interpreting the
effects of economic shocks on the poor; evaluating the effectiveness of poverty exit/graduation strategies;
revealing the linkages between employment, poverty and vulnerability; and regularly updating the basic
social protection diagnostics (on safety nets, pensions, disability etc).
100.
Thus the Bank’s program to support the safety net reform agenda will combine support for key
reforms and institutional restructuring; investments to continue and scale up interventions that improve
6

International evidence on intra-household allocation and on the use of conditional cash transfers in other countries
provided to women has repeatedly shown the increases in women’s income translates in more expenditures for food,
children, clothing, education supplies and other goods for children (shoes, medicine, etc.). In addition, female
beneficiaries have reported an increase in their self-esteem and improved relationships in the family - with less
incidence of domestic violence by their partners or other decision-makers (in-laws) as they are more able to
contribute to the household’s economy.

the living conditions of highly vulnerable populations (including the poor, the IDPs and the disabled);
technical assistance to strengthen capacity for reform implementation at the federal and province levels;
and analytical work to inform policy makers and the design and implementation of Bank operations.
101.
Enhanced Rural Livelihoods. A large proportion of Pakistan’s poor live in rural areas and are
highly vulnerable to economic shocks (such as from the food price inflation), the effects of insecurity, and
to weather shocks and natural disasters. Strengthening the asset base of rural households and improving
their access to markets and services is therefore an important part of poverty exit and graduation
strategies. During the CPS period, the Bank Group will continue to support Pakistan, through the
Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund (PPAF) and other appropriately well-governed and managed entities,
to reduce the vulnerability and strengthen the livelihood opportunities - agriculture based and rural small
enterprises - of poor households. This will include a focus on vulnerable groups such as women, disabled
and youth. Community-based programs will focus on the enhancement of productive assets of the poor,
including their skills and financial assets, and the development of producer organizations and community
institutions so that they can more effectively link with markets and access government services (including
safety net programs). IFC business development programs will focus on expanding access to business
skills training tailored to small enterprises, especially targeting women entrepreneurs.
102.
Enhanced Delivery of Health Nutrition and Population Services. The proposed program also
focuses on better governance and management of delivery of basic health services to improve the
efficiency, coverage and the quality of essential health services, especially in disadvantaged areas of the
country. Further, this CPS will support Pakistan in developing service delivery models which will help
the country to sustain service delivery levels when these systems come under duress due to natural and
man-made disasters by providing support for emergency services both at community and facility level.
IFC will seek to help increase access to quality private health services by exploring investment
opportunities in private health facilities, and supporting public-private partnerships in the health sector.
103.
Levels of malnutrition are very high in South Asia and Pakistan is no exception. Malnourishment
in early life has a great impact on morbidity and mortality and is devastating to a child's potential for
education development and productivity later in life. This CPS will seek opportunities to address
malnutrition in a multi-sectoral way by adding components to ongoing and new programs in various
sectors that can contribute to the response. A national operation with a focus on maternal and child
nutrition will also be considered.
104.
Pakistan continues to face a challenge to address the concentrated epidemic of HIV infection
among street based drug users and its associated networks with increasing HIV prevalence among most at
risk population. The Bank will continue to support expansion of HIV/AIDS services for the vulnerable
population sub-groups through a follow-on Second HIV/AIDS project with a focus on service delivery
and surveillance especially in high prevalence provinces.
105.
Despite increasing allocations for the health sector under PRSP-I, Pakistan health financing
strategy remains inconsistent. Pakistan still spends only 0.6 percent of its GDP on health sector besides
spending on areas that do not facilitate progress towards MDGs. In health, the government is committed
to doubling health expenditures from 0.5 percent of GDP in 2003 to 1 percent of GDP by 2013 as
envisaged in the Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation Act (FRDLA), 2005, which provides an
indication of the minimum level of public funds to be allocated to the health sector. In addition, Pakistan
is also inadequately mobilizing external resources. The Bank will support Pakistan in development of
practical health financing strategy, enhance its health investments and spend it better on priorities to make
progress towards MDGs. The CPS will seek to help focus improving equity by enhancing access to basic
services package of acceptable quality with minimum cost to the poor and that facilities providing basic
services are adequately funded to provide the services.

30

Pillar 3: Improving Infrastructure to Support Growth
106.
Expanded Power Provision and Increased Efficiency and Reliability in Energy Supply.
Available and affordable power is critical to long-term growth and for improved quality of life. The
energy sector in Pakistan faces many challenges including significant supply shortages and financial
uncertainty. Despite significant energy resource endowments (particularly hydropower and natural gas),
Pakistan is a net importer of energy, mainly in the form of oil and petroleum products. Close to a third of
Pakistan’s power production is based on imported residual fuel oil. Over the past five years, government
has made some progress in addressing technical and commercial losses and bottlenecks in transmission
and distribution: overall losses have been reduced in four of the electricity distribution companies to
below 15 percent which is close to international best practice levels; one million new connections have
been added every year; and efforts to grant more managerial autonomy to the distribution companies are
well under way. Some progress has also been made in filling the shortfall in generating capacity in the
sector through expedited processing of IPPs in the pipeline. Nonetheless, the demand-supply gap remains
substantial and load shedding is likely to continue for some time.
107.
Sector finances were a major challenge when the current government took over two year ago but
government has made progress in substantially increasing cost recovery levels and putting in place
regulatory processes to allow for more timely and less political tariff adjustment procedures to reflect
underlying operating cost increases. Since 2008 consumer power tariffs have been increased by nearly 60
percent.
108.
During the CPS period, the Bank Group will support continued policy reforms in the sector. In
addition to the continued focus on sector financial viability, the Bank would support institutional reforms,
such as streamlining the institutional setup within the government to increase the efficiency of decision
making as regards policy formulation, planning and investments; strengthen the autonomy and
accountability of the sector entities, especially distribution companies, and refine the industry structure to
enable more private sector participation, including lessening the government's contingent liabilities (e.g.,
power purchase guarantees).
109.
The Bank Group will help in addressing the investment deficit. In view of the importance of
having sufficient gas for power production, the Bank would support the gas sector to improve efficiency,
reduce unaccounted for gas (UFG) and redeploy more gas to the power sector; and possibly support an
LNG import facility through the Bank’s guarantee instrument. An important focus of the Bank’s support
to the sector would be in the hydropower arena, where we plan to help finance the Tarbela power
generation expansion project (about 1000 MW additional capacity) and help government to complete
feasibility and design studies for other potential projects. Subject to the outcome of these studies, the
Bank will consider financing. In terms of regional cooperation, the World Bank and IFC, in concert with
other financiers, will help finance the Central Asia-South Asia Electricity Transmission and Trade Project
(CASA 1000), sponsored by Pakistan and Afghanistan (as prospective importers of electricity), and
Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan (as prospective exporters). Assistance to the electricity distribution
industry would be continued through the ongoing Electricity Distribution and Transmission Improvement
Project APL series. Assistance in the energy sector is coordinated closely with partners including the US,
Japan, and ADB.
110.
The Bank Group is already providing assistance to piloting energy conservation programs
through a series of initiatives including conversion of irrigation pumping to solar pumping, solar water
heating, launch of a CFL distribution program, and Smart Metering in distribution. We will scale up
some of these initiatives contingent on success of the current pilots. The Bank’s interventions in the
sector will also help ensure environmental global best practice, particularly regarding carbon based
energy and will include targeted efforts to reduce emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases.

31

111.
Supporting private investments in the power sector is a critical element of IFC’s strategy in
Pakistan. IFC will support development of the power sector through investments that are sustainable in
the long term and will focus supporting privatization of utility and distribution companies, as well as
development of renewable power generation (hydro and wind generation). IFC will also support
development of low cost thermal power (such as natural gas based combined cycle plants), which will
improve the sector’s operating costs, and on a selective basis, IFC will support development of fast track
oil based power plants that can alleviate the current power crises. IFC, under the Advisory Services, has
been engaged by the Government to assist in the privatization of Faisalabad Electricity Board (FESCO) –
a distribution company. This is being done on a pilot basis and, if successful, there is a long list of
distribution companies for the future. Based on demand from the investors in the power sector, IFC
Advisory Services can further partner with the companies to design and implement programs for
improving utility efficiency, reducing transmission losses and increasing energy productivity at consumer
level. IFC will also continue supporting reputable local/foreign players both in the upstream and
downstream sectors and expects to take blue chip Pakistan companies to work in other countries. IFC and
the World Bank are exploring opportunities to jointly finance power projects in Pakistan. Investment
prospects currently under varying stages of review and preparation include an LNG terminal and a run of
the river hydro prospect. The Bank plans to support these prospects, where appropriate, using our
guarantee instruments.
112.
Improved Efficiency and Reliability of the Transport and Logistics Network. Under the
previous CAS, the World Bank worked closely with Government in the design and implementation of the
National Trade Corridor Improvement Program (NTCIP). The national trade corridor linking Karachi to
Peshawar accounts for 95 percent of external trade and contributes 85 percent of GDP. The initiative
addresses constraints in rail, road, ports, and air services and infrastructure, and provides regional
cooperation opportunities, particularly with India, Afghanistan, Iran and China.
113.
Although the performance of the ports sector lags that of other regional ports, there has been
progress with increased participation of the private sector and improvements in dwell times and handling
charges. The Bank and IFC will finance the Karachi Port Improvement Project to support further
efficiency improvements. Other projects that support rationalization of the ports sector may also be
considered. Greater challenges lie in the restructuring of Pakistan Railways to reverse a longstanding
trend of freight shifting to roads. In the context of the government’s reform plans for public sector
enterprises, the Bank will provide support to the government to explore options to help improve the
utilization of the current rail infrastructure and to increase commercialization and strengthen financial and
operating performance in the sector. Pakistan’s ports and railways as well as its transport services
industry play a crucial role in regional trade links and improvements in their condition and performance
will have strong spillover benefits for its neighbors as well.
114.
IFC will be a significant investor—with MIGA supporting investments via PRI —in transport and
logistics, including ports, cement/clinker terminals, airlines and airports; and will explore establishment
of warehousing and cold chains. IFC is also focusing on supporting the port sector with sub-national
financing, where it is considering a loan to Karachi Port for berth reconstruction. IFC has also had initial
discussions with Port Qasim officials on finance for deepening of the main navigation channel. IFC is
seeking a pilot project on the privatization of toll roads and is expected to bid for the advisory services on
the Karachi- Hyderabad (N 9) toll road. This can pave the way for future privatization of other toll roads.
IFC is also at the very early stages of planning advisory work on the privatization of airports and will
study the gaps in the logistic sector.
115.
Strengthened Irrigation Infrastructure and Agricultural Competitiveness.
A critical
prerequisite for agricultural growth is good performance of Pakistan’s integrated irrigation system, a
sector in which the Bank has been deeply engaged and where we have a number of projects currently
under implementation. Bank support under the CPS will include rehabilitation of major assets such as
barrages and continued capacity development at the regional and federal level for managing water

32

resources. This work will complement the work of other partners in the irrigation sector including ADB
and Japan. The Bank’s assistance will put particular emphasis on improving the efficiency of irrigation
systems, taking into account the loss of soil fertility, salinity and water logging that have resulted from
inadequate irrigation and are estimated to have an economic cost of more than 1 percent of GDP per
annum.
116.
During the CPS period, we will start to shift the balance of our engagement in the sector towards
agriculture and the enhancement of productivity and value-addition. Making agriculture more efficient,
productive and profitable will help reduce poverty in Pakistan as agriculture accounts for 21 percent of
GDP and 43 percent of employment. At the same time, poverty is highest in the rural areas, and
approximately 75 percent of poor people reside outside cities. In Pakistan crop yields and livestock
productivity remain stagnant and substantially below yields achieved in other countries in Asia. Pakistan
has not diversified production, and has not focused on high value products such as export grade crops,
horticulture, livestock and fisheries.
117.
The World Bank Group Program envisions at first a program of technical assistance and support
to help Pakistan in setting agricultural policy analysis and design of good agricultural policies. This will
be closely coupled with an emphasis on knowledge engagement, working with the Government and
stakeholders to define critical areas for intervention either in terms of policy or critical public investments
to support and drive productivity in the sector. In this context, there is an urgent need to re-build
Pakistan’s agricultural policy analysis capacity and start to avoid costly policy mistakes. IFC will explore
investment opportunities in agribusiness (including warehousing and logistics), and support agribusiness
SMEs through financial intermediaries. In close coordination with emerging investment opportunities,
IFC Advisory Services will seek to (i) establish complementary programs in selected regions to enhance
the performance of promising agribusiness sub-sectors with high growth potential; and (ii) support the
development of interlinked agriculture industries such as agri-machinery, irrigation materials, packaging
and transport.
118.
Improving water resources management through efficient irrigation, improving the water
infrastructure including building multi-purpose storage dams and strengthening institutions responsible
for water management are some of the key actions urgently required to sustain and improve the water
sector and the agriculture sector. Under the ongoing Pakistan Water Capacity Building Project the World
Bank is assisting Pakistan to strengthen institutions and explore global best practice options for a range of
water sector improvements aimed at increasing the efficiency of the Indus system as a whole and to plan
better for allocation of water to different competing downstream uses and to minimize water related interstate conflicts. A critical aspect of the options being considered includes the feasibility of constructing
additional storage capacity, which could include larger dams. The project provides for assistance to
Pakistan to attract advisory services to structure public-private partnership and financing arrangements
when and if viable investment options are defined. A separate technical assistance program under
preparation with the Ministry of Environment will support the articulation of a national climate change
strategy and will take into account Pakistan’s water needs and the impact of emerging climatic change
issues. Within the scope of its agribusiness programs, IFC Advisory Services will assist in promoting the
adoption of environmentally sustainable practices and technologies such as High Efficiency Irrigation
Systems (HEIS), water recycling or reuse, waster treatment and recycling, and implementation of energy
efficient technologies throughout the agribusiness value chain.
119.
Improved Urban/Municipal Infrastructure and Services. Urban centers account for more than
one-third of Pakistan’s population and much of its economic power. In the coming years urbanization
will continue to accelerate, increasing the economic and demographic concentration of Pakistan around its
hierarchy of urban settlements – cities and towns. In this context, managing urban densities will be
critical to achieving the overall development goals in Pakistan. But, the policy challenge confronting the
urban sector is daunting: governance structures for cities are ill-defined, accountability to urban residents
is weak, resources are limited, and access to services is poor and inequitable. Improving cities livability

33

and strengthening their growth potential will also be a critical aspect of the development challenge
confronting Pakistan. The Bank’s strategy is meet this challenge by supporting the Government’s urban
policy and institutional reform agenda with a focus on the improvements in: (i) city management,
governance, and finance; (ii) urban municipal services; (iii) urban roads and transport systems; and (iv)
city planning, land use, and housing.
120.
Ongoing changes in the Punjab Local Government Ordinance have created promising
opportunities for the Bank to support the urban and local governance reform agenda in Punjab. The
Bank’s engagement has already provided the underpinnings for the preparation of Punjab Local
Governance Framework (PLGF) 2010 intended to reconfigure the existing governance structures at the
local level for strengthening accountability, transparency, service delivery, and citizen participation. In
this context, the Bank is proposing a multi-pronged approach to supporting the reform of the urban sector
in Pakistan, by focusing on both large cities and medium and small towns i.e. the whole urban hierarchy.
121.
The proposed Punjab Large Cities project will assist the Government of Punjab in implementing
the proposed reforms in a phased manner, to bring about a fundamental shift in the way cities are
managed. Furthermore, the Bank will extend its dialogue and technical assistance to launch similar
initiatives in the other provinces. The ongoing Punjab Municipal Services Improvement Project (PMSIP)
focuses on establishing a culture of accountability, through local government capacity building,
performance benchmarking, and providing investment grants to improve service delivery in the smaller
municipalities of the Punjab. The Bank proposes to further enhance its assistance in municipal services
through the Punjab Water and Sanitation Project. This will be complemented by the technical assistance
and capacity building initiative of the WSP. The Bank is also conducting economic and sector work in the
urban transport and housing sectors, to help shape its future involvement in these sectors.
122.
Environment Sustainability for Better Health Outcomes and Improved Competitiveness.
Improved environmental conditions and a strict environmental regulatory framework are important to
improve Pakistan’s competitiveness. Environmental degradation already constitutes an obstacle to
economic growth. The Bank has developed a suite of non-lending technical assistance, grant-financed
activities, and analytical work to support implementation of the National Environmental Policy (NEP),
address the impact of poor environmental policies on Pakistan’s industrial competitiveness, and develop
capacity at the provincial level for appropriate policy design and implementation. In response to the need
to support the development of the country’s capacity for environmental assessment, the Bank will support
an overall strengthening of Pakistan country environmental systems, including: (i) the capacity to identify
and address environmental problems/priorities in an effective manner, taking into account concerns of
stakeholders, particularly the most vulnerable groups, and (ii) its processes to adequately monitor and
evaluate progress to overcome these environmental priority problems. The Bank will also support
Government’s development and implementation of a broad climate change strategy, and will assist in
mobilization of support to allow for the realization of carbon finance revenues from implementation of
mitigation programs in a post-Kyoto carbon regime, including, but not limited to, efforts under the World
Bank Carbon Partnership Facility. IFC will support power generation by investments in low cost thermal
power (natural gas, and combined cycle) and renewable energy (like wind, hydro, and solar). IFC will
also provide Advisory Services supported by investments in the area of clean production technology.
Pillar 4: Improving Security and Reducing the Risk of Conflict
123.
Coping with the causes and consequences of the ongoing conflict in the Northwest Border region
is an urgent priority for the Government and Pakistan’s development partners. Conflict centered in
Pakistan’s Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province (KP) and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) has
had severe human and economic consequences in areas ranking amongst the poorest in Pakistan. The
insurgency has also extended its reach to other urban centers of Pakistan through targeted militant attacks
that have caused significant loss of life and degradation of investor confidence. The persistence of
conflict in KP and FATA poses a threat to some of the most vulnerable and marginalized populations in

34

Pakistan, while also challenging economic stability across the country. At the request of the Government,
the Bank in collaboration with the ADB, the EU and the UN, started to prepare a Post Crisis Needs
Assessment (PCNA) for KP and FATA. The PCNA is still underway, but community and other
stakeholder consultations already indicate potential priorities to address the structural sources of crisis and
contribute to peacebuilding during stabilization, consolidation and ultimately the transition to long-term
development.
124.
Increased Employment and Livelihood Opportunities in Conflict-Affected Areas. The absence
of employment opportunities and inadequate livelihoods in FATA and KP has created a favorable
environment for opportunistic militant groups whose economic incentives for potential recruits greatly
outweigh available opportunities. Consultations with communities as part of the PCNA process indicate
that creation of employment is identified as the most highly rated priority for intervention. KP and FATA
are dominantly agrarian economies, with livelihoods substantially predicated on agriculture and livestock.
Also evident was the importance of prioritizing opportunities especially, but not exclusively, for young
men (ages 15-29) who comprise the main target group for militant recruitment. Bank support, financed
by the planned Emergency Recovery Credit or from the MDTF may include support for
agricultural/livestock-linked employment and livelihoods, expansion of general and technical/vocational
education, investment in energy and transport, and social protection.
125.
Increased Responsiveness and Effectiveness of the State. Political and governance deficits may
be the single most important driver of crisis in FATA and KP today, perpetuating a historical experience
of disenfranchisement, alienation, corruption, poverty and underdevelopment, and facilitating the
conditions of lawlessness, insecurity and extremism that have fuelled the downward spiral of crisis.
Effective governance will require the establishment of robust interfaces that directly involve communities
in the planning, prioritization and implementation of programs. The writ of the state is most directly
extended and strengthened at the community level through those local government structures which are
potentially the most visible interfaces of the state. The strengthening of local government, particularly its
ability to efficiently and equitably deliver services, can greatly enhance the legitimacy of the state and
counter the claim to legitimacy by militant groups as a viable alternative to the state.
126.
To implement the findings of the PCNA as well as to contribute to the financing and
implementation of the DNA, the Bank will administer a Multi Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) 7 with estimated
contributions of about $150 million from various donors. The Trust Fund will support a comprehensive
reconstruction and development strategy designed to restore infrastructure, services and livelihoods while
addressing governance and other challenges that contribute to conflict. In addition the Bank will prepare
an Emergency Recovery Credit which will complement the MDTF program. Finally, a planned KP
Human Development operation will focus on strengthening service delivery in the context of conflict.
This is a highly complex area and one where the Bank does not have a track record of engagement in
Pakistan. Hence, specific interventions will be developed on the basis of the findings of the PCNA, but
will need to be flexible and adapted during implementation.

A. Portfolio Management

127.
During the last CAS period, despite mounting political, security and economic challenges,
portfolio performance remained reasonably strong (see Annex B8 and Table 12). The disbursement ratio
improved from 34 percent in 2008 to 40 percent for FY09, against a regional average of 24 percent.
Although Projects- at- Risk increased to 19 percent in FY10 (partly on account of greater realism in
assessing portfolio performance), the overall portfolio riskiness was less than the SAR and Bank
averages. While average project age has not increased, almost half the projects in the current portfolio are
7

35

five years or older, including two of the three largest projects. One third of the portfolio has had closing
dates extended, in most cases on account of additional financing required to respond to cost overruns
from unforeseen inflationary pressures or to expand the scope or scale of well performing projects. This
was broadly in accordance with the Region’s policy on project extensions.
128.

government. Regular interaction
with the government counterparts will assume even greater significance given the increasingly uncertain
and risk prone project implementation environment. The practice of holding regular portfolio review
meetings with Economic Affairs Division (EAD) at the federal level, and with the Planning and
Development Departments of the Provincial governments will continue as it has helped to ensure timely
attention to project issues and achievement of intended outputs and results during the implementation
period. In view of the lessons learnt from implementation over time, the Bank’s country team is
increasingly focusing on simplifying the design of new projects. Effective use is being made of the
“additional financing” mechanism to quickly scale up programs that have demonstrated effectiveness. In
terms of programming, we expect to see a shift in the portfolio mix during the new CPS period with
IBRD-funded sector investment projects supplementing the IDA-supported Sector-wide programmatic
(results-based) operations and the development policy credits focused principally on the PRSC series.
Finally, the project supervision strategy will place greater emphasis on providing implementation support
to the government and allocating resources according to the Operational Risk Assessment Framework
(ORAF)-assessed risk profile of a project, according to ORAF.
129.
During the CPS period, IFC will continue to work on maintaining a diversified portfolio in
Pakistan while seeking to partner with new clients. In the event of an adverse political and
macroeconomic environment, IFC will focus primarily on portfolio management, investments in shortterm self liquidating trade finance, supporting portfolio companies, and providing Advisory support. A
substantial proportion of IFC’s portfolio management in Pakistan is handled in the field.
130.
Managing Security Risks. Though Bank Group operations in Pakistan continue to show
satisfactory performance, given the uncertainty and security challenges, a business as usual approach is no
longer tenable. The deterioration in security conditions has already led to significant changes in the Bank
Group’s operational practices. Over the past two years, the Bank Group has progressively introduced
flexibility in procedures (including expanded Bank-financed access to computer and telecommunications
services to all staff) to allow staff to work off-site, increased vigilance and improved physical facilities to
enhance safety and security of the WBG staff and visiting missions. A strong core of field-based national
staff manages the majority of Bank Group operations in Pakistan, allowing the Bank to continue serving
the client in challenging circumstances (IFC has two field offices in Pakistan—Islamabad and Karachi).
However, the ongoing security concerns do constrain our ability to readily draw in international staff to
complement national staff and to readily deploy resident staff to deliver and supervise operations as we
try to manage the security footprint with a view to reducing the risk exposure of staff. This constraint is
particularly binding during periods of volatile security conditions and it particularly affects our ability to
deploy non-resident international staff. One strategy to partly relieve this constraint is to increase the
complement of relevant international staff in Islamabad. However, as a Phase III location under the
UNDSS security risk ranking system, Pakistan is a non-family posting -- a designation which, in
combination with increasing perceptions of insecurity in the country, has rendered Pakistan a relatively
unattractive site for long-term assignments for internationally recruited staff (IRS). Another mitigation
approach is to reduce the level and complexity of output to simplify both our safety and security risk

36

management and our program management. This latter option is an integral part of the CPS (paras. 7880) while management has been actively looking at options to address the staff mix and deployment
issues.
131.
Looking forward, despite the risky operational environment, the demand for Bank Group
services, both from the GoP and other development partners remains strong. Hence the challenge will be
to creatively manage security risks in order to deliver the WBG program. As it has been over the past two
years, this will be a dynamic process of working with the government and other partners such as UN
Department of Safety and Security (UNDSS) to monitor risks and adjust our operational stance
accordingly. A significant challenge in this respect will be to find ways to enhance supervision in the
field while mitigating risks associated with staff travel. Risks associated with implementation of
operations in KP and FATA, where we are scaling up operations in response to requests from the
government and development partners, would be given particular attention and resources. The
supervision strategy will focus on various options to strengthen monitoring and evaluation of Bank
programs. These may include:
•

Operational visits by provincial project teams (headed by a senior Provincial Government
official) to Bank’s Islamabad Office for project implementation reviews.

•

Third-Party monitoring and supervision and promotion of sustained beneficiary participation in
projects in collaboration with civil society organizations (CSOs).

•

Project supervision by third-party technical and financial auditors as independent Monitoring
Agents, paid from Bank loan proceeds.

•

Use of the Global Distance Learning Network (GDLN) for project launch and supervision-related
activities.

•

Use of existing or newly-established video-conferencing (VC) facilities at provincial capitals to
facilitate frequent meetings and contacts between Project staff and Bank supervision teams in
Islamabad and Washington. Besides establishing IT connectivity, consideration will also be given
to the provision of VC equipment to project implementation entities to facilitate communications,
as part of project implementation and monitoring arrangements.

132.
The above are already relatively well-used practices in the program. Learning from examples in
Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal and other Bank regions, we will also seek to make greater use of
technology to increase the reliability of such “remote supervision” methods. These could include
GIS/GPS based monitoring systems including transmission of GPS-indexed photographs of project sites
and implementation activities through mobile or satellite phones.
B. Financing
133.
Based on Pakistan’s IDA 15 allocation of SDR 2.0 billion (including hard term IDA), annual
average IDA availability would be in the range of $1.0 billion. However since IDA 15 usage was
frontloaded with commitments of $1.6 billion in FY09, annual average IDA availability in FY10 and
FY11 is expected to be about $800 million per year. The priority lending program targets IDA lending of
$2.6 billion over FY10-12. Priorities for IDA financing include education, social protection and health as
well as PRSCs which would support cross-cutting structural reforms.
134.
The economic recovery now underway has opened up the prospect for resumption of IBRD
lending to Pakistan and the CPS envisages IBRD lending of up to $2.0 billion over the CPS period. The
priority lending program targets IBRD lending of $1.075 billion over FY 10-12. The actual volume of
IBRD lending would depend on Pakistan’s creditworthiness and IBRD’s ability to provide financing
given overall capital constraints. However, in the event macroeconomic reforms stay on track with
continued improvements in economic performance and creditworthiness this CPS proposes IBRD

37

investment lending averaging about $500 million per year within an overall IBRD lending envelope of
$2.0 billion. Maintenance of a sound macroeconomic framework (characterized by reserves equal to at
least 3 months of next year’s imports of goods and services and a stable or declining government debt to
GDP ratio) would be required for any IBRD lending. Lending amounts for FY11-FY13 are indicative
and dependent on IBRD's overall lending capacity. Priorities for IBRD lending are power, water, ports.
IBRD guarantees would also be used to support private investment in the energy sector.
135.
Development policy lending represents a smaller share of the proposed lending program than in
the last CAS which envisioned up to 50 percent of total lending taking the form of policy-based lending.
While PRSCs and potential province-level DPCs will be retained to support cross-cutting structural
reforms essential to supporting growth, sectoral policy-based loans are not proposed. During the CPS
period, IBRD resources will be devoted to investment lending. Overall, development policy lending
accounts for about one quarter of the priority lending program.
136.
Modulating Bank Support. Taken together, the modulation of IBRD and IDA financial support
over the CPS period would constitute an overall range of support of approximately $3.7-$6.0 billion.
Reflecting the need for flexibility, the IBRD/IDA financing envelop is not fully programmed beyond the
priority lending program. The actual level of financing would be guided by performance in improving
macroeconomic performance and (in the case of IBRD financing) creditworthiness. At the global level,
in assessing performance, critical consideration will be given to Government’s progress in improving key
macroeconomic indicators (particularly the tax/GDP ratio) while adhering to the guidelines in the Fiscal
Responsibility Law for poverty-related expenditure. Reaching the upper end of the range with IBRD
lending of up to $700 million in a single year within the overall envelope would require strong ongoing
progress to maintain and improve macroeconomic management. To manage IBRD’s exposure risk, no
fast disbursing IBRD lending is envisaged. In the event of a reversal in macroeconomic stabilization,
IDA lending would focus on sustaining ongoing programs in health, education and social protection, with
potentially additional operations for community driven development.
137.
IFC Financing Program. In the last CAS period (FY06-09) IFC committed investments in 48
projects with the total value of $958 million, greatly exceeding the target of $500-600 million. IFC's
current committed portfolio in Pakistan is $771 million in 40 projects, and the two largest sectors are
financial markets and power. During this period IFC also increased its advisory activities significantly
particularly in the areas MSME development including access to finance. In the upcoming CPS period
(FY10-14) IFC intends to invest between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion provided that the economic and
security situations do not deteriorate significantly. The emphasis would be in financial markets,
infrastructure, health and education and agribusiness. IFC is in the process of developing a programmatic
approach for advisory services in collaboration with other donors.
138.
Leveraging Other Resources. Beyond IBRD/IDA financing and IFC investments, the CPS will
seek to leverage other resources in support of the strategy. International experience in post-crisis
situations including Afghanistan and elsewhere has demonstrated the value of a coordinated framework
for pooling financial assistance under the overall leadership of the Government in line with Paris
Declaration principles of client ownership, alignment with a country’s own development strategy,
harmonization with country systems, and a focus on results. The Multi-donor Trust Fund for the
Northwest Border Region will provide such a framework. In education, ongoing education operations
tightly linked to provincial education sector reform programs in Sindh and Punjab provide a platform for
other partners’ financing including Canada, the EU, and UK DFID. The Bank has also played a critically
important role in helping the government to develop a new safety net institution and programs (BISP) that
are now serving as a platform that increasing numbers of donors, including UK DFID and US, are
supporting. Looking ahead, partners are considering the development of an MDTF to support public
financial management reform, a high priority for a several partners. Ongoing Bank-executed trust funds
to support Bank engagement on PRSCs and the water sector would also continue.

C. Analytical and Advisory Activities
139.
Provision of world-class knowledge is an integral part of the proposed strategy and analytical and
advisory services will continue to be used to support the policy dialogue on sector reforms and inform the
content of lending operations. Recent regional and corporate reviews of AAA work suggest there is room
for improvement. Specifically, client involvement and collaboration, including knowledge partnership
with local institutions has been seen as limited with the result that policy conclusions are seen as a donordriven agenda. In addition, much of the focus of AAA is on what to do with relatively little attention
given to involving practitioners and experts in sharing with clients, in practical ways, how to do things.
Finally dissemination efforts are uneven and not well planned.
140.
Addressing these issues will be a focus of a more strategically programmed and managed AAA
program during the CPS period. In order to use the Bank’s knowledge to leverage greater impact, the
AAA program will increase the use of programmatic non-lending technical assistance (NLTA). During
the past few years, NLTA combining short, on-demand policy notes with advisory support and capacity
building has proved to be valuable for supporting reform implementation, often in combination with or as
a precursor to, lending. Examples include the intensive NLTA support for implementation of enhanced
targeting of safety net program and in tax administration. Second, the Bank will increasingly use AAA to
work with local policy think tanks and academic institutions to build capacity for policy analysis and to
promote a more informed public policy debate. Finally dissemination will be more carefully planned with
a view to maximizing impact.

IFC will continue efforts to raise corporate governance standards in the private sector by working
with key market institutions such as the State Bank of Pakistan and the Securities Exchange Commission
of Pakistan to deliver training and disseminate knowledge. It will also strive to build local capacity to
deliver corporate governance services to the market. In order to enhance the performance and
competitiveness of Pakistani SMEs, IFC Advisory Services will be provided to SMEs to develop their
business skills and managerial capacities. IFC will capitalize on intermediaries and partners, such as local
training companies and large corporations, to expand its outreach to local SMEs. A specific target group

39

for these Advisory activities will be corporations in high growth sectors and sectors of strategic
importance to Pakistan’s socioeconomic development (e.g., the financial sector, telecommunications,
general manufacturing, health and education).
142.
Mainstreaming Gender. The 2005 Country Gender Assessment and the previous CAS note that
there are significant and entrenched obstacles to addressing gender imbalances in Pakistan and hence
policy interventions directed specifically at gender inequality in the public domain are needed. With a
view to increasing the focus on addressing gender across the entire Bank program, a gender review of the
portfolio was recently carried out. The review found that the overall performance of the Bank’s lending
portfolio in Pakistan can be rated as “moderately satisfactory” on mainstreaming gender issues at the
design and implementation stages with human development sectors—education, health and social
protection—performing better on mainstreaming gender issues, as there is a long history of analytical
work and technical assistance available to these sectors. Nevertheless the findings suggest there is room
for improvement in designing interventions across all sectors to address gender issues.
143.
The gender review reflects current practices and identifies areas of potential improvement for
integrating gender in sectors and projects. It recommends that sectors and project teams commit to
undertaking more focused gender analysis to more thoroughly and sustainably mainstream gender
concerns into sectors and projects. Practical, operationally relevant notes that guide each sector on how to
effectively integrate gender into its operations will support this analysis. Going forward the country team
will seek to reflect gender issues more directly in project design by: (i) undertaking gender policy
dialogue at the design stage for areas of activities where gender mainstreaming can be promoted, using
social assessments to inform the design of public sector reforms needed to promote recruitment of
women, and capacity building of client teams; (ii) taking account of overarching areas of weakness in
addressing gender issues, so that effective strategies can be identified and included in future (similar)
project preparation, and (iii) for operations where a direct interaction with community or beneficiary
groups is not expected, carrying out rapid gender assessments in order to ascertain that no aspect of
project design or implementation will have undesirable gender-related effects. Through its microfinance
investments, IFC has reached over 75,000 women borrowers in Pakistan, and this emphasis will continue
throughout the CAS period. IFC investments also will track gender disaggregated outcome indicators
(e.g., female jobs created, female students enrolled etc.). Similarly, IFC Advisory Services will continue
raising awareness among women to resolve disputes through mediation. In addition, IFC will also seek to
promote gender diversity in board of directors and senior management in the private sector.
144.
The country team also will begin to adopt new instruments for gender work, in addition to the
above measures to integrate gender into sector and project operations. Such instruments would include
any combination of the following: (i) a stand-alone project aimed at providing skills training to young
men and women who are unable to remain in school—with gender groups separated and skills types
deemed socially acceptable for each group—to enhance their chances of secure employment in growth
sectors of Pakistan’s economy; (ii) analytic work on gender issues in conflict-affected or other fragile
contexts, such as KP; and (iii) learning activities that build capacity of country team staff, managers and
clients to better incorporate gender concerns into their planning, policies and programs.
D. Partnerships
145.
The Government leads coordination of the policy dialogue and donor support in Pakistan and
Bank's program is coordinated with, and supported by, the efforts of other development partners. There
are limited donor coordination mechanisms, but a number of working committees support increased
collaboration and moving towards Paris Declaration goals. There is growing interest among development
partners to formulate and develop a joint Results Framework for our support to Pakistan as a tool to foster
better, simple, explicit and transparent donor co-ordination of and dialogue in support of Pakistan’s
development agenda. The Bank has agreed to take the lead on this initiative and will work with

40

Government and development partners to move this forward. Annex IV provides a more complete
discussion of partnership activities.
146.
The World Bank Group, under the leadership of the Government, will continue to increase
partnership efforts. This will include enhanced utilization of trust funds and ensuring that trust funds are
fully integrated into World Bank budgeting and strategy processes. Likewise the World Bank will
continue to carry out analytical work jointly with other development partners. IFC will leverage existing
partnerships and build new ones with partners such as IFC investment clients, large corporations, and
development organizations to expand its outreach and enhance its development impact. Partnerships with
Standard Chartered and the Aga Khan Foundation are already in place. During the previous CAS period,
joint analytical work was conducted with the UK Department for International Development, ADB, and
the United Nations. The World Bank and the IMF developed a strategic partnership for implementation
and monitoring the IMF Stand-By Arrangement whereby the World Bank led policy dialogue on tax
administration, electricity and social protection issues.
147.
The energy sector investments are a key priority in the CPS 2010-2013 and we are coordinating
our efforts with partners having significant engagement in this area. The Bank, jointly with ADB, is
leading the electricity pricing and sector financing dialogue linked to the IMF stand-by facility. In terms
of investments, ADB has Multi-Tranche Financing Facilities (MFF) focused on electricity transmission,
strengthening of distribution network (covering all eight DISCOs) and energy efficiency programs. We
have an ongoing project for electricity distribution and transmission improvement for four of the DISCOs,
mainly financing activities complimentary to the ADB’s operations. USAID is an emerging player with
major energy sector investments announced recently as part of their new assistance plan. They are
working on four new production plant refurbishments, including Tarbela to provide 450 additional
megawatts of power as part of the US$125 million energy program announced in October 2009. USAID
has also announced financing of some hydro projects and focusing on policy reform as well in order to
attract private investment in the sector. The Bank is in active discussion with the USAID team to ensure
synergies in assistance plans. Japan and KfW are other active players in the sector involved in specific
projects, mainly for power transmission. IDB is partnering with the Bank in the Central Asia - South Asia
(CASA) Electricity Import Project.
148.
The Bank has been actively engaged with the Government and other development partners in
helping strengthen social safety nets in Pakistan. Our reform initiative with the Benazir Income Support
Program (BISP) is serving as a viable platform to channel funds to support Government’s programs in
this area. To date, USAID has provided $85 m of direct budget support to BISP for cash transfers to
eligible beneficiaries identified under the Bank program. USAID has announced plans for more resources
for BISP under the ongoing strategic dialogue. DFID provided interim TA support of $2.5 m through a
trust fund to support technical work to prepare the Bank program of safety net support. DFID’s current
program has allocations for further work in this area. ADB’s Accelerated Economic Transformation
Program (AETP) window had a trigger on beneficiary targeting under BISP and the next tranches of the
program are expected to continue this focus. EU and AusAid are other interested partners currently in
contact with us with plans for possible financing of safety net activities. We will continue to share broad
contours and progress of safety net reforms with interested partners to facilitate complimentarity in
programming development resources.
149.
The education sector is another area with encouraging prospects for partnerships. The Bank is
working with DFID, EU, CIDA, to coordinate support around the medium term education sector reform
programs of Punjab and Sindh. USAID has shown interest in providing parallel resources to the program
as well. A similar initiative is being prepared for the KP. Financing such holistic sector programs has
reduced duplication of effort and encouraged each partner to support overall sector results and outcomes.
150.
Post-crisis support for KP is a CPS priority where the Bank from the very start has sought
enhanced coordination among all interested partners. The Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) for the

41

border region aims to facilitate harmonization of donor programs with government’s priorities as well as a
mechanism for enhanced donor coordination across sectors in line with strategic priorities agreed between
donors and government. The MDTF management committee will have representation from ADB, IDB
and UN. In terms of financial contributions, the Bank has signed the Administration Agreement with
DFID and Australia. Other likely contributors to the fund include US, EU, Denmark, and Turkey. The
strategic priorities and programming of the MDTF will be informed by the ongoing Post-Conflict Needs
Assessment (PCNA), which is being prepared in collaboration with the UN, EC, and ADB as key
partners.
151.
Given its strategic importance, Pakistan is a recipient of substantial donor resources linked to its
proximity and historic relationship to the conflict in Afghanistan as well as broader efforts to combat
violent extremism. Over the past two years, Pakistan’s partners have sought to increase their assistance
and to mobilize resources from the international community. In support of these efforts, the World Bank
co-organized with the Government of Japan the Tokyo Donors Conference in April 2009 and provides
technical support, as needed, to the "Friends of Democratic Pakistan" meetings. Government and donors
recognize that extraordinary assistance provided as a result of these efforts needs to be aligned with
Government’s overall poverty reduction vision. With this in mind, the Bank will seek to support GoP’s
efforts to reinvigorate the Pakistan Development Forum as a forum for fostering this alignment. The
Bank will also seek to create platforms, like MDTF, through which donors can channel additional
support. The Bank will also continue to explore options using SwAP-like instruments to allow donors to
support ongoing Government-owned programs such as those in education.
VI.

RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

152.
Several key risks for the implementation of the CPS surfaced clearly during the last CAS period.
These risks included macroeconomic slippage, security risks, and exogenous shocks and all three of these
risks materialized in ways that had significant impact on the CAS and WBG program.
153.
Political Risk. The FY 10-13 CPS will be implemented in the context of economic austerity and
other uncertainties. Hence there is a possibility that the economic stabilization program which entails
considerable short term economic pain for many Pakistanis could be reversed. This risk is mitigated by
the significant resources at stake under the IMF Stand-By Arrangement as well as the strong support from
a wide range of external donors and partners who have a significant stake in Pakistan’s success as a
stable, democratic country. At the same time, it will be important for the Bank and other partners to seek
to further mitigate this risk by building more ownership and buy-in by working to build understanding of,
and support for needed economic reforms across the political spectrum.
154.
Macroeconomic Risks. Although Pakistan has made progress in stabilizing the economy,
reviving growth of GDP, exports and foreign exchange reserves and reducing inflation and the current
account deficit, the fiscal situation remains vulnerable and inflation high. Partly owing to robust inflow
of workers’ remittances, the balance of payments situation has improved. However, there is a risk that
remittances will decline, especially from the countries of the Middle East, notwithstanding Government’s
strong efforts to provide incentives to foster greater flows. Also, exports continue to perform poorly and
the slow global recovery may continue depressing external demand as well as foreign inflows. Renewed
widening of external imbalances would need to be countered through greater efforts to control internal
imbalances. The IMF-supported Stand-By Arrangement supported by intensive dialogue with the Bank
will mitigate these risks by committing the authorities to fiscal and current account deficit targets.
155.
Conflict and Security. The success of the recent military operations in Swat and South
Waziristan has created some optimism about the possibility for a rapid end to the conflict. However
chances are good the conflict, which is primarily taking place in remote and difficult terrain, will prove to
be protracted. At the same time, the war in Afghanistan is growing in intensity. The conflict is likely to
have several spikes before long term stability and peace are achieved. Targeting programs in conflict

42

affected areas, as this CPS proposes, greatly increases the Bank’s exposure to such risks. Deterioration in
security across the entire country is also possible. In this context, attracting foreign investment will
remain a challenge and the conflict will continue to be a drain on the resources and attention of the
Government and people of Pakistan. The Bank Group will continue to monitor the overall security
situation and take action to mitigate security risks to staff. As discussed above, we will also work with
partners to find ways to carry out oversight in ways that reduce security risks. However, the strategy
proposed in this CPS is one that necessarily entails somewhat higher risks than the alternative of
restricting Bank Group engagement to only the most secure parts of the nation. However given the
necessity for Pakistan of addressing the conflict in order to achieve its development objective, the risk is
deemed warranted. In the context of the PCNA the Bank is increasing the use of conflict analysis in order
to better understand the development side drivers of the conflict.
156.
Management of the MDTF for the Northwest Border Areas poses reputational risks for the Bank.
One is a possible disconnect between donor expectations and the strategy and program that emerge from
the PCNA process. In addition, despite strong interest from Government and donors, MDTF start up
could be delayed by slow selection and preparation of projects and capacity constraints. Finally, success
in addressing longstanding development challenges in the region will require addressing governance
issues linked to conflict. However, such reforms may prove difficult and delay or impede MDTFfinanced operations, particularly in FATA. To mitigate these risks, the Bank will emphasize
communication and harmonized high-level dialogue with all stakeholders on the strategy setting process
in order to clarify linkages and strategic priorities and to build support for reforms needed to improve the
chances for success. Capacity building for counterparts is being provided through the PCNA process to
support implementation. Finally, in order to streamline MDTF management, trust fund governance
arrangements have been designed, based on best practices learned from other MDTFs, to give donors full
input on policy and strategic matters while day-to-day operational and administrative are left to the
Management Committee and Administrator.
157.
Implementation Risks. There are implementation risks on both the part of the Bank Group and
Pakistan. Weak capacity and an adverse investment climate remain serious challenges. These risks will
be mitigated at the project level with appropriate World Bank and IFC technical assistance, as well as by
support for cross-cutting reforms to improve the capacity and incentive frameworks faced by
counterparts. There are also fiduciary risks which impact the Bank’s program. The Bank Group will seek
to mitigate these risks through pro-active measures to reduce exposure of staff to security risks through
alternative means of supervision along with continued attention to capacity building and robust fiduciary
arrangements such as those involving third-party monitoring. On the Bank side, capacity constraints are
related to the Bank’s reduced presence in Pakistan. Efforts to mitigate implementation risks on the Bank
side will consist primarily of taking full advantage of the benefits of the Bank’s ongoing investment
lending reform initiative, in particular enhancing supervision and implementation support and making use
of simplified procedures where applicable. A strong and large IFC field presence in Pakistan has thus far
helped mitigate the implementation risks associated with security and macroeconomic vulnerabilities, and
IFC was able to deliver a robust program even in the past difficult fiscal year. IFC expects to continue to
have a strong field presence in Pakistan in the coming CAS period.
158.
Overall CPS Program Design and Risk Management. The design of the program under the CPS
has three features that minimize risks for the Bank engagement. First, Bank support for economic
management reforms is firmly dependent on government making satisfactory progress in meeting key
reform milestones. Second, for the program centered on HD outcomes (comprising about 30 percent of
Bank priority program) disbursements by the Bank will depend on progress made by government in
meeting results agreed under the program. Finally, expansion of the support under CPS beyond the
priority program will depend on progress made in meeting key targets under the most critical components
of the program.

Introduction

1.
This CAS Completion Report (CASCR) assesses the effectiveness of the FY06-09 World Bank
Group Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the Islamic Republic of Pakistan (Report Number 35718PAK, dated April 4, 2006). It is based upon portfolio implementation performance reports,
Implementation Status Reports and Aide Memoires for each project during the CAS period;
Implementation Completion Reports for projects completed during the CAS period and IEG reviews of
those reports; QAG reviews; interviews with client counterparts at federal and provincial levels and
representatives of civil society; and interviews with Country Team members, past and present.
2.
The CAS specifies the outcomes that would support the Government’s long term development
goals, as well as targets, intermediate indicators, and indicators used to measure the outcomes, all of
which facilitate the task of assessing the achievement of results.
II.

Government’s Strategic Goals (PRSP 2003 and Medium Term Development Framework
2005-2010)

3.
The CAS was based upon the Government’s strategic goals as articulated in the 2003 PRSP and
refinements to the PRSP embodied in the 2005-2010 Medium Term Development Framework (MTDF).
The new PRSP, which was prepared shortly after the preparation of the CAS, did not significantly change
the Government’s strategic objectives. The 2003 PRSP had four pillars:
i.

ii.

iii.

iv.

III.

Accelerating economic growth while maintaining macroeconomic stability: the strategy
aimed to expand the role of the private sector by strengthening the enabling role of
government.
Improving governance: key elements included accelerating civil service reform, furthering
devolution, improving access to justice, police reforms, and accelerating improvements in
public procurement and financial management.
Investing in human capital: the PRSP included increased allocations for education, water and
sanitation, rural infrastructure and health, as well as organizational reforms in human
development ministries and agencies.
Targeting the poor and vulnerable: The PRSP included social protection programs to improve
the welfare of the poor and vulnerable groups.

World Bank Strategic Objectives and CAS Outcomes (FY06-09)

4.
The FY06-09 CAS was well aligned with the Government’s strategic goals. Pillar 1 of the CAS,
Sustaining High and Broad-based Growth and Improving Competitiveness, is aligned with the PRSP’s

Annex II
Page 2 of 40

Pillar 1, Accelerating Economic Growth While Maintaining Macroeconomic Stability, Pillar 3 links with
the PRSP’s Pillar 4, Targeting the Poor and the Vulnerable, while Pillar 2 is aligned with the PRSP’s
Pillar’s 2 and 3, Improving Governance and Investing in Human Capital. The CAS includes a clear results
framework with measurable indicators to guide program planning, country performance monitoring and
portfolio performance monitoring. The results framework includes 3 pillars, 11 objectives, 64 outcome
indicators, and 79 intermediate indicators.
5.
CAS Context and Relevance. The overall CAS objective of sustaining growth and accelerating
poverty reduction was relevant and well aligned with the Government’s own program. The previous CAS
period had seen Pakistan’s recovery from economic crisis followed by rapid growth and significant
progress in poverty reduction. GDP growth reached 8.4% in FY04/05 and, despite the challenges posed
by the October 2005 earthquake, was expected to remain above 6%. Seeking to capitalize on this
relatively favorable environment, the CAS was designed to support an ambitious program of second
generation reforms and accelerated infrastructure investment to put Pakistan on a higher growth trajectory
over the medium term. This proved overly optimistic.
6.
The generally favorable country context that prevailed at the time the CAS was prepared began to
deteriorate markedly beginning in 2007. Positive economic prospects gave way to large imbalances
driven by rapidly rising oil prices followed in rapid succession by the global food and financial crises.
Concurrently, sound macroeconomic management and policy performance were undermined by a hotly
contested political transition. A prolonged period of political confrontation, constitutional crisis and
uncertainty undermined Government’s ability to meet growing economic challenges. Domestic and
international security challenges, while not new, reached crisis proportions during the CAS period,
imposing large human and financial costs while seriously eroding investor confidence. This rapidly
changing context meant that the challenge for the country team was to shift the focus to addressing near
term challenges while at the same time sustaining the focus on longer term challenges and adapting to
meet the priorities of the new government that came to power during the CAS period
IV.

Results Assessment

7.
Attachment 1 provides a detailed analysis of CAS progress and World Bank Group performance
against the results framework. This section summarizes these findings by pillar and outcome.
Pillar 1: Sustaining High and Broad-based Growth and Improving Competitiveness
8.
Strengthen macroeconomic management and allocation of resources. Maintaining the hardwon benefits of macroeconomic stability was critical to sustaining growth. When the CAS was prepared,
recent performance had been promising in terms of growth but inflationary pressures were growing, ad
hoc and inconsistent tax policy changes were constraining revenue mobilization and implementation of
tax administration reforms was at an early stage. Losses of state-owned enterprises continued to be a drain
on the budget. The CAS program in this goal area set out to strengthen tax policy and administration,
improve debt management and public expenditure management.
9.
The Bank contributed to progress in strengthening macroeconomic management and the
allocation of resources through the Poverty Reduction Strategy Credits (PRSCs) II and III and through

Annex II
Page 3 of 40

support for fiscal reforms included in a series of provincial DPCs. Later, to assist in addressing the urgent
need for stabilization, the 2009 Poverty Reduction and Economic Support Operation (PRESO, 46685PAK), prepared in close consultation with the IMF, helped address critical revenue and expenditure
issues. Improved tax administration was supported through The Tax Administration Project (077306PAK) that began during the previous CAS and has been extended to 2011. Although it is expected that the
project will eventually achieve its development objective, the project struggled with moderately
satisfactory implementation due in part to strong opposition to needed organization changes in the Federal
Bureau of revenue. The project is now being restructured with intensive supervision and non-lending
technical assistance to revitalize the reform program. The project also suffered from delays in the design
and implementation of IT systems. On the positive side, the tax policy reform ESW and NLTA dialogue
– given considerable urgency by the macro crisis – have led to adoption of a plan to introduce a VAT
beginning in FY2011. In addition, creation of large and medium taxpayers’ units appears to have paid off
with a significant decline in businesses identifying tax administration as a major impediment in the most
recent investment climate assessment. 1 Nevertheless, poor tax mobilization remains one of the key
macroeconomic issues. Total revenue actually fell from a very low 14.9 per cent of GDP in 2007 to 14.3
per cent in 2008.
10.
These operations were underpinned by AAA including a Tax Policy Report, the Pakistan Export
and Growth report, Trade Policy Notes, a Pakistan Access to Finance Study, a Labor Market Study, and
the Pakistan Investment Climate Assessment. AAA was also carried out at the provincial level to include
the Sindh Economic Report, the Balochistan Economic Report, NWFP Growth Policy Notes, and the
Northern Areas Economic Report.
11.
Despite progress during the first two years of the CAS period, overall the World Bank did not
achieve its objectives for this goal. During the first half of the CAS period, macroeconomic performance
continued to be good. Growth in FY06 -07 averaged 6% of GDP and the debt/GDP ratio continued to
fall. The poverty headcount fell, reaching 17 percent in the 2007-08 household survey compared with
22% in 2005-06. 2 However, the macroeconomic situation deteriorated substantially during the latter half
of the CAS period, with increasing inflation, widening fiscal and current accounts and slowing economic
growth. Much of this can be attributed to external factors, such as exogenous oil and commodity price
shocks, the worldwide financial and economic crisis, political and security instability, and the
Government’s inability to take the steps necessary to undertake needed adjustments in energy pricing and
revenue mobilization. As a result federal subsidies increased from 1.2 per cent of GDP in 2007 to 3.8 per
cent of GDP in 2008, with the budget deficit increasing from 4.3 per cent of GDP to 7.4 per cent. Foreign
reserves declined rapidly due to the large current account deficit, a reduction in net capital inflows and an
inadequate adjustment of the exchange rate. GDP growth, which peaked at about 9 per cent in FY 2004,
is expected to be around 3 per cent for 2009/10.
12.
The CAS identified macroeconomic slippage as a key risk and envisioned intensified dialogue on
macroeconomic policy underpinned by annual PRSCs. However, the PRSC series could not be delivered,
as the Government was increasingly distracted by internal political turmoil which sapped reform
1

Poverty did rise in the last quarter of PSLM 2007-08 survey period (April – June 2008) and can be expected to
have risen further after the survey period as the full impact of food and fuel crises and the breakout of the global
financial crisis came after the PSLM 07-08 was completed
2

Annex II

momentum. Worsening security conditions also contributed to a decline in investor and business
confidence as well as increased security-related expenditure which worsened the fiscal situation. In
response, the World Bank stepped up engagement on macroeconomic policy and deepened cooperation
with the IMF. By the end of the CAS period, the authorities had entered into a Stand By Arrangement
with the IMF, with the World Bank taking the lead in policy dialogue on key structural reforms of tax
administration, power sector reform and safety nets. Thus, rather than helping to sustain high growth as
originally envisioned, the focus of the Bank’s work shifted to a more short-term focus on stabilization.
13.
Increased diversification and exports in agriculture. Although the Government had made
progress in liberalization in the sector a priority during the previous CAS period, it was still heavily
involved in the procurement of local production; and factor markets including land, water and credit still
did not function well. The World Bank set out to support the preparation of an integrated rural strategy,
as well as analysis related to adapting technologies for rain-fed areas and livestock, and policy and
institutional reforms beginning with land records registration in Punjab. AAA included the Pakistan
Rural Growth and Poverty Reduction Report (which included a rural strategy). The Punjab Land Records
Management and Information Systems Project suffered substantial delays, mainly because of weaknesses
in project management capacity and delays in software development, as well as an increase in the scope
of the project. The Sindh On-Farm Water Management Project (078997-PAK, 2004-2009) has been rated
only moderately satisfactory due to capacity and environmental problems. The NWFP On Farm Water
Management Project also aimed to support improvements in agricultural productivity.
14.
Irrigation and Drainage. Pakistan’s extensive irrigation system, one of the largest in the world
is under stress as a result of growing demand, deteriorating infrastructure and poor governance. The
World Bank strategy reflected a conclusion that weak performance of the Pakistan irrigation and drainage
sector reflects major underlying institutional weaknesses. The Bank set out to support a combination of
institutional reforms and investments including the rehabilitation of critical assets; capacity development
at provincial and federal levels; improvements in the quality, efficiency and accountability with which
irrigation services are delivered; and investment in on-farm services. Reforms included decentralization
of irrigation service from large public entities to commercially oriented area water boards. The Bank
provided technical assistance for a range of water related issues, including financing, storage and
hydrology through the Water Resources Capacity Building Project (WCAP –P 110099, 2009). Other
operations included the Sindh Water Sector Improvement Phase I Project (2008), the Balochistan Small
Scale Irrigation Project (2008), the Punjab Irrigation DPLs (2006, 2007), and the Taunsa Barrage
Emergency Rehabilitation and Modernization Project (towards the end of the previous CAS, 2005). The
NWFP On-Farm Water Management Project (2007) achieved its objectives but concern was expressed
about the potential unsustainability of the farmers’ organizations. The operations were supported by
AAA including the Pakistan Country Water Resources Assistance Strategy (34081-PAK, 2005) and a
Punjab Water Supply and Sanitation report (P101686, 2007).
15.
Performance against this goal has been mixed. The irrigation governance and management
agenda made good progress under the Punjab Irrigation DPL series. Positive results include a system of
Asset Management Planning for irrigation; a new groundwater management policy; and the transfer of
public sector managed tubewells to farmers. Under the program three hundred water users associations
have been established, covering some 1.5 million hectares of land. The Sindh project’s rating was reduced
to unsatisfactory in December 2008. The Balochistan Small-Scale Irrigation project started slowly

Annex II
Page 5 of 40

because preparatory action had to be undertaken after the project became effective. Rehabilitation of the
Taunsa Barrage was completed ahead of schedule, although the project encountered some problems in
addressing community concerns related to re-settlement and livelihood assistance activities. Progress
with the Water Sector Capacity Building Project has been moderately satisfactory, the main problem
being technical assistance components, which have been hampered by a fragmented approach to training.
16.
Improving the business environment for trade and investment. Policy makers were focusing on
strengthening international competitiveness through rising productivity including improving economic
governance, fostering flexibility in factor markets and making it easier for entrepreneurs to do business.
The World Bank set out to support these policies through analytical work, including the Pakistan Export
Growth and Competitiveness Report (35499-PK, 2006) and capacity building. Other AAA included the
Pakistan Value Chain Study, a Labor Market Study and an Investment Climate Assessment.
17.
The CAS targeted enhanced labor market flexibility as a key goal. This was to be achieved
through reforms to existing labor laws. With PRSC support, Government made significant progress in
revising labor legislation to reduce compliance costs for businesses and to increase labor force
participation, particularly for females. Further reforms were targeted through PRESO with submission to
Parliament of a new Employment and Service Condition Act aimed at consolidating related laws
governing employment conditions. This Act remains pending with Parliament.
18.
The CAS also targeted a strengthened legal framework for competition through restructuring of
the Monopoly Control Authority. This was largely achieved as a new competition policy framework was
approved and an independent Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) created in November 2007.
Significant progress has been made to establish the framework and operationalize CCP.
19.
One of the key objectives of the Poverty Reduction and Economic Support Operation (46685-PK,
2009) was to enhance competitiveness through reducing barriers to business entry and exit and
strengthening the financial sector. The operation was designed to build upon an extensive program of
technical assistance by the Bank since 2006, including the above mentioned report. Under PRESO,
Government rolled out an electronic platform for business registration with the aim of further simplifying
procedures. The Second Trade and Transport Facilitation Project was approved by the Board in May
2009.
20.
IFC’s activities related to trade finance were successful during the CAS period, particularly after
the introduction of the Global Trade Finance Program to local banks in 2006. An increasing number of
banks – up to 11 in FY09 - made use of IFC’s trade finance guarantees. It became even more important
after the global economic crisis affected Pakistan with a total of $223.9 million in guarantees in FY09
21.
Notwithstanding progress in some of the structural reform areas targeted by the CAS, the overall
business environment worsened due to the deteriorating macroeconomic situation and increasing
distortions arising from rapidly rising price subsidies. The increasing political uncertainty and instability
also reduced incentives for domestic as well as foreign investors.
22.
Improving Delivery and Efficiency of Infrastructure Services. Recognizing that poor
infrastructure represented a serious constraint to growth and investment, the CAS targeted a significant

Annex II
Page 6 of 40

share of lending toward the water, transport, urban and energy sectors. In general, however, the CAS
emphasized policy reforms (e.g., privatization, private sector participation, and institution building)
supported through DPLs over large infrastructure investment projects which, to the extent they were
envisioned, were planned for the latter part of the CAS period. Investment projects were expected to be
approved once reforms had advanced sufficiently to make public investment effective. The CAS also
supported some investment operations in key sectors, including power, telecommunications, oil and gas
and transport. AAA included a Transport Competitiveness Report (P093998, 2006), an Infrastructure
Implementation Capacity Assessment (P100848, 2007), and the Public Private Partnership policy note
(P087007, 2007). Projects included the Electricity Transmission and Distribution Project (2008-2012);
and the previous CAS’s National Highway Rehabilitation-Additional Financing (010556-PAK, 20032009). Non lending technical assistance was provided (by the Public Private Infrastructure Advisory
Facility) to develop and design a universal access program for mobile telephony and broadband. IFC set
out to support investment in power and distribution (Karachi Electric Supply Company and Engro
Power), the development of country’s gas and petrochemical resources (Dewan Petroleum and Engro
polymer), the expansion of container terminals (Pakistan International Container Terminal) and private
telecommunications sector (Paktel). IFC was also engaged in advisory services in public private
partnership (PPP) development, supporting the GOP’s regulatory bodies and its infrastructure
privatization sector.
23.
Progress on corporatization and improved performance in the power sector was mixed.
Implementation of the Electricity Transmission and Distribution Project has been very slow due to routine
project matters. Nevertheless, project ISRs indicate steady reductions in technical and commercial losses
in the participating power distribution companies. However these achievements were overshadowed by a
financial crisis in the sector caused by Government’s inability to adjust tariffs in response to increasing
power generations costs (principally due to rising oil prices). This was a major contributor to the fiscal
crisis in 2008/09. In addition, lack of investment in generation capacity led to major shortfalls in power.
24.
In transport, the CAS envisioned a series of DPLs in support of the Government’s National Trade
Corridor initiative as well as ongoing implementation of the of The National Highways Rehabilitation
project which was extended with additional financing. However, progress in implementing the NTC
reform agenda proceeded more slowly than planned, in part due to the ambitiousness of the targeted
reforms and in part due to the change in Government. For example, there was negligible progress in
corporatizing Pakistan Railways or establishing a sustainable financing mechanism for the National
Highway Authority. The NHA project was rated as “satisfactory” in the most recent ISR with the
program on track to meet its development objectives. Major achievements include: the road network in
poor/very poor condition reduced from 49% to 39.5% against an end of project target of 35%; travel time
on N-5 reduced by 9% reaching the end of project target of 10%; and fatalities on N-5 decreased by 44%.
Problems included higher prices than anticipated, shortages of materials, and a lack of timely availability
of Government counterpart funds.
25.
Improving access to market-based finance. The Bank Group set out to support reforms that
would deepen the financial sector and lengthen instruments. This built on earlier reforms that had
transformed a mainly state-owned and weak banking system into a healthier, market based system, but
with some financial institutions still under government control, and with large segments of the economy

Annex II
Page 7 of 40

without access to formal credit. The Pakistan Access to Finance Report (P100850) and the Pakistan
Investment Climate Assessment (P098872, 2009) were carried out towards the end of the CAS period.
26.
While, Pakistan’s financial system grew significantly over the CAS period, total financial assets
of 150 percent of GDP are far below those of countries like China (543 percent), India (298 percent of
GDP), and Thailand (211 percent). In spite of recent achievements, access to financial services remains
quite limited in Pakistan. The predominant share of the financial system, the banking sector, remains
focused on large enterprise lending, with an increasing interest in consumer financing (though still on a
very small scale), to the relative neglect of SMEs, rural areas, microfinance, and the poor.
27.
Reform of the National Savings Scheme (NSS) moved forward modestly. The modernization and
automation of information technology systems for the (NSS) began in 2009 and will be rolled out
successively at NSS outlets across Pakistan over the coming years. The authorities also took actions in
2008 and 2009 to improve the forecasting of debt service on NSS instruments. In the context of PRESO,
the authorities agreed to develop a medium-term debt management strategy, but this will not be
undertaken until 2010.
28.
IFC’s investment funded finance related advisory services under the PEP-MENA program
including: strengthening financial markets and expanding access to finance for MSME’s; improving
corporate governance practices; and in privatization and public private partnership (PPP) development,
supporting the GOP’s regularity bodies and its infrastructure privatization efforts. IFC was not successful
in its training and advisory project for the housing sector which was to work with individual banks to
improve internal credit and risk systems, policies and procedures to promote affordable housing finance,
largely because the Government did not take the steps necessary to reorganize and reorient the House
Building Finance Company.
29.
Assessment of Pillar 1: The overall objective of this pillar, high and broad-based growth, was
not achieved, despite a strong program of lending, AAA, investment and an active policy dialogue. The
economy had deteriorated by the end of the CAS period, although the macroeconomic indicators were
beginning to deteriorate even as the CAS began to be implemented. Key macroeconomic indicators are
worse now than they were in 2006. The principal reason for this was Government’s inability to undertake
reforms on taxes, expenditure, and commodity pricing needed to maintain fiscal and economic stability
with growth. While there was progress in strengthening institutions of economic management and some
progress in areas such as irrigation institutional management, competition policy, technical losses in
power, this progress was overshadowed by the Government’s focus on elections, the new Government’s
need to win broad-based political support and the rising security threats to the nation. Much of the
ambitious policy-based lending program for infrastructure development envisioned in the CAS had to be
deferred as project preparation slowed during the political transition and creditworthiness considerations
eliminated Pakistan’s access to IBRD financing.
30.
In retrospect, while they were cited in the CAS, the risks related to policy reversals due to
political changes and macroeconomic slippages were underestimated. The Fiscal Responsibility and Debt
Limitation Law, which was seen as significantly mitigating the risk of the latter, proved ineffective in
ensuring policy makers took action to address rising economic imbalances. The lack of ownership for

Annex II
Page 8 of 40

energy pricing reforms introduced in a time of more stable energy prices was also not appreciated,
contributing to the rapid deterioration in macroeconomic performance.
Pillar 2: Strengthened Governance and Service Delivery
31.
Greater efficiency, transparency, and accountability in the use of public resources. Improving
governance was included in almost every operation in the CAS. There were governance elements, which
set out to improve policy making and implementation, accountability and transparency, in sectoral
projects, DPCs and DPLs, and the PRSCs at both provincial and federal levels. The Bank continued to
support public financial management reforms begun in 1996 including strengthening legislative oversight;
improving accounting and auditing; introducing better corporate governance; and additional analytical
support to assist in defining the agenda for further reforms.
32.
Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Assessments were carried out for each
of the provinces and the Federal Government. The principal instrument for implementing reforms in
accounting and auditing was the Second Improvement to Financial Reporting and Accounting (PIFRA II,
2005) project which has made satisfactory progress. The accounting and auditing goals were achieved at
the federal and provincial levels, to be extended to the districts in 2009. Auditing, which used to be on a
transaction basis is now in accordance with international risk-based practice. The budget process too has
been improved with the introduction of a medium term perspective. Progress with legislative oversight,
through capacity building for the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), was not satisfactory, although the
post-election PAC appears to be much more serious about its responsibilities. Procurement capacity
improvements were supported through procurement assessments, capacity building under the PSCB
project, the PRSCs, the DPC s and DPLs, and the sectoral projects. More progress is needed before
procurement reaches the standards achieved in accounting and auditing.
33.
Enhanced capacity for service delivery and public sector management. Goals under this
objective were to include improvements in management of the civil service (merit-based recruitment and
promotion, structural changes to support devolution, further pay and pension reforms, and capacity
building through effective national and international training) and reforms to increase the accountability
and efficiency of local governments. Pakistan’s devolution initiative was seen as a cornerstone of the
government’s strategy for improving service delivery by making the public sector more accountable to
citizens and more efficient at delivering basic services.
34.
With respect to civil service reforms, The Public Sector Capacity Building Project (3904-PAK,
2004) and PRSCs were to be the main operations. Preparation of a civil service reform agenda and
creation of a civil service reform unit represented a promising start along with the creation of a high level
National Commission on Governance Reforms. However those proposals stalled. As a result the planned
District Service and National Executive Service were not created and no progress was made in reducing
pay compression. Nevertheless, progress was made on less ambitious reforms to improve recruitment by
the Federal Public Service Commission by revamping the testing process and improving capacity of the
FPSC itself. On balance, civil service reform efforts yielded negligible results.
35.
At the end of 2008, the PSCB project was rated only moderately satisfactory. The ISR stated that
there was a “need for broader civil service measures to complement professional development and

Annex II
Page 9 of 40

capacity building, including pay and pensions, recruitment and training.” It was recommended that the
implementation unit be more active in facilitation, coordination and fiduciary oversight. On the positive
side, professional development of mid-level civil servants proceeded on schedule. However, the project’s
design, which focused heavily on training and analytical outputs, reduced its impact on public sector
performance. The PRSCs and the sectoral and provincial DPCs and DPLs also set out to improve service
delivery, with some success.
36.
Although the sectoral DPLs and DPCs supported sub-federal level governance, little support was
given to supporting capacity building at the local level. One problem was that, despite legislative changes
and the election of local councils, staff continued to report to provincial governments and the future of the
local government system is uncertain – the ambitious decentralization reforms introduced in 2001 were
revisited and in some cases reversed. Several projects including the Punjab Municipal Services
Improvement Project and the NWFP and AJK CIP projects had the dual objectives of strengthening and
supporting the local government system while also supporting the delivery of community infrastructure.
Under the NWFP CIP project 699 Citizen Community Boards (CCBs) have been registered in nearly all
Tehsil Municipal Authorities.
37.
Improved municipal service delivery. Following the swearing in of 6,400 newly elected local
governments in 2005, the Bank’s support for devolution was to include analytical work on roles and
responsibilities under the new devolved framework, citizen participation, and capacity building. The CAS
also set out to support the Government’s urban agenda by helping to address weaknesses in policies and
administrative structures that undermine service delivery in cities. A series of DPLs was envisioned to
support policy reforms to address (i) improved coordination and consistency of urban planning and land
management; (ii) municipal finance; and (iii) infrastructure service delivery. However the DPL series
was not delivered as planned. The Punjab Municipal Services Improvement Project (7380-PAK, 2006)
aimed to build capacity and provides grants for investments to improve service delivery in small
municipalities. The project has suffered from slow implementation. Issues included frequent staff
turnover, inadequate allocations for operations and maintenance, and jurisdictional problems. Capacity
constraints were severe, exacerbated by the uncertainty associated with the political transition.
38.
Assessment of Pillar 2: The overall goal to strengthen governance and service delivery was
partially achieved. Good progress on financial reporting and accounting were offset by a lack of progress
in public sector management and a failure to deliver planned lending in the urban and local governance
sectors. The success of PIFRA II and the significant AAA on federal and provincial PEFA assessments
sets the stage for continued progress in public financial management, but entry points and champions will
be needed for both public sector reform and local government strengthening. Ownership of the local
government reforms turned out to be weaker than anticipated.
Pillar 3: Improving Lives and Protecting the Vulnerable
39.
Improved delivery of health and education services. Performance in the education sector,
although improving, had been handicapped by inadequate resources, over-centralization, and weak public
sector management. The Bank planned to continue its focus at the provincial level through development
policy credits with annual tranches linked to outcomes in Sindh, Punjab and NWFP, and sector
investment projects in Balochistan. With slow progress in improving health outcomes for the poor, the

Annex II
Page 10 of 40

CAS concentrated on encouraging a government focus on public health functions, expanding access to
primary health care and family planning, supporting increases in overall health expenditure, and piloting
new approaches to heath service delivery. System reforms would be supported through a series of
provincial development policy credits. The Bank also planned to help the Government identify its
priority interventions in environmental management, including in water and sanitation.
40.
The educational DPCs generally achieved their policy objectives. The Punjab Education Sector
DPC I, which began under the previous CAS and ended during this one, exceeded many of its indicators,
met most of the others, and only fell short for a few, resulting in a satisfactory operation according to the
ICR. Three more DPCs followed. The first three Punjab Education Development Policy Credits were
rated as satisfactory, exceeding the primary school enrolment outcome indicators and just falling short for
secondary education. Punjab Education DPCs II and III outcomes were rated satisfactory by IEG. Sindh
too had a DPC, to be followed, as was Punjab IV, by a three year Education Sector Project. Balochistan’s
Education Support Project (4203-PAK, 2006-2011) has made satisfactory implementation progress. The
National Educational Assessment Project (3775-PAK), jointly funded by DFID, which began in 2003 and
closed in June 2009, started slowly but eventually made satisfactory progress in achieving its
development objective of ensuring that assessment mechanisms and instruments in place although more
support will be required to strengthen the capacity and institutionalize assessments. AAA included a
study of Higher Education Policy, which underpins the Higher Education Support Program which was
approved by the Board in September 2009.
41.
While the Punjab education DPCs were successful in achieving many critical policy and
institutional reforms, there was modest improvement into learning outcomes during this period. While
several institutional reforms to strengthen quality were put in place, these did not translate to improved
learning outcomes during the CAS period. The program responded to changing needs by moving from a
program built around the policy reforms promoted by single tranche provincial DPCs to slightly longer
term sectoral programs, also at the provincial level, that focused on more operational issues.
42.
In health, the CAS envisioned support at the federal level in communicable disease prevention
programs (polio and the ongoing HIV/AIDS project), health surveillance and maternal and child health
(through support to the Lady Health Worker (LHW) program) During the CAS two health sector
operations were approved along with the province-level HD DPC in NWFP. The PRSC also included
health triggers, one of the prior actions for health - consolidated health expenditures for 2005/06 to be
consistent with the targets set out in the PRSP – was not met, despite a good increase in expenditures.
43.
The HIV/AIDS Prevention Project (2003-2009) has institutionalized HIV/AIDS service delivery
through the private sector with public sector financing and has been able to stabilize HIV prevalence
where service delivery interventions have been operationalized. However, the project continues to suffer
from inadequate procurement and financial management staffing and is rated as moderately satisfactory.
The Polio Eradication II Project including supplementary financing, which closed in 2007, achieved its
development objective in terms of coverage but the transmission of polio virus persisted due to security
situation in different parts of Pakistan The health surveillance and LHW projects did not proceed as
Government priorities shifted.

Annex II
Page 11 of 40

44.
Reduced vulnerability and improved livelihoods for poor communities through effective safety
nets, targeted interventions, and hazard risk management. At 0.5 per cent of GDP, expenditure on
social safety nets programs is lower in Pakistan than in most other developing countries. The targeted
CAS outcomes included development of a social protection policy, piloting of conditional cash transfers,
development of a targeting mechanisms and increased spending on poverty-targeted safety nets. The
Bank’s support for social safety nets was planned to include assistance to the chronic poor (widowed,
disabled and elderly), help for the poor to escape poverty, and support for families and individuals to cope
with seasonal shock and natural disasters. The Bank also set out to buttress support for social security.
Support would be provided through PRSCs, a stand-alone social protection operation, assistance for
persons with disabilities in earthquake affected areas, and social protection components in the provincial
DPCs and emergency operations. In 2007 the Bank prepared the Pakistan Social Safety Net Report.
45.
While these interventions were generally on track the CAS agenda was overtaken by events as the
new government that came to power in late 2008 had an ambitious agenda for scaling up social protection
under a new Benazir Income Support Program. The Bank responded with rapid TA and lending
(approved in the first month of FY 10) to help Government design and roll-out a dramatically expanded
cash transfer program for poor families using a proxy mean test targeting mechanism. With this, a key
CAS goal was achieved - expanded spending on safety nets using an objective targeting mechanisms
developed with Bank support.
46.
Improved livelihoods and services for poor communities and drought prone areas. The CAS
targeted increased community participation in local infrastructure and services and an increase in
microcredit borrowers. These outcomes were to be supported by the ongoing PPAF and CIP projects.
The ICR for the Second Poverty Alleviation Project, which became effective in 2004, noted poorly
defined PDO indicators, while the belatedly established M&E system focused on outputs rather than
outcomes. This partly reflects the evolution of PPAF focused on micro-finance provision and
strengthening civil society to a broader livelihoods focus. The PDO of the recently approved PPAF III
improves the focus on outcomes and impact. Implementation had been affected by the earthquake in
2005, and deterioration in the macroeconomic and security situations. However, the ICR concludes that
the development objectives have been largely achieved and that the project has been highly satisfactory.
The project met or exceeded most of its indicators. It also managed to adapt successfully to changes in
financing and the external environment, including four additional finance credits -- two in support of
earthquake relief and rehabilitation and the other additional finance to strengthen the approach to social
mobilization in the poorest areas of Pakistan.
47.
The AJK Community Infrastructure Project (3689-PAK, 2002-2008) has made moderately
satisfactory implementation progress, although it is thought that stronger follow up on the project is
required by the Government and market based salaries need to be paid to attract well qualified staff.
Project management has suffered from frequent changes in staffing. The Second NWFP Community
Infrastructure Project made satisfactory progress despite the deteriorating security environment in the
province and the increased difficulty in tackling gender and social issues. The project also experienced
frequent changes in staff.
48.
Reducing Pakistan’s vulnerability to natural disasters. Close to the end of the previous CAS,
donors including the World Bank, pledged $6.5 billion for earthquake relief. Beginning with the ongoing

Annex II
Page 12 of 40

Earthquake Recovery Credit, the Bank planned to assist Pakistan to develop a hazard risk management
strategy. The Bank also planned to work with the Government and other partners to develop capacity to
carry out the strategy and to integrate risk management into development programs.
49.
Following an Earthquake Damage and Needs Assessment prepared by the World Bank, the Asian
Development Bank and other partners in 2005, the World Bank prepared the Earthquake Emergency
Recovery Project (P09910, 2006). This project was rated satisfactory in terms of its development
objective and highly successful in terms of implementation performance. The project’s housing
reconstruction, livelihood support and import financing components were fully disbursed and pilot
projects in disaster relief management were launched. A total of $238 million Additional finance was
provided to the PPAF for earthquake relief and rehabilitation, which leveraged an additional US$26
million from IFAD. This project had strong community participation in reconstruction and was rated
satisfactory. Earthquake additional finance was also provided to the GoNWFP, which was linked to the
NWFP OFWMP. AAA included the Emergency Cyclone Damage and Needs Assessment.
50.
The GEF Protected Area Management Project, which began in 2001, is not referred to in the
Results Framework, and is due to close in 2009, was successfully implemented in AJK and NWFP, but
suffered from staffing, financial management and disbursement problems in Balochistan. AAA included
a Strategic Country Environmental Assessment in 2006 which highlighted the high costs to the Pakistan
economy (at least 6% of GDP) of environmental degradation and helped solidify a consensus on the need
for a more active response. This has laid the groundwork for future work in the upcoming CAS.
51.
Assessment of Pillar 3: World Bank Group performance under Pillar III was very good, although
progress was limited in some areas. The Earthquake Recovery Project was considered best practice and
has been used as global best practice, while in education programs generally met their development
objectives and there was a strategic shift to results based approaches in Sindh and Punjab. The Bank’s
social protection work scaled up strongly towards the end of the CAS with introduction of the Benazir
Income Support Program and support to PPAF was improved through a stronger focus on outcomes and
impact.
V.

World Bank Performance – Portfolio Management

Lending
52.
Lending. During the CAS period 12 national projects, 8 provincial DPLs or DPCs, 7 sectoral
provincial projects, and two PRSCs were approved. Budget support mainly through DPCs accounted for
about half of lending in the early years of the CAS. There was no budget support in 2008. Budget support
returned with the PRESO in 2009. A number of planned project were dropped and others slipped to the
following year. Every project originally planned for 2008 was dropped or forwarded to 2009 with the
exception of the Social Mobilization and Balochistan SSIP. Ten projects planned for 2009 were also
dropped, with three added: Third Partnership for Polio Eradication, PESO and second Transport and
Trade Facilitation Project.
53.
Portfolio Performance. As of June 2009, there were 26 projects in the portfolio, with
commitments of $3.6 billion; one of the highest levels in the Bank, although $1.4 billion worth of projects

Annex II
Page 13 of 40

are expected to close in the next 18 months. The Second Poverty Alleviation Fund Project, which became
effective in 2003 and will close in 2010, is the largest, at $551 million (including additional financing),
followed by the Earthquake Emergency Recover Credit at $400 million, Earthquake Responses
Additional Funding ($440 million) and two infrastructure projects - Highway Rehabilitation, and
Electricity Distribution and Transmission. Despite the political, security and economic situations, only 15
percent of projects are at risk (the regional average is14 per cent). The disbursement ratio improved from
34 percent in 2008 to 40 percent for FY09, against a regional average of 24 percent. One third of the
portfolio has had closing dates extended, one by four years, two by 1½ years and the rest by one year.
Some of the extensions were caused by a slow start-up, in many cases because the institutional
arrangements were not in place. Financial management, procurement, slow disbursement, M&E, and
country environment are the most common flags. Almost half the projects in the current portfolio are five
years or older, including two of the three largest projects.
54.
Design and Quality at Entry. Quality reviews generally found design and quality at entry to be
good. For example, the strengths in design of PIFRA II were thought to be the appropriateness of the
approach, both in terms of IT and organizational arrangements, and close and continuous contact with
donors to avoid gaps and duplication. The NWFP CIP II design strength was thought to be the way it
built upon lessons learned in the predecessor project. Being able to build upon earlier related operations
was also identified as the strength of the Balochistan Education Support Project. All three were
successful projects. In contrast the Tax Administration Project was considered not to be ready for
implementation with key project management and institutional problems not resolved 16 months into the
project. The review of the Public Service Capacity Building Project pointed out that the project’s results
could not be sustained unless the civil service was transformed. These last two projects have had limited
success.
55.
Closed Projects. Eight projects were both closed during the CAS period and rated by IEG. All
were approved under the previous CAS. The Partnership for Polio Eradication was rated highly
satisfactory, Trade and Transport, and Punjab Education DPC II and III were rated satisfactory, and PRSC
I, NWFP On Farm Water Management, and Second Partnership for Polio Eradication were rated
moderately satisfactory.
56.
IFC’s portfolio. IFC made new investment commitments of $966 million between FY06-09,
which exceeded the target by $300 million (Annex 8). As a result IFC’s committed portfolio increased
steadily between FY06 and FY09 (FY06 - $273 million, FY07 - $522 million, FY08 - $665 million,
FY09 - $714 million). Of particular note is $224 million in new commitments in FY09 for trade finance,
which offset the lower volume of investment in other sectors during the economic crisis. The overall
portfolio is performing well with about 11% of principal in non-accrual mainly due to a default by one
company. The development impact of projects in Pakistan, tracked by IFC's Development Outcome
Tracking System (DOTS), is generally higher than the IFC average.
Non-Lending
57.
Economic and Sector Work. ESW work conducted during the CAS has been relevant and of high
quality. The analytical work informed future operations, as well as the dialogue with the federal and
provincial governments on macroeconomic and sectoral issues. Peer reviewers generally praise the

Annex II
Page 14 of 40

quality of the deliverables. The non-lending program included 29 pieces of analytical work (See
Attachment 4). Nine had a provincial focus, of which six were focused on public financial management,
including provincial and Federal PEFAs. Core economic and social work included the Pakistan
Earthquake Damage and Needs Assessment, Growth and Export Study, the Higher Education Policy
Note, Rural Growth and Poverty Reduction study, a report on Transport Competitiveness, a Strategic
Country Environment Assessment, a Value Chain Study, and a Gap Analysis of Public Accounting and
Auditing, all prepared early in the CAS, setting the scene for future operations. Economic reports were
prepared for Sindh, Balochistan and the Northern Areas. Later ESW included a Social Safety Net Study, a
Labor Market Study, a Tax Policy Report and a Public Expenditure Review.
58.
Technical Assistance and Policy Advice. Technical assistance, at about $1 million a year, and
policy advice, have been particularly important components of the CAS given the very fluid political and
economic environment, with severe economic problems at a time of political change. The interactions
between the Bank team and Government have focused on fuel and commodity pricing issues, taxation, the
fiscal and balance of payments deficits, and rising debts during the final years of the old administration.
Substantial technical support has also been provided on public financial management and sectoral issues.
However, the dialogue was important in defining the policy reforms to be supported by the budget
operations and also the components of the investment operations throughout the CAS. The Bank’s
mobilization of support and technical assistance following the earthquake has been particularly
appreciated by the Government. Forty nine trust fund financed activities were carried out during the CAS
to provide technical support.
Instruments
59.
PRSCs, DPLs/DPCs. The CAS envisioned that half of the lending program would be delivered
in the form of development policy lending and in the first two years of the CAS period about half the
lending was in the form of budget support. Apart from the first PRSC, which was prepared in 2005,
before this CAS, and a second in 2007, and the PRESO operation, all budget support has taken the form
of provincial DPCs (and one provincial DPL). These DPCs have all been sectoral, based upon reforming
the key policy and institutional issues. They have tended to be annual programmatic operations. There
were four Punjab Education DPCs, including the first one under the previous CAS, two NWFP DPCs, and
two Punjab Irrigation DPLs. After one Sindh Education DPC, the Government and the Bank decided that
the sector’s issues could best be addressed through a more operationally focused three-year Education
Sector Project. The choice of sectors depended on the importance of issues in that sector but even more
so on there being a champion for the reforms. It was expected that reforms in one province would, if
successful, be copied in another. This did happen in the case of some of the educational reforms.
60.
The CAS envisioned annual PRSCs as central to pursuing the structural reform agenda. The first
of a planned series of PRSCs was implemented in 2005. The second the following year was delayed,
largely because of inaction on the critical power issue. The Government was unable to reduce subsidies
to the sector that were now equivalent to 1 per cent of GDP. The planned third PRSC was not prepared.
In the face of an increasingly dire economic situation, the Government entered into a Standby
Arrangement with the IMF and the Bank prepared the PRESO operation. Since many of the issues in the
PRSC series were also critical to the macro dialogue with the IMF, the Bank played a key role in the IMF
program as well as supporting key stabilization actions through PRESO.

Annex II
Page 15 of 40

61.
Common Funds and SWAPs. Although the Bank did not participate in any common funds,
many operations involved a sector wide approach, addressing the policy and institutional issues in the
sector as a whole, as well as in some cases providing investment financing. There was, for example, good
collaboration and parallel financing of programs such as in education in Sindh and Punjab. Most
operations were preceded by analytical work and extensive use was made of trust funds to carry out the
analytical work and provide technical support.
VI.

Aid Coordination and Donor Harmonization

62.
Overall, formal donor collaboration has been relatively weak. At various times donors have
discussed convening a local consultative group or more formal donor group, but this has not happened.
That said, there is good collaboration at the project and sector level, with an effective division of
responsibility, particularly among WB, ADB, and DfID. There was been outstanding collaboration and
cooperation around the natural disasters (the earthquake and floods). While there has not been a lot of
formal work on harmonization, the development partners have made substantial progress in using
countries systems for procurement (all but ICB) and financial management due to the PIFRA project.
There is very good collaboration with the IMF, with staff participating in joint missions and close
coordination on power sector and tax policy/administration. Government formed a set of aid
effectiveness working groups in 2007 to serve as a forum for promoting harmonization of practices across
donors. The consensus among donors was that there is scope for greater harmonization provided
Government were to take a more active role in coordination.
VII.

Client Feedback

63.
A distinction can be made between made between the views of government officials and civil
society. The former are generally very appreciative of the responsiveness of World Bank staff in
Islamabad and Washington. The latter can be critical of the Bank, with their main concern being that the
World Bank does not consult people at the community level sufficiently. This is partly at least a matter of
perceptions: generally where community participation was appropriate, Bank staff, together with
Government counterparts, did consult at the community level. Some of the community based projects
have been among the most successful. The civil society representatives were also similarly critical of the
various governments over the CAS period and the bureaucrats in the public administration. Their general
view was that all parties concerned did not develop and implement programs that sufficiently benefited
the poor. Likewise, feedback emphasized the most effective programs were ones where the World Bank
had had a long involvement in the sector, did not change task managers frequently, the Bank was
prepared to change its own views and there was strong Government ownership.

VIII.

Lessons and Conclusions

64.
The 2006-2009 CAS implemented a number of the recommendations of the completion report for
the previous CAS. This CAS had a strong focus on results throughout the CAS period and on the
programmatic approach in its first two years. The recommended emphasis on capacity building was
implemented through the PSCB project, which ran throughout the CAS period, but little progress was
made with civil service reform. The lending program also featured an increase in TA lending to

Annex II
Page 16 of 40

complement budget support operations as with the Social Safety Nets and Water TA projects. The
completion report also recommended that projects be kept simple and realistic to increase their chances of
being implemented on time as planned. Some were implemented on time and as planned, including some
very complex operations, such as the Earthquake Relief. But many projects were delayed, due to the
political, security and economic environment as well as project complexity.
65.
The economic, political and security situations changed quite dramatically within a year of CAS
preparation, making it much more difficult for the Bank and its partners to implement the objectives of
the CAS and its policy reforms, program, and projects. The CAS was also implemented in a very unstable
governance as well as economic environment. For these reasons the implementation of the Bank’s
program provides important lessons about being flexible and stressing ownership. The implementation of
the CAS demonstrates the importance of monitoring the achievement of its intended outcomes and being
prepared to adjust the program on the basis of the results achieved as well as the changing political,
security and economic environment.
66.
The experience of implementing the FY06-09 CAS underscores the need for flexibility to meet
evolving client needs in the face of deteriorating country conditions. The CAS was designed to be
flexible with a lending envelope that would have permitted a significant increase in lending under a
scenario of continued strong performance. But beyond modulating the overall level of financing,
deteriorating country conditions required the country team to also: increase selectivity and shift focus to
address near-term challenges; identify alternative lending instruments; and, adjust Bank operations to
mitigate security risks. The planned reliance on development policy operations to advance sector
reforms, especially at the provincial level, proved vulnerable to macroeconomic conditions which made
such operations impossible. IBRD lending had to be curtailed as creditworthiness deteriorated while IDA
support was increasingly shifted to programmatic investment operations insofar as possible in order to
sustain support for ongoing reforms. The Bank’s engagement in power and tax administration was
reoriented to address immediate fiscal challenges in coordination with the IMF. Worsening security in
Pakistan required relocation of international staff, significant expenditure on enhancing physical security,
and use of innovative approaches for supervision. Notwithstanding all these challenges, the Bank was
able to deliver an expanded IDA program, contributing significantly to Pakistan’s stabilization efforts.
67.
Social protection national platform, education – macro constraints plus evidence suggested
that policies along were not getting results shifted instruments. PRSCs not possible reform and timing
structural reforms still central..
68.
The next CAS needs to focus more strongly on longstanding structural problems that
contributed to the rapid erosion in growth and stability and to assess more rigorously the degree of
ownership for needed reforms. Efforts to address these problems, including measures to increase tax
revenue collection, contain government spending and to reduce the anti-export bias in economic policy
were underway at the time of the CAS, but these either proved to be short lived or impossible to follow
through on in the prevailing political climate. As a result, the strong growth performance at the time of
the CAS could not be sustained. While these issues were recognized and mentioned in the CAS, in
retrospect, the weakness of ownership and likelihood of reversal should have been recognized and
addressed more forcefully in the CAS policy dialogue and program. By 2007, as the political transition
started to occupy the attention of leaders, it was also becoming clear that the economic, and the associated

Annex II
Page 17 of 40

fiscal, monetary and balance of payments situations were continuing to deteriorate and that the federal
government was not prepared to take the steps needed to rectify matters.
69.
The Bank needs to be more realistic about the pace of institutional reform and capacity
building in Pakistan. Reforming institutions and bringing about systemic change (e.g., reforming the
Federal Bureau of Revenue, improving land records administration, and strengthening the performance of
public sector institutions) almost without exception proceeded more slowly than anticipated in the CAS or
project documents. The legacy of decades of neglect and the influence of entrenched interests are
difficult to overcome, requiring sustained engagement over a long period. In addition a more
comprehensive, less input oriented, approach to capacity building was needed in order to address
incentives and improve performance of public sector entities.
70.
A CAS Progress Report or Interim Strategy Note would have been useful as a way of taking
stock and recalibrating the CAS in light of the rapidly changing strategic environment. The decision
not to prepare a CASPR is understandable in light of the difficulty in anchoring a revised strategy in the
absence of an articulated policy by a new government. However, an ISN would have been possible. Such
a mid-term evaluation may have enabled a clearer decision on whether or not to pursue various CAS
objectives given the prevailing complex political situation. Monitoring and evaluation systems, including
regular progress reports, are essential to a results oriented CAS and to better manage fiduciary risk.
71.
Ownership issues were critical to the successes and failures of the CAS program. Two
particularly important principles were applied by the CAS team in the choice of programs and projects to
be supported by the Bank: there had to be a politically committed champion for the reforms and the
institutional arrangements for implementing the reforms had to be in place. Members of the team noted
that important sector wide reforms and supporting projects in health care and civil service reform were
not included in the CAS because one or both of those principles could not be applied. The taxation
project that was included in the CAS made little progress largely because it lacked a strong national
champion.
72.
Unlike education, there were no major health sector operations, although some health sector
triggers were included in the PRSC, and technical assistance was provided through trust funds. The
Bank’s support to the 2008 Lady Health Worker project was dropped. There were two focused health
sector projects, Polio Eradication and HIV-AIDs Prevention. Bank staff explained the absence of health
DPCs or sector investment programs by the lack of a champion for reform. The Bank carried out a health
sector review that includes options for future reform.
73.
In the case of civil service reform the Government set up a commission to examine key issues.
The commission has prepared some recommendations on pay and pensions, but they have yet to be
published, let alone acted upon by the Government. No plans have been prepared to restructure the civil
service.
74.
The failure of the CAS to achieve its economic growth and stabilization objectives is, partly,
some said largely, attributable to the Government’s inability to take the necessary tough policy decisions
on taxation and the price of fuel and food. The Bank maintained a strong policy dialogue throughout the
CAS. The Tax Administration project was an instrument for carrying out the technical work and capacity

Annex II
Page 18 of 40

building that could have underpinned tax reforms that would have mobilized more tax revenue and
therefore reduced the budget deficit. Likewise, a parallel TA activity has been ongoing to press forward
with the tax admin reform for the past year
75.
The omissions of health sector, agriculture, taxation and civil service reform from the program
raises the issue: what should the Bank do if a sector faces serious problems, yet there is no champion for
reform, even more so if reform in the sector concerned is needed to complement and sustain reforms
elsewhere? In the cases of the health sector and civil service reform, the Bank could have focused
operations at lower levels of government and, in the case of health, communities. Some members of the
team believe that the Bank should have been more active at the local government rather than provincial
level. The CAS’s operations at the community level were amongst its most successful in achieving the
intended outcomes.
76.
A strategy that may work where ownership is weak is to support technocratic champions at the
mid-levels of the provincial and federal civil services, in the hope that those champions could and would
win support from the administrative and political leadership. The Bank did indeed carry out a policy
dialogue on health and civil service reform throughout the CAS, but never managed to develop a critical
mass of support for systemic reform from with the administration. In some instances project preparation
was spread over many years in order to build ownerships and make sure the institutional arrangements for
implementation were in place. PIFRA was such a project.

• Poor tax mobilization was a significant bar in achieving the target ratio and total revenue actually fell
from a very low 14.9% of GDP in 2007 to 14.3% in 2008. There is still weak enforcement of tax
collection culture. Without the FBR taking on strong enforcement activities, tax payers still do not
meet their obligations to file accurate returns and pay their obligations on time.
• There has been modest progress on the integration of income tax and sales tax functions. There is still
a weak financial management system at the FBR and more work in strengthening the procurement
system must be brought about. A positive sign has been that the top management structure at FBR
headquarters is now in place..
• The macroeconomic situation deteriorated in the CAS period. Not enough direction was taken in
addressing low tax revenue mobilization. The Government did not pass on the higher costs of

• The NWFP On-Farm Water Management Project had as its overall objective of increasing agricultural
growth and productivity and expanding farm incomes through better irrigation. The IEG appraisal
recognized that the project delivered on its key outputs, even exceeding some expectations. The
ongoing Sindh On-Farm Water Management Project has also resulted in increased yields - according
to a recent survey, cropping intensity and crop yields have increased by 14 percent and 12 percent
respectively compared with the baseline data.
• The IMF Pakistan, 2009, Article IV Consultation and First Review Under the Stand-By Arrangement
noted that agricultural output in wheat crop were positive and described it as ‘bumper year’ and
significant increases in the rice and cotton crops were also recorded, though there was a decline in
sugar cane production. However improved access to water will continue to underpin growth in the
agriculture sector.
• A separate Agricultural Marketing Department was created to formulate and implement internal and
export market strategies, to facilitate the linkages and partnerships between farmers and cooperatives,
public and private sectors.
• Pakistan’s trade policy has been mainly geared towards export diversification in the nontraditional
sector, by reducing the cost of doing business and enhancing productivity and competitiveness in
manufacturing. The Government has also made efforts to enhance market access for Pakistan’s
exports—particularly to development partners.

• Some success in
increasing productivity,
but little progress in
improving functioning of
land markets.
• Little progress in export of
non-traditional crops

• For barrage rehabilitation the physical outcomes were met but although some farmers were
disadvantaged because inadequate amounts of water reached their areas and in the FY08 their
situation was aggravated by acute water shortages in the Indus River.
• The development policy loans attempted to emphasize the nexus of water entitlements, measurements
and transparency. Water accounts for instance continued to be posted on the Irrigation and Power
Development website – fostering the creation of a transparent administration of water entitlements
and sustainable management of water resources.
• Studies were carried out to identify issues on water entitlements, and legal and physical constraints to,

• An outcome of the NWFP On-Farm Water Management Project, according to IEG noted that farmers
in the project area have become much more aware of their roles in managing water resources at
distributaries, minors, and watercourse levels. These results are expected to lead to significant
increases in farm incomes, and contribute to poverty reduction in the project area: today, the irrigation
infrastructure rehabilitated under the Project is serving some 132,000 ha of irrigated land upon which
the livelihoods of some 2 million people are directly or indirectly dependent.

Improving the Business Environment for Trade and Investment
• Strengthened
competitiveness,
increased productivity

• Pakistan’s rank for “protecting investors” slipped from 19 in 2008 to 24 in 2009.
• The challenges for launching a business worsened with a fall in three places from 74 in 2008 to 77 in
2009.
• The PRSC aimed to enhance competitiveness through reducing barriers to business entry and exit and
strengthening the financial sector. Moderately Satisfactory progress was achieved under PRSC I. It
was stated in the ICR that foreign investors display significantly increased interest in the Pakistani
market.

• Staffing of Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) was improved with more than 60 staff
transferred from WAPDA to CPPA. This is an important step toward establishing a credible CPPA
capable of fulfilling its function.
• Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited (PTCL): The bidding and transfer of management
control to Etisalat (UAE) for a 26% stake was completed in March 2006.

• Despite the various challenges faced by Pakistan over the last few years, success in the ICT sector has
been steady. In 2007-2008, the private FDI in telecoms was approximately 30% of overall FDI in
Pakistan.

• Over the last CAS period, teledensity increased 5 fold from approximately 12% (in July 2005) to just
over 60% (end March 2009), despite a drop in compounded annual growth rate in 2008. There has
been a push to take services into rural, previously unserved and underserved areas (despite security
and political challenges.
• There was improved traffic flow on the network monitored through improvements in key indicators
relating to: (i) road network condition; (ii) travel time; and (iii) road safety. The PDO for the
Highways Rehabilitation project is rated as ‘Satisfactory’.
• NHA has implemented increased toll rates, which will result in additional Rs 1.5 to 1.8 billion
resources for maintenance. Toll implementation with regards to trucks remained suspended when
Government (on demand of transporters) reduced the toll rates from August 15, 08 - December 31,

• Although, the authorities maintained a premium between domestic and international petroleum prices,
the retail prices of petroleum products were significantly reduced to pass in part the benefit of lower
oil prices to consumers. On December 1, the retail prices of gasoline and diesel were reduced by Rs. 9
and Rs. 4 per liter to Rs. 57.7 ($0.73) and Rs. 48.0 ($0.61), respectively.

• The fuel price issue was a
major part of the policy

Government. Generally
although the technocrats
appreciated the need to
raise prices, the political
leadership was unwilling to

• The Polio Eradication II project achieved its development objective in terms of coverage but failed
with its zero case objectives.
• The Contraceptive Prevalence Rate (CPR) for Pakistan stands at 22 percent, less than half that of
other South Asian countries. The contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) was 30 percent for all methods
and 22 percent for modern methods in 2008. This is almost a four-fold increase in modern methods
usage compared to its value of 5.2 percent in 1974-75.
• The percentage of births attended by health professionals (doctor, nurse, midwife or LHV) increased
from 23 percent to 36 percent while institutional deliveries rose from 21 to 32 percent over the last
three years.
• HIV, in some cities, has spread to male sex workers (MSWs) and Hijras (Eunuch Sex Workers,
ESWs). The positive achievement was that HIV appears not to have spread yet to the female sex
worker (FSW) population and, in those cities with extensive HIV prevention efforts; there has been a

• The Bank decided to
support narrowly focused
reforms. The Bank felt that
there were enough other
donors in the sector and that
the sector lacked champions
for major reforms.

decrease in risky behaviors among the high-risk groups.

Reduced Vulnerability and Improved livelihoods of poor communities through effective safety nets, targeted interventions and hazard risk management
• Vulnerability reduced
through
implementation of well
targeted, financially
viable, and well
administered social
assistance and social
security programs.

• Increased school
attendance among
poor children
(bottom 2 quintiles)
and among disabled
children.
• Coverage of safety
nets increased from
4% to 20% for poor
(bottom 2 quintiles).
• Reduction in fiscal
liabilities of the
civil service
pensions.
Increased community
participation in the
decision making
process and
partnership between
municipalities.
• Improved delivery
of services, and
productive and
social infrastructure.
• Increased access to
credit, including
microcredit.

• The Planning Commission’s constituted Panel of Economists in its Interim Report based on 2004- 05:
the poverty head count number of 23.9 percent suggested an increase of around 6 percentage points in
poverty incidence for the year 2008-09.
• Similarly, the Task Force on Food Security based on the World Bank estimates of poverty head count
ratio of 29.2 percent in 2004-05 estimated that poverty head count increased to 33.8 percent in 200708 and 36.1 percent in 2008-09 or about 62 million people in 2008-09 were below the poverty line.
• Data suggests that between 2005 and 2009 more than 12-14 million people may have been added to
the ranks of the poor in Pakistan. This would translate into an increase in poverty from 22.3 percent of
the population in 2005-06 to between 30-35 percent in 2008-09.
• Through the NWFP CIP II, the preparation of over 600 community actions plans agreed between
CCBs and TMAs has resulted in improved responsiveness of municipal authorities to community
priorities.
• Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund has enhanced the availability of resources and services to the poor.
Since commencement of operations in April 2000 to date, PPAF has disbursed approximately Rs 55.5
billion to 75 Partner Organizations across the country.
• The AJK Community Infrastructure Project (CISP), CIP and PPAF supported programs such as
community managed drinking water, sanitation, pavements and link roads- made moderately
satisfactory implementation in spite of the 2005 earthquake.

• Although poverty levels
have risen, some of the well
targeted support by the
World Bank has helped to
reduce vulnerability.
• 600,000 earthquake victims
provided with earthquake
resistant homes
• However disaster
management institutional
capacity has not been
established. The agency
concerned has not been
given responsibility for the
recent IDPs.
• The World Bank played an
important role supporting
PPAF, CIP and CISP.

World Bank Performance

• The Bank is currently supporting a multi-sectoral response through its Earthquake Recovery Project
(ERP) and Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund (PPAF).

World Bank response to the
earthquake was seen as global
best practice.

o The ERP includes housing reconstruction, livelihood support, import financing, and capacity
building. The PPAF is mainly focusing on housing reconstruction. The overall housing program
is progressing satisfactorily, with more than 80 percent of the destroyed houses at various stages
of reconstruction, and more than 25 percent having already been substantially completed to
seismic resistant standards. Similarly, the original livelihoods support component, entailing
monthly livelihood support grants to eligible affected families was satisfactorily completed in
December 2006. The Bank has supported rehabilitation of national highways damaged in the
earthquake. Furthermore, on government’s request, the Bank in collaboration with Asian
Development Bank, conducted a preliminary damage and needs assessment of the cyclone/flood
affected areas of Sindh and Balochistan in August 2007. This was done on similar lines as the
earthquake 2005 damage and needs assessment, which was completed in three weeks.
500 community physical infrastructure schemes were rehabilitated in 32 union councils in NWFP and
AJK. 200,000 houses were completed (the objective was to completed 241,000 before the end of the
project). By this time, 750,000 people were trained or provided basic training in seismic resistant housing
construction

Item

Parameter

Explanation/Remarks

Cost Sharing: Limit on the proportion of
individual project costs that the Bank may
finance

Up to 100%

The Bank’s financing percentage in each project would be
determined on a case-by-case basis, depending upon project
type, sector, etc. In many projects, the practice of requiring
government counterpart funding would continue. In
general, low to moderate contribution by Government
(federal/provincial), beneficiaries and others are expected
in CDD-type projects and water sector projects. Moderate
contribution by Government (federal/provincial) is
expected in infrastructure projects. 100% Bank financing
could occur in pro-poor projects, such as social sector
projects and projects in poor and remote areas. 100% Bank
financing may also occur in capacity building projects with
moderate to high in-kind contribution by the Government
(such as staff time, office space and equipment).

Recurrent Cost Financing: Any limits
that would apply to the overall amount of
recurrent expenditures that the Bank may
finance

No countrylevel limit

In determining Bank financing of recurrent costs in
individual projects, the Bank will take into account
sustainability issues at the sector and project levels.
Financing of recurrent costs will be carefully assessed,
particularly financing of Government staff salaries, which
the Bank will only finance for specific purposes. For
example, where our support is primarily programmatic
(such as in the education sector), there may be need to
finance recurrent costs and for a longer duration (as long as
program continues) to support achievement of program
objectives. Recurrent cost financing may also be allowed to
support cost of managing project implementation and to
ensure sustainability of project activities.

Local Cost Finance: Are the requirements
for Bank financing of local expenditures
met,
namely
that:
(i)
financing
requirements
for
the
country’s
development program would exceed the
public sector’s own resources (e.g., from
taxation and other revenues) and expected
domestic borrowing; and (ii) the financing
of foreign expenditures alone would not
enable the bank to assist in the financing of
individual projects

Yes

The two criteria are met. Therefore the Bank may finance
local costs in any proportion needed in individual projects.

Taxes and Duties: Are there any taxes and
duties that the Bank would not finance?

No

Taxes and duties in Pakistan are generally reasonable. Also,
taxes and duties are not discriminatory against Bankfinanced projects. At the project-level, the Bank would
consider whether taxes and duties constitute an excessively
high share of project cost.

A NNE X I V : P A R T NE R SH I PS
1.
The World Bank in Pakistan engages with the federal, provincial governments and
coordinates with the development partners on a regular basis through various formal and
informal mechanisms. There is an ongoing dialogue with the governments both at the level of
country management and technical teams in the context of overall country and sector strategy
and for preparation and implementation of specific operations. With the development partners
also, there are periodic exchanges at the level of heads of development agencies to ensure
synergies in respective programs and to follow up on opportunities of collaboration, cofinancing, parallel financing or supplementary grants. There are some technical level informal
donor coordination forums also which meet fairly regularly to discuss issues of common interest.
2.
In the spirit of the Paris Declaration, the Bank supports the Government in leading
coordination of the policy dialogue and donor support in Pakistan. The Economic Affairs
Division, Ministry of Finance has established a Donor Coordination Cell and has been working
to improve its functional capacity. In the provinces, the Provincial Planning and Development
Departments are responsible for coordinating with development partners. The Pakistan
Development Forum is one of the key mechanisms the government uses to facilitate discussion
on priority development issues and coordinate donors around the government’s poverty
reduction strategy and program. Annual PDFs were held until 2006 when the event could not be
organized for reasons of political transition and security considerations. The government intends
to resume the PDF from this year and the forum is currently planned to take place in 2010. There
have been efforts to replicate the forum at the provincial level and the Punjab Development
Forum was organized every year from 2003-2007. The Bank provides financial and technical
support to the government in organizing the PDFs and to bring greater clarity and focus on the
key results the government intends to achieve. We will continue to work with development
partners and the government to further refine linkages and align the strategies and results in
respective programs to support achievement of aid effectiveness goals. Table 1 highlights the
engagement of development partners in Pakistan with reference to the priority defined under the
Pakistan’s Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRSP-II).
3.
A recent development is the government’s plan to formulate an Aid Effectiveness Policy
to formalize guidelines, parameters, and results framework for the aid dialogue and coordination
agenda. The Bank welcomes the effort and has expressed support for the endeavor. Another
significant initiative to provide leadership on implementation of the Paris Declaration
commitments is the Steering Committee on Aid Effectiveness, which is convened and chaired
by the Minister of Economic Affairs and includes all multilaterals and major bilateral donors as
members. As part of the deliberations of the Steering Committee, a number of Working
Groups have been created to support the government efforts on implementation of the Paris
Declaration goals. The working groups are co-led by the donors and the government. The
World Bank is co-leading two of the Working Groups to help the government in implementing
the Sector Wide Approaches (SWAp) in Education and to achieve Harmonization and
Strengthening of Financial Management and Procurement Systems. Key developments and
recommendations of these groups are discussed in the section below. The Bank also
participated and provided inputs to the other working groups co-led by the ADB (Capacity
Development) and DFID (Strengthening of Monitoring and Evaluation Systems). The working
groups serve as effective platform for a focused discussion on some key Paris Declaration

Annex IV
Page 2 of 6

commitments such as strengthening of the country systems. However, implementation of the
recommendations of the working groups would require sustained attention and effort both on
part of the government and the development partners. Continued leadership of the government
to steer this process and commitment on part of the development partners to bring some
fundamental changes in the way they do business will be imperative in determining the outcome
of this initiative. The Bank will continue to support the government in the process of
implementing the proposed actions of the working groups.

4.
The Working Group on Financial Management and Procurement, Country Systems
Strengthening and Harmonization is co-chaired by the Ministry of Finance and the World
Bank. The Group’s mandate is to deliberate and evaluate proposals to help improve the

Annex IV
Page 3 of 6

government systems to graduate to a level of robustness and compliance with international
standards to provide an acceptable mechanism for partners to channel aid. At the same time, the
working group is also required to put forth proposals for the donors to simplify, harmonize and
align their procedures and reporting requirements to the government systems. The report for the
Financial Management Systems has been finalized and the findings have been shared and
discussed with the partners and the government. The draft report on Procurement Systems is at
an advanced stage and will be finalized shortly. The Financial Management Report has
applied generally accepted framework of PEFA indicators/sub-indicators as benchmarks to
analyze the existing government FM practices and performance in externally-financed projects.
Specific recommendations have been made for the government and partners identifying entry
points for streamlining the budgeting and accounting procedures, expenditure management, inyear and year-end financial reporting, internal and external auditing functions, and legislative
scrutiny/review by Public Accounts Committee etc. For these functions, donors will also need to
adjust their requirements to align with the country systems and specific areas for actions have
been highlighted in the report.
5.
The Procurement Report (to be finalized) has applied the generally accepted framework
of OECD DAC Baseline Indicators and UNCITRAL Model Legislation on Procurement as
benchmarks (broadly accepted good practices) for assessing the country procurement systems.
These include indicators on legislative and regulatory framework, institutions and management
capacity, procurement operations and market practices, and integrity and transparency of public
procurement systems including the appeals mechanism. Initial findings suggest gaps in the
country systems which need to be addressed to allow their use by partners. While procurement
reforms by the federal government, provincial governments, and autonomous public bodies are
underway and Governments have established the overarching regulatory authorities, they need
strengthening and the legislation creating these authorities also needs review. Detailed
guidelines and standard bidding documents are generally missing. In general, capacity issues in
procuring agencies, regulatory authorities, and accountability institutions are the major
bottlenecks in achieving efficiency, economy, and transparency of the procurement systems.
The assessment also points towards a need for a capacity development framework, and suggests
an action plan to take forward the systems reform and harmonization agenda in parallel. In terms
of harmonization, major multilaterals, the World Bank and ADB, have made good progress to
align their procurement guidelines and standard bidding documents for borrowers. Joint conduct
of procurement diagnostic studies, and greater collaboration with partners during preparation of
SWAp operations are other outcomes worth mentioning. Nonetheless, the report highlights that
donors need to better align their assistance for procurement systems reforms and have to
harmonize the way procurement systems capacity is assessed and build a common approach
towards mitigating identified risks.
6.
Working Group on Sector wide Approaches (SWAps) in Education, co-led by the
Bank, had a series of consultations with federal, provincial governments and partners working in
the education sector in Pakistan. The working group deliberations helped form a broad
consensus that a sector wide approach to support the Government’s own framework of reforms
and education development has the promise to deliver on effective coordination of financial and
technical assistance. The Sector-Wide Approach (SWAp) allows the Government and the
donors to finance a sector program rather than a particular project based on a clear sector strategy
and an agreed mid-term expenditure framework. It brings out the focus on sector results and

Annex IV
Page 4 of 6

outcomes and helps strengthen institutions and country systems, promote holistic and strategic
thinking, flexible use of program resources to finance the sector program, and has a potential to
reduce transaction costs. As an outcome of the discussion of the Working Group, there has been
significant progress in coordinating donor support to the education sector in Pakistan. The Bank,
along with partners has prepared operations coordinating support around the medium term
education sector reform programs of Punjab and Sindh. A similar initiative is underway for the
NWFP. Disbursements under the Bank’s operations reimburse the governments against selected
key education budget line items referred to as Eligible Expenditure Programs (EEPs) such as
teacher salaries, girls stipends etc. Disbursements are based on the achievement of pre-specified
results, referred to as disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs), which represent priority elements in
the respective reform programs. Total financing provided by the development partners amounts
to approximately 15% of the total education sector programs. Financing such holistic sector
programs has reduced duplication of effort and encouraged each partner to support overall sector
results and outcomes.
7.
Other Harmonization and Alignment Initiatives: The Bank has taken concrete steps
to harmonize its procedures including financial management and procurement. As mentioned
earlier, the World Bank and Asian Development Bank’s procurement rules and documents are
synchronized to a large extent. A similar exercise is underway in the area of financial
management. Effective July 1, 2003 the World Bank has simplified, updated and clarified its
audit policies in line with its commitment to enhance partners’ capacity and to harmonize with
other donors. Consequently, with the change in audit policies, the World Bank may accept the
normal audited financial statements of the borrower and implementing entities, when they are
prepared and audited in accordance with standards acceptable to the Bank and disclose
information in line with the Bank’s requirements on the activities supported by the Bank funds;
may also accept national auditing standards when these are considered equivalent to international
standards, and may permit exemptions from the normal audit in limited circumstances. The
Bank may accept a single audit opinion on the annual financial statements for each operation it
supports instead of requiring separate opinions on statements of expenditure and special
accounts.
8.
Joint Programs and Analytical Work: Japan is providing parallel financing for the
Poverty Reduction Strategy Credit (PRSC). DFID is supporting the projects on Tax
Administration Reform, HIV/Aids and Social Safety Nets. As mentioned in section 6, DFID, EC,
CIDA, GTZ and the Bank are coordinating support around the medium term education sector
frameworks in Punjab and Sindh. The Bank is preparing an HD operation (education, health,
social protection) for the Government of NWFP on similar lines from EC, AusAid, GTZ,
Norway and DfID.
9.
The Bank has been actively encouraging joint analytical work to inform policy dialogue
and program development around key issues. During the previous CAS period, the Bank worked
with DFID, ADB, and the EC to deliver Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability
(PEFA) Assessments for all four provinces. Provincial Economic Reports for all four provinces
were also prepared jointly with partners. The economic report on Gilgit-Baltistan is being
prepared jointly with the Agha Khan Development Network and is at an advanced stage. Most
recently, the Bank has worked with DFID and EC to carry out an integrated Review of Public
Expenditure, Procurement, and Financial Management Practices in Pakistan. The World Bank

Annex IV
Page 5 of 6

and the IMF developed a strategic partnership for implementation and monitoring the IMF
Stand-By Arrangement whereby the World Bank led policy dialogue on tax administration,
electricity and social protection issues. Further, in response to a series of crisis (earthquake,
floods, military intervention), the World Bank has led a number of Damage and Needs
Assessments (DNAs) with participation from more than 15 development partners in the past few
years. The earthquake response effort is considered a best practice where a G-7 plus forum was
effectively convened to ensure common direction and coordination of the relief, early recovery,
and reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts. This model was quickly replicated later in
organizing timely response to emergency situations after flash floods and most recently for the
DNA and Post Crisis Needs Assessment (PCNA) following the Pakistan Army's offensive in the
Swat Valley - (please see next sections for discussion on PCNA and MDTF).
10.
The World Bank, under the leadership of the Government, will continue to increase
partnership efforts. This will include enhanced utilization of trust funds and ensuring that
such trust funds are entirely integrated into World Bank budgeting and strategy processes. As of
end December 2009, the Pakistan program included 62 active trust funds with a net commitment
of over US$116 million. The DFID Funded Poverty Reduction Support Credit Technical
Assistance trust fund has been financing critical inputs to support tax policy/administration
reforms and implementation of the safety net programs. The analytical work supported by the
DFID trust fund is expected to help develop consensus on the needed policy reforms in poverty
reduction, education quality, and private sector development. The Bank has also been
administering Japanese Social Development Fund (JSDF) and Japan Policy and Human
Resources Development Fund (PHRD) grants to finance significant interventions in health,
education, environment and earthquake affected areas including support for the IDA Disability
Project. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and UN Foundation supported initiatives of
Polio eradication in Pakistan in the form of Buy Down arrangements. Other major partners
providing grant resources through the Bank are Netherlands, Germany, AusAid, and CIDA.
11.
Given the economic challenges and an increasing interest among development partners to
support Pakistan, the "Friends of Democratic Pakistan" meeting and the Tokyo Donors
Conference were organized in April 2009. The World Bank co-organized the Donors
Conference with the Government of Japan and supported Government of Pakistan in the process
of mobilizing support from the development partners. Though programming and timely delivery
of the financial pledges by partners remain to be an issue, the Bank has been actively supporting
the government and partners in identifying viable platforms and instruments to program the
financial pledges and leverage capacities in the country’s priority areas. The Multi-donor Trust
Fund (MDTF) for the Northwest Frontier Province (NWFP), FATA and Balochistan is one such
example. On the request of the government, the Bank is putting this trust fund together to
provide development partners a viable platform to pool their funds to support achievement of
common goal of post-crises reconstruction and rehabilitation of the border areas.
12.
The MDTF will enable strategic prioritization of projects for funding and provide a
mechanism for enhanced donor coordination and platform to effectively harmonize donor
programs across strategic priorities agreed between donors and government. The trust fund
financing will be part of the government budget and associated reconstruction and development
programs. The overall objective of the MDTF will be to support implementation of a program of
reconstruction and development aimed at recovering from the impact of the conflict and reducing

Annex IV
Page 6 of 6

the potential for renewed conflict. The MDTF will finance projects identified by local and
provincial governments to: (1) promote enhanced, sustainable and accountable delivery of basic
services, including education, health, and administration of justice; (2) support livelihoods and
community-based development of basic infrastructure and services; (3) help communities to
access assets and market opportunities and create the basis for viable income generating
activities; (4) support peace building activities and promote rapid crisis recovery in the
Northwest Frontier Province, Federally Administered Tribal Areas, and Balochistan; 1 and (5)
improving state effectiveness by strengthening governance and institutional performance.
13.
The strategic priorities and programming of the MDTF will be informed by the ongoing
Post-Conflict Needs Assessment (PCNA), the Government’s PRSP and other analytical work
as needed. Following a request from the Government of Pakistan, the PCNA process was
formally initiated in the middle of August 2009, with the UN, EC, and ADB as key partners or
core group supporting GOP, GoNWFP and FATA Secretariat. The PCNA aims to cover the
immediate post crisis transition and stabilization phase, medium term transformation, as well as
the longer-term institution building, consolidation and development periods. The first phase of
the PCNA—a Damage and Needs Assessment—was completed in November, 2009. The DNA is
part of, and aligned with, the PCNA framework for crisis recovery – focusing on immediate
service delivery-related infrastructure reconstruction and livelihoods restoration needs. Since the
full PCNA will not be complete for several months; the design of the MDTF will be flexible to
accommodate its findings. The PCNA will lead to the formulation of a Transitional Results
Framework that will identify priority outcomes and actions, in particular those aimed at
addressing the causes of conflict. The MDTF is expected to serve to mobilize and manage donor
resources directed at, inter alia, achieving these outcomes. Moreover, flexibility will be required
to allow the trust fund to address possible changes in the development context or to take
advantage of emerging opportunities. To ensure effective information exchange on the PCNA
and MDTF process, clear and regular communication is being maintained with partners,
including periodic updates and consultations at key milestones of the process.
14.
The Bank will continue to build on the strong foundation of partnerships as described
above based on mutual trust and accountability. In the same spirit, we have recently concluded
the Consultations on the WB Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2010-2013 and the final
draft has benefited from the valuable feedback that we received from the government and
development partners. This would be used as a basis for a sustained dialogue in the coming
years to ensure complementarity and effectiveness of donor support to Pakistan.

For the purpose of this document the term “peace-building activities” means: activities that can be undertaken or
financed consistent with the Bank’s mandate and legal and policy framework that include the broad spectrum of
reconstruction and institution-building efforts necessary to recover from conflict and that support the formulation of
integrated strategies in order to lay the foundation for sustainable development including social and economic
reintegration of conflict-affected populations, financing labor-intensive employment initiatives, financial support
and technical assistance for economic reconstruction, and rebuilding legal and judicial systems.
