EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

i.

Mozambique has sustained rapid growth since achieving peace in 1992, largely
due to one-time events such as resettlement and the transformation o f a centrally-planned
state-owned economy into an market-oriented one. In this context, investment flourished
and Mozambique’s external partners granted large amounts o f aid. The Bank has helped
the Government to achieve growth, deliver services, build capacity, and transform aid
modalities to sector-wide approaches and budget support against agreed performance
indicators. This new Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) plans a continuation and
deepening o f past Bank efforts. The following issues are suggested for Board discussion:
0

0

I s the Bank Group’s proposed support to the Government’s poverty reduction
strategy appropriate and adequate?
I s the evolving division o f labor among the Government, the Bank and
Mozambique’s other external partners appropriate?

..

Mozambique’s development program has delivered mixed results. Incomes have
improved since 1992, but most Mozambicans s t i l l live in poverty. Growth has been high,
but has tended to involve exploiting natural capital in unsustainable ways. Exports
(outside large-scale projects) are flat; many f i r m s are struggling; labor and capital
productivity are below regional averages; and some bank portfolios are distressed.
11.

iii. T o reduce poverty, Mozambique needs rapid growth sourced in agriculture and
labor-intensive manufacturing and services. Improving agricultural productivity will
require using yield-improving inputs and technologies and rehabilitating essential rural
infrastructure. Expanding manufacturing and services will require easing k e y business
constraints, which entrepreneurs consistently identify as lack o f access to and high cost o f
credit, high regulatory and administrative barriers, and inefficiencies in k e y
infrastructure. Poverty reduction also depends o n redistributing and increasing the
efficiency o f public spending towards poverty-reducing sectors such as health, education,
and water supply. Curtailing corruption and expanding c i v i l service capacity are the key
issues here.
This CAS, which supports the Government’s poverty reduction strategy, focuses
iv.
on three areas: (i)
improving the investment climate; (ii)
expanding service delivery; and
(iii)
building public-sector capacity and accountability structures.
The Bank Group i s ideally suited to helping to improve the investment climate, as
v.
i t can provide full-service policy advice and complementary instruments to support the
private sector. For example, the Southern A h c a Regional Gas Project, w h i c h i s being
presented to the Board together with this CAS, involves a MIGA guarantee, an IFC
equity participation, and an IBRD partial risk guarantee. The C A S will also support
several large high-risk developments, because they have demonstrative effect (such as the
second National Water Development project, w h i c h supports private-sector urban water
supply), or because they will have a catalytic impact o n growth (such as the Second
Roads and Bridges project, which will finance rural roads as w e l l as the Caia bridge over

the Zambezi river, and the Beira Railway project, which will open the Zambezi valley
and promote regional integration). The Group will also prepare a Rural Development
project piloting an integrated approach to rural development. Finally, a series o f Poverty
Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs), representing about 40% o f total IDA financing, will
support reforms aiming, among other things, to improve the financial sector, increase
labor flexibility, facilitate access to land, increase access to water supply, speed customs
clearance, and reduce business registration costs.
Building o n ongoing sector-wide programs (SWAPS), the PRSCs will help to
improve health care, educational and agricultural services, by addressing k e y planning
and management issues. In addition, IDA will prepare a $20 m i l l i o n Technical and
Vocational Education project to help improve skills levels among Mozambican workers.
vi.

Building Government capacity and accountability structures i s also a Bank Group
vii.
focus. The Public Sector Reform (PSR) project, supported by Bank Adaptable Program
Lending (APL) which will enter i t s $25 m i l l i o n second phase in FY07, will improve
capacity for service delivery by decentralizing and rationalizing procedures, piloting
improved incentives, and improving public financial management and procurement
systems. In addition, the Municipal Development project and a proposed Decentralized
Planning and Finance project (a $42 m i l l i o n IDA grant that i s before the Board together
with this CAS) will complement the PSR project and the PRSCs by helping local
authorities to manage small-scale service delivery through “learning by doing” in ways
that make them more accountable to local populations. The Bank will also support
capacity-building in the financial sector ($10 million) and in the legal sector ($5 million)
and will w o r k with the Government at all levels to improve monitoring and evaluation.
viii.
Mozambique will remain in the base case if macroeconomic stability continues,
the PARPA i s satisfactorily implemented, the national program to fight H I V / A I D S
remains o n track, and portfolio performance i s good. Total base case financing o f $560
m i l l i o n over four years would fully utilize Mozambique’s current IDA allocation. The
Government can realize a high case o f $800 m i l l i o n over four years if it resolves the
problems o f the banking system; accelerates implementation o f public sector reform as
w e l l as the legal and judicial reform; substantially improves the investment climate;
improves transparency in allocating natural resources; and maintains very good portfolio
performance. A l o w case scenario w o u l d result if there were significant reversals in
economic policies; significant deviation from the PARPA; c i v i l strife or governance
practices that cause external partners to reduce their support for an extended period; or
significant deterioration in portfolio performance. A s a result IDA financing could fall to
about $350 m i l l i o n over four years and the PRSC series w o u l d b e discontinued. The
Bank will monitor low, base and high case triggers o n a continual basis.

Risks to C A S implementation include adverse political developments as
Mozambique approaches new Presidential and parliamentary elections next year;
continuing capacity constraints; an insufficiently aggressive response to the H I V / A I D S
epidemic; and adverse exogenous developments such as flood, drought, or conflict.
These risks are being mitigated through policy dialogue; stronger donor coordination; and
selected Bank-supported activities as set out in this CAS.

INTRODUCTION

1.
Mozambique has sustained rapid growth since achieving peace in 1992. One-time
events contributed, such as the return o f displaced people to the countryside, the achievement o f macroeconomic stability, and the transformation o f a centrally-planned stateowned economy into a market-oriented one. In this context, domestic and foreign investment flourished, and Mozambique’s development partners granted substantial assistance.
Yet results have been mixed. Incomes improved in the 1990s, but most Mozambicans
still live in poverty, in rural areas far from services and markets, where productivity and
off-farm incomes are low. Recent growth has been high, but i t seems to b e weakening.
Outside selected industries (e.g. aluminum), exports have been flat. While some new
businesses are doing well, older ones are struggling, and many have been shedding rather
than creating jobs. Recently privatized f i r m s are floundering; labor and capital productivity are below regional averages; and bank portfolios, especially loans to state-owned
enterprises and the agricultural sector, are distressed. T o reduce poverty, Mozambique
needs rapid growth sourced in agriculture and labor-intensive manufacturing and
services. I t also needs to redistribute public spending towards sectors with high povertyreducing potential, such as health, education, and water supply. The Government’s
Action Plan for the Reduction o f Absolute Poverty (PARPA) for 2001 to 2005 proposes
appropriate actions in this context, and this C A S aims to support their implementation.
POVERTY AND THE MACROECONOMY
Poverty, Social Context and Issues

2.

Poverty levels and indicators: Despite post-conflict annual growth exceeding 7%
in the mid-1990s and 9% since 1997, Mozambique remains one o f the world’s poorest
countries, with a GDP per capita o f $210. In 1998, the first national household survey
showed that, while conditions had improved since 1992, when the war ended and
Mozambique was the world’s poorest country, 69% o f Mozambicans still lived below a
poverty line based o n the minimum caloric intake. Over the last five years, overall
growth and investment in health, education, and infrastructure appears to have improved
some Mozambicans’ lives. A first national household survey was completed in 1998, but

Indicator

in 2002, are not yet available, so it
._
not possible to assess poverty trends
robustly. Extrapolating from CWIQ
variables, simulations indicate that
household poverty and the poverty
gap fell between 1996-97 and 200001, but this result needs to b e
verified when the Government and
IFPRI report the second household
survey data in December 2003.
Table 1 shows recent progress
against selected indicators.
~

Box 1: Gender inequalities continue in Mozambique
Mozambique’s gender indicators are below regional averages. The maternal mortality rate at 1,600
per 100,000 live births i s high; the quality o f and access to health care-particularly to repwductive
health services-are poor; and literacy rates for women are much lower than for men, especially in rural
areas. One in five households i s female-headed, and these households typically have less adult labor,
cultivate less land and participate less frequently in paid employment. Although remittances from
absent males make these households o n average n o worse-off than male-headed households, households
without remittances are much worse off; and households with male adults working elsewhere are at
more risk o f H I V / A I D S . Domestic violence i s also a problem, though largely a hdden one.
The cross-sectoral integration o f gender i s vital to improving the welfare o f the poor and increasing
project effectiveness. The Government i s currently implementing a national Post-Beijing Action Plan,
yet discussions o f gender tend to focus o n female-headed households, maternal and child health, and
educational attainment. The causes o f gender inequality and policies to address them (e.g. improving
women’s access to land, credit, and extension services; addressing cultural and religious practices that
perpetuate gender imbalances; increasing women’s involvement in decision making; and securing
greater equity in employment opportunities) are less noticed. In early 2003, a new and progressive
family l a w approved by parliament addressed many outstanding issues (it eliminated many forms o f
discrimination, recognized defacto marriages, and made adoption easier), but there i s s t i l l a long way to
go to change people’s attitudes and behaviors. (For Bank support in the area o f gender, see B o x 11.)

Despite some encouraging results, poverty remains deep and may not have been
3.
reduced in the rural areas, where 70% o f Mozambicans live. Rural per capita incomes
are believed to be about $100 per annum, or h a l f the national average. Some 59% o f
Mozambicans in the more rural north have to walk an hour to reach a health clinic (34%
in the more urban south); 72% o f rural Mozambicans are illiterate (33% urban); only one
in three rural people have access to a protected water source and in only one in forty have
electricity (compared to one in four urban dwellers). Most Mozambican farmers live on
fewer than three hectares o f land and only about one in ten i s able to sell surplus produce.
Poverty reduction strategy: In April 2001 the Council o f Ministers approved the
4.
PARPA for 2001-2005,’ and in August 2001 the Bank and Fund Boards endorsed it as
Mozambique’s first full PRSP. The PARPA’s public action strategy emphasizes
economic growth, public investment in human capital and productive infrastructure, and
institutional reform to improve the environment for private investment. Growth i s
expected to come from large-scale capital-intensive projects financed by private foreign
capital; productivity and value-added gains in agriculture and manufacturing; and a
general expansion in internal trade, transport and services. To implement this strategy,
the PARPA, in line with i t s poverty diagnosis, identifies six priority areas for action:
health, education, infrastructure, agriculture and rural development, governance, and
macroeconomic and financial policies. The P A R P A also identifies actionable measures
within each priority area and establishes targets and milestones in an operational matrix.

Bank and Fund staff in an August 2001 Joint Staff Assessment (JSA) compared
the PARPA to previous poverty reduction strategies and found that it increased country

Agenda 2025. The program has brought together many different interest groups and conducted
consultations in 118 o f 132 districts; the Threshold 2 1 model i s being used to provide quantitative support

macroeconomic policies,
institutional reforms and sectoral
programs The JSA also noted room
for further development o f the
poverty analysis (regarding gender,
H I V / A I D S and vulnerability to
exogenous shocks), and o f the
prioritization, sequencing and
implementation o f the policy actions
identified, which tend to focus o n
access to the relative exclusion o f
quality and efficiency. I t also identified a need to deepen and institutionalize the participatory process,
which the Government has begun
through the Poverty Observatory.
Recently the Government and its
partners also realized that the
PARPA progress indicators need to

reflect the M D G s (see Annex 3).

Economic Context and Issues

6.
Recent economic developments: A s a result o f peace, democracy, liberalization,
and prudent monetary and fiscal policies, Mozambique’s growth rate has been w e l l above
the African average and among the highest in the world. Despite a flood-induced drop to
1.6% in 2000, growth averaged 9% from 1997 to 2002, due to megaproject construction
and production, foreign investment, and strong agricultural performance. Mozambique’s
recovery fi-om the 2000 floods i s mostly complete. Economic growth was 8.3% in 2002
and i s projected at between 7% and 12% annually until 2005, with fluctuations mostly
due to megaproject construction. Macroeconomic models indicate that the $350 m i l l i o n
or so that Mozambique receives annually in external grant assistance accounts for about
five percentage points of annual growth. M u c h assistance consists in imports o f goods
and services and capacity building, w h i c h raise the productivity o f Mozambican residents
and businesses, though some takes the form o f budget support, o f which part i s spent o n
nontradables. While this tends to strengthen the exchange rate, there i s little evidence o f
undue strengthening, as agricultural products remain competitive o n world markets.
Inflation rose sharply following the 2000 floods and again in 2002. In M a y 2003,
7.
i t was 16%, due mainly to exogenous factors including a stronger rand, high o i l import
prices, and increased food prices due to the regional drought, but it i s expected to fall to

-3-

11% by December, provided that measures are taken to limit liquidity and recourse to
banking-sector financing for the budget. Tax reform and improved tax administration
have increased Government revenues to 14.2% o f GDP in 2002, exceeding expectations.
The fiscal deficit after grants remains high (7.9% o f GDP as o f 2002, including the cost
o f recapitalizing the banks) but it i s being financed primarily by grants and concessional
loans (7.0% financed externally, and 0.9% domestically).

Agriculture: Given the rural focus o f poverty, growth in agriculture will remain a
priority for the next five to ten years. Performance has been strong: agricultural
production grew faster than the overall economy since 1992, as a result o f liberalization,
macroeconomic stabilization, infrastructure rehabilitation, the return o f 1.5 m i l l i o n

* Over 2000-2002, Mozambique's CPIA rating for economic management deteriorated, because inflation

and the deficit after grants rose (due to the bank restructuring), while the rating for managing external debt
was lowered to bring it into line with other countries. A rise in the structural policy rating (due to ended
monopolies in telecommunications and air transportation) was not enough to compensate for this decline.

rehgees and 3.2 m i l l i o n displaced persons to the rural areas, and (until 2000) the absence
o f weather-related shocks to production. Input expansion was the k e y factor: since the
war’s end, the number o f farmers and the amount o f land farmed nearly doubled, with the
result that output also doubled. Nonetheless, smallholder farmers, though constituting
two-thirds o f Mozambique’s population, produce less than one-third o f GDP.
Productivity remains very l o w (the average cereal yield in Mozambique i s 948 kg/ha
compared to South Africa’s 2,604 kg/ha) and agribusiness i s still limited. W h i l e
production-for-subsistence has shifted partially to production-for-market since the end o f
the war, commercial production remains w e l l below 1970s levels and smallholders make
little use o f yield-improving inputs or improved farming systems and technologies.
Box 2: Agriculture in Mozambique
Mozambique i s endowed with about 39 million hectares (ha) o f water and forests and 36 m i l l i o n ha
o f arable land and pastures, o f which 4.0 to 4.5 million ha (or 11% to 12%) are presently cultivated. The
most important food crops are cereals: maize represents 70% o f the total cereal production, sorghum
18% and rice 11%. Export crops, such as cashew, cotton, sugar cane, tobacco and tea, take up about
25% o f the planted area. Economic reform, the partial rehabilitation o f rural infrastructure, and a rapid
post-conflict expansion in production, have stimulated a nascent, yet s t i l l small, agribusiness sector,
which i s presently focused o n cashew, cotton, sugar, tea, tobacco, paprika, pigeon pea and forestry
products. The reemergence o f agribusiness has permitted and encouraged a partial shift in the pattern
o f production away f r o m production-for-subsistence and towards production-for-market.
Since 1999, the W o r l d Bank and 17 other major donors have been supporting a five-year
comprehensive agricultural program, PROAGRI, which i s largely focused o n modernizing,
restructuring and decentralizing the Ministry o f Agriculture and Rural Development (MADER). T o
date, PROAGRI has: (i)
restructured MADER’s financial management and accounting system, (ii)
reformulated the planning and monitoring system, (iii)
initiated the decentralization o f some services to
the provincial and district levels, (iv) supported the development o f legal and regulatory instruments in
the land, forestry, irrigation, and crop sub-sectors, (v) initiated institutional reform in research and
extension, (vi) developed a strategy and action plan to streamline and modernize MADER’s human
resources department, (vii) aligned gender and environmental objectives and interventions into
strategies and work plans, and (viii) institutionalized coordination w i t h the private sector, other
ministries and territorial administration authorities.
M a n y challenges remain. Only 4% o f farmers use fertilizer and only 7% use any type o f pesticide,
with the result that yields remain very l o w by regional standards. Maize output per hectare averages
about 0.90 tonha, sorghum 0.60 tonha, rice l . l t o n h a , and cotton, 0.6 tonha, whereas neighboring
countries often achieve twice these yields. Although several crop varieties have been released and
adopted, due to the maintenance o f traditional production practices, their average yields remain limited
and overall crop quality (nutritional value and disease resistance) remains poor. Lack o f access to rural
credit also remains a k e y constraint affecting the entire profile o f agricultural producers and traders.

come mostly in resource-based extractive industries, or in sectors enjoying trade
preference or natural protection, where poor performance escapes competitive pressures.
M o s t local f i r m s lag regional competitors in skills, management, and manufacturing
techniques; and labor-intensive manufacturing that has served many developing countries
as export platforms (textiles, footwear) has not been able to compete. Moreover, linkages
to large-scale projects remain limited. Despite Government incentive^,^ the sector still
faces many challenges. In general, Mozambique remains a risky and difficult market: i t
i s poor and small; and it has high operating costs (due to poor infrastructure), l o w labor
productivity (low wages are offset by poor skills and health), and high transaction costs
(due to an inefficient bureaucracy). Labor inflexibility, high business registration costs,
and difficult access to land and capital are k e y factors inhibiting entry and the efficient
allocation o f resources as w e l l as contributing to l o w productivity and competitiveness.
Box 3: Two economies in Mozambique?
Since the end o f the conflict, Mozambique has successfully attracted large-scale projects to exploit
i t s mineral and energy resources. These have raised growth and export levels ($1 b i l l i o n in 2002),
helped establish Mozambique as an attractive destination for investment, and contributed t o the sales
revenues, productivity and quality standards o f some local firms. But to lift 20% o f the population out
of poverty, Mozambique needs to create 3.7 million jobs. Large-scale projects will not do it. On
present trends, a $10 b i l l i o n investment in large-scale projects would create only about 20,000 jobs
(5,000 in the companies and 15,000 among suppliers and service providers). That i s not nearly enough.
Mozambique also has thousands o f micro- and small-sized enterprises, employing fewer than 10, in
both the formal and the informal sector. They are concentrated in food, beverages, metallurgy and
minerals and there has been little recent investment. Sales stagnated in the last five years; most growth
has come in naturally-protected sectors (e.g. beverages), inresource-based extractive industries, or in
sectors enjoying trade preferences (e.g. garments for South Africa). M o s t firms are Mozambicanowned, sell to the local market, do not have the collateral to borrow money to expand, and lag behind
their regional competitors in skills levels, management practices and manufacturing techniques. They
contribute modestly to economic growth and exports, and they are poorly integrated with the large-scale
projects. Backward and forward linkages have started to increase-from a very l o w base-but there i s
potential for much more. T o grow, businesses need to improve their competitiveness to gain access to
export markets, as disposable incomes in Mozambique are low.
In the past five years, Mozambique has had a remarkable growth rate, averaging over 9% per year.
But much o f the recent growth has come f r o m foreign aid that has driven the construction b o o m and
pumped-up the service sector. In the early post-war period, industry saw rapid growth as idle capacity
was brought back on-line following the end o f the war, but most productive capacity has n o w been
restored. Industrial value-added grew 18 percent per year during the last five years, but most o f this
growth has come f r o m Mozal. In addition, growth has been concentrated in Maputo, in the extreme
south o f the country-creating
a second division between two economies. There i s clearly much scope
for increasing growth across a l l sectors o f the economy and reducing regional differences and
asymmetries.

11,
Trade: In the early 1990s, Mozambique was virtually a closed economy with
high tariff barriers, quantitative restrictions, and an inefficient customs system. M u c h
progress has been made since. The maximum tariff was reduced from 30% to 25% in
2003, and the 50-60% variable tariff o n sugar and the 18% tax o n raw cashews are n o w
Firms that export 100% o f output are exempt f r o m import duties and value-added tax (VAT); firms
engaging in new investments are exempt f r o m import duties and enjoy a 50% reduction in income tax for
up to 10 years; and investments to rehabilitate or expand existing operations can write-off 100% o f new
equipment costs. (None o f these arrangements contravene W o r l d Trade Organization rules on subsidies.)

the only significant trade barriers. Work continues on customs reform; reducing tariffs;
implementing the multi-year SADC plan for a free trade zone; promoting trade and
helping firms to exploit AGOA. Results to date have been mixed, w i t h the composition
of exports generally unchanged over 1997-2001 outside o f aluminum and electricity (see
Table 3). Trade barriers have not been a large impediment, but slow customs clearance
continues to be.6 In addition, exporters will not be able to recapture their pre-conflict
export markets unless they meet the product standards o f their trading partners; this has
occurred in fishing but the challenge in agro-processing and other areas remains large.

Core labor standards: According to the 1997 census, 10% o f Mozambique’s 5.9
12.
million workers were employed in the formal sector, which i s mostly concentrated in the
cities, and less than 1% were unionized. Mozambique’s constitution forbids forced labor
(the Government ratified ILO Convention 1OS), guarantees equal opportunity and nondiscrimination in employment, and allows for freedom o f association including the right
to strike. Minimum wage legislation exists, covering urban and rural workers; the
schedule o f minimum wages i s adjusted annually by a tripartite commission composed o f
labor unions, government and employer groups, but enforcement does not extend beyond
the formal sector. While Mozambique has not signed ILO Convention 182 o n the Worst
The SADC Free Trade Agreement framework involves reducing tariff, non-tariff and other technical
barriers to trade, customs reforms, licensing and border procedures. Tariffs o n intermediates w i l l fall to
zero by 2008 and all tariffs on finished goods to zero by 2012.
I t takes 10 to 11 days to clear imports and exports in the Maputo port, and 11 to 20 days in ports in the
center and north, while the average reported time to clear a truck from South Africa i s almost seven days,
negating the advantage o f close proximity to South African markets.

-7-

Forms o f C h i l d Labor, the 1999 labor law forbids all labor by children under 15 and
regulates the pay, hours, and working conditions o f children under 18, yet children under
15 are frequently employed in domestic service, agriculture and the informal sector, as
the authorities lack the ability to monitor and enforce the law.

Medium-Term Economic Outlook and External Environment
13.
Sustaining broad-based growth while keeping inflation l o w and improving service
delivery are central elements o f the Government’s medium-tenn poverty-reduction
strategy. Prospects are good for maintaining annual GDP growth rates at 7% to 11% and
bringing inflation below 10% over the medium-term (2004-06). Continued growth will
require the Government to maintain a prudent fiscal and monetary stance, improve the
investment climate, and encourage the development o f a strong export base. The current
economic slowdown in Mozambique’s main trading partners-South Africa, Europe and
the United States-is not expected to constrain exporters, whose chief problems l i e
elsewhere (high interest rates, red tape, and poor infrastructure). Domestic fiscal
imbalances will gradually be reduced, but sustained external assistance and revenue
growth resulting f r o m a growing economy will permit continued pro-poor expenditures.
Mozambique should also be able gradually to reduce its aid dependency.

14.
Sources ofgrowth: In the base case economic scenario, small-holder agriculture,
large-scale commercial agriculture, and manufacturing across all sectors and in nontraditional areas i s expected to continue to grow and create jobs, while deeper regulatory
reform should encourage investment in infrastructure (see Table 4). Assuming no further
adverse exogenous shocks and continued satisfactory implementation o f the reform
program, large-scale project construction ( M o z a l 2 and the gas and titanium sand
developments) will drive growth in the near term and also explain i t s m a i n fluctuations.
A s these projects begin their productive activities, they will also help to expand and

diversify the export base, bring growth to local enterprises through upstream and
downstream linkages, and create significant spin-off effects, such as employee training,
connected infrastructure developments, and higher Government tax revenues that can
support pro-poor spending. Hydroelectric power exports will also contribute to growth,
and current prospecting suggests that coal, petroleum and mineral resources may
contribute in the long term. If sustainably managed, Mozambique’s agro-ecological
resources will remain a good basis for economic expansion. Agricultural growth i s
expected to remain strong, at almost 8% per annum, with rapid expansion in tobacco and
sugar (the latter behind protective barriers), as only a fifth o f arable land i s now cultivated
and there i s ample scope for yield improvements, including through irrigation. With a
2,700 km coast that has many unique habitats, tourism i s expected to remain one o f
Mozambique’s fastest growing industries and to continue expanding vigorously (luxury
hotel rooms in Maputo increased from 730 in 1999 to 1,370 in 2003). Services,
stemming in part from government expenditure, will also continue to expand in the
medium term, particularly in transportation, accommodation, and food.
Continued growth will require a second generation o f reforms designed to
15,
improve agricultural productivity, expand labor-intensive manufacturing and services,
and redistribute public spending towards poverty-reducing sectors, including health,
education, water supply, and basic infrastructure. To grow over the medium- to longterm, i t i s especially important that Mozambican f i r m s become more competitive in
world markets. As shown in the 2001 Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) and
other research, for Mozambique to take full advantage o f identified sources o f growth,
the Government should act decisively in five areas (see also Annex 4):
Strengthening the macroeconomic environment: Mozambique needs to reduce i t s
fiscal deficit, improve public expenditure management, reform and strengthen the
financial sector, and strengthen i t s external balance by expanding the export base and
raising manufacturing and cash-crop exports back to pre-independence levels.
Unleashing agriculture ’s poverty-reducing potential: Mozambique needs to improve
land tenure, expand access to key agricultural inputs, and facilitate rural trade by
expanding road transportation.
Removing the impediments to private sector growth: The investment climate,
particularly for high-potential sectors such as transport, tourism, and labor-intensive
manufacturing, needs to be improved through removing administrative barriers and
increasing private- sect or-participation in infrastructure.
Improving human capital: Improving health services, expanding access to education,
and controlling HIV and malaria are key to improving skills and productivity levels.
Protecting natural resources: T o maximize returns from natural resource extraction,
Mozambique needs to strengthen i t s environmental institutions and policies in ways
that promote growth and protect the environment, focusing o n resource usage rights,
fisheries, forest management, artisanal mining, and water resource management.

16.
Exfernalfiutancing: Continued and stable support in the form o f bilateral and
multilateral grants and credits will be needed to enable Mozambique to meet i t s
development objectives. Excluding large-scale projects, Mozambique requires about

-9-

$650 m i l l i o n per annum in external assistance (see Table 5). At the October 2003
Consultative Group meeting, Mozambique's external partners pledged $790 m i l l i o n in
external assistance for 2004 (75% in grants, and 40% in budget support), which i s more
than enough to meet the country's financing requirements for that year, Reliance on aid
flows i s projected to decline gradually over the next decade, as strong growth and
increased private sector financing reduce aid's share o f GDP and o f the budget.

Debt sustainability and I D A lending: Mozambique's debt i s high but has been
17.
reduced to sustainable levels. In 2002 the Government paid $52 m i l l i o n in debt service,
o f which $39 m i l l i o n were domestic interest payments. Public debt o f $2.7 billion (57%
o f total external debt) i s mostly long-term debt owed to governments and multilateral
institutions. The Bank i s Mozambique's largest creditor, holding $1.O billion. Total
public external debt i s about 75% o f GDP (end-2002), compared to 170% in 1997, or
t w o times 2002 exports o f goods and services. Although domestic debt i s much smaller
than external debt, i t entails three times the interest obligations as a result o f very high
domestic interest rates. Mozambique reached the H I P C completion point in June 1999
and the enhanced H I P C completion point in September 2001, thereby receiving debt

Regional context: Though i t s economy i s more inwardly-oriented than i t s
18.
neighbors’ , Mozambique’s dependence on regional trade and investment flows i s high,
and regional developments can significantly influence the pace and sustainability o f i t s
o w n development. Trade flows with South Africa are the most important, representing
15% o f exports and 40% o f imports in 2001. Malawi i s expected to continue importing
maize from Mozambique’s northern provinces, and Zimbabwe will continue to be a drag
o n regional economic performance as long as it remains in turmoil. Mozambique has
signed or ratified the SADC treaty and numerous sectoral protocols7 and in December
1999 i t ratified the SADC trade protocol, which aims to establish a free trade area in
southern Africa, both reflecting and giving greater momentum to regional integration.
With political stability and greater investor confidence, Mozambique has also become a
more attractive destination for investors from South Africa and other countries.

19.
Regional cooperation i s emerging in power, transportation, and water resource
management. The Cahora Bassa hydroelectric facility supplies power to South Africa
and Zimbabwe, and further integration i s possible, as Mozambique belongs to the South
African Power Pool (SAPP) and owns the main transmission l i n e (interconnections with
Malawi and Tanzania are planned); gas fields are also being developed at Pembe and
Temane and coal-mining i s being considered at Moatize. Road, rail and port rehabilitation o n the Maputo, Beira and Nampula corridors (SADC spatial development initiatives)
has increased interdependence between Mozambique and its neighbors. Following the
2000 and 2001 floods, it also became clear that Mozambique needs to negotiate water
resource management with i t s upstream neighbors who, since the 1970s, have diverted
water from several cross-border rivers for irrigation and other uses, interfering with
Mozambique’s use. Regional cooperation o n watershed management and hydrologic and
climatic monitoring i s also essential for natural disaster mitigation. The SAPP, by
enabling the delinkage o f hydroelectric production from individual reservoir control, has
also created opportunities for improving flood control. Finally, long-term tourism
potential i s high, though, due to limited destination development, in the medium-term it i s
likely to depend o n encouraging add-on visits to tours transiting through South Africa,
Tanzania or another one o f its neighbors with a more developed tourism industry.

THE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT AND GOVERNANCE
20.
Mozambique has made progress in governance since 1992. Peace and democracy
have been increasingly established. Presidential and legislative elections were held in
1994 and 1999 and local elections in 1998. FRELIMO emerged as the victor in all these
elections, which the international community considered free and fair, and i t holds 133 o f
250 parliamentary seats, enabling i t to pass any motion it chooses. The remaining 117
seats belong to a coalition including RENAMO (99 seats) and several smaller parties.
Women hold one in four seats, a very high ratio by international standards. While
competition for power continues and mistrust and violence occasionally arise, the r i s k o f
resumption o f c i v i l unrest and instability i s considered to be low.

’

These include the SADC political and security protocols as w e l l as sectoral protocols related to shared
watercourses, trade, energy, education, mining, tourism, health, fisheries, wildlife conservation, and l a w
enforcement. Unusually for the region, Mozambique has not signed onto any other regional organizations.

- 11 -

2 1.
N e w municipal elections are scheduled for November 2003 and n e w presidential
and legislative elections for late 2004. President Joaquim Chissano, approaching the end
o f his second term, will not stand as a candidate, and FRELIMO has already identified
Armando Guebuza to take his place. H e will oppose Afonso Dhlakama, RENAMO’s
presidential candidate in the last two elections. As the main parties espouse similar
principles, policy i s expected to be broadly continuous, no matter who wins, though the
presence in government o f new officials m a y result in transition-related inefficiencies.

22.
Economic governance remains weak, and corruption i s a growing concern (see
B o x 4). C i v i l service capacity i s constrained by small numbers, l o w education, limited
private-sector experience, and l o w morale resulting from poor pay. Compared to other
African countries, the state i s thinly spread and has difficulty delivering services and
enforcing legislation in every district; in addition ancillary functions such as legal,
accounting and audit services are weak. M o r e generally, bureaucratic processes remain
cumbersome. For all these reasons, public sector reform i s a Government priority.
Box 4: Anti-CorruptionActivities in Mozambique
Corruption, which involves the use o f public office for private gain, remains a major issue in
Mozambique, where large businesses frequently lobby senior officials to resolve problems and s m a l l
businesses pay bribes to petty officials to avoid fines related to obscure outdated regulations. While
Mozambique compares well w i t h low-income and other African countries in political stability,
government effectiveness, and rule o f law, it compares poorly in controlling corruption, where relative
performance has actually declined since 1996.
The Government i s committed to minimizing corruption. I t s anti-corruption strategy involves
setting ethical standards, reorganizing institutions to minimize opportunity for corruption, and
strengthening investigatory and prosecutory agencies. The Government i s currently establishing a
working committee to update the October 2001 anti-corruption strategy in light o f a national corruption
survey that the Government i s undertaking with DFID and WBI assistance. I t i s also promoting policy
and administrative reforms in known corruption-prone areas such as the judiciary, the police, public
financial management, public procurement, privatisation, customs, and tax administration. In
particular, the Ministry o f Justice (MoJ), Administrative Court, Supreme Court, and Attorney General’s
Office have finalized an overall reform plan, to be implemented through 2006; the M o J has established
an Anti-Corruption Unit; and an anti-corruption l a w was passed in 2003.
M a n y Bank activities have anti-corruption impacts. The Public Sector Reform project aims to
improve public servant pay and promotions, which will help to reduce incentives for corruption. IDA
project support to private-sector participation in service delivery (in urban water supply, ports, railways,
and telecommunications) as w e l l as to improved financial controls (in financial management and
procurement, both centrally and sectorally through the SWAps), decrease opportunities for corruption
by increasing transparency. Project support for decentralization to municipalities and to district
authorities helps to increase public oversight, and support for legal and judicial reform helps to make
investigatory and prosecutory agencies more effective; these too help to discourage corrupt practices.

tracking indicators and implemented or initiated 80% o f the measures in i t s action plan.
Thus, public expenditure management continues to require substantial upgrading. In
December 2001, a Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) found that,
until the system i s strengthened, the risk o f waste, diversion and misuse o f funds remains
high. The CFAA also found that material receipts and payments are excluded from the
budget and from Government accounting and reporting systems; accounting systems and
standards are outdated; internal auditing, external auditing, and parliamentary oversight
remain weak; and so financial management continues to involve a high fiduciary risk.

PROGRESS UNDER THE PARPA AND THE PREVIOUS CAS

25.
In the absence o f a full PRSP, the previous C A S (June 2000) was based o n the
Government’s Five Year Program for 2000-2004, which incorporated the PARPA for
2000-2004, a document endorsed by the Bank and Fund Boards in M a r c h 2000 as the
country’s interim PRSP. A s noted in the C A S Completion Report (CASCR, see Annex
2), the June 2002 C A S pillars were identical to the pillars o f the Five Year Program and
C A S performance indicators and targets reflected the monitoring plan incorporated in the
Program and the PARPA. Progress made towards the C A S outcomes can therefore b e
assessed in conjunction with achievement o f the overall poverty reduction objectives
defined in the Government’s strategy documents. Following preparation o f the June
2000 CAS, the Government’s strategy was further articulated in the PARPA 2001-2005,
completed in April 2001 and endorsed by the Bank and Fund Boards in August 2001 as
the country’s first full PRSP. In April 2003, the Government completed a f i r s t Progress
Report and in June and July 2003, the Fund and Bank Boards found that Mozambique’s
efforts to implement the PARPA manifest its commitment to poverty reduction and that
the PARPA continues to provide a sound basis for concessional assistance.

Box 5: World Bank assistance to Mozambique’s rural development
Since most Mozambicans live in the rural areas as subsistence farmers, agriculture and rural
development are central to poverty reduction. Agriculture w i l l only improve rural incomes if there are
productivity and unit-value increases in the products that farmers produce, and increases in farm
productivity depend o n public investment and institutional reform in research and extension, the
adoption o f new crops and new farming technologies, and greater access to credit. In addition, because
most farmers have limited interaction with markets, i t i s also important to invest in rural roads and to
connect the farming provinces to developed markets in Maputo, Beira and elsewhere. The Bank i s
helping through various instruments.
Through a $30 million credit, IDA i s one o f 18 donors supporting PROAGRI, which aims to
rationalize MADER, decentralize functions, and strengthen extension services. T o date, PROAGRI has
provided MADER with vehicles, equipment, supplies, and technical assistance; helped to repair
irrigation systems; outsourced some extension and veterinary services to private providers; and
advanced decentralization (Provincial Directorates prepare budgets, procure goods and services, and
distribute funds to the districts, and districts in turn prepare budgets and procure equipment and
supplies), Bank support will continue for P R O A G R I 2, through the PRSC, when the focus i s expected
to shift to providing more direct support to farmers to achieve results o n the ground.
The Bank Group i s also supporting the development o f agribusiness, mostly through E S W aiming to
identify agricultural export potential for private investors. Building o n the recently-completed
Investment Climate Assessment as well as USAID’s Mainstreaming Trade Report (which analyzes
trade standards, border trade liberalization, and the importance o f regional and extra-regional trade),
IDA and I F C are jointly supporting an agro-industry investment conference for February 2004 which
will aim, inter alia, to increase value-added in k e y commodities and expand their market access.
Targeted products may include soy beans, milled rice, and citrus f r u i t s for South Africa; processed
cassava, pigeon peas and macadamia nuts for other regional markets; and processed cashews for the
international market. Collaboration with other successful supporters o f agribusiness, such as
Technoserve, will be key.
Bank support to rural development also includes numerous sector investment projects that have
positive rural impacts. National Water Development 1 has helped to rehabilitate or construct more than
1,500 rural standpipes in 2001-02. The Education and Health Sector Recovery projects have rural
components that are supporting infrastructure rehabilitation in these critically-important sectors, and the
Higher Education project i s supporting distance education into the provinces. IDA i s also financing
improved transportation to help link rural inhabitants to clinics, schools and markets: Roads and
Bridges 1 i s connecting all provincial capitals to the all-season road network, enabling Roads and
Bridges 2 (the second phase o f the IDA APL, which i s already under preparation) to focus o n
rehabilitating k e y secondary and tertiary roads; while the railway projects are helping to connect remote
rural areas to r a i l transportation. In addition, the recently-approved Energy Reform project w i l l help to
pilot programs for scaling-up rural access to electrical energy.
The Bank i s also supporting the decentralization o f development planning, financing and
management. Following the example o f the Municipal Development project, which focuses o n urban
authorities, the Decentralized Planning and Finance project will help to improve community
participation in district-level planning, project execution, and M&E by providing capacity-building
support and limited grant resources to as many as 49 districts in four o f the poorest provinces in the
country.
Though much w o r k i s being done to promote rural development, by the Bank and other donors,
there are also significant challenges. These include: expanding rural access to finance; improving
diffusion o f productivity-improving agricultural technologies; determining tariff policy; setting
agricultural standards; and improving key agribusiness supply chains. In FY04, the Bank will complete
AAA w i t h the Government and donors such as U S A I D to help prepare PROAGRI 2 and develop an
integrated rural development strategy for Mozambique. Investment support i s expected to follow in
FY05 with a Sustainable Rural Development project. The Bank i s also undertaking AAA o n regional
water resource management (focused o n the Zambezi catchment area) as well as a Poverty and Social
Impact Analysis (PSIA), for example, o n land marketability or the poverty implications o f various trade
reform measures n o w under consideration. In addition, the new C E M (FY06) i s expected to include
focus o n sustainable growth and natural resource management, including land, forests, fisheries, and
coastal marine resources.

for inflation and poverty-spending allocations;* on current trends, i t i s possible that
Mozambique will meet the poverty MDG. Bank support in this area has been
coordinated with the Fund and has included the Economic Management and Public
Sector Operation (EMPSO), two PERs, and extensive AAA and technical assistance o n
the banking sector. EMPSO’s $60 m i l l i o n second tranche has not yet disbursed, though
three conditions have been met and the five pending conditions are nearing completion.’
The PARPA Progress Report indicates that agricultural production rose in 200127.
02 (cereals by 5%, cashews and cotton by 12%, and sugar by 172%), but i t i s not clear
that better policies or services to farmers explain these gains, which m a y reflect a
recovery from the 2000 floods, or what role PROAGRI has had (the agriculture SWAP i s
supported by an IDA credit and 17 other donors, and i t aims to rationalize MADER,
decentralize functions, and strengthen extension services). Even so, rising incomes and
agricultural production suggest that Mozambique may meet the hunger MDG.
28.
Infrastructure development, which i s helping to connect rural areas to markets and
services, has been mixed. Road maintenance in 2001-02, supported by I D A ’ s Roads and
Bridges credit,) achieved only 65% o f the target, due partly to flood-recovery related
expenditures and partly to funding shortfalls and unsystematic maintenance scheduling,
but the Maputo and Nacala r a i l and port systems have been concessioned with the support
o f IDA’s Railway and Port Restructuring project and communications reform progressed
satisfactorily, with IDA support, through issuance o f a second mobile license, preparation
for TdM’s privatization, bidding for the Maputo airport concession, and restructuring at
LAM. Reform intended to make the electricity parastatal financially viable and to extend
the grid i s starting with IDA assistance from the Energy project, approved in August
2003. Finally, given the importance o f managing w e l l Mozambique’s environmental
resources, the Bank i s using IDA and GEF grant resources to support a Transfrontier
Conservation Areas project; a Coastal and Marine Biodiversity project; and a Mineral
Resource Management project, which are helping reach the environment MDG.
29.
Service delivery improvements have been mixed. The Progress Report shows that
Mozambique will achieve universal EPI enrolment (grades 1-5) by 2005 but i s unlikely to
achieve universal completion by 2015 (a k e y MDG). Despite more teacher training and
donor support enabling increased recurrent spending (17 donors support the sector, and in
January, after IDA’Scredit was already fully committed, six began using a common
funding mechanism with IDA procedures), the primary system remains inefficient and
even the gender MDG m a y b e out o f reach. The PARPA incorporates the Government’s

The inflation target was missed due to monetary expansion and several exogenous factors; the povertyspending allocations may have been too ambitious.
An assessment o f BIM has been done; a strategic legal sector reform plan has been done; and investment
advisers for LAM have been appointed. About 75% o f off-budget revenues were included in the 2003
budget; donor finding i s being included; the assessment o f banking sector compliance with international
prudential regulations i s underway; an audit o f the state-owned insurance company i s nearing completion

strategic health plan, which aims to improve primary health care as w e l l as combat
tuberculosis, malaria, leprosy and HIV/AIDS, with the support o f IDA’S Health credit;
significant improvements have been recorded (in attended births, vaccination coverage,
and infant and maternal mortality), though major challenges remain due to still-limited
coverage and the magnitude o f the A I D S challenge; o n current trends, the health M D G s
will not be met. The PARPA also incorporates the national plan to combat HIV/AIDS,
which aims to contain the infection rate and mitigate i t s effects by targeting high-risk
people with preventive measures; though information campaigns have been completed,
24 testing and counseling offices created, and the IDA H I V / A I D S project approved,
trends suggest the MDG will be missed. Finally, while Mozambique m a y achieve i t s
2005 target o f increasing overall access to safe water to 45%, with 1,500 rural standpipes
rehabilitated or constructed over 2001-02 and a private urban water supply operator
having substantially improved water reliability and quality in five cities (with support
from I D A ’ s National Water Development credits), the MDG i s likely to b e missed.

30.
The PARPA also stresses the importance o f good governance to poverty
reduction, and progress i s being made. IDA’s Public Sector Reform grant i s helping to
restructure ministries and reform civil-servant pay to promote better performance, while
its Decentralized Planning and Finance and Municipal Development projects are helping
to decentralize planning and management functions to local authorities o n a “leam by
doing” basis. Legal and judicial reform has been initiated, aiming to raise the capacity,
efficiency and transparency o f the system and increase its ability to respond to private
sector needs. The public financial management system i s also being modemized to
increase transparency, improve controls, and decentralize planning and execution.

Lessons Learned and Recommendations

32.
The PARPA Progress Report contains a number o f important recommendations to
the Government, including that the Government Economic and Social Plan (PES, i.e. i t s
semi-annual operational document) and budget execution reports should have matrices o f
programs and strategies reflecting the PARPA priorities to facilitate implementation and
monitoring; and that the number o f actions in the PARPA should be reduced to eliminate
low-priority activities, improve focus, and facilitate implementation and monitoring. In
addition, the JSA recommends that the Government support future activities o f the
Poverty Observatory by establishing an intersectoral interministerial working group
headed by the MPF for monitoring and evaluating progress in PARPA implementation;
and that it begin a systematic process to improve the statistical basis for economic and
social planning and evaluation. Work i s already underway.
A t the same time, implementation o f the current CAS, the CASCR, and the April
33.
and August 2003 Country Portfolio Performance Reviews (CPPRs) indicate some lessons
and recommendations for the Bank Group:
The Bank needs to be more strategic and selective in its engagement, focusing i t s

limited resources on fewer areas and o n specific transformative outcomes. While the
Bank should continue to play a broad role as an analytic and strategic partner to the
Government, especially in sector analysis and policy and program design, it needs to
be much more selective in i t s financing, as i t s resources are limited.
Bank projects need to be simplified to ensure a betterfit with the Government's
limited implementation capacity. Projects succeed only if the Government and i t s
partners agree on key policy reforms and maintain focus throughout implementation.

- 17 -

Recurring cross-cutting implementation risks need to be realistically assessed and
consistently addressed, where this implies adequate follow-up through the country

dialogue, well-funded project supervision, and high- and technical-level CPPRs.
The Bank Group can do much better to monitor its own results, both at the project
and program level, and to help the Government to monitor PARPA results.
Outcomes and indicators can be better aligned to the PARPA and the MDGs; the
M&E emphasis can be shifted more fully from inputs and processes to outcomes; and
established M&E systems can be strengthened.
Partners need to work harder to align their support with the PARPA and to build
the Government’s own systems. Operationalizing the Rome Declaration on donor
harmonization will result in greater organization and complementarity in each sector,
lesser demands o n Government capacity, and improved fiscal management.

Portfolio Performance under the Previous CAS
The Bank’s portfolio expanded under the previous CAS, as t e n projects were
34.
approved and eight were closed as o f September 30,2003. At end-FY03, commitments
amounted to $1.069 billion ($8 1 million grants, $73 1 million undisbursed). O f the
planned projects, eight were executed as expected, although project design and financing
amounts were sometimes changed in light o f new developments and two were
significantly delayed.’’ T w o other projects were introduced into the program after the
CAS was presented: the Communications project was prepared to take advantage o f an
unexpected opportunity to liberalize air traffic and telecommunications, thereby helping
to lower business transaction costs, and the HIV/AIDS project was prepared to address
the HIV emergency. For more details, see Appendix 2 o f the CASCR. Following weaker
perfomance and l o w proactivity over FYO1-02 (see CAS Annex B2), portfolio
implementation i s now largely o n track. All projects are currently in satisfactory status
except Coastal and Marine Biodiversity, which was downgraded due to procurement
delays, l o w disbursements, and weak financial and M&E performance; at i t s recent midterm review, the project was restructured and an upgrade to satisfactory status i s expected
on the next supervision mission. There has been 100% proactivity in FY03.
35.
Fiduciary risk remains a concern, and to mitigate this risk, IDA has sometimes
established project management units or ‘ring-fenced’ Bank projects, but because these
practices are inconsistent with building capacity, they are being discontinued. IDA
projects are also invariably audited by a reputable intemational audit firm, and audit
compliance has been improving (87% o f audit reports were submitted for fiscal 2002,
compared to 84% in 2001 and 69% for the A h c a Region as a whole) and audit data also
show stronger fiduciary compliance over 2002. In April and August 2003, the Bank and
the Government also completed CPPRs and agreed detailed action plans, both to improve
lo
The eight delivered as expected were EMPSO, Coastal and Marine Biodiversity, Roads and Bridges 1,
Municipal Development, Mineral Resource Management (called “Natural Resource Management” at CAS
presentation), Energy Reform, Higher Education (formerly “Skills Development”), Public Sector Reform
(formerly “Public Sector and Legal Reform”). The Decentralized Planning and Finance project (“Rural
Action” at CAS presentation) was delayed due to difficulties in establishing the required legal and
institutional framework and the Energy Reform project due to slow Cabinet approval for private
participation in EdM.

performance in projects that were then in unsatisfactory status, and to address crosscutting causes o f underperformance, including weak procurement, financial management,
and M&E. Further CPPRs are planned for December 2003 and April 2004 to keep the
spotlight on portfolio implementation and ensure that recent gains hold.
Box 6: Country AAA program review
Mozambique i s one o f three countries that piloted a Q A G effort to assess the quality o f AAA at
the country level. The July 2002 assessment, which examined twelve individual AAA tasks
completed in FY01-02, found that the overall quality was satisfactory, with the PER, the CFAA, and
a public sector reform activity rated highly satisfactory.
The review panel noted several strengths: the program showed strong symmetry w i t h CAS
objectives, the lending operations, and each other; pieces were timely and opportune, resulting in
high impact o n government policies and programs; key pieces (the CEM, PER, CFAA and CPAR)
were effectively clustered in terms o f timing and substance; and the program responded to country
priorities, including new developments (as it introduced non-programmed activities-including a
financial sector study, an H I V / A I D S study, and an education financing study-as the need arose).
The panel also found that the program could have been improved, by improving dissemination o f
completed pieces; by completing as planned critical pieces o f AAA that were postponed (e.g. the
legal and judicial assessment, completed in mid-2003, and a rural development study that was
recently initiated) rather than engaging in an ad hoc rebalancing as new developments occurred; and
by seeking to mobilize resources to fund overdue AAA that has not yet been funded. While
coordination with the donors and the Government was strong, local participation was weak; in this
context, the panel recommended a more systematic and participatory effort to identify knowledge
gaps and explore avenues o f collaboration. The panel also found that formal AAA was subject to a
sound quality assurance process, but it expressed concern about analytical work outside the AAA
stream (in the review period, o n roads, mining, water supply, and c i v i l service pay reform), which
seemed to receive relatively little attention or inputs from beyond the task teams.

Remaining Challenges

36.

Important development challenges to achieve the results identified as part o f this
CAS l i e ahead. In particular:

The main challenge continues to be extending the benefits of economic growth to all
Mozambicans, particularly the poor. This CAS aims to help keep growth above 7%
per annum (the rate attained during the past decade and indicated in the PARPA to be
necessary to impact poverty) and distribute i t s benefits in an equitable manner.
Improvingprivate sector competitiveness and productivity i s also key. The Bank has
helped to establish several large-scale projects, but small- and medium-sized industry
i s stagnating and generating few new jobs. Constraints to their growth include the
high cost o f credit, insecure land rights, labor market inflexibility, and high infrastructure costs. These constraints are most evident in agriculture, where work needs
to be done to improve farmers’ productivity and the generation o f off-farm income.
Rationalizing the use of natural resources: Ad hoc management o f Mozambique’s
land, water, forests, coastal and biodiversity assets does not ensure rational use and
sustainability; and degradation i s a growing problem. Through institutional and
regulatory strengthening as well as community involvement in zoning, land-titling,
and concessioning, there i s scope to attract larger-scale growth-promoting investment
and also to include community participation in their benefits.

- 19-

While achieving universal access to basic health and educational services remains a
challenge, ensuring adequate quality of services is an even greater challenge, which
also has a direct impact o n sustainability. With poor quality, numeracy, literacy,
better health, and higher productivity will fail to be realized.
Government capacity and accountability structures are improving, but need to
improve even more to enable the Government to take leadership o f i t s development

program, and the Bank needs to do a better j o b o f helping to make improvements.

THE COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
Consultativeprocess: This C A S i s based o n extensive consultations with country
37.
team members and other stakeholders, including the Government, NGOs, the private
sector, opinion leaders, and the donors. Internally, IDA, IFC and MIGA held several
rounds o f all-day strategy meetings between August 2002 and July 2003. A first round o f
consultations with external stakeholders was held in December 2002 and a second round,
based o n a draft o f this CAS, in August 2003. Discussions focused o n the Bank's
experience implementing the previous C A S as w e l l as o n strategic choices confronting
the Bank over the next few years. The country's o w n development priorities were not
discussed, as these are articulated in the PARPA, which the C A S supports and which was
itself based o n extensive discussions. Bank staff worked closely with the key donors,
including particularly the G11 and those that are preparing new country strategies." The
C A S also drew extensively o n the first (full-day) meeting o f the Poverty Observatory,
opened by President Chissano in April 2003; this meeting discussed implementation o f
the PARPA with the active participation o f ten Cabinet Ministers and representatives o f
local government, NGOs, the private sector, the faith community, and the donors.

38.
The Country Team will promote wider understanding o f the C A S by publishing it
o n the country website and in a shorter user-fhendly brochure as w e l l as through periodic
public lectures given by Bank staff and the Country Director's regular press briefings.
The Country Office i s also implementing a n e w communications strategy designed to
improve information disclosure and obtain more frequent and actionable feedback; as
part o f that strategy, the office has hired a Communications Officer, created a Public
Information Center, and entered into arrangements with the University o f Eduardo
Mondlane and public libraries to provide them with Bank materials (several are n o w
repositories for Bank publications). Finally, the Bank Group has established several
continuous feedback mechanisms to help improve C A S follow-up, including an annual
CPPR process (including a Cabinet-level discussion o f the portfolio); quarterly CPPR
follow-up meetings with Project Directors; and monthly meetings with the Minister o f
Finance and the Governor o f the Central Bank o n the Bank's portfolio, including AAA.
The Poverty Observatory and the PRSC review process that i s being established will also
be important mechanisms for getting continuous feedback o n Bank performance.

'I A group o f 11 donors (G1l),
including Belgium, the Europe Aid, Denmark, Ireland, Finland, France,
Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, supports a Joint Programme for
Macro-Financial Support (JPMFS); four other donors (Germany, Italy, Portugal and Spain) are expected to
j o i n soon, creating a group o f 15 (G15).

- 20 -

Government-Bank Group differences: While the Bank and the Government
39.
broadly agree o n the overall direction o f reform, as set out in the PARPA, they differ in
places about the pace and scope. In particular, the Government favors labor regulations,
including foreign hire restrictions, that the Bank believes hinder competitiveness and
limit j o b creation; the Government i s reluctant to reform the politically-charged area o f
land use rights, whereas the Bank believes reform i s inevitable and favors more marketable rights in order to realize allocative efficiencies; some parts o f Govemment (though
not all) are reluctant to proceed with the divestiture o f particular state-owned enterprises,
due to vested interests, or concems about the buy side o f the market, or disappointment
with some earlier divestitures, which failed to realize expected retums in investment,
domestic product and j o b creation; and the Govemment prefers moderate reforms in the
legal and judicial sector, while the Bank favors more proactive action, including
restructuring of the sector institutions. Though its country dialogue and AAA, the Bank
i s working with the Government and other donors to help reduce these differences.

Strategic Selectivity

This new C A S proposes a continuation and deepening o f past B a n k efforts, which
40.
remain appropriate in overall design and orientation. A s in past CASs, this C A S aims to
help improve the investment climate, expand service delivery (to businesses and to the
poor), and build public-sector capacity and accountability structures, so that firms are
encouraged to expand and create jobs and the poor are equipped to take advantage o f the
economic opportunities that are available to them. I t will also help the Government to
improve its C P I A and H I P C expenditure-tracking ratings in the areas where Mozambique
i s weak.12 The k e y strategic shifts between this C A S and the previous C A S include:
A much sharper focus on managing for results. This C A S aims m u c h more
explicitly to leam from past experience (see the CASCR, Annex 2) and to articulate
clear and monitorable expected results (see the Results Framework, Table 7 and
Annex 1) that have been agreed with the Government and that can f o r m a more
objective basis for ex-post learning and performance assessment.
Closer alignment with the PARPA and better harmonization with the donors.
The Bank will w o r k m u c h more closely with the Government and Mozambique’s
other extemal partners to articulate a jointly-agreed results framework for the overall
Government-donor partnership. T o do so, the Bank will begin to support the PARPA
through a series o f Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs). It will align the
PRSC process with the Government’s budgetary calendar and systems and it will
condition successive PRSC operations, to the greatest extent possible, o n achievement
o f an explicit set o f indicators that i s agreed with the Government and with other
donors and that will also condition the budget support provided by those other donors.

l2Mozambique lowest CPIA ratings concern the financial sector (indicator 6) and accountability,
transparency and corruption in the public sector (20). There i s also r o o m for substantial improvement in
five other areas, viz. financial sector depth, efficiency and resource mobilization (7); factor and productive
markets (9); policies and institutions for environmental sustainability (10); property rights and rule-based
governance (13); and social protection and labor (14).

An increased emphasis on improving governance. Good govemance and the rule
o f l a w are critical for private-sector-led growth, and advantageous for the poor. This
C A S seeks improved results in specific expenditure-management indicators and also
deepens the Bank’s support for capacity-building and for legal and judicial reform.

41.
In line with this strategic shift, the PRSC will become a k e y financing instrument
in this CAS. Mozambique i s ready to transition to a PRSC. I t has a good growth record,
and provisional data show that the poverty headcount has fallen. The Government has
demonstrated progress in PARPA implementation as w e l l as continuing commitment to
improving govemance and expenditure management. I t also has several relatively deep
sectoral programs which, to promote donor harmonization with Government programs,
should be mainstreamed instead o f ringfenced (as they are now). The PRSCs will also
empower MPF to allocate resources in line with PARPA priorities, rather than abdicating
this responsibility to the donors-an overdue step that i s also a logical development from
the SWAP experience. Besides reducing IDA’s transaction costs and saving Government
capacity, the PRSC will also help to shift the partnership model from one where accountability flows from Government to donors to one where the Government i s accountable to
parliament and the people o f Mozambique through i t s PARPA reporting processes.
Box 7: The Government of Mozambique’s Performance Assessment Framework (PAF)
Since early 2003, the Government, the Bank and the G11 donors have been trying to develop a single
monitoring process and an agreed financing plan around the Government’s own procedures and documents,
including i t s budget execution reports, the PARPA, and the Economic and Social Plan (PES). I t has been
agreed that the monitoring process for participating donors should involve an agreed multiyear P A F matrix
o f policy and institutional reforms, w i t h results-focused monitoring indicators and progress benchmarks, for
which the Government i s prepared to be held to account and against which donors would agree to provide
budget support in more predictable ways.
The P A F matrix, as agreed in September 2003, includes specific indicators and benchmarks for
development progress for 2004 and more indicative indicators and benchmarks for subsequent years. I t i s
expected to be updated twice a year, through a two-stage consultative process led by the Government. The
first stage will involve sector-specific working groups that would identify key sectoral indicators, and the
second stage a coordinating workmg group, chaired by the MPF, that will combine sector-specific indicators
into a single matrix which clearly indicates overall priorities for the matrix period. Given Mozambique’s
financial year and the M P F obligation to report o n the previous year’s outturn by February 15, parties
agreed that the m a i n (backward-looking) annual assessment should occur in Februarymarch. At the same
time, given the M P F obligation to send the annual budget and PES to Parliament by September 30, it was
agreed that the main (forward-looking) annual agreement o n an updated P A F matrix should occur in
AugustJSeptember.
The P A F work operationalizes a growing consensus among development partners around several aid
modalities (see the Rome and Monterrey consensus and the Bank’s Strategic Framework for IDA’s
Assistance in Africa, which stress the mutual responsibilities o f developing and developed countries for
reaching development goals): (i)
P A F donors are committed to providing assistance in ways that are better
aligned w i t h Mozambique’s own development priorities; (ii)
provided that Mozambique builds a good track
record, P A F donors expect to make aid flows more predictable and long-term; and (iii)
PAF donors agree
that predictability w i l l increasingly imply conditionality derived more directly f r o m the PARPA.

- 22 -

CAS Results Framework
42.
The C A S results framework (see Table 7 and Annex 1) indicates the outcomes
that the Bank expects to help the Government to achieve over the C A S period. These
results were chosen in light o f the MDGs, the priority indicators included in the
Government’s PAF matrix,13 the IDA triggers, and the H I P C expenditure-tracking
indicators, taking into account: Mozambique’s development priorities; Government
ownership, capacity and commitment to act; Bank projects under implementation and
their agreed performance indicators; and the Bank’s o w n track record and comparative
advantage vis-a-vis the other partners. Given expected delays between project
preparation, implementation, and achievement o f results, most outcomes during the CAS
period are expected to result from implementation o f the ongoing portfolio.
43.
The Bank Group i s ideally suited to helping to improve the investment climate, as
the Group can provide full-service policy advice as w e l l as complementary instruments to
support k e y private-sector developments. K e y impediments to business that require
policy and institutional reform and that the Bank Group can support through i t s country
dialogue and the PRSCs include: (i)
reducing the time and cost incurred in registering a
increasing flexibility in the labor market; (iii)
streamlining the land
new business; (ii)
allocation process; (iv) speeding Government payment o f foreign exchange and valueadded-tax (VAT) refunds; and (v) improving customs clearance times.

44.
Project support will also help to improve the investment climate. The Southern
Africa Regional Gas Project illustrates these complementarities, as i t involves an IFC
equity participation, MIGA guarantee and IBRD partial risk guarantee. In addition, the
Bank Group will support several large risky developments, either because they have
demonstrative effect (such as NWDP2, which supports private sector management o f
urban water supply) or because they are expected to have a catalytic impact on growth
(such as the Roads and Bridges 2, which will finance rural roads as w e l l as the Caia
bridge over the Zambezi, and the Beira Railway project, which will open the Zambezi
valley and promote regional integration by rehabilitating the Sena and Machipanda
railway lines and encouraging development o f the Moatize coal mine). On a smaller
scale, I F C i s working to promote SMEs-Mozambique i s an S M E focal country for
IFC-and IDA i s preparing a Sustainable Rural Development project in cooperation with
IFC and MIGA.14 In a complementary fashion, the Bank Group will continue to expand
basic infrastructure, both through public investment in the roads sector and through
increasing private participation in telecommunications, ports, railways, air transportation,
l3
O f 63 priority actions and indicators in the P A F matrix as identified by the Government in late
September 2003,48 (or 76%) are included in the C A S Results Framework.
l4IDA’Scomparative advantage in promoting growth lies in i t s ability to undertake analytical work that i s
informed by global experience in developing countries, allowing it to provide relevant technical and policy
advice, combined with lending where grant financing i s unavailable. IFC’s advantages include i t s ability to
foster sustainable private sector development by providing loan and equity financing for private-sector
projects located in the developing world; helping private companies in the developing world mobilize
financing in intemational markets; and providing advice and technical assistance to businesses and
governments. MIGA complements the work o f the IDA and the I F C by advising host countries o n
attraction o f FDI and by providing political risk insurance coverage for foreign private investors.

The Bank Group will also help the Government to improve service delivery. The
45.
PRSCs will help by supporting institutional reform that results in improved business
services and better health and education services for the poor, while investment projects
will help to achieve human development outcomes more directly. Education will b e the
primary focus, with IDA support continuing for the ongoing Education and Higher
Education projects as w e l l as a proposed Technical and Vocational Education project.
IDA i s the largest financier o f c i v i l works in education and the o n l y donor providing
comprehensive sector coverage; i t s expertise i s widely recognized so its departure would
leave a large gap. In addition, the secondary impacts o f education (in empowering
individuals to improve their skills, health and nutritional status and in enabling f i r m s to

- 25

adapt new technologies that increase capacity and competitiveness) are so great that
concentration o n this sector i s highly appropriate.

46.
Improving governance as w e l l as building public-sector capacity are also a Bank
focus. The PRSCs will help to strengthen the fiduciary framework and the financial
sector and implement public sector reform. Since m u c h o f the PRSC agenda grows out
o f Bank analytical work, the Bank i s better positioned to support this agenda than other
donors. The PRSC also provides IDA with a vehicle to respond to Government and G11
requests to help coordinate donor budget support around a single calendar and a single set
o f monitoring instruments. M o r e direct assistance to this agenda will b e provided
through complementary IDA investment projects, including the Public Sector Reform
project, which aims to begin a process o f restructuring government for improved service
delivery, as well as the Municipal Development and Decentralized Planning and Finance
projects, where the Bank i s helping the Government to scale-up and harmonize multiple
donor-supported decentralization projects around common modalities. At the same time,
most IDA infrastructure projects are building the regulatory and management capacities
o f the k e y institutions in the sectors that they support. Responding to evident needs, at
the request o f Government and donors alike, the Bank will also support capacity-building
in the financial sector, the legal and judicial sector, and possibly M&E.

THE CAS PILLARS
The Bank Group’s program for FY04-07 i s built around a results framework that
47.
improving the
itself builds o n the PARPA’s priorities. The CAS has three pillars: (i)
expanding service delivery, both to businesses and to the poor,
investment climate, (ii)
building public-sector capacity and accountability structures (see Table 9).
and (iii)

Pillar 1: Improving the Investment Climate
48.
Objectives, outcomes and benchmarks: Bank activities under this pillar aim to
help the Government to sustain GDP growth per capita and reduce income poverty
through improving the investment climate and facilitating public-private partnerships in
infrastructure. Bank performance under this pillar will b e judged against progress made
in: lowering the cost and time associated with registering a business; obtaining greater
flexibility in the labor law; lowering customs clearance times; ensuring banking-sector
compliance with international accounting standards (IAS); increasing transparency in
public procurement; doubling telephone density; maintaining an expanding length o f
primary and secondary roads; increasing international traffic o n Mozambique’s railway
and port systems; and finally introducing a strategic private partner into EdM, extending
the grid, and reducing connection costs and power losses. Firms in Mozambique
identified many issues related to these results as serious business constraints (see B o x 8).
The Bank Group will make use o f policy dialogue, financing programs, and partnerships
to help achieve these objectives.
Newfiizancing: Building o n recent progress, the first PRSC series will help t o
49.
ease constraints to business; strengthen the overall fiduciary framework; reform the
financial sector by modernizing supervision capacity and ensuring that all banks comply

with U S ; and implement public sector reform aiming to tackle corruption, improve
service delivery, and reduce bureaucratic inefficiencies. A s the Government and the
Bank gain experience with the PRSC and the overall fiduciary framework i s
strengthened, and without overloading the instrument with conditionality, the PRSC will
b e gradually expanded to incorporate support for sectoral activities, playing a
complementary role to IDA’Scapacity-building efforts (see Pillar 3) and enabling other
donors to invest in those sectors without heavy conditionality. Agriculture will be one o f
the first “stacked” sectors: when IDA closes i t s current PROAGRI credit in June 2004,
further IDA support will consist in policy dialogue and analytical w o r k provided to
MADER through the Bank’s PRSC missions, with financing provided through the PRSC
itself, and therefore through the MPF than through a dedicated investment project
controlled by MADER; in this way, the multi-year transition in the agriculture sector
from discrete IDA investment projects towards programmatic support will be completed.
Future support for health, basic education, and rural water supply and sanitation will also
be incorporated into the PRSC’s programmatic approach as core fiduciary w o r k i s
completed and project support in these sectors comes to a close.

50.
The share o f the PRSCs in IDA financing over the C A S period would grow from
35% to 50% o f average annual lending, provided that the Government makes adequate
progress in improving public expenditure management (as indicated by progress against
the H P C expenditure tracking indicators, which will b e incorporated into PRSC
conditionality as appropriate).

Several new infrastructure projects will also be proposed under this pillar. First,
IDA’S$60 million Beira Railway project will support the rehabilitation o f the Sena and
Machipanda railway lines through concessioning the system to a private operator that
bids for the least public subsidy, and an IDA guarantee to complement public funding
and leverage private financing will also be considered, o n the Government’s request.
Rehabilitation of the lines, expected initially to carry one m i l l i o n tons o f freight annually,
will improve transportation l i n k s with Malawi and Zimbabwe and help to unlock
development in the Zambezi river valley, where the majority o f Mozambicans live. In
particular, rehabilitation o f the Sena line i s expected to encourage the exploitation o f coal
at Moatize. Second, building o n the Gas Engineering credit, the Bank Group through the
Southern Africa Regional Gas project will help finance infrastructure for processing and
transporting natural gas from the Temane and Pande gas fields for sale in Mozambique
and South Africa, thereby stimulating growth o f related industrial and commercial
activities. Bank Group support will involve three Bank entities: in December 2002
MIGA provided an equity guarantee for the project, which will be rolled over to a debt
guarantee; IBRD, in documents before the Board today, i s proposing a $30 million Partial
Risk Guarantee; and IFC expects to provide equity support for the upstream component
o f the project. Third, the second phase o f the Roads and Bridges project (APL)i s
expected to begin in FY07; building on the first phase, which will have connected all

Box 8: Selected reforms for improving the investment climate
Over the C A S period, the Bank w i l l focus attention o n several policy and institutional reforms that
recent studies show to be critical to improving Mozambique’s investment climate.
The C A S results framework includes three specific targets to be achieved over the CAS period. The
first involves bringing down to international norms the cost (now 108% o f GNI per capita) and time
(now 174 days) o f registering a business, by eliminating procedures and lowering Government response
times (for example, commercial registration n o w takes about 30 days, compared to a few hours in many
other countries). This can be done by computerizing the registration process; integrating the operations
o f the three institutions involved in this process; and outsourcing some functions to the private sector.
The second target involves obtaining a more flexible labor market, by changing the labor law to
permit remuneration through piece rates, simpler and cheaper foreign hires (it n o w takes a firm about
90 days and $400 to obtain a permit); and lower severance payments (retrenched employees currently
receive up to three months pay for every two years worked). This will help to raise skills-transfer levels
and shift the balance away from capital-intensive and towards labor-intensive enterprises.
The third target involves lowering customs clearance times (from a national average o f 12 days for
imports and 17 days for exports), with a focus o n the center and the north o f the country, where times
are greater still, and o n ground shipments from South Africa border; this will help f i r m s to obtain
critical inputs in a timely manner, meet strict delivery deadlines, compete better in export markets, and
tie-up fewer resources in inventories.
Although not explicitly included in the results framework, the Bank will also seek to improve the
investment climate by helping the Government to undertake other reforms. These reforms will a i m to:
(i)
ensure timely Government payment o f VAT refunds, investment incentives, and other promised
services, so that current investors experience less cash-flow strain and potential investors are more
confident that promised Government actions will occur; (ii)
decrease the number o f Government
inspections (health, labor, etc.) per annum, particularly in the center o f the country, where they now
average six in number (with local officials responsible for the higher administrative costs incurred); and
(iii)
improve the land allocation process, chiefly by streamlining the document collection process so
that MADER achievement o f finalizing within 90 days o f submission o f completed documents i s
meaningful. All six o f the outcomes described here would help businesses to compete better.
~

provincial capitals to the trunk road network, the second phase will have a stronger rural
focus o n secondary and tertiary roads and will also help finance the Caia bridge over the
Zambezi, thereby literally helping to bridge the divide between south and north. Fourth,
Mozambique i s one o f five countries participating in the Southern Africa Power Pool
(SAPP) project, which aims to facilitate development o f an efficient SADC power market
that will reduce electricity prices, foster regional integration, increase competitiveness,
and create the conditions for accelerated investment. The Mozambique component,
which IDA would finance with a credit o f up to $48 million ( o f which $13 million will be
drawn from the Mozambique allocation), will support the construction o f a 220 kV
transmission line from Mozambique to Malawi.

52.
In addition, IDA i s preparing a Sustainable Rural Development project, which
will build on PROAGRI 1 and the Transfrontier Conservation Areas project. This may
involve promoting conservation tourism o f Mozambique’s unique inland and coastal
natural resources through public and private investment, facilitated by IDA, I F C and
MIGA, in high-quality tourism infrastructure. This would involve strengthening
oversight institutions; implementing required policy and institutional reform, particularly
regarding concessioning and conservation-area management; developing mechanisms for
community participation; and establishing basic infrastructure such as roads and park
facilities for core protected areas, with appropriate linkages to communities and the

- 29 -

private sector. Given Mozambique’s relatively unspoiled natural habitats and proximity
to South A h c a , a major tourist hub, the potential for growth in tourism i s high.
53.
New AAA: The PRSC will be based o n strong joint AAA, including the 2002
Investment Climate survey, a financial sector assessment, and a legal and judicial reform
assessment; a C E M (completed in 2001) as w e l l as a CPAR, a CFAA, and t w o PERs (all
recently completed); and the IFPRI/Government Poverty Assessment, which will b e
completed by December 2003 (before the first PRSC operation i s finalized). In addition,
the Bank will complete new AAA to help the Government to prepare an integrated rural
development strategy; to determine the poverty and social impact o f agricultural policy;
and to deepen understanding o f Mozambique’s private-sector competitiveness (aiming
inter alia to quantify the economic costs o f administrative impediments to investment and
to analyze the causes of l o w factor productivity). Support will also b e provided to help
the Government to implement the recently-approved national framework for sustainable
tourism and environmental management. T o keep due-diligence AAA up-to-date, a new
CEM, focusing o n natural resource management and its contribution to growth, will b e
prepared to inform discussions with the new Government that i s elected in late 2004.
Following completion o f the Poverty Assessment in FY04 and the population census in
FY06, further poverty w o r k m a y be undertaken to fill in gaps, for example, regarding
poverty monitoring or the links between Mozambique’s recent growth performance and
incomes, consumption and rural vulnerability. An infrastructure assessment will also b e
completed to take stock o f achievements, identify remaining work to b e done, and
establish a plan o f action. In addition, IDA and I F C will continue to help agricultural
firms with export potential to gain access to export markets through adopting modern
farming techniques and ensuring high-quality handling along the entire supply chain.
Ongoing activities: In the meantime, Bank Group support to improving the
54.
investment climate will continue through the current portfolio. Responding to private
sector complaints about the quality o f infrastructure services in Mozambique (see Figure
5), the portfolio for several years has been oriented to improving infrastructure service
delivery by increasing private-sector participation and competition in infrastructure.
While there has already been substantial success, further work i s needed. In particular:

I D A ’ s ongoing Energy Reform project will introduce private participation into EdM
with a view to improving its efficiency (the average client currently experiences 17
power outages a month) as w e l l as its financial viability.
I D A ’ s Communications Reform project, following the sale o f a second cellular
telephone license in 2002 (to Vodacom), will support the privatizations o f TdM, m C e l
(formerly part o f TdM, but n o w an independent corporate entity), and LAM, as w e l l
as the concessioning o f the Maputo and Nacala airports.
T o ensure future expansion o f urban water supply and consolidation o f gains in
reliability and sustainability, NWDP2, which supports the introduction o f private
operators for the water supply systems in Mozambique’s five largest cities, will b e
extended and supplemented (with a $15 m i l l i o n credit) to cover costs incurred by the
need to rebid the concessions following the withdrawal o f the original operator.
I F C i s helping to privatize Petromoc, the state-owned petroleum distributor.

Box 9: IFC and MIGA in Mozambique
International Financial Corporation: IFC’s portfolio o f $154 m i l l i o n consists o f 14 projects in
agribusiness, hotels, banking and manufacturing. Six o f these projects are in the small- and
medium-sized enterprise sector. IFC’s $120 million investment in M o z a l 1 was its largest at that
time (IFC also invested $25 m i l l i o n in Mozal2) and a proposed equity investment in the Sasol gas
pipeline project i s before the Board today.
IFC’s new Strategic Initiative for Africa, which i s n o w being finalized, w i l l a i m to capitalize
o n IFC’s role as a catalyst and agent o f change and enhance its ability to be a strong partner for the
private sector. I F C will be more focused and proactive in engaging both the private sector and
governments to help build an attractive investment climate in which I F C and other partners will be
able to support more and better investments to achieve the maximum development impact.
The three main pillars o f the strategy are expected to be: (i)
enhanced support to SMEs in the
proactive project development, and (iii)
engagement o n improving the investment
region, (ii)
climate. Within this context the IFC’s strategy for Mozambique i s likely to focus on:
Tourism and the private sector: This involves a joint strategy o f the Bank Group and the
Ministry o f Tourism, building o n Bank analytical work, to help develop a tourism and
conservation area linking Mozambique w i t h Malawi, South Africa, Swaziland, and Zimbabwe.
IFC’s role i s to ensure that this initiative i s bankable in terms o f private sector perspectives.

MSMEs: Mozambique has been included in a list o f eight African pilot countries for a new
joint I D A - I F C initiative for M S M E development. The proposed M S M E Program aims to
reduce constraints to growth and competitiveness by: (i)
increasing access to finance; (ii)
opening access to new markets by building the technical capacities o f businesses located in
Mozambique; and (iii)
improving the enabling environment for private sector participation by
reducing red tape.
Private Sector Advisory Services: I F C i s supporting the privatization o f Petromoc (the stateowned petroleum distributor) and has also offered to provide assistance to the G o M to markettest the existing design for the Sena railway concession and review strategic options for the
fiture development o f the Moatize coal mine and associated infrastructure developments.

Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency: MIGA promotes development by helping emerging
economies attract private foreign investment by offering political risk insurance to investors and
lenders and advisory services to investment promotion intermediaries. MIGA also acts as an
intermediary to help resolve disputes between developing countries and investors.
T o date, MIGA has facilitated foreign direct investment (FDI) o f approximately US$1.5
billion into Mozambique through i t s guarantees program, supporting the M o z a l aluminum project;
the rehabilitation and partial privatization o f the Marromeu sugar estate; the development o f the
Maputo port; Motraco’s construction and operation o f an electricity transmission project to
interconnect South Africa, Swaziland and Mozambique; and the renovation o f a Maputo hotel.
MIGA’s guarantees help reduce noncommercial risks associated with FDI, offering protection
against currency inconvertibility and transfer restrictions, war and c i v i l disturbance (including
terrorism), expropriation, and breach o f contract.
MIGA’s technical assistance helps formulate and implement strategies for attracting FDI, by
providing advice and tailored assistance to public and private organizations in image-building,
sector targeting, and outreach and information dissemination. Through online information services,
MIGA connects investors to current information o n investment opportunities, business operating
conditions, potential partners, and other resources. Under the PoDE project, MIGA provides
advice and assistance to C P I to advance the development o f the Beluluane Free Zone, which i s
designed to attract export manufacturers and suppliers o f goods and services to M o z a l and also
features an industrial park where local businesses are encouraged to locate. In addition, MIGA i s
working with C P I to attract FDI to serve global markets; this program, sponsored in part by the
Swiss, supports the non-traditional export industry, an area that holds considerable potential.
MIGA w i l l be exploring new areas o f potential synergy and cooperation with other Bank
agencies during C A S implementation and will continue to profile investment opportunities in
Mozambique through i t s online investment services, namely PrivatizationLink and FDI Xchange.

Through the Railways and Ports project, IDA will continue to support concessioning
o f the Maputo and Nacala port and railway systems.

Mozambique, like many other countries, experienced declining private-sector

interest and investment in infrastructure in the 1 9 9 0 though
~~
i t s infrastructure needs
remain enormous. The Bank Group i s uniquely able to offer an array o f complementary
skills and products to help leverage resources, from anywhere along the public-private
continuum, to support further development, with IDA supporting upstream work on
sector policy, strategy and design o f the privatization transactions; IFC providing
necessary financing to the investors; and MIGA profiling potential investment
opportunities and providing political risk coverage, as needed. Cost recovery will be key
to long-term success, but it will proceed at a realistic pace, and targeted subsidies may be
used to establish connections and temporarily to support user charges.15 Over time,
increased private-sector participation in infrastructure will enable private providers, who
typically have the resources and management skills required to offer services more
efficiently than Government, to improve quality and lower costs, while enabling the
Government to save capacity and concentrate o n matters which only Government can
handle, including especially policy and regulatory matters (see Pillar 3).
56.
The Bank i s also supporting the development o f SMEs more generally.
Following a mid-term review, the Enterprise Development project i s being restructured to
provide greater private-sector access to equity and credit (including expanding the
availability o f microfinance and the utilization o f existing equity funds); to strengthen
linkages between large-scale projects and SMEs; and to provide technical assistance to
M I C , MITUR, the Chamber o f Commerce, and C P I (which receives complementary
assistance from IDA and MIGA), aiming to help them better to understand the products
and sectors where Mozambique i s competitive and to develop the capacity to promote
them. In addition, the Mineral Resources Management project i s promoting mining in
Mozambique (111 exploration licenses and 16 mining licenses have been issued),
particularly among artisanal miners.

Pillar 2: Expanding service delivery

57.
Objectives, outcomes and benchmarks: The second C A S pillar focuses o n the
human development MDGs, which are k e y to improving quality o f l i f e as w e l l as labor
productivity and therefore growth. In this area, the Government aims to control HIV
prevalence, reduce child mortality, raise access to safe water, raise the primary education
completion rate, and increase Mozambican participation in business management and
achieving less risky
professions. The Bank Group's specific contribution involves: (i)
sexual behavior, especially among high-risk groups, by raising condom use and delaying
l5To ensure that service delivery remains affordable to people with l o w incomes or in areas o f l o w
population density where market-based solutions to service delivery are adopted, transparent finding
mechanisms w i l l be designed to improve their affordability and accessibility, including output-based-aid.
A Government subsidy provided o n output-based terms differs f r o m a traditional public subsidy in linking
the subsidy to achieving a specific output, such as the number o f consumers connected to electrical services
per year, rather than directing it at an input such as the building o f infrastructure to deliver the service.

a youth’s first sexual encounter; (ii)
helping to achieve more reliable and sustainable
high-quality water supply in rural areas and in the five principal cities, thereby also
helping to improve health outcomes; (iii)
improving EP1 and EP2 planning, management,
and budget execution and also supporting gender parity initiatives and teacher
development, so that recent improvements in primary school access are matched with
improvements in quality; and (iv) supporting vocational, technical, and university
education to increase the skills o f high-level workers. The Bank also aims to improve
service delivery in health, education and agriculture by building the capacity to manage
decentralized service delivery and motivating and retaining c i v i l servants by providing
improved incentives.

58.
Newfirtancing: Several o f the PRSC’s core activities are explicitly intended to
modernizing budget formulation systems;
improve service delivery. These include: (i)
(ii)
improving budget execution and reporting through the introduction o f SISTAFE; (iii)
expanding fiscal decentralization; (iv) strengthening intemal and extemal audit, including
by promoting institutional independence and supporting the accounting and auditing
professions (which are extremely underrepresented in Mozambique); and (v) completing
essential reforms in the public procurement system. In addition, later operations under
the PRSC are expected to include support to policy and institutional reform in the health
and education sectors, with a view to promoting efficiency, transparency and
accountability in service delivery.

59.

Several investment projects are also planned. Recognizing that a shortage o f
skilled Mozambican workers continues to constrain growth and limit the distribution o f
its benefits in Mozambique, a new $20 m i l l i o n Technical and Vocational Education
project will be prepared to address the missing middle in Mozambique’s education and
leaming program. The project will aim to increase the graduation o f Mozambicans with
the skills, practices, and attitudes needed to fill technical positions, and create valueadding knowledge and innovation in production. The project will be developed through a
strategic partnership among Government, academic institutions, and the private sector,
and will also aim to improve gender equity. In this context, IFC m a y support private
education at the tertiary level, and i t has an initial project under development for a
technical college. Mozambique m a y also b e one o f four pilot countries in Africa
participating in an IDA-financed A I D S Treatment Acceleration Program (TAP); this
regional project i s expected to provide additional funding to international NGOs that are
already active in A I D S treatment activities in order to help identify effective treatment
models that can b e affordably and sustainably scaled-up in the African context.

60.
New R4A: T o help identify the education project, IDA will complete a study o f
the linkages between labor markets and technical and vocational education, to determine
what the market needs, h o w w e l l existing institutions satisfy those needs, what gaps
remain, h o w those gaps can best b e filled, and what other opportunities exist for
improving efficiencies. A country status report o n health i s already underway, and i t will
help to inform health policy dialogue in the context o f the PRSC and other donor
harmonization discussions. An H I V / A I D S retrospective will be completed in FY06 to

Box 10: Common funding mechanisms: from SWAps to budget support
Mozambique and i t s external partners have many years o f experience with financial pooling
arrangements. Agriculture, education and health continue to be the focal sectors.
Pooling in support o f the PROAGFU i s the most advanced-1 8 donors, include IDA,
contribute. Financial management has several basic features: (i)
an annual budget and activity
plan (PAAO) that provides both an annual work plan (agreed between MADER and supporting
donors) and budget information to the MPF; (ii)
quarterly transfers o f merged donor funds to the
Treasury account for PROAGRI; and (iii)
MADER provision o f quarterly financial reports
regarding both budget appropriations and activities before any new activities are discussed. A
number o f bodies monitor progress, including a GoM-donor working group; an internal financial
management committee; and an overall annual review group that meets biennially to discuss
annual work plans, budgets and audits. PROAGRI represents a compromise between pure forms o f
off-budget and on-budget donor support, as donor funding i s integrated into the GoM’s planning
process, included in the budget, channeled through G o M accounts, and presented for parliamentary
approval, but i t i s also earmarked for P R O A G R I and thus protected when the Treasury comes
under pressure during budget execution.
The education sector moved closer to the PROAGRI model in January 2003, when six donors
began to fund the sector through a common funding mechanism that uses IDA procurement and
financial management procedures (because the existing IDA credit was already fully committed in
January, IDA does not yet contribute). Other sectors can move in the same direction, by
formulating a sector-wide prioritized work program, covering a l l sectoral resources; moving pooled
funds through a single Treasury account (thus encouraging M P F and the relevant sectoral ministry
to work together); as well as reporting and auditing o n the PROAGRI model. In health, pooling
arrangements are already being used by seven donors to support drug purchases (about $15-20
m i l l i o n per annum since 1997) and by three donors to support recurrent expenditures (about $3
m i l l i o n in 2002); these would continue to operate in the interim but can be merged into the m a i n
p o o l once it i s established.
SWAps involve taking a graduated approach to greater use o f Government budget systems.
They can help to improve sectoral planning, enhance transparency in budgetary allocations against
identified priorities, and reinforce incentives to strengthen public financial management-but only
if most donors agree to j o i n the pools and stick with them for a considerable period (say five
years), thereby ensuring the Ministry incentives are all aligned. They can improve absorptive
capacity by eliminating the Government need to respond to multiple cumbersome donor
administrative mechanisms. They also protect sectoral spending allocations, thus giving sectors
greater budget certainty. But the advantages are incomplete as long as sectoral “silos” are
maintained: in particular, sector-level systems (e.g. o f procurement and financial management)
may be strengthened independently o f central systems and o f each other, at the expense o f possible
intersystemic incompatibilities and MPF’s ability to coordinate; in addition MPF’s ability to
respond to external shocks will focus disproportionately o n unprotected sectors. After several
years o f increasingly good experience in the SWAps, it i s clear that ringfencing public expenditure
systems in selected sectors cannot be the end point o f the trend towards using government systems
for the f l o w o f donor financing.

initiated under NWDP 1, will continue, in order to analyze and evaluate the vulnerability
o f the national economy to water resource-related shocks and climatic variability (both
floods and droughts) with a view to mitigating them and delinking the economy from
variability. Given that Mozambique i s the down-stream riparian country in several
international river basins including the Limpopo and the Zambezi, this exercise will
include the issue o f international waters management and an analysis o f the impacts on
the Mozambican economy o f the management decisions o f neighbouring countries.

Although the Bank does not have a project that focuses directly o n addressing gender inequality in
Mozambique, many projects incorporate activities w i t h this aim.
PROAGRI has targeted making 25% o f extension workers female (about 15% are now); agriculture
research institutions have incorporated gender sensitivity into on-farm trials evaluation criteria; and a l l
agricultural statistics are expected to be disaggregated by gender over time. The Health Sector Recovery
project supported the construction o f rural health clinics, which are the principal source o f maternal and
chdd health care in Mozambique, and maternal and child health were explicitly monitored during project
implementation; the project also supported the training o f maternal and child health nurses under i t s $14
m i l l i o n Human Resource Development component. The Education project supports adult literacy
programs that enroll mostly women as well as water and sanitation improvements that disproportionately
impact girls’ enrolment and retention, and the Higher Education project requires each public university to
establish a target for female enrolment and the provincial scholarship scheme has a preference for
supporting qualified female high school graduates. In addition, the Roads projects, through ANE’s
Social Unit, has developed a three-year plan to maximize the employment o f women in the road sector,
enhance their technical slulls, and promote female participation in ANE; from zero female road workers
several years ago, there are n o w over 5,500 in a workforce o f about 35,300, or about 16%, while female
employment within ANE has risen to 47 o f 22 1, or 2 1%.
Even projects where gender issues are not obvious take gender into account in their preparation and
implementation: for example, in developing a rural telecommunications and access strategy, the
experiences o f women entrepreneurs operating public telephones or Internet centers in rural areas (such as
the “Grameen Phone” experience) are being explored for potential replication; in addition female use
patterns will be explicitly monitored. While there i s s t i l l a long way to go to achieve gender equality in
Mozambiaue. mogress i s being made. with assistance f r o m the Bank and other donors.

61.
Ongoing activities: The education sector i s already receiving substantial IDA
assistance through the basic Education and Higher Education projects, which aim to
strengthen the entire system by improving access and completion rates (especially for
females) as w e l l as the quality and relevance o f student learning. The PRSCs will support
some o f the policy and institutional reforms required to achieve these goals and the PERs
will support analytical w o r k to determine the sector-specific and socio-economic reasons
underlying l o w completion rates. IDA’SHealth project recently closed, but financial and
analytical support to the sector will continue. Critical policy issues (budget execution,
decentralization, and c i v i l service reform) will be discussed and response measures
proposed through the country status report (FY04), with support for these measures to be
provided through the PRSC; the report will also review the new policy directions and the
reasons for the apparently poor response o f health outcomes to inputs, including
especially the user fee arrangements and the 2001 beneficiary assessment.
62.
T o improve health outcomes, substantial Bank supervisory resources will be
deployed to ensure a rapid and sustained start to the H I V / A I D S project. In addition, I D A
through NWDP 1 and 2 will continue to support the policy and institutional reforms
needed to improve public expenditure in rural and urban water supply to meet the
PARPA targets for 2005 and the longer-term water MDG; both projects will be extended
pending a transferal, in the case o f rural water, o f support to the PRSC.
Pillar 3: Building capacity and accountability

63.
Objectives, outcomes and benchmarks: Under Pillar 3, the Bank aims to help the
Government to improve public expenditure management and contain corruption. Progress
will be demonstrated by progressively meeting more benchmarks among the 15 H I P C

- 35 -

poverty-related expenditure tracking indicators (of which five are already met), with the
focus initially o n improving budget comprehensiveness, classification and reporting (see
Table lo), The Bank will also aim to strengthen the rule o f law, including systems
supporting contract enforcement, and to enhance the Government’s M&E capacity.

Newfinancing M o s t o f the PRSC’s core activities will help to build capacity
and improve expenditure accountability, including the capacity to formulate, execute and
report the budget; strengthen linkages between outcomes, activities, and resource
transfers; enhance internal and external audit; and professionalize public procurement.
Complementary investment projects will include the second phase o f the Public Sector
Reform APL (FY07); a Legal Sector Capacity Building project which will support legal
training, court system reform, and M o J reorganization in a manner complementary to the

- 36 -

DANIDA democracy program;I6 as w e l l as a Financial Sector Capacity Building project
aiming to improve the soundness, efficiency, reach and depth o f the financial system,
thereby helping entrepreneurs to acquire the capital they need to finance new or
expanding businesses. These small capacity-building projects respond to the concerns o f
Government and donors as w e l l as the joint IDA-IMF Financial Sector Assessment
completed in mid-2003, and they constitute a key response to the banking sector troubles.
In addition, they will help the Government to improve its C P I A rating for the financial
sector (one o f two indicators where Mozambique scores below the regional average).
65.
New AAA: The Bank will also complete new AAA under this pillar. A Legal and
Judicial Assessment, CPAR and PER are complete or nearing completion, and in addition
expenditure-tracking exercises are planned or underway in the roads, water, health,
education, and agriculture sectors, in close coordination with other donors involved in
developing o r supporting SWAPS in these sectors. After the PRSC i s initiated, IDA will
begin to undertake annual PERs to determine trends and issues made evident by the
budget outtums, and to help devise appropriate responses. An Institutional Governance
Review (FY05) will help identify administrative barriers to frontline service delivery and
will also publish the results o f a series o f planned national corruption surveys (the .
baseline survey will soon begin), with action plans to b e supported by several IDA
projects. In FY07, the poverty and social impact o f pay reform will also b e assessed.
Ongoing activities: The PARPA has begun a process o f enabling participation o f
66.
the poor in government planning; improving policy coordination and M&E; increasing
accountability for public expenditures; improving civil-servant pay and skill levels (now
very poor even by African standards); decentralizing service delivery to local authorities;
and addressing corruption. The Bank’s portfolio i s helping to deepen this process. At the
central level, the Public Sector Reform project17 i s initiating a process o f restructuring
government for improved service delivery by: improving expenditure management and
accounting systems; reengineering service-delivery systems to be more effective; and
training staff to operate these systems and manage change.” In parallel, the Municipal
Development and the Decentralized Planning project (the latter before the Board with this
CAS) will develop the capacity o f local authorities to identify, appraise and implement
small-scale infrastructure projects using grant resources to “learn by doing”. M o r e
particularly, the Decentralized Planning project will scale-up a Dutch/ U N C D F pilot to as
many as 49 districts in the four central provinces o f Manica, Sofala, Tete, and Zambezia,
with a view, over time, t o harmonizing the competing systems that donors n o w deploy.
In addition, the ongoing Education, Higher Education, and PROAGRI projects are all
continuing to build capacity to deliver services o n the front-line.

first phase o f this APL was approved in FY03 and the second phase i s expected to begin in FY07.
In addition, PSR i s supporting the achievement o f several “quick wins” that are important to business
development: three have been achieved to date (reducing land registration time f r o m three years to 90 days
(once all documentation i s in place); developing a “one-stop shop” for business registration in Maputo; and
issuing visas at the border) and three others are expected next year (simplifyingpublic sector recruitment;
improving the pensions payments process; and simplifying hospital administrative processes).
” The

- 37 -

67.
IDA will also continue to build Government capacity to address the numerous
regulatory issues that private participation in infrastructure entails. Traditionally, the
close relationship between Government departments and state-owned enterprises has
meant that policy-making, regulation and operations have been embodied in a single
institutional process, but to enable private participation to succeed, these functions have
to be unbundled before privatization occurs, by designing and implementing regulations
and competition policies; establishing, strengthening and harmonizing the regulatory and
supervisory bodies; and training regulatory staff. The Bank has been supporting this
effort in the water, roads, railways, telecommunications, electricity and air transportation
sectors (for example, IDA has helped to establish and staff the National Road Authority,
the Road Fund, and CFM’s Commercial and Safety Inspection Unit; to restructure the
Ministry o f Transport and upgrade staff skills; to provide technical assistance to DNA on
negotiating international river rights and completing a flood risk analysis; and to provide
support to the water investment management company (FIPAG) and regulator (CRA).

This CAS i s consistent with the PARPA priorities and with the Government’s
68.
priority actions for 2003-2006: o f 63 priority PAF actions and indicators, as identifiedby
the Government in late September 2003,48 (or 76%) are included in the CAS results
framework. Hence, Government commitment i s high. Yet a number o f institutional
weaknesses may impede implementation, including deficient rules; weak linkages
between M&E, planning and budgeting, both within ministries and between sectoral
ministries and the MPF; and a weak intergovernmental transfer system that will constitute
an obstacle to decentralization. In addition, public sector capacity remains a large
constraint: government officials have limited education; remuneration i s not competitive
with the private sector except at very senior levels; and consequently most ministries are
run by a few capable people who need to do everything. A culture o f service and
accountability i s also just beginning to be established in Mozambique, so government
responsiveness to citizen requests remains poor. Finally, corruption i s a growing
concem, which requires an aggressive response (see page 12, B o x 4).

All o f these concems have impacted design o f the CAS. The PRSCs will
69.
frontally and systematically address many systemic and institutional weaknesses; the
emphasis o n private sector participation in infrastructure i s intended to help save limited
public-sector capacity; most sector investment projects include capacity-building
activities; and the program overall includes several projects that explicitly support
capacity-building in the key areas o f public sector reform, decentralization, and improved
public financial management.
Lending Scenarios
70.
IDA allocation and use of grant resources: In the base case, financing over the
CAS period would total about $560 m i l l i o n over four years. Credit and grant amounts in
Table 9 are nominal; final amounts will be adjusted according to Mozambique’s actual
allocation, i t s absorptive capacity, the availability o f grant funds from other donors, and
the pace o f reforms. Mozambique received part o f i t s IDA allocation in the form o f
grants during FY03-04 and this was h l l y allocated to the HIV/AIDS, Public Sector

- 38 -

Reform, and Decentralized Planning and Finance projects, given their direct impact o n
pro-poor service delivery.

The base case scenario: In the base case, real GDP growth i s expected to grow at
71.
7% per annum, or about the average growth experienced since 1987. Growth will be
driven by a substantial rise in investment (primarily foreign). Exports o f goods and
services, excluding large projects, are expected to grow around 8% percent per annum o n
average (1 1% including large projects), and the NPV o f debt-to-export ratio i s projected
to fall gradually to less than 50% by 2020, w e l l below the 150% sustainability target.
72.
In FY04, Bank activities would focus o n effectively launching the Public Sector
Reform, H I V / A I D S and Decentralized Planning projects, to initiate central government
restructuring, selected decentralization, and k e y HIV prevention activities. I t would also
focus o n expanding IDA support for public-private participation in infrastructure in close
cooperation with I F C and MIGA; disseminating analytical work o n the investment
climate and legal and judicial reform; and agreeing with the Government and other
partners o n the k e y public expenditure management and service delivery actions that need
to be taken in the PARPA priority sectors, based o n SWAP experience and the findings o f
the CPAR, CFAA and PERs. This w o u l d enable the Government to articulate a mediumterm action plan aiming to strengthen the fiduciary framework, improve the investment
climate, and build capacity and accountability with the support o f a PRSC series, to be
initiated in 2004. Following national elections, the Bank in 2005 would engage the new
Government in dialogue o n i t s growth and poverty reduction strategy, backed by an
institutional governance review drawing on the corruption surveys and the first in a series
o f annual PERs that will monitor PRSC implementation and inform efforts to update the
PAF matrix and PRSC program. The PRSC would continue to support improved public
expenditure management and also begin financing basic education and the agriculture
sector. At the same time, building o n AAA o n labor markets, a Technical and Vocational
Education project would be prepared to help address the critical manpower needs in
Mozambique and capacity-building projects focused o n the legal and financial sectors
would begin implementation. In FY06, a new CEM (drawing o n data from the new
household survey and focused o n growth) will help the new government to reevaluate
Mozambique’s development challenges and its sources o f growth. Provided that
expenditure management reforms have progressed satisfactorily, a third PRSC operation
would b e delivered in FY06, covering education, agriculture and also health, and the
second phase o f the Roads and Bridges APL, focused o n secondary and tertiary roads,
will b e initiated. In FY07, the PRSC m a y be expanded again to include rural water, and
the second phase o f the Public Sector Reform APL will also be initiated.
Indicatorsfor the Base Case. The indicators for the base case will be monitored
73.
o n an ongoing basis and will include:
0

Satisfactory implementation o f the macroeconomic program, as evidenced (for
example) by adherence to a Fund-supported PRGF arrangement;
Satisfactory implementation o f the PARPA and the priority actions incorporated into
the PAF matrix, as demonstrated in the annual PARPA Progress Reports;

- 39 -

Satisfactory implementation o f the national program to fight HIV/AIDS, as evidenced
by evaluations o f implementation o f the (updated) National Strategic Plan and the
M o H Strategic Plan; and
Satisfactory portfolio performance, including a disbursement ratio o f 16% to 20%,
less than 20% problem projects, and 100% proactivity.
Box 12: The IMF and Mozambique

Mozambique has had four Fund-supported programs since 1987. The IMF concluded the fifth and
final review o f i t s most recent program, a PRGF arrangement, in June 2003 and, in line with new
guidelines for prolonged users o f Fund resources, staff are n o w preparing an ex-post assessment o f
progress under t h i s and previous programs. Performance since 1987 has been strong, as the country
achieved macroeconomic stability and completed key structural reforms, yet challenges remain.
T o help address the unfinished agenda, including in particular in matters that fall into the Fund’s
core competencies (fiscal consolidation, financial sector refonn, and monetary and exchange rate
management), the Government has requested a successor Fund program. This will also help other
donors, as they continue to rely o n the Fund to assess macroeconomic performance. A new program, if
approved, may be a “low-access” PRGF arrangement, which would offer Mozambique Fund resources
at levels below Mozambique’s quota. In light o f the Government’s request for a successor program,
and in the context o f the fifth review o f the most recent PRGF arrangement, Fund staff in early 2003
reached an understanding with the Government o n quarterly indicative targets to monitor performance
during the remainder o f 2003. In addition, Fund staff have initiated discussions o n a macroeconomic
framework for 2004-06 and pending structural reforms (including actions and a preliminary timetable)
that could be supported by a possible successor arrangement. While a clear timeline i s difficult to
articulate at this point, it i s generally believed that a new PRGF arrangement will be presented to the
Fund’s Board by mid-2004.

74.
The high case scenario: The high case would result principally from an increase
in absorptive capacity, which would in turn result from significant progress in reforming
public administration, strengthening public and private sector governance, and expanding
skills and knowledge. Under the high case scenario, economic growth would exceed 7%
per annum for 2004 and beyond, due to timely implementation o f needed reforms as well
as increased investor confidence and private investment. As a result, the agricultural,
manufacturing, and tourism sectors would continue to expand, and exports would grow
more quickly, particularly outside the large-scale projects. The Government can realize a
high case through accelerated improvements in public expenditure management and the
implementation o f key structural and social policies, as evidenced by:
Complete divestiture o f the Government’s remaining stakes in the banking system,
thereby facilitating a substantial reduction in banking spreads and lending rates;
Accelerated implementation of public sector reform (including implementation o f six
key “quick wins”, as verified through service delivery surveys);
Accelerated implementation o f legal and judicial reform (including passage o f a
modern Commercial Code, liberalization o f labor legislation, and more timely
resolution o f court cases (including especially commercial cases));
A substantial reduction in the formal cost and time required to start up a business;
Significantly improved marketability o f land title;
The allocation of land use rights and natural resource concessions in a transparent and
competitive manner leading to optimum resource use; and

Maintenance o f portfolio performance at less than 10% problem projects, a
disbursement ratio o f more than 20%, and proactivity at 100%.

If these measures were completed and the base case indicators were maintained75.
an ambitious but achievable goal-lending could b e increased to as much as $180 m i l l i o n
per annum, or 30% per annum more than the base case. A s much as h a l f o f the additional
financing o f about $40 m i l l i o n per annum would b e allocated to the PRSCs, with the
remainder allocated to large-scale infrastructure lending (for example, an expanded
Roads and Bridges 2). N e w lending would also be considered for the power sector,
where Mozambique’s growth potential remains very high.
76.
The low case scenario: By contrast, significant slippage in implementing any o f
the core reforms would put Mozambique in the l o w case. Triggers for the l o w case
include:
0

0

0

0

Significant reversals in economic policies, especially related to macroeconomic
management, trade and real sector liberalization, leading to a more closed and
centrally-controlled economic environment;
Significant deviation f r o m poverty-reducing policies outlined in the PARPA
(including reductions in pro-poor spending percentages);
Civil strife or governance practices that cause external development partners to
reduce their level of support for an extended period; or
Significant deterioration in portfolio Performance (with problem projects greater than
20% and a disbursement ratio less than 16% for an extended period o f time).

77.
Whatever the cause, the l o w case would probably involve recession, increasing
and ultimately high inflation, decreased investor confidence, and a pronounced and
extended decline in external assistance. This in time w o u l d result in real declines in
social spending and a reversal in progress towards the MDGs. Under this scenario, which
i s believed to be unlikely, IDA support in the form o f programmatic PRSC lending would
cease, and the administrative savings generated f r o m limiting the preparation o f new
financing w o u l d be allocated to additional AAA to strengthen the policy dialogue, assess
the Government’s commitment to its poverty reduction strategy, and advise i t o n
improving economic management. The precise nature and scope o f the additional AAA
would depend o n the reasons for Mozambique’s slippage into the l o w case, though the
PERs and the Institutional Governance Review w o u l d remain important and be
continued.
Mid-term review: At the end o f FY05, a C A S Progress Report will b e prepared
78.
and discussed with the new Government and the Board, inter alia to provide a basis for
making mid-course corrections. I t i s likely that the AAA agenda will be revised at that
time, based o n the priorities o f the new government and k e y issues that need to be
addressed at that juncture.

RESULTS-BASED MONITORING AND EVALUATION

79.
This results-based C A S seeks clearly to indicate intended outcomes o f the Bank’s
strategy, and to allow subsequent evaluation o f that strategy. The results framework (see
core country outcomes related to long-term national
Table 7 and Annex 1) identifies: (i)
associated intermediate outcomes
development goals as articulated in the PARPA; (ii)
the mix o f Bank products
(i.e. benchmarks) that IDA can directly help to realize; and (iii)
and services that best contributes to these outcomes. An integral part o f the strategy shift
toward a results-based C A S i s the strengthening o f the C A S M&E architecture, which
will serve as the basis for self-assessment in the C A S Progress Report to be prepared in
FY05 (for mid-course correction) and C A S Completion Report to b e prepared in FY07
(for ex-post learning). Results o f these assessments will feed into the next C A S cycle.
80.
Since Bank activities are aligned with national development goals, systems to
monitor progress also need to be aligned. The C A S results framework i s therefore linked
to the Government’s PARPA monitoring matrix and will use the same data collection
mechanisms. The need to improve M&E o f the W o r l d Bank’s existing portfolio was
identified during the 2003 CPPR and i s part o f the CPPR Action Plan.
8 1.
The Government i s committed to developing a results-oriented public service
which i s accountable to citizens. The systems and the culture necessary to support this
objective are not yet in place. Policies and resource allocations need to b e informed by a
sustainable M&E system, which complements the budget system, human resource
management, and auditing functions, as a public sector management tool.
82.
Mozambique has limited capacity to produce reliable and regular data on many
k e y indicators, including poverty and MDG indicators. I t i s important to build
sustainable capacity to collect data and report on core indicators periodically. This will
involve scaling-up activities to strengthen national statistical capacity, particularly in
PARPA priority sectors, to complement support already being provided by bilateral
donor partners, notably the G11 and DANIDA.
The availability and quality o f administrative data-particularly expenditure
83.
data-is poor, and information on the link between expenditures and programs, targets,
outputs and outcomes i s generally not available. Moreover, there i s little demand for
such information within Government; the demand comes primarily from donors and c i v i l
society. Critical skills are lacking in (for example) policy analysis and evaluation and indepth poverty analysis. Concerted and sustained efforts are needed to: (i)
emphasize the
establish the
importance, relevance and benefits o f an effective M&E system; (ii)
foundational elements needed to develop a results-based orientation in the public sector;
explore ways to generate internal demand.
and (iii)
84.
Based o n a rapid assessment undertaken by Bank staff in M a y 2003, action areas
include: (i)
improving the institutionalframework by promoting a culture o f
strengthening central and
accountability and an incentives system to support it; (ii)
sectoral ministry information systems; (iii)
strengthening M&E skills for clearer goal-

- 42 -

setting within the planning process, improved project and program management, financial
management, policy analysis, in-depthpoverty analysis, and performance auditing (here
capacity needs to be built both within Government, at the central, sectoral, provincial
levels, and within c i v i l society); and finally (iv) improving donor coordination. A more
thorough review and extensive consultation will be needed to identify priority issues and
an appropriate sequence for addressing them.

The World Bank and other donors are already engaged in strengthening M&E
85.
capacity, particularly through supporting public sector reform and the development o f an
integrated financial management information system (SISTAFE). Discussions are
underway regarding how the Bank might best support the Government in rapidly
developing and implementing a prioritized M&E enhancement plan, to complement the
support o f other donor partners, and these discussions will be continued in the context o f
preparation o f the first PRSC. Possible funding mechanisms include PRSP Trust Funds,
an IDF grant or a Statistical Capacity APL (STATCAP). See Annex 6 for more details.
MANAGING R I S K S

The Bank’s program faces two types o f risks which the Country Team needs to
86.
monitor and manage over the next few years: country risks and r i s k s pertaining to Bank
performance. The country risks are related to domestic political developments, regional
and international political and economic developments, domestic limitations on
absorptive capacity, and the expected impact o f the H I V / A I D S epidemic:
0

0

Local elections will take place in November 2003 and national elections in late 2004.
Uncertainty over their outcome could lead the Government to lose focus and fail to
implement needed reforms; contention about the reported results may also lead to a
period o f instability, possibly marred by violence. Whatever party wins, the new
Government will also need time to learn to govern, and there i s always the risk that i t
will initiate an inappropriate shift in policy direction. The Government’s
commitment to free and fair elections (achieved in all previous elections) as well as
i t s efforts to engage society in articulating a national vision through the Agenda 2025
exercise and monitoring PAFWA implementation through the Poverty Observatory
will help to mitigate some o f these risks. In addition, the Bank will try to mitigate
them by actively engaging the key political parties prior to elections on the main
development challenges facing Mozambique; preparing a CAS Progress Report (late
FY05) that will be discussed with the Government (and the Board); and preparing a
C E M in FY06 o n the challenge o f sustainable broad-based growth.
An extended global slowdown, commodity price fluctuations, international
agricultural trade barriers, regional political and economic developments (particularly
in South Afr-ica and Zimbabwe), and exchange rate and foreign capital flow
fluctuations, could each impede growth and make i t difficult for the Government to
remain engaged in reform. To help mitigate these risks, the Bank will work closely
with the Fund and like-minded donors to help the Government to maintain
macroeconomic stability; i t will also address some o f the larger geopolitical issues
throughout i t s policy dialogue at senior levels.

- 43 -

D u e to its geographical location, Mozambique i s prone to natural disasters such as
floods and droughts, which limit growth, drain public resources, preoccupy Govemment with short-term relief measures, and reduce incomes and welfare. The Bank
will help to address these risks through AAA o n regional water resource management
focused o n disaster prevention and through strengthening the social safety net (the
Decentralized Planning and Finance Project will provide a vehicle for income
transfers as needed in response to natural disasters). In addition, new infrastructure
projects will be provided with some unallocated funds to enable the IDA portfolio to
b e restructured rapidly to respond to disaster-induced exigencies as they arise.
Mozambique’s limited human and institutional capacity could undermine C A S
implementation. In particular, inadequate fiduciary controls and a failure to
strengthen public financial accountability could result in increased corruption, which
w o u l d undermine Government credibility and private-sector confidence and possibly
prompt development partners to withhold support. T o mitigate this risk the Bank i s
working closely with the Government and other donors to improve the fiduciary
framework through i t s AAA, backed by the PRSCs, support to public sector reform,
and extensive capacity-building at national and sub-national levels o f government.
The devastating effects o f the H I V / A I D S epidemic threatens Mozambique’s growth
potential in many ways. I t s adverse impact o n c i v i l service capacity and labor
productivity i s already obvious. Failure o f leadership to bring about behavioural
change will have an adverse effect o n PARPA and C A S implementation. The Bank
and other partners are attempting to mitigate this risk by helping the Government to
strengthen the National A I D S Secretariat and to finance appropriate H I V / A I D S
prevention and care programs through the Bank-supported Multisectoral A I D S
Program, the Global Fund, the Clinton Foundation and other sources which channel
resources to front-line implementers with experience in fighting HIV/AIDS.
There are also t w o risks that are institutional risks for the Bank and that the
87.
Country Team i s monitoring closely:

Mozambique is heavily dependent o n external aid made available by a large number
o f donors, o f which the Bank i s only one. Inadequate donor coordination could lead
to duplicative efforts, multiple parallel structures and contradictory policy advice
which would erode already-weak Government capacity. T o mitigate this risk, the
Bank i s working closely with other donors, including in particular the G11, to
harmonize policies and processes through SWAPS and the development o f a common
set o f indicators goveming the provision o f budget support.
M&E systems are very weak in Mozambique, making i t difficult to track the use o f
resources and progress in program implementation. T o address this issue, the Bank i s
working closely with the IMF and several bilateral donors to support the
implementation o f SISTAFE and the Poverty Observatory, w h i c h i s institutionalising
broader participation in the monitoring o f PARPA implementation.

CONCLUSION

88.
Mozambique i s a poor country which has real potential for growth as w e l l as a
Government that has demonstrated commitment to poverty reduction, manifested by a
sound reform program and, most recently, its PARPA Progress Report. Preliminary data
indicate that the country’s potential, coupled with its commitment and programs, are
beginning to yield results. Yet there are daunting challenges and risks to be confronted if
Mozambique’s full potential i s to b e realized. The Bank has played an important role in
supporting Mozambique’s progress since the 1992 Peace Accord. Selecting the right
development constraints to address at the right time, in an environment o f significant
commitment but limited capacity, has been an important contributor to the success o f the
Government and o f the W o r l d Bank Group in Mozambique. This C A S proposes that the
Bank, with some shifts in focus, continue i t s strong support to Mozambique over the next
four years. Improving the investment climate, expanding service delivery, and building
capacity and accountability are all part o f the long-term agenda for poverty reduction in
Mozambique and over time are likely to continue to contribute to Mozambique’s growing
success.

Annex 2
Mozambique CAS FY01-03 Completion Report’

This C A S Completion Report (CASCR) aims to evaluate the effectiveness o f the
1.
current Bank C A S for Mozambique (Report N o . 20521-MOZYdated June 14,2000). The
findings o f this Report have informed the new CAS. This CASCR i s based o n a selfassessment o f the Country Team as w e l l as an analysis o f the financing and non-financing
programs, including AAA ( reviewed in a country-specific QAG retrospective), Project
Status Reports, and Implementation Completion Reports completed during the CAS
period. Since the June 2000 CAS, OED completed four I C R reviews and one Project
Performance Assessment, but there has been n o Progress Report and no Country
Assistance Evaluation (the last Country Assistance Review was completed in 1998).
Between July 2000 and June 2003, Mozambique maintained a high economic
2.
growth rate, despite a sharp but temporary drop following the 2000 floods. Nonetheless,
Mozambique’s rank in the United Nations Human Development Index slipped from 168
out o f 174 countries to 170 out o f 175 countries, mainly due to a decrease in l i f e
expectancy resulting from AIDS-related mortality, which offset an increase in GDP per
capita and the gross enrolment ratio. Poverty remains high, although preliminary studies
indicate that incomes have increased and the overall poverty headcount has decreased. In
the intervening period, HIV prevalence was reassessed and the rate adjusted downward,
from 17% to 15%, although the overall trend remains upward and some provinces (Tete,
Sofala and Manica) have reported levels o f 2 1% among adults.

The conclusion o f this C A S C R i s ,that the Bank’s C A S was (and is) relevant to the
3.
longer-term development goals o f Mozambique and that many o f the C A S objectives
were achieved (sometimes with delay), although some were not achieved. In particular,
articulate a more coherent,
over the C A S period, the Bank helped the Government to: (i)
improve transparency
comprehensive, and results-oriented poverty reduction strategy; (ii)
and accountability in public expenditure management; (ii)
improve the provision o f k e y
infrastructure services; (iv) expand access to social services o f a reasonable quality,
thereby helping to improve social indicators; and (v) improve its capacity for emergency
response. At the same time, the Bank’s strategy was less clear and i t s achievements more
capacity-building assistance to the central bank
limited in several areas. In particular: (i)
failed to prevent the banking sector difficulties o f 2000-2001 or to address structural
weaknesses in the financial sector, which came to occupy center stage during the C A S
advice and activities concerning agriculture and rural development were
period; (ii)
inadequate to address the k e y issues in these areas (e.g. rural finance and land titling were
relatively neglected) and a planned rural development strategy was significantly delayed;
and (iii),
despite frequent Bank dialogue with senior officials about the need to ease
regulatory and administrative constraints to business to improve growth and poverty
reduction, many remain.

4.
This Report also finds that, where the Bank was successful, the outcomes were
achieved through a stronger focus on improving the impact o f i t s program through
a
decentralization o f the Country Director to Maputo, where this involved: (i)
strengthened partnership within the World Bank Group and between the Bank Group and
the Government; (ii)
expanded outreach and public information activities, particularly incountry; and (iii)
enhanced donor coordination, focusing on partners’ comparative
advantages, particularly through the SWAps and the P A F matrix discussions involving
the G11. Stability in the political environment during CAS implementation also
contributed to attaining the results.
A.

Mozambique’s Longer-Term Strategic Goals

5.
The June 2000 CAS was developed during the time that the Government
formulated a new Five-Year Program (2000-2004) and also prepared an Action Plan for
the Reduction o f Absolute Poverty (PARPA) as part o f i t s interim PRSP. This interim
document was subsequently developed into the PARPA 2001-2005 (the “PARPA”). The
Council o f Ministers approved the PARPA in April 2001, ten months after the CAS was
discussed by the Board, and the Bank and Fund Boards endorsed it as Mozambique’s f i r s t
full PRSP in August 2001. The PARPA’s public action strategy emphasizes economic
growth, public investment in human capital and productive infrastructure, and
institutional reform to improve the environment for private investment. Growth i s
expected to come from large-scale capital-intensive projects financed by private foreign
capital; productivity and value-added gains in agriculture and manufacturing; and a
general expansion in internal trade, transport and services. T o implement this strategy,
the PARPA, in line with i t s poverty diagnosis, identifies six priority areas for action:
health, education, infrastructure (roads, energy and water), agriculture and rural
development, governance, and macroeconomic and financial policies. The PARPA also
identifies actionable measures within each priority area and establishes targets and
milestones in an operational matrix.

6.
The strategy set out in the PARPA i s consistent with the strategy that was
previously set out in the Five Year Program and the PARPA 2000-2004. Bank and Fund
staff in their August 2001 Joint Staff Assessment found that, by comparison to previous
poverty reduction strategies, the PARPA increased country ownership; improved
prioritization; included clearer monitorable targets; and improved the integration o f
policies, reforms and sectoral programs. They also identified a need for further
development of the poverty analysis; o f the prioritization, sequencing and implementation o f the policy actions identified; and o f the participatory process which led to the
strategy. In short, the PARPA was more robust than the Government’s previous poverty
strategies, but i t did not change their overall analysis or policy direction.
B.

CAS Objectives

7.
The primary goal o f the Government o f Mozambique i s to achieve a permanent
reduction in poverty through sustained broad-based growth; and this i s also the goal o f
the CAS. The Bank’s CAS explicitly aligned i t s e l f with the overall goals o f the Five
53

Year Program and the emerging PARPA 2000-2004. The CAS pillars2 and the 12 more
specific development objectives specified in the program matrix explicitly reflect the
structure, overall goals and sub-goals o f the Government’s strategic documents, although
the CAS, in accordance with the Bank’s mandate, does not support political governance
or Government efforts to maintain peace, ensure public safety, or protect human rights.

8.
Within this framework, the first CAS objective was to increase economic
opportunities through private sector-led growth, where this included promoting rural
development and agriculture; strengthening the financial sector; decreasing the regulatory
and administrative constraints o n businesses; increasing efficiency in the provision o f
infrastructure services (particularly electricity and transportation); and ensuring sound
environmental management. The second objective was to improve governance and
empowerment, where this included reforming the public sector and improving the r u l e o f
law. Finally, the third objective was to increase human capabilities, where this included
preventing and reducing HIV/AIDS; improving health and education; and ensuring social
protection. The CAS also sought to strengthen development partnerships.
9.
The program matrix for the June 2000 CAS included 19 Bank performance
indicators, chosen from among 47 Government performance indicators that were also
listed (see Table 1). These indicators in retrospect did not constitute an appropriate set o f
indicators o f Bank performance. First, the matrix explicitly stated that these indicators
would be revised after the PARPA was finalized, but this was not formally accomplished
until the recent PAF matrix exercise was completed, when i t was too late to track the
Bank’s mid-term performance. Second, the Bank indicators were concentrated in an
unrepresentative subset o f (primarily sectoral) Bank activities (education had four;
agriculture, health, and roads three each; and HIV/AIDS, social protection, railways,
electricity, urban water, and water resource management one each), and the second CAS
pillar (governance) had n o B a n k performance indicators at all.

10.
Since the Bank Performance indicators in the June 2000 CAS do not capture the
full range o f the Bank’s activities and outcomes, it i s worth reflecting o n the Bank’s
FYO1-03 program to extrapolate overall outcomes that the Bank helped to achieve, even
though the Bank did not explicitly target these outcomes, as such, in the CAS itself. An
analysis o f Bank performance implementing the program i s included in Section D below,
while Appendix 1 rovides a detailed description o f the financing and non-financing
instruments (ESW and advisory services) and their relevance to the CAS objectives.

The requirements for formal ESW were revised during FYO1, and products originally designed as formal

Study underway

are aligned with the PARPA, Bank activities contributed to outcomes realized during the
C A S period but did not achieve them alone. M a n y o f the outcomes achieved during the
C A S are described in the Government’s first PARPA Progress Report, completed in early
2003. In discussing this Progress Report in June and July 2003, the Boards o f the Bank
and the Fund found that Mozambique’s efforts to implement the PARPA are sufficient
evidence o f its commitment to poverty reduction and that the PARPA continues to
provide a credible poverty reduction framework as w e l l as a sound basis for concessional
assistance. Reflection o n the Progress Report, Project Status Reports, Implementation
Completion Reports, client feedback, and Country Team self-assessments indicate that
the following overall outcomes were achieved:
0

0

0

1.

A more coherent, articulated, and results-oriented poverty reduction strategy
(PARPA), which i s beginning to incorporate the M D G s and coordinate donor
activities around Government systems.
A stronger Government focus on transparency and accountability in public
expenditure management, chiefly through joint PERs and project support to
public sector reform and decentralization.
Higher-quality infrastructure services at better costs, achieved through
investments supporting public works (chiefly roads) and expanding private-sector
participation in the provision o f infrastructure services (especially in ports,
railways, urban water supply, and telecommunications).
Greater access of the poor to social services o f a reasonable quality, chiefly
through projects supporting c i v i l works and training in primary health care,
education (at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels), and rural water supply.
M o r e responsive aid modalities, shifting away f r o m emergency response and
humanitarian assistance, as w e l l as Government accountability to the donors,
towards long-tenn reconstruction and development, and greater mutual
accountability between the Government and the donors and o f the Government to
the people.

A more coherent, articulated, and results-oriented poverty reduction strategy

12.
The first and most comprehensive outcome that the Bank helped to achieve i s a
stronger and more articulated poverty reduction strategy, encompassing all sectors and
levels o f Government. While the C A S aimed to support the Government’s poverty
reduction strategy as articulated in the PARPA, it also helped the Government to reassess
its priorities; develop a more focused and effective reform program, that i s led by the
Government; articulate more exactly the appropriate roles for the public and private
sectors, particularly in the provision o f infrastructure services; and build public capacity
for program implementation, including M&E. In addition, the Bank helped the
Government to complete the PARPA and obtain debt relief under the Enhanced H I P C
Initiative. A k e y recent achievement was the joint Government-donor articulation o f a
Performance Assessment Framework (PAF), w h i c h was initiated by the G11 and which
involved extensive Bank assistance in preparing a first PAF matrix o f medium-term
program actions and indicators. A s the matrix will b e updated twice a year-just before

just after MPF reports o n the previous year’s budget outtum in February-the PAF
matrix also operationalizes the Government’s commitment to ensuring that the PARPA
i s a living document.
13.
T o help the Government to refine its poverty reduction strategy o n a continuing
basis, the Bank Group completed various analytical and advisory activities, including a
CEM (prepared with the Government in 2001), a two-volume PER (the first volume in
FYOl and the second in FY03), and an expenditure-tracking assessment in the health
sector (such assessments are also underway in education, agriculture, roads and water).
A study o f the impact o f HIV/AIDS o n growth was also completed.

14.
Completion o f the HIV/AIDS study decisively shifted the emphasis o f the overall
Government program during the CAS period. By bringing the scope and consequences
o f the pandemic to the forefront o f policy discussions in Mozambique, the Bank helped to
make the fight against H I V / A I D S a more prominent aspect o f the Government’s
development program. The Bank led by example, in that it retrofitted H I V / A I D S fighting components into its existing portfolio. In addition, the Bank along with several
donors helped establish the National A I D S Secretariat, strengthen i t s capacity to
implement the National A I D S Strategy, and identify the resources to do so. M o s t o f
these activities were completed in the course o f preparing the Bank’s H I V / A I D S project,
which was approved (with grant financing) in M a r c h 2003.

15.

Bank efforts to reduce rural poverty have had m i x e d results. The Bank played a
k e y role in establishing a common funding mechanism for donor support to the
Government’s agriculture program, PROAGRI,4leading to some positive results. In
short, a donor-driven proliferation o f projects in the sector was substantially reduced (100
projects were reduced to less than 20); MADER was provided with equipment, supplies,
and technical assistance; irrigation systems were repaired; decentralization o f planning,
budgeting and management to the provinces and districts was meaningfully undertaken;
and some extension and veterinary services were outsourced to private providers. That
said, IDA was one o f the last donors to contribute to the pool; IDA disbursements into the
pool have been l o w (because program implementation i s slow, with some teething
problems s t i l l being addressed); and, most importantly, it i s not clear that policy
improvements or better services to farmers (particularly PROAGRI services) explain
reported gains in crop production since 2000. Outside agriculture, Bank activities in the
water, transport, and energy sector have helped to relieve rural poverty, though the
benefits o f these activities to the rural population, and in particular the poor, have been
below expectations and some k e y issues (such as rural finance) have not been adequately
addressed (see Appendix 1).

The mechanism, which was agreed between the Government and 18 donors, including the Bank, accords
w i t h IDA procurement and financial management procedures.

58

2.

A stronger focus on sound public expenditure management

16.
During C A S implementation, political and economic governance took center
stage in the overall growth and poverty agenda. The policy dialogue in different sectors
increasingly involved cross-sector themes o f employee incentives, procurement, financial
management, monitoring and evaluation, and interministerial coordination (particularly
between MPF and line ministries and among different levels o f government). The Bank
helped to mainstream these issues through extensive AAA, including the two-volume
PER, a CFAA, and a CPAR; through supporting the articulation o f a public sector reform
strategy (Bank AAA in this area focused, inter alia, on pay reform, the policy process,
and the role o f government) which IDA i s financing with its Public Sector Reform
project; and through helping to implement the deconcentration and decentralization
processes. In addition, as part o f i t s preparation o f the Public Sector Reform project, IDA
supported the development o f an action plan for c i v i l service salary reform as w e l l as the
design and implementation o f a “quick wins” program, under which all ministries were
required to design and implement the re-engineering o f k e y processes linking the public
services to citizen^.^
Decentralization has become an increasingly prominent part o f the Government’s
17.
program. Over the C A S period, decentralized levels o f government-provinces,
municipalities (autarquias), and districts-were increasingly empowered to raise taxes,
provide services, and implement sector programs in their jurisdictions. The Bank has
been supporting decentralization reform since its inception and particularly after the first
municipal elections in 2000. In agriculture, through PROAGRI, intra-sector budget
transfers to districts increased from 40% to 60% to bring resources closer to beneficiaries,
and in health and education, rural services were strengthened to reduce geographical
inequalities. In addition, I D A ’ s Municipal Development project has supported “learning
by doing” in five large municipalities, and its Decentralized Planning and Finance project
i s adapting this approach to selected districts in the four central provinces.

3.

Higher-quality infrastructure services at better costs

18.
Over the past three years, Mozambique has continued to attract substantial foreign
direct investment. The Bank Group helped to make Mozambique a better business
address by supporting legal reforms enabling private sector participation in ports,
railways, energy, telecommunications, and air transportation. I D A ’ s Railway and Port
Restructuring project helped to concession b o t h the Ressano-Garcia railway line and the
port o f Maputo, while a concession o f the Nacala port-railway system i s nearing financial
closure; the project has also supported the restructuring o f the national railway company,
Empresa Portos e Caminhos de Ferro de MoCambique (CFM). In energy, Bank support
through the Energy Reform project i s helping to separate the distribution function from
the national electricity company, Electricidade de MoCambique (EdM), with a view to
Three quick wins have been achieved to date (reducing land registration time from three years to 90 days,
once a l l documentation i s in place; developing a “one-stop shop” for business registration in Maputo; and
issuing visas at the border) and three others are expected next year (simplifying public sector recruitment;
improving the pensions payments process; and simplifying hospital administrative processes).

59

liberalizing the distribution market; IDA i s also helping to integrate Mozambique more
fully into the Southem Africa Power Pool by planning a Malawi-Mozambique
interconnection, which IDA i s expected to finance under the new CAS. In
telecommunications, w i t h assistance fi-om IDA’SCommunications Reform project, a new
legal framework was approved to liberalize the sector; mCel, a mobile
telecommunications company, was incorporated independently o f TdM; and Vodacom
was brought into the mobile market, leading to higher teledensity and competitive
pressure on price and quality o f service. The Communications Reform project also
helped to achieve a legal change that foresees private sector participation in the national
airline, Lineas Aereas de MoCambique (LAM). All o f these initiatives are helping to
lower the costs o f doing business in Mozambique; to give the private sector a larger stake
in the Mozambican economy; and to reduce the demands made on Govemment capacity
and refocus it on core government functions.

The Bank also helped to improve road transportation and urban water supply.
19.
Two IDA Roads projects are supporting the rehabilitation and maintenance o f the trunk
road network, with a focus o n connecting all provincial capitals, as well as reform o f key
sector institutions (in particular, the creation o f an independent road authority and Road
Fund-though, as a result o f l o w Government commitment, the latter objective has not
yet been realized). The Bank i s monitoring the impact o f road improvement on poverty
and expects greater interconnectivity (of people to markets, schools and clinics) to reduce
business costs and (indirectly) to improve social indicators. In urban water supply, the
Bank’s second National Water Development project helped to introduce a private
operator, Aguas de Mocambique (AdM), that, despite flood-related setbacks in 2000, has
increased access by 20% in Beira and 40% in Nampula; brought 90% o f water samples
into compliance with Government requirements; and doubled tariffs to improve cost
recovery, thereby helping to ensure sustainability and (ultimately) reinvestment and
expansion. In addition, the Bank has supported the operations o f the asset holder
(FIPAG) and an independent regulatory agency (CRA) that i t has helped to create.
W i t h two IDNGEF projects (Tranfrontier Conservation Areas and Coastal and
20.
Marine Biodiversity), the Bank has also helped to develop sustainable tourism as a source
o f growth, by supporting reforms aimed at ensuring sustainable environmental
management. In particular, the Bank provided direct support to the creation o f the
Greater Limpopo National Park, a transfrontier park straddling Mozambique, South
Africa and Zimbabwe; helped increase community involvement in land demarcation; and
also helped to define guidelines for private sector participation in sustainable tourism.
The Bank Group has also provided support to private sector development in other
2 1.
ways, in particular by undertaking a second assessment o f the investment climate
(allowing trend data for the period 1998 to 2002 to be developed and to inform the
Govemment’s evolving program as well as the new CAS); helping to create the
conditions for international operators to invest in mining; promoting the development o f
the Pande and Temane gas fields through IBRD and MIGA guarantees to a private
investor; as well as through increased IFC exposure in banking, tourism, paper,
agribusiness and S M E development, including to develop linkages between

60

Mozambican-owned businesses and the Mozal aluminum smelter. In cooperation with
the IMF, the Bank also undertook extensive AAA and provided advisory services relating
to the status o f the banking sector and the constraints affecting the financial sector more
generally.

4.

Greater access of the poor to social services of a reasonable quality

Access to and the quality o f basic social services improved during the C A S
22.
period, with Bank assistance being particularly important in education. IDA financing
supported the Government’s Education Sector Support Program (ESSP)-a nascent
SWAp that focuses o n teacher training, school construction and rehabilitation, female
enrollment, and institutional capacity-building-and it has been the only major donor
working in tertiary education (through a university-oriented Higher Education project and
preparation o f a Technical and Vocational Education project). The Bank has helped to
increase capacity for strategic planning and coordination around sector priorities and to
design the Education for All Fast-Track Initiative. Results o n the ground surpassed
expectations, as gross enrolment rates for EP1 (grades 1 to 5) and EP2 (grades 6 and 7)
and girls enrolment at the primary and secondary levels exceeded targets, though the
recent (MDG-influenced) shift to a focus o n completion rates indicates that much remains
to be done to ensure that enrolled children achieve literacy, numeracy and the l i f e skills
needed to b e productive members o f society. The Higher Education project also started
well, providing support to the design and implementation o f a new l a w that (inter alia)
established the Ministry o f Higher Education as w e l l as a National Institute o f Distance
Education and a Provincial Scholarship Fund; as a result, access to tertiary education
improved o n several dimensions (gender, geography, and income level) and graduation
numbers are increasing.

In the health sector, the C A S through i t s Health Sector Recovery project aimed to
23.
rehabilitate k e y facilities, finance k e y equipment and supplies, support disease-related
research (on malaria, hepatitis B and HIV/AIDS), improve expenditure management, and
strengthen the Government’s capacity for planning and for donor coordination, all with a
view to improving access t o basic services and reducing geographical inequalities.
During the C A S period, the Government finalized a Health Sector Strategy Plan and
some k e y outcomes reached or remained at significantly higher levels than a 1996
baseline (e.g. IMR fell f r o m 162 to 126 (in 2000); intra-hospital MMR fell from 230 to
160 (in 2002); the percentage o f health posts staffed with trained personnel rose from
70% to 92%; and the percentage o f first-level facilities stocked with drugs rose from 40%
to 71%). Although most PARPA and MDG indicators in the sector remain distant,
increased Government capacity, focus and commitment are sustaining positive trends.

More responsive aid modalities

Under the CAS, the Bank also helped to consolidate a shifi in aid modalities away
24.
from emergency response and humanitarian assistance, as w e l l as Govemment
accountability to the donors, towards long-term reconstruction and development and
greater mutual accountability between the Government and the donors and o f the

61

Government to the people. The 2000 and 2001 flood emergencies were, in retrospect, a
test o f Mozambique’s ability to manage a crisis while still respecting institutional
processes, checks and balances that had been built up, painstakingly, since the end o f the
conflict in 1992. The Bank, by providing timely assistance to define the extent o f the
emergency, mobilize needed resources (including through IDA’SFlood Emergency
Recovery proj ect),6 and coordinate a costed and prioritized longer-term development
response to the emergency, helped to ensure that Mozambique did not drift back to a
development paradigm that emphasized short-term humanitarian assistance channeled
principally through non-governmental channels. The experience and lessons learned
from the 2000 flood o n the Incomati and the Limpopo helped the Govemment to manage
the 2001 floods o n the Zambezi with considerably improved humanitarian outcomes.

As noted in paragraph 12, the joint Government-donor articulation o f the PAF
25.
constitutes a major step forward in operationalizing the PARPA as a “living” document.
Less obvious, but equally important, the PAF and its accompanying matrix (which
includes a relatively selective group o f explicitly-identified priority actions and
indicators) also constitute an important step in increasing Government accountability to
the people o f Mozambique and the donors, and donor accountability to the Government,
as the G11 and the Bank have committed to providing budget support against the
achievement of the prioritized PAF matrix indicators. While the Government and the
donors have not yet fully determined what sort o f donor “response mechanism” will b e
deployed in this context, it i s clear that this shift in aid modalities enacts a growing
that
consensus among development partners around several important principles: (i)
donors should provide assistance in ways that are better aligned with the beneficiary
that donors should reward relatively good
government’s o w n development priorities; (ii)
that aid-flow
performers by making aid flows more predictable and long-term; and (iii)
predictability increasingly implies conditionality derived more directly from the
beneficiary’s o w n development program as w e l l as increased assistance allocated to
operating costs as opposed to capital investment (as progress in countries like
Mozambique n o w depends more o n funding recurrent costs, e.g. to run and staff schools
and clinics, than o n new c i v i l works).
D.

Measuring Bank Performance

26.
Bank assistance to Mozambique started in 1987, five years before the end o f the
c i v i l war. T o date, Mozambique has received $2.4 b i l l i o n in IDA credits through 37
investment projects and seven adjustment operations. IDA allocations have been
increasing steadily since 1987, and the sector composition has remained relatively
consistent during this period, reflecting Government demands and the Bank’s
comparative advantage vis-a-vis other development partners. Total cumulative IDA
The Bank’s response was well-integrated and much wider than the Flood Emergency Recovery project
alone. In addition: (i)
the Bank, in cooperation with the Government and the donor community, completed
a preliminary multisectoral damage assessment within weeks o f the flooding; (ii)
it approve accelerated
HIPC-related debt relief to cover the totality o f debt service due during the twelve months following the
floods; and (iii)
it retrofitted i t s portfolio to include emergency response components in ongoing operations
(particularly in the areas o f road transportation, health sector rehabilitation, and rural water supply).

62

commitments to Mozambique increased over the CAS period from $768 million in 2000
to $1,094 million in 2003, while the number o f projects increased from 15 to 18 at endFY03 (16 t ~ d a y ) . ~
27.
As detailed in Appendix 2 to this CASCR, the Bank delivered ten projects and
one adjustment operation during CAS implementation (through September 30,2003),
with a total new commitment o f $574 million (including $8 1 million in IDA grants),
which exceeded planned lending o f $455 million. Although the number o f financing
operations delivered met base-case expectations, delays in project preparation, effectiveness and implementation limited the development impact o f the portfolio. In particular,
several large infrastructure projects experienced slow disbursements and three projects
had unsatisfactory progress ratings through much o f the CAS period (all but one project
are now in satisfactory status). In addition, an ambitious AAA program, though it completed all due diligence economic work, completed only part o f the planned sector work
(see B o x 6 o f the CAS), w i t h some formal outputs converted to informal ones.
28.
The sector composition o f the portfolio reflected the CAS objectives and were in
line with Mozambique’s overall development objectives. In particular, infrastructure
represented 50% o f the portfolio (of which transportation-roads, ports and railwayswas 40% and water and energy 10%). The social sectors represented 20%, with most
resources going to basic health care, HIV/AIDS and education. Financing to improve
economic management and strengthen the private sector as well as the financial sector
absorbed 17%, while governance represented 3%. The program was also backloaded.
New IDA commitments in FYOl totaled $18 million, but rose to $271 million in FY02
and $201 million in FY03-a year that also included IDA’Sfirst provision o f grant
financing to Mozambique ($26 million for the Public Sector Reform project and $55
million for the HIV/AIDS project).
29.
Implementation of the portfolio proved to be challenging. Disbursements
declined sharply between 2001 and 2002 and they remain below the regional average,
with a total o f $630 m i l l i o n in undisbursed commitments at the end o f FY03, or over half
o f the total IDA allocation: this reflects in part the fact that large infrastructure projects
typically involve c i v i l works procurements that proceed slowly, at least initially, from
commitments to disbursements. The number o f problem projects rose from one in FY02
to three for most o f FY03, before falling back to one (Coastal and Marine Biodiversity) in
early FY04 as a result o f greater proactivity. Portfolio ratings indicate that the most
common issues encountered relate to procurement, and monitoring and evaluation. In
addition, a few cross-cutting constraints frequently impede implementation. These
include: (i)
the availability and transfer o f Government counterpart funds; (ii)
slow
low
procurement, resulting from capacity as well as procedural constraints; (iii)
disbursement rates (due in part to (i)
and (ii));
and (iv) limited M&E capacity.

30.
Improved portfolio performance in late FY03 and early F Y 0 4 was partly the result
o f two CPPRs held in 2003. The April 2003 CPPR noted that the portfolio has been

’

One project, Transfrontier Conservation Areas, closed o n June 30,2003, and another, Health Sector
Recovery Program, closed o n August 3 1,2003,

63

adversely affected by problems already highlightedin the FYOl CPPR and that many
could have been addressed earlier, if sufficient resources and a stronger partnership had
been in place. In particular, the portfolio suffered in FY02 from insufficient supervision
resources. Moreover, the Bank’s technical assistance could only partly address the
Government’s demand for capacity building and advisory services, and the GovernmentBank partnership gave inadequate attention to the need for real-time M&E systems to
improve performance indicators and outcomes.

A review also shows that extensions o f closing date have increased the age o f the
3 1.
portfolio. During the CAS period, four projects were extended, and their ages ranged
from six to nine years. These extensions imposed a heavy burden, by diverting limited
resources to continuing supervision o f projects that were already getting to be out-ofdate. In several cases, extensions were granted to offset delays in effectiveness and
implementation.
E.

Consultation and Coordination with Development Partners

32.
Throughout the CAS period, the Bank recognized the importance o f strengthening
the development partnership with the Government and the people o f Mozambique as well
as with Mozambique’s other development partners. The Bank confirmed its comparative
advantage as a leading development partner in advising the Government on key policy
issues and a catalytic force behind multi-donor programs in different sectors. In this
process, the Bank has increasingly sought to maximize the impact o f i t s interventions by
focusing o n greater Government ownership and donor coordination. This has involved,
inter alia, stronger partnership within the Bank Group, particularly in promoting publicprivate partnerships in infrastructure (such as the IDA, IBRD, I F C and MIGA partnership
in the gas development project, IDA and MIGA support to the CPI, and IDA and IFC
collaboration o n promoting SMEs and completing the Investment Climate Assessment).

33.
A key strategic priority o f the Bank’s program during the CAS period was to
improve development effectiveness through enhanced partnerships, particularly with
other development partners, including c i v i l society and the private sector. The Bank has
helped to rally stakeholders around the PARPA and, more recently, it has made important
contributions to the PAF, where i t has worked very closely with the G11 donors, as well
as to PARPA monitoring through support to the Poverty Observatory and the rolling P A F
matrix. Nonetheless, implementation o f the three multi-donor SWAPS(in agriculture,
education and health) has been mixed. Inhealth, the effort concentrated on strengthening
the policy focus and planning capacity o f the Government but did not achieve
harmonization of financing mechanisms; in education, the latter achievement came too
late (in January 2003) for IDA to participate, as i t s financing was by then already fully
committed. By contrast, PROAGRI achieved a high degree o f donor harmonization, but
implementation continues to be a large challenge, as IDA disbursements are below
expectations and results o n the ground remain limited.
Complex donor harmonization discussions have also sometimes delayed Bank
34.
work. Preparation o f the Public Sector Reform and Decentralized Planning projects was

64

delayed to allow sufficient time to build Government ownership o f the proposed reforms
and coordinate with other k e y stakeholders, including other donors. Approval o f the first
phase o f the Energy Reform APL was delayed to FY04, due to slow Government and
donor agreement to the sector policy and legal and institutional arrangements for the
project.

In addition, exogenous factors contributed to delayed implementation o f the Bank
35.
program. The 2000 flood emergency demanded an internal reallocation o f resources,
particularly in the roads and water sectors, to ensure timely reconstruction o f damaged
infrastructure. In addition, a change in Government composition following the December
1999 elections required a redefinition o f priorities in the dialogue, which in some cases
(e.g. higher education) also led to a stronger partnership.
Overall, the non-financing activities proposed under the June 2000 C A S were
36.
appropriate to attaining the C A S objectives. Important analytical and advisory activities
were completed, especially o n growth and public expenditure management, including a
two-volume PER, a C F A A and a CPAR; these are n o w the bedrock o f the new CAS.
Nevertheless, further w o r k remains to be done across important areas o f policy reform
and cross-sectoral advisory work, such as o n the labor market, rural development, and
environmental management, as highlighted under QAG’ s pilot assessment o f the Country
Team’s non-financing activities (see B o x 6 o f the CAS).

F.

Lessons Learned

37.

The following lessons have been learned from implementation o f the 2000 CAS:
0

0

Realism. Bank assessment o f implementation risks needs to b e more realistic.
Some cross-cutting constraints that had been identified under the previous C A S
were not appropriately addressed during the C A S period, and they became more
evident with time. In addition, institutional and capacity constraints were not
adequately considered in coordinating the pace o f reforms with program and
project implementation. During project preparation, the challenges o f
implementing complex activities need to b e more fully captured in the risk
assessment and mitigating activities need to b e devised and implemented.
Moreover, sufficient resources need to b e devoted to maintaining a dialogue o n
program and project design with project counterparts and ensuring an adequate
f l o w o f information o n project requirements.
Selectivity. The Bank continues to b e overextended in Mozambique and needs to
w o r k harder to be selective. The program under the June 2000 C A S proved to be
too ambitious, in terms o f b o t h the Government’s ability to implement a
multiplicity o f reforms and the Bank’s ability to finance needed technical and
advisory assistance as needed. Greater selectivity in the portfolio will help to
ensure adequate attention to project design and implementation under the new
CAS.
Monitoring results. Monitoring progress towards the PARPA targets was left to
the Government’s monitoring processes, which were implemented in partnership

65

with the donor community. As the CAS did not clearly identify expected C A S
outcomes or establish a formal monitoring system at the sectoral and project level
to track progress towards such outcomes, monitoring o f C A S implementation was
weak. I t has become evident that CAS outcomes and indicators should be
explicitly aligned with the PARPA’S medium-term outcomes and indicators.
This can be achieved through: (i)
a more adequate choice o f instruments to
increased focus o n analytical and
address the k e y cross-cutting constraints; (ii)
advisory activities in important areas that can ensure the pro-poor impact o f
Mozambique high levels o f growth; and (iii)
improved focus o n monitoring and
evaluation during portfolio implementation.
Dialogue and coordination. Strengthening the dialogue with all stakeholders
(including different levels o f government as w e l l as c i v i l society, the private
sector, and other development partners) i s necessary to reduce the transaction
costs o f interventions, both by reducing replication and by increasing ownership
o f the development program. Inparticular, the policy dialogue between the Bank
and the Government needs to be reinforced to ensure commitment around key
policy areas by the Ministry o f Planning and Finance as w e l l as the relevant sector
ministries. Advisory services and technical assistance can be used in this regard,
particularly in the areas o f public financial management and financial sector
reform.
Shifting the focus from inputs to results. During implementation o f the June 2000
CAS, the Government paved the way to important institutional reforms. At the
same time, with support from the Bank and other donors, the Government
gradually shifted its focus away from inputs and processes towards actual
developmental outcomes. This development i s uneven across sectors and need to
be supported further, particularly at the level o f the sectoral ministries.

66

Appendix 1 - Progress Made Towards the CAS Objectives
1.
Progress made towards achieving the C A S objectives, as specified in the June
2000 CAS, i s summarized in this Appendix, which reviews the k e y Bank activities as
organized under the three C A S pillars. Overall, the Bank has substantially completed
most activities and achieved most objectives set out in the CAS, with some exceptions.
(For a tabular summary o f planned and actual financing and non-financing activities, see
Appendix 2.)
I.

Increasing economic opportunities through private-sector-led growth

2.
The C A S aimed to support achievement o f the PARPA’s overall goals of:
reducing the poverty headcount index from 70% in 1997 to 60% by 2005 and 50% by
2010; achieving real growth o f 7% to 10% per annum (the minimum level o f growth
required for poverty reduction); maintaining annual inflation at 5% to 7% and a fiscal
deficit within limits established in the context o f the I M F ’ s PRGF arrangement; and
achieving a sustainable level o f external debt (through reaching the Enhanced H I P C
Initiative completion point).

3.
Progress has been good against the indicators. A s the PARPA Progress Report
notes, the PARPA targets for GDP growth and the domestic primary deficit were met,
though inflation was missed (mostly due to monetary expansion). With assistance from
the Bank and the Fund, Mozambique reached the Enhanced H I P C Initiative completion
point in September 2001, thus reducing i t s external debt to sustainable levels. In
addition, although the results o f the latest household survey will not b e available until late
2003 , partial and preliminary assessments indicate a sizable reduction in poverty.
4.
In helping the Government to achieve these outcomes, the Bank provided
substantial Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA) and technical assistance o n public
expenditure management, including a CEM, two PERs, a CFAA, and a CPAR; action i s
underway to implement the recommendations o f these reports. In addition, the Economic
Management and Private Sector Operation (EMPS0)-the Bank’s active adjustment
operation-is supporting an assessment o f B I M ’ s status (done); the preparation o f a
strategic legal sector reform plan (done); the introduction o f private participation into
LAM (advisors have been appointed); the inclusion in the budget o f off-budget revenues
and donor funding (largely done); the assessment o f banking sector compliance with
international prudential regulations (underway); an audit o f the state-owned insurance
company (underway); an actuarial analysis o f the national social security agency
(initiated); and preparation o f a more competitive telecommunications law (draft
submitted to the National Assembly).

5.
Technical assistance o n the banking sector (including a banking sector study, a
study o f Mozambique’s compliance with the Base1 Principles, and a joint Bank-Fund
Financial Sector Assessment), helped to deal with the crisis that emerged when Banco
Austral (BAu) and BCM encountered difficulties in 2000, though it did not succeed in
preventing high Government subventions to the sector and continued difficulties in BIM

67

(the successor to BCM). Moreover, despite a Financial Sector Capacity Building project
that closed in March 200 1, central bank ability to supervise the sector remains weak, and
the interest rate spread i s n o w near an all-time high o f 19%.

6.
Strengthening the private sector environment and thefinancial sector: Bank
AAA and technical assistance (including an Investment Climate Assessment,* support to
the Investment Promotion Center, and support to the annual Private Sector Conferences)
aimed to strengthen the business environment generally, and the Enterprise Development
project aimed to improve enterprise competitiveness-but these efforts have met with
m i x e d success. Joint w o r k by IDA, I F C and MIGA has attracted numerous large-scale
projects to Mozambique. Besides diversifying the export base, boosting tax revenues,
and advertising that Mozambique i s open for business, these projects have created
positive spin-off effects such as employee training, connected infrastructure
developments, and a growing number o f upstream and downstream linkages to SMEs
(though developing these linkages more fully remains a challenge).
7.
Outside the large-scale projects, Bank efforts to improve the regulatory and
administrative constraints o n businesses, help to diversify the economy and yield
additional investment, have had limited success. In manufacturing, successive WED
surveys (in 1998 and 2002) indicate that sales have stagnated (after a period o f rapid
growth in 1995 to 1997 which m a y have resulted from increased capacity utilization);
productivity levels remain highly variable; and growth remains concentrated in resourcebased extractive industries, in areas where there i s natural protection (such as beverages),
or in sectors enjoying trade preferences. Privatizations have placed some companies in
the hands o f individuals without the skill or experience needed to manage and grow their
businesses. M o s t local firms lag their regional competitors in skills levels, management
practices and manufacturing technique; and labor-intensive manufacturing such as
textiles, garments, and footwear, which have served many developing countries as export
platforms, have not been able to compete intemationally. Mozambican-owned SMEs are
struggling to survive; m u c h recent growth has come from large-scale projects that
generate little employments; and current sources o f growth, which depend heavily o n
natural resource extraction, m a y not b e sustainable in the long-term. Concerns remain
about the poverty impact and sustainability o f Mozambique’s recent growth and Bank
assistance has not helped, so far, to ease these concerns.
Developing infrastructure: The June 2000 C A S stressed the need to invest in k e y
8.
cross-cutting infrastructure such as energy and transportation to improve the business
climate, including through regulatory reforms enabling private sector participation.
Progress has been relatively good overall, though measurable results have been achieved
less rapidly than expected. A s the PAFVA Progress Report notes, in 2001-02, road
maintenance (supported by IDA’S$162 m i l l i o n Roads and Bridges credit) was running
behind schedule, due partly to the diversion o f resources to flood-related repairs and
partly to the fact that maintenance i s not based o n periodic surveys for estimating costs,
setting priorities, and scheduling; in 2001 less than 70% o f the overall target was
achieved, and for 2002 o n l y about 60% o f the target was projected to b e achieved. The
In the CAS, this ESW was called Constraints to Private Sector Development.

68

dialogue around reforms in the sector took longer than expected, delaying the
establishment o f a Road Fund independent o f the National Roads Administration (ANE)
and the creation o f a National Roads Council that would permit a separation o f functions
between allocation o f funds and execution o f works. By contrast, IDA’s Railway and
Port Restructuring project helped the Government to reach financial closure on the
concessioning o f the Maputo and Nacala rail-and-port-systems, bringing private partners
into these systems and laying the foundation for improved efficiency. In the power
sector, the Government i s trying to make EdM financially viable and to extend the grid
with IDA assistance, but (due to Government indecision regarding private participation in
EdM) the Energy Reform credit was approved too recently (in August 2003) to have had
a measurable impact o n costs and connectivity so far.
9.
IDA also helped to achieve progress in increasing access to safe water. In the five
cities where the Bank i s supporting private operation o f the water supply system through
the Second National Water Development credit, access has increased (by 20% in Beira
and 40% in Nampula) and 90% o f water samples now comply with Government
requirements; in addition, the tariff has increased steadily from $0.18 in 1995 to $0.40 in
2002, helping the operator to approach financial viability. Nonetheless, flood-related
setbacks in early 2000 and the withdrawal o f the original private operator meant that
extension o f the network lagged behind urbanization, with the result that the PARPA goal
o f 50% coverage by 2004 i s out o f reach.
10.
Progress has also been achieved in telecommunications and air transportation,
with support from IDA’s Communications Reform credit, an unplanned credit prepared at
the request o f a dynamic new Minister who saw an opportunity significantly to reduce
business transactions costs. With Bank assistance, a first draft o f a new
telecommunications law has been approved by Cabinet and submitted to Parliament (an
acceptable law i s a condition for releasing the second EMPSO tranche); a second mobile
communications license was issued to Vodacom South Africa in August 2002; T d M has
acquired corporate status and privatization advisers have been selected; and mCel (TdM’s
cellular arm) i s being established as a separate company to ensure that anti-competitive
cross-subsidization does not occur. In addition, in late 2002 two offers were received for
the Maputo airport concession and preparations were underway to restructure LAM, with
a view to increasing efficiency in air transportation.

11.
Promoting rural development and agriculture: Bank assistance to Mozambique’s
rural development has been made available through: project support to the Ministry o f
Agriculture (IDA i s one o f 18 donors to PROAGRI, the agriculture SWAP); numerous
infrastructure projects that have (and are intended to have) rural impacts; and I D N I F C
support to agribusiness. Results have been mixed. To date, PROAGRI has provided
MADER with vehicles, equipment, supplies, and technical assistance; irrigation systems
are being repaired; there has been progress o n decentralization (Provincial Directorates
prepare budgets, procure goods and services, and distribute funds to the districts, and
districts in turn prepare budgets and procure equipment and supplies); and some
extension and veterinary services are being outsourced to private providers, but the
impact o f these activities i s not known. While the Progress Report indicates that crop

69

production rose in 2001-02 (cereals by 5%, cashews and cotton by 12%, and sugar by
172%), it i s not clear that policy improvements or better services to farmers (and in
particular services provided under PROAGRI) explain these gains, which m a y reflect in
part a recovery from the 2000 floods.

12.
Bank support has helped to expand rural infrastructure. In particular, the First
National Water Development credit is helping to raise rural access to safe water close to
the PARPA goal o f 40% by 2005, as access rose sharply between 1998 and 2003. In
addition, the first phase o f the Roads and Bridges project i s connecting all provincial
capitals to the all-weather road network, enabling the second phase, n o w under
preparation, to shift the focus to secondary and tertiary roads. The Energy Reform
project i s also piloting some rural electricity alternatives with a view to identifying
potential for scale-up. Nonetheless, the benefits o f these activities for the rural
population, and in particular the poor, have been below expectations. Limited access to
markets and limited opportunities for off-farm incomes remain large concerns, despite the
work done to date, and the Bank has not been able to help Mozambicans to address
important issues, such as rural access to finance, improving agricultural standards and
agribusiness supply-chains, and ensuring the efficient diffusion o f yield-enhancing inputs
and technologies. This resulted in part because PROAGRI teething problems delayed the
start o f planned Government-Bank w o r k o n developing a rural development strategy
(now underway).

13.
Ensuring sound environmental management: Given Mozambique’s current
reliance o n extractive industries to grow as w e l l as the detrimental effect o f
environmental degradation o n health and income prosperity, the Bank has been working
with the Government to improve resource management. Using IDA credit and GEF grant
resources, the Bank i s supporting a Transfrontier Conservation Areas project ($5 m i l l i o n
GEF grant); a Coastal and Marine Biodiversity project ($5.6 m i l l i o n IDA credit and $4.1
m i l l i o n GEF grant); and a Mineral Resource Managementg project ($18 m i l l i o n IDA
credit). In 2001, the Government established the Ministry o f Tourism, which has drafted
a new tourism policy and law, based o n extensive consultations, designed to promote
conservation tourism that also benefits local communities.
II.

Improving governance and empowerment

14.
The June 2000 C A S aimed to support Government efforts to develop a public
administration that i s responsive to its constituents and that effectively supports the
country’s poverty-reduction efforts, where this was seen to involve reforming the public
sector and improving the rule o f law. IDA support to this area has been strong, and
progress has been substantial, although it will still take many years to achieve desired
outcomes.
15.
Reforming the public sector: T o promote decentralization, the Government i s
reviewing and reorganizing its structures with the support o f IDA’SPublic Sector Reform
project ($25.6 m i l l i o n IDA grant). The process involves a l l ministries in an exercise o f
In the CAS, this project was called the Natural Resources Management project.

70

mapping existing structures and analyzing functions and preparing restructuring plans;
currently, Education, Health, and Agriculture are o n track to initiate restructuring by
early 2004. Plans have also been developed to initiate decentralization in four central
provinces, with the support o f IDA’S Decentralized Planning and Financing project”
($42 m i l l i o n IDA grant): the m a i n goals are to promote participatory planning, build
capacity o f district governments and formalize their role in national planning while also
clarifying the rules for allocating resources to districts and increasing the share o f the
investment budget thus allocated. The project will start in 13 districts and gradually
expand to include as many as 49 districts within its scope. IDA i s also supporting
decentralization through the ongoing Municipal Development project ($33.6 m i l l i o n
credit), which i s focused o n improving the policy framework governing Mozambique’s
33 municipalities and developing the capacity o f selected municipalities, on a pilot basis,
to identify, appraise and implement small-scale urban infrastructure projects using grant
resources to “learn by doing”. In addition, all o f the infrastructure and natural resource
management investments mentioned in paragraphs 18 and 20 are helping to build
regulatory capacity in the relevant sectors. While results are not yet easily visible, the
processes underway are good processes which should yield visible results over time.
16.
Improving the rule of law: At the same time, the Bank has been helping the
Government to initiate overdue legal and judicial reform to raise the capacity, efficiency
and transparency of the legal system and increase i t s ability to respond to the needs o f the
private sector. Here progress has been less satisfactory. While the Ministry o f Justice
(MoJ), Administrative Court, Supreme Court, and Attorney General’s Office have
finalized an overall strategic plan and detailed operational plans, with implementation to
run to 2006l ‘-this was originally a H I P C completion point condition-progress has
been very slow. For example, a new Commercial Code has not yet been approved by the
parliament, and there i s n o consensus around the current draft. In addition, an anticorruption strategy, approved in October 2001, needs to be revised o n the basis o f a
public perceptions survey that the Bank i s n o w helping the Government to launch. F o r
these reasons, the Legal Reform component o f the planned Public Sector and Legal
Reform project was removed from the project presented to the Board in M a r c h 2003, to
be presented separately under the new CAS.

As noted above, the Bank has also been helping the Government t o modernize i t s
17.
public financial management system to increase transparency, improve controls, and
decentralize planning and execution, through AAA, technical assistance, and IDA’S
active adjustment operation, the Economic Management and Private Sector Operation
(EMPSO). Here there has been reasonable progress, though m u c h more remains to be
done. The Government has published quarterly budget execution reports since M a y
2000. A new public finance management l a w was passed in 2001 and its regulations in
2002. MPF has developed procedures for obtaining data o n donor disbursements, to be
presented as an annex to the budget execution report. A financial management

The Bank’s recent sector assessment highlighted a need to combat corruption in the judiciary and expand
judicial training and legal education; proposed reforms include decentralizing the justice system (by
establishmg courts in rural areas and intermediate-level appeal courts) as well as modernizing legislation

information system (SISTAFE) has been designed, together with a detailed plan for
introducing i t into spending authorities, and the system will also introduce detailed
functional and program classifiers into the budget. PERs were completed in October
2001 and June 2003 as joint Government-donor exercises (including the Bank), and a
series o f annual PERs i s planned for the coming years. Treasury accounts at the central
and commercial banks are being rationalized. Finally, a Country Procurement
Assessment Report i s nearing completion, and new procurement legislation i s being
drafted in light o f that report.

III.

Increasing human capabilities

18.
In aiming to increase human capabilities, the June 2000 C A S focused o n helping
to obtain relatively short-term improvements in health and educational status, and
accordingly the strategy focused o n H I V / A I D S prevention and control, extending access
to health care and educational services o f an acceptable quality, and ensuring social
protection. These goals were aligned with the PARPA’s social goals, w h i c h reflected the
l o w performance of Mozambique with respect to i t s neighbors. In health, the PARPA’s
main goals were identified as addressing geographical inequality in access to basic care,
improving the quality o f basic care, reducing the incidence o f malaria-related mortality,
and controlling the H I V / A I D S epidemic. In education, they were identified as increasing
enrollment and completion rates, particularly for girls, and reducing repetition rates. The
C A S reflected these priorities by aiming to strengthen the Government’s capacity to
allocate resources and reorient its efforts from inputs to services as w e l l as to improve
coordination with the other external partners active in these sectors t o improve aid
effectiveness and increase Government capacity for policy formulation and planning
around priorities.
Preventing and reducing the impact of HIV/AIDS: The PARPA incorporates the
19.
October 1999 national strategic plan to combat HIV/AIDS, which aims to slow the spread
o f infection and to mitigate its effects by targeting 2.3 m i l l i o n high-risk people with
preventive measures, and IDA’SH I V / A I D S project ($50 m i l l i o n IDA grant, approved in
March 2003) was intended to support implementation o f that plan. According to the
PARPA Progress Report, information campaigns were undertaken in 2001 and 2002; 24
voluntary testing and counseling offices have been opened since mid-2001; and the
PARPA target o f 24,000 tests for 2002 has been exceeded; at the same time, sectorspecific H I V / A I D S prevention and control programs are being prepared (e.g. in education
and transportation). E v e n so, progress remains slower than needed to significantly
mitigate the impact o f the epidemic in Mozambique.
Improving health: IDA has been supporting implementation o f the Government’s
20.
strategic health plan, w h i c h aims to expand and improve primary health care as w e l l as
combat malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy and HIV/AIDS, inter alia through its $98.7 m i l l i o n
Health credit. The Health SWAP that was planned in the previous C A S has not been and
will not be prepared, as future Bank assistance to the sector will b e channeled through the
PRSCs (an appropriate vehicle for financing recurrent expenditures) and related technical
and analytical assistance. K e y actions include improving sector planning and
management; building or expanding health centers; training basic health caregivers; and

72

ensuring that all health centers are equipped. The Progress Report indicates significant
health care improvements: attended births have risen from 28% in 1995 to 45% in 2002;
maternal mortality has fallen from 1,900 per 100,000 live births in 2000 to 1,600 in 2002;
infant mortality has fallen from 146 per 1,000 live births in the mid-1990s to 129 in 2001;
and vaccination coverage has risen from 55% in 1995 to 82% in 2001, but IDA’s
contribution cannot be easily disentangledfrom what has been a multi-donor effort. At
the same time, it i s clear that major challenges remain due to the impact o f HIV/AIDS
and shortcomings in expanding coverage (distances to clinics remain long and user fees
may exceed official rates).

21,
Improving education: In education, the PARPA Progress Report indicates that,
while school construction i s behind target, Government current expenditure on education
increased in real terms over 1999-2000 (from 2.9% o f GDP to 3.4%) and teacher training
exceeded targets. As a result, primary school efficiency improved; the number o f EP1
students (grades 1-5) increased by 5% in 2002; and girls enrollment in 2000 met the
PARPA target (44%), while further progress remains necessary to raise efficiency (it i s
h a l f that o f Zambia); train rural teachers; accelerate progress in EP2 (grades 6-7); and fill
a large funding gap. IDA has been a large contributor to the sector, through a $71 million
credit helping to fund school construction and teacher training at the EP level and a $50
m i l l i o n credit supporting tertiary institutions; IDA also helped to establish a common
funding mechanism using IDA procedures for the basic education program (though
IDA’s credit does not contribute as i t was fully committed before the pool became
operational (in January 2003)).

Annex 3
The PARPA and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)
1.
There i s broad alignment between the PARPA and MDGs. The PARPA includes
goals and benchmarks that are recognizably related to the MDGs, though they are not the
same. For example, the PARPA aims to reduce poverty from 70% in 1997 to 50% by
2010; raise primary school completion rates to 108% by 2005; eliminate gender disparity
in teacher training; reduce U 5 M R from 219 to below 200 by 2005; increase urban access
to safe water to 50% and rural access to 40% by 2005; reduce institutional MMR to
below 100 per 100,000 live births; prevent HIV/AIDS infections and reduce their impact;
and reduce malaria mortality in children by 15% in priority districts.
2.
But the PARPA also goes beyond the MDGs to include targets for
macroeconomic policy, disease, agriculture, public sector reform, employment, and so
forth. Specific MDG-related targets are in fact buried among some 90 quantitative
targets attached to 170+ actions included in the PARPA’s implementation matrix. Some
MDGs are poorly covered (gender and the environment) and quantitative targets are
sometimes missing. Moreover, while the MDGs have a strong focus o n outcomes,
PARPA targets tend to focus on outputs, processes and policy indicators.
3.
The first PARPA Progress Report, completed in February 2003, provided candid
insights into the difficulties involved in PARPA implementation and monitoring. I t
showed that implementation did not adequately focus o n the highest priorities, that sector
management and information flows need strengthening, and that data gaps make i t
difficult to judge progress. I t also showed that the health and education programs were
achieving results, that several key institutions are being strengthened, and that progress i s
being made in improving governance; by contrast, progress in improving agricultural
productivity remains elusive.

4.
The priority now i s to improve implementation monitoring and ensure adaptation
o f the strategy to incorporate the lessons learned. To this end, the PARPA i s being
integrated into national planning and a Poverty Observatory group has been created to
institutionalize stakeholder participation in monitoring, which i s currently based o n the
Government’s semi-annual social and economic planning report as well as quarterly
budget execution reports. The first meeting o f the Poverty Observatory took place in
April 2003. In preparing the Progress Report, the Government completed a detailed
matrix o f PARPA activities by sector, including a comparison o f targets and outcomes
over successive implementation periods. Preparation o f the matrix revealed the need to
monitor a more limited number of concrete and representative sectoral performance
indicators. The Bank and the group o f 11 donors supporting the Joint Programme for
Macro-Financial Support are now working together to increase the focus o f the
Government’s program, improve monitoring and evaluation, and strengthen the feedback
loop into Government decision-making.

F o r most indicators, Mozambique in the 1990s did not progress at a pace fast
enough to reach the MDGs; catch-up rates would need to be even higher from today
through 2015, but these rates are very unlikely to be achieved. In this context,
stakeholders need to temper ambition with realism, taking into account the unique
challenges that Mozambique faces, including in particular the H I V / A I D S pandemic,
which i s exerting upward pressure o n child and adult mortality rates.

With current policies and aid flows, the MDG targets that are likely to be met are
6.
those o n income poverty, hunger and primary enrolment. M a k i n g faster progress towards
the other MDG targets will require significant reforms and substantial additional
resources. Given Mozambique's high aid dependence (about 12% o f GDP in grants and
concessional loans), sustainability and absorptive capacity are significant limiting factors
at present. Limited managerial capacity in government ministries, limited domestic
entrepreneurial capacity, and in some sectors, policy and organizational difficulties that
would result in ineffective use o f increased concessional finance, point to serious limits
o n absorptive capacity in many sectors. A s a result, the effective use o f concessional
finance cannot rise swiftly in education, health, water supply, sanitation or agriculture,
though it could increase substantially and effectively in road rehabilitation, sewage and
drainage in the medium term (three to five years), provided that certain key policy
conditions are met. In aggregate, the estimated additional aid requirements would rise
from about $85 m i l l i o n to $225 m i l l i o n over the period 2004-2015 as absorptive capacity
increases and policy constraints are relaxed.
Lack o f reliable data for many MDG indicators makes i t difficult to assess the
7.
likelihood that Mozambique will achieve several MDG targets. In a scenario that
involves appropriate policy and institutional reform as w e l l as additional aid, it i s possible
that by 2015 the goals could also be met with regard to primary completion, H I V / A I D S
and access to water (see Figure below), though the gender equality target as w e l l as the
child and maternal mortality goals likely will not be met even in this scenario.

Annex 4
A Medium-Term Growth Strategy for Mozambique
1.
Growth prospects for Mozambique are bright, but the country faces many
challenges. As the FYOl C E M noted, high post-conflict growth has been due mainly to
four factors-increased political stability, generous external assistance, one-time
developments like population resettlement, and a first-generation o f economic reforms
that achieved macroeconomic stability. Sustaining growth at 7% per annum will require
maintaining political and macroeconomic stability, but even at that rate poverty would
not reduce rapidly. In fact, i t would take a century to raise per capita incomes to
Mexico’s level today. M o r e rapid growth will require a second generation o f reforms
designed to encourage popular participation, establish market-oriented policies creating
incentives for private accumulation, and orient public sector institutions to service
delivery complementing private initiative. Unlike the first generation o f reforms, which
could be achieved fairly easily by a few k e y government officials, these secondgeneration reforms will b e more difficult as they will require deeper institutional change,
broader consultations, and consequently longer periods o f gestation.

2.
F o r the next five to ten years, poverty reduction will depend o n rapid growth
sourced in improved agricultural productivity and expanded labor-intensive
manufacturing and services led by the private sector as w e l l as the redistribution o f public
spending towards sectors with the highest poverty-reducing potential, such as health,
education, water supply, and basic infrastructure. According to the FYOl CEM, which
remains pertinent today, this in turn depends o n decisive Government action in five areas:
3.

Strenathening the macroeconomic environment: Action i s needed in four areas.

(i)
Mozambique needs to continue reducing i t s fiscal deficit by increasing tax revenues,
I t needs to
through broadening the tax base and eliminating special incentives. (ii)
improve public expenditure management by improving public procurement, budget

execution, accounting and auditing; introducing an integrated financial management
information system (SISTAFE); consolidating the fiscal accounts; reviewing public
expenditures (both on- and off-budget) to assess and improve allocative efficiency; and
empowering elected municipalities to raise revenues and allocate spending according to
A s the recent banking crisis makes clear, i t also needs to reform and
local priorities. (iii)
strengthen the financial sector, by strengthening the supervision capacities o f the central
bank, raising the prudential framework to international standards, and improving
competition in the banking sector to reduce interest rates (in a 2003 investment climate
survey, 85% o f sampled firms reported that inadequate access to affordable finance was
the most binding constraint to growth). (iv) Finally, i t needs to strengthen i t s external
balance by raising manufacturing and cash crop exports back to pre-independence levels
and expanding the export base beyond the few products (mostly natural-resource based)
n o w included; actions could include more active promotion o f exports o f electricity, gas,
aluminum, agriculture, fisheries, tourism and manufacturing and the elimination o f legal
and administrative barriers to trade in combination with other actions designed to lower
the costs o f doing business.

86

Unleashinn awiculture 's poverty-reducinn potential: Agricultural growth, which
4.
i s expected to average 5% annually over the next few years, i s likely to be the single
largest contributor to poverty reduction in the medium term, but to realize i t s full
potential, Mozambique needs to focus o n three k e y actions. First, it needs to facilitate
rural trade by repairing roads, particularly in densely-populated Nampula and Zambezi,
and by abolishing trade licensing requirements. Second, it needs to improve the security
o f land tenure, as current inadequacies in land titling impede the use o f land as collateral
(thereby reducing access to credit); reduce allocative efficiency; and create bureaucratic
rigidities that provide rent-seeking opportunities. Allowing land-use rights to b e traded
with minimal bureaucratic interference w o u l d boost both smallholder production and
larger-scale businesses promoted by investors, including tourism operators. Third,
Mozambique needs to improve access to k e y agricultural inputs by reducing impediments
to seed, fertilizer and other k e y imports.
Removing the impediments to private sector nrowth: Transport, tourism, and
5,
labor-intensive manufacturing offer the greatest hope for poverty reduction over the next
20 years. Enclave megaprojects can play an important role, by generating foreign
exchange and tax revenues and providing opportunities for upstream and downstream
linkages, but they cannot be the main vehicle for development. Business activity among
small- and medium-sized enterprises needs to b e increased as well. The Bank Group has
been helping the Government to deploy a three-pronged strategy to promote privateremoving administrative barriers (in
sector-led growth, including in the short term: (i)
particular, simplifying business registration and other notarial requirements, increasing
labor flexibility, facilitating access to land, improving custom clearance procedures,
simplifying tax administration, and effecting commercial dispute resolution); (ii)
providing advisory services aiming to improve the productivity and competitiveness o f
selected export-oriented sectors (agriculture, tourism, textiles and footware), including
technical learning for f i r m s and support for developing backward and forward linkages to
increasing private-sector-participation and competition
existing and new buyers; and (iii)
in infrastructure, including particularly telecommunications, transport (ports, airports,
roads, railways and airlines), water supply and sewerage, gas and electricity, leading over
time to cheaper and higher-quality services. In the medium term, the Government needs
to implement a legal and judicial reform program aiming to update antiquated laws,
increase capacity, and curb corruption, thereby creating a more supportive business
environment, with improved access to the courts, reasonable levels o f contract
enforcement, and expanded protection o f property rights.

6.
Improvinn human capital: Improving health services, curtailing the spread o f
HIV and malaria, and improving education (particularly o f girls and women) are k e y to
Mozambique's continued social and economic development. The social returns to
education are especially likely t o be high, as literacy and numeracy will encourage the
1

Customs clearance s t i l l takes 18 days o n average; registration and other notarial services required o f small
businesses are both expensive and time-consuming; and labor l a w rigidities impose prohibitively high costs
both o n worker retrenchments and foreign hiring, impeding the abilities o f local firms to become or remain
competitive.

87

adoption o f more risky agricultural technologies, movement into more remunerative offfarm employment, and successful transitions into manufacturing. Female education has
especially high secondary impacts on nutrition, health status, and agricultural
productivity. But i t i s also important to lower HIV infection rates-as H I V / A I D S
decimates the w o r k force (including teachers and health workers), fractures and
impoverishes families, orphans millions o f children, and rips communities asunder.

7.
Protecting Mozam biaue ’s natural resources: Mozambique’s economy will
depend on natural resource extraction in the near term. Large perennial rivers offer
prospects for irrigating agriculture and developing hydroelectric power. Substantial gas
and coal reserves have been found, and prospecting continues for petroleum and mining.
Large investments exploiting the transportation corridors or exporting energy (gas, coal
or electricity) are under active consideration by large international companies, although
the Maputo I r o n and Steel Plant will not proceed, following the collapse o f Enron (its key
sponsor). T o maximize Mozambique’s long-term returns from this growth source i t will
need to undertake environmentally and socially sustainable development, by
strengthening its environmental institutions and ensuring that largely-untested policy
frameworks yield effective policies that both promote growth and protect the
environment. In this area, five matters require special attention: resource usage rights,
fisheries, forest management, artisanal mining, and water resource management.
Wildlife-based tourism developments also have potential, as Mozambique’s 2,700 km
coastal zone has numerous unique habitats. Tourism potential, particularly as an add-on
destination for affluent travelers to South Africa, i s large but mostly untapped, though a
large increase in the number o f luxury hotels in tourist locations (despite l o w occupancy
rates o f about 60% currently) i s evidence o f the private sector’s confidence in the
country’s ability to attract tourists.
8.
All o f the reforms proposed above would help to create an environment that
encourages businesses to expand and undertake new activities and small-scale farmers to
go beyond subsistence agriculture to the production and marketing o f surpluses, thus
allowing the country to maintain its rapid growth. Some o f these reforms are
controversial; some go against powerful vested interests; and some will entail costs
before they yield benefits. Over time, though, they will make an increasing number o f
Mozambicans more prosperous. The Government and its partners are already actively
pursuing many of the actions outlined above; most are reflected in the PARPA and
supported in the Bank’s current C A S as w e l l as this new CAS.

Private Sector Development Strategy'

I.

Introduction

The financial, human and technical capacity needed to achieve economic growth
1.
sufficient to lift 20% o f Mozambicans out o f poverty i s not likely be obtained from
existing state or donor resources; the private sector will need to b e an important, if not the
main, contributor. Generating a private sector-led growth strategy poses considerable
challenges and will take time and significant resources. The challenges t o b e addressed
during this C A S period include: addressing inadequacies o f the financial system,
alleviating constraints in the business environment, and improving efficiencies in
infrastructure services.

11.

Main Characteristics o f the Private Sector and Historical Development

2.
T w o decades o f c i v i l war, fifteen years o f a centrally-planned economy, and
several natural disasters in recent years have impacted the structure o f the domestic
private sector, which -being at an early stage o f industrialization - i s still fragmented,
small in size, and characterized by a lack o f competitiveness. While the domestic private
sector continues to transition between the centrally planned and a market-driven
economy, i t faces an array o f administrative and other barriers, which constrain i t s
progress. Mozambican enterprises are also lagging behind their regional competitors
with regard to manufacturing techniques, management techniques and practices, and the
level o f acquired basic and advanced technical and non-technical skills: the competitive
advantage derived from low-cost labor i s offset by l o w skill levels.
3.
Based o n preliminary figures from the National Statistics Institute, the formal
private sector i s comprised o f 27,800 enterprises, which contributed to the economy with
a turn over o f 60,531,837,0003 meticais in 2001 and provide employment to 274,275
people. The vast majority o f these firms are micro enterprises, which employ 10 or fewer
staff, and Maputo is host to the largest percentage o f these firms. (As N S I data do not
include the informal sector, they obviously under represent private-sector contributions
to the economy.) Formal private-sector enterprises fall into t w o distinct types. First, a
few large, foreign-owned, export-oriented, capital-intensive megaprojects have
contributed significantly to maintaining high growth rates and exports levels. These
include Mozal, a $2.2 b i l l i o n investment, and the Sasol-sponsored Pande gas fields and
pipeline development, with initial investments totaling $1.1 billion. Also under
consideration are a Corridor Sands Titanium Dioxide project and the Moatize
Coal/Zambezi Valley Transport Corridor project. Second, the formal private sector
includes hundreds o f micro- and small-scaled enterprises w h i c h are mostly Mozambicanowned, sell to the local market, face severely constrained resources, and contribute
modestly to growth and exports. Unfortunately, these two groups o f enterprises are not
integrated; while backward and forward linkages have started to increase (from a very

' This Annex was prepared by Gilbert0 de Barros.
89

l o w base), few f i r m s use inputs from other Mozambican firms in their o w n production
processes. That said, megaprojects have helped Mozambique to establish itself as an
attractive destination for foreign direct investment (FDI), while also contributing to
developing the sales revenues o f some local firms, whose productivity and quality
standards have been increased significantly through megaproj ect linkages.
A s noted in the recently-completed Investment Climate Assessment, projected
4.
megaproject investments total about $ 10 billion, or twice current GDP, yet, given their
capital-intensive nature, they are likely to generate only about 20,000 jobs (5,000 within
the companies involved and 15,000 among suppliers and services providers), representing
less than 1 percent o f the 3.7 m i l l i o n new workers projected to enter the j o b market
between n o w and 2010. Though the indirect and induced effect o f these projects, if
properly managed, could have a positive contribution beyond their contribution to the
GDP, from a longer-run perspective private sector-led growth in Mozambique will call
for the more rapid development o f local enterprises and the S M E sector.

5.
Challenges ahead: Generating broad-based growth led by the private sector
requires increased trade and investment integration with regional and international
markets to b e able to capitalize o n Mozambique’s comparative advantages. Export
markets, regional as w e l l as international, are critical to Mozambique’s future prosperity,
as consumer disposable income in Mozambique i s very low. But Mozambique’s overall
business environment, rather than helping businesses to be competitive in these markets,
contributes to high cost structures that make them uncompetitive. On average, it takes
138 days to register and start operating a company in Mozambique (compared, e.g., to 14
days in China); it can s t i l l take up to 18 days to clear imports and 2 1 days to clear exports
across the border; labor productivity remains very low? and judicial dispute resolution i s
extremely inefficient (it can take as much as six times longer than in South Africa or
Botswana). In addition, public officials continue to operate in a bureaucratic and
sometimes rent-seeking manner that does not facilitate but impedes business.
6.
Access to capital i s also a k e y issue. Mozambican enterprises are severely
capital-constrained; most rely o n their o w n resources to meet their investment and
working capital requirements, limiting their ability to invest in technology and skills
development and therefore limiting their productivity. Cumbersome application
procedures, the short-term duration o f most available credit, and stringent collateral
requirements (required collateral averages 140% o f the credit amount, and land-use rights
cannot be monetized) are all part o f the problem. An efficient financial sector i s urgently
needed, but in Mozambique, the restructuring o f the financial sector remains incomplete,
Skilled labor i s scarce and expensive in Mozambique (impeding the ability o f local f i r m s to build up
required technical and managerial slulls locally), and even unslulledlabor i s relatively expensive (despite
l o w wage levels-average unskilled workers earn about $43 a month for work that pays about $87 a month
in Nigeria-skills levels are so l o w that they f i l l y offset apparent savings). In addition, the labor l a w
impedes the recruitment o f expatriate skilled labor and imposes high costs o n retrenchments when a
business slows down or adopts labor-saving techniques (45% o f surveyed fm recently claimed that they
chose to retain excess workers rather than pay high statutorily-required indemnities). Labor regulations and
inspections are not only a constant source o f irritation for many fm, but the situation has seen little
improvement since 1998, when previous surveys were completed.

90

local capital markets lack depth, and the high cost o f borrowing continues to impose a
drag o n firms’ ability to expand and increase productivity.
M o r e than 850 state-owned enterprises have been privatized in the last decade, yet
7.
divestiture i s incomplete and the expected additional contribution o f these privatized
entities to investment, domestic product, and employment has not yet fully materialized.
Some privatized assets were not allocated to their best use, possibly contributing to a
reluctance to implement the next generation o f divestitures and delaying completion o f
private participation in the delivery o f infrastructure services, In addition, some
privatizations (e.g. in telecommunication and air transportation) are being undertaken
with a depressed international investment climate.

Performance under the Previous CAS

8.
Overview of economic growth and development: Mozambique has successfully
attracted FDI in megaprojects that have catalyzed economic activity and fueled growth.
Over the last four years, megaprojects have raised export levels to an unprecedented $1
billion in 2002. But since 1997 export growth outside the megaprojects has been very
limited, largely because the overall (non-megaproj ect) economy has remained noncompetitive. O f particular concern i s the local private sector, which has been too weak to
take advantage o f opportunities in the domestic market and continues to have a narrow
range and quality o f services and products. Owing to economic inefficiencies, prices in
Mozambique tend to be very high in comparison with South A h c a , for e ~ a m p l e . ~

9.

Under the previous CAS, there was progress in creating an enabling environment
for private participation in infrastructure through liberalizing regulations in several
sectors, including communications and air and maritime transportation and through
introducing private partners into water supply, ports, and railways. In addition, there has
been progress in reducing r e d tape impacting o n the cost o f doing business in
Mozambique, though m u c h more w o r k needs to b e done in all o f these areas.

IV.

The Government’s Private Sector Development Strategy

The PARPA identifies the private sector as the m a i n engine for economic
10.
development and notes that private sector development depends critically o n suitable
infrastructure services. In this context, the Government has taken steps to improve
critical cross-cutting infrastructure, through for example opening b o t h fixed and mobile
telecommunications to competition and increasing private sector participation in air
transportation and urban water supply. The adoption o f Decree 30/21 o f October 15,
2001, which requires public institutions to respond to private-sector requests within a
determined number o f days, i s also a business-friendly development. The success o f the
megaproj ects has also demonstrated that the Government can create and maintain a
business-friendly environment. I t i s important n o w to ensure that that environment
extends not only to the megaprojects and other businesses that are able to resolve their
According to the Financial M a i l (December 6,2002), tax receipts at the Komatipoort border indicate that
Mozambicans spend $30 m i l l i o n a month in Nelspruit, a small South African t o w n just over the border.

SMEs are mostlyAikely to lead to long-term growth and j o b creation. To this end, the
Government recognizes that system-wide action i s required to remove remaining

business; (ii)
adopting a new Commercial Code that fosters private sector development;
(iii)
reducing labor market rigidities; (iv) clarifying property and land use rights; (v)
improving the trade regime; and (vi) implementing legal and judicial sector reform.
I t i s worth noting that improving the business environment through private sector
11.
development i s j u s t one element o f a broader program o f reforms, which also includes
Government focus on selected sectors that are believed to be especially competitive:
Tourism: In2001, the Government established the Ministry o f Tourism (MITUR) to
help develop this high-potential sector. Since then, a tourism policy and draft tourism
law have been prepared. M I T U R i s now developing an integrated Program for
Sustainable Tourism and Conservation (PROTUSC); a key element o f the emerging
strategy involves establishing Priority Areas for Tourism development (PATIs) as a
basis for spatial planning at the provincial and district levels and continuing to
develop the Transfrontier Conservation Areas (TFCAs), which seek to combine
conservation and development objectives. A tourism fund (FUTUR) will be used to
promote Mozambique as a desirable tourism destination for the local, region and
international markets. MITUR also hopes to contribute to the development o f the
South East Africa Tourism Investment Program (SEATIP), which aims to develop
tourism and conservation areas linking Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, South
Africa, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
Agriculture: Recognizing the growth potential o f agriculture and agribusiness, the
Government’s Agricultural Policy and Strategy for Implementation aims at
“transforming subsistence agriculture and linking i t more closely to production,
marketing and processing activities, and increasing marketed surpluses, while
developing an efficient commercial sector”. Mozambique has the potential to provide
competitive products for selected crops to regional and international export markets,
but gaining access to these markets will require adopting modem farming techniques
and high quality standards along the entire supply chain. T o this end, MADER i s
developing an institutional structure to provide more cost-effective delivery o f a core
set o f agriculture and natural resources related services.
Fisheries: In2002, fisheries contributed $92 m i l l i o n in export revenues, making it
the leading export sector after aluminum. The Government strategy for the sector
aims to strengthen the supply chain (production, transportation, marketing and
processing activities) and ensure sustainability through aquaculture development.
The private sector will be the main driver for improving the quality and quantity o f
fish products; the public sector will limit i t s role to ensuring that fishing does not
exceed maximum sustainable yield and contributes to integrating rural fishing
communities into the national economy. Achieving these objectives will involve: (i)
developing artisanal and industrial fishing, including through adopting modern
fishing techniques and high quality standards along the supply chain; (ii)
developing
aquaculture to initiate structural changes that contribute to long-term sustainability;

92

and (iii)
acquiring capacity and equipment for adequate surveillance o f the waters
within Mozambique’s economic exclusivity zone.
Mining: Geological studies indicate occurrences o f heavy mineral sands all along
Mozambique’s 2,500 km coast. T o exploit this potential, the Government i s
concessioning mining areas to the private sector and also developing mechanisms to
increase revenues and improve quality-of-life in areas where there i s a strong
concentration o f artisanal miners. T o this end, the Ministry o f Energy and Minerals
will revise the legal framework, focusing o n the terms and conditions for exploitation,
surface rental fees, validity periods for exploration licenses, and standard mining
agreements. The Ministry i s also building its capacity to enforce laws and
regulations, administer mining titles, monitor the development o f small-scale mining,
and manage Mozambique’s mining assets. Developments such as the proposed
titanium sands projects are expected to resuk4

12.
Infrastructure reforms: The Government also intends to increase private sector
participation in infrastructure to improve access and quality. This will require revising
and upgrading the existing regulatory framework to create a level playing field in several
sectors (telecommunications, air transportation, railways, ports, energy, and water) to
make them more attractive to private investors. The current framework lacks clarity in
many areas, such as competitive market structures, enforcement o f regulatory
arrangements, public-service obligations, and financing. Moreover, issues such as the
delineation o f responsibilities for regulation, supervision and operations-all functions
that were, until recently, performed defacto by the public utilities and enterprises
themselves (e.g., TeZecomunicaqGes de Moqambique in telecommunication and
Electricidade de Moqambique in energy) will need to unbundled. Progress has been
made in water and telecommunication in establishing regulatory agencies, but some
sectors still require comprehensive analysis and definition o f necessary regulations to
address these issues. In addition, with regulatory institutions required for water,
electricity, telecommunications, and c i v i l aviation, institutional settings will need to be
harmonized, refocused and coordinated in order to achieve economies o f scale, improve
their efficiency, and ensure their consistency and long-term sustainability.

13,
Support to SMEs: The Ministry o f Trade and Industry (MIC) will help to nurture
SMEs by helping to address some o f the constraints facing SMEs. These include the lack
o f access to: (i)
capital; (ii)
skilled labor, including in management; (iii)
modem
technologies; and (iv) modem management methods and techniques. The Government
aims to help improve access to finance by addressing the long-term causes o f the lack o f
affordable credit. Firms and financial and non-financial intermediaries located in
Mozambique will be provided with assistance in order to build their technical capacities.
An Irish company, Kenmare Resources, has been granted a concession to extract, process and distribute
the minerals f r o m mines in M o m , Nampula, where heavy sands contain world-class deposits o f titanium; it
has been estimated that the mines will produce 612,000 tons o f ilmenite, 24,000 tons o f zircon and 12,500
tons o f rutile per year. A similar project i s planned for Chibuto, some 200 km north o f Maputo; this project
i s being developed by Australia’s W M C Resources and South Africa’s Industrial Development Corporation
(IDC), which recently acquired a 10% stake in Corridor Sands.
41

93

In addition, the Government will help to reduce or removing the numerous administrative
barriers that constrain enterprises’ development: reducing the time and cost o f registering
a business will be an important outcome o n this agenda.

V.

The World Bank Group’s Private Sector Development Strategy

14.
In supporting the Government’s growth strategy, the Bank Group will focus on:
(i)
improving the investment climate; (ii)
reforming the financial sector; (iii)
supporting
improved infrastructure through increased private-sector participation; and (iv) providing

integrated support to develop strategic entry points. This strategy will involve analysis,
knowledge dissemination, financing, and selected implementation support. This
assistance assumes that growth will come from several entry points: (i)
natural-resourcetourism; (iii)
based megaprojects (including enterprises linked to the mega projects); (ii)
agriculture and agribusiness; (iv) export-oriented manufacturing in labor-intensive
activities, particularly in textiles, garments, and footwear; and (v) SMEs.
The Group’s comparative advantages include the ability to undertake analytical
15.
work that i s informed by i t s global experience in developing countries, allowing i t to
provide relevant technical and policy advice, combined with focused lending, where
grant financing i s not available. IFC has the ability to mobilize and provide financing to
the private sector coupled with the necessary expertise in terms o f project preparation and
implementation. MIGA will fully complement the work o f IDA and IFC by providing
political risk insurance coverage for foreign private investors w h o are doing business in
Mozambique. Moreover, MIGA will continue to provide technical assistance to the
Center for Investment Promotion, which i s already taking place in close collaboration
with the W o r l d Bank under the Enterprise Development Project.

16.
The B a n k Group will support the enterprise development by improving
productivity and broadening the base for growth. This will involve a two-track approach.
First, matching grants w o u l d be provided to domestic enterprises and intermediaries to
develop their technical and managerial skills in a manner that will also build the capacity
o f domestic business development services (BDS) providers. Second, partnership and
linkages to FDI w o u l d b e strengthened. This support, which will f o r m an integral part of
IFC’s strategy for Mozambique, w o u l d target the development o f firms, products, and
sectors that have demonstrated potential for export and competitiveness, including f i r m s
in manufacturing, tourism, agro-industry and fisheries. In addition, MIGA will work
with IDA and LFC to support S M E development, including under the Enterprise
Development Project (PoDE). Promotion o f foreign investments related to SMEs i s one
o f M I G A ’ s priority areas, and in this context MIGA will promote use o f its e-mail-based
investor outreach service, FDI Xchange, to bring together entrepreneurs and project
developers in developing countries with potential partners, technology, and capital
worldwide.
Firms and individuals that sign up for the free service will receive periodic e-mail updates containing new
investment information, customized according to their region, sector or topic o f interest. The FDI Xchange
will also allow SMEs in Mozambique to spread the word to potential partners worldwide regarding their
particular product or market opportunity, using the CPI as a conduit.

Helping to improve the investment climate

17.
To sustain high growth rates and broaden private-sector participation, the
Government i s committed to improving the overall investment climate. Although most
o f the constraints to private sector development were identified several years ago,
progress in removing them has been slower than expected, due partly to lack o f a process
for following-up o n agreements and partly to lack o f adequate prioritization. In light o f
the recently-completed Investment Climate Assessment, the Bank will step up efforts to
tackle the k e y administrative barriers in a sustained manner, in the following areas:
0

B.

Institutional capacity for private sector development: Bank assistance will aim to
enhance the capabilities o f public and private institutions to deliver business support
services as w e l l as support public agencies in transitioning from maintaining control
functions to providing business facilitation and promotion services. The PoDE
project, with IDA and MIGA support, i s k e y to this effort.
Private-public dialogue: Bank assistance will help to focus private-public dialogue
o n removing the constraints to private sector development, regarding (i)
the time and
cost involved in registering a business; (ii)
labor l a w rigidities, concerning especially
adoption
short-term and expatriate hires and mandated redundancy indemnities; (iii)
o f a new commercial code; and (iv) the marketability o f property and land use rights.
The B a n k will help the Confederation o f Business Associations (CTA) to help
improve the business environment through consultancy services, studies, and a
training program aiming to build the institution’s capacity. This support will also
help b o t h MIC and MITUR to become more effective in developing and delivering
business facilitation.
Exportpromotion: Institutional capacity-building will b e coupled with analysis to
improve understanding o f the products and sectors in which Mozambique i s or could
be competitive. Since competitiveness i s k e y to maintaining high growth, i t will need
to be strengthened through developing the ability o f firms to export and generate
linkages within the domestic economy. The Bank will also support CPI’s efforts to
develop and implement a three-year strategic plan building o n its o w n transformation
from a regulator to a facilitator and promoter o f FDI by broadening its appeal to
foreign investors engaged in labor-intensive employment-creating activities and
focusing CPI’s efforts o n the most promising export-oriented sectors and products.
Export processing zones (EPZs): While the enabling environment for private sector
participation i s being improved, the Bank will also help to attract labor-intensive
manufacturing based in the EPZs that build o n the transport development corridors.
Limited investments in the development o f EPZ infrastructure to “jump start” their
establishment outside Maputo will b e considered t o help broaden the manufacturing
and processing industries.
Furthering reform of thefinancial sector

Financial sector reform will be needed to help improve the lending environment,
18.
decrease banking system vulnerabilities, increase competition, reduce the high cost o f

95

capital, and improve the oversight capacity o f Banco de Moqambique (the central bank).
Advice o n these and other activities i s being provided through a joint Bank-Fund
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP). Specific assistance arising out o f this
diagnosis i s expected to address the issue o f non-performing loans, which i s still severely
affecting banking sector performance. The main focus o f reform i s likely to include:
strengthening banking supervision, enhancing the scope o f financial intermediation,
monetary and public debt management, and the capital market and microfinance industry:
Strengthening banking supervision: Supervision has improved since the last
assessment o f the Base1 Core Principles, but significant work remains to b e done: (i)
the Banking Supervision Department needs to establish regular communication with
the head offices o f foreign-owned banks and the banking supervisors in their
the loan classification and loan loss provisioning systems
countries o f domicile; (ii)
trigger points need to be
need to b e brought into l i n e with international practices; (iii)
established to prompt legal action once a bank’s capital falls below the minimum
requirements; and (iv) clear steps need to b e taken to build the core knowledge o f
supervision staff, especially to ensure their capacity independently to validate
information received from financial institutions. In addition, i t i s important to
improve market oversight through the adoption o f international accounting standards
(IAS) for all banks.
Enhancing the scope offirzancial intermediation: To stimulate commercial banks to
make sound new credits, several short and longer-term actions would need to be
possibly establishing a commercial court, dealing with the
undertaken, including: (i)
adopting a new Commercial Code, together with a revised Code o f
largest cases; (ii)
Civil Procedure (no attempts have been made thusfar to revise the 1967 Code o f C i v i l
simplifying judicial procedure (procedural complexity i s very high in
Procedure); (iii)
Mozambique as compared to neighboring countries); (iv) enhancing the scope and
reliability o f the credit registry administered by the central bank; (v) training judges
in commercial dispute resolution; and (vi) reforming the land-registry and
establishing a registry for movable property. To that end, the Government would
need to seek advice o n the design and practice o f commercial courts; revision o f the
commercial code and c i v i l procedures; and the establishment o f monitoring processes
to identify progress in achieving designated outcomes.
Monetary andpublic debt management: Although a tighter monetary policy in mid2001 appears to have stabilized prices and the exchange rate, i t also contributed to
higher and more volatile interest rates. T o reduce volatility (of both prices and
interest rates) and enhance the scope for local currency intermediation, thereby
limiting financial dollarization, the central bank needs to adopt a more transparent
pro-active approach to monetary management. This involves strengthening the
monetary framework, which currently lacks transparency. Market participants at
present do not fully understand the goals or procedures o f monetary policy, partly
because the central bank has failed to explain its goals and operating procedures and
partly because the design and operation o f its monetary instruments i s flawed,
sending conflicting signals o n the Government’s stance o n monetary policy. Acting
preemptively to limit deviations f r o m monetary policy objectives will also require a
strengthening o f the central banks’s analytical capacity and greater emphasis o n

96

0

C.

inflation targets. At the same time, it i s important to rely more closely on an
intermediate monetary target. To enhance transparency and avoid interfering with
market signals, the central bank may need to conduct i t s monetary operations in the
overnight money market.
Capital market: Mozambique’s small capital market offers limited scope for
development in the short term. At this stage, the first aim should be to develop the
market for public securities, thereby providing a market-driven benchmark for the
issuance o f private securities. Beyond this, there i s scope for the local listing and
trading o f securities w i t h sufficient disclosure, but without overburdening the process,
favoring as much as possible regional integration and economies o f scale. In this
context, current capital controls will need to be reviewed to ensure that they do not
unduly restrict regional integration and regional capital movements.
Microfnance industry: Although the microfinance industry has grown rapidly in
recent years, i t still has a very small outreach, with a high concentration in Maputo.
Prospects for i t s development are good, and several well-performing microfinance
institutions (MFIs) are already in partnership with well-regarded international
microfinance service providers. Even so, important bottlenecks need to be
eliminated, including restrictions o n deposit taking (that limit the size and usefulness
o f the MFIs) and lack of human resources (that increase the cost o f intermediating).
Legislation currently under preparation would benefit from expert advice and should
allow MFIs to take deposits. I t would also be useful if Mozambican MFIs
strengthened their cooperation with well-known international NGOs or financial
cooperative networks that have been effective in developing good-practice MFIs by
drawing on existing informal practices.

Provision o f infrastructure services

19.
Bank assistance under the CAS will aim to increase private-sector participation
and competition in the provision o f infrastructure services, including in power, transport,
telecommunications, water supply and sewerage. For private sector participation to be
augmented, there are a number o f regulatory issues that have to be addressed:
Unbundling of policy, regulation and operation : Traditionally, a close relationship
between government departments and state-owned enterprises has meant that policymaking, regulation and operations have been embodied in a single institutional
process. These functions need to be unbundled and clarified, so as to: (i)
design and
implement regulations and competition policies in utilities and economic sectors
(including power, transport, communications, and water); (ii)
establish, strengthen
and harmonize the regulatory and supervisory bodies in these sectors; and (iii)
train
regulatory staff and provide outside experts to advise in regulation. Increasing
private participation in infrastructure will need to be done with adequate policy
sequencing, so that the legal regulatory framework conducive to privatization i s in
place and a level playing field i s established.
Increasedprivate-sector participation in infrastructure (PPI): The Bank’s
assistance will be delivered through several IDA projects (including the Energy
Reform project, Communications project, the Second National Water Development

97

project, and the Railways and Ports Restructuring project) as w e l l as through I F C
investments and MIGA guarantees. The emphasis will b e o n establishing a new
business model for infrastructure service delivery which aims to contribute to the
M D G s and i s characterized by public-private partnerships. Enhanced IDA, I F C and
MIGA integration will help not only to establish the PPI enabling environment but
also to give comfort to and so crowd in potential private-sector investors (e.g. through
structuring and financing innovative mechanisms for the private delivery o f publiclyfunded services, especially to the poor.)
Coordination within the World Bank Group: While IDA will support upstream
w o r k o n sector policy, strategy and design o f the transactions, I F C will mobilize
sponsors and provide investors with access to financing and MIGA will seek
opportunities to provide political risk coverage, as appropriate. This coordinated
approach i s already helping to unlock development potential in the Zambezi valley,
where IDA and IFC are advising the Government o n awarding concessions for the
coal deposits at Moatize, rehabilitation o f the Sena railway (which IDA will also help
to finance), and modernization o f the Beira port.
Transparent funding mechanisms: Adopting market-based solutions to the delivery
o f infrastructure services raises the issue o f affordability o f those services for lowincome segments o f the population, especially in areas where there i s a l o w
population density. Among other approaches, output based aid (OBA) could be used
to enable private participation while improving the access and affordability o f
services for the poor? funding o f these subsidies could be provided by the
Government or the international community. Whatever financing mechanism i s
adopted, innovative cost recovery schemes will need to b e in place to develop
replicable and sustainable infrastructure services to the poor. In light o f
Mozambique’s fiscal constraints, direct cost recovery mechanisms are also needed to
complement or replace subsidization schemes; subsidies w o u l d b e targeted and could
b e used for both connections and user charges, as appropriate.

D.

Strategic Entry Points for the World Bank Group

20.
Entry points for the Group will focus o n natural resources, tourism, agriculture
and agribusiness, and the development o f SMEs. These are the sectors with the greatest
growth potential, where the Bank Group will address constraints to development with a
integrated approach:
2 1.
Natural-resource-based mega-projects: The Bank Group has supported the
development o f megaproj ects within Mozambique, with the objective o f maximizing
their economic contribution and development impact. To help develop the Pande and
Temane gas fields, processing plant and pipeline, IDA has supported preparatory work
aiming to identify the most promising alternative uses o f the gas and to structuring the
resulting concession; in addition, IBRD i s providing a partial risk guarantee to project
lenders and F C i s participating in the equity. Similarly, IDA and IFC are helping the
Government to evaluate and structure the complex Moatize coal and Zambezi valley
OBA differs f r o m traditional public subsidies, w h i c h are typically directed at inputs for service delivery,
by linking the subsidy t o achieving a specific output (e.g. number o f consumers connected per year).

98

transport corridor developments; the objective o f this early involvement i s to ensure that
ensuing private-sector investments yield the maximum economic and social benefits. I F C
i s also involved in early discussions o n the Corridor Sands project.

22.
Tourism: The Bank Group aims to help implement PROTUSC, in cooperation
with other development partners; this will involve supporting policy and regulatory
reform, institutional strengthening at the national and provincial levels, the work o f the
provincial tourism facilitation commissions, and spatial planning at the provincial and
district level. The program would also include strengthening capacity in environmental
and social assessment as well as support to regional and district planning authorities, such
as the Elephant Coast Development Agency for Matatuine District and planning
authorities that may be created for other PATIs. In addition, support would continue for
the T F C A initiative to help Mozambique to improve management o f i t s natural assets,
w i t h a strong emphasis placed on protecting the rights o f communities inside and outside
o f core-protected areas and developing community/private-sectorjoint venture options.
This program will also include renewed emphasis on identifying biodiversity hot-spots as
a basis for more consistent planning and management.
T o promote regional integration o f tourism, I F C in collaboration with IDA will
23.
analyze regional tourism opportunities involving Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland
and Zimbabwe. This analysis will help to identify key constraints, options for addressing
them, and promising investment opportunities involving private investors. The Bank
Group will also support the South East Africa Tourism Investment Program (SEATIP),
which aims to help communities to participate as full partners in the T F C A process while
also providing an enabling framework for the private sector to invest. Assistance will
aim to solidify community rights through the creation o f trusts, concessions or other
equity structures, and would help create incentives and frameworks for the private sector
and communities to develop joint ventures based o n management plans, including access
to concessionary loans or small grants. Funding will be needed for land demarcation,
community funds and institutional support at the provincial and national levels. Basic
infrastructure (e.g. roads, park facilities) may also be provided for the core terrestrial and
marine protected areas in the TFCAs and PATIs, with support provided for multi-sectoral
tourism infrastructure planning. A key part o f the process will be developing Strategic
Environmental Assessments for investments: strict environmental and social criteria
would be applied to any project financed through this mechanism, and environmental
management programs would be designed to monitor and implement environmental
mitigation processes.

24.
Agriculture and agribusiness: IDA assistance in this area i s meant to improve
the impact o f public expenditures o n developing a positive enabling environment for
sustainable and equitable growth in the rural sector, consistent with the reduction o f
poverty and improvement o f food security, while ensuring the protection o f the physical
and social environment. The first (five-year) phase o f PROAGRI, which i s now nearing
completion, aimed to establish an institutional structure able to provide cost-effective
delivery o f a core set of agriculture and natural-resources related services. I t i s now
necessary to build the technical and managerial capacities o f export orient agro-

99

businesses, inter alia through PoDE and, as I F C i s n o w doing, through developing a
strategy to support crops with high export potential, involving regional and global
private-sector partners. Progress would be assessed by the extent to which agricultural
input and output markets increase in competition and volume, as evidenced by number o f
traders; narrowing o f the gap between farmer prices and prevailing local markets prices;
increases in agricultural production and productivity; increases in the contribution o f
marketed produce to household income for small-holder subsistence farmers working
with irrigation schemes; and hectares under sustainable irrigation systems. Progress will
also b e measured in terms o f ago-processing opportunities created through local as w e l l
as regional and international investment.
Growth in the agricultural sector will also depend o n improving access to and the
25.
quality o f infrastructure services, particularly in rural areas. T o this end, IDA’s Energy
Reform project will help increase access to electricity in rural and peri-urban areas, by
providing reliable, affordable and sustainable electricity to some one m i l l i o n consumers
in Cab0 Delgado, Nampula, Inhambane, Tete, Zambezia and Maputo; this will also help
to increase the viability and competitiveness o f SMEs in agriculture and other sectors,
thereby enabling more small-scale processing o f agricultural commodities. In addition,
the First National Water Development project will help improve access to safe water in
the rural areas, both for consumption and small-scale irrigation; this will b e achieved
through rehabilitating and extending the water network and also by providing access at
point-source rural water facilities. Rural access to markets will b e expanded through
IDA’s Roads and Bridges project, which will improve road coverage and conditions
throughout the country, with a focus o n secondary and tertiary roads in phase 2.

26.
Micro, small and medium enterprises: Support to local enterprises, o f which
most are SMEs, will b e provided through I D A ’ s Enterprise Development project (PoDE),
which aims to focus Government and private-sector resources o n activities will help
improve the competitiveness o f Mozambican f i r m s in sectors where Mozambique has a
comparative advantage. This will b e done through technical assistance to M I C , MITUR,
the Chamber o f Commerce and CPI (with IDA and MIGA both assisting CPI), with a
view to improving the capacity o f these institutions to conceive, implement and monitor a
consensual and focused private-sector development strategy.
27.

Mozambique has also been included in a list o f eight African pilot countries for a
new joint I D A - I F C initiative for micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprise (MSME)
development. The proposed M S M E Program aims to address constraints to growth and
increasing access to finance; (ii)
opening access to new markets
competitiveness by: (i)
by building the technical capacities o f businesses and intermediaries located in
Mozambique; (iii)
enhancing sustainable linkages between SMEs and larger private
sector investments; and (iv) improving the enabling environment for private sector
participation through reduction o f rate tape. The details o f this program are being defined
and will b e implemented over the C A S period, with initial activities being implemented
through the restructured Enterprise Development Project.

Annex 6
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)’

I.

The national M&E environment

1.
The Government o f Mozambique i s committed to developing a results-oriented
public service which i s aligned with the k e y objectives o f the PARPA and accountable to
citizens. Within the Government, there are a number o f high-level advocates for M&E,
including the President, the Prime Minister, and several Ministers.
2.
The responsibility for PARPA monitoring currently rests with the Poverty
Monitoring Unit o f the Ministry o f Planning and Finance (MPF). This unit has received
considerable donor support, which has helped i t s staff to develop a good understanding o f
M&E issues and to acquire appropriate skills. Methodological guidelines and practical
tools are still being developed.

3.
Good progress i s being made with respect to PARPA implementation monitoring
arrangements through the Government’s development and use o f a detailed Performance
Assessment Framework (PAF) matrix to monitor PARPA activities by sector, and
through the establishment of the Poverty Observatory, which provides a broad
consultative forum (including representatives o f c i v i l society and development partners)
for dissemination and discussion o f PARPA objectives and accomplishments. C i v i l
society has opportunities to participate in discussions and decisions related to national
development issues, particularly in relation to implementation o f the PARPA, but there i s
room for improvement in institutionalizing participation o f citizen groups and the private
sector in the oversight of public administration. In addition, the integrated systems and
culture necessary to support effective M&E of development goals are not yet in place.

4.
A donor-supported evaluation capacity diagnostic exercise was undertaken in
M a y 2001.2 During a subsequent workshop, a local working group led by the Ministry o f
Foreign Affairs (MINEC) and with participation f r o m MPF, the Ministry o f State
Administration, and the Prime Minister’s Office, agreed inter alia to develop and submit
to donors an action plan to meet Mozambique’s capacity-building needs in the M&E
area, and also to pursue a recommendation to carry out country-led evaluation exercises
in the health and agriculture sectors. These initiatives were not carried forward for
various reasons, but principally due to a lack o f strong leadership, incentives, and
ownership o f the process.

This Annex was prepared by Diana Masone, AFTQK. The information in this note i s drawn from the
Joint Staff Assessments of the Mozambique Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper and 2003 Progress Report,
the 2003 Public Expenditure Review, the results o f a multi-donor supported evaluation capacity diagnostic
exercise undertaken in 2001, the W o r l d Bank’s Public Sector Reform Project appraisal document, other
relevant documents, as w e l l as observations and a survey o f staff involved in the W o r l d Bank’s program o f
assistance to Mozambique.
The exercise was supported by a donor consortium consisting o f the Office o f Evaluation o f UNDP, the
Operations Evaluation Department o f the W o r l d Bank, and the Government o f the Netherlands.

M&E challenges

5.
The M&E system o f the Cabinet Office focuses primarily o n monitoring the
processing o f national policies implemented by concerned ministries and agencies. This
system i s seen as needing substantial improvement, including development o f capacity to
evaluate policy and track its impact, rather than merely tracking i t s processing.
6.
The quality o f statistics collected by the National Statistics Office (NSO) i s
considered to be good in terms o f data coverage, reliability, timeliness, and access, but to
monitor PARPA implementation effectively there are improvements needed in sectoral
data and in poverty indicators, including particularly income and consumption data. I t i s
critical to build capacity and provide incentives to establish sound management
information systems (MISS), particularly in priority sector ministries. The availability and
quality o f administrative data, and particularly expenditure data, i s reportedly poor o n the
whole, often being neither comprehensive nor reliable. Few ministries or agencies appear
to have functional M I S or M&E systems. In many cases M&E information i s not used
properly for decision-making. There are some exceptions where M&E data availability
and/or use i s good (e.g. education, road maintenance), and in a few ministries planned or
ongoing donor-funded activities aim to strengthen M I S systems and/or capacity (e.g.
Environment, MADER, Natural Resources, Transport, Tourism), so the situation i s likely
to improve over time. At this point, a stocktaking exercise would b e useful, focusing
particularly o n the degree to which sectoral data are linked with expenditure data.
Demand for M&E information still comes mostly from outside Government.
7.
MPF does not systematically require information f r o m sectoral ministries o n evaluations,

priority expenditures, or outcomes related to long-term goals. M u c h o f the evaluation
that i s done is prompted by donors that are interested in evaluating implementation o f
their o w n projects or programs rather than sectoral programs as a whole.

8.
Over the past 18 months, MPF has been undertaking sector expenditure reviewsan important step forward. Yet there remain two important gaps in expenditure data
large “off-budgets” in the form o f ministerial collections
which need to be addressed: (i)
(“receitas proprias”) are not reported to MPF by the sector ministries and (ii)
key
ministries (education, health, water, roads, and agriculture) do not have data o n donorfunded expenditures. F o r the most part, information i s unavailable o n the link between
expenditures and programs, targets, outputs and outcomes.
9.
Cross-cutting fiduciary issues undermine good M&E and are beyond the control
o f individual ministries. Currently, the f l o w o f funds i s unpredictable, procurement
bottlenecks interfere with project implementation, and i t i s not possible to get a clear idea
o f cost-effectiveness.

10.
There i s also currently little integration or harmonization o f Government
information systems. Existing systems need to b e better integrated and rationalized, and
new sector-specific M&E systems should b e designed in such a w a y that they conform to
the standards and requirements o f the central system.

102

The W o r l d Bank and other donors are actively engaged in supporting a number o f
11.
activities to help address these challenges and strengthen M&E capacity, particularly in
terms o f support for public sector reforms and development o f SISTAFE (the integrated
financial management system). Donor coordination in relation to statistical capacitybuilding initiatives i s reported to be good. Nonetheless, in general, donor contributions
have tended to b e fragmented and not directly linked to Government-funded activities.

111.

Possible actions to address the challenges

At the national level, a more concerted and focused effort i s needed: (i)
to raise
12.
awareness o f the importance, relevance and benefits o f an effective M&E system as a
public sector management tool which i s complementary to the budget system, human
t o establish the necessary
resource management, and auditing functions; and (ii)
foundational elements and culture which are required to develop a results-based
orientation in the public sector. Action areas include: (a) improving the institutional
framework; (b) strengthening sectoral information systems; (c) strengthening M&E
skills within and outside Government; and (d) promoting greater donor coordination and
harmonization. Some specific actions are suggested below.
Improving the institutional framework: T o improve the institutional framework
13,
in the context o f the Public Sector Reform project, k e y activities will include:
e
e
e
e

e

14.

Promoting a culture o f accountability and incentives system to support it;
Promoting establishment o f an inter-ministerial coordination mechanism
in relation to the development o f integrated harmonized M&E systems;
Undertaking an assessment o f the information f l o w through the “system”;
Improving mechanisms for information sharing and public participation in
development decisions, e.g. through more systematic dissemination o f
national statistics and administrative data to Parliament and the public, and
through more advanced planning o f the consultation process; and
Institutionalizing participation o f citizen groups and the private sector in
public administration oversight, e.g. through advocating sectoral inclusion
policies and building appropriate fora (e.g. the National Water Forum).

Strengthening information systems: K e y activities here will include:
e

e
e
e
e

e

Undertaking an inventory o f ongoing and planned installation or major
upgrading o f M I S systems, and also monitoring progress;
Designing n e w sector-specific M&E systems to conform to standards and
meet information requirements o f the central SISTAFE system;
Undertaking case studies in selected central and sector ministries, clearly
identifying issues and documenting good practices;
Piloting country-led evaluation exercises in one or more priority sectors
(e.g. agriculture, health);
Reviewing M&E capacity needs in k e y sector ministries;
Addressing cross-cutting fiduciary areas; and
103

0

Ensuring that reliable poverty data i s collected o n a regular basis (e.g.
through annual income and consumption panel surveys).

Strengthening M&E skills: There i s also ample scope for improving M&E skill

levels, with activities including:

Enhancing Governments capacity for clearer goal-setting within the
planning process, project and program management, financial
management, data analysis, and performance auditing;
Strengthening the policy analysis skills o f the Cabinet Office;
Strengthening the statistical capacity o f staff in the PARPA priority
ministries;
Strengthening capacity to undertake comprehensive poverty analyses, in
particular concerning gender aspects and issues o f vulnerability;
Strengthening civil society capacity to h o l d Government accountable;
Developing M&E capacity at all levels o f Government (central, sectoral
and provincial) and in c i v i l society (i.e. within N G O s and CBOs); and
Developing and retaining sufficient country-based skills required to
support SISTAFE and the related sub-systems.

15.
Improving donor coordination: Here activities should include (i)
establishing
mechanisms for sharing information and coordinating support for M&E enhancement
(e.g. expanding existing coordinating mechanisms for statistical capacity building to
promoting harmonization o f
include broader M&E capacity building activities); and (ii)
donor-supported M&E systems and reporting requirements.
16.
There i s also a need to improve M&E in the Bank’s portfolio. This need was
identified and discussed during the 2003 CPPR and i s part o f the CPPR Action Plan,
which i s to be monitored quarterly. The M&E arrangements for the Bank-supported
Public Sector Reform project in Mozambique offer an example o f good practice.
The importance o f linking M&E in the Bank’s portfolio with sector M&E and the
17.
national system i s recognized and has been reflected in the Bank’s strategy. C A S
activities are closely aligned with the PARPA objectives, and the C A S Results
Framework i s linked, inter alia, to the Government’s PAF matrix for monitoring
implementation o f the PARPA and progress towards the PARPA objectives.

IV.

Next Steps

Building an effective national M&E system will take several years and require
18.
coordination across ministries, through different levels o f Government, and between
users and producers of data. Sustained commitment i s therefore needed at both the
political and technical levels. Lack o f strong leadership and ownership o f the M&E
capacity development initiative were deemed to b e the reasons for lack o f follow-up to
the 2001 donor-supported evaluation capacity diagnostic exercise. I t i s therefore

104

recommended that Government take the following three initial steps to rapidly move the
M&E agenda forward in Mozambique.

(0

(ii)

(iii)

Identifi M&E leadership in Mozambique, e.g. through focus group discussions
with Government advocates o f M&E. The objective would be to identify a
strategically located counterpart group with sufficient authority and political
support to operationalize M&E in Mozambique (this includes but i s not limited
to the poverty monitoring agenda). Participants in the 2001 evaluation exercise
should be included in this focus group discussion.
Clearly demonstrate the key M&E issues, e.g. through undertaking case studies
o f M&E systems in one or t w o central ministries, and in one or t w o sector
ministries (e.g. agriculture, education), to look at: (i)
the quality and reliability
utilization o f the data currently available; (iii)
the efficiency
o f existing data; (ii)
o f data collection exercises, including possible duplications or unnecessarily
burdensome reporting requirements. This would help to understand and
demonstrate the issues, and possibly identify good practices.
Get all the stakeholders on board in developing a national M&E strategy and
Action Plan, e.g. through organizing a national M&E stakeholders workshop (to
be jointly sponsored by Government and donor partners) to generate broader
interest in M&E and to bring stakeholders to a common understanding. The
above could be presented to help
results of the case studies suggested in (ii)
illustrate the importance, relevance and benefits o f sound M&E arrangements,
particularly o n the part o f data providers within k e y sector ministries. The
objective o f the workshop w o u l d be to develop a prioritized and time-bound
action plan of activities to address the issues and meet Mozambique’s capacity
needs in the M&E area.

19.
Actions beyond the three steps proposed above would depend o n the results o f
discussions with stakeholders and the eventual strategy and action plan for improving
M&E capacity in Mozambique. These should include follow-up to the recommendations
o f the evaluation capacity diagnostic exercise undertaken in 2001, and the Joint BankIMF Staff Assessment recommendations made with respect to the 2003 PARPA Progress
Report.
Discussions are ongoing between the Government and the Bank regarding h o w
20.
the Bank might best support the Government’s M&E enhancement activities, and will be
further pursued in the context o f preparation o f the first Poverty Reduction Support
Credit (PRSC1). Possible financial vehicles for Bank support, which are s t i l l under
discussion, include PRSP Trust Funds, IDF grants, and a STATCAP Adaptable Program
Loan.

Annex 7
Debt Sustainability, I D A support and the HIPC Initiative’

1.
This Annex updates Mozambique’s Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) since
attaining the completion point under the enhanced HIPC initiative in September 2001. A
few background paragraphs are followed by a discussion o f updated NPV ratios under
the base case and low case scenarios, as well as two sensitivity analyses (one assuming
high case IDA lending and one assuming lower project grants).
I.

Background

2.
Mozambique reached the completion point under the original and enhanced HIPC
Initiatives in June 1999 and September 2001, respectively. Debt r e l i e f under the original
framework amounted to $1,716 million in NPV terms, and assistance under the enhanced
framework amounted to $306 million.2 Based on projections presented in the
Completion Point Document under the EnhancedHIPC Initiative, the NPV o f debt-toexports ratio after the provision o f HIPC assistance and bilateral debt relief beyond HIPC
was expected to fall from 102% in 2002 to 41% in 2020, and the NPV o f debt-to-GDP
ratio was expected to fall from 28.0% in 2002 to 14.1% in 2020.
3.
IDA assistance under the original and the enhanced HIPC initiatives amounted to
$381 million3 and $62 million in NPV terms, respectively. Assistance under the original
the provision o f $154 million in IDA grants during
HIPC Initiative was delivered by: (i)
the interim period, equivalent to $54 million in NPV terms and (ii)
cancellation o f eight
IDA credits with an NPV o f $327 million. Assistance due under the enhanced HIPC
Initiative i s being delivered through debt service reductions through 2009, including
100% debt service relief provided during the interim period.

11.

Debt sustainability analysis over the medium term

4.
A t end-2002, Mozambique’s nominal stock o f total external debt, including
. ~ nominal stock o f public and
private non-guaranteed, was estimated at $4.8 b i l l i ~ n The
publicly guaranteed debt, including to the IMF, was $2.7 billion or 69% o f GDP. O f the
latter, 95% i s on concessional terms and about 62% i s owed to multilateral institutions, o f
which 58% i s owed to IDA. As a result o f debt r e l i e f granted so far under the original
and enhanced HIPC Initiatives, the estimated ratio o f debt-service-to-exports5 for 2002
was 5.1%.

Initially the assistance under the enhanced framework estimated at the decision point was $254 million in
N P V terms; however, at the completion point this amount was increased to $306 m i l l i o n in N P V terms
following a revision o f the stock o f debt as o f end-1998.

Over the last 18 months, since Mozambique achieved the completion point under
5.
the enhanced HIPC Initiative, the country’s economic performance in terms o f GDP
growth was slightly better on average than expected at the time o f the completion point.
GDP grew by 13.0% and 8.3% in 2001 and 2002, respectively, versus the 9.6% and 9.8%
percent envisaged in the Completion Point Document. O n the other hand, exports were
slightly lower than expected in 2001 and 2002, by about $7 million in the three-year
moving average o f 2000-2002. Under the same discount and exchange rates, this would
bring the NPV o f debt6to GDP ratio in 2002 down to 25% from 28% as presented in the
Completion Point Document o f the enhanced HIPC (including r e l i e f beyond HIPC), but
the NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio would increase from 101.6% to 102.3%.
6.
Updated estimates o f the NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio were prepared based on the
stock o f debt reconciled for the Completion Point Document, updated exports, new
borrowing figures and more recent discount and interest rates.7 The updated interest rates
are lower in general than the ones used in the Completion Point Document for the
enhanced HIPC Initiative and would bring the end 2002 NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio to
118.9%.8 Nevertheless, the overall debt sustainability analysis and conclusions remain
the same as at the time o f the Completion Point Document o f the Enhanced HIPC in
September 2001. Mozambique’s high debt burden would be reduced to medium and
long-term sustainable levels by the HIPC Initiative and bilateral assistance beyond HIPC.
Following are the results o f the DSA under the various scenarios and sensitivity analysis.

The base case scenario predicts real GDP growth, on average, o f about 6.6% per
7.
annum between 2003 and 2020. This i s slightly lower than the 7% average growth
experienced since 1987, when growth represented a “bounce-back” from the war and
structural reforms. Growth in this and the next decade i s projected to be driven by a
substantial rise in investment. Exports o f goods and services, excluding large projects,
are expected to grow around 8% per annum on average in nominal dollar terms, slightly
lower than the 9.5% growth in the 1990s. Including large projects, exports o f goods and
services are expected to increase around 11% on average per annum between 2003 and
2020. In comparison w i t h the Completion Point Document, the N P V o f debt-to-export
ratio i s projected to reach 89.4% by 2005, 64.6% by 2010 and 48.8% by 2020, compared
to 61.1 %, 46.7% and 40.6% as projected in the Completion Point Document,
re~pectively.~
Although the updated ratios are significantly above the levels projected at
the completion point, they remain well below 150%. Furthermore, under the base case
scenario, the ratios are projected to fall over time. I t i s important to mention that the
projected trajectory o f the NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio could change significantly
depending on the realization o f the projected exports under the large projects.
8.
The lower growth scenario assumes slightly lower GDP and export growth due
mainly to external factors, and higher IDA lending. It i s assumed that GDP will grow

The updated discount rates correspond to the average currency specific CIRRs for the period JulyDecember 2002 and the updated exchange rates correspond to the end 2002 values.

about 1% less on average between 2004 and 2020, with two simulated droughts in 2004
and 2009. Exports and imports would also grow less rapidly as constant elasticities to
GDP are assumed. But IDA lending i s higher, as in the high CAS scenario presented in
the main document, because lower performance i s assumed to be due to exogenous
factors. Under this scenario, the NPV o f debt to export ratios reaches 77.7% by 2020.

The high case IDA lending simulation under the same macroeconomic indicators
9.
as the base case assumes that IDA disbursements would be higher due to increased
commitments and improved portfolio management. Overall, Mozambique’s borrowing
under this simulation would remain the same as in the base case. Debt sustainability
analysis under this scenario i s very similar to the base case, with the NPV o f debt-toexport increasing only to 5 1.1 % by 2020.
10.
The last sensitivity analysis assumes lower grants compensated by higher bilateral
borrowing. Grants are assume to fall to $150 million by 2020, which would b e about
$135 m i l l i o n lower per year, on average, between 2005-20. Under this assumption, the
NPV o f debt-to-exports would increase to 77.3% by 2020, almost the same as in the l o w
case scenario.

In summary, under new interest, exchange rate and macroeconomic estimates and
projections, Mozambique i s s t i l l withn the framework o f manageable debt, even when
taking into account the worse-case scenario presented here. Overall, the updated ratios
would be well below 150%. Furthermore, under the base case and high case scenarios,
the ratios are projected to fall over time, though these results could change significantly
depending on the realization o f the projected exports under the large projects.
