2. Executive Summary

iii.
This was an ambitious program with uneven results. Under Pillar 1 WBG assistance helped
improve key infrastructure, partially succeeded in accelerating corporate restructuring and
privatization, and had marginal success in improving the business climate. Under Pillar 2, WBG
assistance helped deliver better municipal services and primary healthcare, and partially succeeded in
strengthening municipal finance and reducing urban-rural income disparities. But the targeting of
social services did not improve as expected under the program. Moreover, contrary to program
objectives, government spending as a share of GDP increased (in part due to the 2008-9 financial
crisis), while fiscal coordination among the entities that make up BiH has suffered setbacks. On
balance, IEG rates the outcome of the WBG’s program as a whole as moderately satisfactory.

CPSCR Review

i.
This review assesses the implementation of the FY08-11 Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) CPS,
as well as the CPS completion report. The strategy was jointly implemented by IBRD/IDA, IFC and
MIGA, and this review covers the joint program of the three agencies.
ii.
BiH is a post-conflict state, whose governing structure complicates decision making and is
prone to slow policy making and implementation. Poverty remains high for a European country, and
political tensions have slowed progress towards EU accession, to which BiH aspires. The CPS and
CPSPR were well aligned with BiH’s strategy, focusing on two pillars: improving the environment for
private sector led growth; and improving the quality of government spending and delivery of public
services.

iv.
This review has three recommendations. The WBG could explore ways of dealing effectively
with the political stalemate between the entities in program implementation, beyond the distinction
between core and non-core areas. Maintaining a vigorous general and open policy dialogue on what is
now labeled non-core seems as a more effective way of helping BiH move forward in its growth and
development efforts in these particular areas. Second, strategy objectives could be better linked to the
interventions of the program. Most projects completed in the evaluation period and assessed by IEG
were rated satisfactory or moderately satisfactory, but a close review of achievement of CPS
objectives in the respective areas shows a less rosy picture. This suggests either that objectives were
over-ambitious given the interventions that were programmed, or that the chosen interventions were
not the right ones for the objectives. Third, on strategy implementation, the WBG could do better by
improving its understanding of the binding constraints on private sector development in BiH, and
structuring its interventions accordingly. The strategy for private sector development fell well short of
objectives, suggesting that WBG interventions—at business entry—did not deal with the main
constraints impacting businesses at the operations stage (identified as mostly bureaucratic
interference).

3. CPS Summary
Overview of CPS Relevance:
Country Context
1

1.
BiH is a post-conflict state, whose governing structure complicates decision making, turning
policy consensus into an elusive target. Politics remains highly fragmented, with increasing tensions
between the two entities, namely the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (the Federation) and
Republika Srpska (the RS). Poverty is high for a European country, and political tensions have slowed
progress towards EU accession, to which BiH aspires. BiH remains in the IBRD/IDA blend category of
the WBG.
2.
Growth averaged 5-6 percent a year in BiH in 2000-08, driven by a boom in domestic demand
financed from abroad. Foreign lending to BiH virtually came to a halt as a result of the financial crisis,
pushing the economy into recession in 2009. A moderate recovery has taken place since then.
Poverty declined slightly over the past decade, especially in urban areas, as rural areas are lagging.
About 18 percent of the population lives in poverty and 80 percent of the poor live in rural areas. The
main challenges facing BiH are to maintain growth through further diversification of the economy, to
enhance capacity and productivity in the export sectors, and to improve the business and investment
environment.
3.
The BiH authorities’ medium-term development strategy (―the platform‖) calls for improving
fiscal coordination and stability, creating a more conducive business environment, and promoting
reforms that ensure sustainable development.
Objectives of WBG Strategy
4.
The CPS and CPSPR responded to country challenges by focusing on two pillars:
(i) improving the environment for private sector led growth, and (ii) improving the quality of public
spending and delivery of public services. This was to be done through balanced interventions to
achieve the program’s objectives. The CPSPR introduced some changes in the results matrix to better
align the performance of individual projects with the CPS pillars, introduce performance indicators that
were not included in the original matrix, including adding new indicators on ―formal employment‖ and
improved targeting of social benefits. It also responded to the changing country context in the
aftermath of the global financial crisis with a development policy operation addressing public
expenditure. IFC and MIGA interventions complemented IBRD/IDA interventions, with investment—
including in privatization—and advisory services aimed at developing the private sector, and providing
guarantees for a sizeable foreign direct investment in leasing and manufacturing, respectively.
5.
The WBG strategy addressed some of the key challenges facing BiH, such as improving the
business and investment environment. It also responded flexibly to the evolving global financial crisis
at the CPSPR stage. The strategy appears to have under-estimated the time and efforts needed to
build the consensus required to develop the institutional arrangements for project execution.
Relevance of the WBG Strategy
6.
Relevance of the strategy was modest. The CPS aimed at improving the business
environment, and improving the quality of government spending and delivery of services. The
1

BiH consists of two autonomous entities—the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (the Federation) and the Republika
Srpska (the RS)—and a state-level government that acts as an umbrella organization. Policies are largely made and
implemented at the entity level, but coordination of policies between entities and with the state is an ongoing challenge.
The Federation is divided into ten cantons and seventy-four municipalities, and the RS is divided into sixty-three
municipalities.

interventions were generally appropriate to achieve the proposed outcomes, except that in the
business environment the WBG concentrated its efforts on processes for business entry. However, the
main constraints, which the interventions left untouched, appeared to have been at the operating
stage, with most of the problems caused by corruption and by excessive bureaucratic interference.
The CPS and CPSPR went into some detail in the analysis of the political economy, and structured
assistance around core areas where government commitment to reform was clear, and non-core
areas where commitment was less certain. This distinction, which reflected pragmatism about the
political stalemate between the entities, turned out to have little bearing on the delivery of the program
and did not effectively mitigate the political economy risks. In addition, the link between IBRD/IDAsupported interventions and objectives was not always clear, as was the case with the expected
increase in formal employment.
7.
Consistent with the overall WBG strategy and congruent with market needs, IFC combined its
investment operations with advisory services to improve access to finance and competitiveness of
SMEs, develop trade finance to help trade flows during the global financial crisis, and explore
opportunities for public-private partnership projects. MIGA provided guarantees for investments in the
financial sector and manufacturing.
Risk Identification and Mitigation
8.
As noted above, the CPS identified as the main risk to the program the political polarization
between the three constituent groups (Bosnians, Croats, and Serbs). Aside from distinguishing
between core and non-core activities, the strategy intended to manage this risk by negotiating the
degree and form of state-level involvement on a project-by-project basis in the non-core areas (the
Federation generally wanted the state more involved, while the RS wanted it involved less or not at
all). Ongoing tensions between the constituent groups did indeed result in a major slowdown of policy
progress and program implementation, and, partly as a result, several projects in the original CPS had
to be dropped or postponed.
Overview of CPS Implementation:
Lending, Investments and Grants
9.
Fourteen IBRD/IDA and ten IFC projects were in operation in BiH at inception of the CPS for
US$289 million and US$141 million, respectively. In all, including MIGA, the WBG program comprised
six new IBRD/IDA lending operations for $306 million, additional project financial support of
US$83 million for six IFC projects, over US$9 million in GEF grants, and three MIGA operations for
US$61 million. About one-third of IBRD/IDA lending was devoted to an unplanned Public Expenditure
Crisis DPL in response to the global financial crisis; and, of the remainder, most was used for
infrastructure and SME competitiveness, with a small amount devoted to the health sector. IFC’s
support was in the financial sector, health, and chemicals. Several IBRD/IDA projects were dropped
from the original plan, and two were postponed to the next CPS period (Sava River/Brcko Port and
Land Registration II).
10.
Performance of the IBRD/IDA projects that made it through the difficult political environment
was good, and the portfolio remained healthy. Outcomes of six of the seven projects completed in the
evaluation period and assessed by IEG were rated satisfactory or moderately satisfactory. As of June
2011 the active portfolio consisted of 14 projects, with the amount of commitments at risk representing
6.3 percent, compared with an ECA average of 12 percent. The only project that is at-risk in
implementation was rated as moderately unsatisfactory by implementation reports, and the project is
being restructured to address the weaknesses identified.
11.
IFC followed a strategy of further developing the firms it had supported before in financial
markets (microfinance and trade facility) and in chemicals. However, IFC also initiated support to new

CPSCR Review

areas, as was building a private health facility. Development effectiveness (as indicated in the DOTS
system) of about half of IFC investments have been rated moderately satisfactory or better, with
another quarter that has not been rated or rated too early to tell. IFC appears to have pulled back its
activities slightly as the country situation has been found to be increasingly risky.
12.
In addition, MIGA approved three operations in support of investments in the manufacturing
and financial sectors.
Advisory and Analytical Activities and Services
13.
While AAA pieces were well timed and served as input to lending, in some instances findings
and recommendations did not find their way to implementation because of lack of buy-in and weak
absorptive capacity. A policy note on social assistance transfers (FY09) and a poverty update (FY10)
provided analytical underpinning for reforms of the social protection system that were initiated in late
2009 and early 2010. Additional advisory work focused on the investment climate assessment (FY08),
the transport sector (FY10), and competitiveness.
14.
During the review period, IFC approved eight advisory projects on renewable energy intended
to promote small hydro-power plants, as well as on sustainable business, investment climate, and
access to finance.
Safeguards and Fiduciary Issues
15.
The small-scale agriculture project triggered environmental and international waterways
safeguards. According to the environmental assessment, environmental issues were linked to the
rehabilitation and reconstruction of irrigation systems and water use, and direct impacts were likely to
be small to insignificant. A local water institute in the RS supervised the operation of the contracts to
ensure proper disposals of waste from the works of irrigation rehabilitation and monitoring of soil and
water quality during construction. On international waterways, the water user associations collaborated
with entity water agencies and shared information with the power companies based on the minimum
flow in the Neretva and Tebisjica rivers. There were no fiduciary complaints that IEG is aware of.
Overview of Achievement by Objective:
Pillar 1: Improving the Environment for Private Sector-Led Growth and for Convergence with
Europe
16.
Under this pillar the WBG’s support was to focus on (i) expanding business activity and
increasing economic opportunity; (ii) improving key infrastructure; (iii) strengthening regional
cooperation to manage public goods, including environment and clean energy; and (iv) invigorating
privatization and corporate restructuring.
17.
Expanding business activity and increasing economic opportunity. In the World
Economic Forum’s competitive index scale of 1 to 7, BiH’s business environment improved marginally
from 3.6 to 3.7 in the evaluation period. WBG interventions helped reduce the number of days to
register a business, cut the backlog of land registration, and improve agricultural information systems.
However, the relevant ICR reviews noted that the main constraints in this area were at the business
operating stage—rather than business entry, where the WBG concentrated efforts. Most of the
constraints were due to corruption and excessive bureaucratic interference, which the interventions left
untouched. BiH still lags behind other countries in South-Eastern Europe which have shown
significantly faster improvement in the business environment. WBG support came in the form of a
Business Environment Structural Adjustment Credit, Land Registration Project, and an Agricultural and
Rural Development Project.

18.
IFC continued to firm the development of an alternative dispute resolution mechanism, which
had been introduced under the previous CPS. In addition, an IFC investment project for automotive
parts expanded business activity at Novi Travnik, Zenica, and Gradacac—through Cimos, a Slovenian
firm, parts manufactured in BiH go into 4.5 million cars produced by BMW, Audi, Ford, and Toyota.
19.
Improving key infrastructure. The WBG strategy focused on maintaining roads, improving
commercial use of the Sava river corridor, and developing energy resources. Road rehabilitation made
progress (70 percent of planned road sections rehabilitated); road user costs declined across the
country (11 percent in RS and 18 percent in the Federation); and transport strategy implementation is
advancing. Nevertheless, progress in the latter has been uneven—more advanced in the Federation
than in RS. Energy generation and exports of energy have increased significantly, but the independent
system operator is not functioning because of disputes between the Federation and RS. WBG support
came through the Road Infrastructure and Safety Project, the Energy Community of South-East
Europe Project, and a Transport Sector Review. The Sava river project was postponed.
20.
Strengthening regional cooperation to manage public goods. Notwithstanding the
broadness of the objective, which specifically mentioned environment and clean energy, the WBG
focused on a small subset of the public good universe: protecting forests and enhancing the capacity
for an effective response to avian influenza infection. The ecosystem protected area increased to
2.4 percent of the territory—against a 3 percent target—and interventions helped reach the target for
safe handling procedures of avian influenza at risk population. The interventions were supported by
GEF Forest and Mountain Protected Areas, and an Avian Influenza Preparedness Project.
21.
Invigorating privatization and corporate restructuring. Little progress was made in this
objective: only six strategic enterprises were privatized during the CPS period—less than half the
target number—and enterprise restructuring made little headway in both entities, according to both
CPSCR and the IMF. Underperforming state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and un-restructured privatized
companies continue to be a significant drag on BiH’s economy. SOEs remain inefficient, and a source
of corruption and political influence. Moreover, the dispersed structure of ownership resulting from
voucher-to-share conversion has induced poor corporate governance and weak firm performance,
which have not been abated due to the shallowness of capital markets. As a result many privatized
enterprises remain undercapitalized, operate below potential, and have accumulated arrears to the
government for worker pension obligations, taxes, and unpaid salaries to workers. Given the limited
political commitment to privatization and enterprise restructuring, IBRD provided limited support
through the administration of an EU-funded trust fund (Accelerating Enterprise Restructuring) and AAA
in the form of an Investment Climate Assessment.
22.
On a positive note, IFC, jointly with Turkish investors, was instrumental in the privatization of a
glass manufacturing company.
23.
WBG assistance contributed significantly to improving key infrastructure (core) and had partial
success in improving cooperation to manage public goods (core). Corporate restructuring and
privatization (non-core) made slight progress, and the business climate improved marginally (core). On
balance, the outcome under this pillar was borderline moderately satisfactory.
Pillar 2: Improving the Quality of Government Spending and the Delivery of Public Services for
the Vulnerable
24.
Under this pillar the WBG’s support was to focus on (i) improving the delivery of municipal
services and strengthen municipal finance; (ii) improving the quality of social service delivery;
(iii) reducing urban-rural disparities in income; (iv) increasing the targeting of social benefits; and
(v) reducing the burden of government in the economy and strengthening fiscal coordination.

25.
Improving delivery of municipal services and strengthening municipal finance. During
the CPS period water losses were reduced in all participating municipalities and twenty-four hour
water supply extended to some places for the first time. It should be noted, however, that water
service targets for some municipalities had already been achieved by the beginning of the CPS period.
Six regional sanitary landfills are now fully functional, with the number of unregulated dumpsites
reduced by 15 percent, less than the target of 20 percent. A community development project (CDP)
helped improve basic services and facilities for low-income and poor communities in under-served
municipalities. The project delivered a considerable number of outputs—construction and rehabilitation
of facilities, enhanced social infrastructure such as libraries, youth centers and sports clubs—and
there is some evidence of positive outcomes. A survey summarized in the project’s ICR reports that
52 percent of those interviewed in the Federation and 62 percent in the RS considered that their living
conditions had improved as a result of the new services provided under the project. In addition to the
CDP and a Solid Waste Management Project, IBRD/IDA helped improve the delivery of services in
large municipalities through the Urban Infrastructure and Service Delivery Project.
26.
Improving the quality of social service delivery. IBRD intended to help improve basic
heath indicators through better primary health care in the country, which were lagging due to the
excessive focus on specialists’ services. Following this support, there was a 75 percent increase in
examinations by family doctors in the Federation (against a target of 55 percent). However, there is
limited information on developments in the RS, and there is little hard evidence of improvements in
health indicators as yet. WBG support was provided through the Health Sector Enhancement Project.
27.
Reducing urban-rural disparities in income. The WBG sought to help increase rural
incomes through its project on small-scale commercial agriculture. While agricultural production and
productivity increased, the extent to which this translated into an increase in farm incomes and the
extent to which commercialization occurred were not measured by the WBG or the authorities, and is
not known. Available evidence suggests that rural-urban income disparities remain significant,
because most agriculture sector activity is informal and subsistence agriculture still plays an important
role.
28.
Increasing the targeting of social benefits. The WBG intended to support the improvement
of benefit targeting through the Social Safety Net and Employment Support Project (SSNES), aiming
to ensure that social benefits reach 70 percent of the poorest quintile. In the event, legislation was
approved establishing a needs-based approach. However, there are no measurable results yet, and
there is significant pressure by interest groups to maintain the current levels of spending with no
improvements in targeting. Less than 40 percent of the overall social assistance budget is targeted to
the poorest 20 percent of the population (among the lowest in ECA), and over 16 percent of the
benefits are captured by the richest fifth of the population. At the root of poor benefit targeting is the
large preponderance of benefits that go to war veterans and their families, a legacy of the peace
agreements. In addition to the SSNES project, the WBG supported BiH in this area through analytical
work (Proxy Means Targeting for Equitable and Sustainable Social Assistance and Social Safety
Nets).
29.
Reducing the burden of government in the economy and strengthen fiscal
coordination. Fiscal expenditure increased to over 50 percent of GDP in BiH over the CPS period—
against the target of a reduction of 2 percentage points from a baseline of 41 percent of GDP. Higher
expenditures were to some extent a response to the global financial crisis, which brought a decline in
formal employment. Fiscal coordination improved in the initial stages of the CPS, but has suffered
setbacks recently, amidst institutional gridlock resulting from political tensions. As a result, the Fiscal
Council—a state-level institution that is supposed to strengthen fiscal coordination—has not adopted
the 2011 fiscal envelope for the country. With political tensions increasing, coordination on fiscal policy
is likely to weaken amongst the entities that make up BiH. IBRD provided support through the Public
Expenditure Crisis DPL. The lead agency on macroeconomic and fiscal issues was the IMF, which
remains concerned about fiscal developments and is requesting corrective actions.

WBG assistance had partial success in improving the delivery of municipal services and
strengthening municipal finance (core) and improving primary health care (non-core). But the WBG’s
contribution to reducing urban-rural income disparities (non-core) is not known. Legislation
notwithstanding, the targeting of social benefits (non-core) has not improved. The burden of
government on the economy (non-core) has increased rather than declined, while fiscal coordination
(non-core) has not improved. On balance, and based mainly on the results in the core area, the
outcome under this pillar is rated moderately satisfactory.

Overall outcome:
31.
The overall outcome is rated moderately satisfactory. This was an ambitious program with
uneven results. Pillar 1 had four core sub-objectives out of five, while Pillar 2 had only one out of five.
Under Pillar 1, WBG assistance helped improve key infrastructure and regional cooperation to manage
a few public goods, and had partial success in improving the delivery of municipal services and
primary health care, and strengthening municipal finance. The business climate—a core area—
improved only marginally, and corporate restructuring and privatization—the only non-core area under
pillar 1—had limited success. Under Pillar two, the core area of municipal finance and services had
some success in terms of outputs delivered, but beneficiary services show some gaps in reach. The
remaining areas under pillar two—all non-core—showed some progress but fell short of program
expectations. While WBG’s contribution to reducing urban-rural income disparities is not known, the
targeting of social benefits has not improved in a measurable way, the burden of government in the
economy has increased, and fiscal coordination has not improved.
IBRD/IDA performance
32.
IBRD/IDA performance is rated moderately satisfactory. The WBG’s strategy and program
were well aligned with BiH’s development strategy, and well coordinated with the activities of other
donors. The lending program underwent significant changes during implementation, including projects
dropped or postponed, reflecting an adverse political environment to reform in some areas and the
effects of the global financial crisis. The usefulness of the core/non-core distinction as a means to
mitigate the risks of political stalemate between the entities is questionable, because it does not seem
to have helped to improve program implementation and delivery. The WBG responded flexibly to the
global financial crisis through an unplanned DPL introduced at CPSPR stage. However, the CPSCR
provided little evidence of essential preparatory work to build consensus amongst all key entities to
develop the institutional arrangements necessary for project execution. The results framework had
deficiencies in monitoring and evaluation. AAA was generally well-timed, but findings and
recommendations did not always find their way into implementation because of lack of buy-in by mid-

CPSCR Review

level staff and weak absorptive capacity. Safeguards and fiduciary issues were adequately dealt with.
IFC performance
33.
IFC performance is rated moderately satisfactory. On the investment side, it started the
process of making BiH competitive again in two traditional industries, namely castings (for auto parts)
and glass. IFC also contributed by continuing the development of alternative dispute resolution
mechanism. Implementation of both investment and advisory services projects has been satisfactory.
MIGA performance
34.
MIGA performance is rated satisfactory. Its intervention to support a sizeable investment in
leasing appears to have been appropriate, now that foreign investors consider BiH ripe for pursuing
this activity.

5. Assessment of CPS Completion Report
35.
This is a well-written CPSCR. The evaluation is detailed and comprehensive for the most part,
although it could have dealt more in-depth with areas of the program where things did not go well, to
find out the reasons and draw lessons. Although BiH has shown a good record of growth, there has
been little progress in reducing poverty, and the CPSCR could also have explored this issue in greater
depth because this may have implications for future WBG strategy.

6. Findings and Lessons
36.
IEG agrees with the CPSCR lessons and recommendations for the next CPS, particularly on
the need to maintain a policy dialogue in key areas in the absence of lending, and to build consensus
during project preparation about institutional arrangements to be pursued during project execution.
37.
The WBG could explore ways of dealing effectively with the political stalemate between the
entities in program implementation, beyond the distinction between core and non-core areas. As
compared to sticking to a particular project, maintaining a vigorous and open policy dialogue on what
is now labeled non-core seems as a more effective way of helping BiH move forward in its growth and
development efforts in these particular areas. While some resources will have to be allocated to this
end, these expenses are outweighed by the potential benefits of helping bring about the political
consensus to move on difficult topics and issues. The current approach of giving less weight to the
non-core areas within the program seems to have reduced the IBRD’s incentives to move forcefully in
these areas.
38.
Strategy objectives could be better linked to the interventions of the program. Most projects
completed in the evaluation period and assessed by IEG were rated satisfactory or moderately
satisfactory, but a close review of achievement of CPS objectives in the respective areas shows a less
rosy picture. This suggests either that objectives were over-ambitious given the interventions that were
programmed, or that the chosen interventions were not the right ones for the objectives.
39.
As for implementation, the WBG could do better by improving its understanding of the binding
constraints on private sector development in BiH, and structuring its interventions accordingly. The
strategy for private sector development (improving business climate; acceleration of privatization and
enterprise restructuring) fell well short of objectives, suggesting that WBG interventions—at business
entry—did not deal with the main constraints in the business environment having an impact at the
business operation stage (mostly bureaucratic interference).

Annex Table 12: Summary of Achievements of the CPS Objectives
CPS 09-11: Pillar 1

Actual Results
(as of current month year)

Improve the Environment for Private Sector-Led Growth and
Convergence with Europe
Objectives
1. Expand business activity and increase economic
opportunities
2. Improve key infrastructure
3. Strengthen regional cooperation to manage
public goods
4. Invigorate privatization and corporate
restructuring
-Major
Outcome
1. Expand business activity and increase economic opportunities
Measures
Reduce the duration and number of procedures required
According to Internal Review (IR) the
to register a business:
number of days to register a business
- Baseline: In June 2007 New Business Registration
was reduced in both entities. The
System (BRS) launched – Average registration time 54
World Economic Forum
days (DB),
competiveness index increased from
- Target: 30 days in the Federation of Bosnia and
3.55 to 3.7 during CPS.
Herzegovina (FBH) and 23 days in the Republika Srpska
(RS) (2008).
According to the WB’s Doing
Business, the FBH ranking for
“Starting Business” dropped from 157
to 160, the number of procedures (12)
remained unchanged over the period
of 2008-2011, and the number of days
increased from 54 to 55. The
“Business Freedom” of the Heritage
Foundation and the Wall Street
Journal, which includes quantitative
measures of the ability to start,
operate, and close a business,
dropped too.

Develop transparent land markets through registration of
real estate:
- Baseline: In 2006 150,000 registry folders completed
in the automated database, 80,000 backlog cases,
several months to complete real estate transactions.
- Target: 2 million folders completed, full reconciliation,
no backlogs (2011).

As of June 2011, 1.45 million folders
were completed. Backlog has been
reduced to 18,305 and 80% of cases
are now resolved in 5 working days in
16 Land Registration Offices (10 in
FBH and 6 in the RS). Current
progress in implementing the Land
Registration Project provides
assurance that the program goal will
be fully achieved as planned by the
end of 2011.
As of December 31, 2010 there were
211, 682 land transactions recorded or
223% increase compared to 2006.

Substantial Progress.

Support harmonization with the EU’s Common
Agricultural Policy by supporting establishment of
agricultural information systems, and EU-compatible
payment systems for subsidies:
- Target: EU-compatible payment system designed
(2010). Initiating EU-compatible Rural Development
Grants (2011)

Rule books on farm and client registry
and livestock registry completed
(although the latter is under
amendment). In 2010, about 50% of
agriculture subsidies in RS and 30% in
FBH were structural (investment
grants) approximating IPARD
requirements. Overall, establishment
of registries at state and entity level for
effective Agricultural Information
System (AIS) required to administer
IPARD payments is progressing.

Substantial Progress.

Development Project. IR. January, 2011.

Ensure stakeholder-driven extension services are
operational:
- Baseline: Limited in the RS, none in the FBH (2007),
- Target: Stakeholder managed, contracted publicprivate extension services reaching 20% of commercial
farmers (2012).

Extension agencies established, and
draft extension strategies have been
developed in both entities. However,
the WBG assessed that drafts lack
strategic vision to develop sustainable
systems. The strategies are currently

2. Improve key infrastructure
Ensure road network is better maintained and safer:
- Baseline: In 2006 road user costs US$0.25 per km
per vehicle,
- Target: Reduction in road user costs of at least 10%
on rehabilitated roads (2011).

For the RS the average road user cost
(RUC) per vehicle-km has declined
from 0.284 Euros in 2007 to 0.253
Euros in 2011. This represents an
average 10.90 percent decline in RUC,
with variation on a section by section
basis.
RUC in Federation BiH reduced from
0.253 Euros in 2004 (baseline) to
0.208 Euros in 2011, or a decline of
17.75 percent.

Sustain or increase BH electricity generation and exports
at corresponding hydrological conditions:
- Baseline: Power generation 12,800 Gwh (2006),
- Target: Equal or greater generation and exchange
import/export transactions between EPs in BH and other
regional power utilities.

Generation and export of power in
2009 has reached record levels and
the EPRS and EPBH have earned
record profits in spite of lower prices in
the regional electricity market.

High Progress.

Improve commercial use of the Sava river corridor:
- Baseline: 2007: sections of the river are not
navigable.
- Target: Priority sections of the River Sava returned to
navigability.

Sava River Navigability Project has
been postponed due to the need to
adjust the CPS lending program in
response to the crisis.

3. Strengthen regional cooperation to manage public goods
Protect and use critical forests, water and mountain
ecosystems in a sustainable way:
- Baseline: Area under formal protection is 0.55% of
the territory (2007),
- Target: protected area 3% (2010).

Area under formal protection
increased to 2.4% or 123,000 ha.

Enhance capacity for an effective response to avian
influenza infection:
- Baseline: In 2007 weak and inconsistent safe poultry
handling procedures,
- Target: 50 % of at risk population practicing safe
handling procedures in respect to poultry meat.

Surveys and communications strategy
completed. It is estimated that 45 50%% of at risk population practices
safe-handling procedures.

4. Invigorate privatization and corporate restructuring
Advance privatization and corporate restructuring:
- Baseline: FBH - 14 SOEs scheduled for privatization
in 2008. RS - privatization about 2/3 completed, 80
enterprises to be privatized in 2008.
- Target: FBH privatization policy adopted and
implemented. RS – policy adjustment to reflect lower
quality of remaining assets to be privatized. Complete
restructuring of 12 enterprises to demonstrate possible
methods and benefits of active approach -2009.

Privatization plan was not adopted.
In the RS - 21 enterprises were
privatized over the period 2008-2010

Modest Progress.

Delivery Project. IR. June, 2011 and January, 2008.
CPSCR.

Six regional sanitary landfills have
been established and are now fully
operational. The recent assessment
suggests that 15% reduction in the
number of wild dumpsites was
achieved. This result is somewhat
below projected 20% due to lack of
counterpart financing for this activity.
However, results achieved seen as
satisfactory given the large number of
wild dumpsites.

Substantial Progress.

IR. January, 2010.

In 32 municipalities (14 in the FBH and
18 in RS) a significant part of budget
investments were made using the
Participatory Budget Planning (PBP)
approach (70% in the FBH and 50% in
RS meeting the target). Still a survey of
beneficiaries showed that a substantial
majority (72 percent) said that they had
not participated in decision-making on
community development, while sixty
percent were not satisfied with
participation in problem solving.

Modest progress, as reflected in survey of
beneficiaries.

75% increase in the FBH with
1,020,014 first examinations by FM
doctors.

Substantial Progress, although no hard evidence on
improvement in health indicators.

2. Improve the quality of social service delivery
Significant increase in utilization of family medicine (FM)
in primary health care:
- Baseline: No. of first examinations by FM doctors
(FBH: 582,716; RS: 572,876 - 2005),
- Target: increase by 55% in FBH; by 15% in RS
(2010).

CPSCR.
In the RS 4,238,848 first and control examinations
were made. 15% increase is believed to have been
achieved although the health MIS does not
differentiate between first and control visits.
Importantly, the percentage of the population
registered with upgraded FM teams increased from
about 5% to about 58% of the population.

Significant reduction in utilization of secondary and
tertiary health services:
- Baseline: No. of referrals to specialists in locations
where FM model was introduced FBH: 1,513,241 (2005),
- Target: FBH: decrease by 10% (2010).

Over 10% decrease in the number of
referrals was achieved in the FBH in
locations where FM model was
introduced (1,204,566 referrals in
2009).

3. Reduce urban-rural disparities in income
Increase in marketable horticultural produce in poor
southern BH areas:
- Baseline: 5% of farm production is marketed (2003),
- Target: 30 % of farm production marketed (2011)

There is no information available.

Negligible Progress.

Agriculture Development Project. IR. October, 2010.
CPSCR.
In southern parts of BH the area under vineyards
has doubled, and area under horticulture has
increased by 25%.

Develop further small-scale market integrated
commercial agriculture and improve access to credit for
agribusiness/ agro-processing and small farmers - in less
developed southern parts of the country:
- Baseline: 2006: US$2.15 million for agribusiness;
US$1.5 million for microcredit,
- Target: - US$4.5 million long-term loans by 2010 for
agri-business/agro-processing, US$7.5 million disbursed
as microcredit to small farmers and rural families with
99.5% repayment rates

US$4.4 million in long-term loans was
disbursed to agri-businesses in the
target area. US$ 11.5 million was
disbursed by partner microcredit
organizations to small farmers. While
portfolio at risk remained low at 1.5%,
overall quality of portfolio and
repayment rates fell in 2009 as a result
of the global financial crisis.

4. Increase the targeting of social benefits
Increase targeting of social benefits:
- Baseline: targeting accuracy of social benefits –
below 20% (2008). Social benefits reach only 18%
among the poorest quintile.
- Target: targeting accuracy of social benefits at least
40%. Social benefits reach 70% among the poorest
quintile (2012). Needs based approach.

Some progress made in terms of revising the legal
framework for non-insurance cash transfers in both
entities. Income testing was introduced for cash
transfers to veteran categories to ensure
sustainability of the system and adequate support to
the most vulnerable. Although need based approach
has now been legislated, the first results will be
measurable in mid-2012.

5. Reduce the burden of Government in the economy and strengthen fiscal coordination
Reduce the burden of Government on the economy and
strengthen fiscal coordination:
- Baseline: National Fiscal Council not established, and
fiscal targets not well coordinated between different
levels of government. Current expenditures equal to 41%
of GDP (2007),
- Target: Fiscal Council established and functional.
Sound fiscal framework maintained. The share of current
expenditures in GDP lower by 2pp (2011)

P083353 Urban Infrastructure & Service Delivery Project

The state-level Fiscal Council Law was
adopted in 2008 and the Fiscal Council
(FC) was established. The FC agreed
on the overall fiscal envelope for the
state and the two entities for 2009 and
2010. These were an integral part of
the Stand-by Agreement with the IMF
and have largely been observed. In a
pre-election context (elections in
October of 2010) the FC postponed the
adoption of overall fiscal envelope for
2011.
Formal employment grew up to 2008,
but this trend was subsequently
reversed in 2009 and 2010 as a result
of impact of the global economic crisis
on BH economy:
- 2008: 706,088 (2.7% growth
compared to 2007),
- 2009: 686,044 (-0.2% growth
compared to 2007),
- 2010: 681,332 (-0.9% growth
compared to 2007).
