EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
i.
The last World Bank Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Russia was prepared in
2002 for cooperation along three main pillars: (a) improving the business environment and
enhancing competition, (b) strengthening public sector management, and (c) mitigating social and
environmental risks. In retrospect, this appears to have been an appropriate choice o f pillars, and
World Bank Group cooperation with the Russian government was substantial and productive
throughout the CAS period.
ii.
During the CAS implementation period the economic and political context for World
Bank Group cooperation with the Russian government changed considerably. Since the
preparation of the CAS, Russia has experienced five years o f strong economic growth and
poverty reduction. Furthermore, sharp increases in the prices o f Russia’s main export
commodities, most particularly o i l and gas, have filled the coffers o f the federal government, and
provided for the accumulation o f over US$300 billion in monetary and fiscal reserves. Russia’s
global role as G-8 member, re-emerging donor, and provider o f world energy has expanded
notably. Accordingly, recent years have witnessed the beginning o f a major transition in the
nature o f cooperation between the World Bank Group and the Russian government. The Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) for 2006-2009 outlines a plan for completing this transition to a
qualitatively new and no less productive relationship that i s based on new modalities o f
cooperation.

iii.
This Country Partnership Strategy reflects a strong commitment by both the World
Bank Group and the Russian government to continue a close and productive relationship that
is suitable to the new conditions. While the federal government n o longer needs the financial
support o f the World Bank, i t s t i l l values highly World Bank knowledge, experience, and project
management skills. New borrowing by the federal government w i l l be quite limited over the
period o f this CPS, whereas the use o f guarantees, subnational borrowing and new fee-for-service
arrangements for investment and policy advice are likely to grow. IFC and MIGA operations w i l l
remain substantial (Russia i s IFC’s and MIGA’s largest exposure). The successful full transition
to new modalities o f cooperation with the Russian government w i l l depend on strong
coordination among IBRD, IFC and MIGA.
iv.
Remaining developmental challenges in a large number of Russian regions suggests
an enlarged role for the Bank Group in direct assistance at the subnational level. This i s
particularly the case for the period o f this CPS, as most far-reaching structural reforms w i l l likely
take the form o f regional initiatives or pilots. Russian regions exhibit an enormous amount o f
economic, geographic, and ethnic diversity. The federal government has encouraged the Bank
Group to deepen i t s direct involvement in the regions. Correspondingly, a central theme o f this
Strategy i s the focus o f Bank Group activities in select regions, including economic analysis
(growth and business environment diagnostics), regional development strategies, and related
investment projects.
This CPS envisions a partnership with the Russian government for the realization of
v.
four primary objectives: (a) sustaining rapid growth, (b) improving public sector management

and performance, (c) improving the delivery o f social services, and (d) enhancing Russia’s global

i

role. The f i r s t three pillars correspond closely to the pillars o f the previous CAS, and channel
support directly toward the development challenges and policies elaborated in the government’s
Medium-Term Economic Program, with a particular focus on the regions. The fourth pillar forms
the basis for a new area o f assistance, and concerns Russia’s integration in the world economy
and donor community.
vi.
Sustaining rapid growth (pillar 1) will require reducing the current high dependence of
the economy on energy prices. I t w i l l also depend on sustained macroeconomic stability, a
business climate consistent with more competition and ease of doing business, higher rates of
private investment, and measures to ensure adequate infrastructure and qualified labor supply.
The Bank Group w i l l offer a wide range o f potential assistance products under this pillar,
including support for macroeconomic policy, reserve management, supporting key state
investments and PPPs for growth and diversification, identification and alleviation o f barriers to
growth at the regional level, investment and technical assistance to support the development o f
financial markets, and direct support to the private sector.
Reforms in the public sector (pillar 2), most particularly in government administration
vii.
at federal, regional and local levels, remain high priorities in the government’s agenda.
Despite enormous progress since 1999, the most recent experience in Russia in the battle with
corruption and administrative barriers to business has been rather mixed. The Bank w i l l continue
on-going cooperation for modernizing key public sector institutions, and for reforming the
government apparatus and budgetary framework. I t w i l l also step up cooperation in judicial
reform and could become more involved in local self-government or national anti-corruption
initiatives.

The development of effective social services in health, education, housing and utilities,
viii.
and social assistance (pillar 3) has lagged behind economic growth in Russia. This poses an
obstacle to sustaining rapid welfare increases and poverty reduction in the country. The
improvement o f social services i s therefore a major focal point of current budgetary reforms and
priority National Projects in Russia. As the responsibility and initiatives for improving social
services lies at the regional level o f government, they are a natural focus o f Bank regional work
for developing effective systems o f social assistance, health care, and education. Housing and
communal services i s another possible area of Bank involvement through a national project
implemented in the regions.
Working with Russia as a donor (pillar 4) forms a new area for cooperation. Russia i s
ix.
in the process o f developing i t s ODA strategy. The Bank can support this process by providing
access to i t s development expertise and knowledge o f the new aid architecture, as well as through
the use of Bank instruments for channeling Russian developmental assistance. In addition, the
Bank Group i s a partner in the fulfillment o f Russia’s international obligations related to global
public goods. The latter includes significant potential opportunities in the carbon market.
Possible instruments of cooperation consist of direct support to the private sector (IFC
x.
and MIGA), a small number of loans to the federal government with a high share of cofinancing, subnational loans without sovereign guarantees, grants, partial risk guarantees,
conventional and reimbursable TA or project management (fee-for-service), carbon finance,
and asset management (provided by the Bank’s Treasury Department). Given Russia’s healthy
financial position, overall Bank lending w i l l be modest over the 2007-2009 CPS period.

xi.
The CPS is very much in line with the major tenets of the Bank Group’s recently
approved strategy for engagement with Middle Income Countries, as reflected b y (i)
flexible,
primary focus on providing global knowledge to Russia
demand driven nature o f the CPS; (ii)
development o f a business model
with active involvement o f local academia and think tanks; (ii)
11

for fee-based services and TA implementation; (iii)
selective use o f IBRD financial services in
support o f critical institution building and piloting o f investment finance frameworks at federal
and regional levels; (iv) increasing emphasis on sub-national financing without sovereign
guarantees; (v) engagement with Russia as a G8 member and emerging donor in support for
global development; and (vi) enhanced Bank Group synergies though closer Bank-IFC
collaboration on investment climate assessments and sub-national financing.
The proposed strategy faces some implementation risks. The significant strengthening
xii.
o f Russia’s economic and debt position has greatly reduced macroeconomic risks at the federal
level, and the financial risks in many regions. However, the full shift toward new modalities o f
cooperation, and the expansion o f programs at the subnational level, present significant
challenges. New modalities imply the need for a number o f procedural adjustments for both the
Bank and the Russian government. In order to generate a significant impact, and create
opportunities for scaling up, the Bank w i l l need to concentrate i t s limited resources primarily in a
small select group o f carefully chosen regions. If Russia’s economic and political conditions
limit the use o f traditional Bank instruments faster than anticipated, the time for developing
effective new modalities o f cooperation could prove insufficient. As the procurement
environment for Bank projects in Russia remains complex, the Bank w i l l need to pay close
attention to safeguarding i t s operations. Finally, Russia’s quest for economic diversification
points toward some potentially controversial areas o f economichndustrial policy that w i l l require
careful attention.
The period covered by this CPS is one of great opportunity for Russia. Macroeconomic
xiii.
performance has never been stronger. Fiscal and monetary reserves are accumulating at a rapid
rate. Increasing integration with world markets i s visible. Political stability and cooperation
within the government and regions have reached unprecedented levels. The Russian government
now has both the financial and political means to boost economic policies and reforms to new
levels in tackling the s t i l l formidable developmental challenges for the country. Movement to
new modalities o f work and the realization o f the proposed program present a number o f
strategic, logistical, and technical challenges to the World Bank Group and the Russian
government. Yet, the progress that has already been achieved i s sound evidence o f the possibility
o f success.

COUNTRY CONTEXT
Country Background
1.
Russia is an exceptionally large middle-income country which has undergone a
dramatic transition from a centrally planned to a market economy. Russia’s gross national
product in 2005 amounted to US$764 billion (US$5,342 per capita), placing i t in the mid range o f
middle income countries. From virtual complete state ownership in the Soviet period, roughly 80
percent o f all enterprises in Russia now operate in the private and corporate sector, and roughly
70 percent o f the housing stock has become privately owned. The territory o f the country i s vast
and accounts for 13 percent o f the world’s land mass. The Russian Federation i s divided into 88
regions (Subjects o f the Federation), which display very different socio-economic, climatic and
geographic conditions. Russia’s population o f about 143 million people includes 140 recognized
nationalities and 40 ethnic groups. Russians comprise the overwhelming majority o f the
population (80 percent), but a number o f non-Russian ethnic groups dominate on a regional basis
in republics and districts (Okrugs) o f the country. The enormous regional and ethnic diversity in
Russia complicates the task o f ensuring an efficient and harmonious development o f the entire
country.
Owing to its rich resource base, Russia plays a crucial role in global energy and
2.
resource markets. Russia has almost 30 percent (47 trillion cubic meters) o f the world’s proven
natural gas reserves, and proven o i l reserves o f 60 billion barrels. Russia currently accounts for
22 percent o f the world gas market, i s one o f the two largest o i l producers (along with Saudi
Arabia), and i s the fourth largest producer o f electricity. Russia also boasts significant wealth in
coal, uranium ore, iron-ore (around forty percent o f world reserves), copper, gold, tin, nickel,
platinum, tungsten, molybdenum. In addition, Russia i s exceptionally rich in non-metallic mineral
resources. Russia’s forests contain an estimated quarter o f the world’s timber.

Economic Developments
3.
Most of the positive macroeconomic trends in Russia identified in the 2002 CAS have
continued and strengthened. Russia i s in i t s eighth year o f robust economic growth; GDP
expanded by an estimated 48 percent between 1999 and 2006. Growth resumed following the
sharp depreciation o f the ruble and hardening o f budget constraints in the wake o f the 1998 crisis.
I t has been subsequently sustained by large terms-of-trade gains, responsible macroeconomic
policy, and some key structural reforms. H i g h o i l revenues and export growth have led to large
and growing current account surpluses (over 10 percent o f GDP in 2005). Prudent
macroeconomic policies and active debt management can be associated with high fiscal surpluses
and the achievement o f investment grade creditworthiness ratings since 2004.

The strong recent performance of the Russian economy owes to a number of factors.
In the immediate aftermath o f the crisis, the combination o f an exceedingly weak ruble,
substantial excess industrial capacity, and cheap energy resources supported an industrial
recovery and expansion that was broadly based across Russian regions. In this context, many o f
the poorer Russian regions exhibited the highest rates o f growth. As the ruble appreciated
steadily in real terms and production costs increased, growth rates in industry, and in the
economy as a whole, began to decline in 2001 and 2002 (Table 1). A number o f enterprises that
had become profitable under conditions of a weak ruble and excess capacity began to struggle,
thereby raising questions about the sustainability o f the economic expansion.

5.
I n 2003, Russia received another impetus to growth from sharp increases in the
prices of its commodity exports, most notably oil and gas. The o i l sector responded to higher
market prices with an initial rapid expansion, although capacity constraints and policy
uncertainties have slowed growth in o i l output since the second half o f 2004. Nevertheless,
higher o i l and gas prices have continued to stimulate domestic demand, which has recently
become the primary driving force o f economic growth. At the same time, the huge o i l and gas
revenue inflows have placed strong upward pressure on the Russian ruble, thereby further
increasing competitive pressures on the tradable and manufacturing sectors o f the economy.
Since the second half o f 2004, economic growth has become increasingly concentrated in trade,
construction, and services, while many sectors o f manufacturing have exhibited much slower
growth.
6.
Responsible macroeconomic policy has supported Russia’s impressive
accomplishments. The accumulation o f fiscal surpluses has been a critical factor in maintaining
overall macroeconomic stability and a slower pace o f real currency appreciation. The Russian
government and Central Bank have shown notable restraint in macroeconomic policy, and have
avoided potentially destabilizing fiscal expansions, both during the economic crisis in the late
1990s and during the period o f huge surplus o i l revenues since 2003. The tightening o f
macroeconomic policy following the crisis hardened budget constraints, and was the catalyst for
pulling Russia out the “virtual economy” syndrome o f escalating arrears, debt, and mutual offsets.
While federal budgetary revenues have soared to well over 20 percent o f GDP since 2004, federal
expenditures have remained lower than 18 percent o f GDP. Significant improvements are also
visible in budgetary practices at the federal and subnational levels, including the elimination o f
non-cash operations and most unfunded federal mandates.
7.
Although domestic and foreign
direct
investment are still somewhat low relative to Russia’s
needs, investment has been growing even more rapidly
than GDP in recent years, and has become an
increasingly important source of economic growth. From

investment (USD

a very low base in the late 1990s, fixed capital investment
has grown at any average rate o f 9 percent since 2000, as
compared to 6 percent average GDP growth. A large share
o f investment (27 percent) i s concentrated in energy and
pipelines. But substantial investment has been important
in some other sectors as well, and can be associated with
substantial restructuring in many service industries, the food industry and some areas o f machinebuilding. Inflows o f direct foreign investment have picked up notably in recent years, reaching
an estimated US$13 billion in 2005.

8.
Private sector development has benefited from far reaching tax reforms and the
reduction of some administrative barriers to business. Among a number o f structural reforms
that have improved the business environment in Russia in recent years, tax reform stands out as a
key accomplishment. The complexity, instability, and excessive formal burden o f the Russian tax
system created major problems for business development throughout the 1990s. The consistent
and determined pursuit o f tax reform has decreased the number o f taxes, lowered the overall tax
burden considerably, and greatly alleviated (although not yet solved) the problem o f perceived
instability in the business environment. Russia was one o f the first countries to pioneer a flat
income tax o f 13 percent, and has been steadily reducing the rates o f some o f the other major
taxes. The unified social tax was reduced from 35.6 to 26 percent in 2005, and the profit tax rate
declined from 35 to 24 percent. The VAT rate was reduced from 20 to 18 percent, and i t s further
reduction i s currently under discussion. In addition to taxation, surveys o f entrepreneurs confirm
positive results from a campaign since 2001 to target “administrative barriers to business” in
registration, licensing, inspections, customs, and other areas. Many indicators o f Russia’s
investment climate have improved in recent years, and Russia now compares favorably with other
transition and BRIC countries b y some o f these indicators.

Expanded profit opportunities, structural reforms, and harder budget constraints
have further accelerated the development of market institutions in Russia. One o f the most
notable changes has been the emergence o f an active market in corporate control, and a
corresponding strong shift in ownership o f the majority o f Russian f i r m s from employees to
outside shareholders. A number o f sectors o f the economy, particularly the food industry, have
attracted significant investment, undergone major restructuring, and achieved rapid productivity
growth. From the verge o f collapse in 1998, the Russian banking sector has rebounded and i s
growing rapidly, although levels o f financial intermediation remain low relative to Central
Europe. A number o f larger Russian f i r m s have become increasingly interested in tapping
international markets, and have thus pursued a higher degree o f openness and transparency. The
number o f recent Russian IPOs i s impressive. In 2005, Russia witnessed a surge o f IPO activity
in both volume and value terms: 11 IPOs took place in 2005 raising total capital o f US$4.9
billion.
10.
Assuming that the Russian government sticks to its basic economic policies, the
Russian economy should continue to exhibit healthy growth throughout the CPS period. O i l
prices present the primary source o f uncertainty for both the pace and nature o f growth in the near
future. In the medium term, capacity constraints may increasingly limit the pace o f the economic
expansion while overall growth prospects continue to depend greatly on economic policy.
Particularly important are the maintenance o f macroeconomic stability, development o f
infrastructure, key social sector reforms (in education, healthcare and social services) and
measures to further improve the climate for private investment, competition, and
entrepreneurship. Growth prospects also depend on external factors other than oil. But as most
foreign inflows come from o i l and gas, Russia’s macroeconomic position i s not as vulnerable in

4

the short t e r m to changes in investor sentiment about emerging markets relative to most other
countries in the region. Annex 2 provides macroeconomic simulations for the Russian economy
during the period of t h i s CPS under alternative o i l price assumptions. In all o f these scenarios,
average GDP growth i s projected to fall in the range o f 4.5-6.8 percent

Growth since 1999 has been strongly pro-poor, and can be associated with rapidly
rising income, declining unemployment, and falling poverty rates. Real incomes o f the
population have been increasing faster than GDP, expanding by an estimated 86 percent between
1999 and 2005. The unemployment rate ( L O definition) continues to fall, reaching an estimated
7.6 percent in 2005 - down from over 12 percent in 1999. The recent World Bank Poverty
Assessment noted a reduction in the poverty headcount from 41.5 to 19.6 percent between 1999
and 2002, and subsequent official data suggests that these trends have continued through 2005.

The World Bank poverty monitoring confirms that economic growth and the
associated creation of higher-paying jobs have been the primary factors behind success in
poverty reduction. Indeed, working families with children have the highest incidence o f poverty
in Russia. In addition to higher-paying jobs created b y growth, increases in wages in the
budgetary sphere have had a positive impact on poverty reduction. However, i t w i l l be difficult
for Russia to maintain the pace o f poverty reduction established since 1999. The initial period
was a time o f recovery from an economic crisis that had temporarily increased poverty rates.
Although income inequality in Russia increased considerably during the first half o f the 1990s, it
has remained fairly stable in the last ten years, with a Gini coefficient o f roughly 0.4. This i s
considerably higher than in most European countries, yet lower than in the United States, Mexico,
and Brazil. Regional differentiation in poverty rates i s quite large, estimated in the Poverty
Assessment as ranging from 3.1 to 55.6, and recent trends in economic development suggest that
disparities in regional poverty rates, and consequently income inequality, could grow
significantly (See Annex 2). Many areas o f policy and reform are important here, including
measures to increase the mobility o f the population, social reforms in education and health, and a
revamping o f the current system o f social benefits for targeting the poor.

Russia has made progress toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals. As
a middle income country with well-developed public education and l o w child mortality, Russia
has already achieved or i s close to achieving some o f the Millennium Development Goals. The
primary areas of concern for meeting the MDGs in Russia are in the spread of infectious diseases
and environmental sustainability. A summary i s given below (Box 1).

Box 1. Russia and the Millennium Development Goals
The status o f Russia achieving the Millennium Development Goals can be summarized as follows:

On the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, Russia reduced absolute poverty (below US$2 a
day) to 6.3 percent in 2002 at the time o f the Poverty Assessment. I t has most likely declined even
further since then.
Universal primary education has already been virtually achieved in Russia with 97-98 percent of the
population receiving primary education.
On gender equality and the empowerment of women, Russia boasts indicators for education, health,
and social services that are comparable to those o f OECD countries. Still, discriminatory attitudes
toward women in the labor market are s t i l l problematic.
Child mortality fell to an estimated 11 per 1000 births in 2004, and maternal morbidity i s also
declining and well on track to meet the MDG goals.

HlV/AlDS i s not yet widespread in Russia, but i s nevertheless expanding at a rapid rate. The number
o f reported cases o f HIV quadrupled between 2000 and April, 2006, moving from less than 80,000 to a
reported 342,500 cases. The number o f cases o f TB more than doubled during the same period. In
addition, TB remains a serious challenge, and a high priority for the government.
Environmental degradation i s increasing in many areas in Russia along with economic growth.
Russia’s new policy priorities and National Projects in the social sphere may have a positive impact o n
remaining MDG challenges. Half o f the spending for the National Projects i s devoted to health, and
contains a specific HIV/AIDS-TB component. Yet a stronger national campaign w i l l most likely be
necessary to contain these epidemics. Environmental issues have not numbered among the government’s
primary priorities in recent years, but will no doubt require more attention as problems accumulate.

A number o f serious social problems in Russia are not fully reflected in the usual MDG breakdown.
Although average poverty rates have declined, concentrated pockets of severe poverty remain. While child
mortality has fallen, pre-mature adult mortality i s extremely high for a country o f Russia’s income level.
Average male l i f e expectancy in Russia i s only 59 years, as opposed to 72 for women. Thus, adult health in
Russia can also be considered a gender issue. The education system suffers from a number o f weaknesses
for a country o f Russia’s income level. See Annex 2 for a discussion o f these and other critical social
issues.

Regional Dimensions
15.
The 88 regions of the Russian Federation exhibit considerable geographic, ethnic,
economic and political diversity, and challenges in regional development are becoming
increasingly important. The factors that supported regionally broad-based growth since 1999 (a
weak ruble, cheap energy and labor, excess productive capacity) have now essentially
disappeared. Strong differences among Russian regions, reflecting the Soviet legacy o f

6

settlements that bear little relation to economic comparative advantage, suggest that regional
inequality w i l l likely become an increasingly acute problem. These problems are spelled out in
detail in Annex 2.

The Political Context
16.
The 2000s have witnessed a significant consolidation of power in Moscow. In this
context, an unprecedented degree o f political stability and cooperation between the federal
government, Parliament, and regional administrations has replaced the former environment o f
sharp political conflict and impasse. A trend toward the devolution o f power from Moscow to the
regions in the 1980s-1990s has been reversed. Since 2000, the government has pursued
initiatives to bring subnational legislation and policies in line with federal laws and priorities.
The most significant such measure was probably the introduction o f the direct presidential
appointment o f regional governors in 2004. While enhanced political stability and the role o f the
federal government offer advantages and opportunities for Russia, these developments can also
be associated with concerns in some circles that the growing political centralization and
government participation in the economy may be becoming excessive. Recent popular surveys
show a m i x o f both support and skepticism about current directions o f economic development and
policy (see Box 2).
Box 2: Recent surveys show mixed popular perceptions of government effectiveness
According to recent surveys, approval for President Putin i s very strong, with a current approval rating over
70 percent. I t quickly recovered from the slight decline in early 2005 in the wake o f an unpopular social
reform (the monetization of in-kind benefits) among other issues. On the subject o f recent economic
developments and public governance, opinions are much more reserved. H a l f o f the Russian citizens
believe that the current economic situation i s very mixed at best, and 59 percent hold the view that i t i s
impossible to run a “clean” business in the country. Similar doubts exist regarding the capability o f the
government to make good use o f the windfall o f oil revenues and tackle corruption in the public sector

17.
While the appetite for national reforms has weakened at the federal level, there is
increasing interest in launching major structural reforms as pilots or local initiatives in
selected regions, particularly in the area of public services.
A period o f relatively rapid
structural reform followed the 1998-99 financial crises. Subsequently, the rapid growth o f the
Russian economy, high o i l prices, and the virtual completion o f many “first generation” reforms
have understandably slowed the pace o f structural reform. An increasingly cautious attitude
toward reform in Moscow was reinforced by social unrest that followed the monetization o f
social benefits in early 2004. On the other hand, there remains political momentum behind some
previously launched national reforms, including local self-government, public administration,
budgetary reform, and electricity sector. Interest in Moscow for launching reforms at the
subnational level has been increasing. The appointment o f regional governors has eased fears on
potential conflicts o f interest in the delegation o f authority. The pre-election environment also
creates a premium for shifting responsibility for difficult social reforms to lower levels o f
government. Finally, as the 2005 monetization reform made apparent, Russian regions are
sufficiently heterogeneous to suggest that a single unified national approach to every reform may
not be optimal.
Russia has assumed a more prominent international role. I t hosted the G-8 in 2006,
18.
has completed the vast majority o f bilateral negotiations for WTO entry, has ratified the Kyoto
Protocol, and has been assuming increasing international obligations as an emerging donor.
Russia has recently joined the Multilateral Debt Reduction Initiative, and plans to write o f f
US$700 million o f debt in 16 enhanced HPIC countries in 2006. Part o f this debt write-off i s to

7

be directed toward high priority programs through a “debt for development swap”, in partnership
with various beneficiary countries in Africa and the World Bank. Russia has also agreed to
contribute to several international development partnerships, including the Avian Flu Trust Fund,
Education For AllEast Track Initiative, and the Global Village Energy Program. Russia has also
placed a strong priority on greater integration and cooperation within the CIS.

Key Development Challenges
19.
Despite the many recent positive developments in the Russian economy, the country’s
developmental challenges remain formidable. The investment climate in Russia s t i l l suffers
from uncertain property rights enforcement, inadequate competition, barriers to migration, and
problems in public governance. These problems find reflection in s t i l l l o w private investment
levels and a marked slowdown in the growth o f manufacturing in recent years. Their solution
becomes increasingly critical to maintaining rapid growth as capacity and labor supply constraints
increasingly bind in high growth regions and the ruble appreciates. Russia’s high dependence on
o i l and gas, coupled with relatively l o w average productivity in manufacturing, complicates the
realization o f diversified growth and the effective integration into world markets.
20.
A successful development strategy needs to address a highly complex set of
challenges.
They include remaining hurdles in economic transition to a market economy
(judiciary, regulatory institutions, etc.), issues common to developed market economies (such as
aging population, eradication o f poverty), problems stemming f i o m the dominance o f extractive
industries and the effects o f “Dutch Disease,” and Russia-specific tasks (more efficient
development o f i t s vast multi-ethnic territory, o f which a large part functions under harsh climatic
conditions).

21.
Russia’s primary development challenges are described in detail in Annex 2. Below
i s a summary o f key issues grouped into four categories: sustaining rapid growth; public
governance; provision of social services; and integrating Russia in the world economy.

A) Sustaining rapid growth
Maintaining macroeconomic stability in the context of large foreign inflows.
Macroeconomic stability remains critical for economic growth, and depends on
sterilizing a large part o f the current large foreign inflows through reserve accumulation.
Yet political and social pressures are mounting for a fiscal loosening.
Diversification. The economy remains highly dependent on o i l prices, economic growth
i s slowing notably in most “tradable” sectors o f the economy, and Russia has yet to
develop distinct comparative advantages in manufacturing. Continued upward pressure
on the real exchange rate from resource exports complicates the development o f these
comparative advantages.
Investment climate. The investment climate remains difficult, which particularly hinders
investment growth, the development o f entrepreneurship and a dynamic, diversified, and
knowledge-based economy. Although fixed capital investment has been growing notably,
i t i s s t i l l low (18 percent o f GDP) relative to other dynamic emerging market economies.
On the one hand, recent World Bank surveys indicate that, according to a number o f
business climate indicators (registration, taxation, customs, inspections) in Russia have
reached, or even surpassed, levels achieved in China and India. Nevertheless, despite
progress made in some areas the Russian business climate s t i l l suffers from weak
competition, a weak judiciary, the common capture o f markets at the regional level,
problematic access to land and premises, remaining uncertainty over property rights, and

8

various other administrative barriers. While Russia made rapid progress between 2000
and 2003 in improving the investment climate, the results have been much more mixed in
more recent years.
Russia’s rankings in the World Economic Forum Global
Competitiveness Report and Transparency International also declined notably in 2006
relative to 2005.
Infrastructure needs. Over the transition period, Russian infrastructure has deteriorated
and suffered from underinvestment.
Transportation bottlenecks are becoming
increasingly acute and there i s a growing concern about the availability and reliability o f
electricity supply. Strong economic growth has also created a rapidly growing demand
for infrastructure services. Shortages o f housing infrastructure limit migration flows that
are essential for sustaining rapid growth and poverty reduction
Labor supply. As the population shrinks and ages, labor supply, particularly skilled labor
supply, i s becoming an increasing constraint on economic growth. Training and
vocational education are inadequate. The dependence o f future growth on substantial
external migration poses difficult political and economic questions with respect to current
migration policy and i t s enforcement. The government has adopted a number o f recent
measures to promote and regulate effectively migration flows.
Financial intermediation. Russia’s banking sector remains small, dominated by stateowned banks, and potentially vulnerable to external shocks. Despite the impressive
growth o f Russia’s banking and financial sectors in recent years, external financial
constraints for Russian f i r m s continue to form important limiting factors to Russia’s
continued rapid expansion.
Environmental degradation. In recent years, environmental issues have not received top
political priority in Russia. As a result, accumulating environmental problems may
present growing threats in many areas. Both changes in federal administrative
arrangements and further decentralization o f environmental management can be
associated with increasing regional differentiation in the quality o f environmental
oversight. The current industrial expansion, increases in vehicle ownership, low energy
efficiency, and insufficient attention to the sustainable use o f Russia’s vast natural
resources, represent important environmental challenges that cannot be neglected.. . The
government i s now voicing concerns over the current lack o f clarity in arrangements for
natural resource protection and broader environmental oversight.

B) Public governance
Public administration. During the transition period, Russian civil service has suffered
from the Soviet legacy o f low pay, weak economic (performance based) incentives, and
an administrative apparatus riddled with inefficiencies and redundancies. The reform o f
public administration and the civil service has been a top priority for the government in
recent years, although progress has thus far been limited and mixed.
Intergovernmental fiscal relations. The Russian system o f intergovernmental fiscal
relations can be associated with distorted incentives and inefficiencies at lower levels o f
government. Reforms in fiscal federalism and local self-government are currently being
implemented in Russia, tackling a set o f important remaining challenges.
Judiciary. The Russian judiciary s t i l l suffers from l o w trust o f the population,
corruption, and limited capacity. Judicial reform has justifiably received more attention
from the government in recent years.

9

Anticorruption Efforts. Recent studies (including the Bank’s BEEPS survey) suggest
that the declining trend in corruption registered between 1999 and 2002 has been
reversed. A sharp increase in public revenues and in public investments at least partially
contributes to such trends, as in other countries with similar resource windfalls. The
issue o f corruption i s recognized as a priority at the highest levels o f Government and a
number o f anticorruption measures are being put in place. Anticorruption efforts are also
an important segment o f the administrative reforms agenda o f the Ministry o f Economic
Development and Trade and reflected in the Government’s Mid-Term Program.
Inclusion and civil society involvement. Civil society institutions are not fully
developed, and this presents a challenge to the process o f c i v i l engagement in decisionmaking, and in ensuring public accountability for all levels o f government. The
realization o f the current reform o f local-self government could play a critical role in
creating a foundation for the development o f grass roots c i v i l society.

C) The Social Sector and Social Services
Poverty and social services at the subnational level. The responsibility for most social
policy has been delegated to the regional and local levels. Yet huge regional inequalities,
regressive social assistance, and limited government capacity poses major challenges.
Extremely unfavorable demographic/health indicators and trends. For a middle
income country, Russia has exceptionally high indicators o f mortality and morbidity.
The threat o f AIDS and tuberculosis epidemics continues to grow. An ageing population
places an increasing burden on the pension and health systems.
Education. The public education system in Russia i s in need o f modernization and a
greater orientation toward the needs o f a modern market economy to improve the quality
o f school education and student’s learning outcomes in Russia.
Access to social services for the poor. Rapidly growing formal and informal costs of
quality health and education services place a particular burden on the poor. The Bank’s
recent Poverty Assessment and other studies show Russia’s social assistance system to be
one o f the most regressive among transition countries. Better measurement o f poverty
and i t s structure at the regional level w i l l be key tasks in moving forward.
Housing and communal services. Poorly developed markets in housing and communal
services represent barriers to welfare improvements and much needed migration.
Housing and communal service markets in Russia suffer from inadequate competition
and various regulatory distortions.
0)Russia’s Global Role and Integration into the World Economy
W T O accession and free trade agreements. Russia stands to profit significantly from
deeper integration into the world economy. In addition to the direct benefits from gains
from trade, rapid integration into the world economy offers the potential for rapid
institutional development, the improvement o f corporate governance and other standards,
and benefits from competition.
Emerging donor and G-8 member. Russia’s growing economic strength has boosted i t s
importance, and created a need for developing capacity, in i t s global roles as emerging
donor and G-8 member. The 2006 G8 Presidency granted Russia a unique opportunity

10

for active involvement in the policy dialogue on important global and regional issues, for
providing major inputs, and for taking the lead on specific themes and agendas.
Russia’s environmental significance on a global scale. Russia’s environmental
resources are o f national, regional, and global importance. Addressing issues like illegal
logging, biodiversity conservation and reduction o f carbon emissions can provide local
and global benefits.

The Medium-Term Social-Economic Program of the Russian Government
22.
Russia’s 2006-2008 Mid-term Program, approved in early 2006, addresses many of
the country’s most important development challenges. I t encompasses the main objectives of
“improving the welfare o f the population and reducing poverty through dynamic and sustained
growth and higher competitiveness.” The program embodies the strategic goal of doubling GDP
and cutting poverty in half in ten years as set b y President Putin and endorsed b y the Russian
Parliament. It reflects intensive debates over the right mix between building market institutions
and stimulating growth through public investments. The final mid-term program i s consistent
with the basic reform orientation of the f i r s t years o f Putin’s Presidency. I t advocates a
combination o f measures to promote private sector development and competition, the
improvement o f social services, and specific commitments to state investments in infrastructure
and diversification, including public-private partnerships, state investment funds, state
development banks and support for special economic zones and IT parks. Subsequent to the
adoption o f this program, President Putin’s annual address to the Federal Assembly placed
emphasis on some additional priorities, most notably reversing the problematic demographic
trends.
23.
The Government’s Program targets the key problems of the absence of incentives
and opportunities for the development of human capital, low efficiency of state governance,
low levels of competition and a high share of the %on-market economy,” weak diversification,
problems in the mobility of factors between regions, a low level of integration of Russia in the
world economy, infrastructure constraints, and an uneven record in reform at the subnational
level of government. Special priorities in the program are:
The realization of the four National Projects in health, education, housing, and
agriculture. These projects w i l l allocate a planned 382 billion rubles (US$ 14 billion
equivalent) in additional government money to these areas. The project in health
accounts for roughly half o f this spending, to be directed toward salary increases,
modernization o f equipment, and creation o f new health facilities. Additional resources
devoted to education w i l l go mostly toward pay increases, including incentive pay for
teachers, and grants for promising students. Much o f the national housing project offers
assistance to families for purchasing housing, either through redeemable certificates,
subsidized mortgages, or guarantees. The agriculture program also has a strong social
orientation, and consists largely o f various subsidies for farmers.
Increasing the efficiency of social policy, services and assistance. The Medium Term
Program also targets a number o f structural deficiencies in health, education, housing,
and social assistance. Priorities include developing performance-based budgeting to
measure and improve service delivery, increasing incentive pay for doctors and teachers,
reallocating resources toward preventive and primary care, reforming health insurance,
modernizing programs in education, expanding relevant professional training, facilitating
the entry o f private business in housing and communal services, developing targeted
social assistance, and realizing (revitalizing) pension reform.

11

The continuation of reforms in government administration and the civil service. The
new wave o f administrative reform expands the program to the regional level of
government. The primary current focus i s the introduction o f best practices in basic
organization, standardization, elimination o f redundancies, performance-based pay, as
well as measures to limit the unwarranted interference o f state bodies in economic affairs,
fight corruption, and disclose more information to the public. Concerns over corruption
have motivated more recent attention to this area. A comprehensive review i s underway
o f Russian legislation with an eye to correcting loopholes for corrupt practices.
Promoting competition, entrepreneurship, and diversification through measures to
strengthen market institutions, improve the business climate, and alleviate barriers to
the movement of capital between sectors. Specific measures concern the strengthening
o f property rights (disclosures, court protection), corporate governance (improving
standards, protection o f minority shareholders, disclosures), banking sector (improved
monitoring and tighter prudential norms to force mergers o f smaller banks), land and real
estate (cadastre, registration, privatization o f land under enterprises), taxation
privatization (requiring subnational governments to sell unitary enterprises and other
property), competition policy, and integration with the world economy.
Realizing the knowledge-based potential for growth and innovation in Russia. The
Program emphasizes a number of policy directions aimed at igniting the “innovation
economy” in Russia, including a greater state commitment to research and development,
better protection and enforcement o f intellectual property rights, and the formation o f I T
parks and state venture funds.
Alleviating infrastructure constraints to growth. The government i s increasing i t s own
financial commitment to building infrastructure, particularly in transportation, but also
plans to rely increasingly on Private Public Partnerships.
Realizing a transition in regional policy away from equalizing growth potential to
supporting points of economic growth. Government assistance in infrastructure and
finance w i l l prioritize areas with the potential to become or expand as growth points in
the economy. This includes the placement o f Special Economic Zones in high growth
areas. The welfare implications o f unequal regional development w i l l be met to a larger
degree through policies to promote migration to areas o f growth agglomerations.
Zmplementing effectively the ongoing far reaching reforms in inter-budgetary relations
and local self-government. The former delegate a much greater degree o f expenditure
autonomy to regions and localities, while leaving the determination o f the revenue side o f
subnational budgets quite centralized. The latter reform promises to transform local
municipalities into genuine budgetary entities with well-defined autonomy,
responsibility, property ownership, and electoral responsibilities to the population.

24.
Problems in demography and migration are receiving particular attention. This
became a primary point o f emphasis in President Putin’s address to the Federal Assembly o f May
2006. President Putin announced a plan that would substantially increase state child and
maternity support for families with two or more children and also called for measures to facilitate
legal migration to Russia from the former Soviet Union. The Medium-Term Program contains
proposals for simplifying registration and other procedures for legal migrants, as well as for
attracting highly qualified workers from abroad.

12

THE WORLD BANK GROUP’S PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY
Past Bank Assistance and Lessons from the Previous CAS
25.
The World Bank Group’s relaiionship with Russia has transformed over time, as the
Bank developed from a partner of necessity to a partner of choice. Russia joined the Bank in
1992, soon after the dissolution o f the Soviet Union and at the outset o f economic transition.
Broadly, the Bank’s focus has been on helping build the institutions o f a market economy,
developing the private sector, and mitigating the social costs o f transition. Since 1998 crisis,
Bank assistance moved towards support for public administration reform and anti-corruption,
budget management‘, tax collection; federal-regional fiscal relations; improvements in the
business environment; private sector investments; and rehabilitation o f education and health
systems with efforts to address the tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS crises. B y the time o f the 2002
CAS, the Bank’s relationship with Russia was already changing considerably. As the
government n o longer required budget support and was more interested in the Bank’s knowledge
and technical expertise, the 2002 CAS included a shift in emphasis toward more analytical and
advisory activities (AAA). At the same time, IFC and MIGA increased their involvement
considerably in line with growth o f the private sector. The attached CAS Completion Report
offers a more complete assessment o f the experience and lessons o f the implementation o f the
previous CAS. A summary i s given below.
26.
The design and implementation of the previous CAS closely followed the priorities of
the Russian Government, which strengthened ownership of the Bank program. In line with
Government’s medium-termprogram, the 2002 CAS focused Bank support to Russia along three
strategic pillars: (i)improving the business environment and enhancing competition, (ii)
strengthening public sector management; and (iii)
mitigating social and environmental risks. The
CAS also projected seventeen investment projects in support o f the three CAS pillars for a total
amount o f about US$1.8 billion. Given much higher government revenues due to rising o i l
prices, the actual lending volume was less than projected - ten projects totaling US$1.2 billion.
These projects, together with AAA and TA, helped the government realize key objectives in
budgetary reform (particularly at the regional level), land cadastre and registration, customs,
public administration, infrastructure, education, health, environment, and capacity building.
The Bank contributed to progress under each of the three strategic CAS pillars,
27.
although its role was not equally strong in all areas. On the first CAS pillar, improving the
business environment and enhancing competition, Bank instruments appropriately emphasized
AAA rather then lending, while World Bank Group direct support to the private sector expanded.
The Bank made considerable analytical contributions to economic development and investment
climate monitoring. While the accomplishments in these areas were significant, the structural
reform agenda for improving the business climate i s far from complete; administrative barriers to
business and investment remain significant, participation o f SMEs in the economy continues to be
low and progress in the area of natural monopolies has been limited. The Bank’s contribution to
the second CAS pillar, improving public sector management, has been significant. AAA focused
on federal functions where there was appetite both for reform and Bank support (tax, treasury,
customs and fiscal federalism). A relatively small volume o f lending resulted in a significant
scaled up impact. The goals o f the third pillar, mitigating social and environmental risks, were
expansive in scope and address issues that are long t e r m in nature - health care, education,
institutional care o f children, poverty reduction, and the Soviet environmental legacy. The

13

Bank’s efforts were more successful when focused on policy analysis and consensus building, or
responded to a clear government request such as in child welfare, adult health, HJY/AIDS,
poverty assessment and forestry studies.

A QAG review noted the very significant impact of the Bank’s AAA work during the
28.
CAS period. As noted, the CAS placed increased emphasis on AAA, which included a Country
Economic Memorandum, a Poverty Assessment, investment climate assessments (Administrative
barrier monitoring by FIAS, Business Environment and Economic Productivity Survey (BEEPS),
a study on the potential impact o f AIDS, fiduciary reports, policy notes, and sector reports. The
Bank also launched a regular publication, the Russian Economic Report, which made significant
contributions to the policy dialogue and public debate in Russia. A Q A G assessment
acknowledged the high quality o f the Bank’s independent judgment and perspectives, and i t s
success in bringing global knowledge to Russia. According to interviews with clients, many
changes in legislation, policies, design o f institutions, and practical measures reflected the
positive impact o f Bank analysis, advice or facilitation. Q A G rated the strategic relevance,
internal quality, and dialogue and dissemination o f Bank AAA in Russia as highly satisfactory.
Portfolio management has improved. The Bank portfolio as o f end-FY06 consists o f
29.
22 projects totaling US$1.9 billion in net commitments. Important steps were taken during the
CAS period to improve portfolio management and coordination, which focused on closing older
projects and improving quality at entry and exit (improving the “disconnect” on final project
ratings). A Bank-Government Joint Working Group (JWG) now regularly reviews portfolio and
project performance, including proposed project extensions, and decides on actions to address
significant problems and accelerate implementation. A number o f portfolio monitoring tools have
been created to track implementation of “next steps” agreed in missions’ aide-memories for both
ongoing projects and projects under preparation. Most recently an on-line procurement
monitoring system has been introduced that rates projects based on the timeliness o f procurement
steps under procurement packages. The Bank has strengthened supervision efforts through the
further decentralization o f operations, increasing communication with implementing agencies,
PIUs and relevant Government agencies. As a result, the share o f satisfactory projects has
improved and currently stands at 95 percent; well above the 77 percent satisfactory rating at the
start o f the CAS. Project implementation pace has picked up and the disbursement ratio
improved from an average 11 percent over the last 6 years to 15.7 percent in FY06.

30.
At the same time, portfolio management in Russia remains a challenging and
management-intensive task. Projects often require lengthy Government consideration prior to
approval and s t i l l take significantly longer to implement in the Russian context - the average
project age now stands at 4.8 years. Despite improvements, the disbursement pace trails the
Bank-wide and E C A averages o f 24.0 and 17.1 percent respectively in FY06. An action plan for
further strengthening portfolio quality includes: re-focusing the Bank-Government J W G on
outcomes and strategic decisions, including management o f closing dates; holding a strategic
country portfolio performance review; holding an annual review o f project Implementation Status
Reports with an emphasis on outcomes; moving further towards ministry-based project
implementation for new projects that leaves PIUs only with administrative and fiduciary
functions; and improved supervision practices. Further discussions are underway to simplify the
government grant approval procedure. On i t s side, the Bank i s also committed to continue i t s
efforts in expediting project preparation, decentralizing i t s operations, raising to the extent
possible the financial threshold per procurement methods and prior review thresholds, and
responding in an effective way to client’s needs.

31.
ZFC significantly increased its activities in Russia. IFC’s average commitment level
for the CAS period reached US$588 million per year, almost six times the FY00-02 average.
Russia i s now IFC’s largest country exposure, with a committed portfolio o f almost US$2 billion

14

as of end-FYO6. Investments in financial institutions represented b y far the largest share - about
half of new commitments. This reflects the objective stated in the previous CAS to increase
effective financial intermediation and opportunities for entry and growth o f new f i r m s . In line
with the diversification objectives of the CAS, manufacturing and services remained a significant
area o f focus with 26 percent o f new commitments. In infrastructure, transport became a
significant new sector for I F C in Russia with nine investments in private companies (all Russianowned), operating in rail, sea, and air transport. The remainder o f new commitments went to the
oil, chemical and mining sectors, agribusiness, and IT/media, and funds. In general, a
significantly increasing portion o f IFC’s financing went to funding Russian-owned companies.
32.
ZFC continued providing technical assistance through the Moscow-based Private
Enterprise Partnership (PEP) to promote the development of Russia’s private sector. During
the CAS period, IFC completed a large program in corporate governance, through which i t
supported 2,000 companies in improving their corporate governance practices. On the national
level, the program worked with Russia’s Federal Securities Commission to draft and disseminate
Russia’s first national corporate governance code and with the Russian Parliament on different
laws and regulations related to corporate governance. This work was done in coordination with
the Bank, OECD, and the Global Corporate Governance Forum. The program also sought to
raise public awareness o f the importance o f good corporate governance and the protection o f
shareholders’ rights and worked with educational institutions to introduce corporate governance
topics into law and management courses.
33.
The Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FZAS), a joint unit of ZFC and the World
Bank, increased its specialized assistance in monitoring the investment climate of Russia.
Following a series o f comprehensive diagnostics o f administrative barriers for business start up,
locating and operating procedures in 12 regions o f Russia which demonstrated that the most
important constraint was related to access to commercial land and real estate, FIAS focused on
strengthening o f transparent and defensible property rights for immovable assets for businesses.
On the national level, FIAS i s assisting the Ministry o f Economic Development and Trade in
drafting the law on privatization o f plots o f land under privately-owned buildings. On the subnational level, assistance i s being provided to the 12 regions and municipalities covered by FIAS
aimed at lowing barriers in land and real estate transactions.
MZGA has also increased its activities in Russia. Russia i s currently MIGA’s largest
34.
country exposure. As o f June 30, 2006, the Agency’s gross exposure in Russia was about
US$536 million (equivalent to 10.0 percent o f MIGA’s gross portfolio), and i t s net exposure
amounted to nearly US$211 million (about 6.4 percent o f total net exposure). As o f June 30,
2006, MIGA’s outstanding portfolio in Russia consisted o f 15 contracts o f guarantee in the
financial, water supply, mining, manufacturing and agribusiness sectors. The Agency also
supported various regions in strengthening their investment promotion capacity.

35.
A number of lessons emerge from the implementation of the previous CAS, with
implications for design and implementation of the new strategy: (i)in view o f Russia’s large
fiscal surplus, the Bank’s value added i s not in providing financial support but rather in helping
Russia gain access to global knowledge and s k i l l s through analytical and advisory support and
through bringing together different stakeholders and parts o f government in forging consensus on
given Russia’s rapidly changing environment, the Bank should continue to
key policy issues; (ii)
move towards a partnership approach with a strong demand-orientation in design and delivery o f
assistance and flexibility in adjusting the Bank’s program and modalities o f assistance to client
needs, making full use o f the Bank’s flexible arrangements for well performing M I C s and
spearheading new instruments o f assistance which also draw on increased collaboration with IFC
and MIGA; (iii)with the growing gap between prosperous and lagging regions, the major
challenge for the Bank i s to address the development challenges at the sub-national and regional

15

levels; (iv) given Russia’s enormous size, measures to increase the Bank’s impact through
enhanced dissemination, outreach and scaling up w i l l be important; (v) recent progress in
improving portfolio quality and speeding up implementation has been encouraging, but both the
Bank and the Russian authorities w i l l need to be diligent in staying the course given Russia’s
difficult operating environment (bureaucracy, slow decision making); (vi) Russia w i l l continue to
be a high cost country in which to operate, which reflects Russia’s size, the significant time taken
to build consensus on future policies, and the slow pace o f government decision-making
involving multiple reviews o f new projects and delays in project implementation. At the same
time, Government counterparts often prefer long-term Bank engagement on projects to prolong
the use o f Bank s k i l l s on project management and technical expertise; and (vii) decentralization
has improved both the quality and timeliness o f the Bank’s work in Russia and should be
sustained in future operations - particularly as our work in the Russian regions intensifies.

The Rationale for Future Cooperation
36.

The World Bank Group’s current relations with Russia are unique. I t has been a
partner to Russia in i t s gaining a more prominent global role as emerging donor and G-8 chair.
The Bank has also been coordinating and implementing substantial donor programs in poorer
regions and elsewhere in Russia. The reasons for the unique and special relations lie in both the
history o f Bank-Russia engagement, and in Russia’s rapidly changing economic conditions and
growing global role. The Bank continues to be viewed b y the government as an important
credible and neutral partner in economic development. The Bank Group’s programs in Russia,
despite many challenges in implementation, enjoy a high degree o f ownership. While the strong
fiscal position o f the federal government limits i t s borrowing needs, the country’s immense
regional diversity and remaining development challenges speak for the expedience o f maintaining
cooperation with the Bank in many areas. The Bank i s also uniquely positioned to facilitate
Russia’s growing role in the donor community. As the private sector in Russia has expanded, so
have the opportunities for constructive engagement by IFC and MIGA.

37.
The rapidly evolving economic and political situation in Russia has necessitated a
transition to new modalities of cooperation. No longer needing external financing, the federal
government i s demanding new and more diversified services in accordance with its status as one
o f the most sophisticated M I C clients of the Bank Group. The success with which the Bank and
the Russian government can deepen relations on the basis o f new modalities o f operation have
significance not only for the Russia program, but for the overall emerging strategy o f the Bank
for work in middle income countries. Russia i s an example o f a middle income country that has
major significance for the entire E C A region, and can provide many lessons o f value for
developing and transition countries throughout the world.
38.
Relations between the World Bank and Russia are already in transition, and this
transition will continue throughout the CPS period. Consistent with current trends in the
Bank’s operations in Russia, future relations w i l l be built primarily upon (i)the Bank’s
independent “on-time” policy advice on important issues facing the country; (ii)assistance in
management o f projects or public investments in priority areas without high lending amounts;
(iii)
continued strong levels o f financing to the private sector, and increased financing to regional
governments without sovereign guarantees, and (iv) the development o f fee-for-service
arrangements for the provision o f technical and analytical work. The strategy o f this CPS i s
designed to support the completion of the current transition.

39.
The government recognizes that the World Bank has comparative advantages in
many areas that have high relevance for Russia. During its 13 year history o f engagement in
Russia, the Bank has developed a significant capacity for bringing extensive knowledge and
experience to bear in the country. This includes analytical work that places the Russian

16

experience in international perspective, institutional development in the private sector, public
sector governance, and project management s k i l l s that remain valuable in the country at a time
when the government itself i s just beginning to develop capacity for multi-year project
development, finance, and implementation. As a source o f experience and knowledge, the World
Bank engages in regular extensive monitoring o f structural issues, and holds the most extensive
databases on investment climate issues, governance, and private-public partnerships. The Bank
has enormous relevant experience in the design and implementation o f infrastructure projects, and
in building governance and budgeting capacity at the central and subnational levels o f
government. Finally, the Bank plays a leading role worldwide in the donor community, as well
as in addressing global challenges as climate change, biodiversity, and infectious diseases.
Annex 3 describes the Bank’s comparative advantages in more detail.
Principles of Engagement and Modalities of Cooperation

40.
Bank support will be demand-driven and flexible within a strategic framework that
reflects the government’s medium-term program, and also builds on the Bank’s agenda for
well-performing MZCs.’ Accordingly, key principles that w i l l drive the orientation o f Bank
a strong demand orientation and flexibility o f
programs in Russia over the coming years are: (i)
support for priority activities
the Bank program in response to Russia’s evolving needs; (ii)
addressing Russia’s key development challenges in accordance with the CPS strategic
framework; (iii)
use o f the comparative advantages o f the three parts o f the World Bank Group
(IBRD, I F C and MIGA), while further increasing their collaboration; (iv) support for systemic
solutions with lasting impact on institutional capacity and potential for scaling up; (v) balancing
federal level cooperation with selective, but increasingly deep, engagement with a small group o f
Russian regions and municipalities; (vi) leveraging scarce Bank resources with Russia’s own
budgetary resources, particularly as Bank lending volumes decrease; and (vii) effective
partnerships with Russian institutions, including the private sector, think-tanks and c i v i l society
organizations, as well as with external partners (EBRD, OECD, the UN system, and bilateral
donors with active programs in Russia). The Bank’s lending and non-lending activities w i l l be
assessed as part of an annual consultation process with government in the context o f
government’s budget formulation process which also sets out Russia’s borrowing program for the
coming year. Selection o f activities for Bank support w i l l be guided by government’s demand for
Bank services, the above key principles for Bank engagement, and the Bank’s capacity to respond
to new assistance demands.
41.
The current dynamics of the Bank’s program is characterized by a gradual shift
towards new modalities of operation and instruments. Without introduction o f such new
modalities and instruments, given Russia’s ample fiscal surpluses, future Bank lending, would be
highly limited. At the same time, a program based on developing new modalities o f cooperation
as envisaged in the CPS can expand and compensate for a shrinking traditional core program. As
the Bank and the Government work towards resolving issues currently impeding wider
application o f proposed new instruments as discussed below, the Bank program in Russia would
evolve into an “expanded” scenario. In this scenario, the Bank program would be shifting
towards greater use of “new instruments”, which in turn could form the new core o f Bank
activities in the post-CPS period. Thus, the CPS offers a flexible, yet cautious approach for Bank
operations, mainly focusing on traditional instruments for a core program o f activities in line with
the planned available resource envelope for Russia, while investing limited resources into
developing new areas o f cooperation under the new instruments.

* 1 The CPS supports the major tenets of the Bank’s recently approved strategy for engagement with Middle

Income Countries entitled “Strengthening the World Bank’s Engagement with IBRD Partner Countries”,
September 2006.

17

42.
The I B R D program for the period of the CPS can be viewed as a combination of
certain (shrinking) core activities that would be maintained even under a “low case” scenario
of engagement, and expanded activities that depend on new business opportunities and
modalities. The degree to which new business opportunities substitute for traditional lending to
the federal government over the period o f the CPS w i l l depend on the political and economic
environment in the country. In the event that this environment w i l l be less conducive than
expected to the creation and expansion of new modalities o f operation, core activities w i l l shrink
over the period o f the CPS, and the post-CPS role o f the IBRD could be reduced primarily to
servicing Russia as an emerging donor and shareholder; At the same time, IFC and MIGA w i l l
continue their significant engagement in support o f the private sector and foreign investment.
43.
The CPS builds on the important adjustments already made to the Bank’s program
in Russia to facilitate a full transition to new modalities of operation. Recent projects with the
federal government have involved a higher share o f Government financing (e.g. Hydromet,
Cadastre), while other such projects are in preparation. Bank activities have been moving
increasingly to the regional level. The Bank has begun a special program o f assistance to the
Southern Federal Okrug. The focus o f much o f the Bank’s TA and AAA work, including the
Country Economic Memorandum, has shifted to the regional and local levels. The first subnational project without a sovereign guarantee, developed in cooperation between I F C and the
Bank, was recently approved for the Chuvashia Republic. A fee-for-service TA assignment for a
PPP highway project was implemented with the city o f Saint Petersburg. A special AAA
Advisory Council was created in 2005, consisting o f the leaders o f prominent Moscow and Saint
Petersburg think tanks. This Council gives advice on, and critical evaluations of, the Banks AAA
work, and facilitates the establishment o f joint projects. The Bank has conducted a significant
restructuring o f i t s Moscow office, including a realignment o f skills, further decentralization of
decision-making, enhanced multi-sectoral cooperation, and the introduction o f an internship
program for graduate students from Russian universities. T o support i t s enlarged program, IFC
has increased capacity in the field to improve client responsiveness and has organized the
Moscow office along sectoral lines to ensure a comprehensive view on each sector o f interest.
44.
Focused engagement in selected regions and high eo-financing in federal projects
also provide opportunities for scaling up and maximizing the impact of the Bank’s resources.
Successful cooperation at the regional level though integrated programs that includes general
analysis, diagnostics, and operations would provide models that can be expanded to other regions
at a later date, with or without the direct participation o f the Bank. In some areas the assistance
that the Bank can offer the regions already represents a scaling up o f lessons and experience o f
Bank cooperation at the federal level. Also, high co-financing o f federal projects allows for their
expansion beyond what Bank resources alone would deliver. Recently, the government has
increased i t s co-financing o f a number o f on-going projects as a means o f scaling up the project’s
scope or range.
The Bank’s AAA work aims to ensure continued capacity to contribute to important
policy debates in the country, both in regards to domestic issues and Russia’s global role. The
Bank has successfully served as a depository o f international experience for the highest level o f
government on various issues. The government has profited from analytical work in many areas,
and has referred to the Bank for advice (in,the form o f both in-depth diagnostic reports and brief
notes) on issues ranging from implications o f various tax policies, establishment o f domestic
development institutions, and arrangements for donor funding. Providing high quality advisory
services w i l l be essential to the Bank’s value to Russia in a time when the government and
Russian think tanks are demanding more specific and nuanced international expertise. As such
inquiries are expected to continue, the Bank aims to maintain a minimum program o f core
diagnostic AAA along the lines o f economic monitoring (Russian economic report, poverty work,
strategic sector dialogue), and advisory services in low-income regions to the extent possible.

45.

18

Regional AAA i s expected in developing regional strategies and local investment climate
assessments, especially for regions where the Bank Group may be expanding i t s lending services.
In the interest o f strengthening government capacity, “staff secondment” arrangements to engage
Russian experts more actively in the Bank’s work in other client countries and international
events are envisaged. In addition, WBI w i l l continue to support Bank work with specific capacity
building activities in the regions (see below).
46.
As in other well-performing MICs, AAA work is expected to move increasingly
towards reimbursable fee-for-service arrangements. T o continue delivery o f a comprehensive
analytical and advisory program, the Bank w i l l work with federal and regional authorities in
moving towards a more streamlined approach in developing such fee-for-service arrangements
along the lines o f developments in other well-performing MICs, including the signing o f a
framework agreement between the Bank and government that would include principles o f cost
recovery. Under this instrument, the Bank reaches agreement with a non-commercial entity to
deliver analytical work on a fee-for-service basis. The assistance would include knowledge
transfer in the interest of developing local capacity. The Bank would only offer such services if
the requested expertise i s not available in the market. A large part o f reimbursable TA provided
by the Bank in various countries has involved consultative services for large-scale infrastructure
investments, especially those based on private-public partnerships. The first such experience in
Russia was with the City o f St. Petersburg for construction o f the high-speed diameter ring-road.
Initial discussions with various regions suggest interest in other types o f work in addition to
public investment projects, including diagnostics o f regional growth and economic
competitiveness, investment climate monitoring and benchmarking, reforms in the social sector,
and asset management services. The scope o f the Bank’s “reimbursable TA” program in Russia
could reach about US$1 million per year towards the second half o f the CPS period.

47.
Along the same lines, the Bank and the government are developing an instrument to
allow the application of the Bank’s project design and management skills to federal projects
without Bank lending. While projects in the current pipeline are being developed with a high
share of financing by the Russian government, even this approach has important drawbacks in the
current Russian political context in the light o f huge fiscal surpluses. Given the Government’s
interest in tapping the Bank‘s s k i l l s in project design and management, a new instrument i s being
jointly considered that would provide such s k i l l s for government financed programs and projects
on a fee-for-service basis. I t would allow Bank advisory support in a larger number o f
government programs - either at the federal level or in regions on the basis o f federal funding.
Such instrument must accommodate the Bank’s fiduciary policies and preempt possible
reputation risks. In general the Bank and the government w i l l continue discussions for
developing additional instruments that can both exploit the Bank’s experience and knowledge
without much reliance on federal borrowing.
48.
The World Bank Group intends to maintain current levels of finance for the private
sector and expand regional lending without sovereign guarantees. IFC and MIGA w i l l
maintain strong support for private sector development b y focusing on priority areas aligned with
overall Bank Group strategy, in particular investments in financial institutions, infrastructure, and
services and production where Russia has a competitive advantage, or where investment w i l l
contribute to the diversification o f the economy. IFC w i l l continue to emphasize the development
o f good corporate governance in it investments, and an increasing area o f focus in both
investment and advisory work w i l l be environmental sustainability. In addition, it i s expected
that the new joint IFC/Bank Sub-National Development Program w i l l finance 1-3 projects (about
US$25-100 million) per year in support o f mainly infrastructure investments in creditworthy
regions and public utilities. Care would be taken that such sub-national projects are in line with
federal priorities and fiscal considerations, and based on prior consultations with federal

19

authorities for each such proposed transaction. Box 3 provides further details on the IFC/Bank
Sub-National Development Program.

Box 3: The Joint IFC/Bank Sub-National Development Program
The joint IFC/Bank Sub-National Development Program offers a new financial instrument: sub-national
loans without sovereign guarantees. The Bank Group responded to the demand for such new sub-national
financial products in 2003 by establishing a Municipal Fund within IFC. In June 2006, the Bank’s
Executive Director approved a Joint I F C B a n k Sub-National Development Program that builds on the
experience o f the Municipal Fund and similar initiatives o f other IFIs. The Program taps into the
comparative advantages o f IBRD in supporting reforms o f local government, utilities, investment planning,
and public expenditure management, and IFC’s experience in managing a diverse set o f financial
instruments and investment operations. Thus, the Program provides technical assistance for financial
management, support o f reforms, public investment through provision o f guarantees, loans, or equity
finance, mainly in local currency. The Program has been approved for a three-year pilot period, coinciding
with the CPS, with commitments o f US$800 million for financing and US$6 million for technical
assistance. The Program i s to be managed jointly by the IBRD and IFC. A first sub-national operation in
Russia has been approved, and a number o f other proposals from regions are currently under discussion. I t
i s expected that lending from the Program in Russia w i l l amount to about US$25-100 million per year
during the CPS period. The highest demand for sub-national financing would be for capital investments in
municipal or rural infrastructure and utilities, with some regions interested in other sectors, such as tourism
or forestry.

49.
The administration of grants and development of the carbon market could also
become important parts of the Bank’s activities in Russia, provided processing at the federal
level can be accelerated. With the introduction of the GEF Resource Allocation Framework in
2006, Russia could access a country allocation of about US$50 million in the climate change
focal area and US$lO-20 million in the biodiversity focal area during the 2006-2010 GEF
replenishment period, as well as additional funds for other areas. The Bank’s Post-Conflict Grant
Facility also offers development opportunities to conflict-affected territories (e.g. the Northern
Caucasuses). Federal processing o f such grants has been slow, and w i l l require more efficient
procedures for preparation, approval, and monitoring o f grants at the national level, along with
mechanisms for joint implementation and supervision of grants by federal and regional
authorities. Russia has significant potential opportunities for tapping into the carbon market, both
in the use o f i t s existing carbon allocation and through a “green investment scheme” for
expanding i t s allocation. Lending to regions and the private sector could be combined with
carbon finance revenues, which would make Bank financing even more attractive and provide
incentives for the adoption o f low-carbon technologies for increasing energy efficiency.
Bank Instruments by Clients

50.
There are four main “constituency” groups for Bank assistance in Russia: (i)
the
federal government, sectoral ministries and agencies, which value the Bank’s overall assistance,
including that in global affairs and the support o f Russia’s expanding donor role; as well as the
Bank’s sectoral knowledge both in regards to formulation o f important policies and
regional governments, which want
implementation o f long term public investment programs; (ii)
to cooperate with the Bank on both developing their reform agendas and accessing the Bank’s
the private sector, which receives financial and technical assistance from
financing products; (iii)
IFC and guarantees from MIGA for expanding operations in Russia and abroad; and (iv) Russian
think tanks, experts, and NGO community, which highly value the Bank’s independent opinion
on important policy and reform processes in the country, and access the Bank’s international
knowledge and experience. The Bank’s program over the CPS period w i l l seek to address key
needs o f these groups o f Russian clients b y using a broad array o f instruments as shown in the

20

following table and elaborated below. In the course o f current discussions between the Russian
government and the Bank, additional new instruments could also materialize during the period of
the CPS.

Conventional AAA: Continued analytical work in partnership with local think tanks to the
Government and ministries on the state o f the economy; important policy and sector issues; and
on priority areas for poor regions.
Reimbursable TA: Additional analytical work and technical assistance can be provided by the
Bank on reimbursable basis including preparation o f strategies and sector analyses for regions;
technical support for specific investment activities (e.g. PPPs in infrastructure, projects
supported by the Investment Fund, etc.). Special reimbursable TA arrangements are foreseen
to provide Bank advice on project design and management for investment projects fully funded
by the Federal and regional governments.
Assistance to the Government in transformation to a donor country: Includes short notes
in the framework o f G8 process, and TA on exposing Russian experts to the international aid
architecture and instruments.
IFC technical assistance: Primarily through FIAS and the Private Enterprise Partnership
(PEP), IFC w i l l continue to support improvements to the business enabling environment, the
introduction o f new products in the financial sector (e.g. housing finance and securitization),
the promotion o f socially and environmentally sustainable development (e.g. through work to
support occupational health, community and SME development around large investments,
financing o f energy efficiency, and cleaner production).

21

(ii) Financing and Guarantees

Conventional IBRD loans with large share of Government co-financing: Limited number
o f IBRD Loans with high-level o f co-financing by the government. The focus w i l l be on
piloting innovative mechanisms that can be later scaled up using federal funding and for
supporting priority operations in regions with weaker financial performance.
IFC and M I G A support to the private sector: I F C and MIGA w i l l continue their strong
levels o f investment and guarantee operations, with increased focus on regions beyond
Moscow. IFC w i l l support the increased deepening o f the financial sector through support to
the development o f other sources o f financing, including municipal bonds, securitizations, and
increased local currency financing.
Partial Risk Guarantees: A few IBRD PRGs are expected, especially in the infrastructure
sector.
Subnational Loans: One to three subnational projects a year could be developed without
sovereign guarantees, primarily focusing on regional infrastructure. Sub-sovereign lending by
the Bank Group’s Sub-National Development Program w i l l be aimed at creditworthy regions.
Grants: One to three GEF, Post Conflict, or other grants during the CPS period could be
prepared for Federal or regional governments for meeting global commitments (a grant request
for US$20 million for a Renewable Energy project i s under preparation).
Carbon Finance: A number o f carbon finance projects could be prepared a year benefiting
private businesses, utilities, or municipalities for improving energy efficiency and meeting
global commitments under the Kyoto protocol.
(iii) Special Services

WBI capacity-building activities: WBI’s programs w i l l combine learning programs and
training courses with TA programs designed and delivered together with the Russia country
team. B o x 4 provides further details.
Asset Management: The Bank’s Treasury can provide i t s technical assistance on asset
management for better management o f Russia’s o i l revenues on federal or regional levels,
based on introduction o f appropriate legal instruments.
Bank’s Trust Funds Mechanisms: The Government plans to use the Bank’s TF mechanisms
for delivery o f i t s aid commitments as Russia’s donor role expands.

I

Box 4: WBI capacity-building activities
During FYO7-09, W B I expects to maintain an active demand-based capacity building program in Russia.
WBI’s programs will combine learning programs and training courses with T A programs designed and
delivered together with the Russia country team. Programs will be multi-year and closely aligned with the
analytical work o f the Bank and TA activities o f FIAS and IFC. Provision w i l l also be made to allow for
rapid response to emerging areas o f key strategic significance, identified jointly with the Country Director
and country team. Design and delivery of WBI’s programs benefit from excellent Bank and local partner
relationships. In support o f the Banks focus on regions, WBI i s already paying closer attention to capacity
building in the Southern Okrug, working with the various levels o f government and with broad sections o f
the society, including local and international partners. WBI will continue to play an important role in
supporting dissemination o f Bank reports and in creating a platform for policy dialogue, reform and
consensus building in important areas such as increased governance in the public sector particularly at the
municipal level, support to SME development, trade and the W T O agenda, and improving competitiveness
and investment climate in Russia.

51.

I

I n order to fully utilize the various instruments described above, the Bank and
Government need to take a number of actions, including (i)
synchronization o f the Banks and
government’s procedures for preparation and implementation o f IBRD loans and grants, (ii)

22

clarification of procedures for preparation and approval o f subnational loans and o f the Banks
advisory services on a reimbursable basis, and (iii)
the establishment o f a regulatory framework
for the implementation o f Kyoto-related mechanisms. A process i s in place to address these
issues, engaging the relevant Russian authorities and representatives o f the Bank. The speed and
scale of resolving them w i l l have implications for the size and composition o f the program.

Strategic Priorities for the CPS
52.
The World Bank Group’s program for the coming years will be guided by the
priorities of Russia’s medium-term program, and be directed at areas where the Bank’s
comparative advantages can help in addressing Russia’s outstanding development challenges.
Accordingly, the strategic priorities for the CPS correspond closely to the pillars o f the previous
CAS in supporting Russia’s overall goal o f improving the well being o f i t s population and
decreasing poverty, which w i l l be realized primarily through dynamic and sustained economic
growth and a more competitive economy. In support o f this overall country goal, the bulk o f
World Bank Group activities in Russia over the coming three years w i l l be directed to achieve
progress in four areas: (i)
sustaining rapid growth (including diversification) (ii)
improving public
sector management and governance; (iii)improving the delivery of social and communal
services, and (iv) enhancing Russia’s global role. The World Bank Group’s involvement in all o f
these areas would correspond to i t s specific comparative advantages, as noted above (also see
Annex 3).
53.
Given the need for significant flexibility in Bank cooperation in Russia, the Country
Partnership Strategy outlines a broad menu of activities that may become focal points of the
program during 2006-2009 at both the federal and sub-national levels. Not all o f these
activities or operations w i l l likely be implemented during the CPS period. The actual program
w i l l depend on how demand for and supply o f Bank s k i l l s and services correlate, as well as on
progress in addressing current constrains on both sides in the development and application o f new
instruments. The broad strategic framework for Bank involvement i s in the following Figure.
Bank involvement in each o f the strategic pillars i s discussed below. As shown, the Bank’s
growing activities in the regions would be guided by the first three pillars o f the strategic
framework which also apply to the Bank’s federal level involvement. The indicative outcomes of
this involvement are set out in the attached results matrix (Annex 4).

Sustaining Rapid Growth

54.
The World Bank Group will assist Russia in various ways in meeting the challenges
of sustaining rapid growth. This includes active participation in macro-policy debates,
monitoring the investment climate, supporting public investment and PPPs for growth and

diversification, working with regions to identify and overcome barriers to growth, supporting
investments in priority areas at the regional level, and providing direct assistance to the private
sector:
Macroeconomic policy and the effective management of Russia’s large external
inflows: The Bank w i l l contribute to the macro-policy debate in Russia through the
Russian Economic Report, on-demand policy notes and knowledge sharing. Advisory
services can include training and impact monitoring activities related to W T O accession.
In addition, there i s strong interest in the Bank’s technical assistance in advising on
alternative uses for the windfall o i l revenues, including the development o f an
institutional framework for the effective management o f a growing diversified portfolio
o f foreign assets. The World Bank Treasury has experience and expertise that can be
valuable to Russia in this area and has held initial discussions with the authorities on
possible support.
Investment climate monitoring and policy advice: The Bank w i l l continue periodic
BEEPS surveys, regional investment climate assessments, and administrative barriers
studies undertaken by FIAS for interested regions. The Bank and MIGA can work at the
regional level on capacity building and the development o f investment promotion
programs for attracting FDI, similar to the initiative currently underway in Rostov
Region. WBI w i l l continue capacity-building activities related to investment climate
assessments.
Supporting Government investment and PPPs for growth and diversification: Two
separate projects in support of developing Special Economic Zones and IT Parks (both in
FY07) have the goal o f promoting the diversification and the agglomeration o f economic
activities in Russia. A microfinance infrastructure development project (FY08) focuses
on financial cooperatives and their integration into the financial system o f the country.
On-going investment projects support land registration and the development of a national
cadastre for securing property rights and the development of land markets. Possible
partial risk guarantees o f the Bank to the power sector could help attract investment to the
electricity sector for modernization and substantial increases in capacity. And another
partial risk guarantee instrument may be used to support the construction o f an aluminum
complex (SUAL) in Russia’s K o m i Republic, possibly alongside an IFC investment in
the aluminum complex. Other areas for possible IBRD projects relevant to sustaining
rapid growth include support for science and technology development, modernization o f
the chemical sector, and forestry. In addition, regular and reimbursable TAs w i l l support
development o f PPPs across sectors.
Working with regions to identifv engines of growth, develop growth strategies, and
remove barriers to growth: The Bank w i l l continue thematic Country Economic
Memorandum focused on relieving barriers to growth at the subnational level and on
questions o f regional agglomerations. The development o f fee-for-service arrangements
with the regions would provide another promising avenue for supporting preparation o f

24

regional investment strategies and growth analyses, and provision o f other analytical
services.
Supporting investments in priority areas at the regional level: The I F C B a n k SubNational Development Program w i l l support important regional public investments. The
government i s particularly keen on developing this financing mechanism further, as it
involves direct lending to well-performing regions and municipalities without sovereign
guarantees. One to three such sub-national operations per year are contemplated over the
CPS. Infrastructure i s also an important area o f I F C investments. This concerns
primarily transport and logistics, but also includes municipal infrastructure. MIGA can
play a role in supporting foreign direct investment in infrastructure at the sub-sovereign
level, including in the water and solid waste sectors.
Providing direct support to the private sector: I F C w i l l continue to support Russia’s
private sector growth agenda through a combination o f financial and advisory services to
promote the growth of the private sector and the diversification o f the Russian economy.
IFC w i l l finance projects (1) with important spill-over effects to other companies, such as
infrastructure and financial markets, (2) in sectors where Russia may have a comparative
advantage, for example the processing o f natural resources and those that promote the
knowledge economy, and (3) those increasing the range and quality of products and
services available in the Russian market, particularly outside o f Moscow. I F C w i l l
increasingly look for opportunities to participate in equity financing. In the real sector -including infrastructure, extractive industries, manufacturing, high-tech, media./IT, and
agribusiness -- IFC w i l l continue to support mid-sized local companies without other
access to long-term financing. Even with larger corporates, IFC has a role in selected
projects where there are key environmental and social issues and scope to improve
corporate governance practices. Much o f IFC’ s activities w i l l remain concentrated in the
financial sector, where priorities w i l l be:

building long-term relationships with medium-sized independent private regional
banks, so as to increase competition and the range o f services available to the
population. IFC financing, provided in the form o f long-term senior loans and, in
selected cases, subordinated loans, w i l l help to strengthen the banks’ balance
sheets, reach new clients (including SMEs), attract more depositors, and
consolidate their position as leading regional banks;
supporting the introduction o f specialized banking products, including mortgage
financing, consumer finance and leasing;
supporting the process o f privatization o f state-owned banks, as and when
requested by the Russian Government; and
supporting development and use o f new financial instruments, such as partial
guarantees of local currency bonds and securitization.
Continuing I F C advisory work through the Private Enterprise Partnership and FIAS:
This technical assistance w i l l address the following objectives: (a) increasing the
development impact of investments through strengthening local suppliers and engaging in
community development work around large investments; (b) building the capacity o f
private banks to deliver new product lines, such as mortgage finance and financing for
energy efficiency; and (c) improving corporate governance and environmental
sustainability through work with banks and real sector clients, including IFC investees.
FIAS w i l l continue to work with select regions to improve the business climate by
assisting in implementation o f policies/instruments to kick-start functioning markets of
land and commercial real estate. Other opportunities for FIAS to support improvements
in the business climate include: mainstreaming Doing Business indicators in Russia on

25

the sub-national level; piloting Municipal Scorecards; land and real estate monitoring;
regulatory and administrative simplification activities, including on a fee-for-service
basis in better-off Russia’s regions; and implementing market-based Corporate Social
Responsibility activities in sectors o f global importance (e.g., promoting sustainable
forest management by assisting in introduction o f voluntary certification schemes).
MZGA will continue to support foreign investors through the provision of political risk
guarantees: Supporting foreign investment in infrastructure, in close coordination with
the Bank, w i l l remain an important area o f MIGA’s activity in Russia. In the financial
sector, the Agency w i l l continue to explore opportunities to support capital markets
transactions, including asset-backed securitizations. MIGA may also continue to promote
the role and assist in the expansion of foreign banks in the Russian banking sector. Areas
for potential further involvement in Russia include the manufacturing, agribusiness and
services sectors.
Improving Public Sector Management and Performance

55.

Public sector management has been a particular area of strength of World Bank
work in Russia, which will be further deepened in coming years. The Bank w i l l remain
engaged in supporting programs for modernizing selected public sector institutions, improving
government administration, the judiciary, local self-government, and budgetary management at
federal and sub-national levels. The Bank w i l l expand i t s engagement in regions in these areas, in
accordance with the federal priority for improving public sector performance at the subnational
level.
Modernizing selected public sector institutions: The completion o f on-going projects,
together with a new project in the pipeline, w i l l contribute to the modernization o f public
institutions and improved public services. These include tax modernization, customs
development, cadastre and registration, fiscal federalism, performance-based budgeting,
treasury development, and a statistical development project (FY08).
Supporting the government program in administrative reform: The Bank w i l l continue
i t s close engagement with the government in the area o f administrative reform at the
federal and subnational levels, including the coordination and implementation o f
substantial donor funds. The primary goal w i l l continue to be bringing Bank and
international expertise to bear on the implementation o f the government’s program for
administrative reform, which currently places a strong emphasis on encouraging
initiatives at the subnational level. So far, the Bank has concentrated subnational work in
the Southern Federal Okrug and regions in the North-West. A possible project could be
also developed to promote administrative reform in lagging regions.
0

Stepping up engagement on judicial reform: Assistance on judicial reform also involves
the coordination o f donor funds and special cooperation at the regional level. A new
project i s currently under development for judicial reform (FY07) with a focus on
improving dispute resolution, the enforcement of laws, and the transparency o f
information
Support for budgetary reforms: The Bank w i l l continue to respond to the demands o f
the federal and some regional governments for assistance in budgetary reform and the
development o f performance-based budgeting. In addition, the Bank w i l l remain a
partner to the government in the continued scaling up o f the Fiscal Federalism Project
(now financed by the Russian government) and i t s expansion to the municipal level.

26

Supporting the reform of local self-government: The Bank w i l l continue i t s dialogue
with the government in this area, and in brining international experience to bear on this
vital area o f reform in Russia. A study has been launched for monitoring and assisting
the development o f local-self government in rural areas in the Perm, Penza, and Adygeya
regions. The Bank w i l l seek to engage directly with regions and municipalities in this
area on the basis of new modalities, including a discussion o f replicating the positive
experience o f the Fiscal Federalism Project model for building capacity at the municipal
level.
Investments in municipal development: On-going and possible future regional projects
have significance for overall municipal development and the quality of municipal
services. This includes the current Kazan and Saint Petersburg municipal development
projects, a housing and communal services project under preparation (FY07, also see
below), and possible regional projects on water and heating system upgrades.
Supporting anti-corruption initiatives: As a coherent national-level anti-corruption
program may begin to take shape, the Bank w i l l explore avenues o f possible constructive
contributions to such anti-corruption initiatives.
Improving the Delivery of Social and Communal Services

56.
In addition to continued general cooperation with the federal government, the Bank
w i l l concentrate much o f i t s support for improving social service delivery at the subnational level.
As noted above, the Government has prioritized the social sector and social services in i t s
medium-term program. Given that the primary responsibilities and initiatives for reform in the
area of social and communal services w i l l be at the subnational level, the Bank w i l l concentrate
i t s focus on the regions. M a i n activities include the continuation o f work in the areas o f poverty,
education, and health in cooperation with the regions. Additional activities include the
monitoring o f social trends and service delivery quality (joint with USAID) and special
employment-related activities in the Southern Federal Okrug (the development o f decentralized
employment services, and labor integration o f youth). Another critical area for improving living
standards i s provision o f housing and communal services. The government places high
importance on improving the performance o f the housing and communal services (HCS) sector
and on the delivery o f high quality services by communal enterprises, and closely links service
provision with improving the quality o f life. In this context, modernization and reforming o f
HCS was included in the recently approved Medium-Term Government Program for 2006-2008.
Continuation of the poverty work: In addition to continued cooperation with Rosstat and
federal ministries, the emphasis o f the Bank poverty work (in cooperation with DFID)
has moved to the regional level. The Bank i s working, and w i l l continue to work,
directly with regions on monitoring poverty and improving social assistance programs,
including labor market policies. Regional social protection strategies for Tver, Tomsk,
Kalmykia and three other regions w i l l be developed with Bank assistance. Successful
models o f cooperation can be scaled up to similar regions.
Zmproving the health of the population: The Bank w i l l continue i t s engagement with
the government on adult health, and the development of a national strategy to improve
the health o f the population, with the goal o f reversing the strongly negative trends in
premature mortality and morbidity. As a follow up to earlier child welfare efforts and
jointly with international donors the Bank w i l l assist in design and implementation o f
practical mechanism for family support, preventive social welfare and child care at
federal and regional level. Additional advocacy, public awareness and information
sharing efforts jointly with government leaders, public figures, private sector and NGOs

27

w i l l be undertaken in support o f critically needed government policies in this area.
Another priority i s to advise federal and regional authorities on appropriate risk pooling,
insurance, and sustainable health financing. I F C w i l l continue working with private
companies on programs for occupational health, including H I V - A I D S issues. The Bank
w i l l implement on-going projects in the health sector and offer to scale up or modify
existing models at the subnational level as a service to regions. The development o f
public-private partnerships in the health sector could be supported jointly b y TA from the
Bank and direct financing b y IFC to PPPs and/or purely private providers. Lessons from
the TB/AIDS project could be applied through more focused interventions in interested
regions through subnational projects and TA. A few regional projects could be supported
for removing environmental hotspots and addressing other environmental concerns
posing major health risks to population.
Modernization and improvement of the education system and vocational training: The
Bank w i l l complete current projects in education designed to modernize the system and
improve vocational training. As i s the case for the area o f health, the Bank w i l l seek to
meet demands o f regions for special support at the subnational level for education reform.
Regional TA and possible projects could focus on improving systems for professional
and vocational education, accompanied by parallel assessments o f local labor markets
with an eye to improving the quality o f local professional labor supply. The recently
completed Youth Strategy by the Bank provides recommendations for improvements in
youth policies, with possible applications to Russia for forwarding the dialogue on youth
policies in the area o f education and training.
Improvement in the provision of housing and communal services: The Bank's support
in the sector o f infrastructure w i l l largely focus on improving quality o f utility services
and housing. The Bank has a large portfolio focused on improving heating, water,
electricity, and other municipal services in selected regions. This includes the current
Kazan and Saint Petersburg municipal development, municipal heating, municipal water
and electricity reform projects. A housing and communal services project (FY07) in
support o f reforms and investments in HCS on grant basis allocated to regions on a
competitive basis, and an electricity generation guarantee (FY08) w i l l continue Bank
efforts on improving quality o f utilities and housing services. Also, a large share o f subnational lending i s expected to focus on improving these services.
Housing finance and energy efficiency through ZFC's PEP program: IFC's PEP
program i s currently focusing i t s work on two new product platforms in Russia: Housing
Finance and Energy Efficiency, both o f which are complemented b y I F C investments in
this area. The Primary Mortgage Development Project i s working to streamline the
mortgage lending process in Russia at two levels: first, the project works to consolidate
the efforts o f key industry stakeholders to improve the legislative environment for
mortgage lending and to develop a set o f standardized products for use across the
industry; second, the project works with 8 financial institutions to assist them in
improving internal operational practices. IFC's Sustainable Energy Efficiency Program in
Russia combines IFC's advisory and investment capacity. The project makes credit lines
available to banks for on-lending for energy efficiency projects, and provides technical
assistance to banks and private companies in order to raise the lending volumes available
for energy-saving projects. The program has already disbursed i t s first credit line to
Center Invest Bank in Rostov, and currently has a US$60 million pipeline o f potential
deals across all regions o f Russia. IFC also runs a number o f additional programs in
Russia, including support for corporate governance in the banking sector, for
improvement o f forestry management practices in the Northwest, and for development o f
local suppliers to the mining sector in the remote region o f Magadan.

Enhancing Russia’s Global Role

57.
The Bank has a strong commitment to support Russia’s increasing global role, and
assist the country in fulfilling its global commitments. The Bank w i l l continue cooperation with
the Russian government in support o f i t s emergence as an international donor and active member
o f multilateral organizations. In addition, the Bank w i l l assist in establishment o f mechanisms and
implementation o f specific actions arising from Russia’s global engagements, such as the Climate
Change
and
Biodiversity
Conventions,
and
pandemic
diseases
initiatives.
During the CPS period, the Bank w i l l also seek to share with Russian experts i t s analysis (and
advocacy) that i s currently directed towards the traditional D A C donors. Specific areas for
Bank’s engagement in Russia are:
Assistance in the formulation of an ODA strategy for Russia as emerging donor: The
Bank w i l l continue to assist Russia as an emerging donor, and w i l l cooperate on the design
of Russia’s development aid strategy and the establishment o f a national O D A system.
Specific Bank support includes trainingbapacity events, information sharing, and advisory
services. The Bank w i l l remain engaged with Russia on international policy initiatives
developed under Russia’s G-8 presidency, including on Russia’a priority themes for
international assistance - quality o f education, energy poverty, and the spread o f infectious
diseases.
Providing access to the Bank’s instruments for channeling Russian developmental
assistance: The Bank w i l l help in arranging an Africa debt-for-development swap, the
establishment o f an Avian Flu Trust Fund, the implementation o f the Education For
AllEast Track Initiatives and Russia’s participation in the Global Village Energy
Partnership. I t w i l l also facilitate expanding Russia’s role in IDA. Beginning with a highlevel Emerging Donor Meeting in April 2006, the Bank i s assisting Russia in organizing
development aid seminars and international events. The Bank w i l l also seek opportunities
for increased engagement o f Russian experts in development policy debates, their
participation in the Bank’s work in other countries, and “staff secondments” for building
capacity within the Russian Government for aid allocation and management.
Fulfilling international obligations related to global goods: The Bank w i l l assist Russia
in developing procedures and mechanisms for implementing specific activities in the
framework o f the Climate Change and Biodiversity Conventions. TA i s currently being
provided on the introduction o f low-carbon technologies and climate change mitigation. If
the government moves ahead with the introduction o f financial instruments for low-carbon
technologies in Russia, the Bank would be ready to support the preparation and
implementation o f a number o f carbon-finance projects. There are three GEF projects in the
Bank’s pipeline awaiting the establishment o f a legal and institutional framework for their
introduction at the regional level with federal oversight. Additional projects on biodiversity
and climate change could also be prepared. The Bank w i l l continue participation in the
Ministerial Conference on Forest Law Enforcement and Governance in Europe and North
Asia.
Linking Russian companies to global markets: IFC and MIGA activities are also relevant
to the expansion of Russia’s global role. In keeping with i t s global strategic objective to
encourage investment across emerging markets (South-South investment), IFC w i l l
continue to actively support strong, reputable Russian clients in investments elsewhere in
emerging markets.
Consistent with i t s strategic objective to support South-South
investments through the provision o f guarantees, MIGA w i l l continue to proactively engage
Russian companies planning to invest in emerging markets.

29

Focus on regions
58.
A greater focus of the Bank’s work on the regions requires a concerted approach and
coordination. The Bank has ongoing activities and projects in a large number o f Russian regions,
involving close cooperation with the federal government. The number o f regions in the Russian
Federation i s too large for effective coordination and funding o f Bank activities in regions across
the entire country. More effective collaboration at the sub-national level requires deep local
knowledge and a strong mutual commitment. To both interest Russian regions and have an
impact, the Bank w i l l need to offer an integrated package o f analytical and advisory work
combined with financing where feasible. A deeper regional engagement during the CPS period
therefore makes i t imperative that the Bank focus i t s attention on a more limited number o f
regions where i t can concentrate i t s work. Such a more focused approach would also allow the
scaling up o f successes achieved in particular regions to other regions.
59.
Based on the above principles, the Bank is working with the federal government, in
identifying a small sub-set of 6-10 regions that may become the target of concentrated work
programs with the Bank. Regions are being chosen from wealthier, middle income, and poorer
areas. Important criteria for the selection o f regions for Bank engagement are (i)
the willingness
and commitment o f the regional administration to work with the Bank; (ii)a past history o f
successful cooperation; (iii) the reform-orientation and competence o f the regional
administration; (iv) strategic importance o f the region for Russian development and the existence
o f other s i m i l a r regions for possible scaling up o f successful cooperation; and (v) the region’s
creditworthiness and potential interest in Bank operations (for wealthier or middle income
regions). Following initial engagement o f selected regions, the strategic directions and modalities
o f cooperation with the Bank w i l l be included in a joint Memoranda o f Understanding, to be
signed with the leaders o f the focus regions. As noted, Bank involvement at the regional level
would involve a combination o f targeted AAA on diagnostics o f the local economy and
investment climate, and development o f regional strategies, coupled with selected lending
operations to address key challenges.

60.
The World Bank Group intends to concentrate some work in poorer Russian regions,
which are often in most need of development assistance. The l i s t o f priority regions w i l l include
some such poorer regions. IBRD engagement in poorer regions that lack creditworthiness w i l l
depend significantly on opportunities for participation in federal programs or the coordination o f
donor funds. I F C w i l l make special efforts to support private sector activities in poorer areas.
For some poorer Russian regions which have achieved creditworthiness, potential opportunities
exist for fee-for-service activities or subnational lending without sovereign guarantees.
Discussions on the development o f new instruments w i l l give particular attention to facilitating
Bank work in poorer areas.

Expected Bank Group FinancingVolumes and Principles
61.
Annual I B R D lending projects and volumes will be determined in consultation with
the Federal Government as part of the consultations on its annual borrowing program. In
accordance with Government’s preferences, all IBRD lending i s foreseen in the form o f
investment projects. Currently, there are eight Bank projects in the Government-approved
borrowing program, o f which six lending operations (Housing and Communal Services, Judicial
Reforms, State Statistics Systems 11, IT Parks, Special Economic Zones, Microfinance
Infrastructure) and two guarantees. A set o f broad principles would be followed in the selection
and design o f future Bank projects: (i)finance priority activities in accordance with the CPS
strategic framework; (ii)finance activities as part o f the Government’s medium-term
fiscallexpenditure framework; (iii)
provide support for systemic solutions with lasting impact on
institutional capacity and potential for scaling up and replication; (iv) avoid design complexity;

30

and (v) mainstream implementation arrangements within existing institutions, while ensuring
sound fiduciary safeguards for project implementation. Annex B 3 provides details o f the initial
Bank lending program. While the IBRD lending volumes are expected to be very modest for a
country o f Russia’s size and economic performance, somewhat reduced lending may be
warranted in case o f unforeseen severe adverse developments on the macroeconomic or policy
front. In the event o f significant changes to the proposed strategy, a CPS progress report would
be prepared for discussion by the Board.
62.
Zn addition, Bank Group financing and guarantees will be provided by ZFC, MZGA,
G E F and the Carbon Finance Facility. IFC’s significant commitments in Russia over the CPS
period are expected to be in the order o f US$700 million per year. Expected lending from the
Sub-National Development Program i s expected to be in the order o f US$25-100 million per
year. MIGA’s portfolio i s expected to remain high. Potential GEF allocations are US$lO-20
million per year (the Bank i s preparing a US$20 million renewable energy project), with Carbon
Finance projects possibly reaching US$lOO-300 million depending on the regulatory framework
Russia i s currently preparing. As indicated earlier, successful and timely preparation o f projects
w i l l require streamlining the Government procedures for project approval.

Fiduciary Environmentfor Bank Lending
63.
The procurement environment for World Bank projects in Russia continues to be
complex despite recent efforts to improve the legal framework. In the past, a vast amount o f
often uncoordinated procurement legislation and norms complicated the realization o f many Bank
projects. A long-awaited major procurement law for the federal, regional, and municipal levels o f
government was finally passed and entered into force in January 2006. On the positive side, the
new law: (i)
regulates public procurement at all levels -federal, regional, and municipal- thereby
providing the basis for a single economic space, (ii)substitutes a single legislative act for
previous disperse, confusing, and sometimes contradictory regulations, (iii)provides for
advertisement and full disclosure o f all procurement processes by electronic means on official
websites, and (iv) creates the basis for electronic procurement in the future. The L a w also
provides mechanisms o f control and review o f complaints. Yet, in an effort to make the Law
‘‘corruption-proof” i t also prescribes a series o f rigid procedures that are at the expense o f
flexibility and competition and in contrast to international best practice.
64.
The Bank will need to remain vigilant in safeguarding sound procurement in Bankfinanced projects. Even more so, as Bank projects with the federal government w i l l be carried
out with increased co-financing. In this context, the Bank plans to maintain intensive supervision
o f procurement in Bank-financed projects. The Bank w i l l also maintain a strong dialogue with
Government in the interest o f improving the national procurement system and giving careful
consideration to the possibility of using acceptable features of current or modified national
legislation on procurement.
Due to remaining significant differences between the new
procurement law and the Bank’s procurement guidelines, insufficient practice under the new legal
framework, and the upward trend in corruption in Russia, the use o f the national procurement
system i s not yet an option for Bank operations in Russia.
65.
Thanks to concerted efforts, financial management risk for most projects has been
reduced. In 2001, the Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) assessed the
fiduciary environment o f the Russian portfolio as high risk and recommended maintaining ringfencing arrangements for fiduciary functions.
Since then, the Russian government has
accelerated the pace o f reforms in public financial management. Main achievements and ongoing
reforms include: (i)
in the area o f budget preparation, formulation o f a three-year federal budget;
strategic planning and gradual introduction o f performance-based budgeting; (ii)
progress in the
introduction o f a new GFS-based chart o f accounts, and (iii)
persistent delays associated with the

31

manual clearing procedures are expected to be overcome with the full implementation of the
Treasury Single Account mechanism and its related information system. In addition on the Bank
side, risk mitigating measures in financial management (FM) have been incorporated into project
design and implementation, including: (i)
development o f a risk management framework and
adoption o f a risk-based approach for FM work, which helps focus attention and resources on
particular areas o f vulnerability; (ii)
close work with client agencies at the project preparation
stage to identify measures to mitigate fiduciary risks, strengthen controls and develop borrower
capacity; and (iii)
at the project implementation stage, monitoring the continuing adequacy o f the
FM arrangements and satisfactory implementation o f action plans and controls’ performance. As
a result, the FM risk for most projects i s now considered to be moderate.

66.
Additional actions are planned over the CPS period to further reduce FM-related
fiduciary risks and improve portfolio quality, including: (i)
tightening some core FM practices
and increasing emphasis on quality and effectiveness o f FM work, especially on aspects that have
significant bearing on anti-corruption e.g., more rigorous follow-up on audit reports and
management letters, and more intensive review o f internal control systems; (ii)enhancing
supervision activities, including close monitoring o f identified high risk areas; (iii)
extending
consultations with FM quality assurance on project design and supervision o f projects with high
corruption potential; and (iv) linking FM supervision plans and resources with FM risk ratings.
The impact o f the reforms on the fiduciary environment w i l l need to be assessed before
contemplating greater use o f country systems in Bank-financed projects. In addition, as the Bank
moves towards sub-national lending without sovereign guarantee there w i l l be a need to gain
and/or update knowledge o f the fiduciary environments surrounding the flow o f funds, including
both the central and sub-national governments.
67.
To improve governance in the corporate sector, we expect the Government may
request a comprehensive Financial Sector Assessment (FSAP), which would be conducted
jointly with the IMF. The FSAP would be complemented and preceded by a Report on the
Observance o f Standards and Codes (ROSC) in Accounting and Auditing. The ROSC w i l l .
support reforms in the country’s accounting and auditing framework and practices. I t i s expected
to provide the recommendations to the Russian Government on: (i)
facilitating transition to the
international standards in accounting and auditing, which should support foreign direct and
portfolio investment in line with the country development goals; (ii)allowing investors to
evaluate corporate prospects and making informed investment and voting decisions; and (iii)
enhancing professional accounting education and thus the quality o f accountants in the country.

Partnerships
68.

’

Russia has benefited from a range of assistance from its various external partners.
International donors have been actively involved in assisting Russia in the transformation
process. International experience was actively shared and assistance provided on a broad set o f
macroeconomic management and business development issues, fiscal and public administration,
institutional and structural reform and social policies. International donors played a key role in
developing civil society and Russian domestic NGOs. But the scope o f international donor
assistance i s becoming more limited and selective as Russia economic performance i s improving.
I t i s concentrating now on issues o f good governance, budget and municipal reform, health sector
and infectious disease control, including HIV/AIDS, poverty reduction, child welfare and social
services development. A strong regional focus continues to be important for major donors like
EU, USAID, DFID, C I D A and SIDA, with emphasis on the regions o f the Northern Caucases,
North West and Kaliningrad.

69.
Given the absence of a program, the IMF’s role in Russia has been reduced to a
surveillance and advisory function. In this context, the IMF has continued an active dialogue

32

with the government on macroeconomic policy and the regulation o f the financial sector. The
Bank w i l l continue to coordinate i t s work in these areas closely with the IMF with the goal o f
reaching consensus and consistency in policy advice. The IMF has also continued valuable
analytical work on the macroeconomic situation in Russia, which examines changing risks and
vulnerabilities, and opportunities for a medium-term fiscal adjustment.

70.
The EBRD has continued its strong involvement in Russia, primarily in the private
sector. Since 2002, the EBRD has maintained annual investment levels in Russia o f over EUR 1
billion, 80 percent o f which has gone to the private sector. The EBRD has been particularly
active in the financial sector, energy, infrastructure, manufacturing, and, through the Russia Small
Business Fund, the SME sector. Like IFC, the EBRD has been introducing new financial
instruments in Russia, including ruble-denominated bond issues and loans in 2005, and working
increasingly with regional administrations. Enhanced work in Russia i s consistent with EBRD’s
general strategic goal to commit a larger portion o f i t s work to the East and South o f the E C A
region. Infrastructure and PPP-related projects w i l l be an increasing priority in the near future.
The EBRD remains a vital working partner for the World Bank Group, particularly for IFC. T o
date, IFC and EBRD have jointly supported more than 20 projects in Russia. Most o f these
projects are in financial markets, general manufacturing, and private equity funds. This
cooperation i s particularly valuable with larger projects, where neither organization can absorb
the full exposure needed, and with local partners, where both can play a role in developing the
company’s capacity.
71.
The Bank developed close working relationships and partnerships with various
donor organizations in support of Russia’s economic reform agenda. One prominent example
i s the program on public administration and budget reform supported by DFID, CIDA, SIDA, EU
and a Bank-hosted joint Donor Secretariat. The Bank has collaborated closely with the OECD on
issues o f tertiary education. The Bank and W H O jointly coordinated a partnership for work on
improving governance in the Southern Federal Okrug, which included the active participation of
USAID, EU, and DFID. A multi-sector Finnish trust fund i s currently supporting a diverse set o f
regional development activities in the regions o f the North West. DFID has also supported the
Bank’s poverty work in Russia. IFC’s Private Enterprise Partnership in Russia i s currently
funded by the Governments o f Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Switzerland and Saxony (of
Germany) as well as by GEF. Meanwhile, USAID, EU, EBRD, DfID and SECO have supported
FIAS operations in the country.

Results Monitoring
CPS results monitoring will be undertaken jointly with the Government. Monitoring
72.
w i l l track progress towards achieving outcomes influenced by Bank interventions agreed to be
undertaken as part o f the CPS. Annex 4 shows an indicative results matrix based on agreed
activities for initial Bank involvement. More specific results frameworks w i l l be built into the
individual Bank interventions. CPS results monitoring would be done jointly with the
Government as part o f the annual consultation process for assessing progress o f the CPS and
possible adjustments to the Bank program. These consultations would also provide inputs for
updating the CPS results framework to reflect such adjustments.

CREDITWORTHINESS AND RISKS
Creditworthiness and Bank Exposure
73.
Russia’s creditworthiness has improved significantly over recent years in tandem
with a reduction in its external debt. The high o i l prices o f recent years have built up reserves,
strengthened the fiscal position and by end-July 2006 allowed for the accumulation o f US$67.2
billion in the Stabilization Fund. Russia became a net external creditor in 2004. In 2005 Russia
paid off i t s outstanding US$3.5 billion to the IMF, as well as some US$20 billion in Soviet-era
debt, including US$15.6 billion in prepayments to the Paris Club. This brought the total public
external debt stock down to US$71.4 billion at the end o f 2005 (or 9.4 percent o f GDP),
compared with US$97.4 billion (16.5 percent o f GDP) at the end o f 2004. In 2006 Russia prepaid
all o f i t s remaining debt to the Paris Club (US 21.3 billion), which should bring Russian
sovereign foreign debt down to 4.5 percent o f GDP b y the end o f the year. The federal domestic
debt stock i s small, amounting to 4 percent o f GDP at the start o f 2006. The sovereign’s
commitment to pay i t s external creditors remains strong. B y the end o f April 2006, Russia
became the fourth-largest holder o f gold and foreign-currency reserves in the world. With o i l
prices expected to remain broadly at current levels over the forecast period, Russia would have n o
problems servicing i t s debt.
es

74.
At the sub-national level, the creditworthiness of Russia’s strongest regions also
continues to improve and offers expanding opportunities for lending without sovereign
guarantees by the Bank Group’s Sub-National Development Program High economic growth
in industrially developed Russian regions and the service-oriented largest cities has led to
increasing revenues. In addition, a series of tax, financial and legal reforms are reshaping Russian
sub-national operational environment, influencing the financial profile and creditworthiness o f
regional and local governments. Standard and Poor’s rates 11 local and regional governments in
Russia. The creditworthiness o f Russia’ strongest regions has improved over the past few years in
line with that o f the Russian federation, as evident by increased credit ratings (to “BB+” for
Moscow and St Petersburg from “BB-” in 2002 and “CCC-“ in 1998). But uncertainties
associated with the implementation o f the Russian inter-governmental reforms, the difficulties to
sustain growth in industrial-based regions under the current circumstances (high o i l prices and a
strong currency), and the uneven revenue growth across regions and local governments call for a
cautious and selective approach for Bank Group lending to regions without sovereign guarantees
(such lending by the Sub-National Development Program w i l l be on IFC’s books).

.

34

75.
I n line with the modest CPS lending scenario, IBRD’s exposure in Russia’s will
continue to decline. IBRD’s exposure in Russia i s expected to fall from US$4.9 billion at endFY06 to less than US$4.0 billion in FY09. I t s share o f the overall IBRD portfolio would decline
from 4.7 percent to 3.8 percent over the period.

Risks
76.
Macroeconomic risks associated with Russia’s oil dependency are considered low
during the CPS period. The repayment o f foreign debt and the rapid accumulation of reserves
have insulated Russia to a significant degree from external shocks. A very sharp decline o f o i l
prices could send ripples through Russian financial markets. Even in this event, government
finances would be protected during the CPS period by the large accumulated fiscal reserve
(Stabilization Fund). The Stabilization Fund (fiscal reserve) has accumulated resources to the
point that i t could sustain the government budget at current expenditure levels with o i l prices
under US$20 a barrel during the CPS period. Given that the Russia’s dependence on foreign
money concerns primarily sales o f o i l and gas, as opposed to inflows o f foreign investment, i t s
immediate macroeconomic vulnerability to changes in investor sentiment i s lower than in many
other emerging market economies. The immediate r i s k s from a sharp fall in oil prices, together
with a significant depreciation o f the ruble, would likely be confined to the non-government
financial sector in the short run, and could be contained through responsible macroeconomic
policy and bank regulation. Simulations reported in Annex 1 indicate that significant economic
growth and macroeconomic balances should be maintained over the CPS period even in the event
o f low o i l prices. A possible implication o f Russia’s high fiscal reserves for the Bank’s program
may be a further reduction o f IBRD’s lending program below the already modest levels foreseen.
Future Bank lending i s focused on leveraging Russia’s own funds through increased national cofinancing. Ultimately, the Government w i l l decide on borrowing from the Bank based on fiscal
conditions and the alternative options for availing the Bank’s value added, such as fee-for-service
arrangements.
77.
While macroeconomic risks are considered low, there are implementation risks
related to the pace and the direction of economic reforms. Russia’s political environment i s
currently stable. President Putin has a strong mandate and enjoys a constitutional majority in the
Duma. The executive branch has more leverage over regional and local governments than in the
past. The next presidential election in 2008 i s not expected to lead to significant changes in
policy. Nonetheless, there remains some uncertainty about the pace and the direction o f
economic reforms. While the current medium-term development program follows the general
transition goals o f the 2000 program, they also include more controversial areas o f economic
policy which have a mixed world experience. These include active state interventions along a
‘new industrial policy’ which aim at stimulating diversification and the innovation economy. The
Bank’s involvement in areas such as the new economic zones and industrial parks help to bring
best global practice to Russia for development o f such policy areas. Differing views could also
exist within the government on administrative and budgetary reform, particularly on the degree to
which these reforms should or should not concentrate attention on increasing control o f the
federal center over sub-national bodies. In these areas, the Bank can play a valuable advisory role
in transferring global experience and the state o f knowledge on potential advantages and risks
from the pursuit of one or another specific policy.
78.
Finally, there are implementation risks in the Bank moving to a more regional
approach and to the new modalities of operation. Some o f the proposed modalities such as subnational lending and the development o f a fee-for-service advisory program are either relatively
new for the Bank or limited in terms o f prior experience, and operational details are s t i l l evolving.
To address these risks, the Bank w i l l be selective in how i t approaches the evolving work in the
regions to ensure a critical mass and impact o f i t s interventions. In moving t o the new modalities

35

of operation, the Bank can build on the significant progress achieved with successful pilots
already completed in many o f the new areas. A complicating factor may be the recent public
procurement and competition laws which appear not to exempt I F I s from competition with
private market participants when seeking to provide paid services to all levels o f government or
direct sub-national lending. Consultations with the Government are underway to resolve this
apparent bottleneck, through expeditious amendments to the laws and/or the execution o f a stand
alone framework agreement with the Government.

Russian Federation: G r o w t h Scenarios for 2006-2009
1.
Assuming that the Russian government sticks to i t s basic economic policy
commitments, the Russian economy should continue to exhibit significant growth throughout the
CPS period, although capacity constraints may increasingly limit the pace o f expansion. For the
CPS period, oil prices present the primary source o f uncertainty for both for the pace and nature
o f future growth. Three scenarios considered below are projected for different o i l price
trajectories. In the medium and longer term, growth prospects w i l l depend greatly on economic
policy and reforms. This especially concerns the effective maintenance o f macroeconomic
stability, the development o f infrastructure and energy, and measures to improve the climate for
private investment, competition, and entrepreneurship. Growth prospects also depend on external
factors other than oil. Higher international interest rates, for example, could deprive Russian
enterprises of their current sources o f relatively cheap finance, with implications for profitability
and growth. As most foreign inflows come from o i l and gas, Russia’s macroeconomic position i s
not as vulnerable in the short term relative to most other countries in the region to changes in
investor sentiment about emerging markets.
2.
The table below presents base case, high o i l price and low o i l price projections for the
Russian economy through 2009. In the base case, the o i l price declines gradually from an
average price o f 65 dollars to 55 dollars a barrel by 2009. The high case scenario assumes an
increase o f the o i l price to 95 dollars a barrel in 2009. Finally, a low case scenario assumes a
significant declining trend in the price o f oil, down to 35 dollars a barrel b y 2009.

3.
All three scenarios are consistent with the continuation o f economic growth, macrostability, and both fiscal and current account surpluses. Yet, they pose different sorts o f policy
challenges. Under the low case scenario, fiscal and current account surpluses largely evaporate
by 2009. This scenario would most likely also be accompanied by a substantial weakening o f the
capital account. Quite probably, such a decline in o i l prices would shake up the Russian financial
sector and create serious problems in some commercial banks. The Central Bank should manage
to isolate these problems in a handful o f problem banks with high o i l price or foreign exposure,
and thereby prevent a general financial crisis. In this low o i l price scenario, the manufacturing
sector o f the economy would receive a much-needed boost in competitiveness, but might also
find itself more liquidity constrained in the short due to the problems in the financial sector. Due
to this factor and slower growth in domestic demand, economic growth would be lower. Inflation
would be higher than in the base case o i l scenario due in part to ruble depreciation and higher
prices for imports.
4.
The high o i l price scenario presents a challenge in the form o f even larger balance o f
payments inflows. In order to keep inflation under control (at s t i l l 10 percent) and protect
tradable sectors o f the economic from an extremely rapid real exchange rate appreciation, the
government would be compelled to generate ever greater federal budgetary surpluses, up to 14
percent o f GDP in 2009. In this scenario, economic growth accelerates slightly to 6.5 percent of
GDP, but this would be accompanied by an even more rapid decline in employment in
manufacturing, with the movement o f labor and other assets to non-tradable sectors. Restrictive
macroeconomic policy would be essential for maintaining macroeconomic stability and
preventing the overheating of the economy. An extremely rapid accumulation o f reserves (By
2009, US$ 690 billion in gross currency reserves and a Stabilization Fund o f over US$ 600
billion) would challenge the government to minimize the opportunity costs o f delays or
inefficiencies in the investment o f this money in a diversified international portfolio.

5.
In the base case scenario, the current account and balance of payments moves gradually
toward equilibrium, and pressure on the ruble subsides somewhat. Annual GDP growth continues
at five percent through 2009, and inflation falls to 5 percent. Thus, o f the three scenarios, relative
stability in o i l prices presents the best opportunity for reducing inflation.

Annex 2

Russian Federation: Development Challenges and Regional Issues
1.
Russia’s rapid growth, increased wealth and political stability since 1999 provide
opportunitiesfor tackling a unique and di,fficult set of development challenges. They encompass
remaining hurdles in economic transition to a market economy (judiciary, regulatory institutions,

etc.), issues common to developed market economies (such as aging population, eradication of
poverty), problems stemming from the dominance of extractive industries and the effects of “Dutch
Disease,” and Russia-specific tasks (more efficient development o f i t s vast territory, o f which a
large part functions under harsh climatic conditions).

Sustaining Rapid Growth
2.
While the Russian economy should continue to grow over a wide range of possible
scenarios, maintaining or accelerating the current pace of growth will be a challenge. Current
annual GDP growth i s projected to be 4.5 - 6.5 percent over the next 5 years. While this i s a very

respectable pace for a middle income country, this average growth falls short of the 7 percent target
necessary to double GDP in ten years in accordance with the government’s objectives. Achieving
and sustaining high growth requires that the Russian government maintains macroeconomic
stability, while at the same time realizing key structural and spatial policies.

Macroeconomic stability remains essential for growth. Strong commitment to budget
3.
discipline and huge surplus revenues associated with high oil prices have transformed the
macroeconomic environment, facilitating the elimination o f budget deficits, the accumulation of
reserves, and a major reduction in outstanding debt. But windfall oil revenues also imply new
challenges. They underpin the financial strength of the government, but also present two types o f
important macroeconomic risks: (i)
upward pressures on inflation and the real exchange rate and
(ii)
a risk of potential volatility due to the high dependence of the economy and government finance
on oil prices.
With regard to the first risk, the Russian government has shown notable monetary and
fiscal restraint at a time of heated domestic demand, primarily b y generating high fiscal
surpluses and accumulating windfall revenue in a Stabilization Fund. Even so, annual

inflation has remained rather high at over 10 percent.

With regard to the second risk, few experts expect a sharp fall in oil prices at the present
time. Nonetheless, oil prices have historically been quite volatile and difficult to predict,
and this i s a source of risk to Russia. A sharp fall in oil prices, and an associated

depreciation of the Russian ruble, would likely cause problems for a number o f Russian
banks, as well as for some Russian firms that have accumulated significant foreigndenominated debt.

4.
Rapidly growing reserves place a new and increasingly important demand for quickly
developing asset management capabilities in the government and the Central Bank. In the

context o f high oil prices, Russia has been accumulating fiscal and monetary reserves at an
extremely rapid rate. So far, the corresponding fiscal Stabilization Fund i s simply held as an
account by the government at the Central Bank. As the size of this fund increases, the opportunity
costs of not investing these reserves in a diversified portfolio are mounting. The fact that the fiscal
reserve i s not so invested also increases pressures to use it for domestic purposes, which carries a
high inflationary risk and could undermine macroeconomic stability. To counter these pressures
and ensure more effective use of the accumulated resources, the Government has decided to set up a
fund for future generations b y investing a portion o f the Stabilization Fund in a longer-term
diversified portfolio. The fund has the potential to grow into an important source of income for
Russia, playing a major role in meeting future social obligations and creating a large diversified
source of income that will protect the budget against volatilities in oil and gas revenues. T o achieve

Annex 2
Page 2 of 13

this potential, Russia will need to make an investment in the next couple of years into institutions of
oversight and governance for portfolio management in correspondence with best international
practice.

5.
Diversification occupies more and more of a prominent place in Russian policy
debates, as economic growth in Russia has become increasingly concentrated in non-tradable
sectors of the economy. The inherited Soviet economic structure offered Russia few initial
opportunities for international competitiveness outside of resource-related industries. The
exhaustion of temporary factors that supported broad-based growth in the immediate post-crisis
period, along with much higher oil and gas prices, once again favor the development o f resource
sectors and non-tradables relative to manufacturing. The strong appreciation o f the Russian ruble
can be associated with domestic labor costs that are, for example, roughly double those of
neighboring Ukraine, which has comparable labor productivity. The recent Investment Climate
Assessment suggests that, b y contrast, Russian productivity in manufacturing i s close to that of
Ukraine, as well as to China and India where labor costs are many times lower.

6.
Diversifcation and development of the knowledge-based economy can be critical to
Russia’s future prospects. While Russia’s current development model as a major energy supplier
with a thriving and profitable domestic market i s consistent with continued growth and welfare
improvements for the population, this model also poses significant risks and arguably constrains

Russia’s economic potential. A high dependence on oil and gas makes Russia highly vulnerable to
changes to commodity prices. Natural resource supplies in Russia are also not unlimited.
Increasing evidence from the recent experience in economic growth suggests major advantages for
countries that succeed in developing highly competitive manufacturing and innovation industries.
Russia has potential advantages from a generally high level of human capital. A strong ruble and,
consequently, high labor costs in Russia relative to many other middle income countries, suggest a
natural specialization in highly-skilled labor. Thus, the degree to which Russia can succeed in
igniting a competitive innovation-based economy w i l l determine much for i t s prospects for
sustaining high rates of growth over the longer term.

7.
While Russia has made some important strides in improving the investment climate,
further improvements will be needed for realizing the ambition of a dynamic, diversified, and
knowledge-based economy.
The Russian business climate s t i l l suffers from insufficient

competition, a weak judiciary, the common capture o f markets at the regional level, problematic
access to land and premises, and remaining uncertainty over property rights. While the World Bank
Group’s Doing Business Report and recent I C A Surveys confirm that Russia may have, for
example, reached or surpassed India and China b y many o f basic investment climate indicators
(registration, taxes, permits, customs, inspections), many problems remain. Concentration in
Russia i s high. Evidence collected in the Country Economic Memorandum o f 2003 suggests that
almost half o f all sales in the economy in 2002 may have been associated with 22 large business
groups. While more recent comparable data i s not available, partial evidence suggests that the
concentration in ownership has grown s t i l l further in the last few years. This i s particularly true for

Annex 2
Page 3 of 13
the share of government participation in the economy, which has been the cause of some concern.
The process of “creative destruction,” involving high levels of entry and exist in fluid markets,
which i s vital for “the innovation economy,” w i l l need to be fostered in Russia through reforms that
improve incentives at the subnational level for good governance (see below) and a further
strengthening of market institutions. In recent years, more Russian businesses have been citing
corruption and unfair competition as significant problems for their operations.

8.
The share in employment of small businesses and individual entrepreneurs remains
quite low in Russia (26 percent) by international standards. This appears directly related to
problems in concentration and unfair competition discussed above. Many o f the remaining
administrative barriers to business in Russia fall disproportionately on small business. Results from
the I C A survey suggest that firms in Russia facing the greatest degree of competition (including
SMEs) also face the highest reported investment climate constraints. A recent FIAS study on
Russia highlights in particular problems in access to land and premises for entrepreneurs.
9.
Increasing private investment rates is essential to maintaining rapid growth. Fixed
capital investment has been growing at double digit annual rates, although from a very low base.
But it remains low in absolute terms relative to Russia’s development needs. Fixed capital
investment amounts to roughly 18 percent of GDP in 2005, which can be compared to rates o f over
25 percent in most emerging market countries that have sustained rapid growth over a number o f
years. Potential investment growth, including FDI, suffered in the context o f the Yukos affair and
other mixed signals coming from the government concerning the appropriate role o f private capital
in the Russian economy. The year 2005 witnessed progress in the clarification o f these issues, but
regulatory and other problems continue to limit investment, particularly more risky investments in
the manufacturing sectors o f the economy.
Higher investment is needed throughout the economy: in extractive industries,
10.
manufacturing, transportation, electricity, and the social sectors. Investments in manufacturing
are critical for diversification, and yet they are particularly low. Only 17 percent o f fixed capital
investment currently goes to manufacturing industries in Russia, raising concerns over the ability of

these industries to increase productivity at a pace that would ensure their future competitiveness. A
primary source of productivity increases in industry in recent years has been labor-shedding. Yet
this source may now be reaching i t s limits. While the oil and gas sectors have attracted a large
share o f Russian investment in recent years, the estimated needed investment for exploration and
the exploitation of new deposits i s much larger. Infrastructure in transportation, electricity, and the
social sectors has suffered from neglect and low investment throughout the transition period. The
government now has both the will and the resources to increase investment in infrastructure.

11.
Infrastructure is very important for Russia’s economic development. There i s a growing
demand for infrastructure services such as new roads, urban transportation, electricity and heat
supply. At the same time, the extensive networks o f existing infrastructure - including power,
telecommunications, communal services and transportation developed during the Soviet time -have not been properly maintained during the transition, which i s leading to deterioration o f service
quality and growing liabilities for rehabilitation. According to federal government estimates, the
one-time rehabilitation needs of the communal services sector amount to around US$33 billion. In
this context, the government has been increasing infrastructure investment, and i s also malung
significant efforts to facilitate private-public partnerships in the provision o f infrastructure services.
Some recent examples include establishment of an Investment Fund to support PPP projects, the
adoption o f a concession law, the preparation of a conceptual framework and draft legislative
package for toll roads and the development of a mechanism for guaranteeing private investments in
electricity generation.

The problem of infrastructure development is related to a more general dilemma that
12.
makes economic transition and sustaining rapid growth in Russia much more complicated than
in many other former socialist countries, namely the spatial misallocation of people and capital.

As a legacy of Soviet planning, a substantial part o f the Russian population and capital stock

Annex 2
Page 4 of 13
remains in cold and isolated regions, where the costs o f maintaining infrastructure and production
are relatively high and the prospects for developing competitive industries are relatively low. In
this context, the government w i l l need to make difficult decisions on where to concentrate i t s
resources to support infrastructure and growth, and where to focus instead on encouraging outmigration to more promising areas. The development o f potential growth points i s also currently
constrained by infrastructure, particularly in housing for migrants and transportation. In larger
cities, as increased prosperity brings increased car ownership, development o f urban transport
infrastructure, urban traffic management and integration o f public and private transport systems are
key challenges.
13.
While Russia has made substantial progress in many areas of economic reforms,
housing and communal services, gas, and, to certain extent, electricity reforms are still far from
realizing their true potential. This poses significant impediments for creating market mechanisms
for the delivery of housing and utility services. Currently, the most ambitious reform program i s in
the electricity sector, with two distinct and equally critical parts: the structural and market reform
on the one hand, and regulatory reform on the other. Structural reform - particularly, unbundling the
regional utilities, i s proceeding fast, representing the most advanced component o f reform and have
the potential to result in a more efficient and competitive market structure. Russia i s one of the
most energy intensive economies on the planet. In 2004, Russia’s economy had consumed about 0.9
k g o f oil equivalent per one US dollar of GDP, measured b y purchasing power parity (PPP), while
the same rate in developed and even developing countries stands at 0.1-0.2 k g o f o i l equivalent per
dollar.
14.
Both the growth potential and possibilities for increasing efficiency in the Russian
natural gas sector are very large. The sector i s dominated by Gazprom, the state-controlled
company (5 1% state-owned after the recent acquisition of shares b y the Government) which
controls the Unified Gas Supply System (UGSS) and holds a monopoly for gas exports from
Russia. Despite the remarkable growth in gas prices on international markets, Gazprom’s
production levels have been increasing at a much slower rate than the Russian economy as a whole
(1.5% per annum over the last five years, as against an all-industry average o f over 6.7%.). Lack o f
investment in the development o f new gas fields and related infrastructure i s a particularly pressing
concern, given the growing demand for gas both at home and abroad.

As the Russian population shrinks and ages, labor supply is becoming an ever greater
15.
constraint on economic growth. The most recent Investment Climate Assessment o f the World
Bank and Higher School of Economics confirms that inadequate labor supply, most particularly
skilled labor, i s already a major problem for many firms. Furthermore, the training of labor in
Russian firms appears to be inadequate, while both formal and informal education systems are not
oriented toward s k i l l s to support higher productivity. Medium term demographic trends are
particularly unfavorable. Over the medium term, the loss in worlung population w i l l become even
more acute. A recent World Bank report, “Dying to Young,” emphasizes the relationship between
labor supply issues and the acute problems in the poor health of the population and premature
morbidity. Thus, improving the health of the population i s a primary challenge in this area.
Migration, both external and between regions, i s a particularly critical economic and political
question for Russia in the context o f a rapidly ageing and declining population. In addition, the
current and insufficient quality of migration legislation and i t s weak enforcement pose substantial
political and other risks to the country labor supply in the future. The government has been giving
increasing attention to migration recently, i s developing programs to provide incentives for the
resettlement to Russia o f Russians living abroad, has drafted a new law on the registration o f
migrants, and made changes to the federal law on the rights of foreign citizens living in Russia.
The Russian banking sector is still small relative to the needs of the economy but
16.
growing rapidly and in need of additional capital. The Russian banlung sector has recovered and
grown at a very rapid pace since i t teetered on the verge of collapse in 1998-1999. After this crisis,
the Central Bank refrained from any significant recapitalization or refinance program. Instead,
most banks were left essentially cut off from refinancing or government contracts, needing to fend

..

Annex 2
Page 5 of 13
for themselves or shut down. In the absence of deposit insurance, commercial banks (other than the
State Savings Bank) wishing to work with household deposits had to compete for the trust of the
population themselves. Under these conditions, a number o f Russian banks rose to the
opportunities provided b y growing demand for finance from profitable firms. Credit to the nonfinancial sector has grown from negligible levels in 1999 to over 25 percent o f GDP. Consolidation
has begun, yet important problems remain. Vulnerability to an o i l price shock i s a major concern.
Many Russian banks are poorly capitalized, and the correct monitoring o f bank capital in the
Russian context o f large business groups with l o w transparency i s quite difficult. Also challenging
in bank regulation i s the introduction and enforcement o f IFRS reporting to the Central Bank.
Important weaknesses also remain in institutions and procedures of resolution for problem banks.
Two years ago, a reform that introduced state deposit insurance for household deposits has made it
imperative for the Central Bank to improve i t s monitoring capabilities. A very large share of
commercial banlung in Russia remains concentrated in a few large state banks, and competition in
the industry i s limited although growing with the entry o f foreign banks and the growth of some
Russian banks.

17.
Development of the rural and small-town economy presents a particular challenge. 27
percent o f the population lives in rural areas and 10 percent are employed in agriculture. This
compares with EU 15 countries where 22 percent of the population are rural but only 4 percent are
employed in agriculture. Especially in the more densely populated areas, there are substantial
opportunities for strengthening and diversifying the economy through the creation o f more flexible
land markets, improved access to financial services, enhanced landscape management, and
improved provision o f basic infrastructure and social services. In this context, small businesses
could assume a more prominent role in production and the processing o f higher quality, higher
value added food and agricultural products.
18.
The rural economy still largely depends on agriculture, which still faces major
structural challenges. Since strong growth o f agricultural output following the devaluation o f

1998, the sector growth has since contracted, and has been growing at 2% to 3% over recent years.
The food processing sector, largely privatized, appears to be undergoing a gradual transformation in
response to the increasing competition caused by a relatively open trade policy, changing patterns
of consumer demand, and changes in the prices and sources o f raw materials. Yet, remaining
challenges include slow liquidation of unprofitable farms and the transfer o f their assets to more
efficient enterprises, inefficient input subsidies for fertilizer, credit (interest rates), and machinery,
and some regressive trade and price policies. These slow down the shedding o f loss making
enterprises from the sector and impede growth in output and productivity. Although the proportion
of loss-making enterprises i s falling slowly, 37% o f agricultural enterprises are s t i l l loss-making 15
years after reform began. Overall budget subsidies to agriculture and rural development are much
lower in Russia than in OECD countries. However there i s substantial potential to reorient these
programs to focus more on delivery of public goods rather than on market interventions. Removal
of remaining trade barriers and production quotas, reform o f the present machinery leasing
arrangements, support to further development of land markets, and support to effective weather
based crop insurance systems are also priorities.
19.
Environmental degradation may present a growing threat to Russian development in
many areas. Pollution declined over much of Russia during the 1990s, mostly because o f the
decline in industrial and broader economic activity. Economic recovery i s bringing a new and
different set of challenges. While forest management i s beginning to incorporate broader

ecosystem approaches and expenditures on protected area management are increasing, fires and
illegal logging are s t i l l a threat to longer term sustainability, and tourism development needs to
incorporate landscape management. Water resource and water quality management remain
inadequate, and agricultural land management does not always take sustainability approaches into
account. Energy efficiency i s s t i l l low in Russia. In recent years, environmental matters have not
occupied a priority place in Russia’s reform and policy agenda. (See Box below).

Box :The Environment: A Growing Concern
Environmental matters have not occupied a priority place in Russia's recent reform and policy agenda.
Changes in the administrative arrangements for environmental management at central level, and
decentralization, have led to increasing regional differentiation in the quality o f environmental oversight.
Government i s now voicing concerns over the lack o f clarity in regards to natural resource protection and
management and broader environmental oversight.
Environmental degradation presents a threat to Russian development in many areas. Pollution as
conventionally measured declined over much o f Russia during the 1990s, mostly because of the decline in
industrial and broader economic activity. Economic recovery i s bringing a new and different set o f
challenges. Industrial pollution legacies remain, and impede effective urban and peri-urban development in
some areas, although much new industrial development uses modem, less polluting technologies. Rapid
urban redevelopment, with disorderly land-use planning and poorly functioning land markets, impedes the
development o f livable cities. While forest management i s beginning to incorporate broader ecosystem
approaches and expenditures on protected area management are increasing, fires and illegal logging are still
threat to longer term sustainability, and tourism development needs to incorporate landscape management.
Water resource and water quality management remain inadequate, and agricultural land management does not
A clear, transparent system o f environmental
always take sustainability approaches into account.
management i s a key element in Russia's transition to a modem, competitive economy.
Going forward, Russia's growing international prominence on the one hand, and growing living standards o f
people on the other, w i l l most likely place higher demands on the quality o f environment in the country and
responsiveness over global goods. In recognition o f this Russia has recently undertaken a number o f
important initiatives; most prominently i t ratified the Kyoto Protocol in 2005. I t also hosted an international
conference on forest law enforcement and governance.

The Banks program in environment has focused on support to federal institutions, through a Forestry Project
focusing on improving the sustainability o f forest management, an Environmental Management Project
focusing on pollution abatement, and the recent National Hydromet Modernization project, aimed at
improving weather forecasting services. There have also been a number o f T A initiatives, on forestry, water
quality management in a river basin context, and environmental legacy issues and modernization o f the
chemicals sector. In the absence o f substantial borrowing for environment by the federal government, the
Banks program in the next years i s likely to focus on support to improving energy efficiency through carbon
finance, and on global public goods activities supported by the GEF across a range o f programs. In addition,
as the Banks regional program expands, i t i s likely that the Bank w i l l work on addressing specific
environmental priorities facing regions, where there i s a very substantial and challenging agenda. Possible
investment activities on a federal level could focus on projects dealing with environmental liabilities and
industrial modernization. The Bank w i l l stand b y ready to provide i t s technical assistance and advice to
important national environmental initiatives, if needed.

Public Governance

20.
Weak public sector governance remains a key impediment to accelerating Russia's
growth and improving the provision of social services. To a large degree Russian civil servants
s t i l l operate under distorted incentives in an inefficient system o f government administration that
was largely inherited from the Soviet Union. So far there have been modest results from efforts to
implement a far-reaching public administration reform, aiming to reduce the interference o f the
government in the functioning of the economy, improve the quality of administrative services, and
increase the accountability of civil servants to the public. There exits an abundance o f evidence
that problems in public administration and the judiciary continue to be major obstacles to
improvements in the business climate. Intergovernmental fiscal relations have also been a primary
source of distorted incentives for governmental officials and budgetary inefficiency.
Correspondingly, they have been the subject o f major reforms that are s t i l l in the process o f
implementation.

Annex 2
Page 7 of 13

21.
Russia has been working to build a modern civil service and government
administration, although these reforms are far from complete. During the transition period, the

Russian civil service has suffered from the Soviet legacy o f l o w pay, weak economic (performancebased) incentives, and an administrative apparatus riddled with inefficiencies and redundancies.
This has been a source of corruption and a thorn in the side o f the business climate. Recent years
have witnessed some improvements. In particular, the pay for federal and many sub-national civil
servants has been increased closer to market rates, the organization o f the federal government
apparatus has been streamlined, and evaluation and recruitment processes have been transformed.
A strong emphasis has been placed on a better articulation o f goals and the measurement o f results
in the evaluation of civil servants. Part of the current stage of the administrative reform
concentrates on the regional level. Recently, the Ministry of Economic Trade and Development
conducted a competition among Russian regions and federal executive bodies for federal financial
support of regional programs. 29 out o f 46 participating regions, and 19 out o f 22 participating
federal executive bodies, were awarded financial support on the basis o f the strength o f their
proposed programs. Yet, the transformation of government administration in Russia i s likely to be
a slow and complicated process. This was illustrated well in 2004, when an attempt at a rapid leap
forward in the re-organization of the federal government proved very disruptive to government
operations in the short term.

22.
Intergovernmental fiscal relations have undergone major changes since the 1990s, and
significant reforms are still at the implementation stage. The fiscal federalist system o f the 1990s
featured a high degree o f both formal centralization and informal decentralization. Saddled with
excessive federal expenditure mandates and lacking their own explicit revenue sources, subnational
governments created “shadow budgets” on the basis o f informal bilateral relations with firms
operating on i t s territory, and well as through debt offsets and various money surrogates. A system
of soft interbudgetary transfers gave weak incentives for responsible fiscal management or
performance in the formal system. Reforms since 2000 have introduced a more rational formulabased transfer formula, greatly reduced unfunded expenditure mandates, created a clearer and more
stable division of revenue and expenditure assignments among different levels of government, and
delegated more expenditure autonomy to lower levels o f government. A centralization of political
power has granted the federal government greater leverage over many o f the activities of
subnational administrations. A very ambitious reform in local self-government has created 1000s
o f new municipalities in Russia, and aims to establish genuine budgetary institutions at the local
(municipal) level o f government. Many regions are also following the federal lead in developing a
medium-term budgetary framework and performance-based budgeting. A number o f regions are
pursuing and obtaining international debt ratings. Nevertheless, survey evidence suggests that
problems remain in funding imbalances, continued budgetary pressures in the form o f informal
mandates (as recommendations), and perceptions at the subnational level that improved budgetary
performance w i l l be inadequately rewarded by the federal center. The implementation of the local
self-government reform has been particularly complicated, due in part to problems of inadequate
local capacity and unforeseen imbalances in revenues and expenditure responsibilities.

23.
Judiciary reform remains central to building rule of law in Russia. Recent Bank work
on Judicial Systems in Transition Economies highlights the fact that building a strong demand and
capacity for an independent and effective judiciary system has been among the most difficult
institutional reforms in most transition countries. Russia i s no exception. Although the judiciary
has become increasingly important for resolving economic conflicts in Russia since the 1990s, i t
s t i l l needs to improve i t s credibility among the population. Serious problems remain in the
competency, training, and compensation schemes for judges, and in the ability of courts to enforce
decisions. Information disclosure on court cases i s insufficient. The government has made
information disclosure (including computerization of the judiciary network) and better conditions
for judge’s particular priorities in the current stage o f judicial reform.
24.
The Russian government has demonstrated a concern over the new evidence of
corruption. After a period o f decline during 1999-2002, recent evidence from business surveys
(BEEPS in particular) indicates that corruption has taken an upward turn and appears to be a

Annex 2
Page 8 of 13
growing obstacle to business. While survey evidence suggests that levels o f corruption in Russia
are not extremely high relative to other middle income countries, there i s evidence from a number
of sources that progress in battling corruption in Russia may have stalled or even reversed in the
last few years. The period from 1999 to 2002 witnessed important successes in economic reform in
Russia, including comprehensive tax reform and campaigns to combat “administrative barriers to
business.” The reduction o f corruption as a barrier to business appeared particularly strong in
Russia. In 1999, roughly half of all Russian entrepreneurs in the BEEPS survey cited corruption as
a serious impediment to their business. B y 2002, this average for Russia fell to 29 percent. B y
2005, however, the frequency of citations o f corruption as a significant impediment to business in
Russia increased again to 39 percent. The causes o f the apparent recent deterioration in indicators
of corruption in Russia in BEEPS data, which i s mirrored in a number o f other recent surveys, are
not obvious. In fact, some o f the important measures taken b y the government to combat
administrative barriers to business date from the 2002-2005 period. Other measures during this
time in the budgetary sphere have increased the fiscal transparency at the federal and subnational
levels, as documented in the 2004 ROSC of the IMF.
25.
To address these indications of increased corruption, the government is putting in
place a number of initiatives. An anti-corruption program o f sorts i s beginning to take shape. One
initiative i s a comprehensive examination of existing legislation in many areas from the point of
view of closing loopholes for corrupt practices. The President has recently initiated major
administrative shakeups in the Customs Service and some regional administrations.
The
administrative reform, which had been stalled since problems in implementation emerged in 2004,
has received some new momentum in 2006. The reform in local self-government also has potential
importance for strengthening accountability to the public and civil society at the local level.

Challenges in the Social Sector and Social Services
26.
Russia’s main challenges in the social sphere will be sustaining the momentum in
poverty reduction under less favorable conditions, and improving the delivery of social services,
particularly in health, education, housing, and social assistance. These two goals are closely
related. An important dimension o f Russian poverty i s an increasingly problematic access to
quality social services for poorer segments of the population due to sharp increases in formal and
informal costs. Russia’s new strategic orientation toward the active support of growth points brings
new challenges for ensuring minimal welfare and opportunities for citizens in less fortunate
regions, while the feasibility o f migration to wealthier areas depends on improvements in housing
and other social services in high growth areas. The territorial concentration of poverty i s expected
to increase. Poverty i s already significantly concentrated in the republics o f the Southern Federal
Okrug, where political and social instability i s a critical problem. (In the republics of the Northern
Caucusus, per capita GRP in 2004 was below US$ 1560, and unemployment rates are commonly in
the range of 20 percent.) Unfavorable demographic trends place an additional burden on health and
pensions. Russia s t i l l has far to go in developing a social safety net, providing effective social
services, and assisting the resettlement and retraining o f a large part of the labor force. Thus, the
social sector has become a very high priority for the government in i t s current National Projects and
planned reforms in the government Medium-Term Program.
27.
Poverty and social services are particular challenges for regional and local levels of
government. The division o f budgetary responsibility delegates responsibility for most o f the
social sphere to the regional and local levels o f government. T h i s can be associated with a basic
financial tension, as richer regions typically have more resources for social support than do poorer
regions. The government corrects this, to some degree, through a transfer system that gives special
priority to the poorest regions. While federal programs are important for leading reforms in the
social sphere, regional and local initiatives are, and will continue to be, critical for addressing
poverty and improving social services. This i s particularly true as the new reform in fiscal
federalism gives regions and municipalities considerably more flexibility on the expenditure sides
o f their budgets. In this context, a number o f regions are already forging ahead in social reform,

Annex 2
Page 9 of 13
including Nizhnyi Novgorod, Samara, Tomsk, and Chuvashia. Federal reforms in the social sphere
w i l l most likely be increasingly focused on regional pilots, initiatives, and co-financing.
28.
Russia’s unfavorable demographic trends present threats to future welfare and the
provision of social services in addition to the labor supply issues emphasized above. For i t s level
o f income and development, the Russian Federation s t i l l exhibits disturbingly low indicators o f life
expectancy and morbidity. Furthermore, these indicators have yet shown little improvement over
the period of economic growth since 1999. New epidemics o f HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis present
major additional threats. An aging and declining population promise to place an ever greater
burden on the already strained pension and health care systems.
Concern about the health system h a s led government to placing it among its major
29.
priorities. Major structural weaknesses in the health care system include an overemphasis on
hospitals relative to primary care and disease prevention, poor monitoring o f health risks and the
quality o f services, an inefficient distribution o f health workers across geographic areas, low pay
for a large number of medical professionals, a shortage o f modem equipment, little budgetary
flexibility at the municipal level, and an under-funded national insurance system. Indeed, increases
in mortality and morbidity rates are particularly concentrated among the poor. Russia exceeds most
other countries, including those o f the EU, in per capita numbers of doctors, nurses, other hospital
personnel, hospital beds, and average lengths o f hospital stays. Yet i t lags behind in most other
areas, most particularly in health promotion and disease prevention.
Access to quality education may be declining for a large segment of the population for
30.
similar reasons to that of health care. The public education system in Russian i s burdened not
only with insufficient funding in many areas, but with a largely out-of-date administration and
structure inherited from the Soviet period. The government has so far created insufficient
incentives and opportunities for improving and modernizing education programs. There i s s t i l l a
specialized public education and the needs of the market. Government i s also turning i t s attention
to the need for improving the quality o f school education and student’s learning outcomes, and to
evidence of a decline in quality education for poorer segments o f the population. New government
initiatives address such important issues as the social status of teachers and the introduction o f I C T
in education. Finance for education i s growing. But the effect of the additional money w i l l be
limited if Russia does not succeed in modernizing i t s largely out-of-date administration and
curriculum

31.
The social assistance system remains regressive. The recent WB Russian Poverty
Assessment and other studies based on new (Nobus) data reveal Russia’s system of social
assistance to be one of the most regressive among transition countries. The vast majority o f
benefits accrue to particular social groups o f the population that have a rather low correlation to
true relative needs in social support. First attempts to address this problem though the monetization
of in kind benefits in early 2005 met with strong social resistance from the groups that had been
receiving such benefits, most particularly pensioners. Thus, the creation o f a more efficient
targeted system o f social assistance i s limited not only by technical, but by socio-political
complications. Better measurement of poverty and the identification of the poor at the regional
level are key tasks in this regard.
32.
Housing and communal services in Russia represent a complex web of subsidies, local
government control, and entry barriers to private business. The quality o f services i s often
exceedingly low, and shortages of affordable housing appear to be a primary constraint to vitally
needed migration to areas o f high growth and potential. The massive privatization o f individual
apartments to occupants in the 1990s distributed enormous benefits to those living in modem urban
areas and centers of economic growth. Yet those living in less attractive or promising areas are
commonly trapped by the unavailability o f housing elsewhere that i s affordable to them.
33.
While Russia stands well relative to many other countries with respect to gender
equality, the most prominent political and professional positions in the country are still male

Annex 2
Page 10 o f 13
dominated. Russia’s accomplishments are particularly visible in education. As many Russian
women today obtain a higher education as men. In the labor market, despite clear constitutional
guarantees and other legal safeguards, women eam less, are concentrated in low paid sectors and
under-represented in managerial positions. A recent comprehensive study o f b y the American Bar
Association, supported by USAID, concludes that Russian women also s t i l l face a relatively high
degree o f domestic violence and harassment on the job. A new government initiative greatly
expands guaranteed maternity benefits for women, although this could actually have problematic
side effects for discrimination against women in employment.

Russia’s Global Role and Integration into the World Economy
34.
Russia’s prospects depend very much on its integrahon into the world economy. The
recent world development experience strongly supports the notion that deep integration into world
markets i s a key to achieving and sustaining rapid economic growth. The speed and degree o f
integration should have a direct effect on the pace of institutional development in Russia,
particularly with regards to competition, the development o f the knowledge economy, and the
transparency and openness o f business practices. Integration with world markets i s also a key
condition for attracting foreign investment. The degree o f integration o f Russia in the world
economy has grown considerably in recent years, and should continue to grow following the
country’s accession into the WTO, although the structure of Russia’s integration in world trade i s
s t i l l strongly skewed toward energy and metals exports.
35.
Foreign competition has been a primary motivating factor for restructuring,
productivity increases, and innovation in the Russian economy. Given the high domestic
concentration o f production, and limited domestic competition in many markets, a primary source
of competitive pressure in Russia has come from foreign markets. In the 1990s, this pressure
created a dilemma for many financial constrained and un-restructured Russian firms. Yet, the
Investment Climate Survey confirms that Russia firms facing more competitive pressures, including
foreign competition, are likely to be more productive and more innovative than other Russian firms.
The knowledge-based (innovation) economy i s very much a global marketplace, where very high
integration i s world markets i s a necessary condition for success.
36.
WTO accession is an important step towards integration. In recent years, preparation
for WTO accession has been a primary motivating factor for Russia to align i t s legislation and
standards with world requirements in many areas. The effect has already been quite positive on
Russia’s markets and integration with the world economy. A recent World Bank study estimates
that benefits from pursuing and achieving W T O accession could amount to as much as US$ 19
billion dollars in medium term benefits. In addition to direct benefits, W T O accession i s an
important stepping stone toward free trade and other agreements that promise to deepen Russia’s
integration in world markets.
37.
Zmproving corporate governance significantly depends on economic integration.
Russia boasts generally progressive standards and laws in the area o f corporate governance that
mirror best international practice, and the improvement of standards and laws i s continuing.
Nevertheless, Russia continues to suffer from problems in the openness o f information, the
protection o f minority shareholder rights, and the overall transparency of business. Prospects for
the greater integration o f Russia in the world economy, and the related need for a favorable
international business reputation, provide quite strong incentives for Russian corporations to
improve their corporate governance practices, even above and beyond what i s prescribed b y law
and recommended national standards.
38.
Russia’s role as G8 member and donor is growing, and is in the process of developing
capacity for effective development aid. Improved economic performance and growing international
concerns over energy security have elevated Russia’s role as a G-8 member and emerging donor.
The 2006 G8 Presidency has granted Russia a unique opportunity for active involvement in the
policy dialogue on important global and regional issues, for providing major inputs, and for taking

Annex 2
Page 11 of 13
the lead on specific themes and agendas. Russia has participated in full in the HIPC initiative and
announced additional debt reduction through Africa debt for development swap (in collaboration
with the World Bank). I t has made contributions to the Avian Flue Global Program, E F M I and
GVEP programs, and has made a commitment to scale up i t s development support. However,
Russia i s s t i l l in the stage of determining i t s own strategic position in the donor community, and
w i l l continue to build relevant capacity.

39.
Russia’s size gives it a unique role in the global economy, including the management
of environmental, energy and forest resources. Although Russia presently uses energy much less

efficiently than most industrialized countries, it has ratified the Kyoto Protocol, thereby
demonstrating i t s commitment to combat global climate change. There i s great scope for Russia to
reduce carbon emissions through efficiency gains and reduced energy losses, resulting also in gains
to the local economy. Russia accounts for 22% of the world’s forest area. Russian forest policy
states a commitment to balance conservation and development goals. Russia could profit
significantly from an effort to increase transparency and reduce illegal activities in the forestry
sector, and the government has articulated such goals. There are also opportunities for improved
coordination with Western Europe and the timber importing countries o f East Asia.

Regional issues
40.
The 88 regions of the Russian Federation exhibit considerable geographic, ethnic and
economic diversity. Poverty headcount rates vary from 3 percent o f the population (Saint

Petersburg) to 56 percent (Dagestan). Among the 88 Russian regions (Subjects of the Federation)
as of 2004, 60 had gross regional product (GRP) levels that would qualify them for status as lowmiddle income countries, while 14 would have IDA-like status. Half o f these IDA-like regions
correspond to the ethnic republics of the Northern Caucuses. Poorer regions also include the nonRussian ethnic republics o f Tyva (Eastern Siberia), Altai (Western Siberia), Marii El (Volga area),
and Chuvashia (Volga area), as well as other agricultural or industrial regions in various parts of the
country (such as Ivanovo, Penza, Kurgan, Pskov). While many o f the poor ethnic republics of the
Northern Caucuses have strong growth potential (agriculture, surplus labor, tourism) that i s
currently constrained by political and ethnic conflicts, other cold and geographically remote
settlements in the North and East o f Russia arguably face an even more problematic economic
future.

41.
Since the mid-I990s, the cities of Moscow and Saint Petersburg have emerged and
strong points of growth and agglomeration, which has spilled over to some surrounding regions,
most particularly to the Moscow and Leningrad oblasts. Other regions that have achieved GRP
and income levels similar to Moscow and Saint Petersburg are primarily those rich in resources or
major metals producers. The two richest regions in Russia are the oil and gas rich autonomous
Okrugs of Khanty-Mansisk and Yamal-Nenetsk. Other leaders in GRP per capita include resource-

rich Chukotka, Sakha (Yakuntiia), Sakhalin, Tomsk, and Komi, as well as steel-producing Vologda
and Lipetsk. In recent years, while a number of regions have exhibited notable dynamism, no city
has yet distinguished itself as an alternative growth agglomeration point to Moscow or Saint
Petersburg. The emergence o f other such cities will be an important milestone in Russian economic
development.

42.
The collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s led to enormous regional differentiation
within Russia, but the initial period of economic recovery from the 1998 crisis favored rapid
growth and poverty reduction in many poorer Russian regions. The huge decline in Russian
industry o f the 1990s brought substantial poverty and hardship to industrial regions, while those
regions rich in natural resources fared much better. Following the 1998 crisis, however, a
depreciated ruble, huge excess capacity, and cheap labor supported broad-based economic growth,
particularly in the industrial regions that had experienced very rapid decline in the 1990s. Lossmaking industrial firms with excess capacity suddenly became profitable. During this time, on
average, poorer regions had even more success in poverty reduction than their richer counterparts.
Many the poorest regions experienced average annual growth rates above 6 percent during the
period 1998-2002.

43.
However, a strong trend toward regional inequality will likely resurface. The factors
that supported this rapid and regionally broad-based growth (a weak ruble, cheap energy and labor,
excess productive capacity) have now disappeared. Strong differences among Russian regions,
reflecting the Soviet legacy o f settlements that bear little relation to economic comparative
advantage, suggest that regional inequality w i l l likely become an increasingly acute problem.

Annex 2
Page 13 of 13
Recent industrial production data confirm a rather unequal picture in this regard, and are consistent
with possible growing regional disparities. While almost all regions experienced strong industrial
growth during the period of economic recovery, 11 of 88 regions experienced industrial growth of
less than 1 percent in 2004, and 9 of these regions showed negative industrial growth. In 2005, 23
regions reported industrial growth of less that 1 percent, and 15 Subjects o f the Federation
experienced industrial declines relative to the same period of the previous year.

Figure :Annual industrial production growth by region: 2005 (% relative to 2004)

44.
An emerging national strategy for regional development places emphasis on creating
and supporting points of agglomeration and growth. The Russian government recognizes that
achieving diversified growth will require the formation o f growth agglomerations in urban areas

other than Moscow and Saint Petersburg. Relative to other industrialized countries, Russia has too
few large cities. Given the inherited Soviet legacy, the new strategy, as reflected in the MediumTerm Government Program, acknowledges that regionally equitable growth throughout the Russian
Federation i s unlikely, and the facilitation of more rapid internal migration w i l l be critical to the
growth and welfare prospects of the country in years to come.

World Bank Group: Comparative Advantages

This Annex presents the particular comparative
advantages of the World Bank Group for Russia
in knowledge, expertise, governance, and filling
gaps where market institutions remain weak.
During i t s 13 years history o f engagement in
Russia, the Bank Group has developed a
significant capacity for bringing i t s extensive
development knowledge and experience to bear
on the particular case o f Russia. This includes
analytical work that places the Russian
in
comparative
international
experience
perspective, institutional development in the
private sector, and project management s k i l l s
that remain valuable in the country at a time
when the government itself i s just beginning to
develop capacity for multi-year project
development, finance, and implementation. The
progress and experience o f World Bank Group
cooperation in recent years at the federal level in
areas such as governance, poverty, health, and
education can now be applied to the regional and
local levels where related needs in government
capacity are s t i l l quite strong. In infrastructure
and budgetary reform the Bank Group has
already developed substantial experience at the
subnational level. Specific areas o f the Bank
Group’s experience most applicable to the
Strategy are briefly described below.

Strategic Pillar One: Sustaining Rapid Growth
Catalyzing Investment in the Private Sector

IFC and MIGA play important role in supporting private investments globally: in FY2006
alone, IFC committed $6.7bln for 284 Projects in 66 countries and MIGA issued $1.3bln in
guarantees for 41 Projects and provided advisory services in 28-countries under 45-Projects.
IFC has accumulated huge experience in Russia: IFC has invested more that $2.9bln in 130
Projects in Russia and i t s committed portfolio in Russia reached U S $ 1.8 billion by June 2006
(largest IFC exposure). IFC mobilized an additional $583 million o f financing to Russia
through syndicated loans. In addition, IFC i s able to provide a variety o f structure finance
products and introduce new financing mechanisms that bring in other sources of capital.
IFC’s global strategic priorities include private investment in infrastructure and social services
and support to the development o f financial institutions. IFC has leveraged expertise in these
areas in Russia. For example, IFC has invested $1.8 billion in more than 90 housing finance
deals in 35 countries and has strong in-house expertise. In Russia i t i s extending this expertise
both through investment and TA to develop the primary market. PEP’S TA with banks has
resulted in 10 new residential mortgage loan products developed b y lenders as the result of

Annex 3
Page 2 o f 5
Project advisory involvement. PEP has also drafted legislation related to mortgage lending and
securitization.
Joint IFC/World Bank Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS) carried out a series of
comprehensive diagnostics of administrative barriers for business start up and operations
similar to work done in many other countries in 15 regions o f Russia.
MIGA has also gained experience in Russia and the country i s MIGA’s largest exposure with
gross outstanding coverage of US$536 million as o f June 30,2006.

Rich Experience in Supporting Business and Investment Environment
The World Bank i s one of leading organizations supporting initiatives for improved business
and investment environment in member countries through reports that can be used for country
diagnostics as well as benchmarking progress with respect to other countries: such as Doing
Business, the Bank Group’s flagship product on the quality o f government regulation (175
countries), WBI Governance Indicators (more than 200 countries); and Administrative Barrier
Assessments (more than 50 countries), Database on E C A countries on business environment
and enterprise performance. In addition, 35% o f IFC’s advisory projects globally are focused
on improvements to the business enabling environment.

Experience in Regional Development
Experience with establishing resource allocation frameworks for regional development, in EU
pre-accession and other middle-income countries, to ensure that resources reach the lagging
regions based on a set of objective and clearly understood criteria.
Developing inclusive decision-making mechanisms at the regional level that help prepare and
select projects that are responsive to the needs and priorities at that level.
Project experience for supporting fiscal and administrative decentralization, building capacity
at the local level to fully benefit from decentralization reforms.
Experience in helping design local initiatives with annual IBRD lending to sub-national
infrastructure projects with sovereign guarantees exceeding $5bln.
Municipal Fund established in 2003 leveraged $800mln in investments, and now offers loans in
20 local currencies.
Sub-National Development Program approved in 2006 allocates $600mln for subnational loans;
More recently, Bank work in China, Brazil, India, Pakistan, Mexico etc. has focused on
subnational level analysis of growth, city development strategies, and assisted in preparation of
Regional Development Strategy for Kazakhstan.
Sub-national benchmarks on the quality o f investment climate i s being created and monitored
using methodology of “Doing Business” in 3 1 states of Mexico and i t s Federal District, 9 states
o f India; and 4 provinces of Pakistan; similarly, 25 municipalities have been benchmarked for
investment climate indicators under the Municipal Scorecard program developed by IFC.

Experience in Infrastructure Investments
Infrastructure i s an important part o f the World Bank Group activities: with 30% o f the IBRD
lending in FY2006 committed for transportation, energy, and mining projects. Infrastructure i s
33% of the Bank’s total project portfolio, or about $80bln. Infrastructure accounted for about
41% of MIGA’s overall gross exposure, as o f June 30,2006.
The Bank’s Public Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) established in 1999 has
since prepared more than 200 Public Private Partnership (PPP) reviews, strategies, and legal
documents (ranging from railroads, SMEs in power generation, and solid waste); trained more
than 15,000 people on various aspects o f PPP around the world; advised 21 countries on
reforms.

Annex 3
Page 3 of 5
PPPIF manages a Database o f 3,100 projects in 150 countries, which i s a leading source o f
public-private participation in infrastructure trends. Analyses of these projects yields best
practice lessons on cross-cutting issues.
Infrastructure i s a global priority area for IFC, as adequate infrastructure i s a prerequisite for the
growth of the private sector. Since the early 1990s when IFC first became active in
infrastructure financing, private infrastructure deals worth nearly $4.8 billion have been
arranged in more than 46 developing countries. In Russia, this has been a rapidly
growing area of activity for IFC, primarily in transport infrastructure that supports
businesses operating across the Federation’s expansive territory.

INTRODUCTION

1.
The FYO3-05 CAS presented a comprehensive program o f assistance at a time when the Bank’s
relationship with the Russian Federation was undergoing a significant transformation. At the start o f the
CAS preparation process, there had been very good progress in attaining macroeconomic stability and the
economy was showing signs o f sustained growth. The Government indicated that it no longer needed
budget support but wished to avail itself more o f the Bank’s knowledge and technical expertise.
Accordingly, in the CAS, the Bank proposed considerable changes in the way we did business in Russia,
among them a greater shift to analytical and advisory activities (AAA). A number o f reports were
produced and widely disseminated that helped the Government to shape i t s development agenda,
including the quarterly Russia Economic Report, a study on the economic impact of AIDS, a Country
Economic Memorandum and a wide ranging Poverty Assessment. A Q A G review o f the Bank’s AAA
noted the very significant impact of all this work (see below). The CAS also projected a shift in the
Bank’s lending to the Russian Federation from budget support operations to a combination of investment
and technical assistance loans. Under the Base Case scenario, the CAS projected seventeen projects and a
lending volume on the order of $1.8 billion. Russia’s extraordinary growth, sound macroeconomic
management, and substantial oil revenues during the CAS period, however, obviated the need for this
level o f borrowing (see below), and thus Bank lending was somewhat lower than projected, i.e. 10
projects totaling $1.2 billion (or 12 projects for $1.4 million for the extended CAS period inclusive of
FY2006). Consistent with the improved economic prospects in Russia during the CAS period and the
need identified in the CAS for private sector investments in support of diversification, both IFC and
MIGA significantly increased their presence; Russia i s now IFC’s and MIGA’s largest country exposure.
11.

RUSSIA’S LONG TERM STRATEGIC GOALS

2.
Russia’s current formulation of i t s long term strategic goals dates from 2000 when President-tobe-Vladimir Putin asked a group o f Russian reformers to prepare a strategic plan. T h i s became known as
the “Gref Plan” (after German Gref, later the Minister o f Economic Development and Trade), and
identified a series o f reforms in virtually all areas o f the economy (and in many instances following the
recommendations o f S A L IV, which was appraised b y the Bank, but not implemented due to Russia’s
improved fiscal stance). A key milestone was laid in July 2001, when the Government began to
implement its Medium Term Program o f Social and Economic Development for 2002-2004 (MTP),
essentially a continuation o f the Gref Plan. The M T P was appropriate for addressing Russia’s
development challenges: i t was well conceived, drawing on the vision of the Gref Plan but offering
concrete proposals, and i t had the support o f Government. The Program had also been widely discussed
(and well received) in Russia. Subsequently, Mr. Putin widely announced the strategic goal o f doubling
the GDP in 10 years and halving of poverty b y 2007 that at the end o f the CAS period were followed up
with the so called national projects in health, education, housing and agriculture that are financed b y the
Government.

3.
The Medium Term Program was implemented during - and benefited from - a period o f
unprecedented growth and transformation in the Russian economy. Economic growth and overall
macroeconomic performance in Russia since 2002 have well exceeded even the CAS high case scenario
(Table 1). Three factors principally explain this performance. First, high commodity export prices,
particularly for oil and gas augmented investment resources, stimulated domestic demand, provided the
government with windfall revenues, and prevented a weakening o f the current account in the context of
rapid import growth. Second, sound macroeconomic management also played a crucial role. In 2005, the
federal budget w i l l register a surplus for the sixth consecutive year. The federal and consolidated budgets
have generated sizeable surpluses, and gross foreign reserves o f the Central Bank soared from US$35
billion to US$182 billion between January 2002 and December 2005. Third, monetary and exchange rate
policy kept both inflation and the real appreciation o f the ruble at moderate levels The consumer price
inflation has fallen throughout the period, from 15 p.a. in 2002 to 10.9 p.a. in 2005.

4.
The Medium Term Program was a prescription for deep structural change in four key areas o f the
economy. The major objectives o f the Program were: (a) reduce poverty levels and income differentials;
(b) achieve economic modernization and improvement in enterprise efficiency; (c) improve fiscal
efficiency; (d) reduce regional differentiation in social and economic development. The areas o f focus for
the FYO3-05 CAS were strongly aligned with the Government strategic goals o f growth and poverty
reduction. The CAS had three main themes: strengthening public sector management, improving the
business environment, and mitigating social and environmental risks. In retrospect, these strategic pillars
of the CAS were correctly identified, which contributed to a high degree o f Government ownership, and
remain relevant for the future Bank's work in Russia.

5.
Progress was achieved in all areas targeted by the Government, but, as could be expected, these
advances were uneven and a sustained long term implementation effort i s s t i l l needed. Throughout this
period, the Government would normally pick up one theme as a focus for a certain period o f time which
facilitated achievement o f specific results. However, eventually some o f the reforms failed to achieve
their full benefits due to incomplete implementation, bureaucratic opposition, or other implementation
bottlenecks. Examples would include, but are not limited to the pension reform, administrative reform,
reducing administrative barriers for business, tax and housing reforms. More specifically, these reforms,
accomplishments and failures include:
Reduce poverty levels and income differentials. During the CAS period living standards increased
along with growth. Labor income suffered in particular from the 1998 crisis, but recovered quickly

and has been growing strongly since 2000. The real disposable income o f households surpassed precrisis levels already in 2003. Growth has been pro-poor. Official statistics indicate that the poverty
headcount declined from a peak o f 30 percent in early 1999 to just below 16 percent in 2005.
However, these improvements concentrated in more economically vibrant parts o f Russia and

Annex C
Page 3 of 17
persistent inter and intra regional differentiation o f income continues to be a major problem for the
Government.
Achieve economic modernization and improvement in enterprise efficiency. Macroeconomic stability,
combined with key reforms in areas such as taxation and de-bureaucratization, have supported an
improvement in enterprise efficiency and created much more favorable conditions for private

investment. All three leading rating agencies have granted Russia an investment grade rating.
Greater investor confidence i s evident in an acceleration of fixed capital formation (from 2.6 percent
growth in 2002 to 10.5 percent in 2005) and in an expansion o f foreign direct investment (FDI) b y 70
percent in 2003, 39 percent in 2004, and another 39 percent in 2005. Although the higher level o f
capital investment and FDI in particular have contributed to economic modernization the relative
investment level remains rather low compared to other emerging and developing economies,
Improve fiscal efficiency. A considerably improved fiscal management has been one o f the most

important achievements o f the Government which greatly assisted the macroeconomic stabilization
and laid out a foundation for the future reform. Strict fiscal discipline has been enforced at all levels
and an ever growing Stabilization Fund, currently standing at US$ 67.2 billion, has been established
that fortunately has not been used as a substitute for implementing reforms required to achieve longterm fiscal sustainability. Progress has also been made with the introduction o f performance based
budgeting, a reduction in unfunded federal mandates, a fiscal federalism framework, improved tax
administration, a new customs code and a modern federal treasury system. A comprehensive pension
reform was initiated in 2003, with a gradual transition from a pay-as-you-go to a two-pillar system.
The pension reform, however, did not address the social and political viability of low replacement
rates, which raises concerns about the long-term sustainability o f the system. The efficiency o f public
investment remained low. While the problem was realized b y the Government, little has been done to
correct it. T h i s i s becoming even more important as the Government i s about to considerably increase
public investments.
Reduce regional diferentiation in social and economic development. Following the 1998 crisis, the
combination o f a weak ruble and huge excess capacity supported broad-based growth in the vast
majority o f Russian regions. Under these conditions, many poorer regions achieved growth in output
and living standards well above the national average. A new transfer formula also succeeded to
concentrating a larger share o f federal transfers in the poorest regions. Nevertheless, regional
disparities in Russia remain enormous and, b y some indicators, even increased during the CAS
period. N o w that the ruble i s no longer weak and capacity constraints have become tighter, the
developmental problems in many depressed regions have become greater. This will continue to pose
major policy challenges in Russia for years to come.

6.
Overall, the assessment o f the program implementation should be reasonably realistic in terms o f
how much can be achieved in each particular section o f the program under the prevailing political
conditions in Russia.

111.

CAS OUTCOMES

7.
Although the CAS was prepared under more conservative expectations about macroeconomic
conditions and growth than proved to be the case, Russia’s main challenges outlined in the latest CAS
remain highly relevant. The CAS posited Bank support to the Russian Federation along three “strategic
pillars”: strengthening public sector management, improving the business environment, and mitigating
social and environmental risks. Progress on all these pillars has been significant, albeit uneven, and
important unfinished work i s widely acknowledged.
8.
There was no explicit monitoring and evaluation embedded in the CAS, and key progress
benchmarks were not quantified. There was, however, important monitoring and evaluation in several
sub-components, e.g. poverty, civil service reform, and the business environment. And the Russia
Economic Report, which was introduced as part o f the CAS, became a reference document for Russian
and international analysts.

Annex C
Page 4 of 17
Pillar 1: Improve the business environment and enhance competition

9.
This strategic pillar was directly linked to the longer term goal o f improving economic
modernization and enterprise efficiency. Secondarily this pillar had links to poverty alleviation. An
expansion of private sector activity - and the resulting increases in growth and employment - was seen as
a key instrument in addressing the poverty in Russia. Four CAS objectives (see below) were identified.
10.
Given the combination of the Government's desire to design and implement several policy
reforms and i t s strong fiscal position, Bank instruments appropriately emphasized AAA. T h i s AAA
(which took several forms) had significant impact, in the policy realm, institutional support and direct
assistance to firms. While some Bank lending took place (partial risk guarantee, St Petersburg Economic
Development and Cadastre loans), the Government indicated less interest in using i t s sovereign guarantee
in areas where it felt the guarantee was not needed, e.g. SME development, power sector and railway
reform. Commensurate with this approach, both IFC and MIGA, increased their activities significantly.
IFC was active in promoting SME development through investment an in the financial sector and
technical assistance (see below).
Progress benchmarks: ( i ) signijcant progress towards WTO accession; ( i i ) subsidies to natural
monopolies decrease signijcantly; (iii) share of FDI and SMEs in GDP and employment increases
signijcantly; (iv) volume of commercial bank lending to SMEs increases signijcantly; (v) share of
manufacturing and services in GDP increases; (vi) deregulation package improves the regulatory
environment as measured in enteqrise survey; (vii) GovemmentKentral Bank program j n a n c i a l sector
reform program on track.

11.
Remove administrative barriers to business activity and investment. Evidence o f progress i s
somewhat contradictory. Surveys o f small businesses on administrative barriers indicate noticeable
progress. In recent years, Russian firms needed to apply for a fewer number of licenses. Licenses have
also become easier to obtain, and remain valid for a longer period o f time. However, the number of
illegitimate licenses s t i l l remains high, accounting for 33% o f the total. The number o f various inspections
to which Russian firms are subjected has declined by over 20 percent. Registration o f new businesses has
become easier. The average number of offices visited for registration decreased from 5 to 4, and the
average length o f the registration process has become shorter. The monetary costs o f registration have
increased, however. The World Bank Group's Doing Business 2005 Report places Russia in the top (best)
40 percentile o f all countries. Russia rates particularly well relative to other countries in the region in the
ease of registering a new business, resolving a bankruptcy, and hiring and firing workers. However, the
Doing Business data also suggest particular weaknesses in the disclosure o f information and in indicators
related to access to credit. Also, as FIAS regional surveys illustrate, procedures related to access to land
and real estate do not yet show any improvement in transparency or efficiency, and instead show
considerable evidence of inconsistent application of complex procedures, which appear to deter land
privatization in practice.
12.
Notwithstanding progress on many components o f the business environment, Russia's relative
standing relative to other transition economies in the region worsened between 2002 and 2005. In 2002,
out of 21 indicators monitored b y the Bank/EBRD Business Environment and Enterprise Performance
Survey (BEEPS), Russia was lower than average for the rest o f the region in only five (licensing, access
to land, registering land title, tax administration, and labor skills). B y 2005 Russia had not only failed to
improve on these indicators but scored lower than the rest o f the region on five additional indicators:
policy uncertainty, macroeconomic risk (exchange rate), theft, organized crime and corruption
13.
The Bank provided extensive support for investment climate monitoring through a survey (run b y
the Center for Economic and Financial Research - CEFIR) that monitors administrative barriers to
business activity. I t also informed the investment community o f regular improvements in the investment
climate due to implementation o f the Government's "de-bureaucratization'' package. Investment climate
diagnostics in 10 Russian regions, coordinated b y the Foreign Investment Advisory Service o f the Bank
and IFC, have helped to develop regional strategies for improving the business climate. WBI provided
essential support to these efforts in the regions. The Bank's flagship analytical product, the Russia

Annex C
Page 5 of 17
Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) 2004 From Transition to Development, was devoted to the
analysis o f constraints on economic development and competition in Russia. The Bank also regularly
published the Russia Economic Report (RER). Due to i t s broad dissemination, the RER’s views on
economic developments and reforms have received major attention from federal and regional authorities,
the business community, think-tanks and academia, and the media.

14.
At the macro level, there has also been good progress in negotiations for WTO accession, which
i s currently envisaged in 2007. The Bank provided support to the Government, especially in developing
economic models of the impact of WTO membership. WBI aided this effort through high-impact training
activities such as Trade and W T O course, to organizing top-level policy events with the Cabinet o f
Ministers aimed at fostering policy dialogue on the competitiveness and diversification o f Russian
economy.
15.
Enterprise support.
Notwithstanding the Government’s efforts at making the business
environment more favorable to SMEs, their participation in the economy i s s t i l l quite low. Some evidence
(for example, from surveys in St Petersburg, Russia’s second largest city) suggests that the number o f
SMEs i s increasing, albeit from a very low base. Other studies cite poor links between universities,
research centers and firms as a reason for the low participation o f SMEs. T h i s lower than expected
presence o f SMEs in the economy may also be due to the circumstances surrounding recent economic
growth, where a highly undervalued ruble and excess capacity contributed to strong export demand and
gave new l i f e to newly restructured, yet well established, large enterprises. The remaining soft budget
constraints to large incumbent enterprises also helped many o f them to stay afloat. The low enterprise exit
rate distinguishes Russia from other transition economies, depriving Russian start-ups o f potential access
to cheap assets, and thus hiders their creation and growth.
16.
Project support to enterprise development by the Bank has been less successful. The Enterprise
Support project inherited from previous CAS periods was closed in 2003 with substantially reduced scope
despite radical project restructuring after the 1998 financial crisis. Later, the Bank provided a partial risk
guarantee for the coal and forestry sectors, however approval delays made this facility not very attractive
to businesses as access to private capital had significantly improved during that period and the guarantee
had to be eventually cancelled. At the same time both IFC and MIGA substantially expanded their
activities in Russia.
17.
IFC increased its activities in Russia, with an average commitment level for the CAS period
reaching $588 million, almost six times the FYOO-02 average. Russia i s now IFC’s largest country
exposure, with a committed portfolio of 1.97 billion (as o f June 30, 2006). Investments in financial
institutions have represented b y far the largest share o f this investment (on average half o f new
commitments each year). T h i s reflects IFC’s strategy to reach a broad number o f companies across a
diverse number of sectors, in particular SMEs, through financial intermediaries as described further
below. In the real sector, IFC catalyzed foreign direct investment and supported local companies in a wide
range o f sectors, reflecting the CAS objective to create conditions for diversification o f the economy in
order to reduce over-reliance on the natural resource sectors. Manufacturing and services remained a
significant area of focus, with 26% of new commitment volume supporting twelve projects involving
foreign investment in manufacturing sectors ranging from forestry-based construction materials to white
good productions and service sectors including retail and hotel services. Addressing the CAS objective of
upgrading infrastructure, transport infrastructure became a significant new sector for IFC in Russia during
the CAS period with 11% o f new commitments for nine projects with private companies (all Russianowned), operating transport b y rail, sea, and air. About 8% of new commitments went to the oil,
chemical and mining sectors, with a combination o f foreign and local companies. The rest o f new
commitments were in agribusiness, IT/media, and funds. In general, a significant increase in the portion
of funding going to Russian-owned companies reflects the recommendation made in the Country Impact
Review to increase efforts to finance Russian companies.
18.
In technical assistance, as planned in the CAS, IFC supported enterprises through the Private
Enterprise Partnership’s (PEP’) work with almost 2000 companies in St. Petersburg, Rostov-on-Don,

Annex C
Page 6 of 17
Yekaterinburg, Samara, and Moscow to improve their corporate governance practices. PEP surveyed 129
of these clients and found that 80% had made at least one corporate governance improvement, and those
surveyed had already attracted more than $280 million in additional investment and attributed this
substantially to corporate governance improvements. On the national level, the program worked with
Russia’s Federal Securities Commission to draft and distribute Russia’s first national corporate
governance code and with the Russian Parliament on six different laws and regulations related to
corporate governance. T h i s work on the federal level was done in coordination with the OECD, World
Bank and Global Corporate Governance Forum. The program also sought to raise public awareness o f
the importance of good corporate governance and the protection o f shareholders’ rights and worked with
24 educational institutions to introduce corporate governance topics into law and management courses.
Through PEP, IFC also supported companies in key sectors, including forestry, IT, automotive
component suppliers, and mining to better meet the need o f their buyers and to attract investment.
19.
MIGA provided guarantees to support investment in the financial, water, mining, manufacturing
and agribusiness sectors. I t also worked with several regions o f Russia on the development o f their
investment promotion capacity. Russia i s currently MIGA’s largest exposure. As o f June 2006, the
Agency’s net exposure in Russia was US$211 million, or about 6.4% o f the total net exposure.
20.
MIGA has been working with local officials and regional investment promotion agencies to
identify opportunities to stimulate FDI and increase local economic benefits through supporting image
building for the regions, investor servicing and investor outreach and targeted marketing to revitalize
existing industry. A MIGA pilot project to generate projects from Russian companies investing in CIS
countries was implemented to build a pipeline o f South-South guarantees. The project aimed at
stimulating private business activity o f Russian companies and strengthening their competitive advantage.
2 1.
Restructure priority sectors (infrastructure monopolies, housing and communal services) and
privatize agricultural land. Progress has been mixed. The Government launched a housing and communal
services reform in 2003 that i s now gaining momentum. In general there has been good progress in land
and real estate markets, with important support from Bank loans in support of land registration and the
real estate market. Both urban and agricultural land can now be sold, and land markets are emerging in
large cities. As a result of the LARIS project (US$SO million), some 14 percent of all the rayons in Russia
were supplied with automated land registration systems and about 90 percent of all land in those rayons i s
now inventoried for purposes o f the state cadastre. Over 60 percent o f all cadastre enterprises were
supplied with modem digital equipment. The recently approved Cadastre project (US$lOO million) and
Registration project (US$50 million) will extend these achievements throughout Russia and w i l l link
them with modernized property registration. In the same vein, the St. Petersburg Economic Development
project (US$161.1 million) i s supporting the development o f the land and real estate market in the city.
22.
Progress in the area o f natural monopolies, however, has been more limited. Though tariffs are
being gradually increased toward long-run marginal costs, price subsidies remain substantial. A strategy
was been approved for reforming the electricity sector in which potentially competitive parts of the
generation and distribution systems are to be unbundled from RAO UES (United Energy Systems - the
national electricity monopoly), but implementation, though with some TA assistance from the Electricity
Sector Reform Project, has been slow due to political reasons and opposition in the Parliament. A similar
restructuring has been developed for the railway system, and i s in the initial stage o f implementation.
However, there i s still no progress in the reform of Gazprom, the natural gas monopoly. The Bank
provided advice on these restructurings, through implementation of existing loans and policy notes. While
new loans in support o f the sectoral reforms were discussed with the Government (though not in the case
of Gazprom), the Government decided not to seek Bank financing.
23.
Bottlenecks o f the communal services sector has been dealt with through the already closed
Enterprise Housing Divestiture project and on-going Municipal Heating and Municipal Water projects.
However, the implementation progress has been slow due to the design susceptible to regional
creditworthiness risks, cumbersome on-lending arrangements with multiple medium and small size cities,
introduction o f private operators for water facilities in the middle o f the project, etc. Also, recent federally
mandated caps on tariff increases created certain risks for the cost recovery of these largely municipal

Annex C
Page 7 of 17
enterprises. The implementation of the housing reform will be further supported b y the Housing and
Communal Services project that w i l l combine a competitive grant scheme for more reform oriented
regions with the subsequent implementation o f investment programs in wining regions.
24.
Improve financial intermediation. During the CAS the Bank sought to develop a stronger
relationship with the Central Bank o f Russia, in a joint FSAP with the IMF, and follow-up primarily
through informal, “just-in-time’’ advice. T h i s was appropriate given the state o f the financial sector in
Russia and the lack of interest in the Government for a financial sector loan.

The Government’s banking sector reform program i s now in i t s fourth year. The program
25.
accelerated substantially after the approval o f an ambitious revised reform agenda b y the Government in
July 2004. T h i s was followed by the Duma’s approval o f several important amendments to laws,
including changes in bankruptcy procedures for banks, the strengthening o f the Central Bank’s
enforcement powers, and measures to smooth the transition to a deposit insurance system. In general, the
Russian banlung sector has been developing at a rapid pace. Growth in commercial bank assets, capital,
and credit has well outpaced GDP growth. According to the CBR, between January 2001 and January
2005, commercial bank assets increased from 32 to 42 percent of GDP, aggregate bank capital from 4 to 6
percent, and outstanding credit to the non-financial sector from 11 to 18 percent (to be updated S.Ulatov). A particularly rapid expansion o f longer-term lending reflects growing activity o f commercial
banks in financing fixed capital investment, although the share o f bank credit in investment finance i s s t i l l
below 6 percent.
26.
Despite the recent growth, the level o f financial intermediation in Russia remains low in absolute
terms, and creating a stable and effective private banking sector will require substantial additional effort
and determination on the part o f the CBR and the Government in future years. This includes addressing
the weaknesses o f the bank resolution process, continuing strengthening o f the supervisory framework,
and improving the balance between private and state-owned banks. Delays in the privatization o f stateowned banks remain a cause for concern, as these delays slow improvements in the efficiency o f financial
intermediation in Russia.
27.
In spite o f the continuing domination o f the sector b y state-owned institutions, IFC was able to
play a significant role in the development o f private financial institutions. IFC committed $850 million to
20 banking and leasing projects during the CAS period. As planned in the CAS, most o f these projects
were with medium-sized banks, particularly those with SME clients. IFC was able to introduce more
advanced financial products to local banks, such as subordinated debt and local currency finance. IFC i s
also providing the smaller regional banks with advisory services on corporate governance through PEP
with a focus on special topics such as Base1 2 and operational risk management. A number o f the pilot
banks in the IFC PEP program are already implementing key corporate governance changes and attracting
investment. In addition, the project has provided advisory assistance to the Ministry for Economic Trade
and Development for the development o f a new law on the corporate registrar system.
28.
The promotion o f new products, including housing finance and leasing, has also followed the
lines of the CAS. During the CAS period, IFC also began to play a large role in the housing finance
market, supporting banks with both financing and TA, as well as providing advice to create the conditions
for securitizations. The housing finance TA provided through PEP has consolidated industry efforts b y
creating a working group o f over 74 stakeholders to identify key issues in the Russian mortgage industry
and jointly develop solutions. The PEP housing finance project, for example, has created the first standard
mortgage note which i s presently being tested b y pilot banks and government agencies.
29.
Technical assistance for leasing i s mostly completed, but investments have continued, with five
investments in the CAS period including one focused on the Russian Far East and Siberia. In leasing,
consumer lending, and housing finance, IFC made two large loans to international banks to expand the
operation of their Russian subsidiaries, bringing international expertise and best practice to the market.
One area that was not initially identified in the CAS, but later became part of IFC’s strategy in the
Russian financial sector, was to support the privatization o f state-owned banks through pre-privatization

Annex C
Page 8 of 17
investments. Unfortunately, these privatizations did not proceed, and IFC has discontinued this strategy
for the time being.
30.
Another new area o f advisory work in the financial sector i s energy efficiency; PEP has launched
a program combining dedicated IFC credit lines for energy efficiency with technical assistance. The first
credit line for energy efficiency allocated under the program in Southern Russia in FY06 i s already fully
disbursed to sub-projects. A number of banks are expected to become a part o f this program during the
new CAS period.

Pillar 2: Improve Public Sector Management
31.
This strategic pillar was linked to the Government’s goals o f economic modernization and fiscal
efficiency. The Government was clear in i t s intention to strengthen and transform government as an
integral part of a modem market economy. The correctly focused on key federal level agencies where
there was an appetite for reform and a need for sound project implementation. Key CAS objectives are
highlighted below.
32.
Both Bank lending and AAA played an important role. On the former, the Bank correctly focused
on a number of federal level functions (tax, treasury, customs, and fiscal federalism) where there was both
an appetite for reform and a desire for Bank loan. A relatively small. amount o f lending resulted in a large
(scaled up) impact. With respect to tax reform and fiscal federalism this work built on previously
successful Bank loans that piloted reform in selected regions. AAA was also important, but the Bank
probably underestimated the difficulty and very long term horizon o f the most significant effort at
improving public sector management, i.e. civil service reform.
Progress benchmarks: ( i ) implementation of civil service reform: action plan published before end-2002;
( i i ) allowance for civil service reform costs in 2003-05 budgets; ( i i i ) enterprise and household surveys
demonstrate signijkant improvement in transparency and quality of public services; (iv) continues
improvements in tax and customs administration as measured by tax receipts and public perception; ( v )
decrease in the amount of unfunded mandates over time; (vi) regional fiscal reforms on track

33.
Strengthen and modernize civil service and governance capacity. The Government undertook a
massive restructuring during the CAS period. For sheer scope the change i s notable though i t w i l l be
several years before the reform can be considered complete. The federal program for Reforming Civil
Service in Russia (2003-2005) comprised a comprehensive set o f measures aimed at strengthening the
civil service. I t led to the adoption o f the federal laws, e.g. On the System o f the Civil Service o f the
Russian Federation (2003) and On the Civil Public Service of the Russian Federation (2004), which
introduced a number of new principles, such as a performance-based pay scheme, merit-based promotion,
and a contractual system. A reform of the remuneration system in the civil service was launched in 20022004, and i s well financed by the federal budget. The GRICS indicator o f Government effectiveness has
revealed a steady improvement in Russia over the last three years. The Bank, together with DFID,
provides extensive TA support to the ongoing reform effort.
34.
However, large scale restructuring of the government attempting to delineate policy, supervision
and implementation functions among respectively ministries, services and agencies, in a short run created
a havoc in government administration b y complicated already quite lengthy bureaucratic processes, with
resulting difficulties for the implementation o f the Bank supported portfolio. Subsequently, some o f these
teething implementation difficulties had dissipated, however the principles o f the reforms were in some
cases sacrificed as ministries resisted relinquishing implementation functions, while some agencies and
services re-acquired legislative and policy functions.
35.
Improve fiscal management at national and subnational level. The Government has undertaken a
major improvement in subnational finance, and has developed an effective federal level fiscal instrument
for supporting economic, budgetary and fiscal improvements at the regional level. T h i s includes broadranging reforms in fiscal and asset management, budget execution, and more transparent transfer and tax
sharing systems. T h i s has been supported b y an innovative Fiscal Federalism and Regional Fiscal Reform

Annex C
Page 9 of 17
loan (US$120 million), in which the Regional Fiscal Reform Fund provided incentive-based fiscal grants
to fifteen participating regions that have implemented broad-ranging reforms in fiscal and asset
management, budget execution, and more transparent transfer and tax sharing systems At the national
level, performance based budgeting i s being introduced with support from the Bank. WBI aided this effort
through i t s on-going capacity building program on intergovernmental fiscal relations, and expanded i t
further to Russian regions, shifting the emphasis to the municipal finance and budget execution issues. A
recent first investment by the IFC Municipal Fund in the form o f partial credit guarantee to support a
bond issued b y Chuvash Republic for i t s key infrastructure investments w i l l further support the
development o f subnational finance.
36.
The government has also worked to reduce unfunded mandates. A special new federal transfer
fund, the Compensation Fund was created in 2001 to provide financial support to regions for carrying out
important federal mandates ranging from transportation, healthcare, housing and communal services
benefits. The number of mandates covered b y this fund has steadily increased. New amendments to the
Budget Code now require any law that mandates expenditures to be the financial responsibility o f the
level o f government from which the law emanated. On the other hand, an ambitious reform in intergovernmental relations, due for implementation in 2005 and 2006, increases the financial (expenditure)
responsibilities of sub-national governments. Although the underlying principle o f this reform i s to give
regional and local authorities control over these expenditures, the new laws also contain some ambiguous
sections that might be interpreted as limiting this control.
37.
Tax, Treasury and Customs are three Government agencies that received Bank loans to assist the
Government in the development and upgrade o f i t s administrative, methodological and human capacity to
deliver core Government functions. Overall financing for these core functions totals US$470 million and
includes technical support to three key federal agencies. The Tax Modernization loan (US$99 million) i s
helping the authorities to launch a country-wide modernization effort that i s based on an earlier pilot
program (also supported by the Bank), which reduced taxpayer waiting time b y a factor o f 5 and a reply
period from 2 weeks to 1-4 days. The Customs Development loan (US$140 million) pilots ways to
accelerate customs clearance -- and hence improve trade facilitation b y Customs -- while improving the
efficiency o f collecting fiscal revenues. The Treasury Development loan (US$23 1 million) assists the
Government in increasing the efficiency o f processing budget flows and in improving financial control
over them.
38.
The Bank assistance to public expenditure management resulted in a better quality o f the federal
budget preparation in terms o f proper accounting for and costing of existing expenditure commitments.
The outcomes of this work included: (i)amendments to the Budget Code that provided the legal basis for
expenditure budgeting including a revised approach to existing and new expenditure commitments; (ii)
M O F internal regulations on the revised budgeting procedures; (iii)a core group o f senior and middle
level M O F officials trained in modem budgeting techniques. Assistance has also been provided in support
of the performance budgeting reform implementation.
Pillar 3: Mitigating social and environmental risks

39.
This strategic pillar was linked to the long term goals o f poverty alleviation and reduction in
regional differences. Progress has been mixed for each of the four CAS objectives (see below). Both the
goals and the pillar are expansive in scope and thus suffer to some degree from a lack o f specification.
They also address a large range o f topics that are deeply sensitive in Russia, e.g. the provision o f health
care by the state, the nature o f the education system, the desirability o f internal and international
migration, institutional care o f children, alcoholism, stranded populations (especially in the Northern
Siberia), and the Soviet environmental legacy. The degree o f difficulty in solving these problems i s
significantly greater and longer term in nature than either o f the other strategic pillars in the CAS.
In retrospect, the very large and difficult environmental agenda and the difficult institutional
40.
relationship with one key actor (Ministry o f Natural Resources) should have led the Bank to focus more
on the prior consensus building and policy analysis o f the sort done in the Bank’s Child Welfare and
Adult Health, HIV/AIDS, Poverty Assessment, and Forestry studies. Bank lending was more successful

Annex C
Page 10 of 17
when based on a well-established dialogue (Education) or when responding to a specific, well conceived
request from the Government (Hydromet Modernization loan).
Progress benchmarks: ( i ) reduction of incidence and depth of poverty; ( i i ) equity of access to and quality
of education and health care are improved; (iii) effective steps taken to arrest further acceleration in TB
and HIV epidemics; ( i i i ) development of regionalllocal social welfarekare services initiated; (iv)
improved targeting and administration of social protection benefits; ( v ) work program for poverty
measurement, monitoring and analysis on track as per MOU between Bank, DFID, Goskomstat and
Ministry of Labor; (vi) implementation of work program and action matrix for poverty measurement,
monitoring and analysis over the next four years; (vii) progress towards sustainable pension reform;
(viii) improved environmental management; (viii) increased protection of forests and protected areas; (ix)
decrease in energy intensity of GDP; (x) reduction in carbon emissions; (xi) better access to water and
sanitation.

41.
Mitigate environmental risks and support the global commons. Though evidence o f progress i s
beginning to emerge, development and implementation o f clear policies was impeded b y frequent
administrative changes and decentralization of key oversight functions with inadequate planning. The
new service for environmental compliance and enforcement remains fundamentally understaffed and the
system works unevenly. However, an environment management review completed b y the Bank in 2004
concluded that most environmental indicators (water quality, emissions) have improved over the last five
years with the exception of those related to the increase in use o f automobiles and accumulation o f
wastes. The energy intensity o f GDP i s unlikely to decrease as vehicle ownership rises, though improved
energy efficiency in heating systems w i l l have a positive impact.
42.
Through AAA the Bank has been assisting with piloting a river basin management and water
quality monitoring system which i s broadly consistent with the EU Water Framework Directive. The
US$% million National Pollution Abatement Facility, supported by the Bank, i s reducing pollution in a
number o f enterprises, particularly in the pulp and paper and energy sectors, however the scope o f the
project has been lower than anticipated. And work has begun on an approach to addressing environmental
liability in the chemical sector, which i s linked also to responsible private sector development.
43.
The Bank i s supporting an operation to improve weather forecasting in Russia with a US$ 80
million loan; because o f Russia’s size this operation has global as well as national benefits and w i l l help
reduce the economic and social costs o f weather-related events. The Forestry loan i s also assisting with
improved forest fire management and better forest management and certification. There have been long
delays, however, in processing two GEF grants, one which would address fire management in globally
significant ecosystems in the Russian Far East managed for conservation rather than commercial
production, and a second which would pilot improved agricultural practices to reduce non-point pollution
flows into the Black Sea in Krasnodar Kray, Russia’s most important agricultural region. Consultations
are underway on ways to simplify the Government approval procedures for grants to allow Russia to
benefit from these available grant resources and TA.
44.
Concerning the global environmental agenda, there has been some progress though there i s still
much to be done. Russia, which used to be one o f the world’s largest producers o f ozone depleting
substances, successfully phased out their production and consumption with the help o f a GEF grant and a
multi-donor trust fund o f US$ 71 million. With regard to global warming, Russia signed the Kyoto
Protocol, a major step forward, but has yet to put in place the institutional mechanisms which will permit
enterprises to invest in reduced emissions technologies with the benefit o f carbon trading schemes. The
Bank i s working closely with Russian authorities and enterprises on the development o f Green Investment
Schemes.
45.
Improve health status, services and finance. Significant progress was achieved in the design o f
public health insurance and the restructuring of the health service delivery system. Bank support to
Government reform in health sector focused on two main themes: (i)helping Russia establish a health
care system that i s accessible, affordable, and efficient, and (ii)strengthening the public policy response
to premature mortality and the risks of HIV/AIDS. These came after earlier World Bank support to the

Annex C
Page 11 of 17
health sector that was aimed at initial rehabilitation and arresting the health sector decline. Also,
discussions were initiated on the design of public policy response to demographic challenges that Russia
i s facing due to premature male mortality Through the Health Reform Implementation Loan (US$30
million) the Bank i s assisting the Government to design and pilot methods o f health sector restructuring,
new financing mechanisms and medical protocols. WBI developed a Health Flagship course to improve
the capacity o f mid- to high-level health sector officials and managers to design and implement reforms in
the sector, and particularly for health care financing. The Bank i s supporting implementation by the
Government of i t s Strategy on the Prevention and Control o f Social Diseases. The “just-in-time” work on
HIV/AIDS was well received and now serves as a reference for policy makers. The Bank, in cooperation
with UN Agencies and NGOs, initiated a Business Summit on HIV/AIDS which brought together
representatives o f the Russian Government and the local and international business community, and
resulted in agreement on further joint actions to combat AIDS in Russia. Bank lending in support of
TB/AIDS prevention and treatment was more problematic. A US$150 million loan was approved with
delays and had had difficulties during the initial implementation.
46.
Improve reliance and delivery o f modem educational services. The Government took a significant
decision to shift to a Unified State University entry exam, which w i l l improve access to higher education
for the low income and rural population. The Russian Federation also joined the Bologna process in
support of an integrated European educational space, which i s expected to improve the relevance and
quality o f higher education. The education sector the Bank has successfully supported (i)reform of
university level social science education, (ii)development o f secondary school textbook provision
(Education Innovation Project, US$70 million), and (iii)development and piloting o f regional models for
secondary education upgrade (Education Reform Project, US$50 million). Some 75 new textbook titles
have been introduced and over 20 million copies distributed across the country. However, no monitoring
and evaluation mechanism has been created to track the textbooks quality. However, the subsequent ELearning in Schools project (US$lOO million) has been extremely successful in ensuring better access to
quality education for students in several remote destinations, while the Education Reform Project piloted
restructuring mechanisms for the secondary education in three participating regions.
47.
Mitigate income insecurity, vulnerability and risk o f poverty. Russia’s recent impressive
economic growth has been pro-poor and has significantly reduced risk o f poverty, with the poverty rate
halving over the CAS period. Efforts to improve targeting have been less successful. Poor implementation
of the monetization o f some social benefits in the beginning o f 2005 (lack o f consultation, delays in
payments) led to widespread protests and concerns about implementing future nation-wide social reforms.
The Bank was supportive of the monetization reform and i s continuing working at the sub-national level
on better targeting social assistance. With the city o f Kazan, through the Kazan Municipal Development
project ($125 million), the Bank works to better target and deliver monetized social benefits. With the
Tomsk oblast, the Bank has launched a broad program aiming at improving efficiency of the regional
poverty alleviation strategy. Also, work i s being launched on improving targeting o f social assistance in
six subjects o f the federation, with a potential to scale up efficient practices to other regions.
48.
A Bank-Government effort to improve monitoring and analytical capacity in the public sector,
however, has been very successful, including a multi-year project on Improving Measurement,
Monitoring, and Analysis of Poverty.
49.
The Bank also collaborated with the Government on the design o f upgraded social assistance and
on reforms of social service provision for the vulnerable groups (poor, children at risk and residents o f the
North). The Bank completed an analysis of the employment support and labor market developments.
Child welfare policies at the regional level were studied and a large program o f capacity building and
interventions on issues o f modern child welfare were completed. WBI worked closely with the British
Council on the youth and governance issues following a special request from the Russian Ministry of
Labor and Social development. The Northern Restructuring Pilot Project (US$80 million) i s providing
support out-migration from the North. I t allows reducing budget expenditures on supporting relocation o f
about 25,000 people from the three Northern regions and helps develop a public scheme for improved
labor mobility. Implementation o f the project, however, has been slow. The completed Community Social
Infrastructure Project (US$150 million) developed and tested a model regional social infrastructure

Annex C
Page 12 of 17
development fund. The project was successful and some o f the lessons may be used in the design o f the
Southern Okrug Local Initiatives Support program planned for the next CAS period. And, finally, the
Bank has been a major provider o f financing for investment for water and sanitation (Municipal Water
project; US$122 million).While no specific scaling up has taken place, the lessons learned have been well
disseminated and there i s now evidence o f an improved service standards and financial capacity in water
utilities throughout Russia.

MEASURING BANK PERFORMANCE

111.

Changing the way we do business
50.
Taking into account lessons outlined in the Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE) for Russia, and
in the context o f middle-income country (MIC) approach, the CAS proposed new ways for doing business
in Russia to increase the relevance and impact o f the Bank's work.3 Progress was made, yet the business
model requires continuous evaluation and adjustment to meet the needs o f our clients. Key CAS
benchmarks included the following:
51.
Strengthen analytical work. The CAS envisaged an increase in the role o f AAA in the Russia
program. A variety o f AAA instruments were provided, e.g. Poverty Assessment, fiduciary reports,
policy notes, sector reports, and the quarterly Russia Economic Report. This strengthened the dialogue at
the sector level and helped to position the Bank as an independent and technically sound voice in the
public debate on economic reform. The Q A G has prepared the Country AAA assessment for Russia, and
assigned an overall satisfactory rating (see below). Strategic relevance, internal quality, and dialogue and
dissemination were all judged highly satisfactory.
52.
Develop monitoring capacity: Phase Io f the joint Bank-Government program for improving the
Measurement, Monitoring, and Analysis o f Poverty in Russia was successfully completed in June 2004,
and the Poverty Assessment Report was submitted to the Government. The BEEPS and FIAS surveys
contributed to a deeper understanding of the business environment.
53.
Select effective lending instruments. As foreseen in the CAS, Russia successfully transitioned
away from borrowing for balance o f payments support. But Bank lending changed in ways that were also
not foreseen in the CAS. With the Government wary o f utilizing i t s sovereign guarantee, loans for
sectoral reform (e.g. railways, agriculture) did not materialize loans nor did lines o f credit for SME
development. Bank lending, however, did respond expeditiously to specific requests from the
Government, for example on two loans for support to specific regions (St Petersburg and Kazan), as well
as projects in support o f the cadastre and hydrometeorological services. The Government has also looked
for a more strategic use o f Bank lending instruments, consistent with their improved fiscal stance. They
are exploring ways to drastically increase Government financing o f projects, and to replicate successful
lending models (e.g. the competitive grants scheme in the Regional Fiscal Federalism loan) to programs
in other sectors (e.g. Housing and Communal Services Reform). Consistent with this more strategic use
of lending instruments, there was remarkable growth in IFC and MIGA projects.
54.
Improve outreach. The sheer size o f Russia, as well as i t s federal political structure, means that
many development challenges are locally based. Developing more effective tools for knowledge sharing
across the breadth o f Russia i s a key challenge. A number o f initiatives were pursued, including

building relations with other donors, e.g. in the Southern Okrug;
extending collaboration with civil society, including the N G O Advisory Council, youth and
disabled groups;
improving communication with the business community, including a Memorandum o f
Understanding with a large Russian private sector group on greater information sharing;

The CAE's findings were discussed in the CAS 2002.

greater use of Russian researchers and think-tanks in analytical work (e.g. the CEM, the Poverty
Assessment, etc.) and joint launchings o f flagship publications and other key research;
improving the availability o f all AAA on the country website and extending access to all Regions
via a regular bulletin on the Bank’s activities;
periodic press briefings, and the publication o f op-ed pieces in leading newspapers;
expanding the operations o f the Public Information Center (PIC), in collaboration with the UN
and Russian universities
And IFC’s PEP advisory projects in corporate governance, business development in the Russian
Far East, leasing and mortgage finance all include significant components for public education
through media and work with education institutions

55.
In addition to the Banks AAA program, the World Bank Institute (WBI) expanded outreach in
knowledge sharing and capacity building. WBI played an important role in supporting dissemination of
the Bank reports, and in creating a platform for policy dialogue and consensus building in important areas
such as fiscal decentralization, child welfare, support to SME development, civil service reform, gender
mainstreaming, and poverty. The Distance Learning Center located in the Moscow office, however, has
been underutilized.

Recommendations f r o m the CAS Progress Report
56.
The CASPR proposed several improvements to the way o f doing business in Russia for remaining
CAS period (extended to 2006) in light o f strengthening o f the economy and deceasing borrowing needs.
In particular, the CASPR suggested (i)
increasing the Banks direct cooperation and assistance with
(ii)providing more flexible lending
regions which face significant development challenges;
modalities;(iii) exploring establishment o f Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs); (iv) supporting Russia’s
global commitments, including G8 Chairmanship and Kyoto Protocol, and in general (v) greater
flexibility and expediency in the organization of AAA work. These recommendations have been
followed up:

the IFC Municipal Fund has recently finalized i t s first operation in Russia directly with
Chuvashia Oblast and i s considering few additional opportunities. In addition, the C E M that was
initiated in 2005 will focus on Overcoming Barriers to Regional Growth and Development.
new projects under preparation are designed for the Bank’s funds to leverage significant larger
Government investments using the Banks project implementation and monitoring capacity, and
most o f new projects are based on PPP approach (IT and Techno Parks);
a series o f capacity building and technical assistance activities related to Russia’s G8 presidency
are completed and/or under way, including a week long orientatioddebriefing “G8 and
development” for twelve key Russian G8 officials and experts in Washington; “A Window on
G8” reference guide and policy notes on Education and Knowledge Economy, Access to Energy,
Global Economic Imbalances; a training course on Report Writing for Russian G8 experts and
officials completed. The Bank has also assisted in development of a regulatory framework for
financing o f low-carbon technologies and in preparation o f a project pipeline in this regards;
the Bank has continued providing just-in-time advisory services to the Government as requested
and maintained a productive dialogues with most of the line ministries.

Quality of products and services
57.
AAA . As noted above, during the CAS period Q A G completed an assessment o f the Bank’s
analytical and advisory activities. The assessment was based on the review o f a sample of major nonlending activities in each o f the CAS strategic areas. The Q A G Assessment acknowledged high value of
the Bank’s independent judgment and perspectives, and i t s success in bringing global knowledge to
Russia. According to interviews with clients, a large number o f changes in legislation, in the objectives
and design o f institutions, in policies and in practical measures reflected the good quality and positive
impact o f the Bank’s analysis, advice or facilitation. A situation, which could well have deteriorated into
the Bank being relegated to simply supervising i t s portfolio, evolved to one where now the Bank i s a

Annex C
Page 14 of 17
respected development partner and has garnered a great deal o f appreciation for i t s commitment and
efforts. As a result o f these efforts, the Bank i s also well positioned to resume a more significant lending
role if there i s a cyclical downturn in natural resource prices in the medium-term.

58.
Lending. The CAS projected 17 loans totaling $1.8 billion over the three year period; 10 projects
were approved with $1.2 billion in new commitments. T h i s shortfall i s due to the improved economic
environment in Russia, in which the Government developed large fiscal surpluses and international
market access. In some cases the borrowing plans in the CAS were premature, reflecting ideas and design
concepts that needed more discussion and reflection within the Government, e.g. Housing and Communal
Services, Science and Technology, and Judicial Reform. In some cases these projects w i l l be taken up in
the next CAS. In FY 06 four new projects - STASYS 2, Southern Okrug, Adult Health, Microfinance,
and one RAO EUS guarantee were added to the existing pipeline with $US165 million in new
commitments. Though borrowing has decreased, the Government has indicated a desire to continue
borrowing to avail itself o f the Bank’s expertise in project design and control, and to utilize the Bank’s
procurement and financial management systems.
59.
Portfolio. The Russia IBRD program entered the current CAS cycle with a portfolio o f 31 active
projects, $2.6 billion in net commitments and a 77 percent satisfactory portfolio rating. The current
portfolio consists o f 22 projects, $1.95 billion in net commitments,. Since the beginning o f the CAS
period, important steps have jointly been taken b y the Government and the Bank to improve portfolio
management and coordination. Portfolio management has focused on closing older projects, improving
reporting and monitoring, incorporating quality at entry (e.g. avoiding cumbersome sub-loan agreements),
and improving quality at exit (improving the “disconnect” on final project ratings). The Bank has
strengthened supervision efforts through further decentralization o f operations, increasing communication
with PIUs and relevant Government agencies, and by establishing a disbursement and procurement
monitoring system. As a result, the share o f satisfactory projects has improved and stands at 95 percent;
well above the CAS trigger o f 70 percent of satisfactory projects and the actual 77 percent rating at the
start of the CAS. Significantly, project implementation pace has recently picked up and the disbursement
ratio has improved from an average 11 percent over the last 6 years to 15.7 percent in FY06. The average
processing time for new operations from Board approval to effectiveness was reduced from 12 to 7.6
months slightly exceeding the CAS trigger of 8 months.
60.
Notwithstanding these improvements, portfolio management remains a difficult and managementintensive task. Loan processing within the Government remains highly labor and time consuming and
further efforts w i l l be needed to speed up loadgrant approval to enable Bank supported projects to timely
respond to the Government priorities. Despite improvements, the disbursement pace trails the Bank-wide
and ECA averages o f 24 and 17 per cent respectively for FY06. W h i l e the frequency o f project extensions
slightly reduced further concerted efforts will be needed to complete projects on time. In this regard the
Bank i s committed to continue its efforts in expediting project preparation, decentralizing its operations,
raising to the extent possible financial threshold per procurement methods and prior review thresholds,
and responding in an operative way to client’s needs.
61.
As o f June 30, 2006, IFC had invested $2.9 billion o f its own funds in 135 projects in the country
across a variety o f sectors. Russia i s the single largest exposure (almost US$ 2.0 billion) in IFC’s global
portfolio. Over the previous CAS period the volume of IFC’s commitments increased dramatically. If in
FY02, IFC invested $187 million in Russia, in FY05 this figure reached $832 million. In FY06, IFC
committed $591 million and expects levels to remain at about $700 million for FY07 to FY09. A growing
part o f these investments i s in Russian owned companies - a strong vote o f confidence in Russia’s private
sector and a signal to other investors. In addition to extensive commitments to the financial sector, IFC
has been increasing i t s investments in the real sector, and has become a leading investor in Russia’s
private transport infrastructure. In the financial sector. IFC has promoted mortgage finance and
introduced ruble-linked loans. The portfolio i s very strong with no non-performing loans and higher than
forecasted returns on equity.
62.
CAS.

Fiduciary framework. The fiduciary framework s t i l l faces the issues that were described in the
One o f the main weaknesses identified by the Country Procurement Assessment for Russia

Annex C
Page 15 of 17
(CPAR-2000) was the vast and uncoordinated procurement legislation, which comprised over hundred
legislations and regulations. Moreover, voids and conflicts in the legal and regulatory environment
abounded. A new public procurement law was signed b y the President o f the Russian Federation in July
1, 2005 and will enter into force from January 1, 2006. The law covers public procurement o f goods,
works and services at the federal, regional and the municipal levels. The ongoing CPAR Update w i l l
assess possibilities o f more reliance on national competitive bidding procedures and the need for further
improvement of country procurement system and procurement practices related to Bank’s portfolio in
Russia.

63.
The latest Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA - 2001) concluded that the
public financial accountability framework in Russia i s s t i l l weak and requires substantial strengthening.
The country’s control framework i s in place, but the checks and balances do not ensure a sufficiently
controlled environment for public spending. To mitigate fiduciary risks, the C F A A recommended
continuation of project ring-fencing. At the same time, i t recognized that if public financial
accountability i s reformed, these arrangements might be revised.
64.
Country Dialogue and Aid Coordination. The Country Office played a lead role in the dialogue
with the Government on key policy issues and in resolving day-to-day implementation issues. During the
CAS period, a number o f functions were fully decentralized to the Moscow office, including
procurement, disbursement and financial management. Additionally, the decentralization o f selected
sector staff aided the policy dialogue. The office has been restructured to bring closer together
operational and core services staff in an overall leaner structure. A functional review o f the Moscow
office noted, however, that the Bank lags behind other donor agencies in terms o f the delegation o f
authority to the country office. IFC also increased its presence in Moscow by moving all business
development capacity to the field and increasing significantly i t s field-based processing and portfolio
capacity.

65.
To improve coordination between the Russian Government and the Bank, a Joint Working Group
(JWG) was established in the summer o f 2002, effectively replacing the previous semiannual country
portfolio performance review (CPPR) process. The JWG meets quarterly and comprises representatives
o f the Country Management Unit and key Government stakeholders. I t has already proved i t s usefulness
for resolution o f portfolio-wide, and project-specific issues.
66.
In implementing the CAS, the Bank Group worked extensively with external partners. The Bank
developed collaborative programs with bilateral donors, including DFID (civil service reform and poverty
analysis), CIDA (health and other programs, business development in the Russian Far East), Finland
(programs in northwest Russia, including for development o f the forestry, leasing and I C T sectors),
Switzerlandseco (corporate governance and housing finance), the Dutch Ministry o f Foreign Affairs
(corporate governance and housing finance), UN (various programs) and U S A I D (Southern Okrug).
Cooperation with Russian think tanks was extensive and a key part o f the Bank’s outreach efforts. The
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has an active program, focused on nonsovereign lending, including to Russia’s regions. The Bank and the EBRD collaborate on selected
analytical work, such as the business climate. IFC and EBRD and have co-invested in several projects.

V. LESSONS
67.
Russia presents a series o f challenges to the Bank that go beyond the Middle Income Country
framework. A number o f lessons emerge from the implementation o f the previous CAS, with
implications for design and implementation o f the new strategy:
0

in view o f Russia’s large fiscal surplus the Bank’s value added i s not in providing financial
support but in helping Russia gain access to global knowledge and s k i l l s through analytical and
advisory support and through bringing together different stakeholders and parts o f government in
forging consensus on key policy issues.

Annex C
Page 16 of 17
given Russia’s rapidly changing environment the Bank should continue to move towards a
partnership approach with a strong demand-orientation in design and delivery o f assistance and
flexibility in adjusting the Bank’s program and modalities o f assistance to client needs, making
full use o f the Bank’s flexible arrangements for well performing MICs and spearheading new
instruments of assistance drawing on increased collaboration with IFC and MIGA.
with the growing gap between prosperous and lagging regions the imminent challenge for the
Bank i s to address the development challenges at the sub-national and regional levels. Addressing
these will require the ability to (i)organize and deliver technical assistance to the 165 cities with
a population over 100,000 million (where most o f the urban poor live) and the tens of thousands
of rural municipalities ( where the extreme poor live); and (ii)provide financing, without a
sovereign guarantee, to some of these sub-national entities
given Russia’s enormous size, measures to increase the Bank’s impact - dissemination, outreach,
scaling up, project design and management - must be explicit in the Bank’s strategy. The
dissemination o f the Bank’s flagship publications (WDR, GDF, GEP, WDI) ECA Regional
Studies, the Country Economic Memorandum, Poverty Assessment and the Russia Economic
Report placed the Bank squarely in the public discourse on economic policy. I t also reinforced the
notion of the Bank as an impartial voice in Russia. WBI helped establish a presence for the Bank
in Russia’s eighty-eight regions. T h i s i s now paying o f f as the Bank seeks to work directly with
Regions.
decentralization has improved both the quality and timeliness o f the Bank’s work in Russia and
should be sustained in future operations - particularly as our work in the Russian regions
intensifies.
recent progress in speeding up portfolio implementation has been encouraging, but both the Bank
and the Russian authorities w i l l need to be diligent in staying the course given Russia’s difficult
operating environment (bureaucracy, slow decision making).
Russia i s a high cost country in which to operate. T h i s reflects numerous factors. Russia’s size
(11 time zones) adds significantly to the cost structure. At the same time, policy discussions in
Russia require very significant efforts at consensus building. Also adding to the cost o f doing
business, the machinery o f government moves very slowly, with projects requiring multiple
reviews (even after project appraisal), and implementation decisions often being delayed. I t
should be noted, however, while implementation periods are long,(some reasons o f these delays
are being addressed under the Joint Working Group), Government counterparts often prefer longterm engagement with the Bank teams on projects to prolong the use o f Bank project and
technical expertise.

VI. CONCLUSION
68.
Preparation o f the new strategy i s taking place in a fundamentally different environment than that
of four years ago. Russia’s strong fiscal position and access to financial markets limit the need for
sovereign borrowing. But the country s t i l l faces major structural tasks on many fronts. Some tasks, like
housing and communal reform, are related to the unfinished agenda o f economic transition. Others, like
public-private partnerships, seek new ways of promoting economic diversification and growth. Progress
in transformation across a vast country i s understandably uneven, and attention must be focused on the
growing gap between prosperous and lagging regions. Capacity and financial constraints slow down the
local implementation o f well-designed reforms. Tackling these constrains on a large scale requires the
mobilization o f significant domestic and international resources.

Page 17 o f 17

69.
Russia i s interested in defining a partnership with the World Bank that would respond to the
country’s strengths and remaining development challenges. The Government remains committed to
collaborate with the Bank as a source of development knowledge and project implementation capacity.
A t the same time, the Russian authorities express strong preference for a more flexible arrangement that
would allow them to tap Bank skills through a wide menu o f instruments and services. In terms of
operational modalities, discussions with the Government indicate strong interest in more flexible access to
a broad menu o f Bank instruments (AAA, technical assistance, lending, and guarantees). For the Bank
Group this would mean closer cooperation between IBRD, IFC and MIGA, more resources and
mechanism to work directly at the sub national level and exploring the possibility o f providing services
such as asset management, similar to that provided for other countries.

Lessons Learned

Prevalence o f
poverty in Russia
about 24%. Most
poor live in urban
areas; extreme poor
in rural areas. Gini
coefficient about 0.4.

Poverty headcount was
below 17% in 2005.
Most improvement in
urban areas, reflecting
the shallowness of
poverty. Gini
coefficient 0.37.

Given shallowness o f poverty
and urban predominance, the
export oriented growth was
pro-poor.

Achieve
economic
modernization
and
improvement
in enterprise
efficiency

Russia was
recovering from the
effects o f the 1998
crisis and some
improvement was
noted, e.g. the share
of loss making
enterprises fell from
55.2% in 1998 to
38.4% in
200 1.However,
economy dominated
b y large raw material
exporters. SME
employment about
25% of total

Though Russia i s s t i l l
primarily a raw
material exporter,
economic growth of the
past five years has
fueled domestic
demand and helped
diversify the economy.

Diversification and
improvements in enterprise
efficiency have occurred, but
economic modernization i s
s t i l l elusive. Poor
infrastructure and weak
linkages between universities,
research institutions and
industries most frequently
noted.

Improve fiscal
efficiency

Fiscal surplus of 3%.
Poorly targeted
federal programs
still prevalent

Fiscal surplus o f about
9% in 2005.
Stabilization Fund
established.
Performance based
budgeting underway.
Some improvement in
federally targeted
programs.

Stabilization Fund a major
step forward but major
pressure now on spending
these funds and, in general,
on relaxing fiscal discipline.
Developing performance
based budgeting and
improving federally targeted
programs s t i l l medium term
goals.

Reduce
regional
differentiation
in social and
economic
development

Significant regional
differences;
incidence o f poverty
about four times
higher in Tuva than
in Tyumen oblasts,

N o significant change.
Addressing
differentiation now a
Government priority.
Local self government
reforms to be launched
in 2006.

Unclear prospects for success
o f Government’s regional
policies. Improvements in
fiscal federal framework have
improved economic
management, but political
forces -both regional and
federal - may undermine this.

Improve the

Viewed as key
Government priority
to ensure
sustainability o f
nascent recovery in
2001 from the 1998
crisis.

Deregulation package,
Agricultural land sales
permitted. Urban

legislation. Railway
restructuring. Some
steps taken on power
sector restructuring.
Housing and communal
services reform
initiated and underway.
Banking sector reform
partially implemented.

The business environment has
improved (in spite o f the
concerns over the Yukos
affair) and competition has
increased. Though the
economy i s more diversified,
the benefits of the
Government’s “debureaucratization, financial
sector reform, and structural
reforms (e.g. railways) will be
observed over a longer time
frame than the CAS.

Strengthen
public sector
management

Public sector
management was
viewed as
incompatible with a
modem, market
economy. Federalregional financial
relations in disarray.

Ambitious federal
administrative and civil
service reform
implemented, and now
moving to local level.
Improvements in tax,
treasury, customs,
cadastre services
underway. Significant
improvements in fiscal
federal framework;
oblast not returning to
local bond market.

Improvements in public
sector (federal, regional and
sub-regional) are notable but
sheer size and scope o f the
reform means argues for
taking a long term view.

Mitigate social
and
environmental
risks.

Significant health
and demographic
challenges. Evidence
of falling
enrollments and
declining quality in
education. Large,
poorly targeted
social safety
network. Legacy o f
USSR environmental
neglect.

Greater awareness o f
demographic issues
(including migration).
Key education reforms
in curriculum and
university entrance
exams. Tentative steps
at addressing
TB/AIDS, and adult
health. Monetization of
social benefits
introduced but subject
to resistance. Some
steps on environmental
issues, e.g. nuclear
waste, Kyoto
ratification,
hydrometeorological
service, but still largely
neglected.

Deep cultural issues must be
addressed in parallel with
social sector reforms. Need
for much greater consensus
building on the costs o f the
environmental legacy and the
policy options for dealing
with it.

from crisis
management to
sustained economic
growth.

More AAA, systematic
outreach, assistance on
poverty monitoring; lending
products, including
guarantees, greater

High quality, timely,
unbiased advice, and
multi pronged efforts to
work with multiple

building an effective
relationship with the
Russian federation

Lending

Transition from
budget support.

Base case. Ten loans
approved for $1.2 billion,
compared to CAS projection
o f 17 loans for $1.8 billion.
Shortfall due to emergence
of strong federal surplus.

With expectations for
continuing surplus
future Bank lending w i l l
need to focus on nonsovereign loans, and key
reform areas where
Bank design and
implementation s l u l l s
can help Russia scale up
reform efforts.

Portfolio

Weak performance
indicators: age,
disbursement,
multiple
extensions, below
average outcomes
(about 50%
satisfactory since
1992)

Still generally weak
indicators though some
improvement. Older projects
have been closed, disconnect
significantly reduced, some
improvement in outcomes
(about 60% since 1992).

Portfolio management
requires significant time
and management
attention. Greater
decentralization of task
management to the
country office facilitates
communication with
Government and aids
implementation.
