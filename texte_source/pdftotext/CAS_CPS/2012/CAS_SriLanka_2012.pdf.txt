2. Executive Summary
i.
This review examines implementation of the FY09-12 Sri Lanka Country Partnership Strategy
(CAS) and the FY11 CAS Progress Report (CASPR), and evaluates the CAS Completion Report
(CASCR). The review covers the joint program of IDA and IFC.
ii.
WBG’s CAS was prepared before the end of the war, in May 2008, and the CASPR in June
2011, two years after the end of the conflict. The WBG strategy was organized around three pillars: (i)
expanding economic opportunities in lagging regions; (ii) improving the investment climate and
competitiveness; and (iii) enhancing the quality of services and accountability. Pillar 1, on expanding
opportunities, focused on supporting integrated rural development, and improving economic
opportunities in the Sri Lankan North and East, the conflict affected areas. Pillar 2, on the investment
climate and competitiveness, aimed at improving infrastructure provision, the business environment,
and the strategic relevance and transparency of public spending. Pillar 3 supported improving quality,
relevance and governance of education, improving health and social protection services, and
strengthening environmental protection.
iii.
IEG rates the overall outcome of the WBG strategy in Sri Lanka as moderately satisfactory.
Sri Lanka resettled about half of those displaced by the 30-year war, and rehabilitated homes as well
as the village infrastructure of part of the affected areas. The country also improved its rural
electrification both in terms of coverage and the quality of the service provided, while increasing the
capacity to generate electricity from renewable sources. The country’s progress in providing potable
water to rural areas was positive, albeit slower than in electricity. Sri Lanka made progress in
improving infrastructure provision, as well as in strengthening the business environment, including by
moving towards e-government. Sri Lanka also made progress in education and health, including in
the administration of the systems. However, the few available indicators on environmental protection
show a mixed picture, and progress in improving irrigation was slow and negligible in dams. While
budget transparency improved, the strategic relevance and efficiency of public spending did not
improve as expected. The WBG provided support for many of these achievements. Nevertheless, the
main factors behind the strengthening of the business environment were the end of the conflict and
the stable macroeconomic environment, both of which were not addressed by the WBG strategy. IEG
does not consider as outcomes of the WBG strategy those outcomes that are achieved by the country
without a contribution of the WBG. The WBG’s dialogue with Sri Lanka in the water sector and the
conservation of ecosystems was ineffective. Challenges remain in the finances of the social protection
system, the regulatory framework for environmental management in the power sector, and the
conservation of ecosystems.
iv.
IEG concurs with the lessons drawn by the CASCR, especially with the need for flexibility in a
fast-changing environment. In addition, the main lesson that IEG sees stemming from this review is
that committing to deliver results in areas where the government has articulated a different agenda
risks opting for policy advice and approaches that the government will eventually discard. In this vein,
a close dialogue on the development and implementation of the strategy, including the AAA, would

bolster the effectiveness of the WBG’s dialogue with the authorities. In addition, the CASPR is the
instrument to adjust the strategy to changing circumstances and priorities. Timely use of this
instrument enhances the relevance of the WBG’s support. Furthermore, deficient monitoring of the
strategy hinders its effectiveness by frustrating the M&E that is necessary to adjust the strategy to its
observed effectiveness, as well as the evolving priorities and country circumstances.

3. CASCR Summary
Overview of CAS Relevance:
Country Context
1.
Sri Lanka’s thirty-year civil war ended in May 2009, following the defeat of the Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam. Reflecting to some extent the return to peace as well as a sound policy framework, the
economy recovered from a temporary slowdown in 2009 to an estimated 8 percent growth in 2011. The
sectors that performed the best were the agriculture, tourism, and service sectors. Excluding the
conflict-affected North and East (for which there is no comparable data), the poverty headcount ratio
fell from 15¼ percent in 2008 to less than 9 percent in 2011. The strong economic performance also
helped Sri Lanka transition from an IDA-only status to middle-income status, leading to a change to
IDA-IBRD blend borrower in FY12. Sri Lanka’s sovereign debt remains below investment grade, by
four notches according to Standard and Poor’s (B+) and by three notches according to Fitch (BB-) and
Moody’s (B1). Its proneness to natural hazards was underscored in late 2010 when heavy rains
resulted in floods and landslides that affected more than five percent of a population of 21 million.
Despite its strong economic performance and poverty reduction, Sri Lanka faces a challenging agenda
of developing and reconstructing infrastructure, rehabilitating conflict-afflicted areas of the North and
East, and resettling people displaced by the conflict.
2.
Sri Lanka’s priorities—expressed in the government’s 10-year Development Framework,
Mahinda Chintana— were issued in 2005 (“Towards a New Sri Lanka”) and revised after the end of the
internal conflict in 2010 (“Vision for the Future”). The first strategy aimed at accelerating growth through
increased investment in infrastructure, achieving more equitable development through accelerated
rural development, and strengthening public service delivery, particularly in health and education. The
post-conflict strategy retained the main direction, and emphasized the urban and middle-income
country agendas.
Objectives of WBG Strategy
3.
The WBG’s CAS was prepared before the end of the war, in May 2008, and the CASPR in
June 2011, two years after the end of the conflict. The WBG strategy was organized around three
pillars: (i) expanding economic opportunities in lagging regions; (ii) improving the investment climate
and competitiveness; and (iii) enhancing the quality of services and accountability. Pillar 1, on
expanding opportunities, focused on supporting integrated rural development, and improving economic
opportunities in the Sri Lankan North and East, the conflict affected areas. Pillar 2, on the investment
climate and competitiveness, aimed at improving infrastructure provision, the business environment,
and the strategic relevance and transparency of public spending. Pillar 3 supported improving quality,
relevance and governance of education, improving health and social protection services, and
strengthening environmental protection.
Relevance of the WBG Strategy
4.
The WBG strategy addressed key challenges facing Sri Lanka, particularly on growth and
social services, as well as the end of the internal conflict in Sri Lanka in 2009. The strategy was

CASCR Review

broadly aligned with the government’s both Mahinda Chintana, but the approach to achieve the
objectives differed in some cases. The WBG’s response to changing circumstances and events, such
as peace and the rains, was flexible on size and timing of key operations. At the CASPR stage—which
came rather late—the WBG broadened the scope of involvement to urban development, social
security, and growth. The CAS put in place a “conflict filter” to ensure that projects addressed the
causes and consequences of the conflict, and gave a balanced perception of WBG reach towards both
sides of the internal conflict. IEG notes that the AAA associated with the how-to guidance was
delivered in FY12.
5.
The WBG’s analytic and advisory activities (AAA) were not fully aligned with the government’s
priorities, thus hindering the WBG’s dialogue with the government. The authorities perceived that the
focus of the WBG agenda on IDA priorities—social development and poverty reduction—was not in
line with the shift of Sri Lanka to middle-income status. The authorities also perceived that WBG did
not design solutions tailored to the country’s problems (e.g. agriculture). In environment, although the
authorities judged that the AAA was relevant, its impact was muted because of divergent views on the
content of the AAA. The timing of the CASPR compounded this predicament, because it was prepared
towards the end of FY11 and, thus, not able to respond to the evolving government priorities on a
timely basis. The original strategy also committed to deliver results in areas where the government had
not articulated a precise agenda or where the government opted for other policy options (e.g.
ecosystems conservation).
6.
IFC interventions responded to some of the country conditions. Under the previous CAS, the
main areas of involvement were electric power generation, commercial bank support, and agribusiness development advice. IFC expanded the scope of involvement at the time of the CASPR, also
focusing on small-business capacity building in five Southern regions, including on how to establish
better linkages across the country—these five regions were not the conflict affected ones. IFC invested
in and provided advice to companies in the information and communication technology sector.
Risk Identification and Mitigation
7.
The CAS indicated that the main risks to IDA’s effectiveness were: (a) a significant escalation
of the conflict; (b) a serious macroeconomic crisis; (c) fiduciary risks; and (d) reputational risks from
being perceived as biased against one side in the inter-ethnic conflict. In the event, the first two risks
did not materialize. IEG has no information on developments under the other two.
Overview of CAS Implementation:
Lending and Investments
8.
IDA lending amounted to about US$1 billion over the CAS period with about a third going to
exclusively to conflict afflicted areas and the remainder including other areas as well. Of fourteen projects
active at the outset of the CAS in FY09, three focused on conflict affected areas, and this number
increased to seven out of twenty projects active at the end of the CAS. Of the21 proposed lending
activities six were dropped; at the same time, four Additional Financing operations were approved,
covering road projects and recovery from infrastructural damage caused by the 2010 rains on conflictafflicted areas.
9.
Ten IFC investment projects were in operation at inception of the review period, for
US$220 million of net commitments. Of these, seven projects were in finance and insurance, and one
health, one in telecommunications and another in tourism services. IFC undertook seven additional
projects amounting to net commitments of US$173million. These covered finance and insurance,
health care, electric power, and a private equity fund.

10.
While the outcome of IDA projects exiting the portfolio in the period was strong, portfolio
performance weakened during the CAS period. Of three projects that exited during the period and
evaluated by IEG, all were rated as moderately satisfactory or better, albeit with risks to the
development outcomes on the high side. As for portfolio management, the proportion of commitments
at risk increased throughout the CAS period and represented about 36 percent in FY12, higher than
the average for the South Asia Region (16 percent) and IBRD/IDA (14 percent). The increase in
portfolio risk may reflect the shift toward projects in the conflict affected area.
11.
IFC’s portfolio approved during the CAS period is relatively new, and there are no IEG
evaluations for the new projects yet. IEG evaluations of pre-existing IFC operations gave them positive
ratings, with the exception of one focused on housing finance and another one on telecommunications.
The latter’s unsatisfactory financial results were tempered by a positive assessment of social and
environmental effects and private-sector development impact.
Advisory and Analytical Activities and Services
12.
IBRD-IDA delivered 29 pieces of analytical and advisory activities (AAA), of which twelve were
planned. Seventeen planned AAA products were dropped. The areas covered by AAA included an
Infrastructure Assessment, a report on Growth Potential in Lagging Regions, a Demographic Transition
Study, as well education, health, disaster reduction and recovery, development partner coordination,
tourism, gender, urban policy, transport, agricultural policy, and competitive skills. Although the
changing AAA agenda partly reflected government preferences, AAA was not fully aligned with the
transformation agenda of the government as mentioned above.
13.
IFC approved five advisory projects on access to finance amounting to US$2.2 million. IEG
rated two of these projects positively.
Partnerships and Development Partner Cooperation
14.
IDA cooperated well with other development partners and played a coordinating role during the
CAS period. Key external partners were the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Japan and a host of UN
agencies. Within WBG, cooperation was good between IDA and IFC.
Safeguards and Fiduciary Issues
15.
There were no significant safeguards issues or fiduciary complaints that IEG is aware of in the
WBG portfolio.
Overview of CAS Implementation:
Pillar 1: Expanding Economic Opportunities
16.
Under this pillar the WBG’s support was to focus on (i) supporting integrated rural
development; and (ii) improving economic opportunities in the North and East.
17.
Supporting integrated rural development. The WBG’s efforts concentrated on developing
rural access to electricity, improving availability of drinking water, and improving irrigation systems.
These were additional to an ongoing effort to address the risks of dams. As for electricity, the share of
rural households having the electricity as a source of lighting increased from 78.5 percent in 2007 to
83.2 percent in 2010. In addition, the World Economic Forum (WEF) indicator on the quality of
electricity supply improved from 4.6 over 7.0 in 2009-10 to 5.0 in 2010-11. Sri Lanka, with WBG
support, increased the capacity to generate electricity from renewable sources from about 110 MW in
2008 to 174.2 MW in November 2011, and supplied more households and entities with off-grid

CASCR Review

electricity. In regard to drinking water, the percentage of households with access to water in rural areas
increased from 71.0 percent in 2008 to 73.8 percent in 2010. As for improving irrigation, Sri Lanka has
made slow progress in repairing its large and dated irrigation system, as step deemed essential to
improve flood management and raise agricultural productivity. In addition, only two out of thirty two
large dams are considered as not risky for the population as of the end of 2011. Heavy rains during
2010 slowed progress in irrigation and dams.
18.
Sri Lanka received support from Japan and China in power, and ADB and Japan in water
supply. Within the WBG, both IDA and IFC had interventions aimed at supporting this sub-objective.
IDA had the Renewable Energy for Rural Economic Development Project (FY02), which closed in
FY12, the Second Community Development and Livelihood Improvement Project (FY10), and the Dam
Safety and Water Resources Planning (FY08). While the first one is reported as satisfactory, the
second one has been restructured and is deemed to have unrealistic goals; the third one is behind
schedule. Several projects planned in the water sector were not being delivered because of authorities’
different priorities for the sector. IFC established a risk-sharing facility with two commercial banks
that—together with advisory services—supported small hydro and wind power projects (65.4 MW),
and provided direct financing for wind power generation.
19.
Improving economic opportunities in the North and East. Under this objective the WBG
intended to support resettlement of those displaced by the conflict, housing and village rehabilitation
and construction, and improving access to public services and infrastructure for the rural conflictaffected areas. As of end-October 2011 over 187 thousand refugees had returned to their homes, out
of about 395 thousand displaced, as estimated by UNHCR in August 2011. Moreover, those resettled
have come back to more employment opportunities, fueled in part by the reconstruction efforts and the
rehabilitation of farming. With involvement of communities and final beneficiaries, Sri Lanka has
reconstructed some 52 thousand homes and has rebuilt basic infrastructure in several hundreds of
villages. Also, the share of rural population with access to basic infrastructure facilities in the North and
East increased from 9 percent in 2008 to 15 percent in 2011.
20.
As with the previous one, both IDA and IFC provided support to Sri Lanka for this subobjective. IDA interventions included the Emergency Northern Recovery Project (ENRP, FY10), the
Puttalam Housing Project (PHP, FY07), the Northeast Housing Reconstruction Project (NHRP, FY05)
and its additional financing (FY09), and the Second North East Irrigated Agriculture Project (FY04),
which was restructured in 2007 and renamed Community Livelihoods in Conflict Affected areas (locally
known as the Re-awakening Project) and which received two additional financings (in 2009, to support
resettlement and scale-up support for village development and irrigation, and in 2011, to provide
emergency response to the rains and flooding in late-2010 and early-2011). Of these interventions, the
PHP and the NHRP closed in FY12. IFC provided advisory services to help formulate strategies to
finance SMEs in the conflict areas.
21.
IEG rates the outcome of the WBG strategy in Pillar 1 as moderately satisfactory. Sri Lanka
improved its rural electrification both in terms of coverage and the quality of the service provided, while
increasing the capacity to generate electricity from renewable sources. The country’s progress in
providing potable water to rural areas was positive, albeit slower than in electricity. Sri Lanka also
resettled about half of those displaced by the 30-year war, and rehabilitated homes as well as the
village infrastructure of part of the affected areas. However, Sri Lanka’s progress in improving irrigation
was slow and negligible in dams. The WBG provided support for these achievements, with the
exception of those in the water sector where the WBG’s views differed from the country’s own
priorities.

Pillar 2: Improving the Investment Climate and Competitiveness
22.
Under this pillar the WBG’s support to Sri Lanka was to focus on improving (i) infrastructure
provision; (ii) the business environment for stronger entrepreneurship and a knowledge-based
economy; and (iii) the strategic relevance and transparency of public spending.
23.
Improving infrastructure provision. The WBG’s strategy in this objective focused on roads.
The WEF indicator quality of overall infrastructure increased from 3.8 over 7.0 in 2008-09 to 4.7 in
2011-12, while that for the quality of roads increased from 3.6 to 4.5 in the same period. Moreover, the
1
International Road Roughness Index declined from 7.0 m/km in 2007 to 6.2 m/km in 2010 , and the
average network vehicle operating cost estimated by the World Bank almost halved from 23.8
Rupees/km in 2005 to 14.6 Rupees/km in 2010. Sri Lanka also reduced the share of the road network
in poor or bad condition from 52 percent in 2005 to 38 percent in 2010. The government appropriated
additional resources to the Road Maintenance Fund in 2010.
24.
Main IDA interventions to support this objective were a loan for the Road Sector Assistance
project (RSAP, FY06) and its two additional financings (FY09 and FY11), the Provincial Roads Project
(PRP, FY10), and the Metro Colombo Urban Development project (MCUDP, FY12). There was only
one piece of AAA delivered (in FY12).
25.
Development partners supporting the roads sector worked through the Transport Forum, which
was established by the three main development partners in the sector: ADB, Japan, and IDA. ADB
took the lead in supporting the development of the Road Master Plan. Japan took the lead supporting
the development of a competitive and competent road construction sector. IDA focused on
strengthening the institutional framework for road maintenance through the establishment of the Road
Maintenance Fund. IFC invested in a telecommunication company, and in a port. Its work to promote
public-private partnerships (PPPs) in infrastructure development has yet to pay off because the
government does not want WBG support in this area. China and ADB provided support on ports.
26.
Improving the business environment for stronger entrepreneurship and a knowledgebased economy. The end of the conflict changed significantly the environment for business in Sri
Lanka. The country’s Global Competitiveness Index (WEF) rating increased from 4.0 over 7.0 in 2008
to 4.3 in 2011. The macroeconomic environment was the component that most improved (from 3.1 to
4.1), followed by infrastructure (from 3.6 to 4.1), and health and primary education (from 5.7 to 6.0).
The WEF also reports that the share of the population using internet increased from 5.9 percent in
2008 to 12.0 in 2010. Tourism arrivals increased significantly following the end of the conflict—50
percent in 2010 alone, with 655,000 visits.
27.
IDA supported Sri Lanka through the E-Lanka Development project (ELDP, FY05) and its
additional financing (FY12), the Sustainable Tourism Development project (STDP, FY10), and the
Small and Medium Enterprise Development facility (SMED, FY11). There were also three pieces of
AAA. IFC is giving advice for the establishment of the Secured Collateral Registry, and provided
performance-based grants for micro-loans in conflict (North and East) and non-conflict (South) regions.
In addition, IFC provided advisory services on SMEs, including financing, and on tourism.
28.
Improving the strategic relevance and transparency of public spending. The limited
engagement of IDA in this area has not produced results yet. The WEF rating of wastefulness of
government spending improved from 3.3 out of 7.0 in 2008-09 to 3.8 in 2011-12. Government
effectiveness as measured by the World Governance Indicators, declined between 2008 and 2010,
although the Open Budget Index shows some improvement in the transparency of the government

budget with its score increasing from 64 over 100 in 2008 to 67 in 2010. The public audit coverage
extended from 50 percent of the public sector organizations in 2008 to 100 percent in May 2011.
29.
IDA provided financial support to Sri Lanka in this area through the Public Sector Capacity
Building project (FY08), and an IDF Grant to support the Committees of Public Accounts and Public
Enterprises (FY12). The Public Sector Capacity Building project (FY08) helped increase the coverage
of public audit to all public sector organizations. IDA also delivered two pieces of AAA, both on
procurement.
30.
IEG rates the outcome of the WBG strategy in Pillar 2 as moderately unsatisfactory. Sri Lanka
made progress in improving roads, as well as in strengthening the business environment, including by
moving towards e-government. While budget transparency improved, the strategic relevance and
efficiency did not improve as expected. WBG support was limited in roads, and ineffective in improving
the strategic relevance and transparency of public spending. Moreover, the main factors behind the
strengthening of the business environment and increased tourism were the end of the conflict and the
stable macroeconomic environment, both of which were not addressed by the WBG strategy. IEG does
not consider as satisfactory outcomes of the WBG strategy those outcomes that are achieved by the
country without a contribution of the WBG.
Pillar 3: Enhancing the quality of services and accountability
31.
Under this pillar the WBG’s strategy supported Sri Lanka’s efforts at (i) improving the quality,
relevance, and governance of education; (ii) improving health and social protection services; and (iii)
strengthening environmental protection.
32.
Improving the quality, relevance, and governance of education. Sri Lanka improved the
quality of education somewhat; and launched institutional reform in higher education. School survival
rates through grade 9 increased from 78 percent in 2005 to 91 percent in 2011, while the proportion of
primary school students attaining competence in mathematics increased from 69 percent to 82 percent
during the same period. At the tertiary level, the information technology achievement scores for
undergraduates rose from 49 percent in 2008 to 56 percent at end-2010—the latest available
information. Broader measures of education outcomes (WEF) show an increase in the rating of the
quality of the education system from 4.1 over 7.0 in 2008-09 to 4.3 in 2011-12, and in the rating of
higher education and training from 4.0 to 4.2 in the same period. However, WEF indicators also show a
decline in the rating of education in mathematics and science from 4.7 to 4.2 over the same period. Sri
Lanka’s general improvement in these education indicators reflects better governance for the sector. A
school-based management approach was extended from 16 zones (17 percent) to all zones of the
country during the CAS, with all zones adopting attendance committees and teacher training programs.
33.
WBG provided support to Sri Lanka, working with provincial and local governments, through
the Education Sector Development project (FY06, a SWAp) which closed in FY11, the Improving
Relevance and Quality of Undergraduate Education project (FY03) which closed in FY10, and a Higher
Education for the Twenty First Century project (FY10). This was complemented by two pieces of AAA.
34.
Improving health and social protection services. Sri Lanka made progress in health as
reflected in lower infant mortality, which declined from 15.1 per 1,000 births in 2008 to 14.2 in 2010.
Similarly, DPT immunization for children ages 12-23 months increased from 98 percent in 2008 to 99
percent in 2010. Broader measures on health and primary education from WEF show a significant
improvement from a rating 5.7 in 2008-09 to 6.0 in 2011-12. Improvements in health partly reflect a
greater focus on performance and results in the health system; all health districts are now reporting
regularly on performance compared with less than 30 percent in 2006. Despite this progress, the
finances of the social protection system remain to be strengthened.

CASCR Review
Independent Evaluation Group

35.
IDA’s contribution to Sri Lanka came through the Health Sector Development project (FY04, a
sector wide approach, SWAp) which closed in FY11. This was complemented by three pieces of AAA
and an IDF grant to support the targeting of social assistance.). IFC invested in a hospital in Colombo
during the CAS.
36.
Strengthening environmental protection. There is little information available on progress in
environmental protection in Sri Lanka, and the few data available show a mixed picture. The higher
production of renewable energy mentioned above couples with a slight increase in the production of
charcoal and bagasse from 185.8 thousand tons in 2008 to 187.7 thousand in 2010. The forest area
declined from 29.9 percent of the country’s land in 2005 to 29.0 percent in 2010, a small amount
considering the conflict. The CASCR acknowledges that there was no progress on the preservation of
the biodiversity of the country, and that the regulatory framework for environmental management in the
power sector backed by IDA is yet to be implemented.
37.
IDA’s contribution came through the Renewable Energy for Rural Economic Development
project (REREDP, FY02) which closed in FY12. This was complemented by AAA on Environmental
Issues in the Power Sector—Consequences of Coal Based Generation (FY10). A project on
ecosystems conservation was cancelled because the government and IDA could not agree on the
terms. IFC trained small-and-medium hotel operators’ energy-efficient practices that allowed them to
obtain the OS Green Building Council’s Certification. There is no data on how many operators earned
the certification.
38.
IEG rates the outcome of the WBG strategy in Pillar 3 as moderately satisfactory. Sri Lanka
made progress in education and health, including in the administration of the systems. The few
available indicators on environmental protection show a mixed picture. Challenges remain in the
finances of the social protection system, the regulatory framework for environmental management in
the power sector, and the conservation of ecosystems.

IEG rates the overall outcome of the WBG strategy in Sri Lanka as moderately satisfactory.
Sri Lanka resettled about half of those displaced by the 30-year war, and rehabilitated homes as well
as the village infrastructure of part of the affected areas. The country also improved its rural
electrification both in terms of coverage and the quality of the service provided, while increasing the
capacity to generate electricity from renewable sources. The country’s progress in providing potable
water to rural areas was positive, albeit slower than in electricity. Sri Lanka made progress in improving
infrastructure provision, as well as in strengthening the business environment, including by moving
towards e-government. Sri Lanka also made progress in education and health, including in the
administration of the systems. However, the few available indicators on environmental protection show

CASCR Review

a mixed picture, and progress in improving irrigation was slow and negligible in dams. While budget
transparency improved, the strategic relevance and efficiency of public spending did not improve as
expected. The WBG provided support for many of these achievements. Nevertheless, the main factors
behind the strengthening of the business environment were the end of the conflict and the stable
macroeconomic environment, both of which were not addressed by the WBG strategy. IEG does not
consider as outcomes of the WBG strategy those outcomes that are achieved by the country without a
contribution of the WBG. The WBG’s dialogue with Sri Lanka in the water sector and the conservation
of ecosystems was ineffective. Challenges remain in the finances of the social protection system, the
regulatory framework for environmental management in the power sector, and the conservation of
ecosystems.
IDA Performance:
40.
IEG rates IDA performance as moderately satisfactory. IDA reacted quickly to support Sri
Lanka at the end of the 30 year war and in facing the 2010 floods. The WBG’s strategy was aligned
with Sri Lanka’s development strategy at a very broad level, but differed on many aspects, particularly
on the water sector and the environment. The WBG’s AAA was not fully aligned with the government’s
priorities, thus hindering the WBG’s dialogue with the government. The authorities perceived that the
focus of the WBG agenda on IDA priorities—social development and poverty reduction—was
becoming misaligned with the reality of Sri Lanka growing to middle-income status. According to the
CASCR, the authorities also perceived that IDA did not design solutions tailored to the country’s
circumstances. The CASPR was prepared towards the end of the CAS period (FY11), yet it did not
reflect the evolving government priorities on a timely basis. The original CAS also committed to deliver
results in areas where the government had not articulated a precise agenda or where the government
opted for other policy options (e.g. ecosystems conservation). Coordination was good with other
development partners, especially in the transport sector. Within the WBG, the strategy was wellcoordinated between IBRD-IDA and IFC, who complemented each other well for good results,
especially in including the private sector in Sri Lanka’s broader development agenda. The results
framework included indicators that were not available and, accordingly, were not monitored or updated
at the time of the CASPR.
IFC Performance:
41.
IEG rates performance of IFC as moderately satisfactory. IFC’s relevance was weak. IFC’s
strategy was relevant for the third pillar, but lacked focus on the post-conflict recuperation of the North
and East regions as envisaged under the first pillar or the developments foreseen for the second pillar.
Recovery of the post-conflict regions would call for a more pro-active stance by IFC.

5. Assessment of CAS Completion Report

This is a well-written and candid CASCR. It is detailed and comprehensive on the activities
undertaken by the WBG but short in terms of outcomes. The CASCR could have covered better some
of the country outcomes that correspond to the strategy objectives. It could also have been more
direct and dealt more in-depth with the areas of the program that did not go well, to find out the
reasons and draw lessons, particularly regarding the disagreements in the water sectors and the
environment. The lessons drawn by the CASCR were pertinent.

6. Findings and Lessons
43.
IEG concurs with the lessons drawn by the CASCR, especially with the need for flexibility in a
fast-changing environment. In addition, the main lesson that IEG sees stemming from this review is
that committing to deliver results in areas where the government has articulated a different agenda
risks opting for policy advice and approaches that the government will eventually discard. In this vein,
a close dialogue on the development and implementation of the strategy, including the AAA, would
bolster the effectiveness of the WBG’s dialogue with the authorities. In addition, the CASPR is the
instrument to adjust the strategy to changing circumstances and priorities. Timely use of this
instrument enhances the relevance of the WBG’s support. Furthermore, deficient monitoring of the
strategy hinders its effectiveness by frustrating the M&E that is necessary to adjust the strategy to its
observed effectiveness, as well as the evolving priorities and country circumstances.
