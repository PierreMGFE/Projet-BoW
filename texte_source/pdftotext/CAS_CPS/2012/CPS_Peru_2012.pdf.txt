2. Executive Summary
i.
This review examines implementation of the FY07-11 Peru Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) and the FY09 CPS Progress Report (CPSPR), and evaluates the CPS Completion Report
(CPSCR). The review covers the joint program of IBRD, IFC and MIGA. The review complements the
Country Program Evaluation (CPE) on Peru discussed by CODE in July of 2010 (Peru: Country
Program Evaluation for the World Bank Group, 2003-09). The two reviews, however, cover different
periods (2007-11 in the CPSCR Review vs. 2003-09 in the CPE) as well as a somewhat different set
of objectives. These two aspects explain the differences in the evaluations, such as the upgrading in
rating of a pillar and the downgrading of another.
ii.
The WBG strategy was organized around three pillars: (i) accelerating economic growth;
(ii) enhancing social development; and (iii) modernizing institutions. Pillar 1, on growth, focused on
maintaining macro stability and reducing macro vulnerabilities, accelerating growth and broadening its
sources, as well as making growth environmentally sustainable. Pillar 2, on social development, aimed
at meeting basic needs, and promoting and developing a new social contract on education, health and
nutrition. Pillar 3 supported furthering decentralization and access to public services, strengthening
public sector management, and improving the justice system and reducing corruption.
iii.
IEG rates the overall outcome of the WBG strategy in Peru as moderately satisfactory. IEG
notes that Peru’s own accomplishments in many areas, particularly on growth, macroeconomic
stability, de-dollarizing the monetary system, and addressing some basic needs are remarkable—
these achievements are mostly attributable to Peru’s own efforts. IEG also highlights the timeliness of
the WBG’s support to Peru at the time of the global financial crisis, which was instrumental in helping
the country access world bond markets, as well as the additionality of IFC’s intervention in supporting
municipalities use their royalties to benefit poor communities. With WBG support, Peru has improved
public expenditure efficiency, some rural infrastructure as noted in the Peru CPE, and environmental
frameworks and regulations, as well as increased access to water, sanitation and electricity, also
highlighted in the Peru CPE. Peru made progress in strengthening public sector management and,
with support from the WBG, established a unified treasury account, and is making headway in resultsbased budgeting at the national level, participatory investment budgeting at the local level, and
mainstreaming an integrated financial administration system also at the sub-national level. Spending
of royalties by some local governments is also benefiting local communities. With mixed results, Peru
worked on improving the quality of education, the coverage of health services, and nutrition, and
continues to work on improving its justice system and abating corruption, albeit slowly and with uneven
outcomes. There is no information about progress on housing and property rights, and on how health
services have been adapted to the evolving epidemiological profile. The WBG made little progress in
helping Peru reduce informality or promote non-traditional labor intensive sectors of the Peruvian
economy, and came late in the CPS period with assistance on disaster preparedness and mitigation.
The country’s decentralization process came to a halt for political reasons early in the CPS period,
making immaterial the WBG’s objective of supporting it.

iv.
IEG underscores four lessons stemming from this review. First, the WBG has greater
development effectiveness when it aligns its strategy with the government’s own program, as
evidenced by the highly effective intervention supporting Peru’s actions to deal with the effects of the
global financial crisis. By contrast, the WBG had less effective interventions in areas with little country
buy in, such as the decentralization in social sectors and rural education. Second, the development
effectiveness of the WBG can only be demonstrated where there are interventions that can help the
country deliver the expected results. By contrast, strategy objectives that are beyond the purview of
the WBG, although achieved by the country, are not a demonstration of the WBG’s development
effectiveness. Third, WBG strategies gain efficacy when they have a monitoring and evaluation
framework that is based on available and verified data, and that can actually be used by the WBG to
actively play out its strategy. Within this review, those objectives that were better monitored were the
ones that showed the best development results. Fourth, the WBG could find ways of improving
coordination within the Group itself to take advantage of good initiatives that can be scaled up for the
benefit of the country, as could have been the case with IFC’s work with the municipalities that were
receiving the royalties of its investees.

3. CPS Summary
Overview of CAS Relevance:
Country Context
1.
A sound policy framework, prudent macroeconomic policies and strong commodity prices
helped Peru achieve cumulative GDP real growth of over 31 percent between 2007 and 2010, which led
to a fall in poverty from 46 percent in 2006 to 31 percent in 2010, the latest measure. The strong
cumulative growth includes a decline in the rate of growth to about 1 percent in 2009 due to the global
financial crisis, as well as a rebound of 9 percent in 2010. Notwithstanding the crisis and in its midst, the
international rating agencies granted Peru investment grade-- Fitch (2008), Standard and Poor’s (2008),
and Moody’s (2009), which the country still maintains. Peru also had to face two major earthquakes,
one in 2007 (magnitude 8.0, Richter scale) and another one in 2011 (magnitude 6.9), as well as the
impact of ―El Niño‖ (and the subsequent ―La Niña‖) in 2010. Despite its strong macroeconomic and
poverty reduction performance, Peru still faces challenges, including in reducing poverty further with a
more equal distribution of income, developing infrastructure, and improving the quality of social
services.
2.
Peru’s priorities—expressed in the Prime Minister’s presentation of the government plan to the
Peruvian Congress in August of 2006—were to sustain and accelerate economic growth to ensure a
rapid reduction of poverty. Emphasis would be put on promoting economic and human development,
bolstering social inclusion, and improving living standards. The transition from President Toledo (200106) to President Garcia (2006-11) brought changes in the overall country strategy. While in some areas,
such as macroeconomic policy, the country’s own priorities remained unchanged (as is discussed in the
Peru CPE), in others, notably decentralization, there were significant changes.
Objectives of WBG Strategy
3.
The WBG strategy was organized around three pillars: (i) accelerating economic growth;
(ii) enhancing social development; and (iii) modernizing institutions. Pillar 1, on growth, focused on
maintaining macro stability and reducing macro vulnerabilities, accelerating growth and broadening its
sources, as well as making growth environmentally sustainable. Pillar 2, on social development, aimed
at meeting basic needs, and promoting and developing a new social contract on education, health and
nutrition. Pillar 3 supported furthering decentralization and access to public services, strengthening
public sector management, and improving the justice system and reducing corruption.
Relevance of the WBG Strategy
4.

The WBG strategy addressed some of the key challenges facing Peru, particularly on growth,

CPSCR Review
Independent Evaluation Group

inclusion, and social services, and responded flexibly to the evolving global financial crisis. The
strategy was aligned with Peru’s government plan, and the WBG’s response was flexible on size and
timing of key operations. At the same time, feedback from former Ministry of Finance officials suggests
that the initial reform platform developed under the CPS was short on detail, lacked agreement on
specific reform interventions expected from the WBG, and could have given the wrong impression that
Peru was going to use WBG services extensively in its implementation of policies. In the event, Peru
went its own way on reform, and the dialogue with the authorities was not as fluid as needed for the
WBG to bring into its own projects and programs the country’s changing policy intentions. As a result,
projects such as the decentralization in social sectors and rural education performed poorly.
Nevertheless, the WBG responded flexibly and diligently to the requests for assistance from the
Peruvian authorities at the time of the global financial crisis.
5.
The WBG strategy was weakly relevant in its design. Some outcomes were not supported by
appropriate WBG interventions, while there were loose links between WBG strategy objectives and its
interventions for other outcomes. Under Pillar 1 in particular, the WBG targeted high-order macro
outcomes with interventions of a fairly circumscribed scope. For example, the outcomes on informality
and tourism development under this pillar were not plausibly linked to the interventions. Some of the
macro outcomes in Pillar I (for example on inflation and de-dollarization) were outside the WBG’s
purview and capacity to influence, and there were no WBG interventions in the strategy that could have
had an impact on them. Moreover, on program design, the monitoring of the results framework was
made difficult by some indicators that were not measurable or did not have proper baselines, limiting
their use for the WBG’s monitoring and evaluation, as well as subsequent decision-making.
6.
Both IFC and MIGA interventions were congruent with market demand. IFC invested in natural
resources, electricity generation and transmission, toll roads, and improving Lima’s airport, while
supporting SMEs through its investee financial institutions—the bulk of these investments were in
Peru’s traditional sectors. MIGA participated by extending guarantees for the transportation, mining,
and financial sectors. IFC’s additionality at the country program level was particularly high in its
investment in a private natural resource company whose royalties helped strengthen the administration
of recipient poor municipalities with support from IFC. These activities were conducted in one of Peru’s
poorest regions with IFC support. The municipalities—after being strengthened—utilized the royalties
obtained to invest in local schools, roads, and other infrastructure, lifting the quality of services for the
poor.
Risk Identification and Mitigation
7.
The CPS indicated that the main risks to the program were possible social conflict, vulnerability
to external shocks, particularly a global economic downturn or natural disasters, and delays in the US
approval of the Free Trade Agreement (FTA). The social conflict and the FTA risks had mitigating
measures, but did not materialize. The strategy did not identify mitigating measures to address the
impact of the external shocks, which indeed happened—major earthquakes, ―El Niño‖ and the global
financial crisis. Outside of the original strategy framework, the WBG moved swiftly to provide support to
Peru to help it cope with the first earthquake and the global financial crisis.
Overview of CAS Implementation:
Lending and Investments
8.
IBRD lending amounted to US$2.7 billion over the CPS period—lower than the US3.5 billion
indicated in the CPS. The reduced lending responded to an explicit government decision to minimize

CPSCR Review
Independent Evaluation Group

borrowing from international financial institutions in view of the rapid growth of international reserves and
fiscal revenues. Moreover, about US$1.4 billion of the funds borrowed were in the form of deferred
drawdown options (DDOs), which were largely not exercised by Peru (only US$350 million were used by
the country). The elleven policy loans made during the CPS period—which include the DDOs—amounted
to US$2.2 billion, and fourteen projects—of which six were not programmed—amounted to about US$500
million. Nine programmed projects were dropped or postponed. The main development policy loan
operations were on fiscal management and competitiveness (a programmatic series of four), the
environment (a programmatic series of two), dealing with catastrophes, and results and accountability in
social sectors. Investment projects focused on agriculture, water and sanitation, rural development, rural
electrification, transport infrastructure, health reform, property rights, and water resources management.
9.
Thirty-two IFC investment projects, with 24 partners, were in operation at inception of the
review period, for US$309 million of net commitment. IFC had developed a sizeable investment portfolio
in the pre-CPS period in a variety of activities and most of the projects related to agriculture were closed
in the review period. During the review period, IFC committed another US$952 million for 47 projects,
with 29 partners in a variety of sectors. The largest IFC interventions were for developing Peru’s natural
resource exports: a US$ 36 million investment and US$340 million in loans for gas liquefaction and gas
and oil field development. MIGA guarantees totaling $65 million helped investments in the
transportation (US$7 million), mining (US$40 million), and financial (US$18 million) sectors.
10.
Performance of IBRD projects was adequate and the portfolio remained healthy. The proportion
of commitments at risk represented about 1 percent of the portfolio in FY11, better than the average for
the Latin America and Caribbean Region (9.9 percent). Implementation of most projects was rated
moderately satisfactory or satisfactory, with exception of the Sierra Rural Development Project and the
Vilcanota Valley Rehabilitation and Management Project which were rated moderately unsatisfactory.
Slow implementation of the latter two projects reflects delays in approving sub-components of the
projects by the central government, and inexperience of the Cusco local government in implementing
IBRD-financed projects.
11.
Except for one project with a negative evaluation, IEG has rated IFC’s investment projects
positively for development effectiveness. However, IFC’s portfolio approved during the CPS period is
relatively new, and there are no IEG evaluations for the new projects. The average riskiness of the IFC
portfolio appears to have gone up as IFC invested in equity in many projects in Peru, and ventured into
areas that are more risky financially but have significant social returns.
Advisory and Analytical Activities and Services
12.
IBRD delivered 45 analytical and advisory activities (AAA), 15 of which were not planned. The
areas covered by AAA included a Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), a Public Expenditure
Review (PER), an FSAP update, as well as topics such as informality, anti-poverty strategy in Lima,
effectiveness of anti-poverty intervention, skills and labor policies for the poor, rural electrification,
capital markets development, national gas development strategy, governance and governability,
national procurement system and strategy, decentralization in social sectors, municipal services
assessment, social and distributional impact analysis of participatory budgeting, natural resources, land
use, and the environment. In addition, there was non-lending technical assistance on poverty,
education, nutrition, health, and governance.
13.
During the CPS period, IFC continued to implement six advisory services in the pipeline.
Through one of these, National Plan Peru, IFC provided investment climate support to eight
municipalities and participated (along with USAID, CIDA, DIFID, USAID and more than 20 other
entities) in Peru’s Tramifacil program, a program to reduce red tape and increase formalization. In
addition, IFC began another 23 advisory services. Two of these were approved in FY11 but are in the
pre-implementation stage. The major themes have been linking SMEs with large entities where IFC has
invested, and strengthening municipalities in their use of natural resource based royalties to address
the needs of the communities. The four finalized IEG advisory service project evaluations found the
projects successful.

14.
The Peru CPE discussed in detail the effectiveness of the advisory and analytical activities of
the WBG until FY09, finding that their impact was generally good but varied across sectors.
Partnerships and Development Partner Cooperation
15.
Within the WBG, cooperation at the strategy stage was positive between IBRD, IFC, and MIGA,
but less so at the operational level, as noted in the Peru CPE. In some cases, such as IFC’s
engagement in capacity development in the municipalities receiving royalties, closer IBRD-IFC
engagement might have helped enhance the program and its scaling up. Beyond the WBG itself,
cooperation with the IMF, the Inter American Development Bank (IADB), the Corporacion Andina de
Fomento (CAF), the Fondo Latino Americano de Reservas (FLAR), and other external development
partners was good, and framed within a strong leadership by the government. As noted above, IFC
collaborated with CIDA, DFID, USAID and 20 other entities in one of its advisory services.
Safeguards and Fiduciary Issues
16.

There were no significant safeguards issues or fiduciary complaints that IEG is aware of.

Overview of Achievement by Objective:
Pillar 1: Promoting Economic Growth
17.
Under this pillar the WBG’s support was to focus on (i) maintaining macroeconomic stability and
reducing vulnerabilities; (ii) accelerating growth and widening the base of growth; and (ii) making growth
environmentally sustainable.
18.
Maintaining macro stability and reducing vulnerabilities. The WBG’s strategy’s
understanding of Peru’s policy challenges to face its vulnerabilities included increasing tax collections
while curtailing expenditures, reducing dollarization in the economy, especially dollar-denominated
outstanding bank loans, and adopting hazard and risk management practices that mitigate the impact of
natural disasters. The government’s own strategy in this area focused on continuing to implement a
strong macro-framework that would deliver a sound fiscal policy, low inflation, and de-dollarize the
economy. Indeed Peru had adopted a fiscal responsibility law in 1999, setting a limit of 1.0 percent of
GDP on the structural fiscal deficit, which has been observed since. Peru’s tax revenues increased
from 15.3 percent of GDP in 2006 to 16 percent in 2008, the CPS’s benchmark, but then declined to
15.2 percent in 2010, the latest year for which data is available. The government increased spending
temporarily to counter the economic slowdown of 2009, using part of the resources saved under the
fiscal rule, while maintaining the structural deficit below the statutory limit. The de-dollarization of the
monetary system continued the trend of recent decades, with dollar-denominated bank loans declining
from 50.8 percent of total loans in 2006 to 38.5 percent in 2011. The de-dollarization reflects many
years of monetary prudence that have brought Peru’s inflation rate from hyperinflation levels in the late
1980s to one of the lowest in Latin America. On natural disaster preparedness and mitigation, the
Ministry of Finance has created a risk management directorate and is adjusting investment standards
and regulations. However, most of these accomplishments were in areas outside the purview, or
capacity to influence of the WBG.
19.
IBRD supported fiscal performance through a programmatic series of Fiscal Management and
Competitiveness DPLs (FY07-FY10). On the tax revenue side the lead agency was the IMF, while IBRD
and IADB played supporting roles. On the expenditure side IBRD’s support focused on institutional
issues (reviewed under Pillar 3) and on expenditure priorities at the time of the global financial crisis.
These interventions were well inside the framework of the fiscal responsibility law. As for dedollarization, the WBG had no bearing on the Central Bank’s policy of maintaining a stable and
convertible currency, which is the driver behind the gradual shift from dollars into soles in the Peruvian
monetary system observed in recent decades. On natural disaster preparedness and mitigation, IBRD
provided support through a Catastrophe DPL Deferred Drawdown Option approved in late 2010
(US$100 million), in the wake of ―El Niño‖ and ―La Niña‖. This intervention supplements the US$ 300

CPSCR Review

6

million support provided by the Corporacion Andina de Fomento (CAF) in 2009, after Peru recovered
from the 2007 earthquake. As for analytical work, IBRD delivered a Public Expenditure Review, a series
of policy notes, and a brief comparative note on the cost of tax compliance for taxpayers based on
surveys carried out in several countries.
20.
IBRD also contributed to this general objective by providing contingent financing to help
manage financial risk and mitigate the impact of the global financial crisis. Peru drew on its own
reserves in 2008 and, for 2009, put together an external financial package that included US$ 2 billion in
bond placements in international financial markets, US$ 1.4 million in DPL DDOs from IBRD, US$400
million from CAF, and additional financing from IADB. Even though Peru did not draw the bulk of the
resources from IBRD’s DPL DDOs, these operations provided financing assurances, easing Peru’s
return to the international bond market. Some of these operations are highlighted in the Peru CPE.
21.
Accelerating growth and widening the base of growth. The WBG strategy had a broad
focus in this objective. Its scope covered international market access and trade, the business
environment, physical infrastructure, technological capacity, extractive industries, rural infrastructure,
access to microfinance, informality, and expanding labor intensive sectors. Growth in Peru continues to
be resource based, with some diversification as evidenced by the gradual decline in the share of the
mining sector’s contribution to Peru’s GDP. Moreover, indicators such as the World Economic Forum
(WEF) global competitive index show an improving trend from 3.9 over 7.0 in 2006-07 to 4.2 in 2011-12.
There is little or incomplete information on the other sub-objectives, such as a decrease of informality.
Yet the share of non-traditional exports in total exports declined from 25 to 22 percent from 2006 to
2011.
22.
IBRD supported infrastructure investment through the Regional Transport Infrastructure
Decentralization (FY06, still active), Peru Decentralized Rural Transport (FY07), and Second Rural
Electrification (FY11) projects. The DPL series on Fiscal Management and Competitiveness (FY07FY10) contributed to improved expenditure management, stressing the importance of the public
investment program at the time of fiscal restraint. A more detailed discussion of the WBG activities in
infrastructure can be found in the Peru CPE. Most of the lending designed to achieve the other subobjectives were either dropped or postponed. Analytical work supporting this objective comprised
Recent Economic Developments in Infrastructure (FY10), the National Gas Strategy (FY10), and the
Small Hydropower non-lending technical assistance (FY08), as well as economic sector work on
informality, labor, capital markets, and an FSAP update.
23.
IFC’s contribution to this objective was mainly through investments and advisory services in
mining, energy, and transportation. The pre-FY07 equity investments in gold and copper mining
continued, and new equity investments were made in copper mining—these are the ―traditional‖ sectors
of the Peruvian economy. Investments in the energy sector were extensive, with the largest investment
in a natural gas liquefaction plant and transmission of the liquefied gas—mainly for exports—and
distribution of gas (in Lima and Callao). In addition, in FY11, a hydroelectric project was approved and
is under construction. On a different front, IFC interventions in the financial sector helped upgrade its
investees—often with support from IFC advisory projects, supporting services such as life-insurance for
the poor, residential mortgages, and penetration into geographically remote areas. In addition, IFC
helped establish a secondary mortgage market company. IFC also provided loan guarantees for
improvement of transportation services in Lima and Arequipa municipalities.
24.
Early in the CPS period, IFC made a large investment (both loan and equity) to develop a gas
and oil field, which seems to have fallen short of financial expectations. This investment, however, left
an important footprint in terms of social and institutional development. IFC provided advisory support to
the municipalities benefiting from the royalties paid by this particular investment, which are located in
one of the poorest regions of the country. With IFC’s support, the municipalities used those resources
to invest in local schools, roads, and other infrastructure.
25.
MIGA’s largest guarantee was for a mining project. On transportation, MIGA provided a
guarantee to facilitate the upgrading of Lima’s airport. MIGA also guaranteed an investment of an
Ecuadoran bank in Peru.

26.
Making growth environmentally sustainable. The strategy focused on improving regulations,
institutional frameworks, and developing awareness in the public and the government as a whole about
the importance of environment conservation. To the extent that frameworks and regulations are preconditions for environmental sustainability, indeed Peru appears to be moving towards a more
environmentally-conscious approach to development. But there is yet no concrete evidence of
environmental improvement in Peru. Between 2006 and 2009, CO2 emissions appear unchanged, the
marine protected areas have only increased slightly from 2.8 percent of total territorial waters to 3.0
percent, while the forest area has declined from 53.7 percent of Peru’s territory to 53.1 percent.
Moreover, the Ministry of Health reports and remains concerned about the high levels of air pollution in
the Lima-Callao area, which it monitors regularly. Nevertheless, the Ministry of the Environment is now
monitoring the implementation of commitments of licensed businesses, has contingency plans on air
quality for the most polluted cities, and is following up on mining legacies that pose a health and
environmental threat to neighboring communities.
27.
The most significant WBG intervention was a programmatic series of two Environmental DPLs
(FY09, FY10), and the main piece of analytical work was a Country Environmental Assessment (FY06).
The interventions also included support through five Global Environment Facility (GEF) trust fund AAAs.
28.
IEG rates the outcome of the WBG strategy in Pillar 1 as moderately satisfactory. IEG notes
that Peru’s own accomplishments in these areas, particularly on growth and macroeconomic stability
are noteworthy. IEG also highlights the timeliness of the WBG’s support to Peru at the time of the
global financial crisis, which was instrumental in helping the country access world bond markets, as well
as the additionality of IFC’s intervention in supporting municipalities use their royalties benefiting their
poor communities. With WBG support, Peru has improved public expenditure efficiency, some rural
infrastructure, as noted in the Peru CPE, and environmental frameworks and regulations. The WBG
made little progress in helping Peru reduce informality or promote non-traditional labor intensive sectors
of the Peruvian economy, and came late in the CPS period with assistance on disaster preparedness
and mitigation. IEG does not consider as satisfactory outcomes of the WBG strategy those that are fully
achieved by the country without a clear contribution from the WBG, as was the case with dedollarization or the fiscal responsibility rule.
Pillar 2: Enhancing Social Development
29.
Under this pillar the WBG’s support was to focus on (i) meeting basic needs; and (ii) promoting
and developing a new social contract in education, health, and nutrition.
30.
Meeting Basic Needs. The WBG’s strategy covered as basic needs water and sanitation,
electricity, and housing and property rights. Between 2006 and 2010, strong economic growth and a
pro-active government strategy led to a decrease in Peru’s index of unmet basic needs from 34 to 26
percent for the whole population and from 62 to 47 percent for the rural population. The share of
Peruvian’s with access to treated water sources increased from 71.6 percent in 2006 to 74.1 percent in
2009, while that with access to sanitation increased from 72.4 percent to 74.8 percent in the same
period. A significant improvement took place in the share of rural households with access to electricity,
which increased from 28.9 percent in 2006 to 55.0 percent in 2010. There is no information, however,
on progress on housing and property rights.
31.
Main IBRD interventions to support this objective were the National Rural Water Supply and
Sanitation Project (FY05), and the Rural Electrification Project (FY06). In addition, the WBG delivered
two pieces of AAA: Poverty Monitoring and Information Systems (FY08), and Extreme Poverty—
Effectiveness of Antipoverty Intervention I (FY10). An update of the latter was delivered in FY11, late in
the CPS period. The impact of the WBG interventions on the infrastructure aspects of meeting basic
needs are discussed in detail in the Peru CPE.
32.
Promoting and developing a new social contract in education, health, and nutrition. The
focus of the WBG strategy was on quality of education, on improving health indicators and organizing
health care more in line with the evolving epidemiological profile, and on reducing malnutrition,
especially of children. Outcomes were mixed. On education, for the period 2007 to 2010, the

CPSCR Review
Independent Evaluation Group

8

standardized test used by Peru to measure progress in reading and mathematics of second grade
students show that, at the national level, the proportion of students in the highest of three achievement
levels increased from 15.9 to 28.7 percent and from 7.2 to 13.8 percent, respectively. The general
improvement, however, hides troublesome developments, such as an increase of the proportion of rural
students in the lowest achievement group in mathematics from 66.1 to 72.9 percent in 2007-10, and
decline in performance, especially in mathematics, between 2009 and 2010. As noted in the Peru
CPE, the WBG’s ―contribution in education was undermined by limited progress in institutional reform
as well as its difficult relationship with the Ministry of Education.‖ On health, a reform of the health
insurance system resulted in higher affiliation rates all over the country, as well as in an increase of
over 40 percent in the health insurance budget. Births under institutional coverage increased from 63
percent (2007) to over 73 percent (2010) in the ten poorest regions, below the 75 percent target in the
CPS. There is no information on how the health care has evolved to adapt to the changing
epidemiological profile. Peru also made progress in reducing national chronic malnutrition, but
seemingly short of the CPS target.
33.
The WBG’s main lending was through the Results and Accountability in Social Sectors
(REACT) DPL series (FY07-11), and the Health Reform APL II (FY09). In addition, the WBG provided
the following technical assistance and economic sector work to support this objective: Juntos for
Nutrition non-lending technical assistance (FY10), Results in Nutrition for Juntos SWAp (FY11), Health
Reform Program (FY09), technical assistance in the Education Sector (FY10) and Universal Insurance
Health Reform (FY11), as well as several pieces of economic sector work on the effectiveness of antipoverty intervention in extreme poverty cases. The bulk of the WBG interventions focused on defining
standards that families could expect from social services, developing monitoring systems, and providing
individualized data for parents on the learning, health and nutrition status of their children.
34.
In line with IFC’s approach in the health sector, IFC—with Peru Fund, an IFC investee—has
recently approved investment in a hospital providing cutting edge oncology and cardiology services that
will benefit mostly the middle-income groups.
35.
IEG rates the outcome of the WBG strategy in Pillar 2 as moderately satisfactory. Peru made
some progress in bringing down the index of unmet needs, and, with WBG support, in increasing
access to water, sanitation and electricity. Peru also made progress, with mixed results in some cases,
in improving the quality of education, the coverage of health services, and nutrition. There is no
information on progress on housing and property rights, and on how health services have been adapted
to the evolving epidemiological profile .
Pillar 3: Modernizing Institutions
36.
Under this pillar the WBG’s strategy aimed at supporting continuing progress on
decentralization and public service access, strengthening public sector management, and improving the
justice system and reducing corruption.
37.
Furthering decentralization and access to public services. The movement toward
decentralization, which had gained force under President Toledo, slowed down under President Garcia
and is still, under President Humala, in the process of defining its objectives and modalities, particularly
regarding the transfer of resources and responsibilities. Peru, nonetheless, has worked on
strengthening local governments, as reviewed below. These efforts, however, have yet to bear fruit in
terms of a stronger role for local governments and communities, as well as improved public service
delivery at that level. Indeed, public service delivery outcomes show mixed progress, with a gradual
improvement in some cases. Over the period of 2007-2009, net pre-primary school enrollment
increased from 65 to 76 percent, while net primary school enrollment declined from 97 to 95 percent,
and net secondary enrollment improved from 75 to 78 percent. In the health sector, between 2007 and
2010, the immunization for measles and DPT of children ages 12-23 months decreased from 95 and 97
percent, respectively, to 94 and 93 percent. Meanwhile, the share births attended by skilled health staff

The WBG supported efforts in this area through the early DPLs of the programmatic series.

39.
Strengthening public sector management. During the CPS period Peru made some
progress in strengthening its public sector management. The World Bank Institute (WBI) indicator for
Governance Effectiveness, which reflects perceptions of the quality of public services, the quality of the
civil service, the degree of its independence from political pressures, the quality of policy formulation
and implementation, and the credibility of the government's commitment to such policies, albeit still in
the negatives, improved from -0.53 in 2006 to -0.21 in 2010, within a range that goes from -2.50 (weak)
to 2.50 (strong). Similarly, the Wastefulness of Government Spending sub-index of the Global
Competitive Index of the World Economic Forum improved from 2.9 over 7.0 in 2006-2007 to 3.8 in
2011-2012. In terms of specific policy actions, the Ministry of Finance adopted a unified treasury
account, and introduced results-based budgeting for five strategic pilot programs in 2008, expanding
the scope of the program to twenty four programs in 2011. In addition, as a result of the implementation
of the Participatory Budget Law, many sub-national governments follow participatory budget norms in
the preparation of the investment budget, but the system still needs mainstreaming and refining, as only
36 percent of the budgets rely on a participatory process. Also, most local governments are using an
integrated financial administration system introduced during the CPS period. Moreover, many
municipalities are now better equipped to gain access and use their royalties from the extractive sector.
Many of these efforts took place after the Peru CPE period, and explain the higher rating in this review.
40.
IBRD provided support in strengthening public sector management as part of the DPL
programmatic series, especially the Results and Accountability in Social Sectors DPL series (FY07,
FY09, and FY11). The main analytical work in support of better fiscal management was a Public
Financial Management Performance Report (jointly with the EU and IADB). Additional AAA included
Municipal Debt (FY07), Government and Governability Enhancement (FY09), Social and Distributional
Impact Analysis of the Participatory Budget in Peru (FY10), and, late in the CPS period,
Decentralization and Quality of Education (FY11) and Public Expenditure Sub-national Pilots (FY11).
41.
IFC, aside from the support provided to the municipalities that benefited from the royalties from
its investment, joined efforts with CIDA, DFID and USAID to implement the Canon (royalty)
Management and the Improving Municipal Investment projects in five regions.
42.
Improving the justice system and reducing corruption. Overall, there was a slight
improvement in the justice system indicators and no significant change in the corruption indicators. The
WBI indicator for Rule of Law, which reflects perceptions of the extent to which agents have confidence
in and abide by the rules of society, and in particular the quality of contract enforcement, property rights,
the police, and the courts, as well as the likelihood of crime and violence, albeit still in the negatives,
improved from -0.75 in 2006 to -0.61 in 2010, within a range that goes from -2.50 (weak) to 2.50
(strong). Also, Latinobarómetro’s surveys shows that the approval rating of the judicial system
increased from 13 percent in 2006 to 20 percent in 2012, while the disapproval rating declined from 76
percent to 69 percent in the same period. Moreover, a 2009 Social Assessment of a judicial project
found that only 35 percent of surveyed case attorneys expressed satisfaction with the courts and their
operation in Peru. In regard to corruption indicators, the WBI indicator for Control of Corruption,
reflecting perceptions of the extent to which public power is exercised for private gain, including both
petty and grand forms of corruption as well as "capture" of the state by elites and private interests,
remained in the negatives and barely moved from -0.22 in 2006 to -0.23 in 2010, within a range that
goes from -2.50 (weak) to 2.50 (strong). In terms of specific policy actions, the government introduced a
program to provide legal assistance and alternative dispute resolution mechanisms to the poor and
marginalized groups (Centros de Asistencia Legal Gratuita, ALEGRA).
43.
The main interventions by the WBG were the Justice Services Improvement Project I and II
(FY04, FY11). The latter is just beginning its implementation, while the former propped justice services
in selected districts, worked on human resource management and supported some of the legal aid
clinics that ALEGRA has.
44.
IEG rates the outcome of the WBG strategy in Pillar 3 as moderately satisfactory. Peru made
progress in strengthening public sector management and, with support from the WBG, established a

CPSCR Review

unified treasury account, and is making headway in results-based budgeting at the national level,
participatory investment budgeting at the local level, and mainstreaming an integrated financial
administration system at the sub-national level. Spending of royalties by some local governments is
also benefiting local communities. Peru continues to work on improving its justice system and abating
corruption, but progress has been slow and not entirely successful, despite having established an
effective mechanism to aid the poor and marginalized in their dealings with the justice system. The
decentralization process came to a halt for political reasons early in the CPS period, making the WBG’s
objective of supporting it immaterial.

Overall outcome:
45.
IEG rates the overall outcome of the WBG strategy in Peru as moderately satisfactory. IEG notes
that Peru’s own accomplishments in many areas, particularly on growth, macroeconomic stability, dedollarizing the monetary system, and addressing some basic needs are remarkable—these achievements
are mostly attributable to Peru’s own efforts. IEG also highlights the timeliness of the WBG’s support to
Peru at the time of the global financial crisis, which was instrumental in helping the country access world
bond markets, as well as the additionality of IFC’s intervention in supporting municipalities use their
royalties to benefit poor communities. With WBG support, Peru has improved public expenditure
efficiency, some rural infrastructure as noted in the Peru CPE, and environmental frameworks and
regulations, as well as increased access to water, sanitation and electricity, also highlighted in the Peru
CPE. Peru made progress in strengthening public sector management and, with support from the WBG,
established a unified treasury account, and is making headway in results-based budgeting at the national
level, participatory investment budgeting at the local level, and mainstreaming an integrated financial
administration system also at the sub-national level. Spending of royalties by some local governments is
also benefiting local communities. With mixed results, Peru worked on improving the quality of education,
the coverage of health services, and nutrition, and continues to work on improving its justice system and
abating corruption, albeit slowly and with uneven outcomes. There is no information about progress on
housing and property rights, and on how health services have been adapted to the evolving
epidemiological profile. The WBG made little progress in helping Peru reduce informality or promote
non-traditional labor intensive sectors of the Peruvian economy, and came late in the CPS period with
assistance on disaster preparedness and mitigation. The country’s decentralization process came to a
halt for political reasons early in the CPS period, making immaterial the WBG’s objective of supporting it.
IBRD Performance:
46.
IBRD performance is rated moderately satisfactory. IBRD reacted quickly and promptly to support
Peru when it requested assistance to face the global financial crisis, and demonstrated flexibility in its
AAA program. The WBG’s strategy and program were generally aligned with Peru’s development
strategy. However, authorities’ feedback suggests that the initial policy platform developed under the
CPS was short on detail, lacked agreement on specific interventions expected from the WBG, and could
have given the wrong impression that Peru was going to use WBG services extensively in its

CPSCR Review
Independent Evaluation Group

11

implementation of policies. In the event, Peru went its own way on developing its policies, and the
dialogue with the authorities was not as fluid as needed for IBRD to adapt its own projects and programs
to the government’s changing policy intentions. As a result, projects such as the decentralization in social
sectors and rural education performed poorly. Moreover, the strategy lacked relevance of design, by
including objectives that were not supported by appropriate IBRD interventions, or by having loose links
between the objectives and the interventions. This was the case particularly under Pillar 1, where IBRD
interventions, which were micro in scope, could not be expected to deliver the anticipated higher-order
macro-objectives. The tourism and informality objectives were not supported by adequate interventions. In
addition, some of the macro objectives in Pillar I (on inflation and de-dollarization for example) were
outside the WBG’s purview, and capacity to influence. On a different dimension, the monitoring and
evaluation framework of the strategy was weak, sometimes based on inexistent indicators or wrong
baselines. The strategy was well-coordinated between IBRD, IFC and MIGA, but operations were poorly
coordinated, especially between IBRD and IFC.
IFC Performance:
47.
IEG rates performance of IFC as satisfactory. IFC had an extensive program providing risk capital
to private sector activities and services to the poor. IFC’s role to improve services to the poor came mostly
through an opportune intervention with demonstrated additionality, by helping the neighboring
municipalities of one of its investees use the royalties of the investment in new schools, health services,
and road infrastructure. This intervention could have been scaled up had IFC and IBRD coordinated
better their activities in Peru.
MIGA Performance:
48.
IEG rates performance of MIGA as moderately satisfactory. MIGA has developed a diversified
portfolio with demand coming from developed and emerging market countries. However, using
IFC investments and the growth enjoyed by the country as proxies for the opportunity for new MIGA
business, the volume of MIGA guarantees appears to be modest.

5. Assessment of CPS Completion Report
49.
This is a well-written CPSCR. It is detailed and comprehensive on the activities undertaken by the
WBG. However, the CPSCR could have covered some of the country outcomes that correspond to the
strategy objectives. It could also have been more forthcoming and dealt more in-depth with those areas
of the program where things did not go well, to find out the reasons and draw lessons. The CPSCR could
have also offered more information on the role of the government and other development partners in the
achievement of the objectives of the WBG strategy.

6. Findings and Lessons
50.
IEG underscores four lessons stemming from this review. First, the WBG has greater
development effectiveness when it aligns its strategy with the government’s own program, as evidenced
by the highly effective intervention supporting Peru’s actions to deal with the effects of the global financial
crisis. By contrast, the WBG had less effective interventions in areas with little country buy in, such as the
decentralization in social sectors and rural education. Second, the development effectiveness of the
WBG can only be demonstrated where there are interventions that can help the country deliver the
expected results. By contrast, strategy objectives that are beyond the purview of the WBG, although
achieved by the country, are not a demonstration of the WBG’s development effectiveness. Third, WBG
strategies gain efficacy when they have a monitoring and evaluation framework that is based on available
and verified data, and that can actually be used by the WBG to actively play out its strategy. Within this
review, those objectives that were better monitored were the ones that showed the best development
results. Fourth, the WBG could find ways of improving coordination within the Group itself to take
advantage of good initiatives that can be scaled up for the benefit of the country, as could have been the
case with IFC’s work with the municipalities that were receiving the royalties of its investees.

The CPS planned an IBRD lending envelope of up to US$3.5 billion or up to US$700 million per annum during FY07-FY11. But it was not explicit
about a breakdown of lending by operation, except to say that fast disbursing policy loans were expected to average US$400 million per year, reaching
a maximum of US$2 billion over the CPS period.
