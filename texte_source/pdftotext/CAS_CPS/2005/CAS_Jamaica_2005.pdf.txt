Executive Summary
Jamaica’s economic performance has improved since the CAS Progress Report
1.
in 2002. Real GDP growth has accelerated from 1 percent in 2001/02 to 2 percent in
2003/04 and i s projected to be 1.5 percent in 2004/05 in spite o f the impact o f Hurricane
Ivan. Jamaica’s medium-term growth prospects are generally good and improving as a
result o f significant planned investments in key sectors including tourism, bauxite
mining, telecommunications, power generation and infrastructure. Opportunities are also
expected to be created by the formation o f the Caribbean Single Market and Economy
(CSME), an economic union o f Caribbean countries which w i l l facilitate the free
movement o f people, capital, goods and services. The transition to the Free Trade Area
o f the Americas (FTAA) may also unlock economic opportunities for Jamaica.
2.
However, Jamaica faces ongoing and emerging challenges which could
compromise i t s longer-term growth prospects. One o f the major challenges i s the large
debt burden-one o f the highest ratios of total debt to GDP and domestic debt to GDP in
the world. Achieving sustained growth w i l l involve dealing w i t h the growing debt
burden on an urgent basis. Another major challenge i s the high levels o f crime and
violence which are estimated to cost society at least 4 percent o f GDP. Crime and
violence are largely concentrated amongst the poorest in society and amongst young
males (14-24 years) who often tend to be the victims as well as the perpetrators o f violent
crime. Poor educational outcomes are also a major challenge with which Jamaica must
contend in order to improve competitiveness and reduce poverty. The performance o f
Jamaica’s economy i s also likely to be impacted b y the reduction in trade preferences for
and bananas. As a small open economy in the
two o f i t s major exports-sugar
Caribbean, Jamaica i s prone to both external economic shocks as well as natural disasters
that could have severe negative impacts on the economy. The recent Hurricane Ivan
(with damage estimated at 8 percent of GDP) was a stark reminder o f this vulnerability.
The Government o f Jamaica has articulated a Medium Term Socio-Economic
3.
Policy Framework (MTSEPF) covering the period April 2004 to March 2009. This
policy framework, aimed at responding to the major ongoing and emerging challenges
facing Jamaica, resulted f r o m wide public consultations and enjoys strong donor support.
I t provides a systematic and comprehensive approach to the development of the country
in the medium-term.

The World Bank Group Strategy and Program
4.
The World Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy for FY06-09 i s aligned
with the government’s M e d i u m Term Socio-Economic Policy Framework and i s based
on three mutually reinforcing pillars:

(i) accelerating inclusive economic growth;
(ii) improving human development and opportunity; and
(iii) crime prevention and reduction.

1

The strategy also emphasizes the two cross-cutting themes o f governance and
5.
environmental sustainability. The strategy i s the result o f close collaboration with the
government and has benefited from wide consultations with c i v i l society and other
donors. In recognition o f the limited fiscal space, the program i s focused, addressing
only key priority areas that have strong ownership, not just within the Government, but
also within the Opposition and civil society.

6.
IBRD would focus on providing technical and financial assistance for improving
basic infrastructure in inner city areas as well as crime prevention and reduction. In
addition, i t would support early childhood education and development in the context o f a
Sector Wide Approach (SWAP) and interventions targeted at youth at risk. IBRD would
also assist the Government in implementing innovative community driven development
activities focused on rural development. IBRD could also support the Government’s
fiscal consolidation and public sector reforms, including education sector reform and the
institutionalization o f a Medium Terrn Expenditure Framework as a tool for expenditure
consolidation. Through i t s existing portfolio, IBRD w i l l continue to provide support to
expand access and improve quality in secondary education as well as to improve schoolbased management; enhance the efficiency and effectiveness o f the social safety net;
support the prevention and control o f HIV/AIDS; and improve community infrastructure.
As part o f the assistance program, IBRD would undertake analytical work including a
Poverty Assessment, a Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP, jointly with the
IMF), a Country Fiduciary Assessment (CFA, jointly with IDB), and a Diagnostic of
Investment Climate. “On demand” policy notes would be prepared which respond to
short term issues including debt and fiscal management issues and informal monitoring of
macroeconomic developments would be continued given the vulnerability o f the
economy. Jamaica w i l l also benefit from the dissemination of key analytical work on
growth and public expenditure completed in 2004 and 2005, to build wide and strong
ownership for further structural reforms and f r o m ongoing and planned Caribbean-wide
studies, including on issues o f growth and competitiveness, social protection and pension
reform, migration and remittances, crime, violence and social exclusion, health financing,
infrastructure and financial sector.
7.
I F C w i l l focus on investing in infrastructure, the financial sector, services and
other sectors where Jamaica has a comparative advantage. Where appropriate, I F C w i l l
also selectively provide financial and advisory services. Based on the findings o f the
FSAP, I F C could play a key role in providing long term finance for the domestic and
regional expansion o f strong companies operating in Jamaica and facilitate access to
finance for SMEs and micro enterprises.
8.
MIGA w i l l support the development o f the financial sector, particularly in i t s
ability to provide long-term financing. MIGA w i l l also continue to provide support for
the development o f key infrastructure including the ports through the provision o f
guarantees.

Managing Risks

9.
The CAS has three scenarios with different IBRD lending volumes and number
o f operations-low,
base and high. The base case lending scenario includes four
operations for a total of US$75 million over four years. The high case lending scenario
consists of a development policy loan o f US$75 million in addition to the base case,
bringing the total lending envelope to US$l50 million. In the l o w case scenario,
resulting f r o m a deterioration o f portfolio performance and/or a deterioration o f key
macroeconomic indicators, no new lending would be processed and the Bank would
focus on the implementation o f i t s current portfolio and intensify i t s macroeconomic
dialogue w i t h the Government.
10.
K e y risks are the country’s vulnerability to natural disasters and to external
economic shocks, policy slippage or reversal, notably in the wake o f the 2007 elections,
and the population’s fatigue with the significant and sustained high level o f fiscal
adjustment required b y the high debt burden. The CAS program tries to manage these
risks through careful selection of triggers and monitoring o f progress, continued support
for disaster prevention and mitigation, a focus on priority areas which have broad
ownership in the country, and linking fast disbursing lending to policy implementation
progress and results. The government and the International Development Partners have
initiated a dialogue aimed at developing a joint results-based monitoring and evaluation
framework to monitor the results under the Medium-Term Socio-Economic Policy
Framework. In keeping with the commitment under the Harmonization and Alignment
initiative to shift to the use of country systems, the CAS Progress Report w i l l present a
comprehensive Results Framework.
Agenda for Board Consideration
Board Members may wish to discuss, among others, the following aspects o f
11.
this CAS:
I s the CAS program an adequate response to Jamaica’s needs as a highly indebted
middle income country?
I
(ii) s the balance between planned investment lending, policy-based lending and
analytical work adequate to support a continuation o f the Government’s structural
reforms?
(iii) Are the triggers and the risk mitigation framework adequate?

JAMAICA: WORLD BANK GROUP
COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY FOR FY06-09

I. Overview
1.
Jamaica has recently emerged from a financial crisis following a long period o f
disappointing GDP growth. Previous Bank assistance has focus on restoring growth,
protecting the poor, improving governance and environmental sustainability. Growth has
returned and some progress has been made in protecting the poor through an improved
social safety net program. There have also been some improvements in governance,
including better delivery of public services through Executive Agencies. In order to reap
further sustained reduction in poverty, Jamaica needs to accelerate inclusive growth,
improve human development and opportunity, and reduce crime and violence. However,
there are enormous challenges presented b y the large debt overhang and the consequent
limited fiscal space. In addition, Jamaica’s vulnerability to natural disasters and external
economic shocks are continuing challenges.
2.
The Government has articulated a Medium-Term Socio-Economic Policy
Framework that attempts to respond to these challenges. The World Bank Group’s
support to Jamaica-a highly indebted middle income country-builds on this framework
and provides a very focused program over the period FY06-09 based on three mutually
reinforcing pillars: (i)accelerating inclusive economic growth; (ii)
improving human
development and opportunity; and (iii)
crime prevention and reduction.

11. The Country Context
Political Context
3.
Jamaica has been a stable democracy since i t s independence in 1962. The People’s
National Party (PNP), which has been in power since 1989, i s enjoying an unprecedented
fourth term o f office having been re-elected in October 2002, albeit with a smaller
majority - 34 o f 60 seats, down f r o m 48. In the Local Government elections of June 16,
2003 the Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) won 12 o f the 13 local councils, thereby taking
control o f local government from the PNP. The JLP has since lost one council to the
PNP in a November 2004 by-election. The next general elections are constitutionally due
b y 2007. Local Government elections are likely to be held sooner although there i s no
fixed date. The two main political parties are likely to have new leaders going into the
next general elections. The opposition JLP has already elected a new leader and i t i s
expected that the PNP will elect a new leader when Prime Minister Patterson retires
sometime before the end o f his term in 2007.
4.
Both the Government and the opposition share views on the major challenges
facing Jamaica, including: the large debt, the high levels o f crime and violence and the
poor educational outcomes. Both political parties also strongly support the need for
public sector reform. The Government appears to support a more gradual approach,
including relying on attrition, to address the size o f the public sector. The opposition, on

4

the other hand, has argued for a more radical approach to addressing the size o f the public
sector, including a reduction in the number o f Cabinet posts, ministries and departments.

Economic Context

5.
Jamaica’s economic performance has improved since the CAS Progress Report in
2002. Real GDP growth accelerated from 1 percent in 2001/02 to 2 percent in 2003/04
and i s projected at 1.5 percent in 2004/05, revised downward from 2.5 percent due to the
impact o f Hurricane Ivan in September 2004. The improvement in growth i s being led b y
relatively strong performance in tourism, mining, agriculture and the recovery in the
manufacturing sector.
The fiscal situation has also improved. The central government’s overall public
6.
sector deficit was reduced from 10.8 percent o f GDP in 2002/03 to 8.7 percent in 2003/04
and i s projected at 7.9 percent in 2004-05. The primary surplus has improved from 7
percent in 2002/03 to 10.8 percent o f GDP in 2003/04. The improvement in the fiscal
balance reflected higher revenues, including from additional tax measures, as well as
containment in expenditure. Provisional data for the first half o f 2004105 suggest further
improvements in revenues and continued containment in expenditure, despite the impact
o f Hurricane Ivan, leading to a further increase in the central Government’s primary
surplus to 11.3 percent of GDP. This follows a sustained effort by the Government in
running primary fiscal surpluses in excess o f 7 percent o f GDP for the last five years.

7.
The size o f the overall public sector debt i s one o f the major challenges faced b y the
Government. Jamaica’s debt, which has been increasing steadily since the 1996/97
financial sector crisis, hit a new high o f about 146 percent o f GDP in 2002103. The sharp
growth in the debt was fueled by rising wages and salary costs as well as the sharp
increases in domestic interest rates which peaked at around 34 percent at the end o f
2002/03. This interest rate increase resulted f r o m the Central Bank’s efforts to stem
pressure o n the currency which came under severe pressure in early 2003, depreciating b y
almost 20 percent between April and May. Approximately 25 percent o f the debt
consists o f variable-rate instruments linked to the six-month Treasury bill yield. Partly
reflecting the double-digit inflation, the public debt t o GDP ratio i s projected to decline
from 143 percent in 2003/04 to 137 percent in 2004/05.
Interest rates have stabilized at around 15 percent in 2004/05. The moderation o f
8.
interest rates in part reflects the market’s confidence in the government’s commitment to
a tighter fiscal policy and that the public sector borrowing requirement i s likely to be
reduced. In response to the significant exchange rate depreciation in late 2002 and early
2003 as well as the new tax measures imposed in the 2003/04 budget and the o i l price
increase, inflation rose to 12.9 percent in 2003/04, the first double digit inflation since
1996. Average inflation i s projected to be 11.7 percent in 2004/05 on account o f
adjustments to electricity tariffs and, in the wake o f Hurricane Ivan, increases in prices o f
food and raw material.
9.
The sharp recovery in the tourist industry, increased demand and better prices for
alumina, and the recovery of agricultural exports combined with a decline in imports led
to a narrowing o f the external current account deficit to 6.5 percent o f GDP in 2003/04
from 14.9 percent of GDP in 2002/03 (Table 1). The current account deficit i s projected
5

to widen in 2004/05 to 10.2 percent o f GDP as a result o f higher o i l prices and increased
imports o f food, raw materials and capital goods in the wake o f Hurricane Ivan. The net
international reserves also rose b y over US$200 million to US$1.6 billion in 2003/04 and
now stand at about US$1.8 billion (or 4.5 months o f imports) - the highest level in two
years.

10. The Government has improved financial sector regulation and supervision since the
financial crisis in 1996/97. In the banking sector, minimum capital requirements were
raised to 10 percent o f risk-weighted capital (1999); recognition o f non-performing loans
was tightened to 3 months from 6 months; stronger guidelines were issued for
provisioning, loan renegotiation, suspension o f accrued interest on non-performing loans
and loan write-offs; and limits on connected lending and concentration o f lending have
been introduced. Regarding the non-bank intermediaries, the Government has enacted an
Insurance L a w to serve as the basis for regulation and supervision in the sector. In 2001,
the Financial Services Commission was established to regulate and supervise securities,
insurance and pensions. The strengthening o f bank regulation and supervision as well as
the regulation and supervision o f the non-bank sector has corrected many o f the problems
which existed prior to the financial crisis and identified in the 2001 assessment o f the
Base1 Core Principles. In general, prudential indicators o f commercial banks and other
deposit taking institutions regulated by the Bank o f Jamaica have shown improvements
over the last three years. For example, non-performing loans (NPL) as a ratio o f total
loans, fell from 8 percent in 2001/02 to 3.1 percent in 2004/05. Jamaica has also taken
steps to enhance i t s Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing o f Terrorism
(AML/CFT) regime and has an AML regulatory regime in place. The Money Laundering

6

Act (MLA) was approved b y Parliament in 1996 and implemented in 1998. Laws aimed
at reinforcing the A M L / C F T framework are currently before Parliament.
11. Strong reforms but benefits lagging. Since the mid-eighties, Jamaica has made
remarkable progress on first generation reforms including trade and foreign exchange
liberalization. As indicated above, following a financial crisis in 1996197, the authorities
have taken significant steps to strengthen the regulatory environment and supervisory
institutions including the Central Bank. The regulatory environment for business has also
been substantially improved. Jamaica has been cited as one o f the ten countries which
regulate the least owing to i t s aggressive adoption o f best practice regulation over the last
1
decade.
12. Notwithstanding these reform measures, Jamaica has not reaped their benefits due
in large measure to a series o f exogenous shocks and the financial crisis. Jamaica has
been saddled with a large debt overhang, largely the legacy o f the financial crisis but also
due to the assumption of some contingent liabilities and high wage cost from a bloated
public sector. The high cost o f servicing the debt has not only squeezed expenditure in
the key social sectors including education and health but has also limited public
investment to less than 2 percent o f GDP-a level inadequate to support sustained private
sector growth.

Poverty Trends
13. Growth has improved but poverty has increased. Despite the return to positive
GDP growth in 2000 following several years o f negative growth, the rate o f poverty
increased-moving from 16.8 percent in 2001 to 19.7 percent in 20022 (see Figure 1).
This development i s in sharp contrast to developments from 1991 to 2001 when, despite a
stagnant economy, Jamaica reduced the rate o f poverty b y half. However, as the 2004
Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) points out, many o f the favorable
circumstances that reduced poverty between 1991 and 2001, including l o w inflation
(resulting largely from a reduction in relative food prices), and growth o f the informal
sector are unlikely to continue in the future.

14. In Jamaica, the profile o f the poor, as established by the annual Survey o f Living
Conditions (SLC), a living standards measurement survey, makes clear that there are
several interrelated factors linked to poverty-large households, households headed by
females, inequities in access to health and education services, l o w educational attainment,
unemployment, especially among youth, underemployment among the working poor and
dependence on informal sector and/or rural employment. In addition, the poor typically
live in overcrowded and substandard housing.

Inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient of consumption in the Survey o f Living Conditions, has not
changed much in the last decade. The Gini was 0. 381 in 1990 and 0. 379 in 2000.

15. Poverty in rural and inner-city areas deserves special attention. The incidence
o f poverty in the rural areas i s more than twice the level in Kingston (Figure 2). In
addition, rural poverty i s more volatile than urban poverty, perhaps tied to the vagaries o f
traditional rain-fed agriculture. However, work done in the 2004 CEM suggests that the
performance o f the agricultural sector may be only a small part o f the puzzle of profound
rural poverty.
Rural poverty i s also related to other concerns, including: poor
infrastructure; limited access to quality education; higher rates o f adult illiteracy; and
more limited employment opportunities. This implies that rural poverty cannot be fixed
by only focusing on domestic agriculture and that there i s a need to give attention to other
issues including infrastructure, social services and human capital development.

16. Notwithstanding the generally lower level o f poverty in the cities, there are pockets
o f high levels o f chronic poverty in many inner-city areas. The pockets of urban poverty
are associated with higher levels o f crime, violence and other anti-social behavior that
contribute to perpetuating chronic poverty by limiting access to social services including
health and education or restricting employment opportunities.

8

17. Poverty in rural townships presents a mix o f urban and rural features. I t remains
consistently higher than in the Kingston Metropolitan Area (KMA) but lower than in
rural areas and i s even more volatile than rural poverty. At the same time, many o f the
problems o f urban areas, including high-density areas with poor quality infrastructure and
with increasing levels o f crime and violence, can be seen in rural townships.

18. Poverty and Gender. There i s a strong gender dimension to poverty. Femaleheaded households account for about two-thirds o f the households in poverty and
generally show a higher incidence o f poverty in all the surveys since 1989 (CEM, 2004).
In 2002, the per capita consumption in female-headed households (J$7,795) was nearly
22 percent lower than in male headed households. The higher level o f poverty in femaleheaded households reflects: (i)higher level o f unemployment among women (17.6
percent) compared with men (9.7 percent); larger female-headed households (3.6 persons
compared with 3.2 persons for male headed households); and the fact that female-headed
households tend to be single income households.

half o f the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). However, progress in meeting the
4
three health-related MDGs i s o f concern.
As Table 2 shows, Jamaica i s unlikely to
achieve goals related to the reduction in the infant, child and maternal mortality rates. I t
i s also unlikely to halt and reverse the spread of H I V / A I D S b y 2015.
Prospects for Future Growth
20. Hurricane Ivan o f September 2004 trimmed GDP in 2004105 as a result o f
temporary disruptions in key sectors including tourism, bauxite mining, agriculture and
utilities. However, the medium-term growth prospects for Jamaica are generally good
and improving as a result o f significant planned investments in key sectors including
tourism, bauxite mining, telecommunications, power generation and infrastructure
(primarily roads, seaports and airports). However, achieving and maintaining higher
growth through the long-term i s likely to be hindered by the large debt overhang. This
reflects three elements.
21. First, high public debt tends to crowd-out private investment and reduces bank
incentives for financing private investment and entrepreneurs to take risk, since l o w risk,
high returns are available on government debt. High public debt and the segmentation o f
the credit market have probably affected mostly small borrowers who are riskier and
unable to access foreign credit markets.
22. Second, within the public budget, the high debt servicing arising from the debt has
crowded out public sector investment (which fell to a l o w o f about 1 percent o f GDP in
2003/04).
This reduces “crowding-in”, the positive impact o f public on private
investment, such as in tourism. Continued inadequacy o f infrastructure (which i s at least
partly a function o f public investment) also increases the cost o f doing business and
makes the economy less competitive.
23. Similarly, as discussed in the 2005 Public Expenditure Review (PER), debt
servicing has crowded out expenditure on health and education in the budget, even
though Jamaica has strived very hard to maintain such expenditure. The upshot i s that
the non-salary component o f health and education expenditure has been squeezed, and
this can impact long-term competitiveness through the quality o f the labor force.
24. Third, Jamaica’s growth prospects could also be adversely affected b y other factors
including external shocks f r o m higher interest rates in the international capital market,
increases in the price o f o i l or natural disasters to which Jamaica is prone and which
could have an adverse effect on the key growth sectors. Domestic shocks such as social
instability or an increase in the level o f crime and violence may also impact the longer
term growth prospects.

Ongoing and Emerging Challenges and Issues
25. Strategic analytical studies carried out by the Government, the Bank and other
donors in the recent past have identified some o f the key ongoing and emerging

challenges and issues which are impacting or likely to impact on Jamaica’s development
agenda in the short, medium and long term.
26. Debt burden and fiscal imbalance. The analysis in the recent C E M (2004)
suggests that sustained growth w i l l be fundamental to further declines in poverty.
However, achieving sustained growth w i l l involve dealing with the growing debt burden
o n an urgent basis. Jamaica has one o f the highest ratios o f total debt to GDP and
domestic debt to GDP in the world. The analysis in the recent PER suggests that this
level o f debt is only sustainable if the current very high primary surpluses (11 percent o f
GDP) are sustained for long periods. Even so, the debt dynamics remain highly sensitive
to changes in growth and interest rates as well as external and domestic shocks (See
Annex C o n Debt Sustainability)
27. In large part due to the high indebtedness, but also due to past weak fiscal
discipline, Government expenditure has become increasing skewed to recurrent spending.
As a share o f total expenditure, recurrent expenditure increased from 77 percent in
1992/93 to 97 percent in 2003/04. Moreover, interest payments account for the single
largest portion o f the recurrent spending (49 percent in 2003/04).
28. As a result o f the large debt burden, and particularly the large domestic debt,
servicing the debt (interest and principal) has taken an increasingly larger share of the
overall budget, thereby crowding out public sector investments and critical social sector
and program spending. In addition, the credibility o f the budget and i t s use as an

effective tool o f fiscal policy has been compromised by the overarching short-term focus
on the management o f the large debt overhang. Although sustainability o f the large
primary surplus may be politically difficult, the Government does not consider the
restructuring o f the debt a feasible option given the current structure o f the debt (Box 1).

11

29. Pervasive and high crime and violence. Jamaica has one o f the highest rates o f
violent crime in the world. However, i t i s the high murder rate (54 per 100,000 in 2004)
that i s attracting the most concerns in Jamaica. The Crime Rate Indices (CRI) show that
for the past 30 years, violent crimes have increased steadily (1980, a violent election year
i s a clear outlier). Over the 1990s, the murder rate was largely driven b y increasing
levels o f distribution and trans-shipment o f drugs, leading to increased “gang wars”. The
police estimates that drug-related killings now account for more that 20 percent o f the
murders annually. Increased drug trafficking has led to additional security measures on
the port that increase the processing time for perishable products.

30. Crime and violence are also concentrated in the major urban centers, possibly
reflective o f the serious social problems associated with lack o f family ties, growing
urbanization, high unemployment as well as drugs related conflicts. Kingston and St.
Andrew account for only about 27 percent o f Jamaica’s total population but averaged 57
percent o f total murders between 1984 and 2001. Crime and violence in Jamaica are also
largely concentrated amongst the poorest in society and amongst young males (14-24
years) who often tend to be the victims as well as the perpetrators o f violent crime. In
2003, males accounted for 98 percent o f those arrested for major crimes and 49 percent
were from the 16-25 age group. Also, 40 percent o f all major crimes were committed
against young persons. Youth from inner city areas are more likely to be recruited as
drug sellers because o f their relatively lower opportunity cost, given that they are more
likely to be out o f school and unemployed.
31. Gender-based and domestic violence i s also growing o f importance. In general,
statistics indicate that reports o f violent crimes against women are on the rise, though
some o f this, may be due to greater reporting. The number o f rapes and carnal abuses has
increased over the last two years and accounts for over a quarter of the major crimes in
2003. O f the crimes against youth, 65.7 percent o f the victims were females. Domestic
violence also represents a significant proportion o f the reported murders.
32. I t i s estimated that crime costs society at least 4 percent o f GDP annually, including
lost production, health expenses and public and private spending for security. In

12

addition, exporting firms’ security costs can be as high as 5 percent o f sales. Small firms’
losses due to extortion, fraud, robbery and arson can be 9 percent o f revenue, with an
average o f 3-6 percent for firms in manufacturing and distribution (CEM, 2004).
33. In the joint country assistance strategy consultations (together with DFID and IDB)
which were held across Jamaica, i t was pointed out in several instances that crime and
violence were contributing significantly to the number o f disabled, poor persons some o f
whom were transformed from healthy, earning, independent persons. These accounts
provide anecdotal evidence that crime and violence contribute directly and sometimes
almost immediately to personal poverty.
34. Need to improve human development. Health indicators for Jamaica compare
well with other countries with similar or even higher levels o f income; however, the
efficiency o f the public health system and equity in access to quality care are ongoing
problems. In addition, achievement o f the MDG goals with respect to reducing infant
and child mortality, improving maternal health and combating HIV/AIDS i s unlikely.
Continuing health and nutrition concerns include the increasing incidence of HIV/AIDS
(an estimated 1.5 percent o f the adult population affected). Other health concerns include
a persistent pattern o f low-birth weight babies and continued pockets of malnutrition.
The incidence o f low-birth weight babies, malnutrition and preventable illness and
injuries impacts negatively on human capital development.
35. Over the past ten years, Jamaica has devoted an average o f 5.4 percent o f GDP to
education, a significant share o f public spending compared to middle-income countries
and others in the region. As a result o f focused education policy and commitment o f
families to education for their children, Jamaica has succeeded in achieving over 95
percent enrollment at the pre-primary level and universal primary and lower secondary
education for both girls and boys. However, access t o pre-primary and especially to
upper secondary education continues to be linked to income. In addition, a worrying
trend that may be linked to the rise in poverty in recent years i s the fact that enrollment
among all income groups declined between 2000 and 2002. Enrollment among 17 to 18
year olds i s also linked to income and also declined between 2000 and 2002 - from 69 to
62 percent among students f r o m the wealthiest quintile and f r o m 29 percent to 19 percent
among students from the poorest quintiles. The poor quality o f education has meant that
a large share o f students leave the formal education system without the requisite
competencies for the world o f work. Poor education outcomes have significant
implications for the labor market and Jamaica’s overall competitiveness in a global
economy where the terms o f trade are turning increasingly in favor o f knowledge based
industries. Boys are particularly at risk in the education system. Jamaica i s one o f the
few countries in which there i s a reversal o f the normal gender disparity in education as
the ratio o f girls to boys in primary, secondary and tertiary education reveals that girls
have the advantage over boys from grade 10 upwards. This gap widens even further at
the tertiary level.
36. Currently, the youth-at-risk problem i s one o f the most pressing concerns for
Jamaica. The problem o f youth-at-risk i s a complex issue, caused by a multitude o f
underlying factors that affect Jamaican children and adolescents at various developmental
stages, including the poor quality o f education and high rates o f attrition from school;
lack o f employment opportunities; poor reproductive health with related high rates o f

13

teenage pregnancy, STDs and HIV/AIDS; unstable home environments, poor parenting,
lack o f supervision and guidance; high levels o f crime and violence, including drug
related and domestic violence and sexual abuse. Children growing up in poverty, living
in communities affected by violence and unstable home environments are most “at risk. ”

37. H i g h rates of migration o f skilled persons. As the 2004 C E M pointed out, the
rate o f emigration o f the more highly educated workers i s high (over 20,000 per year in
the 1990s) and this off-sets potential improvement in the quality o f the labor force. The
large emigration o f educated Jamaicans raises the issue o f the high cost o f education at
the tertiary level, a significant part o f which i s borne b y the State.
38. Decline in competitiveness. The main challenge confronting private sector
development i s to accelerate growth b y improving Jamaica’s competitiveness. This
declined significantly in the 1990s, reflected in declining shares o f exports in world trade
and in Jamaica’s GDP and stagnation in export earnings. Jamaica’s share o f world
merchandise exports fell steadily from 0.036 percent in 1994 to 0.024 percent in 2001
(CEM, 2004). This was accompanied b y an even larger proportionate decline in the share
of exports to GDP, from 32 percent to 19 percent. This adverse performance has been
closely linked to the appreciation o f the CPI-based real effective exchange rate (REER)
over 1992-98, and an even greater appreciation in the wage-based REER. The very close
link between Jamaica’s share in world merchandise exports and the REER i s also
suggested b y the high correlation coefficient o f -0.6. Similarly, the share o f Jamaica’s
goods and services exports in i t s GDP and the REER has a correlation coefficient o f -0.
8. The decline in Jamaica’s competitiveness i s also related to the poor educational
outcomes, l o w levels o f skills among those seeking employment and a high rate of
migration o f professionals and skilled persons as discussed above as well as the crowding
out o f private investment by high public debt, rising crime and violence and reduced
public investment for basic infrastructure upkeep. In 2004, Jamaica was ranked 65th
among a total o f 104 countries on the Growth Competitiveness Index (GCI)’, compared
with a ranking of 52 in 2001. Of the three indices that comprise the overall GCI, Jamaica
ranked relatively high on the Technology Index (49) but much lower on the Public
Institution Index (69) and the Macroeconomic Environment Index (83).
39. Reduction in trade preferences. The global economy i s being transformed into an
increasingly competitive and liberalized trading environment associated with the erosion
o f trade barriers and bilateral trade preferences.
Jamaica’s preferential trading
arrangements for two o f i t s major export crops, sugar and bananas, are likely to be
significantly eroded over the next few years. In the period o f adjustment, Jamaica i s
likely to face considerable social and economic challenges as these industries face an
increasingly competitive external environment which may in some cases determine the
very survival o f these industries. In 2003, exports o f sugar and bananas together
accounted for about 12.4 percent o f traditional exports which include bauxite and
alumina exports. However, when bauxite and alumina are excluded, sugar and bananas
account for more than half o f traditional exports. In 2003, about 17.6 percent o f the
employed labor force was in agriculture, the bulk o f which i s believed to be in the sugar
and banana sectors.

40. Vulnerability to external economic shocks and natural disasters. As a small
open economy in the Caribbean, Jamaica i s prone to both economic shocks as well as
natural disasters that could have severe negative impact on the economy and on
household welfare. The impact o f the 9/11 events, the recent sharp rise in o i l prices as
well as the impact o f Hurricane Ivan (with damage estimated at 8 percent of GDP) are
poignant reminders o f Jamaica’s continuing vulnerability. H o w to mitigate and respond
to these events in the context o f tight fiscal constraints are ongoing challenges that the
government faces.

111.The Government’s Medium-Term Policy Framework and Priorities for Growth
and Poverty Reduction
41. T o address the ongoing and emerging challenges, the Government o f Jamaica has
articulated a Medium-Term Socio-Economic Policy Framework (MTSEPF) covering the
period April 2004 to March 2009. This policy framework, which resulted from wide
public consultations and enjoys strong donor support, builds on the overarching
framework established in the 1996 National Industrial Policy (NIP), the objective o f
which was to provide a systematic, holistic and comprehensive approach to the
development o f the country into the 21st century.
42. The Government’s Medium-Term policy framework has identified three broad
policy areas for focus:
0
0
0

Medium-Term Economic Framework;
Medium-Term Private Sector Policy Framework; and
Medium-Term Social Policy Framework.

Medium Term Economic Framework
43. Under i t s Medium-Term Economic Framework, the government proposes a m i x o f
monetary, exchange rate and fiscal measures aimed at reducing the public debt-GDP ratio
to about 100 percent o f GDP by 2008/09 through intensified fiscal adjustment and
improved growth. At the request of the authorities, the IMF i s providing intensified
surveillance o f their medium-term macroeconomic program. This economic framework
targets real GDP growth o f about 3-3.5 percent during 2005/06 and 2008/09 with
inflation declining to 5-6 percent by 2008/09. Import requirements o f several major
capital projects to be undertaken b y the private sector in mining, tourism, cement and
other areas may cause the external current account deficit to widen temporarily in the
coming two years (to about 13 percent o f GDP in 2006/07). Over the medium-term, a
two-thirds increase in alumina production capacity and almost doubling in the number o f
hotel rooms are expected to raise mining exports and travel receipts. This, together with
higher remittances and a gradual decline in o i l prices, should help reduce the current
account deficit to about 4 percent o f GDP by 2008/09. The fiscal program targets a
smaller fiscal deficit o f 4-5 percent o f GDP in 2004/05 followed b y a balanced budget in
2005/06 and small surpluses in 2006/07 to 2008/09 (Table 4). The monetary and
exchange rate policies are aimed at the maintenance o f a stable, predictable macro
environment. More specifically, the objective i s for domestic inflation rates to gradually
converge to those of Jamaica’s major trading partners.
15

44. In the fiscal area, the government i s considering the recommendations o f a tax
policy review committee with a view to initiating a comprehensive tax reform program in
the context o f the 2005/06 budget. The authorities’ goal for the tax reform program i s to
increase the efficiency and equity o f the tax system. O n the expenditure side, the
government proposes to pilot the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) in one
o f the major spending sectors-Health, Education or National Security-in 2005. One
significant component o f the non-debt expenditure is the wage bill. To control the wage
bill in real terms, the Government signed a Memorandum o f Understanding (MOU) for
the Public Sector with the Jamaica Confederation o f Trade Unions on February 16, 2004.
Under this M O U , the public sector unions have agreed with the government for a general
policy o f wage restraint in the public sector for the period April 1, 2004 to March 31,
2006. During this period, all wage contracts w i l l be settled within a wage bill increase o f
3 percent in nominal terms. In addition, in order to control employment within the public
sector, i t was agreed that there would be a general policy o f employment constraint
except for certain critical groups o f public servants including: health professionals, police
officers, correctional officers, the Jamaica fire service and teachers. I t was also agreed
that there would be no separation o f employment in the public sector except through
restructuring and mergers o f entities.

45. Acceleration in the implementation o f the Government Medium-Term policy
framework accompanied b y a more favorable external economic environment could have
even higher payoffs, particularly if the Government maintains sustainable primary
surpluses in excess of 11 percent o f GDP, upgrades the education system and addresses
the serious crime problem. Under such a high case macroeconomic scenario, real GDP
growth could average 3.5-4 percent in the medium term and the debt to GDP ratio would
decline to below 100 percent b y 2008/09. Greater investor confidence would raise
investment and facilitate access to financing on better terms in the international markets.

46. Developments in 2004105 and the magnitude and duration o f the fiscal adjustment
envisaged b y the authorities highlight the Jamaican economy’s vulnerability to shocks
and the implementation risks associated with the authorities’ ambitious debt reduction
strategy. The debt dynamics are particularly sensitive to exchange rate and interest rate
shocks, as a result o f the large share (about three-fourths) o f foreign currency and floating
rate debts in total public debt. Also, as indicated above, external shocks from higher
interest rates in the international capital market, increases in the price o f o i l or natural
disasters to which Jamaica i s prone could have adverse effects on the key growth sectors.
Domestic shocks such as social instability or an increase in the level o f crime and
violence could also impact the longer term growth prospects. Under the resulting l o w
case macroeconomic scenario, real GDP growth would not exceed 2 percent, and per
capita incomes would stagnate. The public debt would still decline over the period, but
more slowly, to about 120 percent o f GDP b y 2008/09. This scenario s t i l l assumes an
unchanged primary budget surplus o f 11 percent o f GDP. A n y major slippage o f fiscal
performance would trigger a worse macroeconomic scenario w i t h lower growth rates and
higher inflation.

Medium-Term Private Sector Policy Framework
47. The principal objective o f the Medium-Term Private Sector Policy Framework i s to
resume growth with employment. This growth i s expected to be led by the private sector
based on Jamaica’s comparative advantage in natural resources, location and climate.
The opportunities for tourism and bauxite mining are particularly highlighted.
48. The Government’s private sector policy framework reiterates the message of the
National Industrial Policy (NIP) o f 1996 that the private sector should be the engine o f
growth and commits the Government to continue to disengage f r o m productive activities
and to focus on i t s role as policy maker, regulator and enabler. The Government’s main
private sector strategies include ensuring:
0

a stable macro economic framework;
a positive enabling environment including tackling crime and extortion;
a competitive Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER); and
an improved operating environment with respect to the availability o f
appropriately skilled manpower and reliable and cost effective infrastructure.

49. The Partnership for Progress Initiative, based on Ireland’s Social Partnership model
and coordinated b y the Private Sector Organization o f Jamaica, i s expected to provide the
key platform for a coordinated private sector growth strategy. The Partnership for
Progress Initiative aims t o construct a social partnership including the private sector,
unions and Government to implement the private sector strategies.

Medium-Term Social Policy Framework

50. The Government has also proposed a M e d i u m Term Social Policy Framework that
reaffirms i t s commitment to achieving the Millennium Development Goals as well as
those included in the thematic areas shown in Table 5 below:

reform agendas in health, education and l i f e l o n g learning, social protection, crime
prevention and justice, l a w and order, governance and environmental sustainability.

Health

52. In the health sector, the major challenge i s t o maintain the gains of the past and
address issues related to the changing epidemiological patterns. The prevalence o f
H I V / A I D S i s increasing w i t h an estimated 1.5 percent o f the adult population affected.
In addition, increases in chronic diseases and accidents and injuries have placed
increasing demands o n an already overburdened health care system. At the same time,
some 80-85 percent o f the health budget i s accounted for by wages and salaries w i t h nonwage expenditure squeezed in a w a y that adversely affects the delivery of services. T o
address the major challenges in the health sector, the Ministry of Health i s implementing
a Strategic Plan covering the period 2001 t o 2005. T h e k e y strategic priorities being
addressed include:
0

the determination of the optimal organizational structure f o r the delivery o f high
quality, cost effective health care services;
e. , hospitals,
rationalization o f the number and location of health facilities (i.
clinics) t o optimize the use of scarce resources, particularly qualified medical
staff;
identify appropriate measures f o r retaining professional staff; and

18

review the role o f the private sector, and identify how i t can
effectively complement public sector health provision and financing o f health
provision such as through statutory and voluntary health insurance schemes.

53. T o address the special challenges o f HIV/AIDS, the Government has developed a
specific medium-term HIV/AIDS strategy which focuses on four overarching objectives:
(1) the creation o f an effective multi-sectoral response to the HIV/AIDS/STI epidemic;
(2) the reduction o f individual vulnerability to infection; (3) the reduction o f transmission
o f the virus; and (4) the improvement in care, support and treatment o f People Living
with A I D S (PLWHA). The implementation o f this strategy i s supported by the World
Bank through the ongoing H N / A I D S Prevention and Control project.
Education and Lifelong Learning

54. The Government’s key policy objectives in the medium term are to improve access
to and the quality o f education. T o achieve this, the Government w i l l continue to build
upon previous reforms and those outlined in the 2001 White Paper on Education. These
include:
integrating and expanding Early Childhood Education towards achieving
universal enrollment and the provision o f early stimulation for the 0-3 age
cohort;
providing a place at the upper secondary level for all students b y 2007;
decentralizing school management, stressing participation, performance
and accountability; and
the freezing o f school fees at the secondary level and the scheduled
phasing out o f the cost sharing scheme over the next three years.

55. The Government has also articulated a policy on lifelong learning. The policy
focusing on basic competencies in order to provide additional core skills to
includes: (i)
improve employability o f the working age population; (ii)
moving the focus o f education
and training from youth to lifelong learning; (iii)improving human resources
development planning in the context o f employer productivity enhancement; and (iv)
forging relationships with the private sector to define training needs and provide training
to ensure greater efficiency and competitiveness.

56. The National Task Force o n Education, which was appointed b y the Prime Minister
with the mandate to review developments in education over the last 20 years and
prescribe the way forward in addressing inefficiencies and inadequacies, released i t s
report in December 2004. That report recommends: establishment o f performance
indicators; improvements in governance and management o f education systems,
including increased accountability for performance; strengthening o f curriculum,
teaching and learning supports; fuller stakeholder participation in the education system;
and greater equity in the financing o f different types o f schools. O n tertiary education,
the Task Force has recommended decreasing the share o f public expenditure on tertiary
education from i t s current level o f 19.5 percent to 11.8 percent to allow for greater cost
sharing at this level. The Task Force also recommended the immediate appointment o f a
Transformation Team for a period o f three years to lead the restructuring and

19

transformation o f the education sector. The Transformation Team was appointed in midFebruary 2005.

Social Protection

57. Government has made significant progress in reforming the country’s social safety
net. The centerpiece o f the social safety net reform i s the Program for Advancement
through Health and Education (PATH) which involved the merger o f the Poor Relief,
Food Stamp and Public Assistance programs into a unified benefit program, with
significantly lower administrative cost. Another key element o f the reform was better
targeting o f beneficiaries based o n the Beneficiary Identification System (B1S)-an
objective means o f identifying the poor. The Government has reaffirmed i t s commitment
to the social safety net reform program through continued development and
implementation o f a modernized and developmental approach to welfare that emphasizes:
a

a

a
a
a
a

protection o f public non-wage expenditures in selected education, health
and welfare programs to foster human capital development, particularly among
the poor through PATH;
introduction o f the National Assistance A c t as the under-girding o f the
new safety net system and training, upgrading and deployment o f staff to
implement case management approach;
introduction o f cost effective service delivery methods and establishment
o f a Central Welfare Agency;
development and implementation o f a strategy to empower welfare
families to have sustainable livelihoods;
increased program transparency through system wide use o f the
Beneficiary Identification System to identify the poor; and
adjustment o f PATH benefits to J$500 per month by April 2005 and
application o f a benefit review mechanism to minimize erosion o f benefits due to
inflation.

58. The reform i s intended to promote and facilitate social inclusion o f vulnerable
groups particularly poor children, youth, disabled, indigent poor and elderly. This w i l l be
done through integration o f welfare priorities with those o f other social policies and
through empowerment at the community and family level.
59. Proposals for the reform o f the pensions system were developed from as far back as
the 1970s. However, very few o f the recommendations were implemented. In 1994, the
Ministry o f Finance and Planning established a Pension Reform Committee which in
1999 produced a Green Paper “Reform o f the Pensions System in Jamaica” which was
the basis for public discussion. On the basis o f the proposals from the public, the
Government i s developing a National Pensions Act. The National Insurance Scheme (the
Government’s central social insurance program) will be enhanced to provide basic
pension benefits.
Policies for Law and Order and Crime Prevention

60. The Government’s medium-term policy on law and order and crime prevention
focuses on the reduction o f crime and violence and improving the administration, access
20

and delivery o f justice. This w i l l involve improving the capability o f the police and
military and improved surveillance o f coastal waters to prevent smuggling o f drugs and
guns.
61. The government also plans to continue to place emphasis on crime reduction
through the modernization o f the law enforcement infrastructure and b y strengthening
crime prevention efforts with the support o f community-based policing and international
cooperation strategies. The Government also plans to implement the National Juvenile
Justice Plan o f Action focusing on prevention and enhanced processing through the
Courts for those who come in conflict with the law. I t w i l l also seek to improve
rehabilitation and re-socialization, creation o f new opportunities, and reduction o f their
propensity to commit crimes.
Governance

62. Jamaica has a strong democracy, a high caliber bureaucracy and a good regulatory
framework. However, these strengths have not converted into comparable outcomes.
Public satisfaction with government policies and the government’s ability to carry out i t s
declared programs are below average in the cross country comparisons. In addition, the
business environment i s affected by corruption, and very poor rule o f law and crime
negates the positive elements in the business environment (CEM, 2004). Good
governance i s fundamental to the strategic objectives o f the Government. In improving
governance, the Government proposes to focus on two central themes: (i)enhanced
efficiency and effectiveness o f the central and local government machinery, including the
regulatory and legislative environment; and (ii)
greater c i v i l society representation in
national decision making.

63. The Government w i l l continue the local government reform process launched in
1994. The aim i s to create modem local authorities with the capacity, vision and resource
base to deliver the range o f services for which they are responsible, as well as appropriate
mechanisms for accountability and transparency. Closely linked to the creation o f an
effective local government system i s the promotion o f greater involvement o f c i v i l
society in national decision making.
Environmental Sustainability

64. Jamaica’s natural resources play a central role in i t s development. The key
economic sectors o f agriculture, tourism and bauxite mining are all natural resource
based. In addition, many o f the towns and cities need to be protected from flooding
through the proper management o f watersheds. The Government o f Jamaica appreciates
the link between proper management o f the island’s natural resources and sustainable
development. Inappropriate agricultural practices generate a wide range o f negative
impacts including deforestation, soil erosion, pollution, and dwindling marine resources.
O f the estimated 30 percent o f Jamaica covered b y forest, more than 90 percent has been
disturbed and degraded. Widespread squatting in environmentally fragile areas has
increased the cost o f mitigation measures. Inappropriate management o f solid and liquid
waste has resulted in significant damage to the environment including surface and
underground water pollution, clogging o f drains and water courses resulting in flooding
as well as pollution o f beaches, thereby adversely affecting the tourism industry.
21

IV. Progress on the Current Bank Group Strategy
The 2000 CAS and 2002 CAS Progress Report
65. The previous full CAS o f 2000 covering the period 2001-2002 aimed at preventing
a reversal o f the gains in poverty reduction and creating a foundation for economic
growth. I t focused on four pillars: (i)
restoring economic growth; (ii)
ensuring that
growth i s inclusive and that the poor are adequately protected; (iii)improving
governance, efficiency and effectiveness in the public sector; and (iv) ensuring
sustainable development. During FYO1-02, U S 1 9 0 million were committed in new
IBRD lending (Bank Restructuring and Debt Management Program Loan I,Social Safety
Net Project and Jamaica Emergency Recovery Loan). In addition, Jamaica participated
in a regional Adaptable Program Loan (APL) on HIV/AIDS o f US$15 million.
66. The C A S Progress Report (PR) o f 2002 covered a period o f one year and built on
the strategy agreed in the CAS o f 2000. The IBRD lending program under the CAS PR
was US$129.8 million for three projects, two from the previous CAS (Bank Restructuring
and Debt Management Program Loan I1 and Reform o f Secondary Education 11) and a
new National Community Development Project. These three operations were approved
b y the Board in 2003.
67. IFC and MIGA strategies since the 2000 CAS have been to selectively focus on
country specific and regional investments, in order to support Jamaican private sector. In
this context, I F C supported projects in sectors such as power, telecommunications,
infrastructure and retail activities, and participated in the setting-up o f a facility to
provide financing to small and medium-sized export-oriented companies for twelve
Caribbean countries, including Jamaica. MIGA has supported, through guarantees, the
development of the financial sector as well as infrastructure development.

The Existing Portfolio
68. The IBRD existing portfolio in Jamaica consists o f four on-going projects
representing a total commitment o f U S 1 0 9 . 8 million, o f which U S 9 0 . 3 million remain
undisbursed. Approximately 25 percent o f the projects are at risk and 25 percent are
rated as problem projects, primarily due to implementation delays. Three o f the four
projects are in the social sector, focusing on health (HIV/AIDS), education and social
safety net reforms.
The fourth project i s supporting community infrastructure
development. The major project implementation issues relate to: (a) government’s fiscal
constraint as i t relates to the overall funding provisions for projects as well as counterpart
funding; (b) technical capacity within the Project Implementing Units (PIU), particularly
related to financial management and procurement skills; and (c) delays in implementing
the full safety net reform as a result o f holdups in repealing existing Poor Relief
Legislation and enactment o f the replacement National Assistance Act.
69. Due to the tight fiscal constraint and the commitment to reduce the budget deficit to
4.6 percent o f GDP in 2004/05 and to balance i t by 2005/06, the Government has
significantly reduced public investment, including outright cuts or fairly significant
reduction in the f l o w o f fund to multilateral and bilateral programs. One multilateral has
seen a 15 percent cut in i t s portfolio since October 2004. The IJ3RD portfolio has not
22

been affected b y cuts, largely reflecting the higher priority accorded b y the Government
to interventions supported by Bank projects. However, the reduction in project financing
f r o m the Consolidated Fund has affected the implementation progress of all four projects
but particularly the Reform o f Secondary Education (ROSE 11) project due to i t s
significant c i v i l works component, which require fairly large withdrawals from the
Consolidated Fund.
70. In response to the Government’s difficult fiscal situation, the Bank undertook a
review o f the Country Financing Parameters for Jamaica and has approved up to 100
percent financing for new investment projects. In addition, retrofitting o f previously
approved projects may be considered on a case-by-case basis. In this context,
Government, the Bank, and other donors have agreed to move forward on planning for a
Sector Wide Approach (SWAP) in Education that would support critical reforms to
improve system governance and accountability for learning outcomes. The Bank has also
addressed the technical capacity issue related to financial management and procurement
by conducting training for Project Implementing Unit (PIU) staff. This training has also
been combined with the training on Client Connection, which should help to improve
project management.
71. As o f end o f January 2005, IFC committed portfolio amounted to US$114 million,
including US$73 million for IFC’s own account and US$41 million for the account o f
participants. Since FYOO, I F C has disbursed US$139.3 million, notably US$55.8 million
in a telecommunications project (including US$5.8 million for participants’ account) to
promote the rapid expansion o f the mobile phone market in Jamaica; US$38.5 million for
the development o f the Montego Bay Airport (including US$21.4 million for
participants’ accounts); and US$45 million for JPS Co, an independent power producer.
As part o f a US$ 42 million regional investment operation in Central America and the
Caribbean, I F C also supported investment in the retail sector in Jamaica. A large part o f
the portfolio consists o f investments in the utility sector, telecommunications and
transportation and warehousing. In spite o f a difficult macro economic environment, the
quality o f Jamaica’s portfolio improved markedly, reporting no non-performing-loans
(NPLs) since FYOO.
72. MIGA’s outstanding portfolio in Jamaica consists o f 13 contracts o f guarantee with
a gross exposure of US$117.3 million, o f which MIGA’s net exposure i s US$108.1
million. Currently, MIGA i s underwriting two projects in the financial and infrastructure
sectors in Jamaica totaling US$50 million. Both projects are expected to be complete in
FY05. As i t s most prominent operation in Jamaica, MIGA has provided the Bank o f
Nova Scotia (BNS) o f Canada a guarantee o f US$45 m i l l i o n to cover i t s US$50 m i l l i o n
medium- to long-term loan to the Bank o f N o v a Scotia Jamaica Limited (BNSJ) o f
Jamaica. The guarantee i s for up to fifteen years and protects against the risks o f transfer
restriction and expropriation o f funds. The project i s expected to increase the availability
o f l o w cost long-term hard currency funds in both the financial sector and the general
economy. This project w i l l also allow BNSJ to expand the scope o f i t s medium t o long
term hard currency lending to provide funding for projects in the infrastructure, tourism,
port services, wharfage services, water distribution and manufacturing sectors at
preferential rates o f interest.

23

Lessons from the Previous CASs

73. A review o f the lessons learned from previous CASs was summarized in the OED’s
Country Assistance Note (CAN) o f December 1998. In sum, the C A N noted that
adjustment programs did not ensure adequate fiscal adjustment and instead the
Government relied on external borrowing, which resulted in an increase in Jamaica’s
external debt and the Bank’s exposure. On investment lending, the C A N noted that the
ambitious design o f projects was not consistent with local implementation capacity, and
insufficient attention to funding risks and project management were the leading causes o f
l o w success rates. These lessons as well as those gleaned from the 2000 CAS and the
2002 CAS PR and the various project completion reports have been considered in the
framing o f this CAS. Some o f the key lessons learned for the recent lending operations
as well as the 2000 CAS and 2002 CAS PR include:
a
Support focused interventions framed within a sectorkheme comprehensive
approach and coordinated donor assistance. On education, while there has been a
significant increase in access through the Reform o f Secondary Education project,
progress in improving the quality o f education has been more limited. This i s due in part
to the generally poor quality o f students from the early childhood and primary levels
where the Bank had no intervention. Providing support in the context o f a Sector Wide
Approach (SWAp) would help to address the issue o f a focus on the whole; however, the
need for upfront coordination becomes even more important in the context o f a SWAp;

Focus Bank lending in high priority areas which have broad-based support within
the government, parliamentary opposition and c i v i l society and leverage the existing
portfolio o f projects to impact on the unfinished reform agendas in health, education and
social protection. This will not only enhance the ability to leverage support from other
donors but w i l l also help to ensure the political commitment to project implementation.
The lesson i s particularly highlighted in the establishment o f the unified social assistance
program PATH through the Social Safety Net Project, and the success of the Jamaica
Social Investment Fund and the National Community Development Project;
a

Building on existing programs and working through existing institutional
structures to foster sustainable reforms and strengthen Government’s capacity to
efficiently deliver social services;
a

a
Build flexibility into the C A S lending envelope where possible, to allow the Bank
to be responsive to unforeseen crises such as natural disasters or economic shocks b y
ensuring that resources are available for appropriate crisis responses (including repair to
schools, health facilities or other infrastructure and safety nets for households); and

Continue to focus o n simplifying the design o f projects in line with the country’s
capacity for implementation.
a

CAS Consultations and K e y Messages Received
74. The lessons f r o m the previous CASs and project Implementation Completion
Reports confirm one o f the key messages in the 1998 OED’s C A N that in order to ensure

24

V. The Role of the World Bank Group: Looking Ahead
77. The comprehensive Medium-Term Socio-Economic Policy Framework outlined b y

the Government provides a good basis for the Bank Group’s continued support in concert
with other donors. The World Bank Group strategy for FY06-09 is, therefore, aligned
with the government’s Medium-Term Socio-Economic Policy Framework and i s based
on three mutually reinforcing pillars and supported b y two cross-cutting themes o f
Governance and Environmental sustainability.
The three primary pillars are: (i)
accelerating inclusive economic growth; (ii)improving human development and
opportunity; and (iii)
crime prevention and reduction.

The World Bank Group Lending Program
Pillar 1: Accelerating inclusive economic growth

78. The 2000 CAS and subsequent CAS Progress Report focused on restoring
economic growth. Growth has since picked up, but faster and more inclusive growth i s
necessary to launch into a virtuous cycle. This CAS would focus on helping the
government achieving accelerated inclusive economic growth through support for: (i)
fiscal consolidation and debt reduction; (ii)reducing regulatory and infrastructure
constraints and developing the private sector; and (iii)
rural development.
Fiscal consolidation and debt reduction

79. Both the C E M and the PER point to a large debt overhang and fiscal imbalance as

major constraint to faster’growth. The W o r l d Bank Group would support, in partnership
with other donors, the Government’s efforts at fiscal consolidation and debt reduction
through lending as well as through analytical activities in key areas identified below.

80. Aligning the budget to the MTSEPF priorities. Given the very limited fiscal
space, more efficient management o f public resources i s an imperative. The Bank in
partnership with other donors w i l l support the Government’s efforts towards the
establishment o f a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and a related Public
Sector Investment Program (PSIP) that clearly reflects the priorities established in the
MTSEPF. The recently completed Public Expenditure Review (PER) also identified
specific issues which the government needs to address for better alignment o f the budget
with priorities. In order to support the alignment efforts, during the CAS period, the
Bank w i l l work with the government for a wide dissemination o f the PER across
ministries and departments.

81. Continuing public sector reform. With support from the Bank under the Public
Sector Modernization Project (PSMP), the government has completed a first phase o f
public sector reform, including, inter alia the creation o f Executive Agencies which have
been very successful in delivering improved quality service while reducing the fiscal
burden on the government. Presently, there are various pockets o f inefficiency which
lead to waste, and gaps in the system which are conducive to lack o f transparency and
corruption. Addressing these issues may not only help produce value for money and
efficiency savings, but also support private sector development, the achievement o f the
MDGs and a fairer distribution o f the dividends o f development. The Bank, jointly with

26

the IDB and in collaboration with other donors, i s currently undertaking a Country
Fiduciary Assessment (CFA) for Jamaica. I t i s expected that a clear road map w i l l be
presented to the government as to how to improve the efficiency o f public resource use
through improvements in the public financial management and procurement systems.
The Bank will also work with the Government to design a comprehensive capacity
development strategy for procurement and financial management as core functions o f
public administration.

82. Debt reduction. Reducing the debt i s crucial to accelerating growth through less
crowding out o f private investment and through greater public sector investment in
infrastructure. The Government has articulated and i s implementing i t s debt management
strategy which includes running a consistently high primary surplus. The Bank i s
supporting the Government through an ongoing Institutional Development Grant to help
build the capacity o f the debt management unit within the Ministry o f Finance. Over the
CAS period, the Bank w i l l continue to support the Government with technical assistance
o n debt management including ‘on demand’ policy notes. In addition, policy based
lending support o f up to US$75 million during the CAS period could assist the
government in re-profiling i t s debt.
Reducing regulatory and infrastructure constraints and developing the private sector

83. Strengthening of the regulatory framework. In order to improve the regulatory
environment to promote fair competition, encourage private investment as well as
environmental sustainability, the World Bank Group would support the government in i t s
efforts to reform the regulatory environment, first through an assessment of the impact o f
the current regulatory structure, and then recommendations as to the most cost-effective
regulatory policy framework which should be adopted. In this regard, the Bank i s
supporting the Government’s request for financial assistance f r o m the Public Private
Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) for an assessment o f i t s regulatory capacity as a
first step to strengthening the regulatory framework. In addition, through i t s ongoing
dialogue, the Bank would continue to share best practice experience with the
Government.
84. Improving infrastructure. The government has made considerable progress in
encouraging private participation in the provision o f infrastructure including
telecommunications, power and roads. This trend i s expected to continue as the
regulatory framework i s improved. In order to support private sector-led growth in
Jamaica, during the CAS period the I F C and MIGA w i l l continue to support projects in
infrastructure (ports, power, wastewater treatment, transportation, etc. ) and the financial
sector. MIGA w i l l also continue to support the government’s effort to improve
infrastructure through the provision o f guarantees to cover investments in these important
areas.

85. IBRD w i l l continue to provide support for the provision o f infrastructure in
communities through the implementation of the National Community Development
project (NCDP). In addition, during the CAS period, an Inner C i t y Basic Services
Project o f US$25 million will be implemented to provide, among other things, improved
infrastructure in some inner city communities.

27

86. Developing the private sector. Beyond i t s support for infrastructure, I F C w i l l also
bauxite and alumina production; (ii)
seek opportunities to support the expansion of: (i)
services including strong local and /or regional hotel owners/operators; and (iii)
strong
companies wishing to modernize and expand domestically and regionally. In addition,
I F C w i l l seek to provide advisory services to increase the role o f the private sector in the
delivery o f goods and services to the population. Based on the findings o f the FSAP (see
para. l O l ) , I F C could support further consolidation in the banking sector and thus play a
key role in providing, directly or through financial intermediaries, long term finance for
the domestic and regional expansion o f Jamaican companies as well as facilitating access
to finance for SMEs and micro enterprises. I f the intended support for this CAS period
does indeed largely materialize the resulting commitment volume would most likely
exceed that attained during the FY02-05. Finally, I F C could provide technical assistance
on a selective basis, in order to help create an enabling environment and foster supply.
Rural development

87. Jamaica’s rural policy vision i s that o f an economically viable and socially dynamic
rural environment where there i s universal access to social amenities, active participation
o f local communities in decision-making and where opportunities for growth are created
while ensuring sustainable use o f natural resources. The policy has five principal goals:
(i)
promoting growth while protecting the environment; (ii)
providing basic services and
infrastructure; (iii)
building more effective, integrated and participatory processes for
development; (iv) supporting the development of human and social capital; and (v)
eradicating poverty and promoting social inclusion.
88. The Government’s rural growth strategy focuses on increasing access to basic
services, income generating activities outside the agricultural sector and creating an
enabling environment through infrastructure development.
This can be done b y
improving rural roads and irrigation infrastructure, storage, brokering commercial
partnerships between merchants, hotel chains or agro-processors and farmer associations,
contract farming and other contractual relationships that add rural value and increase
competitiveness. Creating linkages between the tourism sector and rural areas i s an
important aspect o f rural development that has not been fully exploited. For example,
rural development could encourage local initiatives in eco-tourism, agro-tourism,
traditional food preparation for hotels in rural areas, heritage tours and plantation visits.

89. Such initiatives could be financed through community driven investments in cooperation with tour operators and hotel chains. In collaboration with other donors
working in the rural area, IBRD would support o n a pilot basis a project for communitydriven development focused on the rural areas (US$15 million). Community-driven
development i s an ideal instrument for participatory implementation o f plans to achieve
the Government’s rural development goals. This was validated by the fact that during the
CAS consultations many people commented that the community driven projects through
the Jamaica Social Investment Fund (JSIF) and NGOs were far more successful and
sustainable than projects directly implemented by the Government with minimal
participation from the community. The implementation o f the development plans
(including the community projects such as small-scale infrastructure or income
generation activities) needs to be done with social, technical, economic, institutional and

28

environmental sustainability in mind. Jamaica and the World Bank have also first-hand
experience in delivering labor intensive infrastructure development to communities
through the National Community Development Project.
The ongoing Poverty
Assessment which also focuses on rural poverty w i l l provide input to the design o f the
rural project.

Pillar 2: Improving human development and opportunity
Transformation of education

90. Early Childhood Development. The Government i s aggressively promoting early
childhood education as part o f i t s strategy to improve education outcomes. This i s in
recognition o f the fact that without early learning, later education i s more costly and less
effective. Experience from other countries suggests that early childhood interventions
(including early childhood care and education programs) can improve education
outcomes and help break the intergenerational transmission o f poverty. Early childhood
interventions can also help to accelerate inclusive economic growth and promote crime
prevention and reduction. The focus on early childhood education, therefore, tackles one
o f the very important dimensions o f the youth-at-risk problem and complements ongoing
Bank support for the Reform o f Secondary Education and the Social Safety Net Reform.
91. The Bank would support the Government’s efforts in strengthening early childhood
development through an Early Childhood Development Project (US$15 million). This
operation would finance and evaluate innovative initiatives for children in the birth to age
3 cohort, including, inter alia, parenting programs, outreach programs for particularly at
risk young children (including l o w birth weight and malnourished babies and babies at
risk o f abuse) and expanded access to day care for children from poor families. These
initiatives would build on lessons learned f r o m international experience and on the
country’s specific program evaluations and would rely on Jamaica’s existing wealth o f
non-governmental organizations already o n the ground delivering services to young
children and parents. The support to early childhood education would also contribute to
improve the quality o f pre-primary (pre-school) education for children in the 4 to 5 age
cohort and strategies to increase pre-primary enrolment among children who are poor.
92. Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) in Education. The government has committed to
implementing a SWAP in education to support the structural reforms t o improve the
education system. I t i s expected that the implementation o f the SWAP could take
upwards o f eighteen months as the government moves to improve i t s fiduciary systems
through the implementation o f an action plan developed through an ongoing joint World
Bank-IDB Country Fiduciary Assessment (CFA). The Bank would also take the lead on
donor coordination for the preparation o f the SWAp. The implementation o f the SWAP
i s expected to bring congruence to the several programs being implemented b y different
donors in the sector, thereby not only reducing the administrative cost but also benefiting
from synergies and improving the overall outcomes.
93. In health, the Bank’s ongoing support will be through the ongoing H I V / A I D S
prevention and control project which i s aimed at assisting the Government in curbing the
spread o f the HIV epidemic through (a) the expansion o f preventive programs; (b) the

29

strengthening o f treatment, care and support for people living with HN/AIDS; and (c)
strengthening o f Jamaica’s multi-sectoral capacity to respond to the epidemic.

Pillar 3: C r i m e prevention and reduction

94. The Bank’s research on crime and violence in Jamaica suggests that i t i s
concentrated in the inner city communities and amongst youth. The Bank’s strategy,
therefore, focuses on these two entry points through the Inner City Basic Services for the
Poor project and the Youth at Risk Project.
95. I n n e r C i t y Basic Services for the Poor. Jamaica’s inner-city communities have
become a flashpoint for the country’s burgeoning crime and violence problem. A
complex relationship has evolved in recent years between organized criminal agents and
inner-city communities. Crime and violence - coupled with growing poverty and
unemployment - have further exacerbated social fragmentation and the weakness o f civic
organization in inner-city comm.unities. A 1997 World Bank study o f Urban Poverty and
Violence concluded that violence in poor urban communities erodes the two key assets
vital to poverty reduction - labor and social capital. The report recommended
interventions that integrate the delivery o f services with building o f civic institutions.
The 2004 World Bank CEM also highlighted the negative impact o f crime and violence
on human and social capital development as well as on the investment climate. The
Government’s Medium-Term Socio-Economic Policy Framework (MTSEPF) l i s t s innercity renewal as a priority.
96. The quality and coverage o f basic services in inner-city communities are poor with
pockets o f extreme deprivation in particular neighborhoods. Access to water, sanitary
facilities, transport, health, public areas and social and sport facilities i s also inadequate
for a majority o f inner-city neighborhoods. Through the Inner City Basic Services
Project (US$25 million), the Bank would provide support to strengthen the provision o f
basic services to the poor including through community based provision. This operation
would also address crime and violence prevention by complementing the community
policing efforts through the improvement o f social infrastructure such as better roads and
street lighting in inner city areas. In this effort, the Bank w i l l maintain close
collaboration with other donors who are involved in complementary operations including
USAID, DFID, IDB, EU and C I D A .
97. Youth At Risk. As the 2004 CEM pointed out, young males in the age group 1424 account for the bulk o f crime and violence. Addressing the youth at risk problem is,
therefore, integral t o crime prevention. One o f the clear messages o f previous Bank
supported analytic work on Youth-At-Risk in Jamaica and the Bank’s Caribbean Youth
Development Study i s that the youth-at-risk problem requires a multidimensional
approach that focuses on both prevention and remediation. The Bank w i l l work closely
with other development partners and with the wealth o f youth serving NGOs in Jamaica
to design an appropriate intervention.

98. The Bank would provide support to the Government’s youth-at-risk initiatives
through a Youth At Risk Project (US$20 million). The operation would support: (i)
a
parenting education program; (ii)
programs to keep students in school; (iii)
activities that
promote the school to work transition; and (iv) targeted interventions for already at-risk

30

youth. The Bank would bring i t s expertise in youth development and build on
international experience o f successful interventions in youth development, building on
existing programs, including inter alia, mentoring programs, after school programs (for
in-school and out-of school youth) and other youth-serving programs. Support for
targeted interventions for youth most at risk could include youth involved in crime and
teenage parents. The Bank would also support development o f better linkages between
different youth serving programs and improving partnership and connectivity such that
the different players would collectively have a larger impact. The Bank would provide
support to implement activities designed to promote the school to work transition. This
support would build upon the partnership established with HEART Trust/NTA in the
completion o f the Lifelong Learning in Jamaica study.

Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAAs)

99. During 2003 and 2004, the Bank prepared a Country Economic Memorandum
focused on issues related to accelerating inclusive economic growth and, during 2004 and
2005, a Public Expenditure Review examining public expenditure allocation priorities
and public sector reform issues in Jamaica’s tight fiscal environment. In addition, a study
on growth and competitiveness issues in the Caribbean recently completed b y the Bank
provides the Government with insights and policy recommendations for improving the
competitiveness o f the economy. The dissemination o f these reports represented a key
instrument for policy discussion with the Government on the country’s development
priorities and the Bank assistance strategy.
100. All AAA covered by this CAS w i l l address issues o f economic growth, human
development and social inclusion, and crime prevention and reduction, and i t w i l l provide
valuable input to the policy dialogue linked with the lending program to accelerate
growth and promote social equity. The AAA will be o f two types: formal and informal.
A brief account o f each study i s provided below. Partnership with other donors,
including the IDB, DFID and EU, in the preparation o f these reports w i l l be sought.
Discussions to this effect are ongoing with some o f the development partners. This w i l l
ensure the Bank avoids duplication, maximizes the use o f available technical and
financial resources, and builds common ground around critical policy issues.
101. A Poverty Assessment currently under preparation w i l l provide an updated
assessment o f poverty levels and w i l l focus o n rural poverty issues, poverty and the labor
market, and the link between crime and violence and poverty. Work on a Country
Fiduciary Assessment (CFA), in collaboration with the Inter-American Development
Bank, i s underway to help strengthen public financial management and procurement. I t
w i l l also help to provide a sound basis for the harmonization and alignment with the
country’s procurement and financial management systems. At the request o f the
Government, the Bank i s undertaking a Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP),
jointly with the IMF, to review the status o f the financial sector. T o help create a positive
enabling environment for private sector driven growth, the Bank i s also undertaking an
Diagnostic o f Investment Climate which w i l l provide policy recommendations
complementary to the recently completed study on growth and competitiveness issues in
the Caribbean.

31

102. The Bank i s supporting the Government’s request for financial assistance from the
Public Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) for an assessment o f i t s
regulatory capacity as a first step to strengthening the regulatory framework.
103. The Bank w i l l continue the informal monitoring o f macroeconomic developments
given the vulnerability o f the economy. This w i l l be done within the context o f the
results based monitoring framework agreed between the Government and the donors. In
addition, the Bank w i l l undertake just-in-time policy notes to follow-up on specific
findings and recommendations o f the studies undertaken during the CAS period and other
issues jointly identified with the authorities. Dissemination o f key analytical work w i l l
be ensured during the CAS period to build wide and strong ownership for further
structural reforms.

104. In addition to the country specific analytical work, Jamaica will benefit from
ongoing and planned regional studies. A Caribbean regional study on Crime, Violence
and Social Exclusion would focus on the impact o f crime on tourism, investment,
poverty, and social cohesion. This would be a multi-sectoral endeavor aimed at
32

developing recommendations that would draw on experience from successful
interventions in Brazil and elsewhere. The Bank i s also currently developing a Social
Protection Strategy Review paper for the Caribbean, including a focus on Jamaica. The
objective o f the strategy i s to strengthen the Bank’s ability to support clients on social
protection through: (i)better understanding the key socio-economic risks, existing
country-level social protection programs, coverage and implementation gaps, and
outstanding country-level needs; (ii)
stronger coordination w i t h country counterparts and
donors; and (iii)
more strategic emphasis on the Bank’s ‘comparative advantage in the
region. A Caribbean regional study on Migration, Remittances and the Diaspora w i l l
examine the impact o f migration and i t s implications for public policy decisions
surrounding the financing o f higher education and skills development; the impact,
facilitation, and potential leverage o f remittance flows; and the potential for the growth o f
niche markets among the diaspora. This work w i l l be undertaken in close collaboration
with other donors, most notably the IDB. Additional planned regional studies cover
issues related to pension reform, health financing, and the infrastructure and financial
sectors (see Table 6).

VI. Program and Risks
Lending Program and Scenarios
105. IBRD’s Lending Scenarios and Instrument Choice. The base-case lending
scenario assumes: (I)
satisfactory portfolio performance as evidenced by no more than 30
percent problem projects; and (2) satisfactory macroeconomic performance as evidenced
b y performance substantially in line with the improving trend in the Government’s
Medium-Term Socio-Economic Policy Framework outlined in Table 4 and monitored
inter alia b y the IMF under Intensified Surveillance. Under this scenario, the Bank
would undertake a modest lending program o f about US$75 million for the period FY0609. The program would consist o f four operations. In FY06, the lending program would
include an inner city basic services project (US$25 million) supporting the government’s
crime prevention and reduction program as well as improving the infrastructure in inner
city areas. In FY07, the lending program would include support to education focused on
early childhood development (US$15 million) in the context o f a Sector Wide Approach
(SWAP) in the education sector. In FY08, the Bank would provide support for an
innovative community driven development project (US$15 million) focused on rural
development. In FY09, the Bank would provide support for a Youth At Risk project
(US$20 million). The base-case lending program i s summarized in Table 7.

106. The base-case scenario described above represents the most likely scenario. Failure
to meet the triggers under the base case would trigger a low-case scenario. In this case,
no new lending would be processed and the Bank would focus on the implementation o f
i t s portfolio and intensify i t s policy dialogue w i t h the government.

33

Table 7. IBRD Lending Scenarios for FY06-09

Development
Policy Lending

107. Under the high-case lending scenario, in addition to the investment lending and
analytical activities planned under the base-case scenario, the Bank could provide policy
based lending o f up to about US$75 million to support a more aggressive debt reduction
program as well as structural reforms, including public sector reforms, in the latter part o f
the CAS period. Debt reduction would free up additional fiscal resources for the social
sectors as well as for public infrastructure investment to further spur growth. Movement
to the high case would require at least an 18-month track-record, within this CAS period,
o f satisfactory macroeconomic performance as evidenced by performance substantially in
line with the improving trend in the Government’s Medium-Term Socio-Economic
Policy Framework outlined in Table 4 and monitored inter alia b y the IMF under
Intensified Surveillance. A continuation in the high-case would require that the
Government maintains this track record o f satisfactory macroeconomic performance. In
the event that Jamaica should obtain an IMF disbursing arrangement, the Bank would
reassess the timing o f i t s policy lending support under this CAS.

108. The policy based lending could support reforms towards fiscal consolidation and
debt reduction with measures both on the revenue and expenditure sides. O n the revenue
side, the focus could be on tax reforms and o n the expenditure side o n public sector
reforms including education sector transformation and the institutionalization o f a
Medium-Term Expenditure Framework as a tool for expenditure consolidation.

Bank Assistance in the Context of Overall Donor Support
109. Overall development assistance has shown a steady decline since 2000, with gross
flows (loans and grants) falling from just above US$400 million in 2000 to US$117.7
million in 2003-a decline o f over 70 percent. This i s due in part to some donors shifting
their strategy to providing more assistance to l o w income countries. The sharp decline in
2003 also reflected the government’s strategy to contain overall expenditure to meet
fiscal targets and decrease reliance on external borrowing for investment projects.
The
emphasis has also been on the slowdown o f the disbursement o f loans and hence the
structure o f the O D A f l o w has skewed towards grants.

110. In terms o f overall resource flows, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB),
the European Union, the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB), the UK Department for
International Development (DFID), the United States Agency for International
Development (US AID) and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA)

Harmonization and Use of Country Systems

111. Despite the decline, Official Development Assistance (ODA) w i l l continue to play a
critical role in financing strategic development projects and programs in Jamaica. The
decline in O D A in the face of the fiscal challenges, however, reinforces the need to
improve aid effectiveness. In this regard, donor harmonization i s an imperative for
Jamaica.

36

112. Since September 2002, Jamaica has been one o f the country pilots for
harmonization. Progress has been made in the four core areas in which the efforts in
Jamaica have been directed: (i)financial management, (ii)procurement, (iii)
environmental safeguards, and (iv) analytical work and strategy.
On financial
management, the Government has accepted the international standard on financial
management and auditing. As a first step, the government i s moving i t s accounting from
a cash basis to an accrual basis and i s already piloting this in three ministries and
departments. The audit system has been strengthened and deepened and a financial
management information system has been developed. The Government also intends to
introduce a common framework for the presentation o f financial reports so that one report
could suffice for all donors participating in the same project.
113. In late 2003, the World Bank undertook a Country Procurement Assessment
Review (CPAR) working with the Procurement Policy Implementation Unit o f the
Ministry o f Finance and Planning (MOFP). Following on the recommendations o f the
CPAR, the government has prepared i t s own procurement guidelines and strengthened
the office o f the Contractor General. Work was undertaken on defining Jamaica’s
National Competitive Bidding (NCB) and International Competitive Bidding (ICB)
thresholds in tandem with the FTAA Market Access. In order to minimize transaction
costs, i t i s felt that the Caribbean Single Market and Economy (CSME) procurement
regime should await agreements reached under the FTAA procurement regime.

114. O n environmental assessment and social safeguards, the preliminary analysis
suggests that harmonization i s possible given the relative similarity between the
environmental assessment system that the Government has put in place and that o f many
o f the donors.
115. While Jamaica has made some progress on i t s financial management, procurement
and environmental safeguards systems, there i s further work to be done in all three areas
in order to move to the use o f country systems. Jamaica’s capacity to carry the
harmonization agenda forwards i s weak in some areas, particularly on overall
coordination and financial management. On overall coordination, DFID i s providing
technical assistance to build capacity within the harmonization secretariat at the Planning
Institute o f Jamaica. The joint BanWIDB CFA, which i s underway, has already provided
some knowledge support for the Auditor General’s Office and i s expected to make a
detailed assessment o f the progress o n the financial management and procurement
systems and make recommendations for their improvement. Part o f the strategic support
under this CAS would be to pilot the use o f the country systems in one or more o f the
investment operations proposed under the base case lending scenario. This would be
done in collaboration with other donors.
116. The joint country strategy consultations w i t h DFID and IDB and in collaboration
with the Government also reflect the significant progress that has been made under the
harmonization initiative to coordinate the work o f the respective institutions and
harmonize the country strategy cycles. The feedback from the government, the
opposition and civil society on the joint consultations was very positive.

Bank Exposure in Jamaica
119. Bank exposure to Jamaica has declined in recent years as a result of lower lending,
in line with the overall reduction in ODA flows. At end-January 2005, Jamaica’s debt to
the Bank was US$435 million, or about one third o f the multilateral debt and 8 percent of
the total external debt. There i s also about US$90 m i l l i o n o f undisbursed commitments
on four ongoing projects. Except for the three year period between 2001 and 2003, net
flows to Jamaica during the period 1990 to 2004 have been negative. N e t flows were
negative US$36 million in FY04.

39

120. The current lending program for Jamaica i s carefully designed to support Jamaica’s
key development priorities within the context o f the country’s overall debt containment
strategy and also minimizing the exposure risk for the Bank. Under the base-case lending
scenario, a very modest lending range o f US$15 million to US$25 million per year i s
planned. Under this scenario, Jamaica’s outstanding and disbursed debt to the Bank
would continue to decline to about US$368 million (about 6 percent of the total external
debt stock) at end 2007. With the DPL o f US$75 million, the outstanding and disbursed
debt to the Bank would increase to US$424 million (6.5 percent o f the total external debt
stock) in 2008 before falling to US$404 million (5.7 percent o f the total external debt
stock) in 2009.

121. With the proposed modest base-case lending, i t i s anticipated that IBRD exposure
would only increase marginally as suggested by the projected indicators in Table 11
below. Debt service to IBRD as a share o f exports o f goods and services i s projected to
remain at 1.1 percent between 2005 and 2006 and then fall to 1.O percent thereafter. Debt
service to IBRD as a proportion o f total external debt service i s expected to rise from 5
percent in 2005 to 6.2 percent in 2006, falling back to 5 percent in 2007 before rising to
7.1 percent in 2009 (assuming the proposed disbursement o f the US$75 million DPL in
2008).

Key Risks and Risk Mitigation
122. K e y risks for the planned program are the country’s vulnerability t o natural
disasters and to extemal economic shocks, domestic shocks, policy slippage or reversal,
notably in the wake o f the 2007 elections, and possible population’s fatigue with the
significant and sustained high level of fiscal adjustment required b y the high debt burden.
The limited fiscal space resulting f r o m the large debt overhang i s also a risk for the
implementation o f this CAS. The CAS program tries to manage these risks through
careful selection o f triggers and monitoring o f progress, continued support for disaster
prevention and mitigation, a focus on priority areas which have strong, broad ownership

40

in the country, and linking fast disbursing lending to policy implementation progress and
results.

123. Natural disasters. Jamaica i s highly vulnerable to natural disasters including
hurricanes, earthquakes and flooding. These events, either occurring together or
separately, can have significant adverse impact on the social and economic life o f the
country. F r o m recent experiences, hurricane and/or flooding can have significant impact
on GDP growth and on domestic inflation as well as necessitate major adjustment in
fiscal expenditure due to re-construction needs. T o mitigate the impact o f natural
disasters, the Bank has assisted the Government with hazard mapping as well as with
reforming i t s Social Safety Net program and through community support through the
Jamaica Social Investment Fund (JSIF). In addition, recent analytical work (PER) has
suggested that the Government should consider the establishment o f a “protected”
contingency fund to be activated in the event o f a natural disaster. The Government of
Jamaica has also expressed a desire to participate in a possible regional risk pooling
arrangement for catastrophe risk insurance. A High Level C A R I C O M Heads o f
Government Meeting in September 2004 formally requested that the Bank undertake a
feasibility for such an initiative and this work i s now ongoing.
124. External Economic shocks. Jamaica i s prone to external shocks arising from o i l
price increases, interest rates increases or indeed any shock to the North American
economy that results in a significant shortfall in tourist arrivals. Such shocks may result
in a deterioration o f the balance o f payments and/or the fiscal account and consequently
the debt dynamics. As pointed out in the recent C E M and PER, the high level o f debt and
the primary fiscal surplus required to service the debt have increased Jamaica’s
vulnerability to shocks. For example, Jamaica could be hard hit if a turning point occurs
in emerging market bonds, driven for example b y higher U S interest rates. Jamaica’s oildependence and i t s already high and increasing rate o f energy-intensity make the country
particularly prone to o i l price shocks. Jamaica i s currently developing an energy strategy
and a review o f the Bank supported Demand Side Management i s currently underway
and should provide some useful lessons on energy efficiency. In the event o f an interest
rate shock, the government may need to increase the level o f primary surplus even
further. The current level o f net international reserves (approximately US$1.8 billion or
4.5 months o f imports) would also provide some cushion for an external shock.
However, in the event o f a significant shock, the Government may have to request
support from the IMF and donors.
125. Domestic shocks. Though infrequent, Jamaica i s subject to domestic shocks from
riots related to lack o f water, police killings or gas price increases. Such events can have
a negative impact on economic performance. While i t i s difficult to mitigate these kinds
o f shocks, the proposed inner-city basic services project and the national community
development project are t w o strategic interventions which in tandem with the other social
capital building activities f r o m other donors can help to ease social tensions.
126. Policy slippage/slow implementation. The Government has demonstrated strong
commitment to reducing fiscal and debt imbalances as indicated by sustaining primary
fiscal balances in excess of 7 percent o f GDP for the last 5 years. This commitment was
recently reaffirmed w i t h the maintenance o f the expenditure program in spite o f the
impact o f the recent Hurricane Ivan. However, with general elections due by 2007 and
41

the M O U signed with the public sector unions expiring in March 2006, there are strong
r i s k s o f policy slippage after March 2006. First, the public sector unions may use the
opportunity created b y a closely contested election to pressure the Government for catchup wages. Second, election induced spending in the year prior to and during the elections
may worsen the fiscal balance and exacerbate the debt situation as was the case for the
2002 elections. The general population’s fatigue with the significant and sustained high
level o f fiscal adjustment may also result in policy slippages prior to the elections.
Attempts w i l l be made to mitigate such risks b y maintaining a close dialogue with the
Government, the opposition and civil society to ensure continued broad-based ownership
of the program. Second, the high-case lending program w i l l only be triggered b y an 18month track record o f satisfactory macroeconomic performance, and with careful
attention paid to i t s timing vis-&vis the forthcoming elections. Third, the results-based
monitoring framework with broad-based support from the donors w i l l act as a very
powerful check against policy slippage/reversal or a slowdown in the implementation o f
the program.

127. Limited Fiscal Space. The investment lending support detailed in this CAS i s
based on the assumption that there w i l l be adequate fiscal space to provide for: (a) voting
of the adequate amount o f resources in the national budget; and (b) the timely
disbursement o f financial resources from the Consolidated Fund to provide for the
effective implementation of the projects to meet their development objectives. However,
a deterioration o f the debt dynamics requiring more resources for interest payments could
compromise the availability o f domestic financing for the priority projects. T o help
mitigate this risk, the implementation o f the projects has been phased and the size o f the
projects have been kept deliberately small.

Annex C
Debt Sustainability

As has been pointed out in the recent Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) and
Public Expenditure Review (PER), the size o f the public debt i s perhaps the biggest
economic challenge which the Government faces in the medium to long term. Even under
the most optimistic scenario, the debt declines only slowly and the debt dynamic i s
subject to probable shocks that could impact key determining parameters including
growth, inflation, exchange rate and interest rates.
The Jamaican authorities have articulated a debt management strategy which aims to
reduce the debt to sustainable levels, and ensure that borrowing costs and risks are
minimized. More specifically, the strategy involves: (a) maintaining a prudent debt
structure; (b) using market mechanisms for domestic debt issuance; (c) promoting and
building a liquid and efficient market for government securities; (d) increasing the
transparency and predictability o f primary market debt issuance; (e) financing the fiscal
deficit and debt redemption; and (0 accessing the external market for funds to the extent
o f gross external amortization. Based on this strategy o f tighter fiscal policy and faster
nominal GDP growth, the authorities expect the public debt-GDP ratio to decline to 136.6
percent o f GDP b y the end o f FY2004/05 and then further to about 100 percent o f GDP
in 2008/09.
Table C1 below, identifies the level o f fiscal effort-in terms o f the primary balancethat would be required to stabilize the stock o f debt over time given the critical
parameters o f growth, interest rates and inflation. For example, assuming a growth rate o f
2 percent, an interest rate of 14 percent and an inflation rate o f 6 percent, a primary
surplus o f 8.1 percent would be required to keep the debt stable. Under the same
assumptions, a much stronger fiscal effort (a higher primary surplus) would be required
to eventually reduce the debt-GDP ratio to the targeted level o f 100 percent o f GDP. With
the debt-GDP reduced to 100 percent, under the same assumptions, the government will
only need a primary surplus o f 5.4 percent to stabilize the debt.

Annex D
CAS Consultations
Background
The preparation o f this CAS resulted from process o f consultation that was intensive and
inclusive. Detailed discussions were held with the Government (including Ministries and
Departments) the opposition, and c i v i l society. Consultations were also held with
bilateral and other multilateral partners. In addition, there were internal brainstorming
within the Bank with participation from all sectors.

Joint Consultations: DFIDDDB and World Bank with Participation by CDB
In January 2005 i t was agreed that in the context o f Harmonization, the Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB), the World Bank (WB) and UK Department for International
Development (DFID) would conduct joint consultations with a cross section o f Jamaicans
as part o f their country planning processes. Strategies and consultations would be based
on priorities outlined in the Government's Medium Term Socio-Economic Policy
Framework (MTSEPF).

The consultations were held in February 14'h , 15Ih and 17tho f 2005 in Mandeville,
Montego-Bay and Kingston, respectively. Invited participants included a cross section o f
c i v i l society including representatives from CBOs, NGOs, the private sector, labor
unions, academia and other International Development Partners (IDPs). Participants were
drawn from the host city and surrounding areas. A total o f one hundred and forty-four
(144) persons participated in the consultations, thirty-five (35) in Mandeville, thirty-three
(33) in Montego-Bay and seventy-six (76) in Kingston.
The format o f the sessions was essentially the same at all the consultations with a
presentation on the Government's MTSEPF, followed b y an open discussion. This was
followed b y the three presentations from DFID, the World Bank and IDB and then a
general discussion on the ideas presented.

Summary of comments
The consultations were successful in facilitating participant input. Persons took full
advantage o f the opportunity to be heard and to put forward their views and suggestions.
Common across all the consultations were the issue areas o f Education and Training,
Governance issues - including the consultative process, local government, public sector
reform, transparency, corruption and accountability. Other common issues were Crime
and Violence, Youth (young males), HIV/AIDS, Agriculture, the Debt, the Disabled
community, Private sector development - including the micro, small and medium
enterprises, Community Tourism and NGO development. Parenting was also raised in all
the sessions as well as Taxation and Employment issues, related both t o private sector
development and macro-economic stability/growth. There was also common concern
regarding the funding and implementation o f the MTSEPF.

Participant Feedback on Consultations

Participants provided written feedback on what they thought of the consultations, a sampling of comments
are presented below:
“Very good opportunity to share views. We hope they contribute to the National good. Stimulated thought.
Gave a chance to hear what the Orgs. are doing”

“(1) Very timely consultation (2) Implementation of suggestions are greatly anticipated (3) Wefeel a part
of the process of development in the nation
“Excellent opportunity to share views. We hope the discussion will be included in the decision making and
that it’s not just talk”
“The move to have the private sector involved in the ‘decision making’ process for the next 3 - 4 years in
the country’s development. We do hope the information is put to great use ”.
“We find the discussion informative & educative & to ...involve everyone. We will be sure to disseminate
the information to our group of 7 communities as soon as we return”
“This was very useful & I am grateful to have been invited to participate. More time may have been needed
to express our opinion on buming issues”
“Very informative, participatory and a good indication of bottom up planning incorporating local and
IDPs”
“Informative, useful, interesting to hear viewpoints of IDB, WB arid DFID )’
“The use of focus group for persons working in specijic areas could be more productive”
“Good opportunity to understand MTSEPF and real voices from difSerent communities. I [willJ take this
discussion back to our ofice (IICA) and MTSEPF will be regarded as a reference when formulating
technical cooperation project”
“This was an excellent consultation. Congratulations are extended for the wide range of invitees and the
clear, comprehensive presentations. There may have been greater gains (my opinion) if more than 15
minutes were dedicated to voices from the floor. Some comments were not received because of time
constraints. I hope an opportunity will arise for the receipt of those comments. Overall, there was a
sensitive, organized approach and an excellently managed consultation. Well done!”
“Overall -presentations impressive, have touched on broad areas of importance. Kindly consider in the
education strategies the possibility of working with parents, parental skills lacking in the country,
education must include parents. Need for more to be said on development of young entrepreneurs”
“...The donor agencies are well placed to have a good overview of our issues. The next step is to link this
macro-viewpoint with effective country projects and programs. This is a critically important process!
