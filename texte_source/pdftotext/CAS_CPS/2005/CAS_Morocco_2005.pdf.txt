EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The goal of this CAS is to help Morocco meet its key development challenges, notably 1)
accelerate employment-generation and sustainable economic growth, and 2) reduce poverty and
marginalization. T o achieve and sustain these goals, a series o f institutional reforms are needed to
improve the transparency, accountability, and inclusiveness o f the public sector. Thus, governance i s a
strong theme underlying the strategy. The Bank i s viewed as a trusted partner and a strong reform
proponent. As such, it can play an important role to assist the government to implement i t s reform agenda.
1.

ii.
This CAS reflects differences from the past. The overarching objective of poverty reduction
and the underpinning objective of governance are both more fully integrated in our country program.
I n addition, the environment for reform has matured. Previous CASs frequently spoke o f “two
Moroccos”--one urban, the other rural. However, recent analytical work-for
example, the first
community-level poverty map-has enabled both government and the Bank to fine-tune their approach.
W e can n o w focus on pockets o f poverty, whether urban or rural. The main difference between this CAS
period (2005-09) and the previous one (2001-04) i s the more favorable political and bureaucratic
environment within which t o implement institutional reforms. A greater sense o f urgency prevails, and
this has generated political will at the top levels o f leadership as well as within civil society. The time i s
right to push reforms forward against both vested interests and bureaucratic inertia.

...

The King has set out a strong new vision for development, placing far more emphasis on
improved social conditions throughout the country. The government has elaborated upon this vision. I t
proposes a program of reforms and investments to generate sustainable growth, energize the labor market,
reduce unemployment, raise the standard o f living, and progressively eliminate poverty and exclusion. A
dynamic and growing civil society i s also playing an important role by, first, helping to define and
implement the country’s social agenda and, second, pushing for better governance. Indeed, the unusual
role of civil society in the region strengthens the irreversibility o f reforms. Despite these positive trends, a
shared global vision for the country’s development i s s t i l l needed for the country to achieve i t s potential.
111.

iv.
Despite progress in recent years, Morocco confronts formidable challenges. These include
lackluster economic growth; vulnerability to variable rainfall; inadequate social indicators relative to the
country’s income level; high unemployment; and increasing pressure o n natural resources, especially
water. Large segments of the population remain socially and economically marginalized. The greatest
challenge (and opportunity) in addressing the weak economic performance o f the past i s to succeed in
employment generation and labor-force growth. If the economy does not accelerate and new jobs do not
materialize during the coming decade, poverty and exclusion are likely t o spark unmanageable social
tensions. By the same token, the much lower rate of population growth (1.5 percent) combined with stillhigh labor-force growth (3 percent) and increasing participation o f women in the labor force could fuel a
decade o f high growth, based on abundant labor supply, a l o w dependency ratio, and high savings.
Whether or not this “demographic dividend” i s received depends crucially on increased private
investment.
The CAS plans to contribute to the broad goals of accelerating sustainable employmentv.
generating growth and reducingpoverty and marginalization. I t will focus upon four objectives:
a. Improve competitiveness and the investment climate. Bank group support will be directed to
achieve five essential outcomes t o improve the Moroccan economy’s competitiveness and thus
i t s j o b creation potential: (1) ensure macroeconomic stability, (2) increase the efficiency o f

..

11

public administration, (3) improve the investment climate, (4) strengthen a growth-oriented
financial sector, (5) increase the competitiveness o f the agriculture sector.
Increase access to basic services by poor and marginalized groups. Bank support will help (1)
reduce slums and improve access to housing for the poorest segments o f the population and (2)
foster greater access to basic services, social programs, and economic opportunity in vulnerable
pockets o f poverty.
Improve the eficiency of the education system. Lending and advisory services will help to (1)
increase access to quality and quantity o f basic education, and (2) improve the graduation and
employment rates in secondary schools, universities, and professional training.
Improve water management and access to water services and sanitation. Three CAS outcomes
have been identified: (1) improve legal, financial, and institutional frameworks for the water
sector; (2) improve access and treatment coverage in targeted river basins; and (3) improve
financial and operating performance among water sector operators.

vi.
Achieving results in intermediate and larger strategic objectives will require improved
governance. Specifically, the essential building blocks o f good governance-transparency,
accountability, and inclusiveness-will guide h o w Bank interventions are designed. Focusing o n these
three elements in budget reform work, for example, should improve efficiency in the f l o w o f public
expenditures, a necessary requirement for implementing the government’s priority investment projects.
Further, by focusing on inclusiveness, poverty and gender concerns can be integrated across the program.

vii.
The instruments of the strategy will move toward greater use of programmatic approaches.
While maintaining flexibility in the precise mix o f instruments and sectoral allocations, the CAS
anticipates relatively greater emphasis on a programmatic approach t o lending and to economic and sector
work (ESW) to enable the most effective backing o f the government and i t s reform program. Analytical
work will continue to drive the strategy, since experience with programmatic E S W (PESW) has
repeatedly demonstrated that strong analytic w o r k can lead to sound lending. Investment lending will
increasingly take the form o f sector-wide approaches to lending (generally referred to as SWAPS). IFC
will (1) focus on the financial sector, through technical assistance and investment, with a particular
emphasis on SMEs, microfinance and housing, (2) support efforts for corporate governance, and (3) seek
advisory and investment opportunities in the infrastructure sector, including financing large or complex
transactions.
viii.
For FY2006-09, a flexible program of $250 to $350 million a year is planned to support the
strategic CAS objectives. Morocco has diversified sources o f external financing, and the level o f Bank
lending does not represent traditionally conceived “leverage” for accelerated refoms. Appropriate
flexibility i s in place to respond to high-quality lending opportunities and to support growth and related
reforms. The planned amount o f lending i s consistent with sound risk management in view o f Morocco’s
recent progress, base-case projections (Annex 9), the outcome indicators set in this C A S (Annex 2), and
the evolution o f IBRD exposure indicators. Reduced IBRD lending would be triggered by a failure t o
maintain a stable macroeconomic framework, in particular a failure o f Morocco to move in the direction
o f a sustainable fiscal deficit.

ix.
The program is designed to mitigate risks that could affect the effectiveness of Bank support
and to enhance monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of CAS outcomes. Over the four coming years, the
Bank program faces a series o f risks. These include the government’s continuing willingness to address
the country’s economic and social challenges, hesitant decision-making processes, and the possibility that
the Bank financing will become less important to meeting the needs o f this middle-income country

...

111

(MIC). The Bank will mitigate these risks in several ways. W e will undertake more systematic political
economy analysis, and we will improve our ability to support reforms through informed outreach to
important stakeholders. We will offer high-quality, timely analytical work and technical advice, as well as
an intelligent mix o f lending instruments. The Bank also needs to build upon synergies with Morocco’s
other development partners-most notably, greater complementarity with the European Union.

Thefollowing issues are suggestedfor Board discussion:

Does the C A S adequately reflect the recommendations o f the M I C report? Does it provide for
sufficient flexibility and responsiveness?
I s the lending scenario appropriate? Does i t support the strategy with sufficient flexibility to deal with
unanticipated developments?
Does the C A S adequately address the issue of institutional reform and governance?
Are the macroeconomic challenges and their potential repercussions o n the CAS fully addressed?

MOROCCO: COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY FY2006-09

I.COUNTRY CONTEXT
A. Political and Social Context

1.
Morocco stands out in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region for its political
opening. This trend began in the mid-1990s under former King Hassan 11, and i t has accelerated since his
son, King Mohammed VI, acceded to the throne in 1999. The broad political changes in Morocco have
been manifested in free and fair elections and a flourishing c i v i l society. Thousands o f development and
advocacy NGOs are active today, and a dynamic press corps i s at work. A recent reform o f the family
law-the Moudawana-greatly advances the rights o f women and encourages a more inclusive society.
2.
This political opening is particularly notable in light of security concerns that are common
elsewhere in the region. Several terrorist attacks in Casablanca shook the country o n M a y 16, 2003.
Many people were killed, including suicide bombers who were home-grown Islamic radicals living in the
city slums. In response to these attacks, security was tightened and efforts were strengthened to improve
social conditions in the urban, peri-urban, and rural areas. Poverty, exclusion, and misery are viewed
widely as fertile breeding grounds for extremists. The King has guided the country along a sensitive path
toward widespread political participation while ensuring security and stability.
3.
Morocco ’s constitution envisions a political system that involves decision making by
democratically elected officials with the guidance of the monarchy. Following the legislative elections
of September 2002, the King nominated a technocratic prime minister t o lead a coalition government
representing the political parties’ respective weight in Parliament. Despite great gains in the popular vote,
the Islamist Justice and Development Party (PJD) did not participate in the government.

4.
Given this political evolution, government decision making ofen appears complex.
Complicated political bargains are typical o f coalition governments. In recent months, the King has tried
to address this by promoting a new l a w to reduce the number o f political parties and counter
fragmentation. Nevertheless, complex decision making may be inevitable in a country with the unique
characteristics o f Morocco, namely a democracy in transition and a King actively pursuing an ambitious
economic and social agenda. There may be certain up sides, such as limits to the extent to which the
country can move “off track”; however, the down side i s that lines o f authority and accountability will
continue to be unclear. T h i s ambiguity will make it more difficult to formulate a shared vision and to
implement a program for the country’s economic and social development. The lack o f a clear economic
vision will discourage domestic and foreign private investors and as a result, badly needed economic
growth and employment generation may suffer.
5.
Since his accession to the throne, King Mohammed V I has favored Morocco’s focus on poverty
eradication and social development. Subsequently, the government has made poverty reduction one o f i t s
top priorities. At present, about 15 percent o f the population i s considered t o be poor. Roughly two thirds
of the poor live in rural areas, though the share in urban areas i s rising. Recent analytical work by the
W o r l d Bank and the government o f Morocco reveals considerable heterogeneity in poverty levels among
communes (even within the same province and region) and that pockets o f poverty are common in both
urban and rural areas. In addition to those falling below the poverty line, about a quarter o f the population
i s considered to be “economically vulnerable.” These people are living at or below 50 percent above the
poverty line and are thus ill prepared to weather shocks such as family illness, drought, or job loss. This
group poses a considerable challenge to social stability. Typically, they struggle to get by, frustrated by
inequality. The very poor necessarily remain more focused o n the continuous daily challenge o f meeting

2
basic needs. Together, the “poor” and “vulnerable” comprise about 40 percent o f the Moroccan
population who need greater opportunities to participate in growth as well as access to basic services.

6.
The importance of growth for poverty reduction became evident during the 1990s, when income
poverty rose by about half-from
13 to 19percent of the population. The 1990s was a period o f slow
growth during w h i c h real household consumption shrank, unemployment grew, and rural households
encountered .years o f drought. While some deterioration in income distribution contributed t o the increase
in poverty, approximately 85 percent was directly attributable to the very weak growth.’ During the recent
years o f strong growth, poverty has declined rapidly, including in rural areas.
7.
Social indicators, particularly for girls and women, have improved significantly because of the
country’s ambitious literacy, education, and rural developmentprograms2; however, they are still low if
compared with other countries at similar income levels. Although achievements are impressive in the
area o f human development, there i s s t i l l a long road ahead before Morocco reaches countries at similar
income levels and meets i t s Millennium Development Goals.3

8.
Despite improvements in private per capita consumption, poverty, and social indicators, urban
unemployment has continued to climb. The increase in urban unemployment has l e d to greater
exclusion. The increase i s disproportionately high among the young and educated, whose rates o f
unemployment are 34 percent and 26 percent respectively. The active urban population i s growing by 4
percent a year, mainly because o f rural migration. The key to improving social conditions i s concerted
effort toward better living standards in both rural and urban areas.
B. Recent Economic Developments

9.
Over the past decade, Morocco has consolidated its price stability, strengthened its external
position, and initiated an ambitious program of structural reforms. Inflation remains low, and the
external position i s at a comfortable level. The economy has been strengthened by high and steady inflow
of remittances, tourism receipts, and foreign direct investment. Structural changes are under way in many
areas, including trade facilitation, customs reform, financial sector liberalization, telecom privatization,
agricultural modernization, and public sector modernization. The principal concerns over the medium
term are l o w growth, employment, and fiscal sustainability. Growth in Morocco i s variable and highly
weather dependent. On average, i t has been too l o w per capita to generate the jobs that are needed to
absorb the unemployed labor force. In 2000-200 1, the fiscal stance deteriorated because o f declining
revenues and higher expenditures, financed by privatization proceeds. Public debt ratios are s t i l l high but
declining. Acceleration o f growth will require a renewed sense o f urgency. Fiscal imbalances need to be
corrected and then stabilized in order to complete an agenda o f structural reforms that will increase
Moroccan business competitiveness at home and abroad. Reforms leading t o a lower fiscal deficit would
increase investor confidence, sparking the growth that i s necessary to address Morocco’s poverty and
social pressure.
I O . Morocco has implemented successful stabilization programs since the mid-l990s, and it has
achieved low inflation through prudent macroeconomic management. Strong stabilization efforts were
needed to correct fiscal imbalances and reestablish credibility following the debt rescheduling agreements
of the late 1980s. Inflation rates declined from double digits in the 1980s to less than 2 percent in the
present decade. Prudent monetary policy supported a regime o f fixed exchange rates. The currency basket

For example, net primary school enrollment rose form 58 percent in 1990 to 92 percent in 2003. Life expectancyrose from 67

underlying the exchange rate was modified in 2001, implying a de facto devaluation o f 5 percent o f the
dirham, Remittances, tourism receipts, and foreign direct investment linked to privatization led to
substantial banking liquidity and greater international reserves. The reserve position has more than
doubled from 4.6 months o f imports in 2000 to 12 months o f imports in 2004. Remittances have also
contributed to increased national savings and successive current account surpluses since 2001.
Remittances represented 8.2 percent o f GDP and tourism receipts 7.4 percent o f GDP in 2003. These
outcomes are particularly noteworthy because they were achieved in an adverse external environment that
included an economic slowdown in the international economy, high o i l prices, and pervasive geopolitical
uncertainty.

11. Despite achievements, the fiscal
Figure 1: Central Government Budget deficit in YOof GDP
position has slipped and is unsustainable
(excluding privatization receipts and including Hassan I1 Fund spending)
in the medium term. The large budget
deficit4 averaged 5.2 percent o f GDP in
2001-04 (Figure 1). These deficits were
4%
financed by substantial proceeds from

privatization and domestic borrowing.

Large budget deficits came about mainly
in response to the rising wage bill,

representing about 13 percent o f GDP in

infrastructure investment, financed by the
Hassan I1 Fund; and weaker revenue
performance o n account o f selected
import tariff reductions. In addition,
important transfers were made to the
pension system and to two ailing public banks. Fiscal deficits o f this magnitude are unsustainable over the
medium term. In 2004, more than h a l f o f the financing o f the fiscal deficit originated f r o m privatization
proceeds that are projected to phase out rapidly in 2006, making fiscal adjustment a top priority in 200506. T o preserve stability over the medium term, rapid and decisive action to increase revenue i s needed o n
several fronts, as w e l l as efforts t o tackle budget rigidities, reverse expansionary payroll spending, and
address actual and contingent fiscal liabilities. This would also create sufficient fiscal space to cover
investments in development priorities. A Bank-supported public-sector reform program i s under way to
help curb rising expenditures (notably through c i v i l service reform and budget reform) and to address
declining revenue trends (through tax reform planned for 2006), and thus avoid the possibility that public
debt will climb toward unsustainable levels.
12. Active debt management has helped reduce debt and boost investor confidence. Total external
government debt has steadily decreased from 34 percent o f GDP in 2000 t o an estimated 16 percent in
2004 (Figure 2). By contrast, domestic debt has risen from 42 percent to 5 1 percent o f GDP over the same
period. Overall (and despite large fiscal deficits), Morocco reduced i t s total public debt f r o m 76 percent of
GDP in 2000 to 67 percent o f GDP in 2004. As discussed below, the market view o f the Moroccan
economy has improved considerably in response to the combination o f sound debt management, l o w
inflation, the solid external reserve position, and an ongoing program o f structural reforms. In July 2003,

The term “budget deficit,” as used here and throughout the CAS does not include privatization receipts and grants. I t includes
expenditure of the Hassan I1Fund. Further references to the “budget deficit” follow that definition throughout this paper.

uidertaken include trade liberalization, financial sector strengthening and privatization, fiscal and
customs reform, and more recently, governance reform. Trade liberalization led to an Association
Agreement signed with the European U n i o n in 1996 and implemented in M a r c h 2000. An FTA was also
concluded with the United States in M a r c h 2004. Prudential regulation and supervision o f the financial
system was strengthened through the approval o f new banking, and Central Bank laws. Restructuring of
two troubled state-banks i s ongoing. Privatization o f the state-owned telecom companies i s n o w complete.
Awarding o f a second mobile phone license has produced substantial economic and financial benefits,
triggering a major reduction o f communication prices and thousands o f n e w jobs. M o r e recently, the
government has taken several other important steps: issuing new public procurement regulations,
initiating judiciary reform through the creation o f commercial courts, passing new laws o n competition
policy, establishing a competition council, and liberalizing prices. Structural reform has provided a strong
foundation upon which to jump-start growth-in
particular, reducing dependence o n agricultural
production. Further work i s needed to build o n these foundations and to fully implement and complete the
full agenda o f required reforms.
14. Savings and investment rates
have risen for several reasons.
These include the implementation o f
sound stabilization programs, ongoing
structural reforms (especially in trade,
the financial sector, and privatization),
and record remittances from the large
population o f Moroccans working
abroad. In the 1980s, the distorted
macroeconomic
environment
constrained private sector development,
resulting in l o w investment and savings
levels. However, reforms in the mid-tolate 1990s changed this picture. The
national savings rate rose from 18
percent in 1995 to 26 percent in 2004,
and investment rates from 20

16. Because growth has been relatively modest, new entrants into the labor force-especially youth
and women-are jinding few jobs. Unless efforts are taken to accelerate the competitive position of
Moroccan business, international competition will further undercut employment creation. In recent years,
high unemployment has been exacerbated because j o b creation cannot keep up with the large number of
women and young people who are entering the workforce. The urban unemployment rate peaked at 23
percent in 1995, and declined to 18 percent in 2002 with stimulus f r o m the dynamic manufacturing sector.
However, as more women entered the workforce and registered their w o r k status, the unemployment rate

6
went back up 20 percent in 2003. Unemployment i s particularly h i g h - o v e r 34 percent-among
young and educated.

18. Any successful growth strategy requires price stability and reforms that support a dynamic
private sector. T o attract investment, competitiveness o f the business environment must be strengthened.
This entails both macro- and microeconomic reforms. F o r a stable macroeconomic environment, a
sustainable budget deficit and a competitive exchange rate are essential. T o assess needs on the micro
side, firm-level surveys were recently completed jointly by the Bank and the Moroccan government. The
surveys demonstrate that businesses, particularly employment-generating small and medium enterprises,
require (i)
a financial system that provides adequate capital t o small as w e l l as medium and larger firms;
(ii)a qualified and trained labor force, with effective implementation o f the n e w labor code; (iii)a
functioning and fair land market; and (iv) a legal system that enforces property rights and contracts and
resolves disputes. These key elements lower the entry barriers for new firms, particularly small and
medium enterprises. A more competitive business environment encourages investment, ultimately
creating more jobs.

The dirham remains pegged to a publicly undisclosed basket in which the euro has a large weight. Movements in the real
exchange rate have been modest, with a gradual depreciation over the past few years.

This excludes agriculture products.

11. KEY CHALLENGES AND MEDIUM-TERM PROSPECTS
A.

Country Vision, Government Program, and Outstanding Challenges

19. The King has set out a socially oriented vision for the country’s development. I t emphasizes
improvement in social conditions far more than has been previously articulated. The King has repeatedly
reiterated the need for strong growth and employment generation, education, low-income housing,
responsive local decision malung, and women’s rights.
20. The government has elaborated upon this vision by proposing a program of reforms and
investments. As outlined by the prime minister in a speech to Parliament, the program aims “to generate
sustainable growth capable o f energizing the labor market, reducing unemployment, raising the standard
of living o f citizens, and progressively eliminating poverty and exclusion.’” Following upon the
November 2002 elections, it proposes to strengthen private sector potential by improving the
competitiveness o f Moroccan enterprises. Measures to do so include maintenance o f an appropriate
macroeconomic framework, investment in infrastructure, and restructuring the national education and
training system. The social agenda includes a major focus o n improving income and access to and quality
of services for the poor and marginalized (pditique de proximite?. I t focuses o n housing, transport, health,
and rural development. Public administration reform, which improves the efficiency and effectiveness o f
the budget and c i v i l service, i s recognized as a key element to the success o f the agenda. Management o f
water resources i s another key component o f the govemment program.
21. Slow economic growth, weak social indicators, high unemployment, and growing pressure on
natural resources (in particular, water) pose major challenges. On the other hand, Morocco’s
demography poses an opportunity. The population growth rate i s only 1.5 percent; the workforce i s
growing at a strong 3 percent; and the rate at which women are joining the labor force i s accelerating. An
abundant workforce and l o w dependency rates are positive factors. I f combined with strong education and
training measures to integrate more young people into the economy, rising growth could be sustained.
However, if growth and j o b creation over the coming decade do not accelerate significantly faster than the
rates o f the past decade, poverty and exclusion could reach levels that incite unmanageable social tension.

(0
Creating job-generating growth through an improved competitiveness and investment
climate. Creating jobs for Morocco’s young and growing labor force will require acceleration o f
employment-generating economic growth. Maintaining overall macroeconomic equilibrium i s a
clear priority, but equilibrium alone will not provide sufficient push t o drive the economy to i t s
full growth potential. Morocco has recently tried expansionary budget policies in efforts to preselect and encourage certain high growth sectors. By in large, these efforts have failed to produce
sustainable growth. A competitive private sector requires an environment that i s open and free,
and offers all f i r m s a level playing field. The recent Investment Climate Assessment led by the
Bank and I F C reported that private sector development-particularly for small and medium
enterprises-is
constrained by lack o f access t o capital and by problems related to public
administration and justice. In addition, enterprises are hampered by a land market that lacks
transparency. The “unleveled” playing field favors the large, established, well-known Moroccan
firms.g Improving these factors to facilitate investment poses a critical challenge that Morocco
must meet.

business environment.

(ii)
Improving the living standards for the poor and marginalized. In addition to dynamic
growth, t h i s requires special efforts to provide access to services and opportunities that the poor
and marginalized have been denied in the past. Over the past several years, Morocco has greatly
improved basic rural services for water, sanitation, roads, health care, and education. This needs
t o continue, and expand to both the rural and urban poor and to marginalized areas. Though
economic growth remains the underlying key for reducing poverty in Morocco, pro-growth
policies are not necessarily distribution-neutral. As tools are developed t o assess the relative
winners and losers from economy-wide policies, decision malung can be finely tuned. Positive
impact can be maximized for poorer segments o f society, with social protection expanded for
those who are most vulnerable during periods o f transition.”
(iii)
Strengthening education. During the past decade, Morocco made great strides in
improving access to basic education. The national net enrollment rate for primary education rose
from 52.4 percent (1990-9 1) to 92.0 percent (2003-04). Meanwhile net enrollment rates rose
f r o m 17.5 t o 32.0 percent in middle school, and from 6.1 to 14.9 percent in upper-secondary
education. Future development o f the Moroccan formal education system, however, will face
many n e w challenges. Internal inefficiency i s high, as evidenced by high dropout and repetition
rates, gender and geographical disparities at a l l educational levels, and an unsatisfied demand for
middle school entry as a consequence o f successful increases in access to primary education.
Illiteracy i s an especially severe problem. At 6.6 percent o f GDP, the education sector has already
been allocated substantial funding. The financial margin to expand the system i s limited, In this
context, the government needs to manage a complex educational system and meet increasingly
diverse demands while i t simultaneously implements large-scale education reform. A Strategic
Framework for the Development o f the Education Sector (Cadre Strattgique de DCveloppement
du Systkme Educatif) was elaborated with technical assistance f r o m the Canadian International
Development Agency (CIDA), outlining strategc plans to operationalize the Education Charter
over the next five years (2005-09). The framework aims to enhance the quality, relevancy, and
cost effectiveness o f the education system. The key challenge will be to improve access to quality
education, which i s essential for building a skilled labor force capable o f competing effectively in
the global economy.
(iv)
Sustainable and efficient use of water resources. Water i s a scarce strategic resource in
Morocco. Since the 1960s, the country’s hydraulic infrastructure has been developed successfully
in order to secure sufficient water for urban use as w e l l as irrigation water needed for agriculture
and economic development. Unfortunately, these priorities were not coupled adequately with
concern for demand management, resource protection, and rural water supply. This l e d to
inefficient utilization, depleting and degrading water resources and creating one o f the most
severe rural supply deficits in the Middle East and N o r t h Africa region. A new Water L a w
introduced river basin agencies in order to implement integrated water resource management and
to encourage conservation and resource protection. Ambitious goals were set to improve
efficiency and expand infrastructure among operators in the sector. Particular emphasis was
placed o n pollution control. Nevertheless, institutional and financial constraints have delayed the
implementation o f these reforms. Experience shows that the institutional and financial dimensions
generally featured more mixed results while the infrastructure components o f reforms were
completed in a satisfactory manner. Morocco faces a crucial challenge in i t s need to address the
institutional bottlenecks that cause less- than-satisfactory governance and financial management
in the water sector.

Policy by Identifying the Geographic Dimension o f Poverty,” September 2004.

B. Medium-Term Outlook

22. Morocco has an opportunity to accelerate growth, increase employment, and reduce poverty. T o
do so, it needs to build on i t s present macroeconomic foundation o f l o w inflation and a solid extemal
position. It needs t o continue i t s multi-pronged structural reform agenda, focusing o n fiscal imbalances,
continuing trade liberalization, and opening up o f the economy. It needs to expand the role and enhance
the efficiency o f the private sector, addressing weaknesses in the financial sector and the pension regime,
and freeing the labor market. The exchange rate regime may also need to be adapted t o the changing
context, with a view toward further trade liberalization in the prospect o f eventual capital account
opening. Exchange rate policy would thus be converted into an instrument that improves competitiveness
and supports growth.

23. The Base Case scenario assumes a stable macroeconomic framework under modest growth and
partial adjustment. This i s supported by partial recovery o f medium-term fiscal sustainability, slightly
higher national savings ratios, and sustained export performance resulting from constant real exchange
rate and terms o f trade. If coupled with the continued sizable remittances and tourism receipts, a declining
but positive current account surplus should be preserved, and the extemal position would remain sound.
24. Under the Base Case scenario, growth would not accelerate beyond the recent average of the past
10 years, that is, 4 percent; however, fiscal sustainability would be partly restored. In this scenario,
partial efforts are made for fiscal consolidation but structural reforms are implemented at a slower pace.
Hence, in the aftermath o f a slight slowdown for 2005-because o f projected rainfall lower than the
exceptional level during 2004-the growth rate would remain at a 4 percent average until 2009. Inflation
would remain subdued at 2.5 percent. Monetary policy would be expected to remain prudent in order to
cope with large though declining private capital inflows related to the rapid phasing-out o f proceeds from
privatization. This scenario projects two main outcomes. On the domestic balances, a partial correction o f
the budgetary situation would mean a fiscal deficit reaching 3.6 percent o f GDP by 2009. W h i l e this
would imply a significant reduction, i t will s t i l l remain higher than the 3 percent level that Moroccan
authorities have targeted. Partial but sustained reforms o n the revenue and expenditure side would be
implemented to bring about this outcome. Revenue measures to broaden the tax base and simplify and
strengthen administration o f the tax system would be accompanied by expenditure measures regaining
control o f the wage bill and tightening other current spending. The gradual implementation o f the public
administration reform program, supported by the Bank, would target a reduction o f the wage bill f r o m 13
percent o f GDP to 11 percent, but only h a l f o f this goal would be accomplished. Rapidly declining
privatization proceeds would also continue to partly finance the fiscal deficit in 2005. I t would then phase
out, making moderate capital expenditure cuts inevitable. On the extemal balances, the surplus o f the
current account would gradually decline since an enhanced exports performance will not offset a recovery
of rising domestic demand for imports (also fueled by steady workers’ remittances). This outcome would
also reflect the effects on Morocco’s textile exports o f MFA expiration in 2005. Following a temporary
surge o f public debt in 2005 related to one-time recognition o f past arrears to the social security system,
the public debt ratio would continue to decline t o 66 percent o f GDP by the end o f 2009. Under this
scenario, urban unemployment would be preserved at i t s present level because o f the relatively high labor
force growth coupled with modest economic growth.
25. Declining external financing gap would be filled mainly by multilateral financing and foreign
direct investment. Under the base case, the aggregate financing gap would be about US$15 billion during
2005-08, roughly the same amount considered for the previous C A S period. This decrease in financing
needs corresponds to the lower amounts involved in the amortization profile and current account
surpluses, and lower needs for reserve gains by Bank A1 Maghrib. Multilateral financing and foreign

10
direct investment will play an increased role in filling the gap, as privatization proceeds and bilateral
financing phases out.

26. Under an alternative High-Case Scenario not only would fiscal sustainability be fully restored,
but growth would be stronger than in the past decade averaging 5 percent. This increase would be
mainly driven by a combination o f a dynamic export performance resulting f r o m sustained EU and U.S.
demand and by higher domestic and foreign private investment. Rapid growth would benefit from solid
implementation o f structural reforms-in particular, from rapid reconversion o f manufacturing t o new
export opportunities, adequate implementation o f the fi-ee-trade agreement, dynamic tourism and
construction sectors, some recovery in agriculture because o f good weather and the acceleration o f
manufacturing to new export opportunities, adequate implementation o f the free-trade agreement,
dynamic tourism and construction sectors, some recovery in agriculture because o f good weather and the
acceleration of agricultural modernization, and reforms to the financial sector to reduce financing costs
and improve access to financing by small and medium enterprises. Following its rising trend since 1998,
private investment would continue to serve as the growth engine. Higher growth would also benefit from
a stronger fiscal adjustment effort leading to more-sustainable fiscal and debt ratios, higher surpluses in
the external current account, and lower perceived country risks by international capital markets. Under
this scenario, urban unemployment would decline.

27.
Under a Low-Case Scenario, growth would be mediocre and the lack of significant fiscal
adjustment would not immediately threaten fiscal stability; however, once privatization proceeds are
phased out after 2006, growth could get severely compromised by the end of the CASperiod. Growth i s
assumed to be a l o w average o f 3 percent if domestic shocks-for example, droughts, external shocks, or

11
a deterioration of the manufacturing industry’s competitiveness more severe than projected-combine
with lack of fiscal discipline. T o the extent that privatization proceeds would generate a fiscal stimulus

and temporarily finance high fiscal deficits, growth would remain positive, though lower than the BaseCase Scenario. However, once these proceeds are phased out and budgetary imbalances require more
domestic borrowing, private investment would be crowded out. Growth would further decelerate because
of the rising interest rates. Fiscal instability would also constrain private creditors and foreign direct
investment. Under this scenario, urban unemployment would increase even further.

111. MOROCCO-WORLD BANK GROUP PARTNERSHIP, FY2006-09
A.

Past Bank Assistance

The CAS Completion Report assesses the implementation of the 2001 CAS as moderately
satisfactory. The proposed CAS program was highly relevant t o Morocco’s needs, and i t aligned with the

28.

five-year plan o f 2000. Implementation, however, was less satisfactory. The C A S program was overly
complex and not sufficiently selective. It contained 17 outcome areas, with too many activities and
consequent task fragmentation. Many Analytic and Advisory Activity (AAA) tasks were added. This may
have demonstrated Bank responsiveness to demand, but it lacked coherence and may have avoided some
strategic tradeoffs. The lending program was much reduced to less than had been planned. O f the 18
projects planned, only 9 were delivered as investment or adjustment loans. Although the C A S had
intended to step up Learning and Innovation Loans (LILs), they did not materialize. Only one LIL was
delivered; but this was probably just as well, since the instrument has been shown to be costly to process,
and the learning objectives can also be attained through traditional investment loans. Overall, the volume
of lending was about h a l f o f what had been expected.

29. Results were achieved partially or completely for 14 of the 17 CAS outcomes. As a note o f
caution, this assessment i s not entirely rigorous because the C A S did not specifically spell out and link
the outcomes to measurable indicators. However, many results were noteworthy. These include
substantial development o f rural infrastructure; modernization o f public administration and significant
improvements in public budgeting; improvements in water management; sustained dialogue on education
and implementation o f the education charter; and better understanding o f the characteristics o f poverty,
which enhanced capacity for pro-poor programs. The results are likely t o be sustainable, but their impact
on institutional development i s modest. The C A S period was characterized by excellent dialogue between

,

12

the Bank and the government o f Morocco, including at the highest level. The Bank also expanded i t s
dialogue with stake-holders outside o f government. The Bank presence in Rabat was a key to the success
in promoting this dialogue.

30. The quality of the portfolio was moderately satisfactory during the previous CAS period. Quality
Assurance Group (QAG) ratings for quality at entry and supervision were satisfactory overall; however,
several weaknesses were evident in the portfolio. “Problem projects” accounted for nearly 20 percent o f
the portfolio during most o f the period, although proactivity and realism remained high. The disbursement
ratio dipped from a 15 percent average in the three previous years to 10 percent in 2004. The portfolio
was characterized by significant delays in implementation. More than h a l f the projects to be closed during
the C A S period were extended for 12 to 36 months. Effectiveness was delayed-1 1 months on average
after Board approval. Project preparation costs were high, about two-and-a-half times the Bank average.
In part, this i s related to the small size of most o f these loans and to the large number o f projects that were
dropped-that is, 20 projects, which added up to $2 million in dropped-project costs during FY200 1-04,
equivalent to more than a third o f total project preparation costs. There i s a high level o f net disconnect
between project ratings at their completion and their final ratings by the Operations Evaluation
Department (OED),” suggesting that project teams may have been less than sufficiently candid in
evaluating their project outcomes. Borrower performance was satisfactory. Explanations for problems
encountered include insufficient preparation o f projects at entry, overly ambitious assessment o f the
capacity o f implementing agencies, and reduced demand for Bank financing in light o f concessional
sources o f funding.

31. QAG reviewed the AAA program during the past CASperiod, concluding that the program was
satisfactory overall. The program was rated satisfactory on strategx relevance (clear objectives and good
alignment with CAS), internal quality (good analytic quality), coherence and integration (very good
integration o f AAA with lending, but moderate coherence among AAA tasks across sectors and over
time), and likely impact (meaningful changes in government policies, good ownership for reforms, and
effective knowledge transfers). The program was rated marginally satisfactory o n two dimensions. In
regard to dialogue, QAG noted strong quality o f engagement with clients and broad confidence built, but
it found shortcomings in the quality o f client participation-in particular beyond government, partnership
arrangements with other donors, and appropriateness o f arrangements for dissemination. In regard to
dissemination, QAG noted Bank input and processes benefited fi-om less than adequate managerial
attention. Overall, the AAA climate i s favorable in Morocco, and the trend in quality and effectiveness i s
upward. Programmatic ESW was introduced and appears to be a particularly effective instrument for
supporting complex reforms with high-quality technical assistance over several years.
32. The CASCR and the QAG review of AAA point to similar recommendations: enhanced focus on
managing for results, greater selectivity and flexibility, shvt toward more programmatic instruments,
better capacity assessment and stakeholder analysis to support institutional reforms, and enhanced
dialogue and dissemination. These recommendations have been discussed extensively by the country
team and are incorporated in the proposed strategy. The results focus o f the CAS provides an opportunity
to manage the Bank program in a dynamic way by monitoring results and responding to changes on a
regular basis. This focus on outcomes also provides an opportunity for greater selectivity. I t offers an

A Country Record Flag is one o f 12 portfolio indicators used to assess the level o f portfolio riskiness. “Net disconnect”
measures the difference between the percentage o f projects rated unsatisfactory (that is, unlikely to achieve their development
objectives) by OED and the percentage rated unsatisfactory by the regions in the final Implementation Status and Results
report. In essence, the net disconnect reflects the degree o f convergence between the region and OED ratings. I t serves as an
indicator o f level o f realism b y regional staff in portfolio performance assessment.

objective lens through which to screen proposed activities according to their potential for results. The
CAS i s made m o r e flexible by not predetermining the lending and AAA program and by offering
adaptable lending scenarios. The CAS plans the use o f development policy loans (DPLs) and SWAPS.
These rely o n a good understanding and ownership o f the institutional reforms, and they will be supported
by capacity assessments and stakeholder analysis in order to better understand the political economy o f
reforms and governance issues. Finally, the country team will continue and reinforce i t s efforts t o ensure
effective dialogue and dissemination o f findings in the lending and AAA programs.

33. IFC increased its involvement in Morocco during the CASperiod with its strong presence on the
ground for technical assistance and advisory services, entrance into the local capital markets, and a
selective investment program. During the CAS period, IFC’s portfolio expanded substantially, becoming
the third largest exposure in the MENA region. Supporting the financial sector has been the centerpiece
of IFC’s program and strategy, particularly as i t supports the development o f SMEs. I F C has worked to
that effect through NAED and n o w PEP MENA, with leading Moroccan banks to help them develop
profitable S M E banlung operations. Moreover, based on the Bank-led Audit and Accounting ROSC, I F C
undertook various initiatives to develop the country’s financial and credit information infrastructure
jointly with the Central Bank. In infrastructure, I F C played a k e y role in advising the government on
structuring and implementing the first public-private partnership globally for irrigation, and mobilized
financing for the f i r s t private mobile operator. On the Treasury front, IFC issued a bond in Morocco
denominated in dirhams - a transaction that was the f i r s t domestic bond offering by a multilateral
institution in Africa as well as in the Middle East - thus broadening the financial markets in the country.
B.

Key Features o f the FY2006-09 CAS

34. The World Bank Group’s comparative advantage is the combination of analytic strength with
financing capacity. I t i s considered a trusted partner and solid reform proponent and, as such, can play an
important role in addressing the key challenges o f institutional reform and strengthening through highquality analytical work and technical assistance backed by programmatic and sector-wide financing.
35. Both flexibility and selectivity will be achieved through use of a ‘%esults framework’’ that
specifies desired outcomes and defines intermediate indicators. The results framework provides
flexibility to respond to evolving demands for analytic and financial services f r o m a sophisticated middleincome client. The mix o f instruments and sectors o f intervention i s not predefined. All new activities
would be assessed according to potential for achieving the outcomes sought. T h i s CAS spans a longer
period than previous ones and will include the legislative elections in 2007. Political, economic, and
social developments that are not entirely foreseeable will influence specific opportunities (and constrain)
advancement. So flexibility i s essential to achieve results through different mixes o f support. In addition,
the government requested t w o criteria for Bank selectivity: to involve sectors in which the Bank can serve
as a catalyst for reform, and to promote engagement among other partners. This approach would help the
CAS to serve as a management tool for choices throughout the operational period.

36. The results frameworkprovides explicit strategic direction, but it is not a blueprint, In line with
the recommendations o f the middle-income countries (MIC) strategy, the C A S framework i s intended to
be sufficiently flexible to respond to evolving government priorities and needs, leaving ample scope for
dialogue to appropriately design future investments and development-policy lending operations. The CAS
does not provide a l i s t of Bank Group activities for the next four years. To do so would neither be feasible
nor desirable given the need for flexibility and responsiveness required by a middle-income country.
Illustrative lending and analytic work programs are suggested for each o f the four strategic objectives
(Annex 2). The Bank’s strategy in Morocco will be implemented in collaboration with bilateral and
multilateral partners in order to minimize duplication o f effort, strengthen synergy, and optimize use o f

14
Bank resources. T h e Bank's partnerships with the EU and the African Development Bank (AFDB) on
public administration reform, telecommunication reform, and financial sector reform have well
demonstrated the benefits o f such collaboration.

Strategic Objectives

3 7. Bank analytic work during CAS preparation involved extensive consultations with government,
civil society, academia, the private sector, and parliamentarians. This led to a consensus view o n the two
key development challenges-accelerating job-creating growth and reducing exclusion (as discussed
above). Four strategic objectives for Bank assistance will help Morocco t o address these challenges. The
objectives share a common underpinning-promotion o f good governance through greater accountability,
transparency, and inclusi~eness.'~
They will be addressed while maintaining overall macroeconomic
balance and with due regard t o government efforts to decrease the budget deficit.

Strategic Objective 1: Improve competitiveness and the investment climate

38. Maintain macroeconomic stability (CAS Outcome 1.1). K e y aspects o f achieving this outcome are
the reduction o f the wage bill to sustainable levels, the reform o f the tax system, and addressing
contingent liabilities-in particular, the pension system and public financial institutions. The Bank will
support this agenda through the Public Administration Reform Loan (PARL), the Financial Sector DPL,
technical assistance, and dialogue focused on pension system reform. Partnerships have been started, with
the European U n i o n and the African Development Bank for the PARL, and with the IMF for the fiscal
system.
39. Increase efficiency of public administration (CAS Outcome 1.2). In 2002, the Bank supported a
Public Expenditure Review (PER) that identified the key challenges t o an efficient public administration.
These include better human resources management in the Moroccan administration, combined with
streamlining o f performance budgeting, administrative dkoncentration, and a clearer control
environment for public spending. Through the P A R L and i t s related Programmatic and Economic Sector
Work (PESW), the Bank will continue to provide financial support, advisory, and technical assistance
services t o accompany and support this reform.

40. Improve the investment climate (CAS Outcome 1.3). Creating a conductive environment for
private sector development and export-oriented entrepreneurship i s key t o economic growth and j o b
creation. The phenomenon o f liquid financial institutions and insufficient financing o f small and medium
enterprises needs t o be addressed through more transparency and corporate governance and by fostering
the capacity o f the banking system for cash-flow and business plan-based financing. It also requires a
more effective land titling system, a functioning judiciary, and reduction o f administrative barriers to
investment. Improving productivity o f the private sector also requires appropriate investments in logistics
and infrastructure. While the focus of this C A S i s not simply on financing infrastructure services in
Morocco, it will support the institutional development needed t o ensure their efficiency and sustainability.
This includes work on an urban public transportation strategy; local finance reform; and the development
o f a clear framework for relations between the state and local governments, as w e l l as between
government and civil society. A series o f analytical studies and projects were carried out-including the
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), two Reports o n the Observance o f Standards and Codes
(ROSCs), the PARL, and a judicial development project. Based o n these developments, the Bank will

l3

See Annex 1: Strategic Objectives.
See Annex 4: CAS Consultations.

15
support private sector development through analytical work on labor markets and land markets and
lending (including but not limited to the PARL and Financial Sector DPL).

41. Increase efficiency of the financial sector, and business access (CAS Outcome 1.4). Morocco’s
financial sector i s presently in the midst o f a restructuring effort, as evidenced by important mergers and
acquisitions and n e w banking legislation aiming at reversing the trend o f non performing loans, the failure
of public financial institutions (CIH, CNCA, BNDE), and unsatisfactory participation in economic growth
financing as evidenced by high liquidities and limited S M E financing. Building o n the recommendations
of the 2002 FSAP, the Bank i s engaged through the Financial Sector DPL in supporting restructuring and
strengthening o f the sector, notably in the areas o f payment systems, banking supervision, anti-money
laundering, accounting and auditing, and the restructuring o f public financial institutions. Partnerships
with the IMF (FSAP) and the EU have been the key to advancing this agenda.
42. As part of Bank Group efforts, IFC will address these challenges by adopting a two-pronged
approach. I t will mobilize funding for large, complex projects that exceed domestic markets’ capacity,
and it will undertake selective investments in the financial sector aimed at boosting sector
competitiveness and capital markets development. IFC’s strategy in Morocco will reflect both
selectivity in its investment work and increase in its technical assistance activities. While IFC i s not
competitive for standard industrial investments, there i s s t i l l an important role to play in the financial
sector and infrastructure. I F C i s needed for innovative projects, namely in the financial sector and large
projects with complex structuring that are not able to find financing locally. IFC will l o o k for
opportunities for equity participations, S M E risk sharing facilities with banks, through structured finance
instruments such as partial risk guarantees, as well as support for microfinance and housing finance. I F C
also will look for opportunities t o invest in private infrastructure, namely the power and water sectors,
building upon such efforts as the irrigation advisory work and telecoms.
43. Building on the findings o f the FSAP and the joint W o r l d B a n W F C Investment Climate
Assessment, F C will also seek through PEP MENA to step up i t s technical assistance and advisory
services, focusing on furthering financial markets development, including improving banks risk
management and governance practices. These initiatives should contribute to increase S M E access to
finance, improve corporate governance practices among financial institutions, and build the much needed
credit information and reporting systems for the country. I t will also support various business-enabling
environment initiatives, mandates for privatization, restructuring and public-private partnerships,
particularly in the infrastructure sector.

44. Increase competitiveness of small and middle-size farms (CAS Outcome 1.5). This outcome
targets one facet o f the agricultural sector, namely i t s competitiveness. Through an Agriculture Sector
DPL, the Bank will support an enabling environment for broad-based agriculture growth and
competitivity. The DPL will aim at reducing price distortions; make better use o f public funds; enact
structural and institutional reforms, notably in the areas o f land tenure and agricultural services; and
upgrade main commodity chains through producer associations, public-private partnerships for R&D,
capacity-building programs, and the promotion o f product quality. In addition, the Bank’s recent
analytical work on household impact o f possible agricultural price reforms will contribute t o a dialogue
on easing the social costs o f transition for the rural poor.
Strategic Objective 2: Increase access to basic services by poor and marginalized groups

45. Reduce the number of households living in slums by 60 percent (CAS Outcome 2.1). The Bank
will support the government in designing and implementing the Cities without Slums program. The
program i s progressing well; however, uncertainties remain about the sustainability o f its financial
instruments, such as the guarantee mechanisms and the savings schemes. Transparent land titling and real

16
estate tax reform are also important for guaranteeing decent housing for the poor. Bank support will be
mobilized through the Low-Income Housing DPL in coordination with other donors, such as the
European U n i o n a n d the French Development Agency (AFD).

46. Improve access to basic services, social programs, and economic opportunities in pockets of
poverty and vulnerability (CAS Outcome 2.2). The Bank will continue i t s technical assistance t o the Haut
Commissariat au Plan. T h i s will allow a second, updated poverty map to be completed. This more
advanced map w i l l b e used to target pockets o f poverty in rural, urban, and peri-urban areas. The Poverty
PESW will improve coordination and sharing o f data, strengthening poverty program’s capacity to
develop tools to identify vulnerable groups and regions. Such information i s especially important when
specific economy wide reforms are carried out. T h i s will encourage stronger local partnerships among
local governments, deconcentrated line ministries, and c i v i l society. A series o f integrated rural
development projects will be designed to develop sustainable local infrastructure and encourage economic
opportunities in poor areas. Bank work will continue on health insurance to help improve access t o health
services for the poor through arrangements that are financially sustainable.
Strategic Objective 3: Improve education system efficiency

47. Increase access to and quality of basic education (CAS Outcome 3.1). An unresolved issue in the
Moroccan educational system i s the school-retention rate in basic education and equitable access t o postbasic studies. Through PARSEM, the Bank has a conducive sector wide instrument that spans the CAS
period, to help Morocco achieve this outcome. The Bank has begun w o r k with the government in
developing the deconcentration o f the education sector’s management through the development o f
contract schemes with regional academies (AREFs). I t also conducts a positive dialogue on the need to
align the education budget with the sector’s objectives through contractualisation and the development o f
performance-based budgeting. The Programme d ’Appui a la Reformed du Systeme Educatif Marocain
(PARSEM) and the PARL are the lead Bank instruments t o achieve this outcome. I t i s also proposed to
include strengthening o f private sector participation in education as a topic in the Bank’s dialogue with
the government.
48. Increase graduation and employment rates for high school, higher education, and vocational
training students (CAS Outcome 3.2). Educational quality i s a major component o f the PARSEM. The
challenge i s to make sustainable improvements in high school and university education, and t o foster
necessary linkage between formal training and entering the workforce. This will entail reorganizing and
modernizing the secondary school system and giving more autonomy to universities, which will lead
them incrementally toward more financial and administrative independence and greater private sector
participation. The Bank has launched programmatic E S W o n higher education that may emerge as a selfstanding lending operation.
Strategic Objective 4: Improve water management and access to water and sanitation services

49. Improve the legal, financial, and institutional framework in the water sector (Outcome 4.1). The
challenge i s to optimize the roles and capacities o f water sector institutions in developing and
implementing a more effective water sector strategy. This entails improving intrasectoral coordination,
matching sector financing mechanisms to sector priorities (including integrated water resources
management through river basin agencies), and strengthening operator regulation. Bank support for the
next four years will include ongoing work on areas o f better water sector governance. This will include
studies on institutional reforms for large irrigation projects and o n financial and institutional aspects o f
drinlung water purification and supply, and integrated management o f water resources. I t will also include

17
lendingI4. The indicative program involves technical assistance in institutional capacity building and
sector reform.

50.
Improve access and treatment coverage in targeted basins (CAS Outcome 4.2). There i s urgent
need to support infrastructure development to reverse widespread environmental water quality
degradation and resource depletion, promote the sustainable use and conservation o f water resources, and
open more equitable access to services in urban, peri-urban and rural areas. This could be achieved in
several ways. First, establish sustainable mechanisms o f output-based interventions to reduce agncultural,
industrial, and municipal pollution at the basin and sub-basin levels, as well as for water supply and
sanitation access in poor or unconnected communities. Second, establish an incentive and cost-recovery
system for water, wastewater treatment, and industrial pollution control. Third, adopt an efficient
compliance and enforcement system based o n upstream considerations in planning water policy,
programs, and projects, as well as more predictable environmental guidelines for private sector
development. These outcomes-in
particular, those linked to pollution control and environmental
resource protection-could ideally be pursued through an integrated water and environmental
management approach in one or two basins-Oum Rabia or Sebou. Bank support over the CAS period
will involve a second water management and sanitation project (FY2006), a rural potable water and
sanitation project (FY2007), and targeted WBI technical assistance for capacity building.
51. Improved technical and financial performance of water sector operators (CAS Outcome 4.3).
Closing Morocco’s water infrastructure gap will require increased financing autonomy by providers in the
irrigation sub-sector and in the water supply and sanitation sub-sector. The operating performance o f both
sub-sectors needs to be improved. A wide range o f support actions are envisioned-enhancement o f
revenue strategies and the operating efficiency o f selected operators, strengthening management
capacities, and introducing private sector participation. The restructuring o f operating perimeters for
multi-sector service distribution would be assessed and piloted, as well as innovative approaches to
finance and support service in underserved urbadperi-urban and rural areas. Bank support will be
provided through the lending and technical assistance instruments described above.

T h e underpinning for thefour strategic objectives: Improved governance

52. The issue of governance cuts across the entire CAS,from the efficiency of service delivery to the
rules that govern economic activities. The Bank program will integrate governance across sectors,
focusing on transparency, accountability, and inclusi~eness.’~

53. Transparency is a prerequisite for good governance in both public and private sectors. While
transparency i s a key for public sector accountability, i t i s also necessary for proper functioning o f a
market economy so that investors and lenders have complete information to assess risk. Through i t s
involvement in public administration reform (via PARL), the judiciary (via the Legal and Judicial
Development Project), the financial sector (including FSAP, AAA, and ROSC), the Bank has
strengthened transparency as a governance pillar and will continue to do so throughout CAS
implementation.
54. Accountability requires that those who are selected to act in the name of others are answerable
for their failures and creditedfor their successes. “Internal accountability” refers to rules and incentives
to govern the public sector and establish a system o f checks and balances. This i s the main focus o f the
l4Water

Resource Management and Rural Water Sanitation and Managementprojects.

’’These issues are identified

and described in the MENA Region Govemance Report, 2003, “Better Govemance for
Development in the Middle East and North Africa Region.”

18
work on public administrative reform (PARL), as well as the institution building accompanying sectoral
efforts such as integrated rural development projects and dialogue on the rule o f law.16 Performance-based
budgeting, contractualisation, and Bank support to implement the integrated management o f public
expenditures (Gestion Integrie des Dipenses, known as GID) are major components o f the P A R L . They
reflect the need t o clarify roles and responsibilities in order to strengthen actors’ performance o f assigned
roles and to create new incentives to improve performance. “External accountability” refers to holding
government accountable. Enhancing extemal accountability in Morocco at the present time i s particularly
relevant because o f the political opening and the growing potential o f c i v i l society to help ensure good
governance-as a partner to government in service delivery, as a democratic voice to express needs and
preferences at the central and local levels, and as a watchdog. The Bank will continue i t s work with civil
society organizations and local officials t o improve transparency and partnershps. This includes
supporting training o n the budget process for parliamentarians and emphasizing outreach and
dissemination t o better inform the population on issues affecting the country.

55. Inclusiveness is important for reaching marginalized groups, including equal access to
government and economic opportunities for women. This concept cuts across the C A S since it applies to
the provision o f public services as well as to productive activities for the poor and marginalized. I t
includes encouraging the full participation o f women and youth, promoting an impartial judiciary, and
helping to foster a business environment that will be marked by greater participation o f small and medium
enterprises.
D.

Bank Instruments

56. The Bank will rely on a mix o f analytical work, capacity building, and lending products to achieve
the results specified in this CAS.
57. Analytical and advisory services: The Bank will continue to invest in high-quality analytic and
advisory services, with increased attention to measuring impact, responding to client demand, putting
forward critical reform issues, and dissemination. Analytical work will continue t o be the main driver o f
the strategy, as experience with programmatic E S W has shown time and again that strong analytic work
leads to sound lending. The Bank’s comparative advantage lies in i t s focus o n capacity building in which
strong analytic work i s combined with financing capacity. The integrated w o r k program o f WBI and
PESW will be key to structuring reform commitments in areas where Bank financing i s not required but
Bank involvement i s sought. As part o f the monitoring o f C A S outcomes, task teams will systematically
document h o w specific AAA products contribute to achieving C A S outcomes. Dissemination will be
ensured through Country Office use o f speakers programs and roundtables in the six public information
centers covering the country, as well as through dialogue with c i v i l society partners and the press.
58. Financial Products: Bank lending will focus increasingly on development policy loans and sector
wide approaches. As mentioned above, institutional dimensions will receive greater focus, as successful
reform often hinges on institutional bottlenecks. DPLs and SWAPS are the most appropriate lending
instruments to address such issues. The relative sophistication o f Moroccan fiduciary systems permits
increased reliance on such instruments.

59. Morocco is a good candidate for scaling up Bank interventions and reducing costs through
further reliance on country systems. The Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR), Country
Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA), Independent Procurement Review (IPR), and environment
sector work all indicate that Morocco’s fiduciary and safeguard procedures are, for the most part, well
l6 Legal and Judicial

Development Project,

19
designed; and its laws and regulations are o f high quality. Improvement i s required, however, in
implementation, so Bank technical assistance will increasingly focus o n implementation issues. The Bank
will assess procedures and, in particular, implementation capacity in given sectors to determine the extent
to which use o f country systems i s indicated.

60. The Bank will increase its assistance to structure an adequate portfolio of I B R D financial
products and services. T h i s assistance will focus on the potential use o f existing IBRD financial products
to manage Morocco’s financial risks. The government has diversified its funding sources in recent years,
tapping financial markets efficiently. IBRD lending has contributed to lowering the cost and overall risk
structure o f its overall funding program. For new IBRD loans, Morocco has moved to fixed-spread loans
with embedded r i s k management tools. In addition, Morocco and the Bank signed a Master Derivatives
Agreement in October 2004. This agreement provides a range o f hedging products linked to existing
IBRD loans, as w e l l as technical support from the World Bank’s treasury staff.
E.

Partnerships

61. Cooperation with development partners has been close in recent years and will continue during
the CAS period. Bank teams will continue to work with bilateral donors, Arab Funds, the Islamic
Development Bank, and the African Development Bank. The focus will be o n increased upstream
collaboration o n strateges, shared analytic work, and effective cofinancing. The Bank will continue i t s
close ongoing collaboration with the IMF.
62. I n light of Morocco’s agreement with the European Union on an Action Plan in the context of
the New Neighborhood Policy, enhanced cooperation would be sought with EU institutions on
upstream coordination, joint analytic work, and joint financing. M o r e rapid integration with Europe
could be a crucial economic driver for Morocco in coming years. This offers opportunities for analytic
work o n the implications o f economic integration and harmonization with EU r u l e s and regulations. The
Bank and the EU see their roles as complementary, and b o t h have a strong working relationship in
Morocco. Given the economic and political ties to Europe, the EU i s the key strategic partner for
Morocco. In addition, large financial transfers make the EU Morocco’s largest official financer. The
European Commission and the Bank have agreed to early consultations during preparation o f their
respective strategies and will explore opportunities for joint analytic work. Joint financing i s already in
place for a series of programmatic PARLs, and opportunities for expansion t o other areas will be
explored. The European Investment Bank (ED) and the W o r l d Bank have also agreed to explore
opportunities for increased collaboration during the CAS period.

63. I n building partnerships within Morocco, the Country Office will continue its proactive work in
outreach and communication. In 2004, six public information centers (PICs) were set up in national
libraries and universities, and a quarterly newsletter was published. PICs are platforms for dissemination
of Bank reports and studies, debates, and roundtables about development issues o f interest to the
Moroccan public. Bank teams will hold a larger number o f such meetings in regard to lending and
analytical work. The PICs will serve as a gathering point t o build ownership for projects and to instill
stakeholder participation in the Bank’s operations. The C A S team conducted a wide number o f upstream
consultations, often using the PICs as a preferred site. Consultations included all major stakeholders in the
definition and implementation o f Morocco’s economic and social agenda, and involved government
officials, parliamentarians, academics, the private sector and a l l streams o f c i v i l society”. Taking
advantage of Morocco’s openness, CAS dissemination will be, as was the case for the consultations,
multi-pronged. The press, the PICs, and the newsletter will all be employed as conduits and
communication vehicles.

F.

Lending Scenarios

64. For FY2006-09, a flexible program of $250 to $350 million a year on average is proposed to
support the strategic objectives of the CAS. As noted above, Morocco has diversified sources o f external
financing, and the level o f Bank lending does not represent traditional “leverage” for accelerating a
reform agenda. The government has indicated i t s desire to borrow on the order o f $300 m i l l i o n per year as
part o f i t s overall funding program under macroeconomic scenarios equivalent t o the base and highgrowth scenarios presented in Section 11. This provides appropriate flexibility t o respond t o high-quality
lending opportunities to support growth and related reforms. Although IBRD credit exposure i s
moderately high, the proposed lending amounts are consistent with sound risk management in view o f
recent progress, base-case projections, the outcome indicators set in this CAS, and the evolution o f IBRD
exposure indicators. The lending program will be managed actively to ensure that the overall size and
disbursement profile o f loan commitments does not cause a deterioration o f IBRD exposure indicators
and, in particular, that i t maintains the ratio o f IBRD exposure to GDP broadly at or below i t s current
level.
65. Reduced IBRD lending would be triggered by a failure to maintain a stable macroeconomic
framework. The Bank would reduce annual lending in the event o f a significant deterioration in the main
macroeconomic indicators relative to the base case scenario (Tables 1 and 2). In particular, a l o w case
scenario would be triggered by a failure o f Morocco t o move in the direction o f a sustainable fiscal
deficit, as evidenced by a public sector deficit that would exceed the base case targets for 2005-09 in
Table 1 by 0.5 percent o f GDP. A l o w case would also be triggered by a ratio o f central government debt
to GDP exceeding 72 percent at any point over the CAS period.

66. Country financing parameters have been prepared and agreed upon by the government.” Bankfinanced projects are fully integrated into the budget and are well aligned with the government’s
development programs. The Bank’s lending program represents a very small share o f the Moroccan
government’s overall economic and social development spending. Whether financed through Bank loans,
government revenues, or other sources, public expenditures are subject to the same government fiscal
rules. In light o f these factors, and provided that i t stays within the overall CAS lending envelope, the
Bank could finance up to 100 percent o f costs o f individual operations.
G.

Results-Based Monitoring and Evaluation

67. Monitoring of the CAS will rely on strengthening existing mechanisms for data collection and
outcome and output indicators available in the Bank portfolio of projects and analytic work. On the
government side, the current management o f information and decision-making processes i s heavily
focused on outputs such as budget spending. Projected results and impact are less likely t o be measured.
There has been, however, a gradual shift toward performance budgeting and contractualization, as
outlined in the PARL. A major challenge for the C A S i s i t s ability to ensure that policies and budget
allocations are based o n a trustworthy system o f continuous evaluation that promotes accountability. T w o
specific issues should be monitored. First, what i s the level o f integration and coordination o f policies,
activity planning, and budgeting between the Ministry o f Finance and sector ministries, as w e l l as among
the sector-level and deconcentrated entities? Second, i s the relationship clear between spending and
results? The Bank will continue to assist the government in strengthening i t s results-based management
capabilities. This includes building permanent in-country capacity through the Institutional Development
Fund (IDF) on training of trainers in results-based monitoring and evaluation. On the Bank side, using the
C A S as a management tool will help task managers to closely monitor progress in outcomes. This will

’*

See Annex 5 : Morocco-Country

Financing Parameters.

21
also serve as an incentive to design simpler results-oriented projects that take into account the
implementation capacity o f the borrower at appraisal time. Capacity building efforts in monitoring and
evaluation within Bank teams will continue so as to ensure that the C A S i s effectively and regularly
monitored, and that results are used to address eventual challenges and to generate lessons.

IV. MANAGING R I S K S
68. The broadest risk facing the Morocco program is that insufficient growth, high unemployment,
and social disparities, will lead to socio-political tensions which hinder further economic and social
reforms. These risks are well known to the Moroccan govemment. They can be mitigated through
decisive policy and institutional reforms leading to a more growth-oriented and competitive economy and
explicit policies t o provide services and opportunity to extended groups. As a frank partner o f reform, the
Bank i s called upon to back growth-oriented policies through dialogue, policy analysis and financial
assistance.

69. A second risk is that Government commitment to reform will not be translated into action. Given
the multitude o f actors, Morocco’s decision-malung processes are often hesitant. Consensus i s hard to
reach, giving way t o cumbersome negotiations with l o w tolerance for r i s k takmg. Greater interministerial
coordination and improved budget mechanisms can help in implementingthe government’s programs and
priorities. While the Bank i s involved through the P A R L in streamlining and rationalizing budget
processes, the environment in which decisions are reached i s likely to remain complex. The Bank will
mitigate this risk by supporting transparent decision-mahng and systematic political-economy analysis of
stakeholders. A recent pilot program focused o n agricultural reform proved very useful in this respect.
70. Finally, the Bank faces institutional risks regarding its continued relevance to Morocco as a
sophisticated middle-income country. Large increased concessional financing from the European Union
through i t s N e w Neighborhood Policy may reduce Morocco’s need for Bank financing. At the same time,
need will increase for technical knowledge to advance the reform agenda. To remain relevant, the Bank
must respond to those demands through high-quality analytical and technical advice provided in a timely
manner and accompanied by appropriate financial instruments. The Bank also has to continue building
synergies with Morocco’s development partners, especially greater complementarity with the EU.

C A S Annex 3 : MOROCCO C A S COMPLETION REPORT 2001-04

Date o f CAS: M a y 7,2001
Progress Report: None required
Period covered by CAS: M a y 2001-June 2004 (Fiscal years 2001-04)
Period covered by the present report: M a y 2001-February 2005
Completion Report prepared by: CCcile Fruman, Senior Country Officer
Introduction

1.
T h e C A S completion report (CASCR) assesses the effectiveness o f the 2001 Country
Assistance Strategy for Morocco in bringing about expected results and highlights the lessons
learned over the period. The report’s conclusions will shape the new CAS. It i s not a formal
evaluation, but a self-evaluation tool for the Bank’s country team.
2.
C A S C R conclusions were identified in close collaboration with the Bank’s main
partners in Morocco. T h i s process was participatory in nature and consisted o f a workshop in June
2004 and t w o meetings with key partner ministries during which completion report conclusions were
discussed and validated. This analysis was accompanied by key reference documents, as well as the
conclusions o f the Bank’s Quality Assurance Group (QAG) Country Analytical and Advisory
Activity (AAA) Assessment.” In December 2004, the report’s conclusions and recommendations
were discussed in detail with members o f the Morocco country team. This allowed them to identify
concrete measures to improve the Bank’s performance during the n e w C A S period.
3.

T h e completion report reviews C A S implementation f r o m the perspective o f the Bank’s
results framework. Given that its time frame dates back t o 2001, when the Bank’s focus o n
managing for results was not yet articulated, the C A S does not identify a set o f core measurable
outcomes. For this reason, the author o f t h s report had to summarize the intended C A S outcomes,
which could only be formulated generally. Moreover, it was difficult to demonstrate progress in each
of the outcome areas because the C A S document did not identify monitoring indicators for each
outcome, but eight core performance indicators that essentially measure long-term development goals
specified in the five year Plan (the Plan) and 11 C A S monitoring indicators (see Appendix Table 2)
that were n o quantitative and combined outputs with intermediate outcomes.“ When indicators did
show progress, it was difficult to attribute changes to the Bank’s activities.

4.

T h e 2001 C A S was aligned with the five-year plan (2000-04) whose central goal was to
accelerate growth to an average o f 5 percent a year while ensuring that the objectives of equity
and inclusion were met. The plan focused o n four major challenges: (1) accelerating growth with
higher levels o f public investment, structural reforms, and private sector development; (2) improving
the poverty focus of public policies and expenditures; (3) reforming the state; (4) reducing the
agricultural sector’s vulnerability and environmental threats. Although the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs) were not identified specifically as such in the Plan, numerous goals aimed to reduce
poverty and improve living conditions. Progress has been made o n the MDGs, as illustrated by the
rising literacy rate o f girls aged 15-24 years from 77.9 percent in 2001 to 79.2 percent in 2002; the
decreasing infant mortality rate f r o m 41 per 1,000 in 2001 to 39 per 1,000 in 2002; the decrease in

transmissible diseases; the noticeable improvement in indicators documenting access to computers
and telephone lines. However, large inequalities still remain between rural and urban areas, and m u c h
progress i s yet to be made before reachng the MDGs, especially in rural areas.

5.
During the CAS implementation period, Morocco’s long-term goals did not change f r o m
those specified in the 2000-04 Plan. However, priorities and policies implemented were often
adapted to respond to new exogenous shocks. For example, the tourism crisis caused by the tragic
events o f September 11 made boosting this sector one o f the government’s key priorities. A strategy
called Vision 2010 was developed, setting a goal o f attracting 10 m i l l i o n tourists by 2010. The M a y
16, 2003, attacks in Casablanca were equally important in pushing the government to make l o w income housing a priority. The government i s fundamentally changing policies, paying much closer
attention to social issues and making services more readily accessible to the poor and vulnerable,
Creation o f the Ministry o f Social Development, Family, and Solidarity in M a y 2004 i s a concrete
example o f this new orientation. Finally, the government made the textile sector a m a i n priority
because it i s one o f the country’s largest exporters and a large source o f employment, yet i s heavily
threatened by external competition.

6.
During 2001-04, the economic situation improved moderately and Morocco remained in
the Base Case CAS scenario. The country maintained an average yearly growth rate o f 4.5 percent,
principally because o f the satisfactory performance o f the agricultural sector and a more modest
improvement in growth in nonagricultural sectors. Morocco’s external position has strengthened as
current accounts have been in surplus since 2001 and external reserves have increased. Inflation has
remained stable and at l o w levels, around 2 percent since 2000. However, although the fiscal position
began to strengthen in 2002, government direct debt remains high at 69 percent o f GDP in 2004. Ths
cannot be sustained long-term. Privatization proceeds have weakened fiscal discipline and have been
used t o finance increases in the wage bill. In 2004, progress was judged sufficient for Bank financing
of a sector reform program to support reforms in public administration. The t w o fiscal triggers set out
in the C A S were reached: budget revenues were maintained at 24 percent o f GDP, and the wage bill
and other current expenditures were contained.22 Despite an increase in the wage bill in 2003, the
Bank deemed that the measures taken by the government t o control future increases in the wage bill
and stabilize public revenues were adequate.
11. Progress and CAS Results23

7.
T h e key objective of the 2001 CAS was to “deepen the Bank’s poverty focus through
community-based and decentralization approaches” a n d “to promote strong analytical w o r k
and dialogue on the conditions needed to revitalize private investment and
This
objective was chosen because Morocco was in the vanguard o f the M i d d l e East and N o r t h A f h c a in
terms of an open c i v i l society, democratization, promotion o f the rule o f law, decentralization, and
community participation. Yet i t was recognized that the economic policies o f the government were
unlikely to have a sustained impact o n poverty reduction as l o n g as stronger growth and agncultural
reform agendas were not adopted. This objective was supported by four C A S pillars, analyzed below.
8.
Outcomes for each pillar are analyzed in terms o f the pillar’s main objective, its
supportive assistance instruments, its achievements related to CAS results, and the performance
and monitoring indicators. An effort was made to focus o n the instruments that inform the different
outcomes rather than o n each particular project or loan. I t i s understood that activities in any particular
pillar are likely to contribute to the outcomes o f other pillars, that C A S activities build o n each other,
and that each outcome i s likely to be influenced by more than one instrument and by activities in other

Budget revenues as a percentage of GDP were 24.7 percent in 2002, 24.1 percent in 2003, and 24 percent in 2004.
Wage bill growth was between 1 and 3 percent a year, except for 2003 (1 1 percent); and capital expenses and other
current expenses slightly decreased (fiom 11.2 percent of GDP in 2002 to 10.6 percent in 2004).

pillars. Consequently, pillars are not separated or seen in isolation, but as the m a i n arteries through
which efforts and resources f l o w in the direction towards achieving the CAS goals. CAS results are
summarized in Table 1 o f the Appendix.

A. Pillar IOutcomes: Poverty reduction through inclusion and participation

9.
This pillar was aligned with the government's goal to better target its policies and public
spending on poverty reduction. Core performance indicators identified for this pillar show a
positive evolution (Table 3). The pillar combines social sectors (education, health, and social
protection), rural development, and poverty analysis. Most program activities supporting this pillar
were completed as projected, with some variations. In particular, some projected projects were
replaced by analytical work. Activities undertaken are compared to those projected in Table 4 below,
which i s organized according to each expected outcome.

Outcome 1.1. Poor rural areas better developed: Achieved.

10.
Performance indicators show significant progress toward achieving this outcome (see
Table 3). In rural areas, poverty levels have decreased, girls' educational levels have surpassed goals,
and access to drinking water improved greatly. Rural infrastructure programs n o w reach a larger
portion o f the rural population, however data about whether the Plan's projected coverage levels o f 60
to 70 percent were reached (a C A S monitoring indicator) was not available. One reason for the
significant drop in rural poverty levels i s the good rainfall levels and excellent harvests o f recent
years. Active government policies and programs targeting rural areas and a rise in participation o f
civil society help explain progress in the other indicators.

11.
World Bank programs contributed to this outcome, particularly in terms of rural
infrastructure development. Almost all Bank projects reached their development objectives, and
many surpassed their targets in financing infrastructure. Some notable examples are hghlighted
below:
0 The Secondary Roads project has led t o construction o f nearly 1,000 hlometers o f paved and
rural roads. The economic rate o f return o n roads was hgh, estimated at 30-50 percent, and
these investments appear sustainable. The CoordinatiodMonitoring o f Social Programs project
contributed to construction o f 2,360 kilometers o f roads in the 14 provinces covered by BAJ.25
All o f these roads have benefited local populations by providing improved access t o schools and
health centers as well as lowering prices o n basic products and facilitating implementation o f
rural electrification and drinlung water programs, etc.
0 The Rural Water Supply and Sanitation project (PAGER) benefited 304,000 people, more than
double the initial goal outlined for the project. Sanitation and access to potable water was
improved considerably, and the time women and girls spent fetching water was reduced 5C-90
percent, w h i c h translated into higher school attendance among girls.
0 The SPP Education project financed more than 2,400 rural community schools in the 14
provinces covered by BAJ, well above the target o f 1,370 schools. This l e d t o an increase in
primary education from 58 percent in 1995196 t o 92 percent in 2000/01, surpassing the project
goal o f 86 percent. At the same time, the level o f girls’ education increased from 38 percent to
82.5 percent, exceeding the target o f 72.8 percent.
12.
Bank projects’ participatory approach to rural development was progressively adopted.
The Lakhdar Watershed Management project l e d t o creation o f 26 village committees that play a
substantial role in preparing and implementing community development plans, invigorating the socio
development dynamic and improving institutional capacities. Both the Irrigation-Based Community
Development project (DRI-PMH) and the Rainfed Agriculture Development project (DRI-MVB) use
a participatory approach, which has increased the time needed t o identify project activities and l e d t o
implementation delays. Implementation o f these integrated rural development projects also has been
hampered by lack o f an effective institutional set-up that promotes integration, participation, and
decentralization; weak institutional capacity o f local govemments and businesses in remote areas; and
complex administrative payment systems not conducive to local contract financing. However, the
approach remains promising since local development associations are a driving force for institutional
change. The Social Development Agency project ( A D S ) also encourages a participatory approach
through i t s work with NGOs and beneficiary groups.

13.
On the other hand, it i s difficult to demonstrate that Bank-financed projects have led to
increased revenues and living standards for the rural population. T h i s i s because data i s l a c h n g
and many projects are still in their early implementation. One effort that has had considerable impact
o n the population’s income i s the National Promotion program, supported by the
Coordinationhlonitoring o f Social Programs project. M o r e than 4 m i l l i o n days o f paid employment
were generated from building basic infrastructure. This work, mostly unskilled, paid about US$20
m i l l i o n and benefited more than 300,000 rural families in the 14 covered provinces. Nonetheless, the
program seemingly did not reach the poorest families.26

38
Outcome 1.2. Education Charter Implemented: Achieved.
Implementation of the Education Charter led to important reforms in the sector and
14.
improved access to education. Rural girls’ net education rate (NER) as compared to urban boys’
NER progressed from 53 percent in 2000 to 85.6 percent in 2003/04. In addition, CAS monitoring
indicators were met: (1) agreement was reached and progress made on implementing a reform plan for
universal primary education, and (2) the number of community schools increased and the social fund
was implemented ( A D S ) .

15.
Bank activities accompanied the process of implementing the Education Charter and
helped improve educational access. T h e Bank’s various analytical work (see Table 4) as well as the
preparation process for a significant operation, PARSEM, supported a high level dialogue between the
World Bank and the government, focusing on implementation o f the Education Charter and on quality
improvement. As explained in Outcome 1.1, the SPP Education project had a significant impact on
access. The 14 provinces covered by BAJ saw a growth in the number o f children in primary school
o f 48 percent between 1996197 and 2002/03, compared to a national increase o f 28 percent. However,
retention-rates for girls in elementary school increased less than the 65 percent projected, moving
from 36 percent in 1994195 to 42 percent in 2000/2001. It i s fair to say that the project appraisal target
was probably too ambitious. In addition, this project tested a new approach to participation and
inclusion by involving NGOs and beneficiary groups in numerous activities.
Outcome 1.3. Increased number ofparticipants in literacy programs: Achieved.

16.
By year-end 2004, a total of 1.2 million people participated in the adult literacy
campaign launched in 2001. The CAS monitoring indicator, which was the successful launching o f
the campaign, was met. However, the campaign was unable to reach i t s quantitative target o f enrolling
1,800,000 people by 2004. In addition, data i s unavailable to demonstrate if the campaign has
increased literacy levels.

17.
The Bank supported the government’s efforts both conceptually and with financing, but
without great impact. The 2002 evaluation o f Morocco’s existing adult literacy programs facilitated
the preparation of the Alpha Maroc project for 2003-06. However, implementation o f this adult
literacy project has been delayed and i t i s uncertain if it will reach i t s development objectives,
including quality improvements in literacy programming and stronger management through
partnerships between the government and service providers. This approach i s innovative and supports
one o f the key goals of Pillar I,
which i s to encourage participation and inclusion.
Outcome 1.4. Better understanding of the dimensions of poverty (including for women and
children) :Achieved.

18.
The Bank has had a significant impact in improving the analysis and understanding of
poverty in Morocco. The 2004 Poverty Report introduced many innovations in the measurement and
analysis o f poverty, in particular the development o f communal poverty maps. Analysis o f these maps
will allow resources to be better targeted toward the most disadvantaged communes, improving the
efficiency o f poverty reduction programs. The report also led to development o f a simulation model
that estimates in detail the effects of cereals reform on households, a qualitative study on the links
between poverty and girls’ education, and an evaluation o f statistical systems available to monitor
social conditions. The report i s timely, supporting the government’s renewed efforts following the
Casablanca bombings in May 2003 to identify policies and programs to reduce poverty, including in
urban areas, and to analyze the distribution o f economic growth among the poor and vulnerable. The
government praised the participatory process adopted in drafting this report as well as its focus on
building institutional capacity so that Morocco can continue to carry out analysis in the future. Q A G
rated the report as hghly satisfactory.

39
19.
T h e Bank also had considerable influence in the debate on women’s issues a n d
encouraged the use of gender budgeting. During the C A S period, the Bank monitored and
supported implementation o f the National Action Plan for the Integration o f Women in Development,
which was developed with the Bank’s support in 1998. The plan’s recommendations became a reality
when the n e w family code, the Moudawana, went into effect o n February 5, 2004, increasing
womens’ rights. Numerous c i v i l society actors say that the W o r l d Bank played a key role in the
adoption o f this law. The Bank also supported the implementation o f gender budgeting withm the
Ministry o f Finance and other sectoral ministries through several training workshops. This program i s
ongoing with the support o f UNIFEM.
Outcome 1.5. Improved health service access and sectoral financial management through the
implementation of national health insurance: Partially achieved.

20.
Although this outcome i s formulated broadly, without progress indicators, it i s fair to
say that access to basic health care services improved, though below expectations. The SPP
Health Management project only partially achieved i t s development objectives. Despite construction
and renovation of more than 260 health centers in 14 provinces, access to basic treatment only
increased f r o m 4 7 to 50 percent f r o m 1995 to 2002, below the anticipated 60 percent. In early 2003,
128 health care centers closed because o f personnel shortages, and the Ministry had yet t o implement
a human resource strategy to efficiently manage the distribution o f staff in rural areas. The budget for
pharmaceuticals increased to 23 percent in provinces, providing better access t o medication. Assisted
births greatly increased, from 18.5 percent in 1995 to 47 percent in 2002, exceeding the 30 percent
target; but many problems persist in maternal health. In 11 o f 14 provinces, vaccination programs
reached their population target o f 90 percent. The incidence o f infectious diseases stabilized o r
diminished. However, i t i s not possible to demonstrate if the Bank’s A I D S study had any impact or
l e d to increased access to prevention and treatment services.
2 1.
M u c h progress has been made in managing and financing the health sector. A new health
insurance l a w was adopted in 2004 and took effect in January 2005, and a National Agency for Health
Insurance was created. T o support the Health Sector Management project, the Bank provided eight
working committees headed by the Prime Minister with technical assistance t o enable them t o analyze
reform options and develop implementation measures. Progress also was made in strengthening the
strategic planning and managerial capacity, the quality, and the efficiency o f 14 public hospitals
supported by the Health Management project. The Health Ministry’s policy formulation and sector
management ability should continue to improve as a result o f the complete organizational audit and
the review o f human resources financed by the project. The project monitoring and evaluation system
i s weak, however, and must be improved in order to be able to demonstrate tangible results when the
project i s completed.
B. Pillar I1 Outcomes: Growth and Private Sector Development to Support Job Creation

22.

This pillar was aligned with the Plan o f 2000, and performance indicators show some
progress in achieving the objective. In line with the plan’s primary goal o f accelerated growth, t h s
pillar aimed at creating the conditions necessary for sustainable economic expansion and j o b creation.
Poverty incidence-ne
o f the t w o core performance indicators-was
reduced due in large part to
good agricultural seasons since nonagricultural growth has remained weak and below expectations,
averaging only 3.2 percent over this period. However, fiscal deficit reduction did not reach the
anticipated levels (Table 5). Although unemployment levels were n o t used as a performance indicator,
i t i s worth noting that unemployment figures have evolved favorably over the period, going f r o m a
national average o f 13.6 percent and an urban rate o f 21.5 percent in 2000 t o 11 percent and 18.7
percent respectively in 2004. Financial support provided under t h s pillar was aligned with what was
proposed, and the AAA program was even richer than anticipated (Table 6). The N o r t h A f i i c a
Enterprise Development Program (NAEiD), established by the International Finance Corporation
(IFC) in Morocco in 2002, played an increasingly important role in program implementation.

Outcome 2.1. Developed consensus on a growth-oriented economicpolicy framework: Achieved.

23.

Overall, the Bank’s activities met the C A S objective o f “reaching an agreement o n a
growth-oriented economic policy framework.” The various studies conducted by the Bank were
good diagnostic tools, and the techmcal assistance was o f high quality and raised awareness about
certain key reforms, as illustrated below:

The public expenditure review, the continued dialogue o n macroeconomic sustainability, and

the public adrmnistration PESW helped raise awareness o f the importance o f monetary policy
reform, trade liberalization, and above all, fiscal sustainability. A consensus was reached o n
the need to reduce the fiscal deficit t o 3 percent by 2008 and to decrease the wage bill f r o m 13
percent in 2000 to 11 percent o f GDP in 2004. T h i s was a breakthrough as a consensus o f this
nature had not been reached during the previous C A S period. Nevertheless, t h s agreement
did not lead to a containment o f fiscal deficit and restructuring o f fiscal expenditures, which
was one o f the two monitoring indicators o f this pillar.
The Financial Sector Assessment Program conducted a pertinent analysis o f the strengths and
constraints o f the financial system. Based o n this analysis, w h c h the Quality Assurance
Group rated as highly satisfactory, the government has asked the Bank to prepare a financial
sector adjustment operation, which i s currently being finalized.
Techmcal assistance provided to the Planning Department o f the Ministry o f Finance and the
report o n “Labor Market Policies and Unemployment in Morocco: a Quantitative A n a l y ~ i s ” ~ ’
had considerable impact and helped strengthen the ministry’s capacity to conduct quantitative
studies o f the labor market.
On the other hand, other studies or technical assistance had a more limited impact, in
particular the study o n sources o f growth, w h c h had limited dissemination. The Private
Participation in Infrastructure (PPI) strategy was never carried out.

42
Outcome 2.2. More-dynamic SMEs and services industry (in particular ICT and tourism), leading
to job creation: Partially achieved.

24.

Growth in the ICT sector was dynamic, thanks, in part, to the Bank’s contributions.
The Telecommunications, Post, and Information Technology (1999-2001) and Information
Infrastructure (2001-03) projects led to many positive outcomes: introduction o f competition in the
telecommunications sector, improved regulatory capacity, partial privatization o f Maroc Telecom,
restructuring o f the Moroccan postal system, and increased access o f rural and poor communities to
telecommunication services. In 1999, Meditel paid US$1.1 b i l l i o n for a second G S M (cellular)
license, resulting in one o f the largest sales in the world and increased fiscal revenues (13 percent).
A s a result o f these programs, cellular lines have grown to 7.5 m i l l i o n in 2004; tens o f thousands o f
direct and indirect jobs have been created; and the postal system has increased its profitability, posting
i t s first profits in 2000. I F C invested US$79 m i l l i o n in Meditel, which enabled the company to attract
nearly US$400 m i l l i o n o f financing from foreign banks.

25.
Other sectors supported by the Bank (tourism, SMEs) experienced more limited growth.
As part of the Sustainable Coastal Tourism Development project, many public-private partnerships
supporting sustainable and integrated development o f coastal tourism sites were tested, and a
regulatory framework for such contracts i s being finalized. The Cultural Heritage Strategy Note, while
offering a good evaluation o f the stakes involved (and rated satisfactory by QAG), had very little
impact because the recommendations were not implemented and the study was not made public.
S M E support was conducted by IFC through the N o r t h Africa Enterprise Development Program
(NAED). It i s still too early to measure the impact o f NAED’s activities, which include technical
assistance to build financial institution capacity t o better serve SMEs; technical assistance to
strengthen professional associations in industrial zones; and IFC’s US$5 m i l l i o n investment in Maroc
Invest (an investment fund for SMEs). However, NAED has designed performance indicators that will
allow results t o be monitored in coming years. The Bank’s PSD I11 Vocational Training project
(1997-2003) reached i t s development objective. It increased business demand for employee
professional development and corporate training in the workplace (in particular withm SMEs) and
supported the emergence o f centers o f excellence in professional development. The number o f people
who received training in the workplace increased from 27,000 in 1996 t o 133,000 in 2002.
Outcome 2.3. Improved investment climatefor the private sector: Partially achieved.

26.
Although progress was made toward improving the investment climate in Morocco, the
Bank’s contribution was limited. This outcome was part o f the “sector reform program” component
of the C A S base case scenario, yet a reform loan was not prepared during the period because the
triggers (that is, establishment o f a broad PPI framework and streamlined business environment) were
not met. T h e Bank’s involvement was confined to several studies and a sole project: the Legal and
Judicial Development project, w h c h has just closed after achieving its development objectives.
Tribunals and trade registers are functioning better, and this has l e d to better service quality, the
reduction o f delays, and easier access to information. The studies provided a rigorous analysis o f the
obstacles that firms face and sparked a debate between different govemment stakeholders and the
business world. A few studies seem to have l e d to positive changes, though t h s i s difficult to
demonstrate. The Firm Analysis and Competitiveness Survey i s said t o have encouraged important
reforms in the labor l a w (to make the labor market more flexible), in the liberalization o f certain
sectors such as telecommunications and transport, and in the design o f regional investment centers.
Outcome 2.4. Reduced distortions in the agricultural incentives system: Not achieved, but
preparatory work is under way.

43

27.
While this outcome was only partially achieved, important progress has been made in
identifying the key challenges and implementing certain reforms. The Bank’s programmatic
economic and sector work (PESW) on agriculture reform l e d to the following results: options for deprotection o f the agnculture sector have been analyzed; progressive abolition o f flour subsidies i s
under way; analysis i s being undertaken to assess whether food subsidies or other assistance programs
should b e implemented for the poor and whether direct support t o farmers affected by the reform
would be warranted as a temporary measure. However, certain difficult choices have yet t o be made.
For example, the C A S included a monitoring indicator under pillar 111, w h i c h has been only partially
achieved: the removal o f consumer subsidy systems in key agricultural products. The Bank’s PESW
seems t o have been the best way to support reform as it allowed for the delivery o f regular analytical
and technical assistance, in response to specific demand. The sector reform program that was
envisioned in the C A S did not materialize, as the trigger (liberalization o f the a p c u l t u r a l pricing
system) was not met.
C. Pillar I11 Outcomes: Reducedvulnerability of the poors’ income and consumption to
droughts

28.
This pillar was aligned with the Plan’s goals of reducing agricultural vulnerability and
environmental threats, but performance indicator targets were not reached. I t aimed t o help the
government reform agricultural incentives, stop environmental degradation, and build consensus for a
more sustainable and equitable global policy o f using scarce water resources. Performance indicators
(Table 7) show improvement in water cost recovery, although below target, and deterioration in
public expenditure o n social assistance programs. In addition, there was an important shift between
the instruments actually used in implementing the pillar and those projected (Table 8).

Outcome 3.1. Progress in improving social safety nets and social protection: Not achieved.

29.

Performance and monitoring indicators show that little progress has been made and the
CAS outcome was not reached. Public spending o n social assistance programs did not attain the 1.2
percent o f GDP projected-and even decreased from its 2000 level, amounting to only 0.37 percent o f
GDP in 2004. The monitoring indicator for this outcome-xtended
coverage o f social assistance
programs-was also not reached. Though the Bank conducted fairly r i c h analytical work during t h s
period, the analysis did not accelerate implementation o f a social protection system. The Bank’s note
o n social protection introduced a new approach, emphasizing integrated management o f social,
economic, and environmental risk for poor and vulnerable groups. However, QAG rated the report

44
marginally satisfactory because follow-up was laclung and dissemination limited. The 2004 Poverty
Report highlighted the need for social protection programs to accompany the reform o f cereals
compensation and offered recommendations for implementation. Overall, few actions were taken by
government to implement these recommendations, notably those regarding a social protection
framework aligned with the poverty reduction strategy and financial sustainability.

Outcome 3.2. Improved water management through better utilization methods and full cost
recovery: Partially achieved.

30.
Based on indicators identified for the irrigation sector, this outcome was only partially
achieved. Cost recovery rates for water in the nine large-scale imgation areas ranged from 62 percent
in 2000 to 76 percent in 2003 (in the seven areas that charged for water). However, t h s percentage
was w e l l below the 90 percent rate projected. The tariff adjustment program recommended by the

45
Bank in 2000 was implemented, and consequently, irrigation water tariffs were sufficient t o cover
operation and maintenance costs in five o f the seven Regional Agricultural Development Authorities
(Offices Regionaux de Mise en Valeur Agricole) in 2004.

3 1.
T h e Bank suggested a reform process to help improve the quality a n d sustainability of
water services in large-scale irrigation areas, but these reforms are unimplemented. Institutional
reforms proposed by the Bank’s Programmatic ESW-namely the delegation o f irrigation services in
large-scale irrigation areas to private operators-were validated by government, w h i c h has requested
Bank support for their implementation. In tandem, the Bank and I F C provided the government with
technical assistance o n structuring and implementing a public-private partnership (PPP) for the
construction and operation o f the irrigated perimeter o f Guerdane (10,000 hectares). In August 2004,
a private operator was selected through international competitive bidding, representing one o f the first
irrigation PPPs in the world. The project will increase the availability o f irrigation water for about 600
citrus producers, thereby increasing and stabilizing their production and revenues. I t i s estimated that
the Guerdane irrigation perimeter will generate direct and indirect revenues for more than 10,000
people.

32.

I n the urban water supply and sanitation sub-sector, tariff collection is still inadequate
and the related financial constraints have limited the performance o f water agencies. The Water
Supply V project closed in 2002 and was rated unsatisfactory in terms o f institutional sustainability
and results. The operational and institutional performance o f the water agencies showed a slight
improvement due to the privatization o f drinking-water and sanitation services in Casablanca and
Rabat. However, financial and operational efficiency showed little improvement: the water agencies
and National Potable Water Office (ONEP) were unable to l i m i t arrears, and water tariffs were not
adjusted in line with the established schedule. M a n y environmental and rural components were
cancelled. In fact, the project design was overly ambitious since it strived t o support water supply and
sanitation services in six cities, ONEP, three ministries, and eleven implementing agencies. However,
the Sewerage and Water Reuse I1 project i s o n track and will most likely acheve its development
goals by the end of June 2005. Investments in collectors and connections to the sewerage systems will
provide better environmental protection and improved public health. Fez’s water supply and sanitation
agency, RADEF, was also able to increase i t s institutional capacity and tariffs, but the project has
shown less success in reducing arrears and water losses.

33.
Effective water sector strategies were developed with B a n k support. The Water Resources
Management project led to the development o f an institutional framework for integrated water
resources management, including the National Water Plan (the core o f the national water sector
strategy), the National Water Quality Protection Plan, the National Flood Plan, and recommendations
o n water pricing. There have also been improvements in the institutional capacity o f the ministry in
charge o f water. A k v e r Basin Agency was set up in the Oum-er-Rbia, w h i c h should be fully
operational this year once the necessary legal and financial tools t o fulfill i t s obligations under the
1995 Water L a w are in place. A s such, the project can be said t o have acheved its development
objective to “assist the government in providing a comprehensive water management strategy that is
economically efficient, equitable, and environmentally sustainable.” In addition, at the request o f
government, the Bank prepared a series o f Water Sector Notes in 2004 aimed at consolidating the
sector’s analytic tools through specific reform recommendations to maximize economic impact.
Outcome 3.3. Law on environmental protection and Law on evaluation of environmental impacts
implemented: Achieved

34.
This goal was reached, with the two cited laws in force since 2002. Both laws were
prepared with the W o r l d Bank’s assistance prior to the CAS, which explains why they were adopted
as monitoring indicators. Environmental legislative protection n o w extends t o activities undertaken in
Morocco, including those financed by the Bank.

46

35.
The Bank’s impact on the environment has been rather limited during the CAS, but it
has led to government agencies adopting new tools to measure the cost of environmental
degradation. The study o n the Cost o f Environmental Degradation was used by the Ministry o f
Environment t o assess damages in the Sebou basin and in Tangier. In addition, environmental
safeguards are implemented more systematically and environmental issues have been mainstreamed
into most o f the Bank’s activities. The Bank has also trained key stakeholders in environmental
impact analysis. However, such efforts will need to be sustained in the years ahead to maintain
environmental focus in projects. Finally, the Protected Areas Management GEF project i s reaching i t s
development goals, which include improved conservation o f the ecosystem and endangered species,
creation o f a network o f protected areas, as well as strengthened institutional capacity for sustainable
development and conservation. A biodiversity survey shows that conservation and protection o f
species has improved in the three parks included in the project.
D. Pillar I V Outcomes: Improved Public Governance

36.
This pillar was aligned with the Plan goal to reform the state. The objective o f this pillar
was to continue the dialogue with government o n governance, while recognizing the incremental
nature o f the process as i t required much consensus building. The only performance indicator for this
pillar was not achleved (Table 9). Outcome results were greater in some cases (public adrmnistration
reform) but less so in others (municipal development and decentralization). Overall, the activities
undertaken were o f the kind proposed in the CAS, namely analytical work, policy dialogue, and pilot
institutional activities t o test approaches o n a limited scale (see Table IO).

Outcome 4.1. Progress toward improved governance: Some steps taken.

37.
The CAS expected gradual improvements in governance due to the required consensus
building, and this i s what materialized. Even though it i s difficult to specify a l l the progress made
and the Bank’s role in thls, i t can be said that governance i s more easily discussed in Morocco than
before and that there i s a stronger consensus o n the centrality o f governance for development. In
addition, governance has been gradually integrated into Bank activities (private and public sector, and
civil society). Ths general approach was probably more effective and sustainable than the
undertakmg o f specific governance activities (such as a Governance LIL), w h c h w o u l d have been too
sensitive.
38.
The governance focus adopted in many Bank activities helped advance the dialogue on
several fronts. The most notable breakthroughs are the support for N G O s and Parliamentarians as
part o f the Governance and c i v i l society w o r k (see Outcome 4.5); recommendations o n improving
corporate governance included in the ROSC; analysis o f the transparency o f financial markets
conducted within the FSAP; strengthening o f the judicial system (Legal and Judicial Development
project); progress in public sector governance as part o f the public administration and budget reforms;
improved transparency, credibility, and efficiency o f public procurement practices; assessment o f
systems to prevent money laundering and the financing o f terrorism; etc.

Outcome 4.2. Public administration and public sector modernized and rationalized: Partially
achieved.
39.
Significant progress was made in modernization of both public administration and the
public sector. W i t h support of the Bank and the European Union, the government has started
implementing an ambitious program to improve the efficiency o f public expenditure by decentralizing
(d&concentration) and improving accountability o f regonal and local governments, as well as
rationalizing human resource management and ensuring sustainability o f fiscal accounts. This reform
i s supported by a programmatic adjustment loan, the PARI,, which was made possible in 2004
because the B a n k deemed that macroeconomic performance was satisfactory, that the sector specific
trigger had been met (improved incentive framework for c i v i l service), and that the program would
play a major role in improving fiscal sustainability. Although i t i s too early t o assess results, the
simple fact that this operation could be designed demonstrates the government’s commitment to
tackle k e y structural reforms. Ths program should help contain the wage bill, which did not reach the
target o f 10 percent o f GDP in 2004 and actually increased between 2000 and 2003 (12.9 percent).
40.
The Bank played an important role in helping achieve these results. Besides the PARL,
other Bank activities have had considerable impact. The Public Expenditure Review o f 2002 was
conducted in a participatory way with the Moroccan government, raised awareness o f the key
challenges, and led to a willingness t o act o n the reform agenda. This l e d to a request for additional
Bank support, delivered as a PESW o n public administration reformz This program was conceived in a
flexible w a y in order to support policy analysis and change management by providing t e c h c a l
assistance, training, and top-notch expertise in areas o f significant importance. The PESW also
facilitated preparation o f the P a .

Outcome 4.3. Greater decentralization and enhanced municipal development: Not achieved.
41.
Neither outcome was achieved, especially greater decentralization. The C A S monitoring
indicator, which was to reach agreement o n the fiamework for decentralization and participation in
key rural programs, was not attained. Yet t h s indicator does not appear to have been the most reliable
measure o f progress, as most Bank activities supported decentralization in urban areas. Nonetheless,
the sectoral triggers that w o u l d have l e d to a sector reform program were unmet: effective
decentralization o f accountability and decision-making, and actions to improve local government’
capacity for financial management. The Bank’s Decentralization and Municipal Management study
(considered satisfactory by QAG) had limited dissemination and thus limited impact. The PESW o n
decentralization, which was scheduled to last several years in order to accompany implementation o f
reforms, was stopped after only a year because the vision for reform was insufficiently articulated.
Decentralization i s an area in which the Bank could bring added value, but the impact has been
limited by lack o f clarity in the government’s reform process.
42.
Important progress has been made in municipal development and urban housing. The
Municipal Finance I1 project acheved i t s development objectives since i t more than doubled the
number o f anticipated infrastructure projects built in small and medium-size cities, mostly benefiting
small municipalities whose l o w fiscal revenues w o u l d never have facilitated such construction. On the
other hand, the institutional impact o f the project was modest since it did n o t include (at the
government’s request) components t o strengthen municipal capacity. In addition, the Fonds
d’Equipement Communal (FEC) was not transformed into a Joint Stock Company, w h i c h w o u l d have
given it a high level of autonomy. The Fes Medina Rehabilitation project seems able to reach i t s
development objectives despite serious difficulties in implementation. The T e c h c a l Assistance o n
Housing improved dialogue o n different aspects o f reform, in particular housing finance, and a sector
reform loan i s currently being prepared to support implementation.

49

Outcome 4.4. Improved budget management: Partially achieved.

43.
Though this outcome was broadly defined, with no performance indicators to support
an assessment, it can be said to have been partially achieved, with the Bank playing a role in the
outcome. T h e government has started introducing performance-based budgeting, following the
recommendations o f the PER. Though it i s s t i l l in i t s early stages and has not yet produced tangible
results, the reform has been successfully launched and i s supported by the PARL, the PESW on
Public Administration Reform, and an IDF grant that supports pilot reform by strengthening the
capacity o f managers in the Ministry o f Finance and other selected ministries. Other activities have
also contributed to t h s result: the Asset Management Adjustment L o a n has helped improve efficiency
of public education and health expenditures by implementing an efficient asset management system;
the C F A A recommended important changes to improve public financial management; the JDF grant
for budget management achieved its objectives, as the key agencies were reorganized t o be more
efficient and steps are being taken to align national accounts w i t h international standards; finally, the
IDF grant o n the capacity o f government audit succeeded in strengthening the public auditing agency
(Inspection Ge‘nkrale des Finances).

Outcome 4.5. Strengthened civil society: Partially achieved.

44.
Though civil society played an increasingly important role during this CAS, Bank
activities contributed only partially to strengthening NGO capacity. The Bank focused o n
improving i t s knowledge o f civil society in Morocco in order to develop a more constructive dialogue
with c i v i l society organizations and identify their needs. In a second stage, the Bank set up a few
programs to build their capacity. In addition to work conducted o n gender with NGOs (see Outcome
1.4) and partnerships forged as part o f decentralization projects (Pillar I)the
, major results under t h s
outcome are as follows:
The work o n governance and c i v i l society took stock o f the relationshps, links, and legal
framework regulating them between NGOs and government. It also helped identify capacitybuilding needs. Thls activity was rated satisfactory by QAG, mostly for i t s strategic
importance in strengthening relationships and cooperative mechanisms between government
(mainly the decentralized levels) and NGOs, and the Bank’s comparative advantage in acting
as a catalyst between the two sectors.
The governance and c i v i l society program also focused o n strengthening the capacity o f
Parliamentarians, particularly in their role in the budgetary process. This program l e d to
simplifications in h o w the annual budget i s presented as w e l l as improvements in
Parliamentarians’ ability t o monitor public expenditure efficiency.
The small grants program launched in 2002 provided US$40,000 annually t o 160 NGOs for
capacity building. The funds will allow these NGOs to better respond t o the needs o f their
target groups, and improve budget management as w e l l as accountability and internal
govemance.

111. Bank Performance during the CAS Period

A. Volume, lending instruments, and scenarios
45.
Of the 18 projects planned in CAS, only 9 were delivered, and with important
departures in instrument type from what had been anticipated. As in&cated in Appendix Table
3a, only 4 o f the 11 planned sector investment loans were undertaken. Three others were canceled:
Education 2002, Cultural Heritage 2003, and SME/IT 2004. The Integrated Forestry Development
project that was part o f the C A S program i s currently under preparation but has a high chance o f

50
being shelved until the Bank’s strategy o n supporting integrated rural development i s better
articulated. Three projects were implemented but by relying o n different instruments than originally
planned: adjustment loans for the Information Infrastructure Sector and Asset Management, and a
learning and innovation loan (LIL) for Adult Literacy. None o f the five programmed LILs were
undertaken; but the Social Development Agency project, originally planned as an LIL, was
transformed into an investment loan. The C A S emphasis o n LILs turned out t o be misguided because
this instrument has proven to be expensive to prepare and supervise, and the intensive leaming that i s
sought can b e obtained as well within the framework o f larger projects. Only one adaptable program
loan (APL) was approved (the first phase o f DRI-PMH), and a first sector-wide approach (SWAP)
was undertaken in 2004 (PAFX). While two sector reform programs were planned, only one was
implemented: the PARL, which has been designed as a programmatic adjustment operation with a
series of annual loans. Eighteen projects closed during the C A S period, indicating a rapid reduction in
the size o f the Bank’s portfolio in Morocco.
46.
T h e volume o f loans was significantly lower than had been anticipated in the CAS, in
part because Morocco remained in the base case (core program scenario) for most o f the period
and only became eligible for sector reform programs in 2004. The C A S forecasted a base case
scenario of US$lOO-l50 m i l l i o n per year for investment projects and L I L s and US$100 m i l l i o n per
year for sector adjustment loans or programmatic loans. The total volume o f investment lending
delivered was US$215.3 m i l l i o n over four years, averaging US$53.8 m i l l i o n per year and a total o f
US$210 million for sectoral adjustment loans. As described in paragraph 6 above, i t was not until
2004 that the Bank deemed the fiscal triggers allowing loans for sectoral reform programs had been
met, and approved preparation o f an operation to support public administration reform. The hgh-case
scenario permitted a loan o f US$250-450 million, consisting o f the base case plus programmatic
support a n d o r targeted interventions to reduce the costs o f adjustment. Ths scenario was never met.
47.
T h e gap between the planned lending program and what was delivered can be explained
b y several reasons: difficulty in predetermining a lending program for a sophisticated middleincome country with rapidly evolving needs, a high level of dropped projects, a n d decreasing
demand for B a n k services in view of alternative sources of financing. The Bank’s experience in
middle-income countries demonstrates that because o f their rapidly evolving needs, it i s extremely
difficult t o predetermine what the lending program will l o o k like. As a result, the Bank n o w advocates
greater flexibility in designing lending programs, and the new C A S will take advantage o f t h s .
During the C A S period, most projects in the lending program were initiated and underwent some level
of preparation before being dropped. T h s resulted in significant losses since the Bank spent
approximately US$2 m i l l i o n o n dropped projects, equivalent t o more than a third o f the overall
preparation costs during this period. Morocco ranks second in the Middle East and N o r t h Africa
region for the cost o f dropped projects. Moreover, the loan amounts for several projects were
signlficantly reduced during negotiations. The following reasons help explain why projects were
dropped or reduced: government identified cheaper sources o f funds to finance the program (EU,
Arab funds, etc); over optimism by the Bank team about the institutional capacity o f implementing
agencies in Morocco or the degree o f advancement o f certain reforms; instruments that were too
costly or poorly adapted to needs (LILs); and restricted ability to design sector reform loans because
of the triggers identified in the CAS, even though these loans better met the Moroccan demand. It i s
interesting to note that during preparation o f dropped projects the Bank also supported some
important reforms without this resulting in a loan. There are many important lessons that can be
learned from this experience in order to minimize project preparation costs in the next C A S period
and improve the Bank’s responsiveness to Moroccan demand.
B. Portfolio Quality
48.
After a net improvement in the quality o f the portfolio in fiscal 2002, the quality
subsequently declined in fiscal 2003 and 2004. The percentage o f projects at risk went f r o m 6
percent in fiscal 2002 t o 17 percent in fiscal 2004, as did the percentage o f problem projects (Table
11). This i s explained by several causes: projects that were too ambitious in their design or scope (that

51
is, the capacity o f implementing agencies was overestimated), projects too quickly prepared to meet
end- of-fiscal-year deadlines, and problems with implementation due to complex institutional design.
The realism and proactivity indices were hgh, demonstrating that issues in at-risk projects were
quickly resolved or the projects were quickly downgraded to problem projects, and that when t h s
occurred, task teams took the necessary measures to address the problems.

Overall, the quality at entry and the quality of supervision o f projects was good.
According to QAG, three o f the four projects .rated o n quality at entry during the C A S period had
satisfactory ratings. Only one (Adult Literacy) was rated unsatisfactory o n technical and economic
analyses, institutional aspects, and analysis o f risks and sustainability. O f the eight projects assessed
o n quality o f supervision, six were rated satisfactory and t w o unsatisfactory (Fes Medina
Rehabilitation project, and Health Financing and Management project). It can b e concluded that o n
the whole, despite some shortcomings, the Bank performed well in preparation and supervision.
50.
T h e disbursement ratio averaged 18 percent during the first three years covered by CAS,
but dropped to 10.3 percent in fiscal 2004 (Table 9). The disbursement ratio lagged behind
implementation o f physical infrastructure because the payment system and the use o f special accounts
were slow and inefficient and because staff f i o m project units lacked training in procurement,
disbursements, and financial management. The disbursement ratio for projects in the portfolio the
longest was particularly low: GEF Protected Areas Management (24.4 percent after four years),
Health Management (12.6 percent after more than five years), etc. The projects that are highly
decentralized (such as the integrated rural development projects) suffered the most f r o m complex
payment and procurement systems and seem to be poorly adapted to community-type works.
5 1.
T h e portfolio i s characterized by implementation and effectiveness delays. During the
C A S period, 14 projects out o f 25 were extended by at least 12 months, several for up t o 36 months,
and some were extended twice. Despite this, the average age o f Morocco’s portfolio (3.8 years)
matches the Bank average (3.5 years) and the average for the MENA region (3.8 years) during fiscal
years 2001-04. The project extensions are explained by delays in project implementation, often due to
cumbersome bureaucratic procedures and payment systems or t o poor project design and preparation.
Indeed, the average delay between Board approval and effectiveness i s 11 months. One reason for the
delay i s that govemment does not s i g n loan agreements until the project i s in the budget for the new
fiscal year, in order to avoid paying commission fees until the project i s ready to be launched with
counterpart funding. Another reason i s that some projects were not ready for implementation at the
time o f Board approval or were poorly designed. Following the country portfolio performance
reviews (CPPR) conducted during the CAS period, some actions were taken t o speed up the
implementation and effectiveness o f projects, but more remains t o be done.
52.
The average project preparation cost for Morocco was considerably higher than the
average cost for the region and for the Bank. Indeed, for the nine projects approved during the

52
C A S period, the average preparation cost per US$l,OOO o f lending was US$10.50, equivalent t o 50
percent higher than the average for the MENA region and two-and-a-half times the average
preparation cost for Bank projects. The small size o f projects in Morocco (US$9.4 m i l l i o n o n average
versus US$59.8 m i l l i o n for the region and US$80.3 m i l l i o n for the Bank) largely explains this hgh
cost. The previously cited high droppage rate o f projects in the preparation stage also i s important.

C. M A Program
53.
Analytical and advisory activities (AAA) played a key role in CAS implementation, and
the quality o f the program was rated satisfactory. A country assessment o f these activities
conducted by QAG at the end o f 2004 concluded that the Bank i s the donor agency that produces the
most analytical work in Morocco and that the quality o f this w o r k i s lllghly appreciated by
government. T h e government sees the Bank’s added value in providing high-quality analysis and
expertise and in playing a catalytic role. The increasingly participatory nature o f E S W has l e d to
more-extensive consultations and greater ownershp o f the recommendations o f various studies by the
key stakeholders. QAG rated the program satisfactory in the following areas: strategic relevance,
internal quality, coherence and integration, and likely impact. The Bank’s w o r k was rated marginally
satisfactory o n Bank inputs and processes and o n dialogue and dissemination. Although efforts were
made during the C A S period t o improve dissemination o f AAA, only some activities were widely
disseminated and debated. Dialogue and dissemination remains an area where improvements can be
made during implementation o f the new CAS.

54.
The four programmatic economic and sector works (PESWS)~’introduced as pilots
during the CAS period have proven to be suitable approaches to supporting reforms and
strengthening institutional capacities. Because PESWs are funded over several years, they can
respond flexibly to demand and mobilize quality expertise, and are therefore a very useful tool to
accompany complex reform processes. However, for PESWs t o effectively play their role, i t i s
important to obtain the government’s formal commitment to them, with a clear identification of
expected outcomes, performance indicators, triggers, and exit strategies. This formal commitment has
not always been obtained. The experience o f the PESW o n public administration reform indicates the
challenges that exist in carrying out a loan preparation and supervision in tandem with a PESW, as the
PESW almost always takes second place.
I V . CAS Performance Summary Evaluation

55.
T h s section evaluates C A S performance according to the following principles identified in
the strategy-selectivity,
partnerships, knowledge transfer and institution building, and expanded role
of the Country office-as
w e l l as other important criteria such as the sustainability o f CAS
achievements, assessment and mitigation o f risks, and borrower performance.
Selectivity

56.
Although CAS emphasized the need for greater selectivity in the choice of Bank
activities, the formulation of the actual strategy did not encourage selectivity and gave rise to an
expansion of activities. The C A S identified 17 areas o f support (expected outcomes), a h g h number
for a C A S stressing the importance o f selectivity. The number o f activities carried out was also high,
resulting in a fragmented approach, w i t h a quite high share o f small activities having limited impact.
Moreover, the CAS was not effectively used as a management and decision-making tool. Numerous
activities were included in the program during implementation, w h i c h w o u l d not have been the case if
the program had been managed with selectivity in mind.
Sustainability of CAS Outcomes and InstitutionalImpact

32

The four PESWs are agriculture and irrigation, h g h e r education, public administration reform, and poverty.

53
57.
The sustainability of CAS outcomes i s rated likely, and the institutional impact, modest.
According t o the Operations Evaluation Department (OED), 60 percent o f the loans that closed in
Morocco between fiscal 1993 and fiscal 2003 are rated likely t o be sustainable in the long t e r m (Table
12). Of the 14 projects that closed during the C A S period and were reviewed by
11 were rated
as being likely sustainable. In analyzing the 17 C A S outcomes, the sustainability o f results seems high
in a number o f important areas since it i s unlikely that there will be a halt or reversal o f the reform
process. On the other hand, only 37 percent o f projects have an institutional impact that can be
considered substantial. Ths means that only one-third o f projects contribute to improving Morocco’s
capacity to utilize i t s human, financial, and natural resources more efficiently, equitably, and
sustainably. Nevertheless, the impact o f the AAA program i s rated by QAG as satisfactory (see
above). Several analytical pieces have led to policy changes, greater consensus o n the reform agenda,
and a r i c h exchange o f knowledge. The emphasis placed by t h s C A S o n knowledge transfer and
institutional strengthening was adequate, and that focus should be maintained in the next C A S period.

Assessment and Mitigation of Risks

58.
The main risks were adequately identified in the CAS, and their mitigation strategy was
appropriate. The main risk identified was related t o possible degradation o f the fiscal and extemal
position and the economic performance. The Bank’s mitigation strategy consisted o f a strong
reduction o f exposure by requiring strong fiscal adjustment and sectoral triggers for support t o sector
reforms. From the point o f view o f risk management, this strategy was prudent. But it also had the
downside o f removing the Bank’s flexibility in supporting some k e y sector reforms. The C A S deemed
that political risks would be limited, which tumed out to be the case. The C A S predicted that
worsening economic conditions, resulting in large youth unemployment, could bring heightened
social tensions. The terrorist attacks in Casablanca in M a y 2003 were evidence that this risk was real.
Although economic policies favorable to growth were implemented during the C A S period, they were
not sufficient to generate strong growth and reduce unemployment and inequality rates.
Expanded Role o f the Bank’s Country Office, of Outreach, and o f Partnerships

59.
The strengthening of the Bank’s country office in Rabat, of partnerships, and of
outreach activities, as suggested in the CAS, was accomplished. The Bank and I F C country offices
played a strategic role in strengthening the Bank’s dialogue with the government and other
development partners. The presence o f the office enriched partnerships with donor agencies and
33

facilitated co-financing o f activities (for example, with the EU for PARL and with the AfBD for the
telecommunications project). However, coordination between development partners was below
expectations and insufficiently articulated with the government’s program.34 Partnershps w i t h civil
society, the private sector, and the media were strengthened, as demonstrated by the fruitful and
numerous consultations held during preparation o f the new CAS. During the CAS period, the Bank
office implemented a communications strategy to promote the Bank’s missions and activities and
relied o n the following instruments: an Internet site and a regular newsletter in French, dissemination
o f B a n k analytical work, creation o f six Public Information Centers, a series o f conferences, among
others. T h s highlights the real benefits o f the Bank Group’s decentralization.

Borrower Performance
60.
Overall, borrower performance was good, although there were some areas for
improvement. O f the 14 projects closed during the C A S period and reviewed by OED, the
performance o f the borrower was satisfactory in 10 cases, indicating that the government had
adequately put in place the human, financial, and t e c h c a l resources needed for project
implementation. The overall coordination function carried out by the Ministry o f General and
Economic Affairs (MAEG) and the Ministry o f Finance was also satisfactory. However, there were
some shortcomings, which include 1) the lack o f appropriate solutions to resolve the systemic issues
that have hampered portfolio performance, in particular slow implementation and l o w disbursement
ratios due to cumbersome payment systems and administrative procedures; 2) problems o f integration
and coordination in the implementation o f certain projects, in particular multisectoral programs such
as integrated rural development projects; and 3) the difficulty in reachng a consensus about and
managing implementation o f certain key reforms.

V. Key Considerations for the Next CAS
61.
I t i s recommended that the next CAS adopt a results focus that will allow for greater
selectivity. The CAS should identify the expected outcomes and the performance indicators to
measure progress. This will allow the country team to focus o n managing for results and to be
selective in choosing activities, zeroing in o n those that can have a positive impact o n results.
Expected outcomes would be used as a filter in activity selection, w h i c h will eliminate activities that
do not directly contribute to the achievement o f results. The C A S would become a better strategic
management tool, geared toward improving the Bank’s results by relying o n annual implementation
reviews to assess progress made o n outcomes and o n performance o f the loan and AAA portfolios.
The next CAS will benefit from the flexibility now offered by the World Bank to middle62.
income countries. The C A S under review was very complex because o f the various lending scenarios
and multiple triggers. W h i l e this responded to concerns about managing the Bank’s exposure, it was
constraining and did not allow the Bank to respond flexibly t o Morocco’s needs. The new Bank
approach allows lending scenarios to be much more flexible, which will certainly benefit Morocco.
The lending program and AAA will not be determined in advance, knowing that they are susceptible
to important changes during the period.
The choice of instruments should focus more on programmatic loans and development
63.
policy loans, while relying on a realistic assessment of implementationcapacities. The difficulties
experienced in the implementation o f the loan portfolio during the C A S period demonstrate the l i m i t s
of investment loans (hgh transaction costs, implementation delays, weak institutional impact, etc).
Thus, it i s recommended that the n e w C A S emphasize programmatic loans such as sector wide
approaches (SWAPS), which rely more heavily o n country systems. I t i s also recommended that more
of the Bank’s financial transfers be done through sector reform programs since these instruments
allow for substantial transfers with m u c h reduced transaction costs. They do, however, require
aligning the Bank’s efforts w i t h the pace o f reform in the country, conducting adequate assessments
34

The QAG study on the AAA emphasised the lack o f coordination between donors in analytical work.

55
o f the implementation capacity o f the participating agencies, and proposing institution-building
programs to remedy the lack o f capacity in some areas.
64.
T h e impact o f the Bank’s activities, and in particular o f analytical work, could be
enhanced b y continuing to strengthen outreach and dissemination efforts. The Quality Assurance
Group’s AAA assessment indicates that studies with the greatest impact and lughest implementation
of recommendations are those that were developed in a participatory manner, provoked debate, and
were widely disseminated. During the period o f the CAS, it is strongly advised that much stronger
emphasis be placed o n dialogue and dissemination o f the AAA program. This will require identifying
from the very inception o f AAA work a plan for consultation and distribution. It will also require
management to dedicate considerably more attention to this process. Similar opportunities could be
identified in the lending portfolio. To this end, the outreach program run f r o m the Rabat office should
be reinforced. In order to allow the Bank to provide more effective support, it i s recommended that
the Bank conduct more frequent stakeholder analyses, which will help understand who the key players
are and what their positions are vis-a-vis the proposed reforms. This is important in a country where
the decision-making process i s complex and building consensus for change i s challenging because o f
the large number o f stakeholder groups.

65.
Some B a n k approaches, in particular support for the decentralization process and
integrated r u r a l development, should be refined during the next CAS period. It would be useful
to clarify and communicate the objectives o f integrated rural development projects and to determine to
what extent these projects could be continued or scaled-up in a context in which the government’s
own strategy o n decentralization has not been fully articulated. Thls i s fundamental if these projects
are going t o b e models promoting community participation and the reinforcement o f fiscal
decentralization and local integration. It i s also necessary to create links between these projects and
the dialogue o n the decentralization framework (deconcentrution) supported by the public
administration reform loan and by programmatic economic and sector work.

CAS Annex 4: CAS Consultations
1.
In agreement with the Moroccan government and to build political buy-in and collect substantive
information on various visions o f Morocco’s development priorities, the preparation o f this C A S was
based on broad consultations.

2.
Given the complex transition that Morocco has been undergoing in recent years, as well as the
development challenges i t faces, the premises for a dialogue have emerged at various levels and in
different sectors between a dynamic c i v i l society and decision makers. The latter are increasingly
convinced o f the need to open up this dialogue to all socioeconomic actors. This unique opportunity in the
Middle East and North Africa region has allowed the launch o f wide consultations, encouraging local
ownership o f the C A S since i t s first conceptual phases.
3.
In the launching and throughout implementation o f the consultative process, the Bank’s team took
into consideration the diversity o f development actors while respecting the modalities o f their
interactions. The consultations targeted all stakeholders and produced a constructive dialogue focused
around the country’s crucial development challenges. Meetings began in June 2004 and were structured
through t w o phases: the f i r s t on the national level, and the second o n the sectoral level, focusing o n
priority sectors identified during the f i r s t phase.
4.
Consultations in the first phase targeted national public
and private sector representatives as well as various civil society
components and networks, such as NGOs, parliamentarians,
academics, and professional associations. I t focused on crosssectoral issues linked to the country’s main development
challenges. Primary recommendations f r o m the aforementioned
constituencies l e d to the identification o f priority development
sectors. However, i t i s important to mention that these priorities
do not exhaust all o f the development issues discussed nor all the
ideas and options proposed in this first phase o f consultations.
Rather they represent those ideas that were strongly supported
and around which there was significant convergence. They also
were considered in light o f the W o r l d Bank’s ability to respond
in terms of i t s m i x o f expertise and instruments. The views that
emerged are reflected in the CAS and consist o f the following
axes:

targeted all stakeholders and
produced a constructive
dialogue focused around the
country’s crucial development
questions. Consultations not
only allowed an engagement in
a constructive dialogue with the
Bank, but they also reinforced
the dialogue among local
stakeholders, thus helping to
refine their strategic vision of
the country’s development.

Sustainable economic growth
Poverty reduction
Development o f human capital
Sustainable management o f water

5.
Despite the fact that these first-phase consultations clarified perceptions about the priorities and
strategic options for Morocco’s development, debates o n the means and actions for achieving such
development goals were at times passionate. Participants’ comments were generally marked by a sense o f
emergency for the launch or the acceleration o f necessary reforms. Therefore, consultations in this phase
not only allowed engagement in a constructive dialogue with the Bank, but also reinforced the dialogue
among local stakeholders, thus helping t o refine their strategic vision o f the country’s development.

66
6.
Based o n the above-mentioned four main strategc goals, the second phase o f consultations
targeted development constituencies on a sectoral level. These consultations were led in collaboration
with the Ministry o f General Affairs in order to strengthen counterpart ownership o f the process.
However, particular focus was put on the education, water, and social development sectors, which were
subject to more-substantive consultation sessions that involved all stakeholders either separately or in
general sessions. This approach allowed fuller understanding o f the complex development issues in these
sectors, which have a transversal dimension and are among the most challenging for Morocco’s
development.

7.

Finally, although the two-phase process was laborious, the exchange o f ideas among diverse
development actors encouraged their progressive conceptual ownership o f the CAS. These consultations
were also enriched by the dialogue conducted by the Bank teams with counterparts on different areas o f
the country’s development.

Main Consultation Comments and Outcomes

1. Civil Society Consultation
9.
The f i r s t C A S consultation was a roundtable held with representatives from c i v i l society. These
participants were nationally active in various domains, including local development, civic engagement,
rural development, women’s rights, and academia, as well as the private sector. The following priorities
were discussed during these consultations:

Encouraging human development through continuing economic growth and good governance
Supporting the private sector not only through buttressing economic growth, but also through
raising awareness about social and environmental issues
Making educational reform a top priority, paying particular attention to quality and non-formal
education
Supporting justice, not only in the commercial sector but in all legal domains covered by the
Moroccan judicial system
Analyzing decentralization measures, especially their effects o n development and ongoing
reforms.
I

Participants also highlighted the importance o f the
Bank being selective in the initiatives i t undertakes by
identifying specific development mechanisms that have
multidimensional impact, such as improved govemance.
They, for example stressed that promoting good governance
should be a key feature o f the Bank’s approach to working in
different
sectors, particularly in education, finance,
decentralization, and NGO financial transparency. They felt
that successful reform in any sector depended o n h o w good
governance i s promoted, monitored, and measured.

SuccessJicl reform in any sector
depends on how good governance is

measured .... Actions to improve
governance must be
multidimensional and uphold all
development priorities. Institutional
reform and good governance should
be taken into account when planning
and implementing all World Bank
projects.

67

11.
Moreover, the debate highlighted the need to review the strategy and master plan for
decentralization, using the Commune as an entry point because o f its primary role in local development.
Participants urged the Bank to support the govemment and other development actors in the formulation o f
a coherent overall decentralization strategy.

2. Public Sector Consultation
12.
This consultation, which followed various meetings and working sessions with counterparts from
the Finance and General Affairs Ministries, focused o n discussing their vision o f the country’s strategic
development and stressed the following priorities:
0

0

0

The country’s two main development priorities are sustainable economic growth and
development o f social solidarity.
Reducing social vulnerability and establishing a coherent policy to reduce poverty are
important priorities; however, measures t o accomplish them should not impede continued
economic growth.
Governance work must be multidimensional and uphold all development priorities.
Consequently, institutional reform and governance should be taken into account when planning
and implementing all World Bank projects.
Good govemance and poverty reduction are closely linked and all other Bank activities should
uphold these values.

3. Consultations with Parliament
Talks with Parliamentarians highlighted the following priorities: education, justice, and the
13.
modemization o f public administration:

A balance should be found between economic and social priorities so that the fruits o f
economic growth are more evenly distributed.
Reforms aiming at reducing poverty should focus o n the different vulnerable segments o f the
population.
Private sector growth should be encouraged and stimulated, though not pushed beyond i t s
capacity through public assistance programs.
Public administration needs to be streamlined, and accountability and transparency
strengthened.
Public expenditure procedures must be reviewed, as w e l l as the finance law’s nomenclature.
Decentralization measures should be strengthened as part o f a coherent strategic vision.

68

14.
Roundtable discussions with the General Confederation of
Moroccan Enterprises (CGEM) and the Professional Group o f
Moroccan Banks (GPBM) were organized at the C G E M with
representatives f r o m different banks and business federations.

15.
Debates primarily focused on the urgent need to strengthen
the Moroccan economy. Participants stressed that Moroccan
businesses need support to ensure successful integration into the
world economy. The principal constraints on economic growth
were, according to participants, current nontransparent practices
and procedures in the financial sector, the outdated tax system, and

5. Consultation with Economists on the Macroeconomic Situation
16.
A macroeconomic roundtable was organized with
Moroccan economists o f different profiles and backgrounds,
including university researchers, private sector operatives,
and public sector officials. Meetings were held with a W o r l d
Bank team led by the Middle East and North Africa region’s
chief economist. Discussion centered on the development o f
a strategic vision for the Moroccan economy, from a
macroeconomic perspective. Participants stressed that a
strategic vision must link macroeconomic concerns to
sectoral/growth policy goals. Discussions underlined the fact
that economic growth must be viewed as a collective project
with a vision shared and owned by all development actors in
the country.

Consultations highlighted the
importance of approaching
economic growth as a collective
project with a vision shared and
owned by all development actors in
the country.
Thus, the urgent need to develop a
strategic visionfor the Moroccan
economy. This vision must account
for the country’s strategic choices
and identi& sectors of growth and
necessaw institutional reforms.

17.
Moreover, participants highlighted the important role o f the W o r l d Bank as a source o f
information and refined analyses on development priorities and as an institution that can sound, when
necessary, an alarm o n issues that must be addressed urgently.
18.

These debates provided the following conclusions:
There i s urgent need to develop a strategc vision for the Moroccan economy. This vision must
account for the country’s strategic choices and sectoral stakes and identify sectors o f growth
and necessary institutional reforms,
A macroeconomic framework must be implemented based o n extensive consultations. This
framework should favor growth and provide stability.
Processes to improve different sectors’ competitiveness must be studied and the impact o f free
trade agreements must be better analyzed. The opportunities accompanying Free Trade
Agreements must also be identified and better
exploited.

Sector reforms must be accelerated and strengthened for greater credibility. Other reforms also
include fiscal/tax reform and administration and agricultural reforms. To be sustainable, all
these reforms must be supported by social and political policies and stakeholders.
Adapting and improving Morocco’s statistical system would allow for more-refined analyses. I t
would also allow decision makers to formulate policy that better responds to such challenging
sectors as justice, education, and governance.

70
Water sector reform i s a priority closely related to many other sectors. Reforms in this sector
must also be closely articulated to other institutional reforms.

6. Consultation o n the Gender Dimensions o f Development
19.
These consultations gathered representatives from development NGOs and women’s rights
groups, as w e l l as university researchers. Participants stressed the multidimensional/cross-cutting nature
of gender and underlined the need to take such considerations into account when formulating reforms in
all sectors.
The Bank has a central role in rejning
gender-sensitive analyses and studies
to inform a coherent national strategy
and be implemented in each sector. On
the other hand, data on poverty levels,
living standards, the work of rural
women, and other areas where data
and statistics are scarce should be
targeted to better inform policies.

20.
Current deficiencies in addressing gender issues
were highlighted, notably insufficient institutional
mechanisms and unfocused analysis, and strategy. There
i s a lack o f coherence and coordination in addressing
gender issues since there i s no overall national strategy.
Participants stressed the central role o f the Bank in
refining gender-sensitive analyses and studies that could
be translated into specific measures to i n f o r m a coherent
strategy and be implemented in each sector. Moreover,
participants viewed the Bank’s role in promoting gender
awareness as crucial not only in sectors where reforms are
being implemented but also in the general W o r l d Bank-

The following points were debated and considered indispensable t o the country’s continued

development:
Strategies and sector policy reform should reflect gender specific actions, which need to be
identified through more thorough analyses.
Sector policies must refer to a coherent general strategy responding t o gender considerations.
Certain sectors must develop a stronger approach to gender as i s the case with justice, where
the new family l a w and penal and labor codes must be implemented and domestic violence
laws must be enforced.
Education reform must be a priority as i t promotes development and ensures women’s
autonomy.
In implementing educational reform, quality improvements are vital. Revision o f manuals and
curricula i s a priority since current ones are characterized by gender inequalities.
Developing analyses of the impacts on women by the 2010 economic liberalization are key.
H o w this opening will affect employment and entrepreneurship should be addressed, especially
since most vulnerable sectors have businesses/workforces that are primarily ownedstaffed by
women.
The impact o f public administration reforms o n women’s employment must be monitored and
evaluated.
The High Commission o f Planning’s effort t o collect data o n women’s issues should be
supported. Data on poverty levels, living standards, the work o f rural women, and other areas
where data and statistics are scarce should be targeted to better i n f o r m policies.

71
7. Consultation with ProfessionalAgricultural Organizations

22.
Consultations with Agribusiness associations (OPA) were centered on agncultural growth and
rural development. Participants stressed that agncultural issues must be more integrated into economic
planning. Agriculture i s currently overshadowed by other sectors and i s not considered a potential area of
growth. Consequently, i t i s deprived o f many opportunities and public support.

23.

Particular focus was put on water resources, access to bank
financing, land reform, and taxation. Participants stressed that rural
private investment could be improved through developing rural
infrastructure and instituting land reform. Moreover, participants
pointed out the lack o f dialogue with the government and decision
makers in this sector. Consequently, their considerations were rarely
taken into account in decisions affecting the sector. These factors
strongly impede their capacity to strengthen or contribute to this
sector's growth.

Dialogue and coordination between Agribusiness associations should be supported.
Land reform must be accelerated to encourage investment in rural areas.

8. Consultation on the Water Sector

25.
This consultation built on previous Bank team discussions and
notes, and contributed to clarifying a diagnosis o f the water sector. I t
helped stakeholders evolve a more consensual vision o f the priorities
and issues to be addressed. It was recognized that despite previous
public sector efforts to make needed improvements, there are many
difficult challenges to overcome, including demographic growth,
increased poverty, the exodus from rural areas, a precarious
urbanization, and insufficient infrastructure. Current strategies and
actions were considered to be inadequate in addressing these challenges. During the consultation the
following recommendations were made:
Water sector reform is
crucial to Morocco 's
development and must be
closely articulated to other
institutional reforms.

Water and sanitation sector regulation

9. Consultations on Social Development
26.
This threefold consultation gathered participants from NGOs, the public sector, and academia and
was very fruitful in terms of understanding stakeholders’ views and priorities o f social development.
Given the increasing importance o f social development and poverty reduction in the country’s
development agenda, participants insisted the Bank’s strategy should take into consideration the urgency
and cross-cutting dimension of the issues involved. The main challenges that were identified are the
following:
0

0

0

Social and economic integration o f youth i s lagging. Youth comprise about 40 percent o f the
total population and suffer high rates o f unemployment. The deficient education system and i t s
inability to meet the human resource demands for growing the private sector have contributed
to rising joblessness.
Increasing rural poverty and rural emigration have l e d to new forms o f vulnerability and
poverty in peri-urban areas, aggravated by weakening traditional social solidarity. Precarious
urbanization and insufficient infrastructure also exacerbate urban poverty and exclusion.
Despite new reforms of the family code and increased political representation, numerous
gender inequalities s t i l l exist, particularly in economic and employment opportunities for
women. M o r e efforts toward effective implementation o f the above-mentioned reforms need to
be made, as well as in promoting political participation.
The recommendations discussed by participants and agreed o n can be summarized as follows:

27.
0

0

0

0

Conduct sector social analysis to support
policy formulation and sector strategies.
Conduct the analyses needed to develop a
comprehensive approach to the economic
and social inclusion o f youth.
Support government efforts to integrate
poverty reduction programs into
a
coordinated and coherent strategy for social
development.
Reinforce
institutional
responsibility,
transparency, and good governance, as w e l l
as community involvement in local
development initiatives and social policies.

Social development and poverty
reduction are increasingly central
to the country’s development
agenda, particularly regarding
the needfor youth inclusion.
Hence, in formulating its strategy,
it is importantfor the Bank to
consider the cross-cutting
dimensions of the social and
economic integration ofyouth.

73
0

Develop an adequate information and evaluation system for social development programs.

10. Education

28.
Throughout the consultation process, whatever the sector being examined, education was cited by
discussants as a crucial factor in national development. Whether stakeholders were f r o m civil society, the
private sector, academia, or government, they all insisted that improving educational quality i s an urgent
need that must b e m e t if Morocco i s to move forward economically.
29.
In order to better understand how key actors envisioned the sector, i t s needs, and possibilities, a
consultation was organized with representatives from c i v i l society, unions, and academics. Although, it
was generally agreed that education remains the primary public service mechanism for social
advancement, the sector faces many daunting challenges to meeting the country’s development needs.
Participants identified the following major constraints to raising educational efficiency and quality:
0
0

0

0
0

30.

Poor govemance o f the educational system and a lack o f accountability
N o teacher development strategy
A weak evaluation and monitoring system
Unclear educational responsibilities o f schools
L a c k o f a transparent budgeting system
L o w public confidence in the schools
Limited public-private partnership
Recommendations for improvement focused o n the following proposals:
Modernize the educational system, improving govemance/oversight at all levels.
Strengthen decentralization, creating an ethic of accountability.
Review and improve h o w teachers themselves are educated, and adopt continuous training.
Strengthen monitoring/evaluation mechanisms and make them an integral part o f the system.
Review the sector’s budgeting process, analyzing the Ministry o f Education’s share o f the
national budget and h o w i t i s allocated.
Analyze the values transmitted through public school, focusing o n curricular materials and the
pedagogy o f teachers’ training.
Establish norms for educational quality while strengthening equal opportunity for girls and
boys in both rural and urban areas.
Establish a regulatory authority and enhance public-private partnership in the education sector.

3 1.
Open and constructive debates highlighted the importance o f involving all key actors in long-term
discussion o f educational reform. Participants asked the Bank t o host regular meetings focusing o n the
reform process. This would not only engage the Bank team, i t would also allow stakeholders to debate
n e w constraints and opportunities and build a consensus for action as reform proposals arise and are
carried out.

CAS Annex 5 Morocco: Country Financing Parameters
Summary:

1.
This note describes the application o f the new Bank policy o n expenditure eligibility for Bankfinanced activities in Morocco. It proposes the financing parameters for i t s implementation and the
underlying conditions for i t s application. The new policy allows the Bank t o finance expenditures needed
to meet the development objectives o f the operations i t supports, within an overall framework that
addresses risks to fiscal sustainability and the appropriate use o f Bank resources, in a way that i s
consistent with the Articles of Agreement. The new policy i s expected t o increase the flexibility o f use o f
Bank loan proceeds; reduce the transaction costs to the country and the Bank, and enable easier
harmonization o f donor procedures around country systems. It rests o n three guiding principles: (a) the
expenditures financed from Bank loan proceeds are productive; (b) the impact o f operations financed
under such loans o n the borrowing country’s fiscal sustainability i s acceptable; and (c) oversight
arrangements o n the use o f Bank funds are acceptable.
2.
The Morocco country team has reviewed the new Bank policy o n expenditure eligibility from
both macroeconomic and project perspectives and welcomes the added flexibility in Bank financing to
accompany the government’s efforts in improving the efficiency and effectiveness o f their development
program. The changes in expenditure eligibility are not expected to have an impact o n fiscal sustainability
and thus the risk t o fiscal sustainability i s considered very low. The changes are n o t likely to lead to an
increase in demand for Bank financing but will simplify procedures and reduce the transaction costs
imposed by the current policy o n our counterpart. Over time, i t will help set the framework for more
efficient implementation o f the govemment’s own programs.

3.
The government authorities have expressed their strong support for the flexibility in expenditure
eligibility and alignment with their own systems and procedures, in particular for the simplification i t
provides in reducing the number o f procedures and the parallel reporting and related transaction costs. I t
i s estimated that full implementation o f the new policy in combination with the increased use o f the
government financial management system in Bank-financed projects, w o u l d reduce direct costs to the
Government o f Morocco (GOM) in the order o f US$1 m i l l i o n annually, mostly for salary expenditures
and project information requirements related directly to handling parallel Bank reporting and
disbursement-related activities and which have n o added value to the projects and/or government systems.

4.
The Bank team consulted the Government o f Morocco at various occasions regarding the changes
to the eligibility o f expenditures and each time the Moroccan authorities were very supportive and saw in
i t a flexibility that would help them jump start some o f their reforms given their current fiscal constraints.
The Moroccan counterparts were among the selected sample o f countries w h o were consulted to assess
borrowers feedback on the then-proposed changes. They were since then informed o n various other
occasions o f the Bank simplification agenda including with regard t o the.2 eligibility o f expenditure.
Finally and before submitting this note before the Board, the Bank team consulted with the Moroccan
authorities regarding the proposed financing parameters. They strongly support the policy changes and the
parameters proposed here.
5.
This note first explains the macroeconomic perspective and then the expected impact o f the
changes in eligibility on four areas and sets the financing parameters for these: (1) cost sharing, (2) local
cost financing, (3) recurrent costs, and (4) taxes and duties.

75

Macroeconomic Perspective

6.

In general, the Bank35considers the macro economic framework satisfactory with l o w inflation
and strong external accounts, underpinned by improving financial policies. In recent years, the
government has taken action to improve fiscal sustainability, in particular actions to preserve revenues
and reduce the wage bill as a share o f GDP. Their objective i s to reduce the fiscal deficit t o some 3 %age
points o f GDP in the medium term by reducing the fiscal deficit by 0.5 %age point annually.

During 1999-2001, Morocco experienced large fiscal deficits exceeding 6 % o f GDP financed
7.
mainly through privatization revenues. In 2002, the country’s fiscal position began t o strengthen,
recording 4.3 % deficit. During the same year, the wage bill stood at 12.2 % o f GDP down from 12.5 %
in 2001 and for the first time since the mid 1990s. The budget deficit deteriorated again in 2003 caused by
a one time increase in wage bill for payment o f latent liabilities due to certain civil servants. The central
govemment public debt has, on the other hand, decreased from a high o f 89 % o f GDP in 1993 to 74 % in
1998 and to around 7 1 % at the end o f 2002.
8.
The Moroccan authorities reiterated their commitment to improving the fiscal sustainability
during various discussions held with the Bank and the European Union. The Bank will provide support to
the government reform program through a Public Administration Reform Loan (PARL) in addition t o the
ongoing multi-year ESW activity providing advice, training and technical assistance in the areas o f civil
service reform and budgetary management. The P A R L aims at (i)
improving the efficiency o f budget
expenditures by allowing greater flexibility to regional administrations and by introducing performance
based budgeting; (ii)
enhancing the efficiency and quality o f the c i v i l service; and (iii)
improving the
fiscal sustainability of the government budget through control of the level o f civil service wage bill.
9.
The new Bank policy on expenditure eligibility presents n o macroeconomic concerns, particularly
related to fiscal sustainability (one of the three criteria). The CAS current base case lending for Morocco
i s set at a fixed lending range and regardless o f h o w i t i s spent (investment, recurrent, taxes), the country’s
debt burden will increase by the same amount. Moreover, there i s n o “additiona1ity”of Bank funds; they
are fully integrated in the budget, and fiscal deficits are calculated and financed accordingly. Our overall
analysis o f fiscal sustainability i s n o different with the added flexibility introduced by the new policy than
with the current policy.

10.
Our most recent estimates 3 6 o f fiscal and debt sustainability situation indicate that ifthe
government implements i t s proposed public sector reforms (mainly reducing the wage bill and
consolidating revenues), the debt-to-GDP ratio i s projected t o decline f r o m i t s current level of 71 % of
GDP to a sustainable situation o f 62 % o f GDP by 2012.
11.
For illustrative purposes, ifwe take a Bank investment program o f $150 million and say that $30
million could be allocated for recurrent rather than investment costs, this represents 0.4 % o f the
government’s current budget and 0.24 % of i t s total expenditures. Public expenditure whether financed
through Bank loans, government revenues and/or other sources are subject to the same government fiscal
rules. All Bank funding i s and will be done through the government’s o w n fiscal targets and as such, we

propose a Bank financing o f up to 100 % o f all expenditures necessary to achieve given development
objectives o f the funded programs.
12.
In addition, the latest core diagnostics undertaken by the Bank (CFAA and CPAR3’ ) show that
the fiduciary framework o f the GOM i s basically sound and provides a strong control environment, even
though efficiency and effectiveness can be enhanced.
The major recommendations in the Country Financial Accountability are in line with the government’s
own reform program. Morocco will be a regional pilot in moving to more reliance o n country systems.
13.
The main conclusion o f the CFAA3* i s that the Moroccan public financial management system i s
characterized by a good level of transparency and accuracy and backed by a strong Ministry o f Finance
(which has an extensive treasury network in the country). The integrated computerization o f the system i s
on-going and expected to be effective in 2005. The system o f control i s comprehensive (internal, external,
ex ante, ex post) but requires further co-ordination and modernization. The budget system i s governed by
a clear set o f rules and guidelines for i t s preparation and execution. I t ensures consistency with the overall
policy and macro economic fi-amework and i s characterized by an acceptable level o f participation o f line
ministries and an effective expenditure control by the MOF.
14.
The areas o f weaknesses identified are the lengthy implementation cycle and complexity o f the
lines o f authority and responsibility between central and local levels during the budget implementation.
However, some reforms, such as performance based budgeting, performance oriented controls, c i v i l
service reform, and integrated information systems have already been engaged by the GOM to enhance
the operational efficiency o f i t s budget execution.

Bank’s Program
15.
As o f April 1, 2004, the Bank portfolio in Morocco comprised 14 active projects ( o f which one
GEF), amounting to a total net commitment o f U S 3 2 0 million, o f which U S 2 4 1 m i l l i o n were
undisbursed. The Bank’s portfolio covers the following sectors: Railway 27 %, agriculture 22 %, health
sector reform 21 %, water 20 %, asset management 14 %, and the rest in legal and judicial reform, social
sector and environmental activities.

16.
Disbursement performance i s typically weak and i s lagging behind physical implementation, e.g.
only $18 million have been disbursed as o f April 1, 2004, on investment operations, resulting in a
disbursement ratio o f 6 %. Most of these delays are due to the cumbersome administrative procedures
magnified by the additional requirements o f parallel tracks for Bank versus non-Bank funded transactions.
The Government i s aware o f the problems and taking actions to improve the efficiency. The application
o f the Bank new eligibility policy would help greatly t o reduce these delays.
17.
The Government and the Bank have initiated during the last two years, new ways o f cooperation
through participatory Country Portfolio Performance Reviews and more recently, Quarterly Portfolio
Performance Reviews (QPPR) t o identify areas o f bottlenecks and propose solutions t o a smoother
implementation o f activities. The last QPPR took place o n April 2, 2004.

18.
A key element o f the new policy i s ensuring that the borrower i s committed t o and financing a
large share o f its development program. In this case, i t should not matter if the Bank i s funding
investment or recurrent expenditures or taxes since i t s contribution i s small.

19.
The Bank’s base case lending program in the current CAS allows for lending up to $250 million a
year, or about 0.5 % of GDP, 11 % o f Morocco’s investment budget and 2 % o f the total budget. The
government has a n ambitious reform program across a range o f sectors and has assured adequate
financing of priority sectors in the 2004 budget law. Government’s resources (taxes, revenues and
domestic borrowing) represents 96 % o f the total budget and 77 % o f the development (i.e. investment)
budget3’ . As noted above all development expenditure, irrespective o f source o f funding, i s included in
the budget and Bank-financed expenditure i s a small proportion o f development expenditure both overall
and in any given sector.
20.
Furthermore, and in line with the Bank’s objective to achieve greater reliance o n country systems
in Morocco, allowing 100 % Bank financing in a given projectlprogram enables us to focus more o n
enhancing country operational procedures, practices and associated institutional capacity and achieve
more sustainable development outcomes. The Bank may therefore fund up to 100 % o f individual projects
in Morocco.

Local Cost Financing
21.
Currently, at a project level, Bank financing o f local expenditures i s restricted to lower
disbursement %ages than for foreign expenditures. In recent years local cost in total project costs
averaged 82 % 40 . The Bank prevailing rates in financing local costs by category are as follows:
0
Goods. The Bank generally finances 100 % o f foreign expenditures o n goods. In the case o f
locally procured equipment, the Bank financing ranges from 70 % t o 90 % except for exfactory costs financed at 100 % for most projects appraised before 2001.
0

Works. For works, the Bank currently finances 70-80 % o f eligible expenditures with a few
exceptions where the reimbursement rate i s 100 % for foreign expenditures.
Consultant services and training;. . For consultant services and training, the SDP
rates for consultant services i s fixed at 75 % for foreign expenditures and 70 % for local
expenditures.

22.
The fact that current rates are less than 100 % financing o f any given local cost transaction adds
to the lengthy budget implementation. Each transaction i s currently reviewed at various stages to ensure
(1) eligibility to Bank financing; and (2) that t w o distinct payments are made t o account for Bank and
government financing separately when they are both budgeted in the government budget under one
heading. As stated earlier, the added flexibility in the new policy, will improve project efficiency through
the reduction in transaction costs and the time it takes to implement a given Bank-funded activity.
In order to simplify procedures, reduce transaction costs and enhance the implementation
23.
efficiency o f Bank-funded activities, i t i s proposed that the Bank finance local costs as required by the
project’s development objectives.

24.
The financing needs o f the country’s investment program exceed the government’s resources.
The Government o f Morocco’s own resources f r o m taxes and other sources, cover only 77 % o f i t s total
39

40

Kingdom o f Morocco, Ministry o f Finance and Privatization.
Average local cost financing based on project information for 1998-2003

78
investment program financing requirements. 23 % o f the investment program needs are covered by
donors, including the Bank with 11 %, and some domestic borrowing. As explained earlier, the current
Bank funded projects are mostly concentrated in sectors such as agriculture, water, education, health,
housing, etc that consume mostly local goods and services rather than foreign, e.g. the share o f local
expenditures in the most recent projects funded by the Bank i s 82 % o f total project costs. This trend i s
41
likely to continue with the projected investment operations
for FY 05 and beyond in support o f
education, justice, water and basic rural infrastructure 42 .Financing only foreign expenditures would not
enable the Bank to assist in the financing o f such projects. The two criteria for Bank financing o f local
costs are, therefore, met by the Morocco’s development program. The Bank may, hence, finance local
costs in the proportions required by individual projects. N o distinction needs to be made between foreign
and local expenditures in individual projects, unless needed for project-specific considerations.

Recurrent Costs Financing

25.
The current policy provides for incremental financing o f recurrent costs o n a declining basis
(OMS 1.21). Such financing would normally occur o n a temporary basis for a transition period until a
sustainable financial situation could be achieved.
26.
The new policy provides greater flexibility in financing recurrent expenditures on the basis o f a
counterpart strategy developed in light of the macroeconomic and project context and ensuring aggregate
fiscal and debt sustainability and sustainability o f Bank-financed recurrent costs. In Morocco, the new
policy will be applied within the government’s fiscal policy framework o f personnel expenditure control
and fiscal deficit and debt sustainability targets.
27.
N o country-level limit on Bank financing o f recurrent costs i s proposed. As explained above,
financing of recurrent costs in Bank supported projects has n o significant impact on fiscal nor debt
sustainability .

Taxes and Duties
28.
The new policy on eligibility o f expenditure allows the Bank to finance the reasonable costs o f
taxes and duties associated with project expenditures. At a project level, purchase o f goods and services
funded by foreign loans are submitted to the usual fiscal policy (including income taxes and VAT). Given
that the Moroccan system allocates project funds for both Bank and counterpart funds through i t s national
budget, mobilizing the required counterpart funding for taxes and duties, during the course o f project
implementation, does not constitute a problem in Morocco. Nonetheless, the fact that each transaction i s
only reimbursed on the basis o f an amount excluding taxes, means that there i s a need for two separate
tracks for each transaction funded by the Bank: one for the Bank’s funding which excludes taxes and
duties and one for the part not financed by the Bank. As explained above, this leads to further
implementation delays and to higher transaction costs for doing business with the Bank.
29.
The Moroccan tax regime 43 i s well performing. On average it poses n o major concern. Tax
revenue compares favorably with that o f middle-income countries. Over the last two to three years the tax
revenue-to-GDP ratio has declined to 21.3 % in 2002 partly due t o trade liberalization and the
implementation o f the free trade agreement with the European Union. Custom duties are on a declining
trend (from 23.5 % in 1995 to 18.5 % in 2002). Some additional 44 gains could be made by improving

Range o f rates applicable to investment income range from 10-30 %.
Income taxes are set for increasing income brackets and the applicable rates go from 0 % to 44
%.
Corporate tax rate i s 35 %. A number o f exemptions apply by geographical
location and according to the income level.
A Value Added Tax i s structured around four ad valorem rates o f 7, 10, 14 and 20% based on
the type o f service.
According to the WTO, the average customs duties o f a l l sectors in Morocco i s 33.4 %.
Overall the Moroccan taxes and import duties are not considered excessive and there are n o
taxes or duties that the Bank would not finance.
