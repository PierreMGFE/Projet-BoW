EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
i.
With a multi-ethnic population of about 12.6 million and a per-capita GDP of about
$2,200, Guatemala is the largest economy in Central America. The country’s difficult colonial
past and a debilitating 36-year civil war (which ended in 1996) have left a legacy of high poverty
and inequality, poor social indicators and deep social and political divisions. These are only
slowly being overcome, as the country continues to consolidate democracy and address issues of
equity/inclusion, growth and the establishment of credible public institutions.
ii.
The current Government, in office since 2004, has demonstrated considerable
commitment to the achievement of national goals established in the 1996 Peace Accords in the
political and human rights, as well as socio-economic, spheres. Its main emphases include
fighting corruption, enhancing security and reactivating inclusive economic growth (stagnant in
the 2001-2003 period) as a means of reducing poverty and inequality. Its development plan—
Vamos Guatemala!—provides a viable framework for the country’s progress. It includes three
main pillars: (i) Solidarity (focused on human capital, basic services and rural infrastructure); (ii)
Growth/Competitiveness (aimed at accelerating growth through trade expansion, business climate
improvements, private participation in infrastructure, financial sector reform and promotion of
SMEs) and (iii) Environmental Sustainability.
The pillars stand on a foundation of
‘Fundamentals’ comprising macroeconomic stability, personal and legal security, governance
improvements and decentralization.
iii.
Following a period of considerable tension over development priorities in the closing
years of the previous administration, the Bank regards the current policy environment in
Guatemala as a window of opportunity—albeit with significant risks due to socio-political
tensions—to move forward on a more inclusive, accelerated growth and poverty reduction path,
towards achievement of the country’s own goals. The Bank’s country assistance strategy (CAS)
for the period FY05-08 has been developed within the Vamos Guatemala! framework. The
selection of specific areas for Bank support within the broader plan is based on careful
consideration, with Government, of specific results/outcomes to be achieved by the end of the
CAS period, the recommendations of core Bank analytical work—Poverty Assessment, CEM,
Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) and ongoing PER and CFAA/CPAR—the findings of a
retrospective Completion Report on the last CAS, and areas supported by other donors.
iv.
The Bank’s current portfolio ($255 million undisbursed) consists of eleven investment
operations and a financial sector adjustment loan, which are generally well-aligned with the
Vamos Guatemala! pillars and with the results matrix for the present CAS period. In terms of
new IBRD lending during the FY05-08 period, the strategy adopted is to move forward with a
balanced program which allows for about half of lending to be provided through a series of DPLs
focused on growth/investment climate, public expenditures and governance. The other half
would be devoted to an investment program of five operations—education; nutrition and
maternal/child heath; local and rural development (including environment); land administration;
and, public sector management—aimed at directly reducing inequality and continuing to
strengthen public institutions. An infrastructure guarantee operation is also being considered.
WBI capacity-building activities would support each lending operation, and IFC and MIGA
would seek to complement IBRD lending for policy and institutional changes related to the
growth agenda (via the DPL program) through investments and technical assistance in
banking/insurance, infrastructure, extractive industries, manufacturing (including MSMEs), and
the value-added export sectors. Analytical work for the CAS period will involve completion of
the PER and CFAA/CPAR, deepening sectoral knowledge in the financial sector, energy and

environment and updating core diagnostic reports in the outer years, including the Poverty
Assessment, CEM and the ICA in preparation for the next CAS.
v.
The $660 million base case of the CAS includes up to three development policy loans of
$100 million each, $310 million in investment lending and a possible infrastructure guarantee
operation (up to $182 million – of which $50 million is included in the CAS envelope, per agreed
norms). The actual number of DPLs provided in the base case will depend on demonstrated
progress on the country’s development agenda, in accordance with a set of indicative policy
performance measures pertaining to fiscal performance, governance/ transparency, social sector
development and growth. Specific fiscal, governance, social spending, financial sector deepening
and PPI triggers are included for moving to the high case, under which an additional $120
million DPL would be provided. Halting or back-tracking on policy reform would result in a low
case, limited to the core investment program of $310 million for projects in human development,
local and rural development, property rights and governance.
vi.
Continued strong policy performance by Government, and, hence, successful
implementation of this CAS is subject to three main risks: (i) political gridlock, given a divided
Congress and a polarized electorate; (ii) still-high social tensions—and the potential for
violence—associated with mistrust and long-held grievances against the state and the private
sector with respect to past human rights abuses, discrimination and economic exploitation; and
(iii) exogenous shocks deriving from natural phenomena (earthquakes, volcanic activity and
hurricanes, to which Guatemala is subject) and/or deterioration in the external economic
environment, including prolonged recessions in export markets and terms of trade shocks.
vii.
The Bank’s assistance program for Guatemala has been carefully calibrated to take
account of the risks inherent in the country’s difficult political and social context. The choice of a
programmatic series of single-tranche operations for the provision of quick-disbursing support
means that there will be several points at which the Bank’s program could be reassessed if
political gridlock or social tensions appear to be derailing the development agenda, despite
ongoing Government efforts to address them. With this in mind, the Government and the Bank
intend to monitor the program on an annual basis and to conduct a formal mid-term review of the
CAS to assess progress and determine the need for any revisions to the scale and timing of the
Bank’s lending program. To help mitigate the risk of natural disasters, the Government, with
Bank assistance, is strengthening environmental monitoring and early warning systems, with a
focus on the most vulnerable areas. In the event of a major natural disaster, however, the Bank,
with Government, would rethink this partnership strategy in light of changed priorities and define
a new one for presentation to the Board.
viii.
In its consideration of this Country Assistance Strategy, Executive Directors may wish to
provide guidance on the following questions:
(i)

Does the Board agree that the current policy and fiduciary environment in Guatemala
constitutes an appropriate context for accelerating Bank assistance to the country
after a considerable hiatus during the previous administration?

(ii)

Does the strategy adequately balance support for reduction of inequality and poverty
with a push for growth and improvements in the business climate?

GUATEMALA
COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
With about 12.6 million inhabitants and an average per capita income of about
US$2,200, Guatemala is the largest economy in Central America. The country is notable
for its rich cultural diversity. Indigenous Maya peoples (comprising some 21 linguistic
groups) and Ladinos of European and mixed descent each make up about half of the
country’s population. In addition, there are small minorities of Xinka speakers in the
south and Afro-descendant Garifuna-speakers, largely concentrated on the Caribbean
coast. Guatemala is also physically diverse with numerous distinct geographic zones,
including forested highland in the west, fertile lowland coasts, and one of the world’s
most important remaining tropical forests in the northern Peten. While the country is
endowed with significant natural resources, much of its terrain is volcanic and prone to
severe weather and seismic activity, complicating communications and contributing to
the physical isolation of many villages and communities. The age structure of
Guatemala’s population is very young and largely rural; more than half the population is
under the age of 18 and 61 percent resides in rural areas.
2.
While a source of cultural strength and rich historical heritage, Guatemala’s
ethnic diversity has also unfortunately been accompanied by a pattern of conflict, high
inequality and exclusion, dating back to early colonial times (Box A). In the latter half of
the 20th century, long-standing social and economic tensions sparked a 36-year civil war
that began in 1960 and ended in 1996. The internal strife peaked in intensity and
violence during the early 1980s and increasingly affected Guatemala’s social and
economic performance through the loss of many lives and widespread destruction of
assets, especially of the indigenous Maya population. The economic impact of the civil
war was devastating: some estimates suggest that if the war had not taken place,
Guatemala’s per capita GDP would now be 40 percent larger than it actually is. The
signing of the 1996 Peace Accords between the Government and guerrilla leaders,
following a long and difficult negotiations process, marked an important turning point in
Guatemala’s political and socio-economic development. As noted in Box A, in addition
to ending the armed conflict, the Peace Accords aimed to reverse the country’s
historically exclusionary pattern of socio-economic development, setting targets in four
main areas: (i) resettlement, re-incorporation and reconciliation, (ii) human development,
(iii) productive and sustainable development, and (iv) modernization of the state and
improved governance.
3.
In the eight years since the signing of the Peace Accords, some progress has been
made towards achievement of the explicit targets established within the agreements,
though much remains to be done. Notably, the size of the armed forces has been
substantially reduced, a new civilian police force (PNC) established, and steps have been

1

Box A: Historical Context
Policies and practices in Guatemala throughout the 1800s contributed to an exclusionary
pattern of development, particularly with respect to land and labor – with the historical practice of
expropriating land and requiring forced labor from indigenous communities accelerating in the late
1800s and the first half of the 20th century with the spread of coffee (which requires secure property
rights). Land consolidation under individual land-owners was continued until recent times, as
diversification of export crops brought new expropriations from peasants. In turn, the pattern of
large plantations owned by a small elite and manned by subsistence-wage indigenous workers –
most often forced into service by loss of land, legal requirements and debt servitude – provided
little incentive for land owners or the workers themselves to invest in their human capital. Thus,
investments in education, and hence, long term economic growth, for indigenous groups lagged far
behind other countries in the region (e.g., Costa Rica, Colombia) which relied on a small-holder
model for developing their coffee sector. The situation was exacerbated by discriminatory policies
which reserved education rights for “citizens”, a status not fully accorded to the indigenous or
women until 1945. In consequence, most women and virtually all indigenous communities
remained illiterate – and given literacy requirements for voting rights, effectively excluded them
from the political process.
By 1960 when Guatemala’s 36-year civil war (1960-1996) broke out, the country was far
behind in its development – lagging well behind comparable countries on virtually all key social
indicators and faring worse than many much poorer neighbors (in GDP per capita terms) such as
Nicaragua and Honduras. As is well known, Guatemala’s civil war was one of the longest and
bloodiest in Latin America. It is estimated that about 2 percent of the population (over 200,000
people) were killed or “disappeared”, over a million (close to 10%) were displaced and about 600
villages and communities completely destroyed. Mayan communities bore the brunt of the
violence, suffering the vast majority of casualties and damage or losses to property. While it is
impossible to quantify the full range of social and economic impacts of the brutal civil war, the
Historical Clarification Commission reports estimates that during the 1980s alone, the costs of the
war amounted to 15 months of production or 121% of the 1990 GDP. Some recent econometric
analyses (Lopez 2001) indicate that had the war not occurred, per capita GDP would have been
about 40% higher and poverty 12% lower by 2000. Social indicators lagged even further behind
growth, with Guatemala remaining among the worst performers in the region on most education
and mortality measures.
The cessation of the civil war and signing of the Peace Accords in 1996, following a protracted
negotiations process, marked a turning point in Guatemala’s development path. Beyond formally
ending the armed conflict and addressing related political issues, the Peace Accords identified an
ambitious agenda for reconciliation and reincorporation of excluded groups, human development,
sustainable economic development and modernization of the state and improved governance.
Three cross-cutting themes were also emphasized through the Accords: (i) the rights of indigenous
communities; (ii) commitments regarding the rights and position of women, and (iii) a
strengthening of social participation. Among the various Accords concluded within the framework
of the peace process, the Social and Agrarian Issues Accord (May 1996) established the overall
development agenda, with stronger social orientation and a general goal of closing the huge gap
between the rich and the poor. The Accord covered a range of issues including growth, tax
revenues, public spending, education and health (each with monitorable targets). It also
emphasized broader citizen participation in development projects through the establishment of
decentralized development councils. With respect to land, the Accord focused on market-assisted
land distribution, creation of a Land Fund and improved land administration.

taken to establish mechanisms at sub-national and local levels (community, municipal
and departmental development councils) to increase the empowerment of local
communities. In terms of socio-economic development targets, progress has been
uneven, with important gains in some areas, e.g., substantially enhanced education and
health coverage (although quality improvements are needed), sustained increases in
social sector spending, improved coverage of basic utility services, better management of
public finances (via implementation of an Integrated Financial Management System
(SIAF), and increases in public revenues (albeit below agreed targets). Nonetheless,
progress has been slower than hoped for in a number of key areas including achievement
of higher growth rates, implementation of tax reforms aimed at raising revenues to 12
percent of GDP, acceleration of land registration and redistribution, and reducing crime
and violence, which remain widespread. Deceleration in progress towards achievement
of the Peace Accords targets was especially apparent in the last years of the Portillo
administration, 2002-2003, in tandem with a marked weakening of governance and
public sector institutions, which cost Guatemala much-needed international support.
However, the incoming Berger Administration, elected for the 2004-2008 presidential
term on an anti-corruption, pro-growth platform, has reaffirmed its strong commitment to
the Peace Accords and to the achievement of the socio-economic development targets
contained therein. Its economic reactivation plan, “Vamos Guatemala!”, described below
in Section III, is fully consistent with the framework established in the Peace Accords
and aims to reignite progress towards achievement of its targets.

II. COUNTRY CONTEXT AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
A.

POLITICAL CONTEXT

4.
Since the signing of the Peace Accords in 1996, Guatemala has made substantial
progress in consolidating peace and democracy through three electoral cycles. The most
recent presidential election, which was held at the end of 2003 in two rounds, registered a
record turnout and was largely peaceful. Oscar Berger of the GANA coalition—made up
of three political parties—was elected president with a clear margin of the vote, and
assumed office in January 2004. After four years of harsh confrontation between the
public and private sectors during the Portillo administration, the election of the more
private sector-oriented Berger Government has been positive for the country’s local and
international image and investment climate. As noted above, the Berger administration
has also emphasized compliance with the political and socio-economic commitments
assumed in the Peace Accords. During the first few months, President Berger publicly
affirmed his personal commitment to achieving peace targets and strengthening the
institutional structure around them. A new peace commission has been established in
order to follow up on all matters related to the Peace Accords, an economic compensation
program for war victims has been put into effect, military demobilization is underway,
and strong priority has been given to protecting budgetary allocations for the social
sectors in an otherwise austere fiscal environment.

3

5.
In an effort to reestablish the credibility of public institutions following a series of
corruption scandals involving high public officials in the previous administration, the
Berger Administration—in line with its campaign promises—has also committed itself to
fighting corruption and promoting transparency. The first year of the Berger
administration has seen a number of high-profile arrests and indictments of senior
officials of the previous administration—including e.g., the former Vice President, the
former Comptroller General and the previous head of the Tax Administration—which
have received wide popular support. In addition, there have been well-publicized
initiatives to increase the transparency of public financial management and procurement,
at both the national and sub-national levels. More intractable has been the problem of
reducing violent crime—also a major campaign plank—with continuing high incidence
of homicides and assaults during 2004. Efforts to reform the police and military, the
human rights office and the justice system are receiving high priority, and the
Government is seeking international assistance for its efforts.
6.
Despite strong support for the Government’s priorities in Guatemala and abroad,
the Executive faced an uphill battle in implementing its legislative agenda in 2004 due
largely to the lack of a governing coalition in the National Congress and leadership of the
Congress by its principal opposition in the presidential election, UNE. Moreover, the
coalition that took Berger to the presidency—though the largest in Congress—lost one of
its three parties due in part to the President’s bold decision to drastically reduce the
military. For 2005, prospects for cooperation between the Executive and Legislative
branches appear more positive, given leadership of the Congress by Berger supporters
and ongoing efforts to amalgamate the Berger coalition—now two political parties and a
group of congressmen directly linked to the President’s campaign—into a single party,
GANA, with a common policy platform. Nonetheless, moving forward the legislative
agenda will still require reaching consensus with other parties, including the FRG (former
official party), on many initiatives—sometimes at a high political cost. Within the
broader polity, the Government also faces challenges, including from powerful interest
groups such as the ex-paramilitaries which have staged road blocks and public
demonstrations aimed at forcing the Government to pay for their “service” during the
civil war, despite strong opposition from human rights and indigenous groups. Similar
tactics have been adopted by the powerful teachers’ unions which have opposed policies
aimed at increasing parental involvement in the management of schools and increasing
the accountability of teachers for learning outcomes. In addition, unresolved land
problems have resulted in clashes (sometimes violent) between campesinos, private
proprietors of land and the police, which could escalate if ongoing mediation proves
unsuccessful.
B.

POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

7.
Largely as a result of the country’s historical legacy, poverty in Guatemala is high
and deep: about 56 percent of all Guatemalans lived in poverty in 2000 and about 16
percent in extreme poverty. Multivariate regressions show that, contrary to expectations,
there is no significant variation in poverty status among male- and female-headed
households, the latter comprising about 14 percent of total households. Although poverty

4

fell during the 1990s, this positive trend almost certainly deteriorated in the first years of
the new millennium, given an economic slowdown associated with a series of economic
shocks (see Para 15 below). Over the past decade, the drop in poverty incidence in
Guatemala was somewhat slower than might have been predicted by the economic
growth rate, largely because growth in rural areas—where most of the poor are
concentrated—has been slower than in other areas. For the most part, poverty and
vulnerability in Guatemala is associated with chronically low consumption rather than
high volatility of consumption, highlighting the importance of building the assets of the
poor, rather than income transfer mechanisms. While much higher in the North, NorthWest and the Department of San Marcos, poverty is widespread throughout Guatemala,
complicating options for geographic targeting of interventions.
8.
Besides high levels of income poverty, Guatemala’s social indicators are also
among the worst in Latin America, often falling below the indicators observed in
countries with substantially lower per-capita incomes. For example, despite significant
improvements in primary enrollments over the last decade, the average schooling of the
adult (14+) population in 2001 was only 4.3 years, compared to 4.4 years averaged by
low income countries, whose GNI per capita averages US$420. Educational attainment is
lower for women, with an average “gender” gap of one year. Guatemala’s health
outcomes are also poor: life expectancy at birth is 65 years, or well below the 69 years
average exhibited by lower middle income countries (whose GNI per capita averages
US$1,360) and infant and maternal mortality rates are high at 40-45 per thousand and
270 per 100,000 respectively—and, the rate of improvement has been slower than that of
much poorer Latin American countries such as Bolivia, Honduras and Nicaragua.
Perhaps most alarmingly, malnutrition rates among Guatemalan children are abysmal—
based on the height-for-age measure it is estimated that some 44 percent of children
under five years are stunted, with four-fifths of the malnourished children coming from
poor households.
9.
Guatemala’s high poverty and relatively poor social indicators can be traced in
large part to a highly unequal distribution of incomes, resources and opportunities; its
Gini coefficient for income of 0.57 is the second highest in Latin America (after Brazil).
The fault line separating the rich and poor runs largely along ethnic lines. For example,
while the share of Guatemalans living in poverty in 2000 was 56 percent for the overall
population, it was 76 percent among indigenous groups. Similarly, the average years of
schooling of the indigenous population (14+) is only 1.9 years, while the rest of the
population averages 5.4 years. Another, related, fault line runs along the urban-rural
divide, as mentioned above. The poor are highly dependent on agriculture (which has
been stagnating relative to other sectors since 1990), and the incidence of poverty is
almost three times greater in rural than in urban areas.
C.

MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS (MDGS)

10.
Guatemala’s current administration is strongly committed to accelerating progress
towards achievement of the MDGs, but is fighting an uphill battle on a number of fronts,
especially given the setbacks under the last administration. The most recent UN report

5

(with participation from IDB and the World Bank) on the MDGs, reviews trends in
Guatemala over the 1990-2000 period and an update is foreseen for 2005. Table 1 below
provides a summary of the original benchmarks and most recent estimates for each MDG
target. The absence of reliable data for the 2000-2004 period makes it difficult to assess
progress with respect to each indicator in the current millennium. However, as already
noted, momentum on many of the indicators was adversely affected during 2001-2003,
given the slowdown in growth and the slower pace of investments in social services and
basic infrastructure. Government plans to undertake a repeat of the 2000 ENCOVI
(living standards) survey in 2005, which should help provide a clearer picture of
developments in recent years.
11.
Overall, Guatemala’s capacity for measurement of development impacts remains
poor, and is beginning to be addressed by the current administration. The goal is to put in
place a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system aimed at establishing a clear
link between inputs and outcomes through the systematic use of public expenditure
information coupled with data from a regular program of household and other surveys as
well as service statistics. This effort is receiving support from a number of multilateral
donors, including the Bank, via the Integrated Financial Management (SIAF) Project and
a regional TFSCB grant project to prepare a national statistics strategy to guide the
prioritization of statistical programs needed to underpin the national monitoring and
evaluation system.
12.
In order to reduce extreme poverty by half between 2000 and 2015 and thus
accomplish the first of the Millennium Development Goals, Guatemala needs to both
increase growth and ensure that the benefits of growth reach the poor. Calculations
presented in the Bank’s recent CEM indicate that to meet the extreme poverty MDG by
2015, the economy needs to grow at a per capita rate of at least 2.4 percent or
approximately 5 percent per annum in real terms. This is a higher rate than was foreseen
as necessary in the 1990s, as quicker growth is now needed to compensate for the poor
performance of the 1999-2003 period (see below). In addition to growth¸ it is critical to
raise public spending on human development and infrastructure investments that facilitate
the participation of the poor in the growth process. Financing for specific programs in
the environment area would also be needed to ensure the accomplishment of other
MDGs.

ECONOMIC CONTEXT

13.
Growth and Stability. Despite its political troubles over the past several
decades, Guatemala has been relatively stable from a macroeconomic standpoint over
most of that period. As shown in Table 2, compared with the averages for Latin America
and the Caribbean (1960-1999), the coefficients of variation (and the volatility) of output
per capita for Guatemala are significantly lower. Inflation, too, has been well below the
Latin American average for each of the past four decades. With respect to growth,
however, the Guatemalan economy has long performed more poorly than the rest of the
region, with an especially poor record in the 1980s, when per capita income declined
drastically due to regional macroeconomic instability and the intensification of
Guatemala’s civil war. In the 1990s, the Guatemalan economy posted an annual average
growth rate of slightly over 4 percent per annum (1.4 percent per capita). While this pace
was a dramatic improvement over the previous decade, it was nonetheless a somewhat
disappointing outcome given high growth expectation following the cessation of the civil
war in 1996 and major structural reform efforts—in trade and financial sector
liberalization, private participation in telecommunications and power and increased
spending and policy improvements in education and health—ongoing since the mid1980s. Moreover, as indicated in Para 12 above, it fell short of the growth rates needed
to achieve the MDG target for poverty reduction. As already noted, the Bank’s CEM
indicates that the economy needs to grow at about 5 percent (2.4 percent per capita)
annually to achieve MDG targets.

In addition to the rebound in growth, the 1990s also saw a substantial decline in
volatility (by about two thirds, amounting to less than a third of the Latin American
average). This outcome largely reflects the positive effects of economic diversification,
since new emerging sectors are more stable than traditional agriculture, where price and
volume fluctuations are more pronounced. Lower volatility is also the result of more
stable macro management, as witnessed by Guatemala’s record of responsible fiscal and
monetary management since the late 1980s. The country’s ratio of public debt to GDP
has consistently remained one of the lowest in LAC and is currently below 20 percent.
8

This, in turn, largely explains Guatemala’s relatively good current sovereign bond rating:
only two notches below investment grade according to Moody’s, and 3 notches below
according to S&P. Guatemala’s level of public debt to tax revenues has also been kept at
low levels, despite a comparatively low tax to GDP ratio. Macro policies (such as the
liberalization of interest rates and the floating of the exchange rate) have been used
increasingly to dampen the impact of external shocks on the economy.
15.
Growth decline 1999-2003. Since 1999, growth rates have declined and
remained low, falling below the population growth rate during 2001-03, with probable
negative repercussions on the country’s already worrisome poverty rates. The
deceleration of the economy in the period 2001-03 was due to both external and internal
factors. Internally, the investment climate was negatively affected by a widespread lack
of confidence in the Portillo government associated with unpredictable changes in public
policy, deterioration in governance and a weakening of the rule of law—which, in turn,
gave rise to an intense conflict between the Government and significant segments of the
private sector. Moreover, the perception of widespread corruption in the last 2 years of
the Portillo Administration and the relaxation of fiscal discipline in 2003 (an election
year) also adversely affected Guatemala’s image at home and abroad. On the external
front, the terms of trade were negatively affected, mainly through a drastic and long-lived
collapse in the world price of coffee. Export revenues from this crop fell from close to
$580 million in 1999 to $268 million in 2002. The impact was most acute on the income
of a large number of laborers and coffee farmers since approximately 600,000
Guatemalans were directly and indirectly involved in the coffee business prior to the
price decline. In addition, recession in the U.S. and other trading partners in the 2000-02
period resulted in falling demand for Guatemalan exports, affecting most directly exports
of non-traditional maquila products. Aside from depressing exports, the downswing in
the U.S. economy may have also influenced economic activity in Guatemala through
investor sentiment and other channels, as traditionally swings in the U.S. economy have
tended to reverberate loudly in manufacturing activity.
16.
External balance. Slow growth in exports is a key factor in explaining the
sizeable trade imbalance of recent years, financed mainly by rapidly-growing workers
remittances. The latter stood at 8.5 percent of GDP in 2003 and are expected to continue
to rise in the medium term. The improvement in the trade/GDP ratio since 1991 has been
largely the result of the rapid growth of imports, which is at the root of Guatemala’s large
trade imbalances. As shown in Table 3, exports as a share of GDP continued to account
for less than 20 percent of GDP in 2001, with little improvement since the early 1990s.
However, the aggregate numbers hide important changes in the structure of exports, with
a booming maquila sector and a dynamic non-traditional agriculture export sector (e.g.,
flowers, seasonal vegetables, fruits and organic crops) yielding a more diversified trade
basket. The current account deficit has been declining since 2001, but it remains high at
about 4.3 percent of GDP at end 2004 and the latest estimates show an average current
account deficit of 3.9 percent of GDP for the rest of the CAS period. Overall, however,
Guatemala's external position remains stable. Due to the lack of good quality balance of
payments data in Guatemala, it is hard to infer from historical figures how much of the
current account has actually been financed by debt creating flows, as an important share
of private sector financing is believed to be unreported remittances and FDI. In addition,
9

there are no obvious signs of balance of payments instability in Guatemala, as the
international reserves position is currently very strong (equivalent to 5 months of imports
in 2004) and the total external debt (including private sector) remains at manageable
levels.

17.
Fiscal trends. Total public spending exhibited a marked increase after the Peace
Accords, rising from around 9 percent of GDP in 1994-96 to 13 percent in 1999 but the
ratio slipped again in 2003-04. The share to the social sectors has risen considerably over
the past 8 years. However, a much more significant increase in spending is needed for
key investments to reduce poverty and support economic growth, which, in turn, requires
a considerably higher level of revenues in order to be sustainable. Thus far, successive
governments have faced an uphill battle in their efforts to raise revenues up to the 12
percent Peace Accords target. Powerful vested interests have consistently opposed tax
initiatives in Congress or, in some instances, launched successful court challenges to
achieve the strike down of taxes approved by the legislature. After some progress in
2000-02 in raising the tax/GDP ratio, the ratio slipped again in 2003 as the courts
overturned some taxes. As a result, social spending slipped again from a high of 5.5
percent of GDP in 2001 to 5.2 percent on average for the 2002-03 period.
18.
Future challenges. Guatemala’s medium-term challenge is to boost growth, push
ahead with poverty reduction and address dismal social indicators. As discussed in a
recent Country Economic Memorandum, CEM (June 2004) prepared by the Bank, this
will require the creation of fiscal space to strengthen key public investment programs
(mainly in the social sectors and infrastructure), deepen some of the reforms of recent
years (including in strengthening the investment climate and public institutions), while
maintaining sound macroeconomic management. Inter alia, this agenda will likely
require stronger revenue measures to facilitate an increase in funding for critical
investments, while improving the effectiveness and targeting of spending.

Recent Developments. As discussed above (Para 4), the Berger administration
came into office with a strong commitment to pursue compliance with the Peace Accords,
while at the same time taking strong steps to attack corruption and improve the
investment climate for growth. During its first year, much of its energies in the economic
sphere had to focus on addressing serious fiscal troubles, as a Constitutional Court
decision in late 2003 struck down the presumptive income tax, the Impuesto a Empresas
Mercantiles y Agrícolas (IEMA) which, in 2003, had generated about half of all revenues
from enterprises. This decision, coupled with large spending commitments by the
outgoing administration, led to tax collection and fiscal deficit projections for 2004 of
under 9 percent of GDP and 4.5 percent of GDP. To address this impending crisis, the
government worked to obtain consensus on drastic actions on both the expenditure and
revenue fronts. On the former, it enacted substantial expenditure cuts (3 percent in
nominal terms) in all areas of the budget, with the exception of spending on education,
health, and housing, which grew by about 4 percent. The cuts included an unprecedented
11

reduction in the military by one-third (about 12,000 personnel) and a significant
downsizing of the civil service (by about 20 percent). On the revenue side, the
Government developed a package of tax policy reforms for Congressional approval in
mid-2004 and simultaneously began to address weaknesses in tax administration and
enforcement. The tax package met with only partial success in Congress, where it was
watered down in a number of areas. These reductions were, however, offset by a betterthan-expected outcome under the tax administration and, especially, enforcement, effort.
By end 2004, net revenue stood at 10.3 percent of GDP, unchanged from 2003. The
fiscal deficit was sharply reduced to 1 percent of GDP, allowing for a small financial
surplus for the combined public sector. Public expenditures were partially financed
through a 30-year, US$330 million Eurobond issue in September 2004, which was
heavily oversubscribed at 8.25 percent.
20.
At the core of Government’s fiscal policy for the remainder of its term is a twopronged strategy predicated on: (i) raising revenues towards the 12-percent target of the
Peace Accords; and (ii) maintaining low budget deficits while raising the efficiency of
public spending. Given the sharp compression in public spending in 2004, the
Government expects to boost its investment program in 2005 and 2006, in turn, implying
somewhat larger deficits of 1.8 and 1.5 percent of GDP, respectively. With regard to
revenue collections, the Government’s strategy going forward is to continue to strengthen
tax administration and enforcement under its 106-point plan (with technical assistance
from the Fund and from the Bank, through an ongoing tax administration project) and to
promote a second package of revenue measures in the next 10-18 months. Aware of stillsubstantial resistance to a stronger tax effort, the Government has launched a campaign to
promote public awareness and spearhead a national dialogue on the country’s social
objectives and needs, define their costs, and build consensus on the appropriate role for
the public sector in achieving them. Over the next several months, the plan is to engage a
wide range of interest groups in round table discussions on social priorities—including
the challenges and spending requirements of achieving the MDGs—and the sources of
funding available to meet them. In addition, the Government is continuing its efforts to
vigorously attack corruption and improve the impact and transparency of public
expenditures (with support from the Bank’s Integrated Financial Management Project and
an ongoing PER). This, inter alia, should help build confidence in the fiduciary role of
the Government in the use of public funds and, consequently, reduce opposition to a new
tax effort. Finally, as part of its regional integration objectives, the Government expects
to work with its Central American neighbors to harmonize taxes and duties.
21.
Growth Outlook. The overall outlook for economic growth improved with the
incoming Berger Administration due both to the government's anti-corruption, probusiness stance and a favorable international context. Growth in 2004 reached 2.7 percent
(just above population growth rates for the first time in 3 years). Looking ahead, the
potential ratification of the free trade agreement with the U.S. (DR-CAFTA), and the
deepening of regional integration efforts that the Berger administration has been leading
within Central America, offer significant opportunities for attracting new investment and
fostering trade-led growth, particularly if they are accompanied by complementary
reforms. Clearly, higher growth levels of the magnitude needed to meet Peace Accords

12

targets require a resumption of reforms as outlined in the Bank’s recent CEM,
particularly those related to strengthening governance (including contract enforcement
and protection of property rights), the regulatory framework (for PPI and labor), and the
competitiveness agenda (including education/human development, infrastructure, finance
and regional integration). Many of these are addressed in the Government’s plan for
economic and social reactivation –Vamos Guatemala!, discussed below.

III. KEY ISSUES AND GOVERNMENT PLANS
22.
As already mentioned the Berger Government is deeply conscious of the
challenges facing Guatemala and has laid out its priorities for reactivating social and
economic development within the framework of the Peace Accords. Its policy document,
Vamos Guatemala! (Let’s go, Guatemala!), was launched in August 2004 and lays out an
ambitious program for building social solidarity, competitiveness and trust. The key
elements of the plan are shown diagrammatically in Chart 1 below.
Chart 1: Diagram of “Vamos Guatemala ! ”

*Adapted from Government of Guatemala Presentation.

23.
As shown in Chart 1, Vamos Guatemala comprises four main areas for action
during the remainder of the Berger Administration’s term. At the base are a set of
fundamentals aimed at addressing the foundations of the national development program

13

which comprise: a stable macroeconomic framework, security (including both citizen
security with respect to crime and violence and legal security–access to speedy justice);
and improved governance and public sector institutions. Resting on this foundation are
three strategic pillars as follows:
•

•

•

Guate Solidaria – aimed at promoting social solidarity, reduced inequality and
greater economic integration through strengthening social protection/nutrition
programs for vulnerable groups, accelerating investments in education and health
and development of social-economic infrastructure in indigenous and rural areas
as a means of reducing inequality and creating opportunities;
Guate Crece/Compite – aimed at accelerating growth to above the 4 percent
observed in the 1990s, this component of the strategy emphasizes trade
expansion, financial sector strengthening, improved investment climate, export
promotion, public-private partnerships for investments in housing and
infrastructure (principal roads, ports and airports, renewable energy),
development of high potential sectors (e.g., tourism and forestry), support for
micro, small and medium enterprises and greater attention to promotion of quality
standards and technological innovation;
Guate Verde – aimed at promoting sustainable development including building
central and sub-national capacity for environmental analysis, assessment and
monitoring, strengthening protected areas management, conserving bio-diversity
and preservation of social and cultural heritage.

In addition to the above components, and recognizing the constraints imposed by the
small size of the state, the Vamos Guatemala strategy formally incorporates a crosscutting emphasis on the development of public-private (both business and community
groups) partnerships across all areas of public action. The following sections lay out in
more detail the challenges facing Guatemala in each of these areas and describe the
Government’s strategy to address them.
A.

STRENGTHENING FUNDAMENTALS

24.
As noted above, the Vamos Guatemala plan highlights, as a foundation for an
accelerated and inclusive development path, the need for macroeconomic stability, legal
and personal security and improved governance and public sector management, including
the strengthening of municipal governments and the decentralization of administrative
responsibilities. Section II of this report (paras 13-21) has already provided a discussion
of macroeconomic trends in Guatemala and the Berger Administration’s main
commitments with respect to macroeconomic management, especially fiscal
management, which will not be repeated here. In February 2005, an IMF Article IV
assessment mission concluded that economic performance improved in 2004, with a
moderate recovery of growth and a significant strengthening of the external position.
Overall, the mission indicated that the Government’s macroeconomic management to
date has been satisfactory and plans for continued improvements to the country’s fiscal
situation were judged to be essentially sound.

14

25.
As might be expected in the aftermath of centuries of discrimination and a 36year civil conflict, justice issues are a key component of the development agenda in
Guatemala. Recognizing this, the Government’s Vamos Guatemala strategy places high
priority on promoting the legal and personal security of the Guatemalan population.
Although much remains to be done, legal security and judicial reform is an area of the
Peace Accords agenda where Guatemala has made significant progress. Key advances
include: (i) the establishment of a judicial presence in all 331 municipalities (versus only
about 100 in 1990); (ii) establishment of a civilian police force separate from the military;
(iii) separation of functions between the judge and the prosecution and establishment of a
public defense system, which now covers over 10% of cases; (iv) separating the Public
Ministry from the Office of the General Procurator’s office, which defends the interests
of the state; (v) establishment of 20 centers nationwide to mediate minor conflicts in
extra-judicial hearings, thereby speeding up the administration of justice and (vi)
establishment of a commission on family violence and strengthening of the ombudsman
office for indigenous women. Moreover, there has been a significant increase in the
employment of women judges (up from 3% to 17% of the total over the past 4-5 years)
and indigenous staff (with Mayan language speakers up from 100 to 1000 in the same
period)—key factors in increasing the accessibility of justice for vulnerable groups. In
2004, the new government has launched anti-corruption and training drives in both the
armed forces and police forces, in part with donor assistance. It is also promoting the
organization of department-level citizen security councils to tackle violent crime (Box B).
Box B: Crime and Violence
Eight years after the signing of the Peace Accords, generalized violence remains a major
concern. Recent surveys indicate that violence ranks high on the list of the population’s as
well as firms’ concerns. Different sources agree that crime and violent activities have
increased over the last three years. For instance, the average number of monthly human rights
violations verified by MINUGUA increased from 231 in 1998 to 489 in 2002, while the
number of crimes registered by the Organismo Judicial increased more than 75% from 2002
to 2003. Problems are also faced with organized crime, related, in turn, to drug-dealing
activities and corruption, and to maras (youth gangs) which according to the police now
comprise 434 groups spread throughout the country, but especially in Guatemala City.
Widespread availability of firearms is also a key concern. To address crime, the Berger
Government has, inter alia, focused on conducting permanent policing operations in 40 focal
points considered most dangerous—employing around 3,800 police and military agents. It is
also undertaking a full-scale evaluation of the performance of the Oficina de Responsabilidad
Policial y Servicio de Investigacion Criminal. More emphasis is also being placed on crime
and violence prevention interventions, focusing at the local level and targeting risk factors
such as easy access to firearms, school drop-outs, family and media violence and
unemployment. These efforts are still in an initial phase, and violence remains a major
problem in Guatemalan society, affecting ordinary citizens and businesses alike.

26.
Although much has been achieved (partly with assistance from the Bank-financed
Judicial Reform Project and a number of other donors), much remains to be done. There
are still significant problems with inefficiency and delays in the tribunals. Sentencing can
take up to 3 years from the original accusation and as a result, the increased arrest rate

15

has led to a sharp upturn in the percentage of prisoners without sentence, to around 50
percent. Another outstanding issue is the independence of the Public Ministry and the
Attorney General (Fiscal General). Additionally, as noted in the 2004 CEM, there is an
urgent need for the creation of extra-judicial adjudication processes for the quicker
settlement of contract disputes as a key component of improving the business climate and
contributing to the country’s economic growth agenda. Finally, given the involvement of
many donors in the reform of the justice sector, there is a need to improve donor
coordination in this sector in support of the Government’s strong commitment to continue
advancing with citizen security and access to justice.
27.
With respect to governance and public sector management, the Guatemalan
Government is committed to implementing a major program for modernization of the
state as a key element of forging higher levels of trust between government and the
public and in promoting business investment. A major thrust in this regard is on
continuing to improve the quality of public sector financial management, through the
adoption and efficient use of an integrated public sector financial management system,
called SIAF. Since its inception in 1996, SIAF has developed treasury, accounting and
budgeting modules, all of which have helped increase the efficiency and transparency of
central government operations. It has also contributed to increased transparency and the
reduction of opportunities for corruption. Quarterly reports of budgetary execution are
now published on the Finance Ministry’s website and the Contraloría General de
Cuentas (CGC), the public office for external audit of government agencies, has direct
access to the system, on line in real time. An internet-based procurement system,
Guatecompras, is also now being rolled out to all central government agencies. Pending
actions for strengthening procurement include: amending the procurement law in order to
streamline processes, improving efficiency and ensuring consistency with international
standards, strengthening the Contraloría, creating specialized procurement units in line
ministries and decentralized entities, establishing a career track for procurement officials
in the context of a reformed civil service law, and amplifying the use of e-procurement
through the Guatecompras website. Another high priority for Government is the
introduction of e-government services and the extension of both the SIAF and
Guatecompras systems to all municipalities by the end of the administration. In 2004,
some 40 municipalities have begun to use the systems.
28.
Municipal development and decentralization were important priorities of the
Peace Accords both as a means of promoting social cohesion and increasing the
accountability of the Government. Guatemala has made important advances in these
fields during the last decade, including the passage of the 2003 Decentralization Law and
the revision of the Municipal Code. Currently, municipalities depend on transfers from
central government or development assistance (often channeled through the Municipal
Development Institute, INFOM) to finance their capital budgets, and are stretched to
cover their basic operating expenditures from local revenues. The constitution mandates
that 10% of all fiscal income be transferred to municipalities, and the 1995 Law of Urban
and Rural Development Councils (Consejos de Desarrollo Urbano y Rural, CDUR)
mandates a transfer of 2% of the income from sales tax to these councils. However, the
temptation to top-up central government transfers and development assistance with

16

borrowing is considerable and large municipalities such as Guatemala City have already
done this to a considerable extent. So municipal debt is a lingering issue in Guatemala
and may become a fiscal problem in the future. The strengthening of municipal tax bases
through cadastre work (such as that undertaken with Bank support in the Peten region) is
therefore important to the future of fiscal decentralization. The Government is developing
a municipal tax code to address some of these issues.
29.
The idée-force of the CDURs is to inject a participatory approach to policy
making at all levels of government, which is congruent with the Peace Accords agenda.
The CDURs have national, departmental, municipal and local fora. The departmental
entities are considered the strongest at this stage of their development. However, there is
a danger that, since central government plays an important role in deciding the
configuration of the CDURs, they might be used as parallel structures to undermine the
position of local governments which are in conflict with the national government (e.g.
those controlled by the opposition). There is a need to develop a more coherent overall
vision of the role of different entities at a local level (municipalities, CDURs, private and
community organizations) and to define their responsibilities with respect to provision of
social and basic services in the context of the national development strategy.
B.

GUATE SOLIDARIA: REDUCING INEQUALITY & PROMOTING SOCIAL INCLUSION

30.
The Guate Solidaria component of the Vamos Guatemala program is focused on
actions aimed at reducing inequality and increasing social inclusion—one of the central
challenges for the country’s development agenda. For many years, the civil conflict
placed large swathes of the country beyond the scope of basic services and social
programs and the country’s limited fiscal base has severely constrained the amount that
could be spent on social programs without leading to macroeconomic instability. As
discussed in Section II above, notwithstanding some important gains since the Peace
Accords were signed, Guatemala’s poverty and social indicators remain among the worst
in the region, and are far worse than would be expected given the country’s per capita
GDP. As also noted previously, indicators in Guatemala are particularly bad for the
country’s indigenous groups and for the rural population more generally. Even among
these groups, women tend to suffer the most discrimination as evidenced by high
maternal mortality rates and lower levels of literacy among women. In this context,
investing in social services and rural infrastructure is a major emphasis of the Vamos
Guatemala strategy, and Government’s commitment was demonstrated in 2004 by
increased budget allocations for social spending, despite an overall extremely tight fiscal
situation. Further increases in social expenditures are planned throughout the presidential
term, rising from 5 percent of GDP in 2004 to over 6 percent by 2007. Steps are also
being taken to increase the efficiency and targeting of social expenditure through
improved linking of expenditures to outcomes and a variety of other measures being
identified through ongoing work under the Bank-supported SIAF Project as well as a
Public Expenditure Review (PER) which is currently nearing completion.
31.
Human Development. Over the past decade, Guatemala has made important
strides in increasing access to education and has a high probability of meeting the

17

Millennium Development Goals in the area of primary education. The Peace Accords
goals for basic education coverage and expenditure were both met by 2000. Education
spending rose from 1.6 to 2.5% of GDP between 1995 and 2000, against a goal of 2.5%
for 2000. Net coverage in primary education rose from 70% in 1996 to just under 90% in
2001; and for preschool it rose from 20% to 45%. The net coverage of secondary
education also improved, but remains very low, having risen from 18% in 1996 to 28% in
2001 for the third cycle (básica secundaria) and from 11% to 16% for the fourth cycle
(diversificada). Low education levels are a key constraint to both growth and poverty
reduction, as discussed extensively in the Bank’s 2004 CEM.
32.
Guatemala’s PRONADE program for parent-managed schools has made an
important contribution to the increase in basic education coverage over the last decade,
providing at present for over 350,000 students. By 2001, PRONADE was providing 13%
of all primary education places in Guatemala (up from 2% in 1996); and 12% of
preschool places (up from 3.6%). A recent evaluation of PRONADE by USAID showed
that parents have a higher level of satisfaction than in ordinary schools and that teachers’
attendance is markedly better (on average 165 of the programmed 180 days, compared
with 135 in other schools). The fact that PRONADE schools are in more remote areas
and serve poorer communities would lead to an expectation of worse results, however,
standardized testing shows that educational outcomes in PRONADE schools are similar
to those in traditional schools.

funding to the program. As
Guatemala moves towards the
mainstreaming of community participation in basic education, the issue of differential
remuneration rates will need to be addressed. The new government is strongly committed
to the program and has expressed its intention to generalize community involvement in
basic education and promote parental involvement in the regulation of teacher
performance in traditional schools. The government is also committed to continuing with
the development of bilingual education—another critical issue for effective education
access in Guatemala, where a significant proportion of the population are not native
Spanish speakers and where the primary enrollment rate among the indigenous
population (75 percent) is lower than that of the ladino population (84 percent). Finally,
a program of scholarships has been established to promote girls’ enrollment.

18

34.
A key challenge for the future is to address efficiency and quality issues in both
the traditional and PRONADE models. It will be critical to strengthen quality across the
board, through an effective pedagogical supervision system and universal standardized
testing. The extension of secondary education coverage is another vital challenge being
taken up by the Berger administration. Presently, only 25% of children of secondary age
are enrolled in school (46% in urban and 12% in rural areas). These ratios are markedly
worse than those of neighboring Central American countries and, as noted in the Bank’s
CEM, threaten to leave Guatemala unable to compete in terms of labor quality. Finally,
some headway is being made through a donor round-table to strengthen external
coordination in the education sector where USAID, UNICEF, UNESCO, GTZ, KfW,
UNDP, Canada, Spain, Norway, Plan International and the Bank are all active.
35.
Although they have shown an improving trend over the last 15 years, Guatemala’s
health outcomes remain severely inferior to what would be expected for its level of percapita income, and only about half the population has effective access to a health facility.
As with other social sector indicators, the urban-rural and indigenous-non indigenous
disparities in health outcomes are striking. There is a clear need to increase the coverage
of maternal and child health services (including family planning), improve immunization
coverage from its current level of about 62% and strengthen educational programs related
to environmental health. There is also a growing challenge from the HIV-AIDs
pandemic, with Guatemala reporting a 1% HIV infection incidence among adults, 6th in
the Latin American ranking. If present trends are allowed to continue, this will rise to
1.7% by 2010. Public health spending is 2.3% of GDP—the lowest level in the Central
American region—and health’s share of public spending declined from 8.8% to 6.4%
between 1997 and 2003. The 2005 budget has increased allocations for health, but
further substantial increases are needed to bring health spending into line with other
similar countries. Parallel improvements in sectoral management improvements would
also be needed, however, to achieve the desired outcomes.
36.
Perhaps the most striking challenge of all is the high rate of malnutrition among
Guatemala’s children. Guatemala reports far worse indicators than the rest of the region,
and is comparable to Nepal, Pakistan and Rwanda. Among the leading causes of this
poor outcome are: the lack of nutritional education among parents, the nutritional impact
of infectious illnesses in early childhood, the lack of access to basic services (such as
water and sanitation) leading to more illnesses, and insufficient or poor quality food as a
result of income poverty. Government has placed high priority on reducing malnutrition
in young children—aiming to eliminate it in children under three years of age. To this
end it has appointed a special Anti-Hunger Commissioner and a related secretariat to
coordinate a multi-sectoral approach to combating it. It is also developing a nation-wide
community-based program for nutrition education and related health services, building on
successful pilot experiences undertaken by the Sugar Foundation in Guatemala and by
other Central American countries, particularly the AIN-C program in Honduras. The
program is being implemented in 41 of the most vulnerable municipalities in a first
phase, with a plan for step-wise expansion to establish a nation-wide program.
37.
Rural Infrastructure Services. Since the Peace Accords were signed,
Guatemala has achieved important advances in the coverage of infrastructure services
19

throughout the country, including in rural areas. Nevertheless, there are still large
coverage gaps, and the improved coverage has not yet resulted in significant changes in
the rural economy. Table 5 below summarizes the present level of coverage and quality
issues for rural infrastructure services.
38.
The upgrading of rural roads and institutionalizing effective maintenance in this
sub-sector is a key challenge for Guatemala which, if successfully met, will have a
decisive impact on the rural economy. Eleven different agencies are active in building or
maintaining rural roads in Guatemala. But there is strong emphasis on building and
rebuilding. Only 4 percent of Guatemala’s 19,000 km of rural roads benefited from
routine maintenance activity in 2002, while 24 percent benefited from periodic
maintenance (rehabilitation). Legally, rural roads in Guatemala are the responsibility of
the municipalities but, in the past, little municipal maintenance activity has taken place.
There is a need to involve municipal governments in project implementation and
establish an ongoing municipal commitment for maintenance activities. Given the
importance of rural roads for poverty reduction and the serious institutional issues still
needing to be resolved, the Government plans to intensify its efforts in this sub-sector.
The Bank-supported successful rural roads project with INFOMAM/ADIMAN in San
Marcos offers a model in which municipalities are encouraged to co-finance
rehabilitation and then “adopt” the road, providing routine maintenance through microenterprises. The Government intends to continue to work with municipal associations to
upgrade and maintain access roads to remote communities, channeling locally controlled
resources to complement the investments. The role of INFOM in resource administration
would be gradually reduced, as municipal associations acquire the capacity to assume it.

39.
In water and sanitation the key challenge facing Government is reaching 2
million people who are still without services. The responsibility for providing water and
sanitation services in Guatemala rests with the municipalities. The municipal
development institute, INFOM, has developed a Basic Model for the provision of rural

20

water and sanitation services based on the principle of accommodating the specification
of the service to the preferences of the community. The model promotes the use of
appropriate technology for reaching dispersed populations and emphasizes the
importance of the financial sustainability of the systems, through the recovery of costs
from the users. Community organizations and micro enterprises play an important role in
the provision of the services and of TA to providers and emphasis is placed on linking
water supply and sanitation provision to health promotion, in order to maximize impacts.
40.
Coverage growth in electricity has been very rapid since electricity distribution
was privatized. A $333 million fund was created to fund rural electrification, using the
$101 million from the sale of the state companies plus a $90 million IDB loan and
government funds. This has led to an increase in coverage from 77 percent to 91 percent
in the four-year interval 2000-2004, almost entirely on grid. However 300,000 of the
poorest households remain without coverage. Among the options being considered are
the creation of municipal associations to provide off-grid services and the development of
cost-effective renewable energy supply options where this is feasible. There is also a need
to address serious problems in the unsustainable subsidy system—whose benefits are not
well targeted or equitably distributed—that was established in the Social Tariff law in
2000. Together with the high “stranded costs” of the PPA generation contracts inherited
by the new system, this has led to profound financial stress. The continued rapid growth
of coverage will increase the subsidy burden and further stretch generation capacity. It is
also vital to ensure that off-grid solutions have access to subsidy on an equitable basis.
These issues need to be addressed to ensure the sustainability of the expansion.
41.
The benefits of the telecommunications privatization and liberalization reforms
program implemented by the Arzu Government are very clear. During the last decade the
number of fixed lines has risen from 400,000 to one million; and cellular phones, from
30,000 to 1.2 million. These improvements were due largely to changes in the legal and
regulatory framework and institutions (i.e., the Superintendencia de Telecomunicaciones
or SIT) that stimulated private sector competition and investment as well as the
establishment of a universal access program (i.e., FONDETEL) to stimulate private
sector investment in public payphones in rural areas. Nevertheless telecom access in
Guatemala—especially in rural areas—remains among the lowest in the region, and this
will continue to be the case without additional incentives despite growth of cell phone
networks. The Berger administration is committed to stimulating increased private sector
investment in telecommunications and information technologies (ICTs) by updating the
legal and regulatory framework to make it consistent with DR-CAFTA, to take into
account market and technological innovations and to encourage the use of ICTs to
improve governance, delivery of services and increase the competitiveness of
Guatemala’s economy. In order to address the growing urban-rural “digital divide”,
FONDETEL adopted a rural access strategy that uses output-based aid (OBA)
mechanisms aimed at fostering private sector provision to each municipality of at least
one internet access point that enables local governments, NGOs, private sector and
operators broad band access to the internet and to ensure that all rural localities have at
least one public payphone.

C.

GUATE CRECE/COMPITE: STIMULATING GROWTH & ENHANCING COMPETITIVENESS

42.
The second major pillar of the Vamos Guatemala! program, seeks to accelerate
economic growth and enhance competitiveness as key factors in reducing income
poverty. Although the 1990s saw a significant fall in the overall poverty rate from 65 to
56% and of extreme poverty from about 18 to 16%, it has since likely stagnated or
possibly increased slightly given the economic slow-down and reduced pace of social
spending in the 2001-03 period, when growth rates remained in the 2.1-2.2% range.
According to analyses undertaken in the Bank’s CEM, if per-capita growth can be
stabilized at 2.4% a year—consistent with GDP growth of 5% a year—the extreme
poverty rate could be reduced from 16% in 2003 to 9% in 2015 (MDG target). To make
headway on poverty reduction, the Government is committed to complementing actions
to reduce inequality (under Guatesolidaria) with a concerted effort to raise GDP growth
to 5% or at least the 1990s rate of 4%.
43.
Two key elements of accelerating Guatemala’s long-term growth prospects are
sustained investment in human capital development and rural infrastructure—priorities
which are also central to the Guate Solidaria pillar of the Vamos Guatemala! Plan as
discussed above. Two additional major elements of the growth agenda—improving
governance/efficiency in public institutions and combating crime and violence—are core
components of the plan’s “Fundamentals”. The Guate Crece/Compite pillar thus focuses
on a number of other major areas for addressing bottlenecks to growth and investment
including: (i) strengthening property rights, (ii) further strengthening and deepening the
financial sector, (iii) taking advantage of trade opportunities, (iv) improving the business
climate, (v) promoting PPI for major infrastructure projects, (vi) facilitating technology
and innovation, and (vii) supporting the growth of micro, small and medium enterprises.
These priorities, discussed further below, are fully consistent with the recommendations
of two recent Bank reports: the Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) completed in
June 2004 and the Investment Climate Assessment (ICA), based on a survey of firms
completed at the end of 2003 (see Box C).
Box C: Guatemala Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) Findings
As the Portillo Administration completed its term of office in late 2003, the Bank conducted a survey of the
investment climate involving more than 500 firms from 12 sectors in five principal cities. The survey
included micro, small, medium and large firms, with a supplementary study of 200 informal sector firms
also completed. The four areas of “major to severe concern” for the surveyed firms at the time were
corruption, regulation and informality (81%), crime and violence (80%), political and economic uncertainty
(66%) and macroeconomic instability (61%). The Investment Climate Survey (ICA) paints a portrait of an
antagonistic, inefficient and corrupt public sector and low levels of performance in the infrastructure so
important to efficient import of inputs and export of finished products. One of Guatemala’s few advantages,
labor productivity, is undercut by labor regulations and labor market rigidities. While reports of losses due
to electricity cuts is relatively low, the number of firms that has had to invest in their own generators is very
high. Air and highway shipping costs and customs combine to make it difficult for firms to take full
advantage of the new opportunities posed by DR-CAFTA. Although the ICA was conducted just prior to
the election of the new administration and reflects some of the antagonism between the private sector and
the Portillo Administration, it has been useful to the Berger Administration in pointing areas to focus
efforts and as a base-line measure against which to measure the impact of the current Government’s efforts
to improve the business climate.

22

44.
Property Rights. Fundamental to Guatemala’s growth agenda—as well as to the
achievement of increased social solidarity and a better business climate—is the question
of secure rights to land. Over the past several years, considerable progress has been
made on cadastral surveying and regularization of land—largely in urban, but also in
rural, areas. This progress is threatened however by limited titling and the transitory
nature of the institutional framework. For example, in the Department of Peten only
about a quarter of land parcels surveyed have been titled and registered reflecting both
the institutional weaknesses of the titling entities (municipalities for urban, and
FONTIERRAS for rural, land) and the transitory nature of the current cadastral process.
While some municipalities have started addressing the first problem by implementing
creative mechanisms to increase the number and speed of titling—e.g., reducing fees for
land adjudication or introducing gradual payment schemes—the legal framework for
cadastral registry remains inadequate. What is needed is the full integration of the
cadastre and the registry (Registro de la Propiedad), as well as measures to increase the
transparency and accountability of the registry itself. Government is now working
towards passage by Congress of a modern law of cadastre and land registry to enable
expansion of the pilot to the rest of the country. This is being given high priority by
Government given that the reform of land administration is central to Guatemala’s
development agenda. Indeed, Government has set an ambitious goal of completing
cadastral surveying of 75 to 80 percent of the populated land area by the end of its term.
45.
Financial Sector Strengthening. Guatemala has made significant progress in its
financial sector reform program following a banking crisis in 2001. At the core of the
reform program is a package of five financial sector laws approved by Congress between
October 2001 and April 2002: Monetary Law, Banking and Financial Groups Law, Bank
Supervision Law, Central Bank Law, and Money Laundering Law. These laws addressed
a number of deficiencies in the financial sector legal framework identified by the 2000
FSAP. In particular, they aimed at the following: (i) reform of the monetary policy legal
framework for the conduct of monetary and financial policy, including the capitalization
of the Central Bank, (ii) reform of the financial sector legal framework aimed at
strengthening the regulation of financial groups and creating an orderly market exit
mechanism, enhancing credit risk management, and increasing access to financing, (iii)
reform of bank supervision legal framework aimed at strengthening the autonomy of the
Superintendent of Banks and its legal and institutional capacity to supervise financial
groups, and raise banking sector regulation towards international standards, (iv)
enactment of legislation to prevent money laundering to reduce illegal activities and
comply with international norms. In addition, the reform program contemplates the
consolidation of the banking system through restructuring or closure of insolvent banks,
and through mergers and acquisitions, using the restructuring mechanism of the new
banking law.
46.
These reforms have contributed to making the banking system better able to
withstand external shocks and facilitate growth. In fact, Guatemala’s financial sector has
strengthened substantially since 2000, due to improvements in the prudential regulatory
framework and stepped-up onsite inspections, although the situation of the banks is still
fragile due to the low level of provisions and excessive amount of related lending. The

23

authorities have made progress in the licensing, supervision and registration of financial
conglomerates, including offshore banks which are now required to be part of licensed
conglomerates in order to operate. With assistance from a Bank TA loan, Guatemala is
also implementing a significantly strengthened anti-money laundering (AML) regime.
47.
To complete the modernization of the financial sector legal framework, the
Government has recently submitted to Congress a package of five bills of law and is
working in the preparation of another nine bills that should be ready for submission to
Congress later this year. The five bills recently submitted are: (i) The Law Against
Funding of Terrorism, which would make it a crime to fund terrorist activities.
Enactment of this law was a commitment taken by Guatemala when the Financial Action
Task Force (FATF) excluded Guatemala from the list of non-cooperating countries and
territories in July 2004; (ii) The Complementary Law for the Strengthening of the
Banking System, which, among other things, would remove tax impediments to the sale
of assets among banks and income generated by trusts; (iii) The Microfinance Law,
which would allow non-bank financial intermediaries to operate as lenders under
regulation and supervision by the Superintendent of Banks; and (iv) The Law of
Reciprocal Guarantees, which would provide the basis for the establishment of
associations that would provide collateral for its member companies to facilitate access to
credit; and (v) The Law of Movable Guarantees, which would facilitate the use and
repossession of non-traditional collateral, to facilitate access to credit. The other
financial sector bills of law under preparation include: Insurance Law, Pension Funds
Law, Leasing Law, Law to Protect Bank Creditor’s Rights, Law of Agricultural
Insurance, Factoring Law, Law of Investment Funds and Investment Banks and
Amendments to the Anti-Money Laundering Law and the Capital Markets Law.
48.
The new package of financial sector laws aims to increase prudent lending to
groups and enterprises today largely excluded from bank financing, such as micro, rural
and small and medium enterprises (SMEs). These proposed legal reforms need to be
complemented with further reforms of the legal, judicial and bankruptcy environment that
affect creditor rights and their judicial enforcement. An issue that requires further action
is the capitalization of the Central Bank by compensating it for policy-induced losses, as
required by the Central Bank Law. In addition, it is necessary to continue to strengthen
the capacity of the Superintendent towards implementation of Basle II-like supervision—
analysis of bank risks and implementation of risk-based consolidated supervision—
though not necessarily involving an explicit change towards that framework in the
immediate future.
49.
There are also a number of urgent outstanding issues in the banking sector that
Government is addressing as a matter of priority. These include: (i) low provisions in
offshore banks, (ii) the presence of illegal offshore banks operating in Guatemala (actions
to deal with two of them are underway), (iii) weaknesses in selected private banks, (iv)
steps to stem the losses of the state mortgage bank (CHN), (v) exempting the transfer of
bank assets from VAT, (vi) the high levels of related party lending throughout the
banking system and (vii) modernization of the payments system. Box D below provides
information on other key areas requiring attention in the short to medium term.

24

Box D: Strengthening the Financial Sector
In addition to the high priority actions discussed in Para 49, the following are other key steps in
continuing to strengthen Guatemala’s financial sector.
Bankruptcy Law. There is a need for a new Bankruptcy law to provide incentives for troubled
enterprises to inform early of their financial problems, and allow the restructuring of debts as an
alternative to liquidation.
Insurance Legislation and enhanced supervision. Insurance companies are a fundamental part of
the financial system, and their activities have potentially significant effects on the banking sector and
the payments system. A new insurance law should have the following characteristics: (i) reaffirm the
principle that insurance companies will be under the supervisory authority of the Superintendency of
Banks; (ii) incorporate the principle of consolidated supervision; (iii) establish a regime of sanctions
against risky practices; (iv) follow international supervision standards (issued by the International
Association of Insurance Supervisors); (v) allow local insurance firms to operate abroad and allow
foreign firms to operate in Guatemala; (vi) define clearly the functions and responsibilities of the
insurance intermediaries; (vii) establish norms for corporate governance; (viii) redefine the insurance
market; (ix) actualize the solvency parameters of insurance companies; (x) make information more
transparent; and (xi) establish an orderly market exit mechanism..
Capitalization of the Central Bank. The Central Bank Law establishes that the equity of
BANGUAT will be restored through the issuing of a 100 year zero-coupon bond to settle its fiscal
losses due to the cost of the monetary policies up to end 2001. As required by the Law, an audit was
conducted which determined that the debt to BANGUAT amounted to Q16,873 million. Congress
did not authorize the bond issue, although it did not involve any real financial cost to the Treasury.
The Government intends to re-introduce the bill to Congress although there is no definite time frame
for this The more important issue, however, is that the new losses suffered by BANGUAT after 2002
be compensated with performing bonds, as required by the Law and that the compensation
mechanism continues to be implemented in the future.

Trade and Regional Integration. Guatemala, along with four other Central
American countries and the Dominican Republic, is a signatory to DR-CAFTA, a free
trade agreement between the countries and the United States of America. Ratification is
pending by congresses and expected for 2005. In addition to trade in goods, DR-CAFTA
encompasses new rules for trade in services and rules and disciplines for investment
relations, and includes new areas such as anti-corruption norms, labor and environmental
standards and e-commerce. DR-CAFTA is likely to enhance market access for some
Guatemalan products, while making permanent the unilateral preferences offered in the
past through the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI). Little, if any, trade diversion is
expected since the U.S. has traditionally been the largest natural market for Guatemalan
exports, as well as its largest source of imports. While DR-CAFTA will provide
opportunities for accelerating development and growth in Guatemala—including through
attracting new investment to the country—complementary actions are required to derive
the maximum benefits (See Box E below). Guatemala has also been a leader in Central
America in the reduction of institutional barriers to trade in the region by working with
partners of the Central American Common Market on the terms for creating a customs
union. In recent months, Guatemala and El Salvador have been advancing on the regional

Box E: Actions to Maximize DR-CAFTA opportunities for Guatemala


Improve education levels and boost the quality and productivity of research efforts: DR-CAFTA is
likely to bolster FDI and imports with the capacity to improve technology and productivity. However to
reach full potential and enhance technological spillovers sufficient levels of human capital are needed. In
education this means that Guatemala needs to close its ‘skills gap’, by expanding coverage and quality of its
primary and secondary schooling system. It will need to boost the quality of its research institutions,
increase expenditures on R&D and develop links between public research and the private sector. Thus there
are important synergies between a functioning, innovative system and critical higher education initiatives.



Strengthen institutional development and improve governance: Deficiencies still exist in Guatemalan
institutions and governmental structures, particularly regarding the rule of law, personal security and
corruption. These weaknesses are part of the reason for the low growth yield of reforms throughout Latin
America in recent years. To reap the rewards of DR-CAFTA, continued improvement in institutions is
required, especially those aimed to improve the rule of law and fight corruption. This will require substantial
local efforts, as such improvements have not been automatic byproducts of free trade agreements.



Address deficiencies in infrastructure and customs efficiency: Deficiencies in Guatemalan infrastructure
such as road networks and ports need to be addressed to reap the potential gains of DR-CAFTA. In the area
of trade facilitation, Guatemala should focus on improving the customs environment and port efficiency.
Customs regulations should be streamlined and made more transparent. Ports require improved regulation,
enhancement of competition in port services and modern management practices.



Maintain sound fiscal management: Strengthening of fiscal policies and increased spending on social
sectors, infrastructure and security are important components of the strategy to improve the investment
climate in Guatemala. The agenda should focus on obtaining the required consensus to increase government
revenues in order to significantly boost required expenditures while retaining some flexibility in fiscal
policy to allow the pursuit of effective counter cyclical policies (Perry et. al., 2003).

•

Leverage DR-CAFTA to increase and diversify FDI: Establishing Invest in Guatemala (IIG) is a first
step in effectively leveraging DR-CAFTA for FDI. The Government must now follow through on
implementation. The efforts to improve the investment environment need to take into consideration the
needs of new sectors being targeted by IIG. This can be coordinated through the creation of a national
investment promotion strategy that incorporates government and private sector and outlines a vision for FDI
in the medium term. IIG must lead this process and to do so must have long term financing that takes it
beyond the current loan-supported budget and provides a more elevated profile in the national dialogue.



Broadening the benefits of DR-CAFTA: Attention is also required to ensure that the transition to new
relative prices is not accompanied by a large increase in temporary unemployment. In particular, for poor
households highly dependent on sensitive agricultural commodities, technical assistance programs will be
required to facilitate technological upgrading, crop substitution or assistance in moving out of agriculture,
complemented by actions to spur the development of deeper financial markets. This process should be
facilitated by the grace periods of up to 10 years before tariffs begin to drop for sensitive crops that were
accorded in DR-CAFTA. In addition, to ensure that benefits spread beyond large companies, actions to
support SME will be required, particularly in expanding their access to finance. Deepening trade and other
links with regional neighbors through the CACM will improve allocation of resources in the region and
provide economies of scale needed to launch new viable export ventures (like the recent customs union with
El Salvador). Further progress in reaching FTAs with Canada, the European Union and with other Latin
American countries through FTAA will further broaden economic integration and minimize any possible
trade diversion effects from existing FTAs. A related issue is the continuing international pressure for the
removal of tax incentives in free trade zones. In the medium run, Guatemala will need to replace these
incentives by an improved investment climate that can compensate for lost advantages to established firms.

to share customs revenue in order to eliminate customs posts in common borders.
49.
Business Climate and Competitiveness. A primary focus of the Government’s
agenda for competitiveness is improving the country’s investment and business climate.
Within this theme, an important emphasis is placed on reducing the costs of doing
business through: (i) simplification of regulations and clarification of rules for dealing
with customs, tax administration and labor matters, (ii) creation of a one-stop shop for
business registrations, (iii) speeding up customs procedures at key airports and ports and
(iv) improving the operations and organizational efficiency of ports and airports—
including securing a FAA Category 1 rating for the country’s main international airport
through a program of capacity building and technology upgrades. Related initiatives to
encourage investment and the competitiveness of firms include strengthening of national
systems in quality (with accredited laboratories, linked to a United States Agriculture
Department project), improvement and dissemination of economic and business
information and statistics, strengthening of capacity for worker training and promoting ecommerce. Advances have already been made in each of these areas, in part with
assistance from the Bank’s Competitiveness Enhancement Project. Steps are also being
taken to build consensus for, and pass, a domestic competition law, including a system
for consumer protection.
50.
Another critical area concerns the promotion of foreign direct investment (FDI).
Invest in Guatemala (IIG) leads this effort with assistance from MIGA. The agency is in
the process of finalizing its promotion strategy that is highlighting light manufacturing,
tourism, call centers/business process outsourcing and agribusiness. When it is completed
the strategy will outline targets for new investments, job creation, indirect employment,
and the expected impact of these FDI flows on exports. In the next two years IIG is
seeking to effectively measure the amount of local value added. This will set a
benchmark to implement programs that increase linkages between the local private sector
and international investors operating in Guatemala to provide goods and services that
further increase local value added.
51.
To ensure institutional coordination in the competitiveness area, the Government
has created an Office of the Presidential Commissioner for the Promotion of National
Competitiveness (Pronacom) and established a system of monthly meetings between
Pronacom, the Ministry of Economy, and representatives of the private sector,
universities and civil society, to review and monitor work plans and progress achieved.
Pronacom is part of a Central American network of government competitiveness
agencies, allowing the region to coordinate closely as it faces the challenges presented by
the DR-CAFTA agreement. In carrying out its mandate, Pronacom has developed a
strategy of alliances with key local partners such as Agexpront and the tourism sector as
well as close connections with regional and international institutions such as INCAE, the
USDA, the World Bank Group and the UN system. Thus far, Pronacom is holding itself
to a high standard of performance, with concrete indicators in priority areas for the
private sector and DR-CAFTA. The coming into office of the Berger Government
already improved Guatemala’s World Economic Forum competitiveness ranking—80 out

27

of 104 countries in 2004 versus 89 out of 102 in 2003—largely reflecting increased
confidence in macroeconomic management and in public sector institutions. However,
the Government recognizes that there is clearly a long way to go to make Guatemala a
very attractive country for investors, with a supportive and efficiently managed business
environment.
52.
Infrastructure. On the supply side of the economy, the Government’s growth
strategy places strong emphasis on increased investments in low-income housing and
infrastructure (roads, ports and airports, renewable energy), through developing publicprivate alliances for both financing and implementation. With respect to housing, the
Government is seeking approaches to designing guarantee schemes to stimulate private
sector credit for housing finance—a model which could be applied to other urban
infrastructure services, if implemented successfully. In addition, the Government has
proposed a series of large infrastructure projects to be implemented via public private
partnerships. These include: link roads in the northern and Pacific corridors, a
metropolitan beltway, and the construction of a freeway from Guatemala City to El
Rancho, as well as the development of the Champerico port. The Government intends to
present a framework law on concessions to the Congress in the first half of 2005 as well
as a law facilitating private participation in the construction of a major northern link-road
connecting some of the poorest areas of the country. Efforts are also underway to
establish partnerships with the private sector to improve management of key
infrastructure such as airports and ports. One step already taken with respect to the main
international airport in Guatemala City (La Aurora) has been to establish a management
committee comprised of users (including airlines, cargo companies, the tourism agency
etc.) and representatives of the civil aviation authority for better management of the
airport. As noted above, action is also being undertaken to upgrade La Aurora to a
Category I airport, enabling direct flights (both cargo and passenger) to U.S. destinations
by Guatemalan carriers.
53.
Technology and Innovation. As part of the effort to increase the productivity of
Guatemalan businesses, the Guatemalan Government is also emphasizing means of
encouraging the adoption of new technologies and supporting the process of
innovation—an area in which it is lagging badly. In addition to the appointment of a
Presidential Commissioner for Science and Technology, the Government is in the process
of developing a program to link universities and research centers with the private sector
in order to stimulate the research and development process in Guatemala. Another key
priority is the reform of the national training system, led by INTECAP as a means of
raising the skills level of the labor force. The main goal is to reduce INTECAP’s role
from a provider of in-service training for employees of businesses into a regulator and
certifier of training programs organized and implemented by the private sector within the
firms themselves. A third goal is to reorient the focus of the Council of Science and
Technology towards improved technological diffusion among small- and medium-sized
enterprises and expand the role of the private sector in its advisory board. In addition,
consideration is being given to the design of a system of incentives to promote the
acquisition of new technology via capital goods purchases, technology licensing
arrangements and other appropriate mechanisms.

28

54.
Support for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). A major focus
for the Government’s growth agenda—and one which is central to fostering inclusive
growth—is providing support for the expansion of MSMEs in both rural and urban areas.
In addition to actions mentioned above to improve infrastructure in rural and poorer
urban neighborhoods, increase access to the banking sector and reduce red tape, the core
strategy includes support to innovative local initiatives, with a special emphasis on rural
outreach, including: a matching grant system to improve the competitiveness of firms,
clusters, associations; the strengthening of “grupos gestores” (voluntary associations of
local businessmen) to participate in local-level economic development plans in
partnership with local development councils; and implementation of a successful rural
competition pilot. In addition special efforts are being made to reach out to indigenous
entrepreneurs through the Association of Mayan Entrepreneurs and support to CECMA
to create an Indigenous Competitiveness Research Center. Working with Agexpront and
other partners, the Government is also seeking to establish a network of “infocenters”
equipped with internet connectivity throughout the rural areas of the country to enable
easier access to market and other information. Several infocenters have already been set
up with assistance from USAID and an effort is underway to promote awareness of the
program and its potential uses to farm and non-farm entrepreneurs in the surrounding
areas. In addition to these efforts, technical support is being provided via the Ministry of
Agriculture in partnership with private organizations to equip farm businesses with
knowledge and inputs to diversify production and market their products.
55.
Linked to the effort to support MSMEs, is a concerted effort to develop integrated
strategies for the promotion of high-potential sectors with important backward and
forward linkages. The initial focus is on tourism—a sector which might be expected to
benefit a range of population groups through employment creation in both rural and
urban areas. Overall objectives within the national tourism plan are to transform the
country into a world class tourist destination through (i) working with the private sector
to develop sectoral policy, (ii) implement a coordinated strategy to facilitate promotion of
the country to the regional and overseas tourism industry, (iii) develop new tourist sites
(e.g., the archaeological site at Mirador) in an environmentally sustainable fashion, and
(iv) involve local communities and entrepreneurs in the development of tourism services.
To ensure adequate high-level attention, the Government has put in place a Tourism
Cabinet to play a strategic role in coordinating actions and programs of the different
institutions with a stake in the sector. A second area in which the Government expects to
focus is forestry, with efforts to develop a range of eco-certified forest products.

D.

GUATEVERDE: MAINSTREAMING ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS

56.
The third pillar of the “Vamos Guatemala” strategy aims to help ensure the longterm sustainability of the country’s development program through systematic attention to
environmental considerations. It also seeks to facilitate compliance with global
environmental commitments, particularly those related to the Millennium Development
Goals. At this stage, it is anticipated that Guate Verde will operate at three levels: (i) the

29

macro level, where it will ensure that environmental concerns are incorporated into
sectoral policies and strategies implemented under the other pillars of Vamos Guatemala,
(ii) the meso level, by ensuring proper coordination between the Ministry of Environment
& Natural Resources (MARN) as the lead agency and other institutions involved in
environmental issues at the national, regional and local level (e.g. CONAP, INAB,
municipalities); and (iii) the grass-roots level, by supporting the municipal capacitybuilding process in order to ensure the effectiveness of the Environmental Management
System. Specific areas for action are summarized below.
57.
An immediate priority in the environmental agenda concerns strengthening
environmental governance. Although an enabling and positive regulatory framework
currently exists for natural resource management—including agrarian, environmental,
biodiversity, protected areas and forestry policy and laws—there are some important
regulations related to the Environmental Protection and Improvement Law, which will
need to be developed, approved and implemented to make the policy framework more
operational. These include regulations related to Residual Waters and the Prevention of
Noise Pollution. In addition, in order to maximize the potential benefits of DR-CAFTA
(and other free trade agreements) the Government is committed to adapting current
environmental regulations so as to fully comply with DR-CAFTA stipulations.
58.
Another priority is to strengthen the institutional capacity of the central level
institutions responsible for natural resource policy formulation and oversight (MAGA,
MARN, INAB, CONAP). As a relatively “young” ministry, there is a clear need to
develop the capacity of MARN—the lead environmental protection institution—to
implement established policies through strengthening its own organizational structure,
internal regulations, and operational manuals. Another key priority is the strengthening of
the Integrated Environmental Management System, in which MARN has a lead role, but
which requires the active involvement of other organizations such as CONAP (National
Protected Areas Commission), and INAB (National Forestry Institute). Part of this
challenge is to develop institutionalized instruments for delivery of decentralized and
privatized public services for natural resource management, given a lack of practical
mechanisms and institutional arrangements for implementation of policies through
cooperation and coordination with private organizations, local governments and
communities. In addition, environmental monitoring, including of disaster risks, needs
to be strengthened, inter alia, via development of: (i) a Strategic Environmental
Information System and, (ii) jointly with SEGEPLAN, an Environmental Monitoring and
Evaluation System. In addition, to improve protection of vulnerable groups, the
government aims to set up early warning systems and promote environmental education
campaigns, starting with the 41 municipalities with highest levels of environmental risk.
59.
As referred to above, a key objective of the Guate Verde pillar is to decentralize
environmental management, through the strengthening of municipal governments and
the local traditional Mayan authorities (e.g., Alcaldias Auxiliares) to facilitate the
development of municipal level “sustainable development agendas” for natural resource
use and conservation by means of participatory priority-setting mechanisms and land use
planning. An important focus in this regard will be to expand the involvement of women

30

in natural resource management, especially in the Altiplano, where men often leave the
region for seasonal work elsewhere. The relative abundance of grass-roots organizations
specializing and working in natural resource conservation and sustainable production
technologies provides a sound foundation on which to build effective civil society and
private sector cooperation for planning and establishing local natural resource
management and conservation priorities. It should also serve as a useful base for the
establishment of privatized service delivery mechanisms and implementation of
technically sound investments in response to local demands. Regional MARN
Delegations are being established to help promote this local level involvement in
coordination with other agencies of the Integrated Environmental Management System as
well as with SEGEPLAN and the Commission for Decentralization and Modernization of
the State (COPRE).
60.
An additional priority under the Guate Verde pillar is to foster markets for
environmental services. To this end, the Government intends to: (i) develop the
framework for policies and markets for environmental services, through the elaboration
of a National Strategy for environmental services; (ii) undertake research and special
studies and training for local and national officials working in areas related to
development of environmental services policy, legal framework and pilot programs; (iii)
design and implement projects aimed at developing capacity, methodologies and
instruments for market-based incentives for the provision of environmental services. The
development of environmental services markets is seen as an essential element of a
longer-term strategy to achieve the sustainable use and conservation of natural resources.
A national level group will be formed by MARN to coordinate efforts and share
experiences on environmental services in Guatemala. The group will also coordinate
support to initiatives being undertaken under the Guate Crece/Compite pillar. For
instance, MARN has initiated efforts to focus on the environmental health of key tourism
and eco-tourism sites in partnership with local tourism businesses. Efforts are also being
made to promote environmental services businesses, particularly in rural areas, where
they may also become a source of new jobs. Finally, MARN will engage, in partnership
with the Competitiveness Program, in the promotion of ecological and eco-certified
products, and the integration of environmental concerns into the National Science,
Technology and Innovation Plan.
61.
A final emphasis of Guate Verde is the improvement of governmental capacity to
carry out more effective and efficient environmental impact assessments and
environmental impact mitigation plans to minimize the potential negative effects of
development projects in both the public and private sectors. In parallel, efforts will be
made to streamline the process of approving environmental impact assessments for
businesses.

IV. EVALUATION OF COUNTRY ASSISTANCE FY98-03
A.

IBRD PROGRAM

62.
The last full CAS for Guatemala outlined a three-year $310 million lending
program for FY99-01 plus a supporting set of non-lending services. The stated aim of the
CAS was helping to meet the targets of the 1996 Peace Accords, and the CAS Matrix was
titled: “Making Peace Stick: Working Together to End Exclusion”. A CAS Progress
Report, discussed by the Board in May 2002, was developed largely in response to the
financial crisis of 2001 and proposed new commitments of $302 million for FY02-03,
including a Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (FSAL) for $150 million and a small,
accompanying TA project. In addition, the CAS Progress Report continued to emphasize
support to economic growth, through work on tax administration, competitiveness,
financial management and judicial reform, in addition to a public expenditure review.
New lending operations were also included to support rural productivity growth,
including a rural roads project and a natural resources management project.
63.
For the period FY99-01, new commitments totaled $249.5 million in practice, 20
percent less than the $310 million originally forecast. Of the 12 lending operations
planned in the CAS, six were not approved or were cancelled before implementation due
to shifting priorities associated with a change of Government, shortly after the CAS was
discussed by the Board. These cancellations were offset by increased funding for the
social funds, basic education, competitiveness, land fund and land administration
projects. Actual lending over the CAS Progress Report period, FY02-03, totaled US$265
million, also below the proposed base-case scenario. The discrepancy mainly derived
from adapting the Bank’s lending to areas of assistance supported by other donors. As
expected, Bank lending was front-loaded: three projects totaling US$185 million were
approved in FY02, and two projects totaling about US$80 million were approved in
FY03.
64.
In addition to lending, the Bank’s Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA)
constituted an important plank of the Country Program.
Between FY99-04
disbursements on AAA accounted for $3.37 million, representing 17 percent of the total
expended for direct program costs. Among the highest-impact activities were the Poverty
Assessment (known as GUAPA) and the FSAP, which provided the underpinnings for
the FSAL. In addition, by the end of FY04, two other major reports were completed—
the Country Economic Memorandum and the Investment Climate Assessment—as well
as a number of sectoral policy notes for the social sectors (covering education, health and
social funds), rural infrastructure, land issues and tax administration, which aimed to
inform the new Berger Administration’s policy directions and serve as a basis for
dialogue concerning this new Country Assistance Strategy. A recent QAG review of
AAA activity in Guatemala found that it had a very positive impact.
65.
Country Program Performance Indicators. The CAS framework was
organized around four broad areas: increasing social cohesion and participatory decision
making, reducing poverty and social exclusion, improving economic management and
promoting faster growth, and modernizing the public sector to make it more efficient.
32

Table 6 below summarizes the development goals laid out in the 1998 CAS and in the
2002 CAS P and reports the progress achieved by Guatemala during the CAS period.
In many areas, Guatemala made significant advances during the CAS period. These are
summarized below.
•

In the field of social cohesion and participatory decision making, the
implementation of the judicial reform process, the establishment of the civilian
police system, the involvement of NGOs in health service provision under the
PEC program and the development of the CDURs are noteworthy advances.
However, the failure to tackle corruption in the tax system effectively—in spite of
the implementation of the SAT reform—is a disappointing outcome.

•

In the field of reducing poverty and social exclusion, the results were mixed.
The ambitious goal adopted in the CAS Progress Report for reduction of the
extreme poverty headcount rate from 16 percent in 2000 to 12 percent by 2005 is
unlikely to have been met, in light of the slow growth reported for 2001-04. Nor
are the results in rural access to productive opportunities particularly positive.
Although electricity coverage increased markedly, rural road maintenance
coverage remained very low. Land access advanced slowly and the Land Fund
program was plagued with difficulty.

Nor did access to rural credit improve significantly. Better results were reported
on access to basic services. The targets for increasing the share of education and
health spending in relation to GDP were met and there were positive trends in
coverage and in outcomes in both sectors. However, the goals related to
educational efficiency and quality were not met and there are serious issues
concerning the quality of services provided under the NGO-based health
expansion program (in part due to manipulation during the Portillo
administration). The rural water and sanitation coverage targets were missed, and

34

the goal of improving the efficiency and targeting of the social protection system
(especially the social funds) was only partially met. There remains a need to
tackle fragmentation of social fund programs and improve their cohesion with
sector policies and municipal development strategies.
•

In the field of improving economic management and promoting faster growth,
important advances were made in stabilizing and reforming the financial sector,
building on the findings of a 2000 FSAP. However, the decline in business
confidence during the Portillo administration, together with external shocks, led to
the GDP growth targets being badly missed. In addition, continuing corruption
problems in the tax administration, coupled with political resistance to new taxes
within the private sector, meant that the goal of increasing tax revenues was also
not achieved. By end-2003, tax revenues stood at 10.3 percent of GDP, well short
of the 12 percent target identified in the Peace Accords.

•

In the field of public sector modernization and efficiency, the most important
achievement was the implementation of the SIAF reform in public sector
budgeting and financial administration. The judicial reform program was
implemented successfully at the national level, though the development of
effective local access was slow. Land registry reform did not advance beyond the
pilot program in the Petén, because the necessary legislation was blocked in
Congress. Advances on the effectiveness of project implementation were mixed,
as reflected in the Bank’s own portfolio, where several important projects had
long overruns.

66.
Bank performance. The Bank’s performance mirrored that of the country during
the CAS period. Some of the activities supported under the program were very successful
and made decisive contributions to the advances shown in Table 6. Among the most
important successes were the contribution of the PRONADE project to increased
educational coverage, the development of the SIAF, and financial sector reform. In some
other areas where the country development goals were clearly not met, the Bank’s
interventions nevertheless laid important foundations for future advances. In cadastre and
land titling, the Bank-supported Petén model provides a basis for the implementation of
cadastre and titling reform in the rest of Guatemala. Similarly, the rural roads project
carried out with municipal associations in San Marcos provides a workable model for
establishing municipal maintenance programs for rural roads country-wide in the future.
The establishment of the SAT system for tax administration did not lead to the hoped-for
gains, due to the lack of political commitment under the Portillo administration, but the
Bank-supported system provides the legal, institutional and technical basis for a rapid
improvement in performance and transparency of the tax administration, once the
political will is there. In the field of social funds, although the long-standing issues
around rationalization of the different funds and coordination with sector strategies and
municipal development plans remained largely unresolved, the Bank-promoted dialogue
around these issues helped lay the foundations for the implementation of reforms under
the current administration.

67.
In other areas, as noted above, the CAS program had more difficulty achieving its
goals. This arose, in part, from the lack of governmental commitment during 2000-03 to
aspects of the reform agenda laid out in 1998. It was also due to disagreements in
Guatemalan society about how to go forward. For example, the Fontierras project was
affected by the incongruence of the model adopted by the Government; the rural
financing and natural resources components of the CAS program virtually evaporated;
the Competitiveness program stagnated for four years during the FRG administration; the
Box F: Main Recommendations from the CAS Completion Report

1. The new CAS should support stronger overall programmatic cohesion. To this end, a significant
part of the portfolio should be committed to programmatic lending, which is better suited to
addressing the policy and institutional issues than traditional investment projects. From a fiduciary
point of view, the advances with SIAF (including its Gautecompras component) provide a
reasonable basis for a move towards more programmatic lending. The upcoming CFAA and PER
should identify issues that still need to be resolved.

2. The Bank should consider ways to reduce the relatively high cost of project implementation by
ensuring timely completion and by reducing the program’s dependence on relatively expensive
Project Implementation Units. A shift towards fewer, larger operations and an increased role for
programmatic lending would help reduce the high transactions costs associated with a plethora of
small ring-fenced projects. This, in turn, would help reduce the related management costs and
enable increased alignment with the government’s own processes.

3. The present fiscal crisis provides an opportunity for the Bank to achieve high returns from
increasing budgetary support. The Government is committed to increasing spending on basic
programs but also wants to maintain the fiscal deficit at an acceptable level. By assigning resources
to budgetary support, the Bank will help to alleviate the fiscal crisis, and will provide bridging
finance for key programs, pending the crystallization of increased tax revenues in the future.

4. The country’s strategy for growth and poverty reduction should include the following key
elements: Reduction of poverty and race-related inequality: Guatemala must increase public
spending on social and productive to reduce poverty and racially-related inequality and to improve
its human capital situation. The tax take should rise from the present level of around 10% of GDP
towards the levels observed in neighboring countries. The Bank should continue to participate
strongly in policy dialogues in support of this goal. Growth: Guatemala urgently needs to recover
and surpass the 4% growth trend observed in the 1990s. Faster growth can be achieved through
improved infrastructure, a more competitive investment climate, and support to high-potential
sectors. The recently completed CEM suggests priority areas for action. Governance: continued
advance is needed in judicial reform, citizen security, and improvements in the quality of political
dialogues and processes. Fiscal accountability, transparency and anti corruption programs need to
be highlighted. And the efficiency, effectiveness and equity of spending programs must be shored
up to ensure improved services reach the poor.

5. A stronger policy dialogue is likely to yield positive returns in deepening consensus around these
points. The Bank should increase the presence of senior staff in the field and assign more resources
to analytical and advisory activities. However, it would be unrealistic to expect to achieve full
policy consensus quickly in all sectors. The Bank should develop dialogues in and orient the
lending program towards the high priority sectors where the development impacts are likely to be
significant and there is good potential for progress.

SAT tax administration project made reasonable technical headway but could do little to
offset the hostile political climate in 2000-03; and the Judicial Reform project made
uneven progress. In all these fields, there is a need to inject new impetus. In the last two
years of the FRG Government there was a general malaise linked to the governance and

36

transparency crisis. The only clear exception was the FSAL operation, managed by the
autonomous Central Bank with the support of the IBRD, IMF and IDB. A Completion
Report was carried out to review the Bank’s work over the previous CAS period and is
appended to this report at Annex D. Box F summarizes its main conclusions.
B.

OTHER BANK GROUP SUPPORT

68.
In addition to IBRD support, the World Bank Institute gave ongoing support to
the development of an anti-corruption strategy. The IFC funded operations for a total
value of $126 million, plus an additional $12 million from the participant companies. The
activities of these groups are detailed in the following paragraphs. MIGA provided
support to the competitiveness program and through investment guarantee operations.
69.
World Bank Institute (WBI). Over the period 1998-2004, approximately 1,850
representatives from Guatemalan government agencies, civil society organizations,
academia, and the private sector participated in WBI courses, conferences, GDLN
dialogues, and other learning programs. Programs delivered in Guatemala included
courses on utilities regulation, municipal development, trade policy, urban management,
water and sanitation, and social inclusion. Areas of particular focus were decentralization,
wherein WBI delivered a number of courses and seminars, as well as just-in-time policy
advice, and control of corruption wherein WBI provided training to municipal-level
officials and worked with the government and civil society to launch a detailed diagnostic
survey as input to a national action plan. In addition to these in-country, face-to-face
programs, Guatemala also benefited from a wide range of courses delivered through the
distance learning center at Rafael Landivar University.
70.
International Finance Corporation (IFC). In the last CAS period, IFC
continued to seek opportunities to increase support for the private sector in Guatemala.
The Corporation’s commitments in Guatemala during FY99 to FY04 totaled $126 million
(including $12 million for syndications), $98 million of which was signed in the period
after the CAS Progress Report. Five investments were committed since the Progress
Report in sectors including the financial market, power, and mining.
•

IFC’s support increased in the financial sector over the previous CAS period as
IFC committed and disbursed its first direct financing, a $10 million subordinated
convertible loan to a Guatemalan subsidiary of a leading Central American bank
(as part of a $40 million regional project) in FY03. The loan was provided for
strengthening the capital base and supporting growth. IFC also committed
another $10 million subordinated loan to a leading Guatemalan bank for similar
objectives. These investments aim to help these institutions prepare for meeting
the stricter requirements of financial sector legislation, complementing the Bank’s
assistance to financial sector reform.

•

Through two Central American regional projects, IFC also promoted broader
access to finance. These projects are: an equity investment in the first credit
bureau that would operate throughout Central America, establishing the first
Guatemalan private credit bureau; and another equity investment in a private
37

equity fund that would acquire minority interests in medium-sized Central
American enterprises that would provide shareholder rights and pursue a Central
American regional integration strategy. The establishment of private credit
bureaus is expected to facilitate the extension of credit to previously underserved
segments of the population, in particular small businesses, while the latter
investment would promote good corporate governance practices, the key to
attracting equity investors. In addition, with donor fund support, IFC is
completing two housing finance studies in Central America, one of which aims to
identify IFC’s possible intervention in Guatemala, Nicaragua and Honduras
through a gap analysis of housing needs.
•

In the power sector, IFC provided a $27 million loan (including $12 million
mobilized through a B loan) for the building of a hydroelectric power plant in
western Guatemala. In addition to financing, IFC also collaborated with the
Prototype Carbon Fund to help arrange the sale by the plant of displaced carbon
dioxide of approximately 167,000 tons equivalent per year that would otherwise
be generated through a thermal plant. This is the first project finance transaction
in Central America that would sell carbon credits and could set an example for
encouraging the transfer of cleaner technologies to the region that reduce
emissions at an effectively reduced cost.

•

IFC also supported mining, a relatively new sector of development in Guatemala,
with a $45 million loan to the first mining project in the country in over twenty
years. The sector presents a strong potential to benefit Guatemala if the
development is supported and implemented properly. In this context, IFC has
been assisting the project on various fronts including the environmental and social
aspects and surrounding communities development.
For instance, IFC’s
Corporate Citizenship Facility funded technical assistance initiative to provide
training to the indigenous communities around the mine in developing and
managing forest nurseries for reforestation, as well as helping to identify other
markets which these nurseries can supply.

71.
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Corporation (MIGA). MIGA has been
working with the World Bank lending operations to manage a component of the
country’s National Competitiveness Program. Under this component MIGA is providing
technical assistance to Invest in Guatemala (IIG), the national investment promotion
agency aimed at capturing higher value-added foreign direct investment (FDI) and
diversifying FDI flows into new sectors. Work on the project stalled during the previous
administration. Since the new administration has taken office progress has improved
significantly. The technical assistance involves training, capacity building for IIG and
partners, institutional strengthening, and guiding IIG through proactive investment
promotion campaigns in five sectors (light manufacturing, tourism, back office/services,
agribusiness and textiles) emphasizing job creation and export oriented investments.
72.
The Guatemalan Chamber of Commerce (GCC) and Invest in Guatemala (IIG)
were selected in a competitive process with other countries' investment intermediaries, as
joint recipients of technical assistance under MIGA's FDI Xchange Investor Information

38

Development Program, a capacity-building program designed to assist investment
intermediaries in developing countries and emerging economies to compile and mobilize
critical investment information. In the fall of 2003, MIGA evaluated the quality of
investor-oriented information available on the IIG website and completed a study to
identify and fill the gaps. In March 2004, work began to upgrade the quality and quantity
of information as well as the design and structure of the website. The updated website is
now operational. MIGA will continue work with IIG to create an agency brand and full
range of investor information systems. Currently, www.fdixchange.com and
www.ipanet.net are complimenting IIG information with just under 100 documents on
investment opportunities and the related legal and regulatory environment in Guatemala.
73.
MIGA has issued guarantees in Guatemala since FY97. MIGA currently has 5
outstanding contracts of guarantee, in Guatemala, for US$109.2 million gross exposure
equivalent to 2 percent of portfolio, and 20th largest host country overall. All of these
contracts are guaranteeing projects in the power sector, both in energy generation and
distribution. Marketing efforts were stepped up in FY01 with meetings and seminars in
Guatemala City at the time, with a view of supporting local firms expanding into
neighboring countries, as well as larger firms seeking to invest in Guatemala. Further
marketing efforts are foreseen during FY05. Foreign investors have expressed interest in
MIGA guarantees, particularly, for projects in the financial and infrastructure sectors.

C.

ROLE OF OTHER PARTNERS

74.
In 2004 there was a total of available funding commitments from external
development partners of about $1.6 billion1. Of this total, about 73 percent ($1.2 billion)
was in the form of loans and about 27 percent ($434 million) was in the form of grants.
The largest lender is the IDB with over $500

Norway, and Japan complete the list of the
five largest donors with available commitments ranging from over $60 million to about
$25 million. A summary of the distribution of development assistance as it relates to the
main pillars of the Vamos Guatemala! Plan is presented in Table 7. A more detailed
breakdown is available in Annex E. As shown in Table 7, Guate Solidaria has the largest
amount of donor financing available, followed by the “Fundamentals”, Guate
Crece/Compite and, lastly, Guate Verde. The relatively small allocation for the latter is
explained, in part, by the fact that Guate Verde comprises a single sector, whereas the

1

Details are provided in the Annex table “Donor Funding Commitments per Vamos Guatemala
Components”

39

other pillars each comprise a number of areas under a single theme. It is also due to some
problems of classification since many activities (e.g., forestry, water and sanitation)
pertain both to environment and other sectors.

that development assistance beyond that
already agreed under bilateral negotiations with individual agencies (including the Bank)
would be difficult to absorb. As an alternative, the Government has initiated a series of
more informal meetings (3-4 per year) between members of the Cabinet and international
agencies represented in Guatemala. The Government has also recently set up an External
Cooperation Cabinet, chaired by the Vice-President, which has the responsibility for
overseeing the strategic coordination and implementation of all international
development assistance. To enhance coordination on a sectoral level, a number of
Interagency Tables (Mesas Interagenciales)—led by Government or the donors
themselves—have been established to facilitate coordinated action by the various
agencies involved in a sector. Currently, these Mesas are operational in rural
development, trade, education, land issues, indigenous rights issues, and gender concerns.
Since many of these Mesas are at an early stage, however, it is very difficult to assess
their impact in terms of improved coordination of programs among the agencies
involved. One sector in which coordination seems to be progressing well is education,
where several of the largest donors are explicitly developing complementary programs
under the leadership of the Ministry of Education. The intention is to move towards a
SWAP-like approach, enabling close linkage of interventions, albeit not yet a comingling of funds. Common positions and emphases also seem to be developing in some
other areas including rural development and trade. Overall, however, donor coordination
and harmonization could still be improved substantially as a key element of the effort to
improve the impact of development assistance and lessen the burden on limited public
sector capacity to meet multiple reporting and monitoring requirements.

V. BANK-GUATEMALA PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY — FY05-08
A.

OVERVIEW AND OBJECTIVES

76.
Given the high degree of correspondence between the priorities articulated by the
Berger Administration and the recommendations of key Bank analytic work—including
the Poverty Assessment (2003), the CEM (2004), the ICA (2004) and preliminary
findings of the ongoing PER and CFAA/CPAR analyses—the dialogue between the
Government and the Bank in the design of this CAS has been very constructive.

40

Moreover, the Vamos Guatemala! Plan described in Section III provides a balanced
framework for moving forward the Bank’s core objectives of (i) reducing poverty and
inequality, and (ii) fostering sustainable and more inclusive growth. In this context, the
Bank Group’s assistance over the four-year period covered by this CAS (FY05-08)
proposes a strategic program of lending and non-lending services to support the main
pillars of Vamos Guatemala! Following a period of considerable tension over
development priorities during the closing years of the previous administration, the Bank
regards the current policy environment in Guatemala as a window of opportunity—albeit
not without important risks deriving largely from ongoing political and social tensions in
Guatemalan society—to move forward on a more inclusive, accelerated growth and
poverty reduction path, towards achievement of the country’s own Peace Accords targets.
77.
In selecting specific areas for Bank support within the broad Vamos Guatemala!
Framework, high priority was given to the findings of key recent strategic analytical
work including the core diagnostic studies mentioned above (paragraph 75) as well as
sector-specific analyses in rural growth, rural infrastructure, property rights, education
and PPI. The CAS Completion Report (Section IV and Annex D) was also an important
factor in determining the choice and type of interventions as its review of past successes
and failures formed part of the dialogue with Government on the design of this CAS.
78.
The areas selected for Bank support also reflect a consensus reached with the
government during the CAS consultations with respect to the key development results
that will be supported over the CAS period. These development objectives are articulated
in a results framework (Annex B1) which identifies the main expected outcomes of Bank
support for each pillar of the Vamos Guatemala! national strategy. The results
framework outlines key medium-term development objectives articulated by the
government, measurable results supported by the Bank that are likely to influence the
achievement of these national objectives, and specifies the Bank-supported activities
linked to each development objective and outcome. The results framework provides a
basis for monitoring outputs and outcomes over the course of the CAS period in the
context of the overall monitoring and evaluation strategy outlined in Section E below.
79.
Assistance to Guatemala during the CAS period will involve a concerted effort by
all parts of the Bank Group and include: (i) support for implementation of the existing
loan portfolio; (ii) new IBRD lending, including a program of Development Policy Loans
as well as investment operations in areas where the Bank has global expertise and
comparative advantage and which complements the activities of other key development
partners; (iii) analytical and advisory services, technical assistance including facilitation
of access by Guatemala to grants administered by the World Bank; and (iv) learning and
capacity development programs through the World Bank Institute and its Global Distance
Learning Network, which has designated Guatemala as one of four focus countries in
Latin America and the Caribbean. In addition, IFC and MIGA will continue to seek
opportunities for interventions in support of private sector development in Guatemala.
These will fully complement IBRD’s efforts to accelerate inclusive growth through
supporting government’s efforts (under Guatecrece/compite) to create a hospitable
climate for business investment.

41

B.

THE ONGOING PORTFOLIO

80.
Given that the portfolio of ongoing projects forms a major part of Bank assistance
to Guatemala over the CAS period, the Government and the Bank jointly undertook a
thorough review of the current portfolio, from the standpoint of its relevance to
Government’s strategic and programmatic priorities and planned outcomes to determine
the need for any restructuring or cancellations. The review also focused on means of
improving portfolio implementation, which has suffered in recent years due, in large
measure, to the hostile political climate of 2002-03 under the Portillo administration, but
also to the austere fiscal environment which prevailed in 2004, following the revenue
setbacks discussed in Section II. At present, the portfolio consists of 11 investment
projects and an FSAL, totaling about US$525 million, of which about US$255 million
remains undisbursed (Table 8).

81.
As Table 8 shows, all the projects are broadly aligned with the Vamos Guatemala!
pillars and, for the most part, are consistent with more specific programmatic emphases.
The Government is attaching highest priority to the projects in the public sector
management and governance areas, the education project, the rural roads projects, the
land administration project, the FSAL and its related TA operation and the
competitiveness project. However, given implementation delays in 2002-04 and the
limitations of budgetary space, it is requesting that several of these projects be extended
(Table 8) to enable completion of the original development objectives, with which it is
fully in accord. It may also request retrofitting of some projects in line with the new
financial parameter policies (Section G below). In two cases, the Government has
42

indicated that the projects would need to be reconsidered. These include: (i) the Land
Fund Project, originally designed as an APL, for which the Government has indicated it
would not wish to continue with a second phase, at least until policy clarity is reached on
changes to the land redistribution model it supports; and (ii) the Reconstruction and Local
Development Project, where duplicative institutional arrangements between three
competing social funds are negatively affecting the project’s potential impact. In this
latter case, the Government expects to request cancellation or restructuring of
institutional arrangements for the project by end 2005.
C.

PROPOSED NEW IBRD ASSISTANCE PROGRAM

82.
In terms of new lending during the FY05-08 period, the strategy adopted is to
move forward with a balanced program which allows for about half of lending to be
channeled through a series of programmatic Development Policy Loans focused on
growth, with the other half devoted to an investment program of interventions aimed at
directly reducing inequality and poverty and continuing to strengthen governance.
83.
The programmatic series of annual Development Policy Loans (DPLs) is expected
to focus on supporting the policy and institutional development aspects of Government’s
strategy for accelerating broad-based growth and improving governance as key
components of the effort to reduce poverty and improve social conditions. Actions
supported by the DPL series would be derived from the Government’s own priorities laid
out under the Fundamentals (paras 24-29) and GuateCrece/Compite (paras 42-55) pillars
of the Vamos Guatemala! strategy. The key areas to be supported by the program of
DPLs are summarized in Box G below and are fully consistent with the areas highlighted
in the 2004 CEM as central to the country’s economic development. The DPLs would
Box G: Key Areas to be Supported by the Program of DPLs
•

Accelerating Broad-based Growth – comprising measures to accelerate growth and enhance
competitiveness, including: (i) trade expansion (DR-CAFTA, regional integration), (ii)
investment climate improvements (administrative simplification, quality/standards systems,
investment promotion activities), (iii) increasing security of property rights (cadastral
surveying, national registry), (iv) PPI (concessions and partnerships in major infrastructure)
and (v) financial sector reforms (increasing stability and deepening the sector’s reach)

•

Improve Public Expenditures – comprising measures to: (i) increase tax revenues (via
administrative improvements and fiscal reforms), and (ii) improve budgeting and allocations
(multi-year results-based budgeting, enhanced social sector allocations)

•

Governance and Public Sector Modernization – including measures to improve transparency
and efficiency of the public sector (expanding SIAF and Guatecompras, promoting fiscal
transparency, strengthening the Controlaria, better regulatory framework for procurement)

provide quick-disbursing budget support that would be synchronized with the
government’s annual budget cycle and would allow the Government to reduce its external
financing costs by partially replacing higher cost bonds issued in the international capital
markets. Guatemala’s long track record of sound macroeconomic management, coupled

43

with the Berger administration’s commitment to promoting equitable growth,
strengthening public institutions, improving the country’s competitive position and
addressing long-standing social issues, makes the country a good candidate to receive
DPL assistance at this time. The choice of a programmatic series of single-tranche DPLs,
rather than a traditional multi-tranche operation, is particularly appropriate for Guatemala
as it allows for flexibility with respect to detailed design of each loan in the series—a
necessity in Guatemala’s difficult political climate—and allows opportunities for
reconsideration of Bank assistance should unmanageable risks materialize that derail the
Government’s program. Finally, it should be noted that the fiduciary environment for
proceeding with DPLs has been assessed, was found to be generally adequate (see para
99 below) and will be further strengthened through the DPLs themselves.
84.
The first DPL, which will be prepared for Board presentation towards the end of
FY05, will be based on critical prior actions in each of the three key areas highlighted
above. It will also lay out agreed triggers for future operations and monitorable
indicators of progress towards medium- and long-term goals related to broad-based and
equitable economic growth. The design of prior actions, triggers and indicators is
underpinned by a substantial body of analytical work carried out by the Bank in
partnership with the Guatemalan Government and civil society in the past few years.
Chief among these are the 2003 Guatemala Poverty Assessment (GUAPA), the
Guatemala Country Economic Memorandum (2004) the Investment Climate Assessment
(2004) and the Regional DR-CAFTA Study (FY05). The DPL design will also draw on
the Public Expenditure Review and joint Country Financial Accountability Assessment–
Country Procurement Assessment (CFAA-CPAR) which are currently well under way
and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of FY05. At this stage, it is
intended to retain some flexibility in the design of the DPL series, following the first DPL
for $100 million: if progress across sectors is uneven following the first DPL,
consideration would be given to the appropriate size of future DPLs; the policy emphasis
in future DPLs might shift in line with emerging opportunities to deepen the dialogue in
one or more of the key areas outlined in Box G.
85.
As described in the following sections, and summarized in Table 9, the series of
DPLs will be accompanied by selective investment lending focused mainly on reducing
poverty and inequality in key areas where the Bank has global expertise and which build
upon prior successful implementation of innovative operations in Guatemala, and which
complement activities of other external partners. In order to be responsive to the
government’s needs, and taking into account election cycle considerations, investment
lending will be clustered in FY06 and FY07.
86.
Support to Vamos Guatemala “Fundamentals”. As discussed in Section III of
this report, the main foundations of the Government’s Vamos Guatemala include (i)
maintenance of macro stability—including fiscal reforms to create further space for
social investment, (ii) security—both personal and legal, and (iii) improved governance
and public sector management, including at sub-national level. Three ongoing Bank
projects—the Tax Administration Project, the Judicial Reform Project and the Integrated
Financial Management Project—are already providing support in these areas. During the

44

period of this CAS, new support for the “Fundamentals” agenda will be provided through
two new lending vehicles: the DPL series, described earlier, and a Governance and
Public Sector Management project (US$60 million), planned for FY07. The latter project
would build on the accomplishments of the three ongoing projects and, inter alia, assist
Government to further strengthen transparency and anti-corruption initiatives, continue to
strengthen public financial management, support improvements in the civil service and
help establish e-government services. The Government has also requested that the Bank
provide support for Public Debt Management through the Treasury Department, which is
being considered for FY06. A Poverty and Social Impact Assessment (PSIA) on the
distributional implications of fiscal reforms is also planned for completion at the end of
FY05. Other inputs expected during the CAS period in the “Fundamentals” area will be
provided by WBI. These include an ongoing series of capacity-building workshops and
related programs aimed at increasing planning capacity and social accountability at the
municipal level and a national-level anti-corruption analysis and training activity,
building on a 2004 diagnostic survey of governance and corruption in Guatemala. In
addition, WBI is considering the development of a series of workshops on economic
management issues for members of Congress concerned with economic development and
macroeconomic management questions.
87.
Support for Guate Solidaria—Promoting Social Solidarity. The main
emphases of this component of Vamos Guatemala! pertain to human development
(education, health, nutrition and social protection) and rural development, including both
rural infrastructure services and support for both agriculture and off-farm productive
activities. At present, the Bank is supporting this area principally through: (i) the
Universalization of Primary Education Project which is focused on expansion of
coverage through the PRONADE model and on the introduction of basic quality
improvements and (ii) the Poverty and Local Development Project, a social fund project,
which is focused on building social and basic infrastructure in the Departments of San
Marcos and Huehuetenango via community-driven approaches.
88.
Over the CAS period, three new investment operations are planned in the
Solidaria area. Firstly, an Education Quality and Secondary Education Project of US$80
million is being prepared for delivery in FY06, which would aim at substantially
expanding access to secondary education in both rural and urban areas and improving
school quality and management processes (including parental involvement) at both
primary and secondary levels. As noted earlier, poor education quality and low levels of
enrollment in secondary were highlighted in the CEM as major factors affecting growth
and poverty reduction in Guatemala. The project would pay special attention to
education needs of indigenous communities and girls. Secondly, the Bank expects to
finance a Nutrition and Health Project (FY07) of about US$30 million to support the
expansion of the community-based nutrition program and support for the program from
the health system, especially with respect to maternal and child health. The project would

build on and complement ongoing activities being undertaken with IDB and other donor
support. It should be noted here that a planned Central America Regional HIV/AIDS
project (FY05) would also benefit Guatemala’s health sector, by helping to improve
diagnosis of, as well as stem the spread of, HIV. The third new investment operation
planned for this CAS period is the FY06 Local Development and Rural Growth project
(US$60 million), which is expected to take a multi-sectoral approach to increasing local
level empowerment, enhancing productive opportunities and ensuring rural access to key
infrastructure services. The project would be grounded in the findings of the recent Bank
report on Drivers of Rural Growth, the Policy Note on Rural Infrastructure, PPIAFGPOBA-supported reports on ICTs and telecommunications and ongoing work on
decentralization in the context of the PER. Each of the three planned investment
operations would be supported by capacity-building activities to be conducted by WBI.
A new Poverty Assessment would also be completed in FY07 following completion by
Government of a new ENCOVI (Living Standards) survey in the latter half of calendar
year 2005.
89.
Support for Guate Crece/Compite—Accelerating Sustainable Growth and
Competitiveness. Three operations in the ongoing portfolio of projects support this
pillar. In the financial sector, the Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (FSAL) and its
associated TA project are providing comprehensive support for continued strengthening
of Guatemala’s financial sector. The third ongoing project supporting this pillar of Vamos
Guatemala is the Competitiveness Project, which is scheduled to be implemented
throughout the CAS period. In addition, technical assistance under two PPIAF grants is
helping to address means of strengthening the legal, regulatory and institutional
frameworks to forge more effective public-private partnerships in the infrastructure and
telecommunications/ICT sectors. WBI has also been undertaking a series of training
activities and seminars in the area of Corporate Social Responsibility.
90.
New support over the CAS period will be provided principally through the series
of DPLs discussed above to help catalyze needed improvements in the regulatory and
institutional environment. As noted there, the DPL series will rely heavily on a number
of recent and forthcoming Bank reports including the CEM, the Investment Climate
Assessment as well as a Public Expenditure Review (FY05) and a CFAA/CPAR (FY05)
which will be completed early in the CAS period. In addition, an Energy Sector Study
will be carried out in FY06 to complement analysis undertaken in other key infrastructure
areas and help develop options to reduce Guatemala’s high energy costs. With respect to
Guate Crece’s property rights element, ongoing support includes Phase 1 of a Land
Administration APL, which has supported cadastral surveying and land registration in the
Department of Petén. Given the success of this first phase, the Bank expects to develop a
national program for support during this CAS period. Land Administration II is expected
to be about $80 million and is being prepared for Board presentation in FY06.
Consideration is also being given to developing an innovative guarantee operation to
increase private sector financing for infrastructure, including roads, low-income housing,
basic services and community upgrading. Development of this Infrastructure Guarantee
Operation (up to $182 million) will be preceded by detailed feasibility studies—partially

47

supported under a FIRST grant, before the operation is prepared for Board Presentation in
FY07. Finally, IFC activities, described below in paras 92-93 and Box H, will also be
focused on supporting the Guate Crece/Compite pillar of the Government’s strategy.
91.
Support for Guate Verde. Current support for Guate Verde is being provided
through regional GEF and other grants focused on biodiversity conservation and
management of protected areas. It is also expected that a new GEF grant for about $8
million will be provided in support of sustainably developing the Mirador archaeological
site as a major tourism destination, building on the successful experience with Copan in
neighboring Honduras. If awarded by the GEF Board, the grant will be made available in
FY06 and its design will be carefully coordinated with interventions by the IDB and other
external partners who are already active in the area. A Country Environmental Analysis
(FY06) will also be conducted during the CAS period in support of Guate Verde’s
emphasis on ensuring the environmental sustainability of new investments and on
reducing the vulnerability of the population to natural disasters. A Central America-wide
disaster management study (FY07) will also help in the latter area. Linked closely to the
CEA, a second GEF grant will be sought to help strengthen environmental management
at central and local levels, support environmental monitoring, improve land use planning
and management of protected areas and develop the market for eco-services. The grant is
expected to be linked to the Local and Rural Development project described under Guate
Solidaria. Consideration is also being given to further supporting the development of
Guatemala’s large carbon trading market potential by new CDM project development,
capacity building and replication of best practices. Climate change finance efforts, led by
the Bank, were initiated with a hydroelectric project (El Canada). Given the success of
this first carbon finance operation, it is expected that the pipeline will continue to develop
and expand from the electricity sector to include additional sectors. In particular, a recent
agreement with Spain to create a Carbon Fund, will enhance opportunities to do projects
in renewable energy, waste management and agro-forest activities in Guatemala. There is
also an existing commitment to develop a capacity-building program on CDM projects
for Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, beginning in the second quarter of 2005.
D.

IFC AND MIGA SUPPORT GOING FORWARD

92.
As in other countries in Central America, IFC support to Guatemala is provided
on both the country and regional levels. Complementing the Bank’s support to
Guatemala, IFC will seek opportunities to promote private sector development with
investments and technical assistance, by supporting Guate Crece/Compite in the areas
where IFC has competitive advantages. First, IFC will continue to seek country or
regional investment opportunities to help strengthen the financial sector, which may
include support for housing finance, building on a donor-funded market study undertaken
by IFC in Guatemala, Nicaragua and Honduras. Second, IFC will seek to support the
development of infrastructure in the country. IFC will consider investments in the sector
as opportunities arise. Taking advantage of potential synergies with IBRD, it will also
explore opportunities that would complement the Bank’s proposed guarantee operation in
infrastructure. Third, IFC will seek to support, via investments or technical assistance,
manufacturing (including MSMEs) and value-added export sectors, which are central to

48

Crece/Compite. Given the importance of capacity building of MSMEs and improving
overall investment climate, IFC will also provide technical assistance and advisory
support in these areas. Finally, IFC will continue to provide backing for extractive
industry development, including the oil and mining sectors. Specifically with respect to a
mining portfolio project, Marlin, (See Box H), IFC will remain supportive and act as a
facilitator of productive dialogue among the company, the government and the
surrounding communities, pursuing the best interest of all stakeholders.
93.
On the regional level, IFC is especially looking to: help improve physical
infrastructure; strengthen and broaden the financial sector, including access to term
financing by micro, small and medium enterprises; support competitive firms in
agriculture, industry and services; and promote investments from other LAC and
emerging market countries into Central America. The small economies in Central
America would benefit from economies of scale and deepening regional integration in
certain areas.
Box H: Environmentally and Socially Responsible Mining Sector
In June 2004, IFC provided a $45 million loan to Montana Exploradora de Guatemala S.A. to develop the
Marlin gold project in western Guatemala, which is the country's first major mining investment in over 20
years. In addition to providing financing, IFC has been helping Montana’s environmental and social
programs to ensure that the mine would contribute to the sustainable development of the region. IFC’s
Corporate Citizenship Facility has provided support for developing and managing nurseries for
reforestation around the Marlin mine, as well as for identifying other potential buyers of the nurseries’
products. Further assistance is expected to be provided to the communities through capacity building and
technical assistance activities to help create business and employment opportunities and to facilitate
community participation in independent environmental monitoring in the area around the Marlin mine, as is
IFC’s approach to other mining projects that it funds -- in line with the recommendations of the Extractive
Industries Review.
Local and international individuals and NGOs have expressed concerns regarding development of the
mining sector, especially as it relates to possible environmental and health impacts. There has been active
and intense public lobbying against Marlin and further development of the mining sector. The Government
and IFC are currently facilitating dialogue among different stakeholders and are focusing on improving
communications about the Marlin project and mining in general. The Government has recently requested
support from IBRD (through its ongoing Competitiveness Project) for further mining sector reform and
consensus building -- including a series of forums on mining, analysis of the mining legal and regulatory
framework, and development of options for the creation of a mining dispute prevention and resolution
system. The Government is also considering means of facilitating community participation in
environmental monitoring of mining projects.

94.
MIGA will be providing both guarantee and technical assistance support aimed at
FDI. As with other countries in the region, Guatemala’s proximity and (soon to be
amplified) preferential access to the United States makes it a candidate for many
investor’s site selection long lists. The fact that Guatemala has the largest labor force in
the region improves the chances of making the short list. Yet the country has clearly
failed to live up to its potential as an export platform for manufacturing and services.
While the changes to the investment environment must be accelerated, an effective
promotion program will achieve noticeable results in the short to medium term. This is
the premise for MIGA’s work with IIG. Over the coming CAS period, MIGA will be

49

working with the government to better integrate itself into the promotion process with the
local private sector to aid in the promotion campaigns and also open a dialogue with new
investors, and with IIG to identify needed changes in the investment environment and to
lead the effort to identify and promote Guatemala as a host for investors in its priority
sectors. The campaigns that IIG plans to undertake will involve identifying and targeting
potential investors with a range of products MIGA will assist IIG to develop. As a result
of the program, IIG hopes to generate approximately 5,000 to 6,000 direct jobs and
between 8,000 to 16,000 indirect jobs over the next four years.

E.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION OF THE PROGRAM

95.
The Government of Guatemala is committed to improving its monitoring and
evaluation systems as an input to strengthening transparency and accountability and is
seeking World Bank support for this initiative over the present CAS period. This resultsbased CAS, the first in the Central America region, seeks to support this government
initiative by outlining both a results framework (see draft framework in Annex B1) and a
strategy for strengthening Guatemala’s monitoring and evaluation capacity as a whole.
The aim of these efforts is to improve the results focus of the World Bank program and to
strengthen Guatemala’s own efforts to improve public sector management by providing
an empirical basis for informed decision-making both by policymakers and citizens. As
in many parts of the world, monitoring and evaluation efforts in Guatemala have focused
more on monitoring administrative procedures and spending than on outputs, outcomes
and evaluating the welfare impact of policies and programs. Guatemala is keenly aware
of the limitations of its present situation and is eager to improve its statistical systems,
poverty monitoring, program evaluation and results-based management capacity.
96.
Guatemala’s monitoring and evaluation capacity-building initiatives. The
Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Planning and the National Statistical Institute have
been working in conjunction with one another to spearhead improvements in
Guatemala’s monitoring and evaluation systems. Several initiatives are currently
underway that are being supported by a number of bilateral donors and multilateral
financial institutions. The Government’s strategy aims ultimately to link results to
budget allocations and is working to build off of its strong SIAF financial management
system to accomplish this objective. A central element of the present strategy is based on
working with three line ministries (health, education and communications/infrastructure)
that would serve as the lead implementers of a results-based focus using final outcomes
and related intermediate outputs to track public sector performance. These initiatives
would be complemented and supported by (i) a strengthened statistical system that would
ensure that basic data, ranging from census to labor market surveys, are collected on a
regular basis, (ii) the application of focused, strategic impact evaluations of priority
policies and programs, (iii) improved financial management systems both within the
Ministry of Finance (building on SIAF) as well as within local governments and line
ministries; and (iv) strengthening transparency and accountability through e-government
and civil society participation.

50

97.
World Bank monitoring and evaluation support. The results matrix in Annex
B1 represents a shared commitment between the World Bank and the Government to
setting and monitoring goals linked to both the Vamos Guatemala policy agenda and the
related objectives of the Bank’s assistance strategy. The goals outlined in the matrix will
be evaluated both in a mid-term Country Program Review which will assess progress in
meeting interim CAS/country targets allowing for mid-course adjustments to the overall
assistance strategy, as well as at the end of the CAS period through a CAS completion
report.
98.
Beyond this joint monitoring process, the Bank’s CAS program is closely aligned
with supporting the government’s overall monitoring and evaluation reform strategy.
With respect to strengthening the financial underpinnings of the system, the CPAR and
CFAA will complement the progress initiated by the SIAF to strengthen overall financial
management and transparency. On an operational level, the SIAF program will be
extended to a growing number of line ministries and municipalities and will, with the
support of the Governance and Public Sector Management Project and guidance from the
PER, support the establishment of performance-based indicators. These efforts will be
particularly relevant within the three line ministries identified by the government to
spearhead the monitoring and evaluation reforms, efforts supported by the new education,
health-nutrition and rural roads projects. The Poverty Assessment will build on a 2005
application of the ENCOVI household survey to update poverty profiles and living
standards, assess progress on many of the Millennium Development Goals, conduct
incidence analysis of pubic programs, and evaluate the impact of several priority
government initiatives. Finally, an IDF grant will be sought to strengthen the
government’s own strategic use of the improved monitoring and evaluation data and WBI
resources will be applied to provide training in monitoring and evaluation.
F.

FIDUCIARY ENVIRONMENT FOR THE CAS PROGRAM

99.
In general, Guatemala’s improving fiduciary environment provides an adequate
basis for the proposed Bank assistance. With the Bank’s support through three integrated
financial management loans, significant improvements in the performance of budget
management institutions have been made over the past decade. Moreover, the new
Administration has advocated firmly for increased transparency in Government
operations. Building upon the ongoing active policy dialogue in public financial and
procurement management, the Bank is conducting, jointly with the IDB, a Country
Fiduciary Assessment (CFAA/CPAR), with the objective of documenting achievements
to date and identifying remaining challenges. Without prejudice to the formal findings of
the CFAA/CPAR report, Box I below describes broadly the state of public financial
management systems in the country. The Bank will continue to support Government’s
plans through the ongoing Integrated Financial Management Technical Assistance Loan
and the planned Governance and Public Sector Management loan. At the same time,
policy dialogue around key recommendations from the CFAA/CPAR will be
strengthened through agreement on certain key actions and milestones in the context of
the proposed DPL program.

51

Box I: Public Financial Management in Guatemala
In general, the reform program initiated in 1996 has resulted in improved levels of efficiency in the
Government’s financial administration. Key to the program has been the operation of the Integrated
Financial Management System (SIAF), whose module for standardized budget formulation and execution is
operating in 52 central government entities (all ministries, 28 agencies, and 9 decentralized institutions).
The system’s recent technological upgrade to a three-tier internet architecture will put the Government in
better position to address the overall issue of the sustainability of system operation and maintenance, as
well as to deal with the challenge of effective implementation and use of the system in local governments
and other autonomous entities.
In connection with the SIAF roll-out, the personnel of the financial management units (UDAFs) have
received extensive training, and relevant regulations and procedures have been made available via the
internet and other means. The sustainability of these interventions will depend, however, on the
overarching pending reforms to the civil service system.
Budget management is regulated by the Constitution and the Organic Budget Law. In general, the
preparation, execution and reporting of the budget follow well-defined policies and procedures. Worth
mentioning is the functional treasury single account complemented by a modern system of electronic
deposits to providers, which has increased the efficiency and transparency of government payments.
Transactions processed through SIAF are recorded on real time and the four-monthly mandated reports on
budget execution presented to the Controller’s and the Congress are prepared promptly and are accessible
through the internet. The main challenges ahead comprise: (i) the development of a medium term budgeting
framework, functional public investment programming, and performance-based indicators for budget
planning and monitoring; (ii) the disclosure, consolidation, and analysis of budget and execution data from
decentralized entities (including extra-budgetary “own funds”) and local governments; (iii) strengthened
capacity for reporting and analysis – with a view of reaching gradual convergence with international
standards; and (iv) strengthening of internal control systems, particularly in view of “third-level” budget
execution within deconcentrated ministerial units.
On the government procurement front, the legislation contains comprehensive rules for the acquisition of
goods and works, but the procedures for contracting consulting services could be better defined. To fill
gaps, draft amendments to the procurement and contracting law are being prepared under the auspices of
the Presidential Commissioner for Public Sector Modernization, in coordination with the Commissioner for
Transparency. The recent successful roll-out of the Guatecompras system has been recognized as a
paramount step towards increased transparency in state procurement. The main challenges ahead comprise:
(i) the development of a comprehensive strategy for “e-procurement”; (ii) the strengthening of the policy
and normative role of the State Contracting Directorate; (iii) further capacity building in the institutional
procurement units of budget execution entities (particularly municipalities); and (iv) adoption of
implementation tools (e.g., standard bidding documents and a procurement M&E system).
The Controller of Accounts (CGC) is granted by the Constitution and its Organic Law the independent
external fiscal control of all public sector entities. Although the CGC prepares annual work programs, these
are not based on internal control risk analyses. This situation constraints the CGC’s ability to perform
thorough financial audits and develop the capacity to undertake operational audits. The other major
challenge is that despite its improvements in technical capacity, the CGC public credibility has been
affected in the past after allegations of politicized or corrupt practices.
Financial management in development assistance projects. The Ministry of Finance has recently
undertaken an effort to incorporate the externally-financed projects into the budget. While from a budget
management perspective this is sound practice, the tradeoff has been slower disbursements, as those
projects that could previously execute over the budget ceilings are no longer able to do so. In general,
Bank-financed projects maintain satisfactory financial management and procurement arrangements, with
main challenges ahead being to secure more stability of specialized staff and to enhance the project
management information systems. As part of the CFAA/CPAR ongoing work, opportunities for better use
of country institutional arrangements and systems are being identified (e.g., in Education).

52

G.

COUNTRY FINANCING PARAMETERS

100. Cost Sharing. Country financing parameters for Guatemala have been agreed
with the Government (see Annex F). The Government has shown strong commitment to,
and ownership of, its development program. Bank-financed projects are fully integrated
into the budget and are well aligned with the country’s priorities and plans, as discussed
earlier. The Government finances the lion’s share of its development spending. The
Bank’s lending program represents only a small share of the country’s overall
development spending. Bank disbursements for the past four years have been around
US$56 million annually—equivalent to about 0.3 percent of GDP. This amount
represents a relatively small portion of Guatemala’s overall development spending of
about 5 percent of GDP (of which multilateral and official creditors—including the
Bank—contribute about 20 percent). The quality of Guatemala’s budget process is good.
The Bank may finance up to 100 percent of the costs of individual operations. Specific
arrangements would be determined for individual projects, based on project context and
the project team’s judgment of borrower commitment and ownership. This would also
take into account information on the borrower’s use of own resources to fund its
development program for the sector concerned. 100 percent financing is expected to be
applied selectively to stay within the overall CAS lending envelope. It is expected that
the share of financing would be higher (approaching 100 percent) in the social sectors
and in the governance and public sector management areas and correspondingly lower in
areas associated with infrastructure investments.
101. Recurrent Costs Financing. Currently the Bank finances recurrent costs,
including the reasonable operational costs of project implementation such as rent and fuel
for vehicles; salaries, pedagogical materials/supplies and scholarships in the education
sector; partial financing for maintenance of rural roads; and some recurrent costs
associated with cadastral surveying. Given the nature of projects in the proposed lending
pipeline, recurrent costs financing is expected to stay broadly within the ranges of recent
years. As discussed earlier, the Government has adopted a prudent fiscal stance that is
being strengthened by the Vamos Guatemala plan which includes measures to increase
tax revenues, strengthen public financial management and maintain low debt ratios.
Consistent with this policy, Bank recurrent cost financing will remain subject to overall
medium-term fiscal and debt sustainability. It is expected that Bank financing of
recurrent costs would have no significant impact on either fiscal or debt sustainability.
According to the recent CFAA public investment expenditures (including those financed
by the Bank projects) are well integrated into the budget formulation and execution
cycles. Furthermore, Guatemala maintains a very good record of sustainability of Bankfinanced projects. Given the above factors, no specific country-level limit on Bankfinancing of recurrent costs is proposed. Increased flexibility for financing recurrent
expenditures would be used in well-justified cases and with careful consideration of risk
to sustainability.
102. Local Costs Financing. The public sector’s own resources and expected
domestic borrowing are not enough to cover the financial requirements for the country’s
development program. The Government’s financial program foresees a fiscal gap of

53

about 1.5-1.8% of GDP. The Government expects to fill about half this gap by external
borrowing (including from the Bank), as an alternative to borrowing from local private
sources which would raise interest rates, placing more pressure on public debt service
requirements. A majority proportion of Bank investment lending disbursements are for
local costs: these have been about 90% in the last 3 fiscal years (FY02-04). Bank
financing for the social sectors and community-oriented projects has grown in recent
years and includes predominantly locally-procured goods and services. Infrastructure
projects are also relying heavily on local contractors. Therefore, the financing of foreign
costs alone would not enable the Bank to assist in the financing of individual projects.
Given that the two requirements for Bank financing of local costs are met, the Bank may
finance local and foreign costs in any proportion required for individual projects.
103. Taxes and Duties. Guatemala has a fairly simple fiscal and tax structure. The
core of Guatemala’s tax system is made up of four main taxes plus a number of smaller
taxes2. The four main taxes include: a corporate income tax (rate 31%); a personal
income tax (rates ranging from 15-31% on a sliding scale); a Value Added Tax (rate
is12%); and a tax on petroleum and derivatives (fixed at approximately $0.60 per gallon
on gasoline and lower on other petroleum products). Guatemala’s trade regime for
imports is fairly open with one of the lowest tariff rates (averaging 7.2% in 2002) in the
LAC region. Guatemala’s tariff schedule is based on the Central American Tariffs
System, which has a maximum tariff of 15%. Bank-financed activities are taxed at the
same level as the country’s normal rates, which are judged to be reasonable and nondiscriminatory. Therefore, the Bank may finance all taxes and duties included in project
costs. At the project level, the Bank will consider whether taxes and duties constitute an
excessively high share of project expenditure.

VI. LENDING CASES AND RISKS

A.

LENDING SCENARIOS

104. The CAS program has been designed in close collaboration with the Government
of Guatemala to respond to development and financial needs identified by the Berger
Administration as best suited to support from the World Bank Group. It aims to
maximize the Bank’s responsiveness to the Government’s requests, while minimizing
the risks through: scaling fast disbursing lending to policy performance momentum
through the use of the DPL series of single-tranche loans; close monitoring of progress;
and, focusing investment operations in a few, selective areas to which Government has
demonstrated the strongest commitment, where the Bank is uniquely placed to share
global experience and where past implementation experience has been positive (as
identified through the CAS Completion Report).

54

105. The scale of Bank financial assistance would be determined by the Government’s
ability to consistently deliver a high level of performance across the Fundamentals and
three pillars of the Vamos Guatemala! Strategy. The base case (Table 10) would include
up to $300 million in DPL, $310 million in
Table 10: Base Case Lending Program
investment lending and a possible infrastructure
guarantee operation (up to $182 million). FY05

discussed further in Para 106. To move into the Local and Rural Development

performance on the specific measures indicated in DPL III

Table 11. Progress on Table 11 indicators and Nutrition and MCH
$ 30 m
measures and their relevance to broader policy Governance and Public Sector
$ 60 m
performance will be assessed in a mid-term CAS Infrastructure Guarantee ($182 m) $ 50 m
Progress Report. In addition, to ensure appropriate
Total for FY07 $240 m
scaling of fast-disbursing financial support to Total for Base Case
$660 m
policy performance on key fronts, the number and
timing of DPLs in both the base and high cases would be further determined by the
specific prior actions and triggers included in the DPL documents (which management
and the Board would review separately from the CAS). Halting or back-tracking on
reform, including the government's inability to achieve the indicative performance
measures for the low end of the base case, would result in a low case scenario. In this
case, the Bank would seek to limit its exposure by suspending new development policy
lending and guarantee operations and limiting its consideration of new lending to the five
investment operations totaling up to $310 million, which are all focused on directly
reducing poverty and inequality and/or on improving governance, based on the need for
those operations and their likelihood of impact.
106. As table 11 shows, there is a built-in range, from $460 million to $660 million,
within the base CAS lending program. Steady policy performance across the
Government program and continuing financial needs would be the basis for support in the
higher end of the base case range, up to $660 million over 4 years, including $300 million
in a series of three quick-disbursing DPLs. Policy performance would be monitored
based on progress towards a few strategically significant policy objectives shown in
Table 11, including fiscal performance, social sector advances and progress on trade,
financial sector reforms and the business climate (including PPI), as key drivers of
growth. Progress in these areas is a prerequisite for moving to the higher lending range
within the base case. Less rapid progress in policy reform, but continued commitment
would be the basis for support in the lower end or middle of the base case range, allowing
for lending of $460 million or $560 million respectively. At the low end of the base case
range, the program would be limited to a single fast-disbursing loan plus the investment
project program and a possible guarantee operation. A second DPL would be developed

55

based on achievement of satisfactory progress from the low end of the base towards the
indicative performance measures specified for the high end of the base case.

RISKS

107. As alluded to throughout this document, continued strong performance by the
Government is subject to three main risks during the CAS period: (i) political gridlock,
given a divided Congress, (ii) societal tensions related to the country’s post-conflict
status, and (iii) exogenous shocks, related either to natural disasters or a deteriorating
external environment. These are described below.
108. Political risk is inherent in a post-conflict situation such as Guatemala’s, where
there continue to be deep fissures within society and where the electorate is very
polarized. As noted in Para 6, although President Berger was elected by a sizeable
majority, and retains favorable ratings of well over 50 percent after a year in office, his
supporters lack a simple majority in Congress. This, in turn, creates obvious risks for the
timely passage and subsequent implementation of the Government’s legislative agenda.
Currently, consensus needs to be reached with opposition parties for all legislative
priorities, with important implications not only for the pace of reforms, but also the
ability to retain the technical and policy coherence of the agenda within a political
context of continuous trade-offs and compromises. Likely to be especially controversial
is the fiscal reform agenda which is strongly opposed by many sectors of society, but
remains central to the country’s medium- and long-term goals, including the drive to
reduce poverty and inequality, forge greater social and economic solidarity and achieve
higher growth rates in a sustainable manner.
109. Pressures from narrowly-focused interest groups, such as the ex-PACs, could also
affect the Government’s efforts to maintain sustainable fiscal deficits, particularly if
Congress and the Courts give in to the groups’ sometimes excessive and unjustified
demands (and, on occasion, threats of violence). Social tensions also arise in other
politically controversial areas including continued trade liberalization, promotion of
increased private participation in infrastructure, parental involvement in education and
issues surrounding property rights and land, all of which are crucial to accelerating
growth and are central to the Government’s agenda. As referred to in Box H, mining
development has also been a very polarizing theme and has given rise to large
demonstrations by indigenous groups and local and foreign NGOs against mining in
particular and the Government in general. Mining, in some sense, has become a
flashpoint for long-held grievances against the state and the private sector with respect to
past human rights abuses, discrimination and economic exploitation. This is also
apparent in a series of conflicts over land between peasant and land-owner groups, which
have, in a few cases, turned violent.
110. As noted earlier (Para 6), efforts now underway to consolidate support for the
executive’s development agenda in Congress, through the creation of a single GANA
party or a unified bloc with a common policy platform, could help progress on key
legislative initiatives. Efforts by the international community (including IDB, UNDP,
bilateral and WBI capacity-building initiatives) to modernize and professionalize
Congress should also help create better understanding of the technical issues surrounding
the legislative agenda. In addition, the Government’s public communication/consultation
57

initiative around social needs and sources of funding, as well as its continued anticorruption and public expenditure transparency campaign, could not only help build
consensus around goals and the development challenges in the social sectors but also
build support for a broader tax effort (Para 20). Moreover, the expansion of access to
justice and the establishment last year by the Government of a victim’s compensation
fund and other institutions foreseen in the Peace Accords (but not previously
implemented) could help mitigate some of the historical tensions surrounding inequality
and abuse. In this regard, the Government’s decision to support the establishment of an
Office of the UN High Commissioner of Human Rights, following the departure of
MINUGUA (UN-led agency for Peace Accords monitoring), could also help demonstrate
the commitment of the state to addressing abuse. Finally, efforts by the EU and a
number of bilateral European donors to promote a series of social dialogues between
Government and local and international NGOs could help enhance cooperation.
However, since many of the above efforts are relatively new, their impact on bridging
differences and forging a more unified polity remains to be tested in the coming years.
111. Besides political and social risks, Guatemala is also susceptible to external risks
deriving from natural phenomena and shocks related to international economic trends.
As with the other Central American countries, Guatemala is vulnerable to natural
disasters (hurricanes, and seismic or volcanic activity) which could necessitate
unanticipated spending for emergency assistance and reconstruction, thereby affecting
achievement of established development goals in the short term. In addition, there
remains the threat of shocks from the external economic environment (e.g., low
commodity prices, persistently high oil prices, global recession, political difficulties in
the U.S. for DR-CAFTA ratification, unfavorable conditions in financial markets) that
affect the economy negatively—keeping growth rates low and negatively affecting efforts
to raise tax revenues.
112. The Bank’s assistance program for Guatemala has been carefully calibrated to
take account of the risks inherent in the country’s difficult political and social context.
The choice of a programmatic series of single-tranche operations for the provision of
quick-disbursing support means that there will be several points at which the Bank’s
program could be reassessed if political gridlock or social tensions appear to be derailing
the development agenda, despite the Government efforts to address them. With this in
mind, the Government and the Bank have agreed to monitor the program on an annual
basis and to conduct a formal mid-term review of the CAS to assess progress and
determine the need for any revisions to the scale and timing of the Bank’s lending
program. With respect to natural disasters, the Government is beginning to develop a
monitoring and early warning system. The Bank will assist this effort via two planned
pieces of analytical work (Country Environmental Assessment and Regional Disaster
Management Study) and GEF-supported activities focused initially on the most
vulnerable municipalities (Para 91). In the event of a major natural disaster, however, the
Bank and the Government would need to rethink this partnership program in light of
changed priorities and define a new one for presentation to the Board.

ANNEX C:
CAS Consultations with Guatemalan Stakeholders
On January 24-28, 2005, formal consultations regarding the World Bank’s Country
Assistance Strategy for Guatemala were held in Guatemala City. These consultations
included representatives of civil society, the international donor community, think tanks,
and the private sector, as well as faculty from academic and research institutions. The
Bank team was lead by Ms. Jane Armitage (Country Director) and included staff and
managers from each of the key sectors. An earlier round of consultations was held in
October 2004 during a series of meetings with separate groups of stakeholders to solicit
views on priority areas for Bank involvement in Guatemala. These earlier meetings
produced a number of suggestions for the Bank’s strategic direction which were then
incorporated into the draft program of country assistance prepared during the first quarter
of 2005.
The methodology used during the latest and more formal round of consultations centered
on introductory remarks by the Country Director, a Power-Point presentation of proposed
areas of emphasis, and a listing of proposed lending and non-lending activities in support
of the Government’s program Vamos Guatemala. Following the presentation of these
items, the meetings were opened for general discussion. This approach facilitated
productive and frank discussions with the various stakeholders. As a result of these
consultations, a number of shifts in emphasis were made in the proposed program,
including: a greater emphasis on environment within the full range of Bank supported
activities; the broadening of a proposed Local and Rural Development Project to include
provision for basic infrastructure services such as water, sanitation, ICTs/telecoms and
electrification; and a clearer focus on development issues in indigenous communities
(human development, infrastructure needs, access to finance).
The following is a summary of views expressed by stakeholders during the last round of
consultations. These groups raised a number of general concerns with respect to fiscal
policy, access to justice and personal security, public sector management, education, rural
development, economic growth, and competitiveness, CAFTA, land property rights, and
the environment, as well as broader civil society participation for consideration by the
Government and Bank’s CAS team.
Strengthening fundamentals
Fiscal policy. Participants indicated that despite the Government successfully negotiating
a Fiscal Pact, there remain unresolved issues such as the gap between public revenue and
legitimate demands for spending to address critical socio-economic needs. In this context,
participants emphasized the need to increase public revenue through a more efficient tax
system with fewer loopholes.
Access to justice and personal security. Participants expressed some dissatisfaction
with the current status of universal access to a fair and efficient justice system, especially
for more vulnerable groups of society such as the indigenous population. Nonetheless,

there was general consensus among participants that the Bank has an important role to
play in terms of assisting the Government with the ongoing reforms in the security and
judicial systems.
Public sector management. Participants stressed the importance of increasing Bank
support for institution building to strengthen the effectiveness of key public institutions
(including decentralized ones) in leadership roles. In addition, participants highlighted
the importance of building broader consensus on reforms to promote the adoption of
public policies which will continue to be implemented despite changes in Government.
Participants also emphasized that the Bank could play a greater role in facilitating donor
coordination in order to contribute to a more effective public sector.
Reducing inequality and promoting social inclusion
Participants consider education as a priority area for social investment—it is a critical
element in stimulating economic growth, attracting foreign investment, and improving
income distribution. Improvements in the quality of the educational system and the
coverage of secondary education were also flagged as key issues in this sector.
Participants agreed that rural development is a central factor in reducing inequality in
Guatemala. Multiple calls were made to acknowledge that rural development requires a
multi-sectoral approach, while also recognizing that rural development can no longer be
equated to agricultural development. Key elements of a multi-sectoral strategy should
include improving access to basic services and markets, and increasing the assets of the
poor. Rural development plans should also strive to promote and empower Guatemalans’
entrepreneurial spirit through programs that support SMEs. Furthermore, participants
stated that much remains to be done to improve general access to land; they welcomed
the Bank’s interventions in this area and encouraged an expansion of the geographical
scope of the project.
Stimulating Growth and enhancing competitiveness
Various groups highlighted the importance of promoting faster economic growth and
competitiveness as a way to reduce poverty and achieve a more equitable distribution of
wealth. The issue of how to support micro, small, and medium enterprises (SMEs)
(especially in light of the of the impacts of CAFTA and other free trade agreements) and
how to enhance the country’s technology absorption and innovation capacity was of
interest to all participants. It was also recommended that both Government and the Bank
develop stronger mechanisms to ensure that the benefits of economic growth reach the
poor, particularly indigenous populations in rural areas.
Improving land property rights through the Bank-supported cadastre program was
hailed by participants as an important step both in reducing social tensions and promoting
economic growth. Some participants expressed concern about land disputes that could
arise from using more precise methods of measuring plots. In addition, it was stressed

that the Bank ensure that the cadastre program remain purely a technical initiative,
untainted by politics.

Mainstreaming Environmental Concerns
Participants stated the importance of Bank support for new environmentally sustainable
initiatives. Participants strongly stressed the need to support municipal governments in
the area of natural conservation as they are becoming increasingly responsible for
managing natural protected areas. Other areas in which the Bank’s intervention would be
welcomed include: erosion of Guatemala’s agricultural biodiversity, increased urban
pollution, and natural disaster management.
Other Concerns
Lastly, participants in the various groups highlighted their desire to make project design
and implementation procedures more inclusive and participatory. In their view, this
shift will facilitate the link between development processes and their beneficiaries. In
turn, such a culture would result in permanent and transparent mechanisms for
monitoring and ensuring accountability of projects and public policies.
- Specific Recommendations •
•
•
•
•
•
•

Efforts to close educational gaps should emphasize the quality of primary education, while
also considering expanding coverage for secondary education;
Develop mechanisms to ensure that the benefits of economic growth reach the poor,
particularly indigenous populations in rural areas;
Expand the cadastre program to the whole country;
Provide more examples to substantiate how trade reduces poverty and generates employment
Pay greater attention to providing specific support to municipalities for the management of
natural resources;
Support the creation of sustainable activities that create employment such as agricultural
biodiversity; and
Bank projects should include an institutional capacity building component to ensure
sustainability

Introduction
1.

A

This report appraises the World Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy for
Guatemala during 1998-2004. It follows the Guidance Framework for such reports
recently issued by the Bank. Section A concentrates on the Long Term Strategic
Goals for the country with which the CAS was aligned, looking at whether these were
well-chosen, adequately defined and to what extent the country met them. Section B
concentrates on CAS Outcomes. It reviews the programs supported by the Bank
Group assistance program and looks at their outcomes, commenting on what worked
well and what went badly. It concludes with a summary appraisal of the extent to
which the Bank’s assistance can be considered to have contributed to the Country’s
advance with Long Term Strategic Goals as documented in Section A. In Section C,
the report looks at Bank Performance, assessing the performance of the portfolio; and
appraising the quality and effectiveness of policy dialogue and aid coordination.
Section D provides a summary of conclusions and recommendations,
Long Term Strategic Goals

A.1 Was the choice of objectives and areas of intervention appropriate?
2.

The 1998 CAS is rooted in the 1996 Peace Accords. The stated aim of the CAS
was helping to meet the targets of the Accords, and the CAS Matrix was titled:
“Making Peace Stick: Working together to end Exclusion”. The program was
organized around four objectives: the promotion of social cohesion and participatory
decision making; the reduction of poverty and social exclusion; the improvement of
economic management to foster growth; and the modernization of the public sector.

3.

Key informants interviewed by the review team concurred that this was an
appropriate agenda for Guatemala in 1998. The country was in a post-conflict
situation where there was a premium on establishing a national agenda to which the
parties to the conflict could subscribe. However, the consensus around the Accords
was fragile. For example, the private sector remained wedded to a vision of a
minimalist state and resistant to any increase in the tax burden. And while the peasant
organizations demanded the redistribution of land, the private sector resisted this.

4.

In this context, the Bank promoted initiatives that were important for Guatemalan
development and poverty reduction and where its support would be likely to make a
difference. The objectives outlined in the CAS fitted well into the national agenda,
covering areas where the Bank could expect to “add value”, based on the country’s
needs; the Bank’s capabilities; and the activities of other donors.

A.2 Guatemala’s performance on long term strategic goals
5.

Political developments in Guatemala in 1998-2004 had important repercussions
on the Bank’s program. It was soon clear that the 1996 Peace Accords had papered
over many cracks and that different parts of Guatemalan society still had
diametrically opposed visions of how the country should advance, and the aura of

1

optimism surrounding the Accords began to dissipate. This was already evident in
1998, when a political crisis ensued from the failure of a referendum, which sought to
embed aspects of the Accords into the 1995 Constitution. The coming to power of the
Portillo administration in 1990 further underlined these divergences. Many elements
of the Arzu government’s strategy, which the Bank had supported – such as the
privatization of public services - were put on hold. The new administration adopted a
more aggressive stance towards business in tax collection, but taxation became
increasingly arbitrary, leading to accusations of “fiscal terrorism”.
6.

This polarization coincided with the worldwide recession of 2001-2. There was a
rapid deterioration in business confidence, and investment and growth rates fell
sharply. Against a background of growing accusations of corruption, the ruling party
resorted to populist strategies to maintain its support in rural areas (such as the
mobilization of ex-members of the Patrullas de Autodefensa Civil, PACs) and pulled
back from modernization strategies opposed by organized groups such as the teachers
unions. At the same time, private sector interests were successful in having a
presumptive income tax declared unconstitutional, which was a setback for the
strategy to increase tax revenues to finance social programs.

7.

These conflicts undermined the legitimacy of the executive and the legislature,
leading to a crisis of governance. This setting was not propitious for the
implementation of the CAS. An attempt was made in 2001 to develop a consensus
around a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, but the underlying polarization deepened.
Although the Bank was able to work effectively with the government on critical
issues – such as the financial sector crisis that ensued from the 2001 recession – in
many areas, CAS implementation slowed and Guatemala failed to meet many of the
benchmarks laid out in the Peace Accords and in the CAS. Nevertheless, Guatemala
made significant advances in many areas during the CAS period.

8.

Table 1 summarizes the Long Term Strategic Goals supported by the CAS and the
results that were obtained. In the field of social cohesion and participatory decision
making, the implementation of the judicial reform process, the establishment of the
civilian police system, the involvement of NGOs in health service provision under the
PEC program and the development of the CDURs are noteworthy advances.
However, the failure to tackle corruption in the tax system effectively – in spite of the
implementation of the SAT reform – is a disappointing outcome.

9.

In the field of reducing poverty and social exclusion, the results were mixed. The
ambitious goal adopted in the CAS Update for reduction of the extreme poverty
headcount rate from 16% in 2000 to 12% by 2005 is unlikely to have been met, in the
light of the slow growth reported for 2001-2004. Nor are the results in rural access to
productive opportunities particularly positive. Although electricity coverage increased
markedly, rural road maintenance coverage remained very low. Land access advanced
slowly and the Land Fund program was plagued with difficulty. Nor did access to
rural credit improve significantly.

10.

Better results were reported on access to basic services. The targets for increasing
the share of education and health spending in relation to GDP were met and there
were positive trends in coverage and in outcomes in both sectors. However, the goals

2

related to educational efficiency and quality were not met and there are serious issues
concerning the quality of services provided under the NGO-based health expansion
program. The rural water and sanitation coverage targets were missed, and the goal of
improving the efficiency and targeting of the social protection system (especially the
social funds) was only partially met. There remains a need to tackle fragmentation of
social fund programs and improve their cohesion with sector policies and municipal
development strategies.
11.

In the field of improving economic management and faster growth, important
advances were made with the reform of the financial sector. However, the decline in
business confidence during the Portillo administration, coupled with the world
recession, led to the GDP growth targets being badly missed, while continuing
problems with corruption in the tax administration coupled with political resistance to
taxation from the private sector meant that the goal of increasing tax revenues to 12%
of GDP was also badly missed. Tax revenues stood at 10.3% of GDP in 2003 and will
probably fall in 2004 following the abolition of the IEMA (a presumptive income tax)
by the Supreme Court.

12.

In the field of public sector modernization and efficiency, the most important
achievement was the implementation of the SIAF reform in public sector budgeting
and financial administration. The judicial reform program was implemented
successfully at national level, though the development of effective local access was
slow. Land registry reform did not advance beyond the pilot program in the Petén,
because the necessary legislation was blocked in Congress. Advances on the
effectiveness of project implementation were mixed, as reflected in the Bank’s own
portfolio, where several important projects had long overruns.

B

CAS Outcomes

B.1 Summary of the Bank’s proposed program and its planned outcomes
13.

The CAS proposed to support the decentralization and participatory
implementation goal through two social fund projects (FIS and FONAPAZ); a rural
and main roads project; and training on decentralization. Improved trust and respect
for basic rights would be pursued through a judicial reform project, a tax
administration project and an integrated financial management project. All World
Bank projects would incorporate social communications strategies and the Bank
would support the National Dialogue on reform issues, including corruption.

14.

Reduced poverty and social exclusion would be pursued through (a) improved
access to productive opportunities; (b) improved delivery of basic services and (c) a
more efficient and better targeted social safety net. The CAS analysis highlighted
several constraints to accessing productive opportunities: skewed land distribution
and unclear land tenure; poor land and resource management; the scarcity of capital
for the rural poor; and inadequate infrastructure in rural areas (roads, electricity and
telecommunications). To increase land access: the Bank would support: the Land
Fund and the reform of land administration in the Petén; judicial reform; and
marginal barrio upgrading in Guatemala City. Improved land resource management
would be supported by a GEF/IBRD national resource management project, a rural
financial services project; and GEF support to the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor;
to the Laguna del Tigre and the Central American Coral Reef; and through advice on
implementing the new forest law and on Joint Implementation under the Kyoto
protocols. Capital access for the rural poor would be promoted by a rural financial
markets project; the Land Fund project; and also by the two social fund projects. IFC
would support micro-lending and agribusiness development. Infrastructure
development would be supported by the Private Participation in Infrastructure project,
by the Rural and Main Roads Project; and by the Reconstruction and Local
Development project. IFC was to support the power sector and possibly the port
sector and MIGA would provide guarantees to private investment in infrastructure.

15.

The CAS also proposed to support improved delivery of basic services in
education, health and water and sanitation. The diagnosis highlighted the inequity of
the basic education system and the related outcomes of high illiteracy (45% overall
and 60% for indigenous people); and the inefficiency and low quality of the education
system, including the lack of qualified teachers and materials for dealing with multigrade education; the limited availability of bilingual education; and the lack of a
system to monitor academic achievement. In health, the CAS highlighted low life
expectancy (62 years, the lowest in Central America), high infant mortality (55/1000
live births) and the 50% malnourishment rate. These outcomes were the result of low
spending on health, inefficient management and resource misallocation towards nonprimary services. In water and sanitation the low access to potable water and the
resulting high incidence of water-borne disease were highlighted.

16.

To address these issues, the Bank would support improved coverage and
community involvement through the basic education projects; and the social fund
projects were expected to build school and health infrastructure. The financial

5

management project would strengthen the administration of resources in education
and health. In water and sanitation improved access would be supported through the
Guatemala City Low Income Barrios project and by the social funds.
17.

In the field of social safety nets, the CAS proposed to develop a more coherent
overall strategy; to improve the targeting and effectiveness of social funds,
rationalizing interventions, to increase support for sustainable productive
opportunities, and to strengthen coordination with line ministries.

18.

The strategy to improve economic management, stability and growth included
fostering private investment and competitiveness; maintaining a stable
macroeconomic environment; reducing violence, improving infrastructure, improving
access to investment finance and reducing regulatory impediments to investment. It
was hoped this would raise growth to the 5% to 6% range. Bank support was to
include loans for competitiveness enhancement, private participation in infrastructure
and judicial reform. The IFC and MIGA would provide support this effort.

19.

Increased tax revenues would be supported through the creation of a new tax
administration system (called SAT) and total tax revenues were programmed to rise
to 12% by 2002, in line with the Peace Accords target. Land tax revenues were to be
raised. A tax administration project and macroeconomic policy dialogue would
support this goal. Rural financial markets and competitiveness projects would support
a strengthened financial sector.

20.

In the field of public sector modernization, the CAS sought to improve financial
administration, investment planning and project management, to pass a new civil
service law, restructure key ministries, improve the administration of donor support
and strengthen the judicial system. Relevant projects were to include: an integrated
financial management program (known as SIAF); the judicial reform project; the
creation of a single coordinating agency for processing approvals; and improved
training and coordination for project implementation units (PIUs).

21.

The CAS Update approved in May 2002 was based on the Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper, developed in 2001. The program for FY 02-03 included actions to
reduce poverty, promote growth and to strengthen the banking system. Poverty
reduction was to be supported by the two social fund projects, a new natural resources
management project and a poverty assessment. To support economic growth the Bank
would continue to work on tax administration, competitiveness, financial
management and judicial reform. Financial sector reform would be supported by a
T.A. loan and an adjustment loan. A public expenditure review was also planned.
New lending operations to support rural productivity growth included a rural roads
project and a natural resources project. The Update also incorporated a $150 million
financial sector adjustment operation plus a $5 million supporting T.A. loan.

B.2 Design and implementation of Bank group activities
22.

This section reviews the design, implementation and impact of the Bank’s main
interventions during the CAS period. Since many projects supported more than one of
the four CAS Goals, to avoid repetitiveness, the discussion is grouped thematically
under two broad headings – anti poverty investments; and public sector
modernization, transparency and governance. The section ends with a summary
appraisal of how much the Bank group’s program contributed to the country’s
achievements on the Strategic Goals discussed in Section A.

B.2.1 Anti poverty investments
23.

Social Funds. The social fund projects are highlighted in the CAS as
participatory, bottom up development initiatives which form part of the Bank’s
support to decentralization, and as the key component of the Bank’s support to
improved social protection. The FONAPAZ project is also part of the concentration
of the Bank’s program in the indigenous area of San Marcos.

7

24.

FIS II aimed to strengthen rural infrastructure while promoting community
participation. The ICR found an acceptable impact on infrastructure coverage (often
in coordination with other bank-supported programs such as PRONADE) and
improved targeting outcomes, but community participation outcomes were
disappointing. The FONAPAZ project aimed focused on areas that had been
abandoned during the conflict years. A field visit in San Marcos undertaken for this
report indicated a good match between the interventions and local priorities and high
community ownership, and confirmed that the beneficiary communities were
generally poor. The institutional decentralization to the San Marcos area seems to
have been part of this success. However, tensions between the FONAPAZ at the
national level and the PDL in San Marcos were considerable. Other problems
included a shortage of counterpart funds and limited community-level capacity for the
formulation and implementation of projects. The Bank should consider in future how
to provide stronger support for community implementation.

25.

Since 1991, 15 different social funds have been established in Guatemala, and
their funding is only 15% less than transfers to municipal governments. The three
main funds (FSDC, FIS y FONAPAZ) channel 70% of these resources. The CAS
pointed to the need to rationalize the social funds and improve coordination with line
ministries; this was also recommended in an OED review in 2003, but limited
headway has been made. The funds have independent planning processes and are not
coordinated with the sector agencies or even necessarily with the municipal
authorities or Consejos de Desarrollo in the communities where they intervene.

26.

There is a case for multiple funds in order to involve diverse interest groups, as
part of a strategy to improve governance, but it is important to avoid overlaps and to
ensure that the use of locally controlled resources is congruent with national sector
priorities. It is also important to develop a coherent overall policy for decentralization
and local development finance in Guatemala. A Social Sector Strategy Note, prepared
by the Bank in 2004, highlighted, once more, the need to rationalize interventions,
strengthen coordination with sector ministries, improve targeting and transparency
and develop contra-cyclical interventions to improve social protection outcomes by
providing temporary assistance to uninsured populations facing crises and economic
shocks. These issues should be given priority attention in the new CAS.

27.

Basic Education. As noted above, the Peace Accords goals for basic education
were met, and the Bank played an important part in this outcome. Education spending
rose from 1.6% of GDP in 1995 to 2.5% in 2000 and 2.8% in 2001, against a goal of
2.5% for 2000. Net coverage in primary education rose from 70% in 1996 to almost
90% in 2001; and for preschool it rose from 20% to 45%. The net coverage of
secondary education also improved, but remained very low, having risen from 18% in
1996 to 28% in 2001 for the third cycle and from 11% to 16% for the fourth cycle.

28.

The Bank’s Basic Education Reform Project (1997-2003) invested $33 million,
and the Universalization of Basic Education (UBE) project, approved in 2001 for
$62.2 million, had disbursed $12mn to the end of FY04. The Bank funds teachers’
pay in new PRONADE sections (which is taken over by the GoG in subsequent
years), supervisory activities and educational materials. The Bank has also supported
standardized testing in third and sixth grades. The new project is developing bilingual
8

textbooks and didactic materials for multi-grade schools and improving teacher
training, with 40% of the budget slated for these activities.
29.

Without doubt, the Bank’s support to the PRONADE has made an important
contribution to the increase in basic education coverage in Guatemala over the last
decade. The “COEDUCAs” - parent-managed schools established by PRONADE –
now provide for over 350,000 students. By 2001, PRONADE provided 13% of all
primary education places in Guatemala (up from 2% in 1996); and 12% of preschool
places (up from 3.6%). An evaluation of PRONADE by USAID showed higher
parental satisfaction and better teachers’ attendance compared with other schools (on
average 165 of the programmed 180 days, against 135). The Bank’s support in
bilingual education has also made an important contribution. In Guatemala, over a
third of the population does not use Spanish as their mother tongue and the
indigenous primary enrollment rate (75%) is below that for ladinos (84%).

30.

Notwithstanding its clear achievements, PRONADE remains controversial,
criticized by the unions for replacing state provision and for reducing teacher pay, and
the Portillo administration halted its expansion. Between 2000 and 2003, spending on
PRONADE fell 8% a year in real terms, its share of primary and preschool spending
fell from 17% to 13%, and enrollment in PRONADE stopped growing. However,
PRONADE began to expand again in 2003 and the new government is strongly
committed to the program. There is also a staff retention problem in PRONADE
schools. Since the teachers’ pay is lower than for official posts, most PRONADE staff
are entry-level teachers who are looking for an opportunity to transfer to an official
post; working for PRONADE has become analogous to a social service requirement
for entering the system. This can only work while the program represents a small
proportion of the total. As Guatemala advances towards the goal of institutionalizing
community involvement across the system, this issue will need to be addressed.

31.

The challenge for the future is to continue expanding primary education to
achieve the Millennium Development Goal of universal coverage, while improving
efficiency and quality in both the traditional and PRONADE models. The efficiency
benchmarks targeted in the CAS have not yet materialized. The huge gap between the
gross and net enrollment rate for grades 1 to 3 (125% and 72%, respectively) reported
in the 2001 Living Standards Measurement Survey underlines the size of the task.
Improved pedagogical supervision and the introduction of universal standardized
testing will be important in this regard. The Bank should also support increased
secondary coverage. Presently, only 25% of children of secondary age are enrolled
(46% in urban and 12% in rural areas). These ratios are inferior to the rest of Central
America and threaten to leave Guatemala uncompetitive on labor quality. There is
strong support for this agenda from the incoming Government and from other donors.
The Bank has recently strengthened coordination with other donors following the
relocation of the task manager for the education project to the Country Office.

32.

Land Access. The Bank funded the Land Fund and the Land Administration
projects in support of improved land access; the latter is discussed under public sector
modernization. The Land Fund (Fontierras) purchases land and reassigns it on a loan
basis to new owners, who are given additional loans for working capital and technical
assistance. The beneficiaries are collectives with 100 or more families; between 1.5
9

and 3.5 hectares is assigned per family. The loan is at a subsidized interest rate for up
to 12 years with a four-year interest free grace period. The Bank finances the
technical assistance component of this program.
33.

The availability of public funding on a large scale has arguably led to rent-seeking
behavior on all sides, including the pursuit of loans at highly subsidized interest rates,
the paying of inflated prices for land, and loan defaults. There are arrears of 35% on
the trust fund that financed the pilot phase, which benefited 4,000 families up to
1999. When the post-pilot phase ends its grace period, due shortly, it is feared that
many more will default. Since the beneficiaries do not have to pay up-front for the
land, they tend to agree to prices that overvalue the land. In the context of the coffee
crisis, the Fund has been criticized for favoring the owners (or their bankers) by
paying over the odds for bankrupt farms. The cost-per-beneficiary of the interventions
is high and the compulsory requirement of that the beneficiaries must be a collective
is likely to cause sub-optimal outcomes. The CAS outlined a land tax strategy, which
aimed to complement the land fund by providing an incentive to sell surplus land to
avoid paying tax on it, but this has not prospered. There remains a deep-seated
hostility to market-based approaches among peasant organizations.

34.

In this setting, the Bank’s Land Fund project has encountered many difficulties,
leading to slow disbursement. Nevertheless, there is a case for continued Bank
involvement in this area, given the national importance of the land issue and the
undisputable linkages from skewed land distribution to inequality. Correcting these
distortions will take many years. The Bank should press for more flexible approaches,
including support to individual (as well as collective) beneficiaries; and financing for
smaller-scale initiatives, with a lower cost-per-beneficiary, and for subsidies to be
transparent and up-front. The PACTA model being developed in Honduras with Bank
support may have good lessons for Guatemala. There should be a premium on
supporting the production of cash-crops linked to viable markets. The Bank should
also support a land tax to stimulate the sale of under-exploited land.

35.

Rural finance and natural resources. The CAS outlined projects for rural
financial markets (which was cancelled), and in natural resources management, where
an integrated project was developed for the Western Altiplano, known as MIRNA,
targeted on the remaining forest cover and upper watersheds and the poor, indigenous
communities that live there. The project cost was US$40.8 million, including a GEF
grant of US$8 million. Project preparation suffered major delays due to tepid support
from the Portillo administration. It finally had to be cancelled in late 2004 due to it
not being approved by the Guatemalan Congress. So the only natural resources
projects implemented under the CAS were two small GEF-funded TA initiatives.

36.

The CAS proposed a policy dialogue on the implementation of the 1996 forest
law. This law established the Instituto Nacional de Bosques (INAB), which is
regarded as a technically competent, professional agency generally free from overt
political interference. During the FRG administration, one of the main issues was the
government’s ill-advised and poorly targeted forestry incentive system, with
excessive payments for reforestation that can only be obtained by virtue of holding a
title, excluding most communal and indigenous forest owners. The authorities have
now recognized the need to change this; the amounts paid should also be reviewed.
10

37.

The new CAS should support sustainable, productive use of natural resources
through technical assistance and finance for productive infrastructure and crop
diversifications, and tourism development based on properly managed protected
areas. Policy dialogue should focus on environmental management and incentives
(including environmental service markets and targeting mechanisms). The Bank
should continue to press for a reform of the reforestation incentive scheme, for
strengthening national environmental regulation centered on MARN, and for
mainstreaming environmental considerations into all publicly financed programs.

38.

Roads projects. Market access is a critical factor for poverty reduction in
Guatemala, and the Bank funded two roads projects in the framework of this CAS.
The first upgraded part of the central highway to the west of Guatemala City – and
funded a rural component in San Marcos. The second project (approved under the
2002 Update) is for rural roads. The Bank played an important role coordinating
donor efforts in the road sector, where the IDB, CABEI, and Japan are all active.

39.

The Arzu administration established a maintenance program, which aimed to get
95% of the primary network into good condition by 2005. This was supported by the
Road Fund (the Fondo de Coservación Vial, COVIAL), an initiative to earmark funds
for road maintenance based on a fuel tax of one quetzal per gallon, which was
promoted by the Bank, and generates US$75 million a year. By 2000, 72% of the
network was in good condition, but in recent years, the Finance Ministry has not
transferred the full earmarked amount to the COVIAL trust fund, and spending has
fallen. By 2004 only 45% of the network was rated good.

40.

Most of the Rural and Main Roads loan ($57 million of the $67 million total) was
used for upgrading sections of the primary network and paving a secondary trunk
road in San Marcos. It has experienced serious delays, partly due to contractual
disputes and partly due to problems with counterpart funding. The remainder was
used for a rural access roads component channeled through INFOM in coordination
with the San Marcos inter-municipal association (mancomunidad), ADIMAN, which
has had a positive impact and has established a model for sustainability which
involves municipal governments in project implementation and establishes an
ongoing municipal commitment for maintenance activities.

41.

For the future, the key issues in the roads sector are: improving implementation
rates by assuring sufficient counterpart funding is available and avoiding contractual
disputes; ensuring adequate maintenance of the official network through the Road
Fund; and institutionalizing effective maintenance for rural roads. Given the
importance of rural roads for poverty reduction, the Bank should intensify its efforts
in this sub-sector. The role of INFOM should be gradually reduced, with a growing
role for the municipal associations as they acquire the capacity to assume it.

B.2.2 Public sector modernization, transparency and governance
42.

Decentralization and municipal strengthening. Municipal development and
decentralization were important priorities of the Peace Accords and were highlighted
in the CAS under the heading of improving social cohesion and participatory
decision-making. Related lending activities included the Rural Roads project which

11

worked through INFOM and the local mayors association in San Marcos (ADIMAN);
the Land Administration project which supported the strengthening of municipal
finances in the Petén; and MIRNA – pending implementation – which has a
municipal and local development component.
43.

Guatemala has made important advances in decentralization and municipal
development during the last decade, and in 2003 a new decentralization law was
passed. Municipalities depend on transfers from central government or development
assistance (often channeled through INFOM) for their capital budgets and to cover
part of their basic operating expenditures. The constitution mandates that 10% of all
fiscal income be transferred to municipalities. However, coordination between the
central government and municipalities is weak, and little has been done to build local
capacity. Municipal debt may become a fiscal problem, so the strengthening of
municipal tax bases is an important issue.

44.

A 1995 law created the Consejos de Desarrollo Urbano y Rural, CDUR to inject
a participatory approach to policy making at all levels. The CDURs have national,
departmental, municipal and local fora. The law also mandates a transfer of 2% of
sales tax income to the CDURs. This has led to ambiguity about their role, positioning them as an alternative structure for the administration of resources. The Portillo
administration used the CDURs to validate the Poverty Reduction Strategy in 2001.

45.

Public sector financial administration. Improving the quality of public sector
financial management was an important goal of the CAS. The Bank has supported an
integrated financial management system in the public sector, called SIAF (Sistema
Integrado de Administración Financiera), which started in 1996, and has been used
as a model in other countries in the region. SIAF’s module for standardized budget
formulation and execution is now running in 52 central government entities (all
ministries, 28 agencies, and 9 decentralized institutions) and the recent upgrade to a
three-tier Internet architecture will reduce its costs. Personnel have been trained, and
regulations and procedures have been posted on the Internet. In the next phase SIAF
will be developed (in reduced format) for use at municipal level. SIAF will provide a
good basis for initiatives by the Berger administration, such as civil service reform, egovernment and decentralization. The Bank is planning a Country Financial
Accountability Appraisal (CFAA) for FY 05, which will make proposals for further
strengthening of the system.

46.

SIAF has contributed to increased transparency and the reduction of opportunities
for corruption. Quarterly reports of budgetary execution are published on the Finance
Ministry’s website and the Contraloría General de Cuentas (CGC), the public office
for external audit of government agencies, has direct access to the system, on line in
real time. The Bank project works with the Contraloría to strengthen its audit
systems. Pending actions include: amending the law on contracting of consulting
services; creating specialized procurement units in line ministries and decentralized
entities; establishing a career track for procurement officials; evaluating the role of
UNDP as procurement agency for Bank projects; and amplifying the use of eprocurement through the Guatecompras website.

12

47.

Tax administration. The CAS highlighted the goal of increasing tax revenues in
Guatemala from 7.6% to 12% of GDP between 1995 and 2000, as laid out in the
Peace Accords. The goal was not met: tax revenues peaked at 10.6% of GDP in 2002,
and in 2003 they fell back to 10.3%. The Bank’s Tax Administration Project
supported the new Sistema de Administración Tributaria (SAT) created in 1998. The
project is still underway, having suffered major delays. At present, there is an undisbursed balance of $16.1 million of the $28 million loan and the new government
has requested a further extension for the loan.

48.

Although considerable technical headway was made with the SAT systems, the
political setting was not propitious. To achieve consensus on the law, the proposal for
a permanent Superintendency, which could not be changed by the government, was
abandoned. The Portillo administration changed the Superintendent four times and its
final year was marked by growing corruption in the tax administration.

49.

The obstacles to strengthening tax administration in Guatemala are manifold. In
the past, there have been instances of taxes being regarded as a means of rewarding
political supporters and pressuring opponents. This was perceived to be the case
under the Portillo administration, which led to accusations of “fiscal terrorism”
against businesses that were politically hostile to the government. Tax evasion is
rationalized by a private sector vision of the government as irredeemably corrupt and
inefficient. The private sector has fought to reduce the tax burden. The 2003 Supreme
Court ruling that a presumptive income tax, the Impuesto a Empresas Mercantiles y
Agricolas, (IEMA) is un-constitutional is expected to cause a fall of revenue of 2% of
GDP in 2004.

50.

The Bank has also supported the increase in fiscal revenues through the
promotion of a Fiscal Pact, in an effort to legitimize the collection of more taxes
through greater transparency and the linking of the income to necessary expenditures.
A central theme of this effort has been the need to eliminate unjustifiable exemptions
and – in 2004 – to reinstate the IEMA.

51.

The reform of the tax administration remains a key issue for Guatemala’s future
development. To fund the expansion of coverage and quality in basic services,
Guatemala will need a considerable increase in taxes. This, in turn, will require a
transparent and professional tax authority coupled with a sea-change in attitudes on
the legitimacy of taxation and public expenditure. The fact that the incoming Berger
administration has nominated as SAT Superintendent a well regarded ex-president of
the Bank of Guatemala augers well. The Bank should continue to support SAT and
the Fiscal Pact, working closely with the IMF to take advantage of the moment.

52.

Judicial reform. This is an area of the Peace Accords where Guatemala has made
significant advances. The goal for raising expenditure on the judiciary from 0.2% of
GDP in 1995 to 0.3% in 2000 was surpassed; spending reached 0.5% in 2002. In
1990, only 1/3 of municipalities had court offices. There was no separate Public
Ministry. There were around 4,000 police, headed by a military colonel. There was no
public defense system, and the judicial process was inquisitive, under the charge of a
single judge in the first instance. Some 30% of prisoners were on remand without
sentence. In 2004, there are Justices of the Peace in all the country’s 323 municipal-

13

ities. A National Civil Police force has been established with 20,000 members. The
trail system has been changed from inquisitive to accusatory, with the separation of
functions between the judge and the prosecution under the Public Ministry. A public
defense system has been established. By 2002 it was covering 10% of criminal cases.
53.

The new system commands a relatively high level of credibility. Judges and
public defenders are respected, and there has been a large increase in the arrest rate,
due to the new civilian police intervening much more actively in criminal events.
However, sentencing can take up to 3 years from the original accusation and as a
result, the increased arrest rate has led to an increase in the % of prisoners without
sentence, to around 50%. Another outstanding issue is the independence of the Public
Ministry and the Attorney General (Fiscal General).

54.

The Bank’s Judicial Reform project is supported by an IBRD loan of $33 million
plus $17 million in co-financing from Sweden, USAID and the IADB. The project
aims to improve the administration of justice, strengthen human resource
management and the judicial career; promote an ethics code and an anti-corruption
commission; increase access to justice through alternative dispute resolution
procedures and the construction of court complexes in Huehuetenango, Quetzaltenago
and Escuintla; and support the communication strategy of the Judicial Modernization
Commission – including multilingual materials.

55.

The project has advanced slowly and has been criticized for putting too much
emphasis on building court infrastructure, which is 30% of the budget. However, the
program also includes strengthening for 200 Justice of the Peace courts. The
alternative dispute resolution program established in 20 centers nationwide is an
effective, low-cost strategy for reducing the burden on the court system. The Bank’s
support to reform in human resources management has led to increased employment
of women judges (up from 3% to 17% during the life of the project) and indigenous
staff (with Mayan language speakers up from 100 to 1000).

56.

The involvement of many donors in the sector has led to tensions and conflicts.
USAID promotes a different model for local judicial process from the World Bank
project and there have been conflicts over geographical areas of influence in the
program to strengthen the offices of the Justices of the Peace. In the future, the Bank
should pay more attention to donor coordination and should increase the emphasis
given to institutional strengthening of the new system.

57.

Privatization and competitiveness. This program advanced aggressively under the
Arzu administration, including the privatization of telephones and electricity
distribution, but went into slow motion when the FRG was elected. The Bank’s $20.3
million competitiveness project (approved in FY01) had $18.7 million still undisbursed at the end of FY04. The new administration will give new impetus to the
competitiveness program in the CAFTA framework.

58.

The benefits of the telephone privatization program are clear. Over the last decade
the number of fixed lines rose from 400,000 to one million; and of cellular phones,
from 30,000 to 1.2 million. In electricity, following the privatization of distribution, a
$333 million rural electrification fund was created. Coverage increased from 77% to
91% in 2000-2004 and is projected to reach 98% by 2010. There has also been

14

increased private investment in generation. However, the subsidy system in the Social
Tariff law is badly targeted and expensive, and the “stranded costs” of old PPA
generation contracts are leading to profound financial stress. To address these issues,
the new CAS should support strengthening electricity regulation.
59.

Land administration. Improved land registry is identified as a major goal in the
peace accords and the Bank supported a pilot program in Petén to improve municipal
cadastres, through a $31 million loan approved in 1998, which was about two-thirds
disbursed at the end of FY04. The project takes advantage of a special law that allows
the Government to adjudicate land in the Petén. The lack of a national cadastre law
prevented this in the rest of the country. However, the project was seen as a pilot for a
program that would eventually cover the whole country, once adequate legislation
was in place, under a follow-on project. However, the transfer of the model to the rest
of the country has not yet developed, due to the failure to pass a modern law of
cadastre and land registry. The proposed law was developed during the FRG
administration but is presently stuck in Congress. There is no consensus on the need
to restrict the cadastre and titling process to technical matters. The conclusion of this
reform process should be a high priority for the next CAS. The Bank should then
expand its support to cadastre and registry into other areas of Guatemala.

60.

Financial sector. The most important shift of emphasis in the 2002 CAS update
was the incorporation of a major (US$150 million) Financial Sector Adjustment
Credit (FSAC) to address the banking crisis that developed in 2001. The background
to the crisis was rapid financial sector liberalization in the 1990s, when the monetary
authorities approved the creation of many new banks, taking the total to 35, in the
context of a weak regulatory framework. By 2001, three medium sized banks had
collapsed, and the Bank of Guatemala bailed out the depositors at a cost of 0.6% of
GDP. However, two other banks were also in trouble. There was a need to liquidate
or consolidate these institutions, shore up the legislative framework and prevent
contagion to the rest of the system.

61.

In this setting, in 2002 the Bank provided vital support to the passage of four new
laws: the Central Bank law, the law of the Bank Superintendence, the Monetary Law,
and the Law of Banks and Financial Groups. The reforms brought the Guatemalan
legislation into line with financial orthodoxy. The new Central Bank law limits its
function to maintaining price stability, and creates a mandatory lender-of-last resort
function with a ceiling on lending of 50% of the borrower’s capital. The interest rate
is set at a penal level. The Junta Monetaria is given a mandate by the Monetary Law
to review liquidity and solvency indicators of all banks and financial institutions. It
also establishes capital adequacy parameters based on Basle principles and a
minimum capital sum for establishing a new bank of Q103 million. A stronger bank
resolution procedure was also established. The result has been a radical turn-around.
By mid 2004, the average capital adequacy had increased to 15% and all banks in the
system were above the minimum of 10%. The number of banks has been reduced to
25. The Supervision agency has conducted detailed portfolio evaluations of all the
banks. By 2003 the sector was out of danger.

62.

The first $50 million disbursement of the FSAC (in December 2002) was assigned
to the Deposit Guarantee Fund (FOPA). Due to the relative stability of the system
15

since that date, this money remains unused and the FOPA is being gradually
capitalized with government contributions. The disbursement of the second $50 mn
tranche of the FSAC was imminent at the end of FY04. This tranche is to be
channeled into a Trust Fund for bank capitalization, as is the third tranche,
programmed for December 2005. However, given the strong progress of the
Guatemalan banking system in the two years since the FSAC was approved, it may
make sense to re-assign the final tranche for general budgetary support.
B.2.3 Cross-cutting Outcomes
63.

Apart from the project-specific outcomes discussed in the foregoing review of the
lending portfolio, the CAS also proposed to support cross-cutting outcomes across the
board. Five such outcomes are discussed in this section: increased consultation and
participation in the design of Bank projects; strengthened gender policies and
indigenous rights; greater decentralization; improved macroeconomic policy and
reduced corruption activities.

64.

Consultation and participation on the design and implementation of Bank
projects. The review team found successful participatory approaches in many parts of
the Bank portfolio, both of investment projects (such as the rural roads project which
worked with the mancomunidad of mayors in San Marcos, and the PDL project) and
non-lending activities – such as the GUAPA study and the recent Drivers of Rural
Growth exercise. However, it would be stretching the point to say that the program as
a whole was characterized by a participatory approach. Many lending operations
(such as SIAF and SAT) did not lend themselves to this, and others, that did, such as
the SIF project, were not rigorous in applying these approaches.

65. Gender and indigenous rights Indigenous groups suffer the continuing consequences
of centuries of social and economic discrimination and the Peace Accords,
commitments are made on the indigenous and women’s’ rights. The country made
headway in indigenous rights during the CAS period, as reflected in the dismantling
of the military police and the strengthening of the civil police and justice systems; and
in the increased assignment of resources to indigenous areas. Nevertheless, much
remains to be done. While 51% of Guatemalans are poor, 76% of the indigenous
population is poor. Similarly, in the area of gender discrimination, much remains to
be done. The ratio of girls to boys in primary education is 0.88.
66.

The Bank has supported indigenous populations through the choice of
intervention sites and through the development of Mayan language materials in the
education and judicial reform projects. Work on gender and ethnicity has been
supported by PROGENIAL. This project, which began in 2001, evaluates the gender
and ethnicity dimension of projects, develops indicators, provides TA to promote
community participation; and promotes relevant research. PROGENIAL has worked
with the social fund projects (SIF and PDL); the land projects (Land Fund, Land
Administration) and the rural roads projects. It has recommended that all Bank
projects should include an indigenous development plan and promote dialogue with
indigenous groups; that the Bank should hire more indigenous Guatemalans and
women; and that data on gender and indigenous-specific indicators should be
collected for impact evaluation purposes.

16

67. Decentralization and regional development in San Marcos. During the CAS period,
many Bank interventions were targeted to the indigenous area of San Marcos, one of
the poorest regions of the country. The Review Team visited the San Marcos office
and interviewed Bank staff, bank project counterparts, other donors active in the
region and members of civil society about the development of the bank’s program in
San Marcos. The Bank’s regional focus in San Marcos was endorsed by these
consultations. The end of the civil war and the strong inflow of support from many
different donors have led to radical improvements in living conditions in the San
Marcos altiplano. However, there is little donor coordination at the regional level in
San Marcos. In the absence of a clear regional development strategy each donor
develops their own priorities. Nor is the Bank’s own program strongly coordinated
between the different projects. Most projects are run from central government
agencies such as INIFOM, Fontierras and PRODERE. So the synergies resulting from
the geographical overlay of the different projects are accidental, not systematic.
68.

There was a consensus among the donors consulted on the importance of
developing a regional development and poverty reduction vision – which is valid not
only for San Marcos but for all regions of the country. The crystallization of entities
such as the mancomunidades allow for strategic thinking on local development that is
often difficult at municipal level, both because resources are insufficient and because
the infrastructure issues surpass municipal frontiers. It is recommended that in the
new CAS, the Bank should reinforce the geographical concentration of its program in
the high poverty, indigenous areas of the country and address the ways that project
teams can be coordinated within the bank program and with other donors active in the
areas where its work is concentrated.

69. Macroeconomic policy, growth and poverty reduction. Increasing economic growth
was a central goal of the 1998 CAS. The goal for GDP growth was 5% - 6%. In the
2002 Update, the emphasis shifted from raising growth above the historic trend, to
trying to increase the “elasticity” between growth and poverty reduction. Growth was
targeted at 4% and a target was added to reduce extreme poverty from 16% in 2000 to
12% by 2005. The GUAPA study shows that if per-capita growth can be stabilized at
1.3% a year (consistent with total GDP growth of 4% a year) the extreme poverty rate
could be reduced from 16% in 2003 to 10.4% in 2010 and 8.6% by 2020.
70.

Guatemalan macroeconomic policy is traditionally conservative, with a strong
commitment to fiscal control and monetary stability. A Standby Agreement program
agreed with the IMF in 2003 was successfully completed. But real GDP growth fell to
2.1% in 2003, the lowest level for many years, due the recession in the USA and the
fall in business confidence during the Portillo administration. In this setting, it is
unlikely the poverty reduction goals have been met. This has led to renewed interest
in the need to stimulate faster growth.

71.

In 2004 the Bank prepared a CEM which roots the cause of slow growth in poor
total factor productivity growth. Among the factors causing this trend are deficient
infrastructure and education coupled with sluggish technological change, and
business climate deficiencies affecting both Foreign Direct Investment and domestic
investment demand. The study also highlights the steady appreciation of the real
exchange rate as an underlying factor tending to sap growth.
17

72. To increase the elasticity between growth and poverty reduction, Guatemala needs to
increase the share of GDP channeled into education and other social programs and
infrastructure investments. This, in turn, will require increased taxation. Guatemala
will need to surpass the modest target for tax revenue of 12% of the GDP set in the
Peace Accords if it is to establish an adequate human capital basis for
competitiveness and growth in the 21st century. In the new CAS period the Bank
should aim to play a leading role in policy dialogue on macroeconomic policy and
growth and poverty reduction.
73.

Procurement and anti corruption. Corruption is one of the most controversial
issues in Guatemala, as underlined by the accusations against members of the Portillo
administration. With the support of the WBI, the Bank has worked to establish an
Anti Corruption Commission. The Bank has promoted many initiatives to create a
public sector less exposed to corruption and abuse, such as modernization of the land
registry, tax reform, improved administration of public finances, and the reform of the
administration of justice. The financial sector reforms increase transparency and
reduce opportunities for future bail-outs using taxpayers money. Wisely, the Bank
slowed disbursement its portfolio towards the end of the Portillo administration, as it
became clear that abuses were being committed.

B.2.4 The Bank program’s impact on the country’s long term strategic goals
74.

Some of the activities supported under the CAS were very successful and made
decisive contributions to the advances shown in Table 1. Among the most important
successes were the contribution of the PRONADE project to increased educational
coverage and the support to the SIAF and financial sector reforms. The contribution
of the Bank’s judicial reform project to the advances registered in this field is more
debatable, due to the delays in the project.

75.

In other areas, where the country development goals were clearly not met,
nevertheless, the Bank’s interventions laid important foundations for future advances.
In cadastre and land titling the Bank-supported Petén model provides a basis for the
implementation of cadastre and titling reform in the rest of Guatemala, once the
necessary legislation has been passed. Similarly, the rural roads project carried out
with a municipal association in San Marcos provides a workable model for
establishing municipal maintenance programs for rural roads country-wide in the
future.

76.

Similarly, although the establishment of the SAT system for tax administration did
not lead to the hoped-for gains, due to the lack of political commitment under the
Portillo administration, nevertheless, the Bank-supported system provides the legal
and technical basis for a rapid improvement in performance and transparency of the
tax administration, once the political will is there. And –notwithstanding the setbacks
on corruption in the closing years of the Portillo administration – the WBI’s work to
support the development of a national Anti Corruption Strategy provides valuable
groundwork for the future. In the field of social funds, although the long-standing
issues around rationalization of the different funds and coordination with sector
strategies and municipal development plans remained largely unresolved, the Bank-

18

promoted dialogue around these issues laid the foundations for the implementation of
reforms under the new administration.
77.

Several of the studies supported under the A&A part of the Bank’s program also
had important impacts. In particular, the poverty study (GUAPA) helped to establish
the importance of the poverty reduction as a policy issue in Guatemala and the studies
to support the financial sector reform process were critical to mobilizing the political
support needed to get these controversial reforms through the Congress. The set of
policy notes developed in early 2004 covering most areas of the country’s
development agenda also provided an important catalyst to discussion with the
incoming administration.

78.

In a few areas, unfortunately, the Bank’s program made little contribution to the
planned Outcomes, and the country made little headway towards the Strategic Goals
laid out in the CAS . Particularly disappointing are the lack of progress on land access
– due, arguably, to an unworkable model in the Land Fund – and on natural resources
management – where the Congress failed to ratify a new project prepared by the Bank
for the Western Altiplano, which finally had to be cancelled in 2004.

C

Bank Performance

C.1 Commitments, disbursements and portfolio performance
79.

The 1998 CAS outlined a 3-year program for FY99-FY01. The 2002 CAS Update
outlined a new program for FY 02-03. In the 1998 CAS, $310 million was to be
committed in the Base Case scenario. By program area, Poverty Reduction was to be
the main recipient of new investment approvals (in the range $142 mn to $197 mn).
Social Cohesion would receive between $75 mn and $100 mn. Economic
Management would get between $17 mn and $27 mn. Public Sector Modernization
would receive between $20 and $50 mn. The 2002 CAS Update outlined a new
program of $310 million for FY 02-03.

80.

In the CAS period FY99-01 a total of $249.5 million was approved, 20% less than
the $310 million that had originally been expected. Of the 12 lending operations
originally planned in the 1998 CAS, six failed to reach approval or were cancelled
before implementation: Low Income Barrios; the Post Conflict and Public Sector
project, Rural financial markets; Rural Roads; Natural Resources and the Power
Guarantee. These shortfalls were offset by increased funding for the SIF, basic
education, competitiveness, and the land fund and land administration projects. The
other projects were approved at similar values to those indicated in the CAS. Total
commitments for the Update period of FY02-03 were $278 million, 90% of the
programmed amount of $310 million.

19

81.

Table 4 summarizes disbursements through the CAS period. The Bank had 13
projects open in Guatemala at the time of this review (mid 2004), including one
approved by the Board but not yet approved by the Guatemalan Congress. Two of
these projects predate the CAS period under review (tax administration and rural and
main roads, both approved in FY98. The delays in the tax administration project are
partly attributable to Congressional resistance to spending on T.A., which led to a
renegotiation to channel the funds into buildings. Six of the seven new projects
approved during FY99-01 are still open. The only project to have been closed to date
is the social fund project, FIS II. Five of the projects have been extended. The two
social fund projects and the two land projects were restructured. Of the total of $249.5
million approved in this period, 46% is un-disbursed. Much of this is attributable to
the basic education project, which has only disbursed 16% of the approved amount.
This was due to a lack of commitment of the Portillo administration to PRONADE;
the project is presently being restructured.

Of the five new projects approved under the CAS Update for FY02-03, four are
open and one .has been cancelled due to failure to get the approval of the Guatemala
Congress. Of the total approved amount of $277.8 million, 79% is un-disbursed. The
only project which had disbursed a significant amount by the end of FY04 was the
Financial Sector Adjustment Loan, which released the first of three $50 million
tranches in FY02, and accounts for 86% of all funds disbursed in that interval. The
cancelled loan is the Western Altiplano project, which was approved by the Bank
Board in May 2003 but was not approved by Congress within the 18 month limit date.

20

82.

The declared goal in the 1998 CAS of improving the performance of the Bank
portfolio through better liaison with the client has not yet been achieved. On the
contrary, through the CAS period under review, the performance of the portfolio
deteriorated. Nor has the hoped-for increase in Congressional buy-in to the Bank’s
projects materialized.

83.

In total, $300 million was disbursed in FY99-04, an average of $50 million a year.
Disbursements fell sharply in FY04 due to the political cycle (the 2003 elections) and
rising concerns about corruption of the Portillo administration. Table 5 shows
indicators for the quality of the portfolio and its management. Between 1999 and
2004, the average age to date of projects in the portfolio crept up by 86%, to 3.9 years
and the disbursement ratio fell from 24% to 12.5%. One consequence of this slowdown was an increase in the cost of some of the project implementation units. Of the
nine projects currently active in the portfolio for which it was possible to obtain the
relevant information, five have incurred a ratio of PIU cost to total disbursed loan
costs, above the planned ratio.

C.2 Donor coordination and liaison with government counterparts
84.

Following the Peace accords, donor activity in Guatemala expanded strongly. As
of December 31, 2003 there was a total of available funding commitments (including

21

World Bank) of $ 1.610 billion. Of these 73.1% ($1.175 billion) are reimbursable
funds (loans) and 26.9% ($ 434 million) are non-reimbursable funds (grants). The
largest lender is the IADB with a total of $ 521.84 million in un-disbursed
commitments, followed by CABEI ($ 338.3 million) and the World Bank ($ 292.05
million). In terms of bilateral and multilateral non-reimbursable development
assistance, the most important donor is the EU, with a total of $ 200.59 million to be
disbursed. Germany, USA, Norway, and Japan complete the list of the five most
significant donors with $ 62.81 million, $ 49.8 million, $ 27.21 million, and $25.4
million respectively to be disbursed.

Note: 1/ Due to lack of information CABEI funding was distributed

The CAS laid out the evenly amongst the four sectors
different sector interests and some specific agreements to share areas of influence
with partner agencies such as the IADB. The Bank played an important role
coordinating donor efforts in the road sector, where the IDB, CABEI, and Japan are
all active. However, inadequate coordination with other donors remains weakness in
many areas, such as the education and judicial reform fields, and Government
counterparts in the Finance Ministry felt that the Bank did not communicate well
about ongoing operations. The problems arise, in part, due to the lack of task manager
presence in-country, and the low staffing at the Resident Mission. This review
recommends that the Bank assign more resources in-country to achieve a better
dialogue with other donors and government counterparts.

C.3 Policy dialogue
87.

Policy dialogue was an important component of the CAS. The AAA program
made important contributions to policy debate and the World Bank Institute (WBI)
carried out an extensive program of training and dialogue activities.

88.

The Bank’s Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA) supported many of the
CAS Outcomes. Between FY99-04 disbursements on AAA accounted for $3.37
million, representing 17% of the total expended for direct program costs, compared
with a LAC average of 25% and a Bank-wide average of 27% (Table 7). Among the
most important activities were the Poverty Study (known as GUAPA) and the
supporting studies for the Financial Sector adjustment program. Close to completion
at the end of FY04 were a Country Economic Memorandum and sector notes for the

22

social sector (covering education, health and social funds), rural infrastructure, land
issues and tax administration, which aimed to inform discussions on the new CAS.

89.

A QAG review of AAA support covering FY01-04 found a very positive impact
for this dimension of the Bank Group’s support to Guatemala. The review rated
Bank’s financial sector analysis, in support of the reform process in that sector, as
“best practice” for the promotion of ownership and coalitions for change. The Poverty
Study (GUAPA) and environmental studies carried out by ESMAP were similarly
rated. The Poverty Study has been used by the Government to support the design of
improved targeting in poverty oriented programs and has become a constant point of
reference for the Vice President’s office in the Berger administration. The QAG also
found that the policy notes prepared in FY04 for the social sectors, on rural
infrastructure, land issues and tax administration will be important in the dialogue
with the authorities around the configuration of the new CAS.

90.

The present evaluation endorses the recommendation of the QAG Review that in
future, the Bank should increase its AAA activities in Guatemala towards the 25% of
total program observed in the region. QAG suggested that the Bank should work
further on the financial sector, poverty, on a Public Expenditure Review and value for
money auditing in the public sector; should support the government in procurement
reform and review the role of UNDP in procurement to ensure that institution and
capacity building are achieved. Finally, it recommends increased emphasis on
practical recommendations for implementing policy advice.

91.

Between 1998-2004, some 1,850 representatives from Guatemalan government
agencies, civil society organizations, academia, and the private sector participated in
WBI courses, conferences, GDLN dialogues, and other learning programs. Programs
included courses on utilities regulation, municipal development, trade policy, urban

23

management, water and sanitation, and social inclusion. Areas of particular focus
were decentralization and control of corruption, where WBI provided training to
municipal officials and worked with the government and civil society to launch a
detailed diagnostic survey as input to a national action plan.
D

Conclusions and recommendations
D.1

What went well and what went badly

92. The Bank projects and other activities were highly relevant to the Guatemalan
development agenda, and many of them made decisive contributions to the Peace
Accords agenda laid out 1996. Particularly noteworthy are the contribution of
PRONADE to expanding basic education coverage and community involvement; the
impact of the rural roads project to improving access and defining a model for
sustainable maintenance; the impact of the land administration project on titling in the
Petén; the impact of SIAF on public sector financial management; and the impact of
the Bank in support of financial sector strengthening and modernization in 2002.
Several projects developed participatory approaches, leading to high ownership and
increased development effectiveness, although this was not the case with all parts of
the portfolio. The intervention in San Marcos ensured a strong orientation towards the
indigenous population, as did development of Mayan language materials in the
education and justice projects. In policy dialogue, the Bank produced important
studies such as the GUAPA, the studies supporting the FSAP, and the CEM, which
provide a good basis for the new CAS.
93. In other areas, the CAS program had more difficulty achieving its goals. This arose,
in part, from the lack of government commitment during 2000-2003 to aspects of the
reform agenda laid out in 1998. It is also due to disagreements in Guatemalan society
about how to go forward. The unresolved issues surrounding decentralization made it
difficult to register clear gains in this area. The Fontierra project was affected by the
incongruence of the model adopted by the Government. The rural financing and
natural resources components of the CAS program virtually evaporated. The
Competitiveness program stagnated for 4 years during the FRG administration. The
SAT tax administration project made reasonable technical headway but could do little
to offset the hostile political climate in 2000-2003; and the Judicial Reform project
made uneven progress. In all these fields, there is a need to inject new impetus. In the
last two years of the FRG government there was a general malaise linked to the
governance and transparency crisis. The only exception was the FSAP operation,
managed by the autonomous Central Bank and support by the IBRD, IMF and IADB.
D.2 Recommendations
94. The new CAS should seek to ensure stronger overall programmatic cohesion. To this
end, a significant part of the portfolio should be committed to programmatic lending,
which is better suited to addressing the policy and institutional issues than traditional
investment projects. The Bank should support Guatemala’s efforts to engender a
broad consensus on national development strategy, building on the 1996 Peace
Accords, taking account the opportunities that arise from CAFTA. From a fiduciary

24

point of view, the advances with SIAF (including Gautecompras) provide a solid
basis for a move towards programmatic lending. The upcoming CFAA and PER
should validate these achievements and identify issues that still need to be resolved.
95. The Bank should consider ways to reduce the relatively high cost of project
implementation by ensuring timely completion and by reducing the program’s
dependence on relatively expensive PIUs. A shift towards fewer, larger operations
and increased programmatic lending would help reduce the high transactions costs
associated with a plethora of small ring-fenced projects. This would help reduce
management costs and increase alignment with the government’s own processes.
Efforts to simplify documentation requirements, to the extent feasible, would also
help improve the rate of disbursement.
96. The present fiscal crisis provides an opportunity for the Bank to achieve high returns
from increasing budgetary support. The Government is committed to increasing
spending on basic programs but also wants to maintain the fiscal deficit at an
acceptable level. This circle can only be squared if the tax burden is increased.
However, this will take time to achieve, since the main effort will be placed on
removing exemptions and closing loopholes. By assigning resources to budgetary
support, the Bank will help to alleviate the fiscal crisis, and will provide bridging
finance for key programs (such as basic education and rural infrastructure), pending
the crystallization of increased tax revenues in the future.
97. The country’s strategy for growth and poverty reduction should include the following
key elements: Reduction of poverty and race-related inequality: Guatemala must
increase public spending on social and productive to reduce poverty and raciallyrelated inequality and to improve its human capital situation. The tax take should rise
from the present level of around 10% of GDP towards the levels observed in
neighboring countries. The Bank should continue to participate strongly in policy
dialogues in support of this goal. Growth: Guatemala urgently needs to recover and
surpass the growth trend of 4% increases in real GDP observed in the 1990s. Faster
growth can be achieved through improved infrastructure, a more competitive
investment climate, and support to high-potential sectors. The recently completed
CEM suggests priority areas for action. Governance: the legitimacy of the authorities
must be improved through continued advance in judicial reform, citizen security, and
improvements in the quality of political dialogues and processes. To ensure the
legitimacy of increased public spending, fiscal accountability, transparency and anti
corruption programs need to be highlighted. And the efficiency, effectiveness and
equity of spending must be shored up to ensure improved services reach the poor.
98. A stronger policy dialogue is likely to yield positive returns in deepening consensus
around these points. The Bank should increase the presence of senior staff in the field
and assign more resources to analytical and advisory activities. However, it would be
unrealistic to expect to achieve full policy consensus quickly in all sectors. The Bank
should develop dialogues in and orient the lending program towards the high priority
sectors where the development impacts are likely to be significant and there is good
potential for progress. Candidate areas for priority treatment in this context might
include: Governance and public sector modernization; Decentralization and rural
development; Education; Land policy and titling.

GUATEMALA: COUNTRY FINANCING PARAMETERS
Item
Cost sharing. Limit on the
proportion of individual project
costs that the Bank may finance

Parameter
100 percent

Recurrent cost financing. Any
limits that would apply to the
overall amount of recurrent
expenditures that the Bank may
finance

No country-level
limit

Local cost financing. Are the
requirements for Bank financing
of local expenditures met,
namely that: (i) financing
requirements for the country’s
development program would
exceed the public sector’s own
resources (e.g., from taxation
and other revenues) and
expected domestic borrowing;
and (ii) the financing of foreign
expenditures alone would not
enable the Bank to assist in the
financing of individual projects
Taxes and duties. Are there any
taxes and duties that the Bank
would not finance?

Yes

None

Remarks / Explanation
Specific arrangements would be
determined for individual projects, based
on project context and the project team’s
judgment of borrower commitment and
ownership. 100 percent financing is
expected to be applied selectively to stay
within the overall CAS lending envelope.
It is expected that the share of financing
would be higher (approaching 100
percent) in the social sectors and in the
governance and public sector management
areas and correspondingly lower in areas
associated with infrastructure investments.
The Bank would exercise caution in
financing recurrent costs. In determining
recurrent cost financing in individual
projects, the Bank will take into account
sustainability issues at the sector and
project levels and implied future
budgetary outlays. Recurrent cost
financing is expected to stay broadly
within the ranges of recent years.
The two requirements are met. The Bank
may therefore finance local costs in the
proportions needed in individual projects.

No taxes or duties are currently identified
as unreasonable or discriminatory. At the
project level, the Bank would consider
whether taxes and duties constitute an
excessively high share of project
expenditures.
