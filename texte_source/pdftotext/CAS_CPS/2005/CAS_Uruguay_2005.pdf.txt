EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Uruguay i s currently in the midst o f a dual transition. First, there i s an economic transition from
the 2002 crisis towards a path o f equitable and sustainable development, as the economy
continues to recover strongly. Second, there i s a political transition, as the victory o f the Frente
Amplio - Encuentro Progresista - Nueva Mayoria coalition in the October 2004 elections
marked a new phase in the country’s political history.
The Government faces three main challenges in order to succeed with the economic transition,
namely: (i)
reducing vulnerability; (ii)
sustaining growth; and (iii)
improving living standards.

The challenge o f reducing vulnerability relates to debt sustainability, fiscal management and
financial sector reforms. Debt sustainability will continue to be a major development challenge
in the medium term given the sharp increase in the public debt to GDP ratio as a result o f the
crisis. Heavy amortizations due in the period 2006-07 constitute a particular source o f
vulnerability. Strong fiscal management w i l l be the key to reducing the debt burden over time
while ensuring an environment o f price and exchange rate stability. Policymakers can build on
Uruguay’s impressive fiscal performance since the crisis which culminated in a primary surplus
o f 3.8 percent o f GDP in 2004.
Meeting the challenge o f putting Uruguay on a path o f higher longer-run growth will depend
upon structural reforms aimed at increasing investment, enhancing competitiveness, and creating
an enabling environment for the private sector. Uruguay’s strong rebound from the crisis, with
12.3 percent growth in 2004, has helped create a sound basis for these reforms.
In improving living standards, the new administration faces the challenge o f bringing the
escalating costs of public pensions and health care under control in order to free up fiscal space
for essential social investments including an expanded social safety net. Uruguay has
experienced a deepening o f social exclusion during the crisis and the new Government i s
committed to addressing the problems associated with society’s most vulnerable groups.

The proposed CAS aims to support the Government’s efforts to meet Uruguay’s development
challenges in areas where the Bank has a comparative advantage. CAS preparation has benefited
from extensive consultations and AAA work. This has included: (i)
public discussion o f a
Sources o f Growth study with the current Minister o f Finance and his immediate predecessor, (ii)
a two day Policy Notes seminar with the’full Cabinet, (iii)
a Client Survey conducted in July
2004 which highlighted widespread interest in maintaining or expanding Uruguay’s relations
with the multilateral financial institutions, (iv) consultations with civil society, and (v) the
lessons learned presented in the Completion Report on the 2000 CAS and the 2002 CAS
Progress Report.
The proposed Bank assistance strategy i s anchored around a series o f programmatic development
loans that are expected to be multi-sectoral in focus and support the Government in key policy
areas including public sector management, financial sector reform, and reform o f social
programs. The investment lending pipeline will be rebuilt with new operations planned to
support priority investments in infrastructure (transport, energy), social programs (reform o f the

i

national health insurance system, support to education), institution building (tax administration,
expenditure management), and innovation, science and technology.
The CAS envisages a base case scenario o f up to US$800 million over the period through fiscal
year 2010. The lending program will be modulated on the strength o f the Government’s program
and its ability to implement it, as well as the country’s creditworthiness and the Bank’s exposure.
Self-correcting mechanisms are built into the CAS to modulate Bank exposure in line with
performance benchmarks.

If the macroeconomic framework, reform implementation, or improvement in debt sustainability
were to fall below expectations, the Bank would revert to a l o w case scenario, with total lending
commitments reduced by at least US$300 million with respect to the base case envelope.
Unsatisfactory portfolio implementation would also be grounds for slowing new investment
lending. Were reform and investment program implementation to exceed expectations, allowing
Uruguay to largely recover its investment grade status, this would open up the perspective o f
accelerated implementation o f the lending program and a possibly enhanced level o f Bank
support to be discussed at the time o f the CAS Progress Report planned for FY08.
Indicative outcomes and results indicators are presented in the CAS Results Matrix. Expected
CAS outcomes will be further refined as required information becomes available. This will be
reflected in the planned CAS Progress Report which will provide a preliminary stocktaking. A
new Client Survey will also be carried out.
Effective collaboration with Uruguay’s other multilateral partners - mainly the IMF and the
IADB - as well as civil society will be instrumental in implementing the CAS. A new three year
Stand-by arrangement has been agreed with IMF staff and i s expected to be presented to the IMF
Board in early June. The IADB is preparing a new Country Strategy for presentation to i t s Board
o f Directors later this year. In implementing the CAS, we have identified activities to assist the
Government in strengthening relationships with civil society.
Notwithstanding the progress o f Uruguay in consolidating its recovery, a number o f important
risks must be acknowledged. Most important i s the risk associated with debt sustainability.
Uncertainty about the new administration’s ability to deliver o n its program o f reforms
constitutes a political and social risk. There are also a number o f other risks such as energy
dependency, IBRD exposure, and the possibility o f new regional shocks.
Executive Directors may wish to discuss, among others, the following issues:
0

0

While the length o f the CAS coincides with the political cycle, the outer years o f the
program have been broadly defined to ensure flexibility and the content o f the policy
lending remains under discussion with the Government. I s the balance between
specijicity andflexibility in the CAS appropriate?
The substantial proposed lending program is intended to assist the new administration to
achieve ambitious growth and social objectives. Program risks have been assessed and
mitigation measures identified. Does the composition and size of the program strike the
right balance between opportunities and risks?

I.INTRODUCTION
A. Overview
Uruguay i s currently in the midst o f a dual transition. First, there i s an economic
transition from the 2002 crisis towards a path o f equitable and sustainable development. The
Uruguayan economy has bounced back since mid-2003 and continues to enjoy a strong recovery.
Real GDP growth in 2004 was 12.3 percent, and the forecast for 2005 i s for further 6 percent
growth. The success with which Uruguay was able to weather the economic crisis o f 2001-02
owes much to i t s prompt and purposeful response to events as they unfolded. The economic
crisis did not provoke a political crisis nor did it interrupt the normal procedures o f government.
Political continuity enabled the Government to manage proactively the economic situation and to
mobilize long established elements o f a social safety net to mitigate, but not prevent, the impact
o f the crisis on poverty. Concerted support from the international financial community was also
important in assisting the difficult adjustment. As a result o f those combined efforts, Uruguay i s
on track to fully recover i t s pre-crisis level o f income (Figure 1). The country i s well positioned
to service i t s sovereign debt and embark upon a path o f sustained growth provided sound
macroeconomic policies and the agenda o f post-crisis structural reform continues to be
implemented.

Second, there i s a political transition. The victory o f the Frente Amplio - Encuentro
Progresista - Nueva Mayoria (FA-EP-NM) coalition in the October 2004 elections ended 170
years o f dominance o f Uruguayan politics by the two traditional parties, the Partido Colorado
and the Partido Nacional. The new Government took office on March 1, 2005. Uruguay i s an
open society and the political transition period has been smooth. The Frente Amplio reached
agreement with the two traditional parties as well as independents on an overall framework for
the conduct o f economic policy, foreign policy and education policies. The resulting "Inter-party
Agreement" o f February 16, 2005, specifically commits all parties to honor the outcome o f the
2003 debt renegotiation. It also acknowledges the need for strict fiscal discipline to satisfy the
urgent social needs o f Uruguay while, at the same time, generating an adequate primary fiscal

1

surplus. Although many specifics s t i l l remain to be determined, it augurs well for stability and
continuity o f the body politic that a multi-partisan agreement could be reached so early in the
new administration.

3.
To accompany Uruguay’s economic and political transition, there i s a need for continued
support from the international financial community. The new administration has worked to
establish a close relationship with multilateral lenders including the Bank, which plans to open
an office in Montevideo in the coming months. The proposed country assistance strategy adopts
a threefold focus:
0

0

Analytical work to help the Government to articulate selected areas o f its program.
Rebuilding o f the investment project pipeline in areas that would enhance growth,
increase competitiveness, and reduce poverty and social exclusion.
Continued development policy lending to support implementation o f strategically
important reforms to help the Government to reduce macroeconomic vulnerability,
sustain growth and improve living standards.

The last CAS, discussed by the Board o f Executive Directors on June 6, 20001, followed
upon a decade o f macroeconomic stability and growth in Uruguay. In view o f the country’s
relatively high level o f economic and social development at the time, the 2000 CAS
contemplated a progressive reduction in Bank support and a transition to graduation. The
relatively strong growth performance o f Uruguay during the nineties was tempered by a sharp
recession in 1999, which was in part a spillover from events in neighboring Argentina and
Brazil. However, when the CAS was prepared, it was not foreseen that the recession would
deepen and the economy would become seriously destabilized late in 200 1 when neighboring
Argentina defaulted upon i t s public debt and devalued i t s currency to one third o f i t s previous
value. A CAS Progress Report2 prepared in mid-2002 covered the truncated period FY03-04, in
comparison to the FYO1-05 program of the original CAS. The Progress Report was prepared at a
time when the economic situation in Uruguay was deteriorating rapidly due, in part, to a run on
bank deposits provoked by events in Argentina. The full dimensions o f the crisis and i t s likely
outcome could not be clearly discerned because events were s t i l l unfolding. Nevertheless, the
2002 Progress Report determined that the 2000 CAS lending scenario was no longer appropriate
and concluded that additional support was needed to assist Uruguay to weather the crisis and to
4.

introduce specific reforms ranging from fiscal measures to increase revenues and curtail
spending, to bank restructuring, promotion o f efficiency and competition in infrastructure,
maintaining investment in human capital and strengthening measures to protect vulnerable
groups.

5.
The rapid pace at which events were developing in 2002 required that the August 2002
Progress Report be supplemented with an Update3 which was discussed by the Board o f
Executive Directors together with the Progress Report on August 8, 2002. The Progress Report
and its Update proposed adjustment lending as the preferred instrument for increased Bank

support to Uruguay during the crisis period. Two Structural Adjustment Loans (SALS)and two
Special Structural Adjustment Loans (SSALs) were envisaged over the period FY03-04 totaling
US$550 million (Box 1). Some operations in the pipeline o f the original 2000 CAS were
delayed, and a new project t o help stem the outbreak o f aftosa resulting in a substantial loss in
competitiveness, was added.
Box 1: Support for Structural Adjustment in Response to Crisis

The CAS Progress Report o f August 2002 proposed adjustment lending as the preferred
instrument for Bank support to Uruguay during the crisis. As a result, the Bank extended
structural adjustment loans to Uruguay in the course o f FY03. The principal characteristics o f
these operations are outlined below. Their implementation i s summarized in Annex 1.
A SAL (SAL I,
Report No. 245 15-UR) in the amount o f US$15 1.5 million was approved
in August 2002. The loan supported macroeconomic and fiscal actions centered on restraining
public sector wages. In addition, the system o f social protection was to be strengthened by
improving management and by safeguarding budget allocations. Unemployment insurance was
to be reformed and training for the unemployed was to be streamlined. A Special SAL (SSAL I,
Report No. 245 15-UR) in the amount o f US$15 1.5 million was also approved in August 2002.
That loan focused specifically on support for restructuring o f the National Mortgage Bank as part
o f a broader reform o f the banking system which was also receiving support from the IMF. Both
the SAL and the Special SAL have been fully disbursed.
In addition, a Public Services and Social Sectors SAL (SAL 11, Report No. 25012-UR) in
the amount o f US$15 1.5 million was approved in April 2003. The overall objective o f the loan
was to boost competitiveness and economic growth through the better provision o f public and
social services and infrastructure. To that end, a broad range o f structural and policy reforms
were identified with respect to infrastructure and public services. A Public Services and Social
Sectors Special SAL ( S S A L 11, Report No. 25012-UR) in the amount o f US$101 million was also
approved in April 2003. That loan aimed at improving the equity and efficiency o f public
expenditures in health and education by supporting measures to improve management and give
budgetary protection to priority programs. The first tranche o f both the Public Services SAL and
Special SAL was disbursed when the loans were approved in April 2003. Two tranches for the
Public Services SAL (for a total amount o f US$lOO million) s t i l l remain to be disbursed and t w c
tranches for the Public Services Special S A L (for a total o f US$75 million) will be cancelled
(para. 89).

The Bank’s response was part o f a concerted multilateral effort, which h r n i s h e d a
combined US$4 billion o f commitments, one o f the largest such efforts as a percentage o f GDP
ever carried out (Table 1). In this context, the IMF took the lead in providing critical emergency
support accounting for over 70 percent o f commitments, with the Bank and the IADB providing
the remainder. The coordinated effort by the international community and the determined policy
response o f the authorities, supported by all o f the major parties, enabled Uruguay to achieve a
recovery that compares favorably with other crisis countries o f the past decade. Looking
forward, the Bank will continue to work with the Vhzquez Government to transfonn what was
essentially a crisis response toward a balanced medium-term assistance program centered on key
investments to sustain growth and promote social development.

In retrospect, it i s clear that the crisis in Uruguay was particularly severe when compared
with other countries that have experienced a crisis in the recent past. I t can be seen from Figure 2
that the decline in GDP f r o m its pre-crisis peak was deeper in the case o f Uruguay than for other
countries including neighboring Argentina. It reflects well o n its adjustment efforts that Uruguay
has been able t o recover so much lost ground relatively quickly. The depth o f the crisis also
provides clear justification for the Government's priority focus o n social programs and the
Bank's support for this objective under the proposed CAS.

A. Political Context

8.
The first-round victory o f the Frente Amplio party in Uruguay’s presidential election on
October 31, 2004 marked the first time in more than 170 years that the executive i s not being
controlled by either o f the two traditional parties-Partido Colorado (PC) and Partido Nacional
(PN). President Vhzquez’s victory after two previous attempts i s interpreted, among other
things, as a certain disenchantment o f the electorate with the governance practices o f the
traditional parties. The recession starting in 1998, the financial crisis in 2002, the dissolution o f
the governing coalition in November o f that same year, the limited scope for renewal in the
ruling party, and poverty levels above 30 percent helped the Frente to win the elections in the
first round with just over 50 percent o f the vote.
9.
Although the F r e n t e has embraced an agenda for change, it has also signaled continuity
in many o f the policies that have enabled the economic rebound. The new Government’s agenda
for sustained growth abides by the recent referendums that have guaranteed a predominant role
for the state in certain strategic economic sectors (Le., water, petroleum, and
telecommunications), while aiming to improve the climate for private sector investment. Initial
indications are that the new administration will be seeking an increased professionalism and
transparency o f the state, maintain prudent macroeconomic policies, and improve rules o f the
game for the private sector as the catalysts for stimulating the private sector in a proactive and
productive role. There appears to be broad consensus within the Frente Amplio on this strategy
and the economic team enjoys a high degree o f respect and broad support. The new
administration has proactively sought dialogue with the International Financial Institutions (IFIs)
and the active support o f these institutions in formulating and implementing i t s development
agenda.
10.
President Vhzquez has begun his presidency with broad support both domestically and
from the international community. The economic environment i s also benign. Recovery from
the crisis years has been robust, and growth should continue to be solid over the near-term.
Unemployment has been cut significantly from the depths o f the crisis and investment i s picking
up. Obstacles remain and some outstanding reforms will continue to be demanding politically.
Nevertheless, the Government i s well positioned to address Uruguay’s development challenges.

B. Recent Economic Developments
11,
Following upon a period o f macroeconomic stability and steady growth during most o f
the nineties, Uruguay suffered a sharp reversal in 1998 with a recession that persisted for more
than three years before collapsing into a deep economic crisis provoked, in large part, by events
in neighboring Argentina. When Argentina defaulted on i t s public debt, abandoned the U S
dollar as a monetary anchor and devalued i t s currency to one third o f i t s previous value, the
effect upon Uruguay was disastrous. There was a rush to withdraw deposits from the banking
system driven initially by the exposure o f Uruguayan banks to Argentina’s country risk and later
for fear that the Government o f Uruguay may follow the example o f Argentina and restrict
withdrawals. As a result, the important offshore banking sector and, eventually, the domestic
5

banking sector came under severe pressure and a number o f banks collapsed, notwithstanding
emergency government support. A ripple effect throughout the economy caused GDP to fall by
some 11 percent in 2002 alone, while unemployment rose to almost 20 percent by end-2002.
12.
It i s likely that the outcome would have been much worse had it not been for an effective
adjustment effort by the Uruguayan authorities, and the consensual nature o f the country’s
political system. The success with which Uruguay was able to weather the economic crisis o f
2001-02 owes much to its prompt and purposeful response to events. Negotiations with creditors
led to the successful conclusion o f a sovereign debt exchange in May 2003, raising the average
maturity o f bonds by over 5 years without increasing interest rates and without a reduction in
principal (Box 2). Fiscal and monetary policy were well managed which resulted in a primary
surplus o f the public sector (excluding sub-national administrations) o f 3.8 percent o f GDP in
2004 (a major turnaround given that there was a primary fiscal deficit o f 1.5 percent o f GDP in
2001). Following a modest pass-through to inflation from the 2002 devaluation (inflation peaked
at 25.8 percent that year), inflation was brought down to single digit figures.

Box 2: Uruguay Debt Restructuring
In April 2003, Uruguay proposed a sovereign debt exchange to all holders o f government bonds
denominated in foreign exchange and having an initial maturity o f 12 months or more. The objective o f the debt
restructuring was to bring debt servicing obligations into line with the country’s prospective post-crisis payment
capacity. Cash-flow relief was to be obtained by extending maturities without reducing the principal due. The
proposal applied to US$3.8 billion o f bonds that had been issued on the international markets and to US$1.6
billion o f bonds issued on the domestic market. It i s estimated that approximately two thirds o f all eligible bonds
were held by residents o f Uruguay.

Two options were offered to bondholders. The f i r s t was to swap existing bonds for new bonds with an
extended maturity but with principal and interest unchanged. A second option was to offer a choice o f altemative
benchmark bonds with different maturities and with cash incentives for bondholders who chose longer benchmark
bond maturities. In the case o f bonds that had been issued on the domestic market, the menu o f options was more
extensive, including progressive step-up interest rates. An important feature o f the debt swap was that all new
bonds were subject to collective action clauses that would facilitate future debt restructuring.
Voluntary participation in the bond swap was 92.5 percent with most participants opting for altemative
benchmark bonds rather than simple extended maturities. The high rate o f participation may be attributed to two
factors. First was prior consultation with creditors before the terms o f the exchange were announced so that
creditors were able to participate in the design o f exchange options. Second was the strong IF1 support for
Uruguay’s adjustment program.
Figure 3 shows how, before the crisis, Uruguay was able to command a much lower spread than other
countries o f Latin America. At the time o f the crisis, the spread for Uruguay rose sharply but, after the successful
renegotiation o f debt with bondholders, it declined quickly and i s now slightly below the average for the Region.

GDP growth in 2004 i s estimated to have been 12.3 percent due in part to good economic
management but also to favorable external developments, including high commodity prices for
exports and strong economic growth in both Argentina and Brazil (Table 2). Consumption and
in particular investment started to recover from 2003 onwards. Prospects for continued
economic growth in 2005 are good. A modest strengthening o f the peso and higher oil prices
will not offset the greatly enhanced competitiveness o f Uruguay which resulted from the 2002
devaluation. Rising employment and some increase in real wages i s likely to boost domestic
demand. Real growth of 6 percent i s projected in 2005 and that would raise per capita incomes
close to pre-crisis levels. At the same time, a disciplined monetary policy together with a modest
appreciation o f the peso i s likely to keep inflation within the 5.5-7.5 percent target range o f the
Central Bank. A primary surplus o f 3.5 percent o f GDP i s targeted in 2005, slightly down from
the 3.8 percent recorded in 2004 in order to accommodate the new Government's social
emergency program.

C. The Social Impact o f the Crisis

14.
The 1998 recession and the subsequent economic crisis had a severe social impact.
Unemployment increased from about 10 percent in 1998 to 17 percent at the end o f 2002 (Figure
5), albeit this figure declined to 13 percent by the end o f 2004. During the period from 1998 to
2002, the proportion of self-employed and o f those employed in the informal sector also grew
and was accompanied by a reduction in real wages in the private sector. Household income also
started to decline in 1998, and f e l l by more than a fifth in the period from 1998 to the end o f
2002 as it was negatively impacted b y poor performance o f the labor market in terms o f job
creation and wage behavior. As a result, according to data from the Instituto Nacional de
Estadistica (INE), poverty increased between 2000 and 2003 from 18 percent to 3 1 percent o f
the population, while extreme poverty also doubled to 2.8 percent o f the population during the
same period. Despite this increase, extreme poverty remained l o w in Uruguay with respect to the
8

other Latin American countries. The strong economic recovery has yet to be reflected in an
improvement the overall poverty rate. Income inequality has traditionally been l o w in Uruguay
when compared to the rest o f the region. However, inequality also increased during the period
between 1998 and 2002 (Figure 6), and this exerted a significant negative effect o n poverty.

15.
While poverty and unemployment increased to record levels in the aftermath o f the crisis,
the Government response mitigated a potentially much stronger negative impact o n both quantity
and quality o f service delivery. Repercussions o n basic social indicators such as school
enrollment and infant mortality were largely avoided and, in some cases, the indicators continued
to improve (Annex B5).

111. THE GOVERNMENT’S DEVELOPMENT AGENDA
16.
The new Government’s program as enunciated in Tabark Vhzquez’s electoral document
E l Gobierno de Cambio - La Transicidn Responsable suggests a broad continuity o f
macroeconomic policies, which i s in line with the traditional consensus style o f government in
Uruguay, but with increased emphasis on social programs and confirmation o f a central role o f
the state. The document proposes a new national development strategy for the country
articulated along six key complementary themes: enhancing productivity (Uruguay Productivo),
fostering social development (Uruguay Social), promoting innovation (Uruguay Innovador),
strengthening democracy (Uruguay Democrdtico), enhancing regional and global integration
(Uruguay Integrado) and promoting policies which consolidate and promote Uruguayan culture
(Uruguay Cultural).

17.
In a nutshell, the program o f the new administration aims at attaining economic
development in manner which i s at the same time productive, integrated, equitable, o f good
quality and sustainable. Development should be productive in that it should leave room for
promoting areas as diverse as biotechnology, information and communication technology,
tourism and culture-based on the premise that while no country can be competitive in all areas,
it would be wrong to limit unnecessarily areas in which Uruguay might achieve regional and
international competitiveness. Development should be trade-oriented and better integrated with
both Mercosur partners and beyond. Development should also be equitable in a territorial sense,
so as not to give way to disparities among areas which are labeled as successful and areas which
are labeled as depressed. Development should be o f good quality in that it should maximize a
national production which i s competitive and qualified - which i s based on, good educational
quality for all, leading to equal employment opportunities, especially for the youth. Development
should finally be sustainable, not only in environmental but also in social terms - and poverty
should therefore be fought with policies aimed at civil participation and social inclusion.
A. Uruguay Productivo
18.
Uruguay Productivo places high and sustained growth as a top priority in the
Government’s agenda. This will be attained through the coherent implementation o f structural
changes and short-term economic policies. Structural changes will aim to establish clear rules o f
the game between the State and the market, to transform the financial sector, to develop capital
markets and de-dollarize the economy. “Uruguay Productivo” also calls for state reforms,
including improving professional and technical qualification o f civil servants, enhancing
transparency and accountability in the conduct o f state functions, decentralizing management and
eradicating all forms o f clientelism. The Government plan further calls for promoting public
investment through the use o f both own resources and external credits and for including the
private sector as a concessionary under certain conditions. An additional structural reform
contemplated by the proposed program i s tax reform, which should be guided by the principle o f
fairness and serve as a stimulus to productive investment. Tax reform will encompass
introduction o f a personal income tax. Another major change that the Government intends to
introduce i s that o f seeking stronger ties with Mercosur. The plan also calls for improvements in
extra- regional commercial relations, thereby continuing to build on the dynamism o f exports to
these markets.
10

B. Uruguay Social

19.
Uruguay Social underscores the need to transform the quality o f l i f e o f Uruguayans with
special emphasis on the most vulnerable, thereby fostering social inclusion. One o f the first
actions o f the new Administration was the creation o f a new Social Emergency Program called
PANES (Plan de Asistencia Nacional a la Emergencia Social). The objective o f the plan i s to
attend to the needs of individuals below the extreme poverty line or in high risk o f falling below
it - estimated to include some 200,000 individuals, or 6 percent o f the population - through a set
o f eight, coordinated programs (basic food, health emergency, minimum income, education for
critical areas, workfare, two housing programs, and homelessness). Several o f these programs are
not new, but in the past they have not been very effective in reaching the poor. The emergency
plan seeks to overcome these obstacles and reach the neediest in society, using the structure o f
existing institutions (such as the BPS) and volunteers. Enrollment in the program began on April
1, and nearly 100,000 heads o f household applied in the first month (they will be individually
interviewed and assessed to identify targeted households). Payments o f the minimum income
scheme, for approximately US$50 a month, are expected to start in May 2005. The implementing
agency i s the new Ministry o f Social Development which i s s t i l l being organized.
20.
The incoming administration has also put education high on i t s agenda, including a
promise to raise overall funding for the education sector to improve equity, improving
achievements, and making school education more relevant for the labor market. This would
require a legal reform which the incoming administration has announced as part o f i t s Uruguay
Social program. The new Government has indicated that i t s goal in the health sector i s to create a
more harmonized system through the introduction o f a national health insurance that would
ensure more equitable access to services and improved quality o f care, while reducing the
financial burden of the system. In that context, a key strategic need would be to improve the
incentive framework for all actors in the system, primarily through reducing fragmentation and
increasing the effectiveness o f financial and regulatory incentives for efficiency and equity.
C. Uruguay Innovador
21.
Uruguay Innovador focuses on the need to promote scientific and technological progress
in order to reverse the current trend o f stagnation and centers on a strategy o f specialization and
increased quality. Under Uruguay Innovador, the incoming administration lays out i t s goal to (i)
revamp existing institutional relationships within the creation o f a National System o f
Innovation; (ii)draft a strategic innovation plan for the country which would bring together
priority sectors (including agro-industry, natural resource conservation, technology and
communications, the health system, manufacturing and tourism); (iii)orientate the entire
education system, most importantly the Universidad de la Repziblica, towards scientific and
technological applied research with strong l i n k s to the productive sector; and (iv) support
innovation in the small and medium enterprise sector.

D. Uruguay Democratic0
22.
Uruguay Democrdtico emphasizes among other the need for greater transparency and
efficiency o f government, including the decentralization o f functions in government and the
strengthening o f the internal auditing, the promotion o f greater transparency and social

11

participation in the media, and the need for an agile judicial system which i s perceived by civil
society as an effective instrument to defend the rights o f the citizens.

E. Uruguay Integrado
23.

Uruguay Integrado points to need o f strengthening relations between Uruguay and i t s
neighbors, and particularly the need to strengthen ties within the Mercosur, especially during the
second semester of 2005 when Uruguay will assume the rotating presidency o f the union. I t also
calls for a better integration o f Uruguay with the rest o f the world economy.

F. Uruguay Cultural

24.

Uruguay Cultural emphasizes the need to promote the cultural debate in the country in
order to instill in the citizenship a sense o f democratic dignity, o f collective growth and learning,
and o f plurality. Most importantly, culture should promote diversity as the basis for social
inclusion and the creation o f a cultural identity.

12

IV. URUGUAY’S DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES
25.
Uruguay i s s t i l l struggling to recover from the social and economic consequences o f the
prolonged recession over 1999-2001 and the deep crisis o f 2002. However, now that the
economy i s rebounding from the crisis, the Government’s priorities have shifted from crisis
response to the achievement o f the longer-term objective o f equitable and sustainable economic
development. In addition, an overarching goal o f the Government’s program i s that o f fostering
social participation and increasing inclusion. The following sections outline the main challenges
the Government needs to address, both at the macroeconomic level and in key sectors o f the
economy, in order to attain its objective.
A. Reducing Vulnerability
26.
Debt sustainability w i l l continue to be a major development challenge in the medium
term notwithstanding the successful debt restructuring o f 2003 which provided relief from

liquidity pressures in the bond market (accounting for about half o f all sovereign debt) over the
short and medium term. After restructuring, the ratio o f public debt to GDP i s estimated to have
stood at nearly 90 percent at end-2004 (Figure 7). Heavy amortizations due in the period 200607, including payments to the IFIs, constitute a source o f vulnerability.

Debt sustainability will depend critically upon generating a primary fiscal surplus
sufficient to service the debt and that issue will be examined in greater detail in the following
section. Over and beyond fiscal considerations, however, debt sustainability will also depend

27.

13

upon managing the debt proactively to ensure that its size, i t s term-structure and i t s currency
composition correspond to the needs and to the repayment capacity o f Uruguay.

The currency composition o f Uruguay’s debt has become a major focus o f public
28.
attention ever since the 2002 economic crisis revealed how readily a debt denominated in foreign
currency can expose the economy to external vulnerabilities. A public debt denominated in
foreign currency restricts the maneuverability o f the central bank to manage monetary policy and
an insufficiency of peso denominated instruments may also stifle the development o f the
domestic capital market by making it more vulnerable to the exchange rate. The prevailing
sentiment in Uruguay favors issuing more peso denominated debt in both domestic and
international markets (in particular, indexed peso debt), rather than debt denominated in foreign
exchange, to the extent that the costs o f borrowing in pesos are competitive.
29.
A strong foreign exchange reserve position and a favorable debt composition are essential
elements o f sound integrated asset and liability management which can help the Government
better manage the roll-over o f debt as it falls due. As o f March 2005, the international reserves
o f Uruguay were equivalent to 8.4 months o f imports, sufficient to cover projected public debt
service in 2005. To further strengthen i t s liquidity cushion, Uruguay could require financial
institutions to carry liquidity reserves on foreign currency deposits that are higher for nonresidents and inversely related to the maturity o f the deposit.

Fiscal management i s one o f the principal instruments available to the Government in
30.
pursuing the objective o f sustained growth with equity. The new administration has signaled i t s
intention to maintain tight fiscal policy. In addition to issues o f debt sustainability discussed in
the previous section, strong fiscal management will be a sine qua non for macroeconomic
stability and growth. Whereas, in many other areas o f economic and social policy the
Government may have an ample choice o f options, there will be few degrees o f freedom in
conducting fiscal policy.
31.
After restructuring the public debt in 2003, Uruguay continued to strengthen i t s fiscal
position (Figure 8). This policy stance will need to be maintained in order to achieve primary
surpluses compatible with debt sustainability. The primary surplus i s expected to be maintained
at 3.5 percent o f GDP in 2005 and increase to 3.7 percent in 2006 and to 4 percent o f GDP from
2007 onwards. Projections indicate that fiscal reforms will be required to achieve primary
surpluses o f this order (Annex 2). In addition to several new revenue initiatives and more
efficient tax collection, by far the most effective way to increase fiscal revenues i s to accelerate
the rate o f GDP growth.

32.
Options for increasing fiscal revenues are few. The new administration has pledged to
introduce a personal income tax and that could provide a significant new source o f revenue in the
longer-run. However, a personal income tax i s administratively complex and it will need to be
carefully planned and prepared ifit i s to be applied effectively and equitably. It will take time
for procedures and administrative structures to be put in place. Meanwhile, the Government will
need to rely upon already established sources o f fiscal revenue. There are particularly good
prospects for enhancing revenues from social security contributions which declined from 6.1
percent o f GDP in 2000 to 3.7 percent o f GDP in 2003. Better coordination between the Tax
Administration Department (DGI) and the agency which administers the social security system

14

(BPS) could, aided by the on-going economic recovery, result in a rebound o f revenues from
currently l o w levels.

33.
The main challenges confronting the tax administration include: a high turnover o f
personnel; a lack o f continuity in policies; an inadequate tax structure and, despite progress,
administrative inefficiencies. There is an urgent need to simplify the tax structure, which would
include a review o f bank account secrecy provisions and greater accountability; public registry
for the property tax; and a human resources policy that introduces modern management tools,
including greater emphasis o n training. Other important areas o f concern include the design o f a
cross-data system and access t o third party registration systems, such as public registries,
notaries, etc; and the need to utilize improved communication systems to better link tax
administration with Uruguayan society.
34.
Expenditure control has been key t o the fiscal stance over the last few years, with primary
expenditure falling by five percentage points o f GDP over 2002-04. Maintaining a policy o f
expenditure restraint will be at the center o f fiscal management. The n e w Government intends to
achieve this through a combination o f expenditure switching policies t o fund new initiatives and
expenditure reducing measures. Pensions are by far the largest single item o f public expenditures
in Uruguay and they account for most o f the growth in expenditures over the last ten years.
Implementing reforms to control the growth in pension spending will be a major challenge (para.
64). Public sector employment was reduced by some 10 percent between 1995 and 2002,
although there i s still room for additional efficiency improvements w h i c h could imply inter alia
further reduction in public employment over time, in particular through attrition and voluntary
retirement schemes. Changes in public employment would be linked t o broader improvements in
the civil service and public sector management (paras. 58-60). Increased private sector

15

participation could help to increase fiscal space by reducing demand on the budget from
infrastructure investment needs (paras. 49-54).

35.
The financial sector remains a potential source o f vulnerability for Uruguay and i t s
contribution to growth needs to be strengthened. The 2002 crisis was devastating for the banking
sector. Many private commercial banks collapsed, leaving the sector even more dominated by
public banks than was the case before the crisis. The two traditional public banks (BROU and
BHU) have n o w been joined by a third, the Nuevo Banco Comercial (NBC), established with
assets salvaged from several private banks driven into bankruptcy by the crisis. Public banks
now account for 60 percent o f all banking assets. The crisis revealed deep structural and
managerial weaknesses in BROU and BHU. The authorities have extended emergency
assistance to both banks which are undergoing structural reform with support from the IMF and
from the IBRD. I t i s important that these restructuring efforts continue to be diligently pursued.
The N B C complicates the picture because, with branches throughout the country, it competes
directly with BROU. The N B C (which operates under commercial law) i s currently seeking a
foreign strategic investor. However, it would better serve the long-term interests o f the banking
sector if the N B C were to be privatized. What remains o f the private banking system after the
2002 crisis i s a small network o f foreign-owned banks and a few domestic banks offering shortmaturity dollar-based products. The financial position o f these banks i s solid and many o f them
can draw upon support from large parent-banks abroad. They are well placed to take advantage
o f the vacuum l e f t by liquidated domestic banks. In particular, there i s scope for engaging more
actively in the capital markets and for extending value-added services. The Government has
recently introduced legislative reforms regarding anti-money laundering and combating the
financing o f terrorism, which now await implementation.
The principal challenge for the financial sector in Uruguay today i s to reestablish a stable
36.
and efficient system o f financial intermediation between depositors and borrowers that can
channel capital to productive investments. The problem i s not a lack o f deposits. Deposits by
residents have already surpassed the level o f July 2002 when the bank moratorium was imposed.
Nevertheless, banks, both public and private, are highly liquid. There are a number o f reasons for
that:
0

0

0

The vast majority o f deposits in the system today are sight deposits which could be
withdrawn at the slightest sign o f trouble and banks must prepare themselves for that
possibility by maintaining high levels o f liquidity and lending with short-term maturity.

Risk aversion and liquidity considerations encourage banks to lend predominantly
within the financial sector so that 61 percent o f the total loan portfolio i s between
financial institutions. Loans to the non-financial sector have decreased by almost 60
percent since December 2001, and access to credit has been squeezed, particularly for
smaller businesses.
Most deposits (90 percent as o f end-June 2004) are foreign currency denominated and,
as a result of the crisis, banks are acutely aware o f the danger o f extending foreign
currency loans to borrowers whose income i s exclusively peso-denominated. Hence
lending i s concentrated on the export sector.

16

The problems confronted by the banking sector stem in part from limited confidence, but
37.
also from structural challenges including:
a

,

a

The lack o f a significant market for peso-denominated financial products has greatly
increased the vulnerability o f the financial system to external shocks. The recent
introduction o f inflation-indexed (UI) deposits was an important step to encourage the
development o f peso-based financial services.

A recently introduced deposit insurance program remains un-funded. If the scheme i s
funded and implemented selectively to peso and UI deposits in the first instance, this
would increase confidence in the banking system as a whole and help foster a gradual
“pesification” o f the financial sector.

a

Financial sector regulation and supervision will play an important role in the recovery
and improved performance o f financial sector institutions. Independence o f the central
bank i s a goal that Uruguay may seek to attain. Short o f that, the authorities could
ensure the full technical independence o f financial sector supervisory and regulatory
activities within the Central Bank.

a

Off-shore banking merits special attention from the regulators. Given the distinct risks
embedded by on- and off-shore activities and their sensitivities to different parameters,
arrangements are needed for differentiating regulations o f on- and off-shore banking
activities in line with international experience.

38.
A broader financial sector strategy explicitly oriented to sustain growth would favor a
deepening o f financial markets and a progressive lengthening o f the maturities o f available
financial assets in order to provide financial resources to long-term investments in fixed assets by
the productive sector and to housing investments by the household sector. A strengthening o f
managed savings institutions such as l i f e insurance and pension funds- whether public or private
- would help t o create a stronger and more stable domestic demand for long-term assets that
could offer t o long-term investment a domestic source o f finance. The supply o f long-term assets
may be channeled, among other possibilities, through the banking sector by securitizing longt e r m loans to the corporate sector (for fixed investments) or t o the household sector (for
housing). A lengthening o f the maturity o f domestic currency denominated government debt
would benefit from the presence o f a more stable demand, provided that clear limits are put to
the maximum portfolio share o f investments in public assets. A stable demand for longer-term
government issues would in turn provide an important support to a more ambitious reform o f the
government bond market and o f its related segments (repos, derivatives) and would help the
development and trading o f some basic hedging tools.

B. Sustaining Growth
39.
Over the past thirty years per capita income growth averaged little more than one percent
a year. Relative to many countries, Uruguay has fallen steadily behind. Whereas, in 1980, the
per capita income o f Uruguay was about one third the level o f the United States, it is n o w less

17

than one quarter in purchasing power parity terms (Figure 9). Without sustained growth, fiscal
stability and overall improvement in living standards will not be achievable.

Figure 9: GDP Per Capita in Uruguay (PPP) as Percent o f USA

40.
Longer-run economic growth will depend upon structural and policy reforms aimed at
increasing investment and enhancing competitiveness. The Bank recently completed a
comprehensive study on sources o f growth in Uruguay which examined in detail the issues that
need to be addressed. The Sources o f Growth study contains detailed recommendations for
consolidating fiscal and financial reforms, improving the efficiency o f factor markets, fostering
integration through trade and investment, promoting competition in infrastructure and, in
general, improving the business climate for private sector development (Annex 3). Even with
stronger growth, however, it will take many years for Uruguay to catch up with the metropolitan
countries o f Europe and North America. Table 3 illustrates the size o f the task using Spain as a
comparator country. Were Uruguay to grow at 4 percent a year, it would take a minimum o f 26
years to catch up with Spain and, if Spain itself were to grow at a modest 2 percent, it would take
Uruguay fully half a century to catch up.

Trade. MERCOSUR has been the most important vehicle o f trade policy for Uruguay for
many years past. The recent economic crisis has revealed weaknesses in the structure and the
share o f Uruguay’s merchandise exports to its MERCOSUR partners f e l l from 55 percent in
1998 to an estimated 24 percent in 2004. The decline was exacerbated by the imposition o f
significant non-tariff barriers by Argentina and Brazil in an effort to protect their own domestic
producers.
42.
MERCOSUR could best harness i t s potential for trade expansion by providing a context
for member countries to j o i n forces and gain more leverage in trade negotiations with industrial
countries which favor high agricultural protection. While striving to mobilize MERCOSUR to
the fullest extent possible, Uruguay should also pursue bilateral trade agreements with other
countries wherever these hold a potential for trade gains. The bilateral agreement concluded
with Mexico has led to an acceleration o f trade and it illustrates well how such agreements can
be advantageous for Uruguay. A free trade agreement with the USA, and by extension the
proposed FTAA, could bring substantial gains for Uruguay and other MERCOSUR countries.
Similar gains could come from a free trade agreement with the European Union. Agreements
with the USA and/or European Union can be beneficial even if they fall short o f a final-best
arrangement that dismantles all programs o f domestic assistance and export subsidies in the USA
and the EU. Trade agreements with industrial countries would also entail intangible advantages
in terms o f investment, quality and variety, standard and regulation.

43.
Agriculture, natural resources and environment. Agriculture has been the principal source o f
growth for Uruguay in the past and the sector possesses considerable potential for further
growth. The agriculture and agro-industry sectors represent approximately 23 percent o f
Uruguay’s GDP; over half o f agricultural output i s exported and accounts for more than 60
percent o f Uruguay’s total export earnings. The currency devaluation o f 2002 increased the
competitiveness of Uruguayan agriculture in world markets. This i s a temporary boost, however,
and longer-term competitiveness will hinge on fundamental structural changes. A stronger, more

19

competitive agriculture can be built on three main pillars: (i)
the development and dissemination
o f new technologies, (ii)
improved product quality based upon good production and processing
practices and food safety and (iii)
the establishment o f a new institutional structure to enhance
competitiveness.

44.
Food safety i s a major concern for the agricultural sector. It i s estimated that losses from
the recent foot and mouth disease epidemic amounted to US$730 million during 2001-03, or
almost 2 percent o f GDP annually. To avert a repetition o f the crisis, concrete measures should
be developed together with all neighboring countries to guarantee food safety and avoid further
disease outbreaks in the livestock population.
45.
The longer-term success o f agriculture in Uruguay w i l l depend critically upon conserving
the natural resource endowment. Advances already made in stemming erosion, soil degradation
and cultivating vulnerable land should continue to be pursued. In particular, increased livestock
production will depend upon the improved management o f natural pastures, and increased
agricultural production will require stronger water resource management. As more and newer
irrigation investments are made and generate more pressure on limited resources, the need for an
improved water resources policy and regulatory framework will increase.
46.
The substantial potential for forestry development in Uruguay i s widely acknowledged
and major foreign direct investments are currently being undertaken. New forest plantations
have been located in “priority areas” which are relatively unsuitable for other agriculture. As
these activities expand, it will be important to assess further the environmental sustainability o f
commercial forestry, especially with respect to surface water, soils and biodiversity. Sustainable
industrial processing o f forestry products calls for careful environmental assessment o f proposed
new investments, as well as ongoing pollution monitoring and control.

47.

The above pillars could help to improve living conditions in the rural areas where poverty
i s relatively higher than in the urban areas. In 2000, the poverty rate in rural towns was 27
percent, a full ten percentage points higher than in urban areas. However, given the low labor
intensity o f many agricultural product lines, the agriculture sector alone i s not sufficient to
generate adequate productive employment to lift the rural poor out o f poverty. Without growth in
rural non-farm alternatives, rural wages are likely to remain low - i.e., often at or below the
poverty line. In order to support growth in non-farm employment, particularly in the small rural
towns, additional targeting o f educational and productive services will be needed.
Pollution i s a manageable challenge that can be kept under control through effective
preventive measures. National environmental challenges include urban degradation (especially
solid waste management and urban air pollution); coastal contamination (both in the degrading
international waters o f the Rio Plata and the Atlantic coast with i t s strong coastal tourism
industry); and industrial pollution (including major new investments in industrial processing o f
forest products). The institutional and legal framework i s considered to need improvement and
this i s on the l i s t for action under the new Government.

48.

49.
Infrastructure and public services. In terms o f coverage and quality, the provision o f
infrastructure and public services in Uruguay i s good when compared with other Latin American
countries and middle-income countries in other regions. However, there are shortcomings with

20

respect to efficiency and, as a consequence, some services are relatively expensive compared to
other countries in the region. This i s particularly the case for water and hydrocarbons and, to a
lesser extent, other energy sources. Inefficiencies in infrastructure and public services affect
Uruguay’s competitiveness and impact consumer welfare.
50.
The transport sector i s a good example where reforms have improved efficiency and
quality. Uruguay boasts a relatively efficient road sector and an improving port sector. The
primary road network is in better condition than in any other country in the region. Overall, the
number o f containers has increased by 160 percent since 1993, the year after port sector reform,
and the absolute cost o f moving a container is similar to that o f other ports under concession in
the region. The improving competitiveness o f transport services i s associated with progress
achieved in sector reform which i s still on-going and needs to be consolidated. The reform has
identified institutional responsibilities within the Government for policy formulation, planning,
and regulation o f the sector and gradually introduced private-sector participation in varying
forms into construction and maintenance operations. The increased private sector participation
has helped improve management practices in both public and private sector, and generated
additional investment.
51.
The utilities and public services are almost exclusively in the hands o f the public sector,
and policy definition, regulation and operations are generally merged in the sector agencies and
public enterprises. The efficiency shortcomings o f the utilities sectors relative to the transport
sector suggest that a significant margin for improvement exists. The experience o f the transport
sector shows that efficiency gains can be achieved through a combination o f distinguishing the
three separate functions o f policy definition, regulation and operations o n the one hand and
promoting private participation o n the other. In the utilities, progress has been made in separating
these functions, but more can be done.
52.
The redefinition and strengthening o f the policy function at the ministry level i s an
essential challenge, together with strengthening the legal and regulatory framework. In practice,
the utilities continue t o play a central role in defining tariffs which are then confirmed by the
Government o n the basis o f fiscal rather than efficiency criteria. The responsible ministries lack
strong policymaking units and there i s an absence o f publicly available analysis to support key
government decisions. In the absence o f strong policy leadership at the ministry level, public
utility operators have frequently taken upon themselves policy issues by default.
53.
Presently, sector laws exist in Uruguay only for power and communications. Sector laws
for natural gas and for water supply and sanitation have been submitted to Congress but have yet
to be approved. The need for a such a l a w i s especially pressing in the case o f water supply and
sanitation where the institutional framework is particularly complex. In the case o f petroleum
products, a sector l a w was enacted but subsequently annulled following a referendum, leaving a
legislative void to be filled. Regulatory bodies have been established for power, natural gas,
petroleum products, water supply and sanitation (URSEA), telecommunications and postal
services (URSEC). However, these bodies are not yet sufficiently w e l l staffed and equipped and,
in some cases, their mandate i s not yet sufficiently well defined for them to discharge their
functions properly. Early action to complete the legal frameworks in k e y sectors would set the
stage for further improvements in efficiency, service quality and private investment. In the
energy sector, for example, promotion o f private investment could be achieved through

21

public/private partnerships for expansion o f power generation and transmission capacity.
Another option for consideration would be to open the capital o f state companies.
Infrastructure and public service sub-sectors all have their own individual challenges over
and beyond the cross-cutting issues o f regulation, governance and private sector participation.

54.

The challenges faced in the transport sector focus on completing and consolidating the
sector reforms, particularly in the ports and railway sectors, but also in attaining higher
levels o f investment in order to: (i)
ensure stable functionality and good condition o f
major transport infrastructure linking producers to markets for agricultural, livestock and
forestry production; and (ii)
arrest further deterioration o f infrastructure resulting from
the maintenance backlog as a result o f the economic crisis.

The challenges in energy include; (i)adopting import parity prices for fuels; (ii)
introducing yardstick competition or other incentives to increase supply efficiency; (iii)
developing programs for reducing energy losses and increasing end-use efficiency; (iv)
improving energy interconnections with Argentina and Brazil to tap their wholesale
markets through long-term supply contracts; and (v) establishing an operational
wholesale energy market (ADME).
In addition to the need for yardstick competition and programs to reduce unaccounted-for
water, the water supply and sanitation sector faces the challenge o f achieving universal
coverage. Only a very small percentage o f the population lacks potable water (about 2
percent), but a large share o f the population (35 percent by some measures) lacks
household sewerage connections and sewerage treatment services. Universal coverage o f
water supply and sanitation services i s a key factor for improving living standards in line
with the Millennium Development Goals.

55.
Enabling environment for the private sector. In order to create a more conducive
environment for the private sector, the Government faces challenges in three areas: (i)
creating
public-private partnerships; (ii)
improving the legal framework for firm entry and exit; and (iii)
fostering innovation. The Government sees the instrument o f public-private partnerships as a
“transversal” arrangement that may serve many public sectors in order to enhance efficiency and
mobilize much needed additional (private) resources without resorting to (repeatedly rejected)
privatization schemes. Specifically, Uruguay could benefit from public-private partnerships in
sharing the risks involved in innovation systems, and in the development o f adaptation
technology, the formation o f a market-information based culture, as well as change management
and communication strategy.

56.

One o f the most serious problems affecting competition stems from regulations which
limit the mobility of firms in the Uruguayan market. This i s partially due to the legal framework
on bankruptcy and receivership which i s in need o f modernization as it promotes negative
incentives and increased costs due to time lags and ambiguous results from bankruptcy
proceedings. SMEs rarely obtain bankruptcy insurance due to high costs and a lack o f
accounting records which are required by regulation in order to f i l e a petition for bankruptcy,
thereby failing to take advantage o f this important protection. A more comprehensive legal and
judicial framework for declaring bankruptcy in Uruguay could be an important step for private

22

sector development. To be effective, it would be important to accompany this with adequate
capacity-building for the specialized bankruptcy courts and administrative agencies that have
jurisdiction in this area.

57.
Despite recent advancements, SME development and innovation policy need further
strengthening. The system i s characterized by a number o f specific innovation and SME support
programs which lack a strategic vision and adequate coordination among the different
implementing institutims. This results in fragmentation, as well as duplication o f efforts and
resources. Recently some actions have been taken, such as the establishment o f an SME network,
with encouraging results. These measures provide greater strategic and operational consistency
to the National Innovation Strategy and they help the planning, funding an execution o f
programs. To further promote innovation and to facilitate the implementation o f the National
Innovation Strategy, it i s also important to promote linkages between research and business, and
more generally between the public and private sector.
58.

State modernization. The new administration recognizes that a broad-based
reorganization o f the public sector i s required to realize its vision o f a strategic government role
in economic management. Key challenges include clarifying institutional responsibilitiesincluding the functions of policy, regulation and operation discussed above, preempting potential
conflicts o f interest, enhancing transparency, strengthening accountability, and increasing
operational efficiency. The scope o f the challenge i s enormous and success will depend not only
on political will, but also on a well designed strategy that takes advantage o f the window o f
opportunity facing the new Government. Priority action areas encompass tax administration, the
regulatory reform agenda, management o f state companies, as well as streamlining public
services to respond more effectively to the needs o f the population and offer an enabling
environment for the private sector. Decentralization i s a potentially important means to enhance
the efficiency o f the state and increasing civil society participation in public management. The
new Government has identified the need for a single citizen registration process which will serve
multiple purposes, including improving the efficiency o f payroll control, subsidy and other social
policies, public utilities, tax administration, electoral processes and property rights registration.

59.
Modernization of the state has a central role in efficient public expenditure management.
While Uruguay has previously pursued a system o f performance management in the public
sector, specific targets and indicators reflecting efficiency and quality should be made public on
a regular basis so that performance can be adequately evaluated. Policies to increase the

professionalism o f Uruguay’s civil service could include linking performance evaluation, bonus
and promotion to the achievement o f targets. Full implementation o f projects involving state
purchasing and other procurement reforms would lead to greater transparency and increased
competition among suppliers as well as a more efficient procurement process, particularly within
Uruguay’s Central Administration.
Bringing the SICE (Sistema Integrado de Compras
Estatales) into broader use within the public administration would allow for compliance with the
procedural rules and ensure that payments by the State are recognized for purchasing. I t would
also permit a more wide-ranging control over calls for bids, an aspect that i s currently difficult to
control in Uruguay. Finally, it will be important to expand and strengthen substantially the
country’s public expenditure monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems. The Government i s
well aware o f the potential o f a well-designed, carefully managed M&E system in supporting the
creation o f fiscal space and re-composition o f public expenditure in line with i t s priorities.

23

60.

A key challenge for the Government i s to improve efficiency in the administration o f
state-owned companies, and the quality o f their goods and services, by promoting a more
competitive environment in corresponding markets. This involves redesigning the institutional
framework, while aiming to define proper governance structures. It i s important that state
companies function as efficient enterprises acting under market conditions. Profit alone is not an
adequate indicator o f efficiency, since the rigidity o f demand and the small number o f actors
(when there is more than one) allow pass through o f inefficiencies to prices. Governing boards
facing clear incentives linked to the achievement o f qualitative and quantitative goals can
promote efficiency. An institutional framework that provides working mechanisms o f public
oversight o f performance, both at the market and political level, can underpin the drive for more
efficient state companies.
C. Improving Living Standards

61.
While Uruguay dedicates a large portion o f i t s income to the social sectors, the bulk o f
the expenditures are concentrated in public pensions and health. High levels o f expenditures in
these two areas are largely driven by the demographic o f an aging population. The level o f public

expenditure in other social services is similar or lower than the norm for Latin American
countries (such as in the case o f education). Overall, the distribution o f social expenditures in
Uruguay no longer favors human capital formation t o the extent needed t o compete globally,
This situation needs t o be addressed in the years ahead, and the new administration faces the
challenge o f bringing the escalating costs o f public pensions and health care under control, in
order to free up fiscal space for other essential social investments including an expanded social
safety net.
Box 3: Who i s Vulnerable in Uruguay?

While poverty and other social indicators in Uruguay are better than in much o f Latin America,
social conditions deteriorated substantially during the recession and crisis. Many categories saw increases
o f up to 100 percent, with unemployment increasing from 10 to 17 percent between 1998 and 2003, while
poverty spiked from 17 to 31 percent and extreme poverty doubled to 2.8 percent over 2000-03.
The 2003 Poverty Update (Report No. 26223-UR) provides useful insight into who in Uruguay
was most vulnerable to the damaging effects of the crisis, and suggests where interventions to address the
causes o f the vulnerability can be most effective. The Poverty Update provides a breakdown o f vulnerable
groups into gender, spatial and minority. In general, those households in which the head i s unemployed,
employed in the informal sector or self-employed, Le., not having social security benefits, were more
likely to be poor. Crowded households, households headed by young men, workers in sectors sensitive to
economic downturns such as construction, or individuals with low educational attainment were also
particularly vulnerable. The young are overrepresented among the poor, and this situation has worsened
during the recession.
Finally, although small in absolute number, rural poverty rates exceed those o f major urban areas,
and non-agricultural wage-earners living in small towns are more likely to be poor than farmers and farm
in the more dispersed areas. In 2000, the poverty headcount was 25.0 percent for small settlements of
900-5000 inhabitants, 28.2 percent for villages with less than 900 inhabitants, and 19.5 percent for
dispersed rural areas; while the urban poverty headcount was 17.2 percent. More recent rural poverty data
i s not available. The relative high incidence o f rural poverty i s especially significant as over 40 percent of
the rural Door are children, many o f whom have left school and entered the labor market at a young age.

24

62.

Social protection and poverty alleviation. While total spending o n social protection
(including both social insurance and social assistance expenditures) in Uruguay is high compared
to the Region and even the OECD countries, the system i s dominated by public pensions which
have absorbed the equivalent o f 18 percent o f GDP o n average during the past 5 years. There i s
ample evidence that the high cost o f public pensions has crowded out public expenditures o n
other much needed programs o f social protection such as unemployment benefits and transfers in
kind and in cash to the poor. As a result, the coverage o f these other programs i s uneven and
many urgent social needs remain unattended. Food transfer programs were called upon to
expand their activities by as much as one third in the wake o f the economic crisis. W h i l e it
appears that these programs are well targeted towards the poor, it i s not clear whether they are as
effective as cash transfer programs in combating poverty.

63.

Similarly, the recent economic crisis revealed serious shortcomings in the provision o f
unemployment benefit which is currently available only to workers who have contributed
insurance premiums to the Banco de Previsidn Social (BPS) during the 12 month period prior t o
j o b loss. Many workers do not contribute to the BPS so that, at the height o f the crisis in 1999,
unemployment benefits were provided to only 17 percent o f the unemployed. The serious
poverty impact of the crisis points to the need for a more effective structure o f income protection
for the unemployed.
Public pensions. As mentioned above, public pensions currently crowd out other
important human development investments. In concert with efforts to strengthen contribution
enforcement, several measures could help bring the escalating cost o f public pensions under
control. First, there could be a closer link between the retirement age and increases in longevity.
Second, consideration could be given to restructuring the relationship between retirement age
and the replacement rate o f pensions so as to reduce the financial pressure o n the system. Third,
a phased introduction o f a different indexing scheme -which would protect the real value o f
pensions also in times of crisis - could be considered. The present practice o f indexing pensions
to wages (set under the Constitution), together with a progressively aging population, poses
important constraints o n containing the cost o f the pension system. In other countries, a shift
from pure wage towards an index based o n a mixture o f prices and wages has yielded substantial
savings. Pension reforms would help in promoting economic efficiency and faster growth, while
making the social protection system more responsive to the objectives o f equity and poverty
reduction.

64.

65.
Health. Notwithstanding recent improvements in several important health institutions in
the country (including the Ministry o f Health and the Fondo Nacional de Recursos, universal
insurance for high complexity interventions), Uruguay faces a number o f serious challenges in
the health sector. There is an urgent need t o contain the heavy financial cost o f health care
which continues to increase year by year and which threatens t o become unsustainable. Uruguay
invests about 11 percent o f its GDP o n health care, one o f the highest ratios in the world. The
high level o f health expenditures i s due t o a constellation o f factors including: technological
change, an unduly complex institutional structure with overlapping responsibilities and
inadequate incentives for efficiency, a highly regulated physician labor market that undermines
the ability o f health organizations to control their personal costs, and a delivery system that is not
well matched to the health needs o f the population. The fragmentation o f the system not only
results in high costs but also undermines the quality o f care.

25

66.
The main financial problems o f the health sector are manifested in the long-term financial
crisis o f the I A M C s (Collective Mutual Care Institutions). Most o f the I A M C s - especially those
o f Montevideo - have had steadily increasing levels o f long-term debt and seven (15 percent o f
total) have gone bankrupt since 1999. The recent economic crisis added t o the financial woes o f
the IAMCs, and revealed even more the institutional problems. Those include weaknesses o f
management, together with the functioning o f a complicated physicians labor market and a
regulatory framework that does not promote price competition or efficiency.
67.

The new Government wants to work towards a harmonized system that will ensure a
more equitable access to services, and improved quality o f care and increased financial
protection, while reducing the financial burden o n the system. The Government intends to define
i t s strategy towards a harmonized system through a consultative process.

68.
Education. In terms o f outcomes, Uruguay’s education system stands out in Latin
America, but compares less favorably with OECD countries (Table 4). A s o f 2003, 95 percent o f
primary school age Uruguayan children were enrolled and nearly a l l remained in school to
complete the full primary cycle. Enrollment in secondary and tertiary education has also
increased, though at more moderate rates. National student assessment results indicate
substantial improvements in achievement between 1996 and 2002.

Despite progress, the education system is facing challenges that need t o be addressed.
First, overall spending in education continues to be low. At 3.6 percent o f GDP (2003), Uruguay
invests considerably less o n education than the average Latin American country (and even more
so as compared to the O E C D average). Second, although Uruguay’s focus o n full-time schools
has been generally acclaimed to have reduced inequities, such inequities persist and their
reduction i s at the top o f the agenda o f the new administration. Inequities in learning outcomes
between children o f different socio-economic background continue to be high and manifest

26

themselves in unequal pre-school attendance. In-depthanalysis to determine the degree to which
the current system of teacher and student assignments contributes to maintain inequities in the
system would help prioritize appropriate policy measures. Third, the quality and relevance o f
secondary and technical schools could be improved. About half o f those who enter secondary
and technical education drop out before completion, with such drop-outs disproportionately
representing students from poorer families. Fourth, the public university system displays similar
challenges as in many countries, such as a considerable discrepancy between planned and actual
length o f matriculation and a bias in access towards students from higher income families.
University reform, including introducing incentives for students to finish their studies on time,
and reduction o f the secondary school drop-out rate are key priorities for the country to improve
i t s competitive edge in a globalized world economy. Lastly, administration o f the education
system could benefit from modernization and efficiency improvements. This would entail, inter
alia, a streamlining o f ANEP, the autonomous institution which currently leads the country’s
education system. The brain drain o f educated youth from Uruguay poses an additional challenge
to human capital formation, as according to the most recent estimates (2002) about 12 percent o f
the country’s professionals and technicians have migrated to other countries.

Social inclusion, gender and civil society. While Uruguay i s considered an homogeneous
70.
society compared to other countries in the region, and has the most equal income distribution in
South America, i t has experienced a deepening o f social exclusion during the last crisis, e.g. for
Afro-descendents, youth, women and the rural poor. Uruguay has the largest Afro-descendents
population in the Southern Cone. This group has historically experienced above-average poverty
and unemployment rates, lower wages, and educational attainment rates that are consistently
below the average for the general population. In the case o f Uruguayan youth, those between the
ages o f 15 and 24 account for only 16 percent of the total population but 46 percent o f total
unemployment. O f the unemployed youth, only 2 percent receive some sort o f training and only
4 percent obtain unemployment insurance. H a l f o f the unemployed youth in Uruguay did not
finish secondary school and are unprepared for skilledjobs, while those who are unemployed are
frequently employed in unstable and precarious jobs, with scarce possibilities o f social mobility.
As risk factors increase for youth, including lack of opportunities for gainful employment, the
attractiveness o f alternative methods for gaining welfare through crime and violence increases,
as does the incidence o f drug and alcohol consumption, with consequent costs for society. The
new Government i s committed to addressing the problems associated with society’s most
vulnerable groups, and has created a new Ministry o f Social Development in which to focus i t s
efforts. This young Ministry will need support in facing this broad set o f challenges.

Despite Uruguay’s reputation as a socially progressive society, recent research indicates
71.
that women continue to suffer from discrimination. The male-female wage gap, and labor
participation gap closed significantly between 1990 and 2000, but there was no progress
thereafter. There i s a persistent wage differential o f approximately 14 percent between male and
female wages for similar work overall, and higher s t i l l for men and women with higher levels o f
education. Further, fewer women than men receive unemployment insurance, independently o f
the level o f education. Clearly, more proactive labor market policies and intermediation services
to foster a non-discriminatory labor market would help addressing this issue. In addition,
domestic violence remains a serious problem in Uruguay, as a recent survey found that 46
percent o f women married or living with a partner suffered from domestic violence in the
previous year. Although considerable progress has been made in terms o f legislation to address

27

domestic violence, more remains to be done particularly in terms o f improving access to justice
for the most vulnerable groups.

72.
Millennium Development Goals. Uruguay has made major progress towards reaching the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). As indicated in Annex 4, Uruguay i s making good
strides towards attaining the goals related to education, gender, child and maternal mortality
rates, especially in view o f the crisis which the country has undergone in the recent years. The
goal to reach the poverty reduction target, formulated as reducing by half the percentage o f the
population living on less than U S $ l per day, suffered a set-back during the crisis years in line
with the large increase in the official poverty rate. Although poverty i s expected to decline with
continued economic growth, it i s likely to take years o f sustained growth and improved social
policies to bring poverty down to pre-crisis levels and below. Finally, the MDG related to
environmental sustainability shows good progress for water, but somewhat less so for sanitation.
More than one third o f urban households s t i l l lack proper sanitation services, and this rate would
have to be reduced to about one fifth by 2015 to meet the target.

V. MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK
73.
The macroeconomic framework projected for Uruguay under the base case envisages
steady state GDP growth o f 3 percent in the medium term. This projection assumes: (i)
continued macroeconomic stability and improved creditworthiness underpinned by strong fiscal
performance and reduced financial sector vulnerability, and (ii)higher investment and
productivity underpinned by broad-based improvements in the investment climate. Sustained
progress on the structural reform agenda to address the development challenges facing Uruguay
i s assumed to contribute to the strong fiscal fundamentals and improved investment climate
supporting the base case scenario. The investment to GDP ratio i s projected to rise steadily
towards 18 percent, some 2-3 percentage points above historical levels. The projected 3 percent
growth rate i s higher than the historical average o f 2.0 percent (1965-2004), but not
unprecedented in Uruguay. For example, the economy recorded average growth o f 4.4 percent
during 1991-97, that is, the period prior to the recession and the crisis.
74.
Strong fiscal performance i s critical to realizing higher levels o f growth. Sustaining a
primary surplus at or above the 3.8 percent o f GDP recorded in 2004 i s an achievable challenge
for Uruguay. A sustained primary surplus o f this order i s an important factor to generating a
“virtuous circle” whereby improving public creditworthiness lowers vulnerability and supports
macroeconomic stability which in turn promotes economic growth which then contributes to
fiscal performance and a falling public debt to GDP ratio. The Government’s program includes
reforms to strengthen revenues (such as a new personal income tax, reducing evasion in social
security contributions, increases in the VAT base, elimination o f low yield distortionary taxes)
and also a commitment to keep expenditures under control.

Price stability i s another important element o f the projected macroeconomic framework.
Keeping inflation under control can be important to avoid a spiral o f inflation and wage increases
that could jeopardize fiscal performance and undermine the investment climate. The base case
scenario assumes that inflation remains low under continued tight macroeconomic policies and
gradually converges to international levels, that is, to 3.5 percent per year starting in 2007.
Consumer inflation i s projected at 5 percent in 2005-06. The real exchange rate (RER) i s
projected to move on a modestly appreciating trend through 2007 and then remain constant
thereafter, thereby stabilizing in an intermediate range betweenthe depreciated level o f the 1980s
and the more appreciated level o f the 1990s.
76.
Reforms in the financial sector that are underway are a core element in the’growth
strategy. These reforms aim to reduce financial sector vulnerability and improve financial
intermediation. The new Government has committed to continue the reform process. Key
priorities include: (i)strengthened bank supervision with greater efforts to comply with
international standards and greater independence from possible political interference; (ii)
upgraded prudential regulation to manage risks arising from non-resident deposits and currency
mis-matches; (iii)improved bank exit procedures; and (iv) continuation o f the state bank
restructuring program including measures to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and improve
corporate management.
77.
Other reforms incorporated into the base case projections include measures to improve
the business climate such as simplification o f procedures and regulations for new businesses,
improvement o f commercial justice procedures, measures to promote research and development
in small and medium enterprises and to facilitate their access to international markets. The base
case scenario i s also predicated on steady progress to reduce costs o f public services and
maintain Uruguay’s infrastructure. This encompasses improvements in regulation and measures
to improve efficiency in their utilization. The scenario further envisages a comprehensive
program o f social policies (including health, education, social protection) to enhance Uruguay’s
human capital and promote social inclusion.
Under the base case macroeconomic framework, public sector creditworthiness indicators
78.
are projected to improve steadily over time. Public debt as a share o f GDP i s projected to decline
gradually from an estimated 92 percent as o f end-2004 to about 60 percent by 2010 (Table 6).
Debt service as a share of total government revenues i s also projected to decline over time after a
peak in 2006 o f 49 percent, to about 35 percent by 2010. Multilateral debt service i s projected to
decline as a share o f total debt service, from about 50 percent in 2005 to about 44 percent in
2010. A strong policy framework, supported by the IFIs, and projected improvement in
creditworthiness are expected to enhance Uruguay’s access to financial markets at reasonable
spreads. It i s assumed that spreads remain at 400 basis points over the medium term. This spread
i s at the level observed in March 2005.

The public sector financing plan under the base case i s predicated on issuance o f about
US$450 million in bonds per year on average. Table 7 shows gross financing needs (interest plus
amortization obligations) estimated for the coming years. Interest payments are estimated to
remain at about US$0.7 billion per year through 2005-10. Amortization payments are estimated
at about US$1.2 billion per year, except during 2006 and 2007, with amortization peaks o f
US$1.7 and US$1.4 billion, respectively. These peaks are associated with repayments to the IMF
o f US$0.7 and US$0.9 billion, and also to maturing bonds in 2006 o f US$0.6 billion.

Sensitivity analysis (Annex 2) shows that limited deviations from the base case scenario
are unlikely t o reverse the downward projected public debt path, but that larger slippages in
performance could increase vulnerability significantly. For example, a primary surplus o f 3
percent o f GDP, with a l l other base case assumptions unchanged, would result in a projected
debt to GDP ratio o f 67 percent in 2010, 7 percentage points higher than the 60 percent projected
under the base case but still a significant decline from current levels. If, o n the other hand,
medium-term growth were t o converge to the historical average o f 2 percent, then the projected
debt ratio in 2010 would be 64 percent. This implies a certain cushion with regard to the base
case in terms o f debt sustainability. However, the margin for error i s limited and the risks
increase commensurately with the extent o f the deviations. If, for example, fiscal performance
and growth were to slip simultaneously, leading to downward pressure o n the exchange rate and
higher risk premiums o n sovereign debt, then Uruguay’s creditworthiness would remain quite
vulnerable to shocks. The combination o f 2 percent GDP growth, 3 percent primary surplus, no
real exchange rate appreciation and higher interest rates would result in a projected medium-term
public debt ratio in the range o f 84 percent in 2010.

VI. THE BANK’S ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
A. CAS Objectives
81.
The Bank Group’s assistance over the period covered by the CAS (FY05-10) proposes a
strategic program o f lending and non-lending services to support the main objective o f the new
administration’s development plan “El Gobierno de Cambio - L a Transicibn Responsable ”,
which i s the attainment o f equitable and sustainable economic development. To attain this
longer-term goal, the Government needs to meet challenges in three broad areas:
0
0
0

reducing vulnerability;
sustaining growth; and
improving living standards.

82.
The proposed Bank program responds to specific requests for support made by the new
administration to help address some o f the key aspects o f the broad development challenges
facing Uruguay. Requests for Bank support include tax reform, as well as financial sector and
capital markets development, mainly through technical assistance and development policy
lending; the health sector, where Uruguay needs assistance in reforming the national health
system, mainly though an investment operation; education, where the Government i s looking for
continued support to expand full-time schools in marginal areas as well as management reforms
in the education administration; in the area of innovation, where mainly technical assistance i s
required to reform the existing institutional set up and to design a national system o f innovation
which would provide the basis for generating the required decision making capacity in the
country; the infrastructure andpublic services sector, both in the form o f technical assistance to
revise the current institutional set up as well as investment in the areas o f transport, energy and
water supply and sanitation, with a view to strengthen regulation and promote private sector
participation; in agriculture and natural resources management, mainly through investment to
promote the use o f integrated systems for natural resources management which are viable both
from the environmental as well as the economic standpoint, and which should provide a basis for
the improvement of competitiveness in agricultural productivity; state modernization, with a
view to redefining the role o f the state in order to enhance transparency, strengthen
accountability and increase i t s operations efficiency. In the area o f private sector development,
the Government seeks assistance in defining the role o f state financial institutions in the
development o f capital markets, as well as the development o f a business environment which i s
in line with the country’s current requirements for productive investment. In the context o f the
proposed technical assistance in this area, the Government i s also seeking Bank support for
conducting studies on the needed improvements in bankruptcy mechanisms.

An overarching goal o f the Bank’s program i s to support the Government’s objective to
83.
support institutional
increase social inclusion and reduce inequality. To this end, we will: (i)
strengthening for social inclusion, particularly the newly established Ministry o f Social
Development, the Institute o f Women’s Affairs (IWA) and by creating mechanisms for N G O
outreach; (ii)
strengthen the analytical underpinning by building upon previous analytical work,
such as the recently completed study on social tariffs, and through regular poverty monitoring,
inequality monitoring, and social analysis; and (iii)
mainstream social inclusion and stakeholders
analysis into project design and implementation. Finally, we will mainstream throughout various
33

thematic interventions mentioned above the commitment to strengthen outreach to civil society
to better engage stakeholders in the various reform and governance initiatives that will both
require public support and invite public accountability in order to be successful. With regard to
reducing inequality, tax reform may prove to be an important instrument. The new Government
plans to re-introduce a personal income tax from all sources - currently only wages and pensions
,are taxed. Depending o n deductions and exemptions, progressivity o f tax rates and effective
compliance, the new tax has the potential o f improving equity through taxation. This may be
supported through the DPLs. In addition, the Government i s interested in reducing inequality in
education and has asked the Bank for analytical support.
In selecting specific areas to be supported, the Bank drew upon:

The outcome o f an extensive CAS consultations process, which included a
dissemination seminar for the Sources o f Growth report, a seminar to discuss the Policy
Notes, several technical missions to review sectoral issues, the preparation o f a client
survey (Box 4, Annex 5 and Section B), and consultations with civil society.
The findings o f core analytical work undertaken in recent years, especially the Poverty
Update (FY04), the Sources o f Growth (FY05) and the Policy Notes (FYOS), which
were discussed extensively with the previous Government and the new administration
and which informed the consultation process.

Box 4: Findings of the Client Survey

T o better understand the overall situation in Uruguay and h o w the Bank is
perceived by its key interlocutors and other stakeholders, the Bank commissioned a
comprehensive client survey o f key actors and opinion makers from across the spectrum
o f government, private sector, c i v i l society and academia. The Survey was conducted in
June and July 2004. A total o f 256 people were asked to respond to the survey, o f which
205, or 80 percent, participated.
I t i s important to note two aspects o f the respondent group. First, respondents had
a good understanding o f the Bank, with more than half indicating that they have been
involved with or a close observer o f World Bank activities for more than three years.
Second, with respect to h o w respondents viewed events in Uruguay, more than 60
percent registered optimism about the direction in which the country was headed.

Salient findings emerged from the survey. The first relates to the country’s
participation in the multilateral financial community. Some 97 percent indicated that the
country should receive at the least same as or more assistance from external sources to
address key challenges-with more than 50 percent indicating that more was needed.

With respect to the Bank in particular, the findings provided extremely useful
information. First, nearly three-quarters o f respondents indicated that the World Bank
should be “more involved in Uruguay’s development strategies” with only 1 percent o f
all respondents calling for less involvement. In terms o f where the Bank could make the
greatest contribution, the strongest responses centered around supporting economic
growth, and helping to reduce poverty. From the Bank’s perspective, o f course, these are
encouraging responses. At the same time, however, the data indicate a clear challenge.
The Bank was seen as more effective in areas considered important but o f relatively less
urgency (basic services and infrastructure, governance) than in the areas o f poverty
reduction and social protection where the Bank’s involvement i s considered by
respondents to be most critical. Perhaps this should not be surprising given the
complexity of poverty reduction in normal times, let alone when the impact o f severe
crisis i s s t i l l evident and far reaching. Nevertheless, it provides a useful guide for the
Bank as it seeks to move forward in transforming its support from crisis response to long
term development.

35

B. CAS Preparation Process and Lessons Learned

85.
Several activities, engaging both the previous and the new administration in an active
dialogue with the Bank, preceded the preparation o f the CAS and formed the basis for i t s
recommendations and proposed program.

86.
Consultations. In late 2004 several participatory workshops were held for the
preparation o f the Sources o f Growth report. In early December 2004, these events were
followed by a workshop in Montevideo where the Bank presented the findings o f the Sources o f
Growth report to representatives o f both the outgoing and the new administration. The workshop
was hosted by the Central Bank Governor and included participation and comments by both the
previous and the current Ministers o f Finance. This event was followed by a two-day seminar in
late January 2005 to discuss the findings o f the Policy Notes4 with the new Cabinet. The seminar
was highly participatory, and included several sessions dedicated to specific sectoral issues. The
outcome o f the Policy Notes seminar was instrumental in establishing a close dialogue with the
new authorities on key aspects o f the new Government’s program and in defining the framework
for ensuing Bank support. In addition, over the last couple o f months, a number o f technical
missions visited Montevideo to assist the Government in better defining sectoral priorities and
the needed actions for reforms in key areas o f the economy. In close cooperation with the
authorities, the Bank intends to ensure that the preparation o f new operations, including the
proposed DPLs, i s based on a participatory and consultative process.

Box 5: CAS Consultations with Civil Society
An important round o f CAS consultations was organized by the Bank in partnership with
the Government o f Uruguay, Foro Consultivo Econdmico Social del MERCOSUR, Seccidn
Uruguuya (FCES). H a l f day-long meetings were held on April 19-21, 2005 in three areas o f the
country with different characteristics: Montevideo, Paysandh and Tacuaremb6 (Annex 8).
Participants: All meetings attracted a high number o f participants (more than 200 in
total), with broad participation from the entire spectrum o f c i v i l society, including NGOs and
representatives from unions, faith groups, academia, workers’ organizations, producers’
associations, media and Government official at the national, departmental and local level.
Meetings’ Organization: All meetings were structured around a presentation on the role
of the Bank and the main objectives o f the CAS being discussed with the authorities. Following
the presentation, participants were divided into break-up working groups with a broad
representation from various segments o f civil society, and headed by a group leader, who reported
the findings o f each group in a plenary session.
Main Themes: There was a high level o f coincidence between the challenges facing
Uruguay which were identified in the CAS and those being singled out by the break-up groups.
M a i n themes that emerged from the discussion were the need to deal with fiscal constraints and to
strengthen the public sector. Participants emphasized the cost o f the crisis in terms o f loss of
employment, particularly for women, youth and other vulnerable groups, and noted that the crisis
had a severely negative impact on the country’s values, both at the family and at the individual
level.
Perceptions of the World Bank: Overall, participants had very limited information about
the role o f the Bank in the past. To this end, participants welcomed the forthcoming opening o f a
Bank’s resident mission in Montevideo. A number o f perceptions about the Bank emerged
forcefully throughout the consultations with civil society representatives, including a concern
with the impact o f the Bank’s assistance. However, there was a very positive attitude towards
developing a constructive dialogue with the Bank in the future and towards an increase in Bank’s
involvement.
Proposalsfor Bank Engagement: C i v i l society welcomed the opportunity to collaborate
with Government and the Bank in the reconstruction o f those values that were lost as a result ol
the crisis, and in ensuring that the needs o f the most vulnerable groups are addressed. The need
for broader reforms in the ‘education sector, with the active involvement o f the teachers, was alsc
identified. With respect t o the productive sector, the scope for wide participation o f the civil
society in the design and implementation o f programs targeted at small and medium enterprises,
micro-enterprises and cooperatives was also highlighted. In the area o f state reforms, c i v i l societj
would welcome a future involvement in the monitoring o f results obtained by the public sector.

87.
CAS Completion Report. The C A S Completion Report (Annex 1) notes that the
economic crisis o f 2002 was anticipated as a possible, albeit not highly likely, risk scenario. The
2000 CAS explicitly acknowledged downside risks o f “a recession (or even more severe

37

economic crisis) in either Argentina or Brazil” which might cause Argentine residents to
withdraw their deposits from Uruguayan banks. Yet, while acknowledging the risk, the CAS did
not propose any contingency plan to deal with the likely dire consequences for Uruguay. In the
absence o f a country-specific contingency plan the Bank resorted t o a standard emergency
lending instrument, the Special SAL, to satisfy the urgent financial needs o f Uruguay. A
combination o f SALs and Special SALs effectively enabled the Bank t o contribute i t s share o f a
US$3.8 b i l l i o n package o f support from the IMF, the IADB and the Bank. However, the
compressed repayment schedule o f the Special S A L will create by itself and contribute, more
generally, t o a hump in debt service in 2006 and 2007 which may complicate the financing
challenges for Uruguay and which might have been avoided if alternative contingency plans had
been prepared ahead o f time. The Government has requested cancellation o f the remaining
tranches o f the second SSAL (para. 89). A lesson t o be learned, therefore, is that, whenever
serious downside risks are present, advance consideration should be given to contingency
planning and, ideally, financing terms should be compatible and conducive to advancing a robust
debt sustainability position.

88.
The C A S Completion Report also notes h o w the Bank was able t o respond promptly and
effectively to the crisis as it unfolded. In part that was possible because the Bank had already
assembled a broad body o f country experience through a diverse operational program and
through its analytic work. The country knowledge and experience gained from an active and
long-standing country program could be mobilized quickly to assemble an emergency program
o f support for crisis management. At the same time, a broad and deep country dialogue over
many years, not only with the Government, but also with the private sector, academia and c i v i l
society was instrumental in fostering an effective partnership with the client. Another lesson to
be learned, therefore, is that a strong corpus of country knowledge and a strong client
relationship should be pursued as a prerequisite for the effective delivery o f emergency Bank
assistance. Similarly, a close cooperation with other multilateral and bilateral partners enhances
the effectiveness o f the Bank’s country program.

90.

9 1.
The proposed lending program comprises three additional programmatic Development
Policy Loans in FY06-08. These operations are expected to be multi-sectoral in focus and
provide support to the Government in implementing reforms in the three key areas mentioned
above, namely public sector management, financial sector reform, and reform o f social
programs. Potential programs within these three broad areas which could be supported by the
DPLs are presented in Box 6. The specifics o f these programs would be geared to respond to the
corresponding development challenges presented in Section I V above.
92.

Within the public sector management area, the DPLs may focus on tax reforms and

elements o f the authorities’ expenditure management agenda such as public procurement and
social transfers. On the tax front, the aim will be essentially to improve equity o f the tax system,
while on the administrative side the focus will be on improving tax collection, which i s essential
to maintain the primary surplus. Regarding expenditure management, reform o f social transfers
are likely to play a leading role. It i s also possible that the DPLs may support some broader
institutional reforms within the public sector. In the financial sector, it i s expected that emphasis
w i l l be on strengthening the institutional framework for supervision, on continuing state bank

39

restructuring, particularly o f the BHU, and o n policies to promote the deepening o f capital
markets. Within the social context, the focus i s expected to be o n health and pension reforms
where efficiency improvements can improve overall social welfare while contributing to fiscal
stability and expenditure switching policies. The poverty and social impacts o f the reforms
would be assessed (paras. 101- 104) and, as noted above, mainstreamed throughout the thematic
areas. The preparation process for the DPLs would be designed to engage stakeholders and invite
public accountability.

D. Investment Lending Priorities and Entry Points
93.
Rebuilding of the investment pipeline starts with two projects designed to improve
transport access under the Transport Maintenance and Rural Access Project and support
investment in the strategically important agriculture sector under the Integrated Natural
Resources Project. These two projects are being presented t o the Board with the CAS and
represent a strong beginning to a renewed partnership with Uruguay in supporting critical public
investments. The two operations were largely prepared during the outgoing administration, but
could not be negotiated and delivered as the allocations under the previous CAS Progress Report
were exhausted. The new administration has confirmed that these two operations are also
consistent with i t s development priorities.
94.
T o support more efficient and accessible infrastructure systems, the Bank plans to assist
the authorities with: (i)
an Infrastructure Investment project that would address energy, security
and additional transport investments; and (ii)
a second phase o f the OSE Modernization and
Systems Rehabilitation Program (APL 11). The infrastructure investment project would address
energy security and additional transport investments to enhance regional integration,
competitiveness and urban transport that would complement the Transport Infrastructure
Maintenance and Rural Access Project. The A P L I1 project would build upon the efforts o f the
ongoing f i r s t phase of the Program to consolidate the institutional renewal o f OSE, particularly
the reforms aimed at improving governance and management o f the utility, complete and
consolidate the implementation o f public information and benchmarking system and
unaccounted-for water control program, universalize the provision o f potable water and increase
coverage o f sanitation services.
95.

A s agreed with the Government, the Bank plans to prepare an Institution Building
operation (FY07) which is expected to assist in the design and implementation o f institutional
reforms in the core fiscal, financial and social areas. The design o f this operation i s expected to
accommodate demands for institutional reforms which may emerge during the execution o f the
Government’s program. In the spirit o f clustering and enhanced multi-sectoral focus, the
Institution Building operation will replace potential smaller operations to address the institutional
building needs o f the various sectors.

96.

T o support improved living standards, the Bank is working with the authorities o n
investments to support the Government’s reform o f the national health insurance system through:
(i)overhaul o f the regulatory framework to make it more effective in providing consumer
protection, to improve incentives for efficiency in purchasing services from providers, to
allocates publics subsidies in a more equitable mode, and t o ensure access to health services for
the whole population; (ii)definition o f a mandated, explicit and guaranteed coverage for all

40

beneficiaries subject to public financing, including primary and secondary health prevention; (iii)
deepening initiated reforms o f the provider payment mechanism in ASSE and the link o f the
payment system to actual provision o f services to Ministry o f Health (MOH) beneficiaries; (iv)
providing financing for necessary investment to expand the primary health care network o f the
public system as it would require significant modernization in the move towards a national health
insurance and (v) definition and implementation o f a health service delivery system that caters to
the health needs o f the population, specifically improving the quality o f primary and secondary
health prevention. As regards support to social security, the Bank i s prepared to assist the
Government in considering options for pension reform, including linking the replacement rate to
the retirement age. As regards support for education, the Bank i s prepared to assist the
Government in improving the quality and equity o f the education system through a new lending
operation which could focus on continuing the Bank’s current support for the expansion o f fulltime schools in impoverished areas. Further, the Government might also seek support fiom the
Bank in its efforts to reform and modemize the administrative structure o f education
administration. A further entry point may be reforms and changes o f the unemployment
insurance and the family allowance program.

97.
Support for innovation, science and technology i s a high priority for the Bank program.
The objective i s to help the authorities address the broad issue o f innovation as a driver for
growth, thereby linking innovation to growing sectors in the economy. Efforts to strengthen o f
the national innovation system are likely to include support for the formulation o f an efficient
policy framework with strong incentives. Priority would be given to strengthening the
Government’s capacity to formulate a long-term policy vision supported by concrete policy

measures which would also include drafting a strategic innovation plan. The process i s expected
to involve stakeholders from several Ministries (including Finance, Education, Agriculture, and
Industry) as well as representatives from industry. A related action area may involve fostering
public-private linkages in the education sector. Grants and scholarships could be provided to
support: (i)cooperative research (support to research groups from universities, government
laboratories, and private industry undertaking collaborative research and development, and
research training in areas o f importance to industry); (ii)
advanced graduate programs in priority
fields; and (iii)
promoting ‘researcher in industry’ programs (expansion o f the stock o f highquality personnel in Uruguayan industry by awarding scholarships to doctoral students who
undertake a substantial part o f their thesis work in industry). A third action area would aim at
enhancing agricultural competitiveness and trade by linking the fundamental structural issues o f
innovation, sanitation, and integration. This work could build upon the Integrated Natural
Resources Project. Additional action areas could cover infrastructure and private sector
development.

98.
Grant activities. The above lending program will be supplemented by an active program
in environmental management which will seek to leverage GEF and Carbon Fund resources to:
(a) support regional grassland management (in a regional GEF-financed medium sized project
shared with Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina); (b) improve solid waste management, methane
capture, and electricity generation, using carbon finance, building on a successful pilot program
nearing completion in Maldonado and potentially expandable into Montevideo; (c) sequester
carbon and reduce methane emissions using a combination o f planted forests and efficient
livestock production systems; (d) and support to urban transport operational efficiency gains and
emissions reduction to help reduce transport-related carbon emissions. The above mentioned
41

assistance through GEF and Carbon Finance funds will be additional to the assistance provided
under the GEF-financed Integrated Ecosystem Management project, which i s blended with the
Integrated Natural Resources Project which will be presented to the Board together with the
CAS.

99.
In addition, support will be given, possibly through trust funds, to the implementation o f
national environmental priorities by National Directorate o f Natural Resources o f the Ministry o f
Agriculture and National Directorate o f Environment o f the Ministry o f Housing, Land Use and
Environment in their shared and even overlapping capacities. A Statistics Support Grant has been
requested to provide support to the National Institute o f Statistics (INE).
100. The program will further be complemented by institutional strengthening initiatives and
grass-root capacity building activities financed from the IDF and other grant facilities. The
proposed priorities are to use IDF capacity-building resources to support (a) the new Ministry o f
Social Development, which has the broad mandate o f fostering inclusion and lobbying to reduce
inequality across a wide range o f government programs and policies, and (b) NGOs and N G O
networks actively supporting youth, afro-descendents, women and other socially excluded
vulnerable groups. Both IDF and project funding (such as through the proposed Institution
Building Project) could be specifically targeted to support the Government’s strategy o f making
social services more accountable and responsive to end-users by financing activities that promote
voice and client power mechanisms. Specifically, support could be given in such areas as (a)
drafting and implementing the Ley Bdsica de Participacidn Institucional and (b) designing the
Consejo ciudadano de seguimiento de 10s compromisos de gobierno.
E. AAAandESW

101. The Bank’s non-lending program (Table 8) aims to assist the Government in translating
selected development priorities into action agendas, underpin lending operations, and provide
policy advice as requested. The proposed ESW program seeks to respond to evolving
Government priorities in a flexible and agile manner so as to effectively contribute to the policy
debate on key development issues. We will identify together with the authorities additional areas
where the Bank i s well placed to provide the Government with the needed analytical support.
Furthermore, the Bank expects to increase i t s involvement in outreach activities which will foster
civil society participation and to mainstream the use o f PSIAs as part o f i t s ESW program.

102. A Public Expenditure Review (PER) and a Health Strategy are ongoing and will be
discussed with the authorities in the near future. These studies have a fiscal dimension, but also
focus on the issue o f equity in access. The health and education chapter o f the PER include an
incidence analysis, while the social protection chapter o f the PER and the recently concluded
Policy Notes include the coverage rates o f major social programs among the poor.
103. It i s expected that trade will be an area where the Bank could be potentially involved in
providing the Government with the needed policy advice, and additional areas will be discussed
with the authorities in the coming months. The Bank would also consider providing advice to the
Government in the implementation o f the newly approved legislation on anti-money laundering
and combating the financing o f terrorism, upon request by the authorities. Clustering o f
areadtopics under a single piece o f ESW will be one o f the guiding principles in the further
42

development o f the program. The ESW program currently includes in FY06, the completion o f
the Update to the 2000 Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR), which will assess the
impact o f procurement modernization actions since 2000 and will identify possible future
initiatives. The FY06 program will also include the completion o f an Investment Climate
Assessment, two Reports on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSCs) on insolvency and
governance and a Financial Sector Assessment. The latter will provide the new administration
with a menu o f options for continuing the ongoing reforms o f the financial sector and the
development o f capital markets. The Equity and Quality o f Education Economic and Sector
Work (ESW), also planned for FY06, w i l l analyze the degree to which the current system o f
assignment o f teachers and students contributes to maintaining inequities in the education system
and will explore options for increasing equality in education.

104. Starting in FY06 and continuing on throughout the CAS period, the ESW program will
be articulated around programmatic multisectoral development policy reviews (DPRs). Each o f
the DPRs will f i r s t have a topical focus. A social sector DPR i s planned to start in FY06 with
particular focus on poverty and employment. A sectoral DPR in FY07 will focus on
infrastructure. In FY08, the planned DPRs will focus on agriculture and the environment. In
addition to focusing on a specific topic, the DPRs will cover cross-cutting issues including fiscal,
growth, social inclusion, social accountability and environmental management. In this way, the
DPRs are expected to provide the core analytical and safeguard framework for the DPLs,
including Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIAs). The PSIAs are expected to provide an
analysis o f the distributional impact o f key reforms supported by the DPLs. The DPRs are further
expected to provide a framework for poverty and inequality monitoring. This could include
support for new survey work on rural poverty. In addition to formal ESW, some sector studies
will be conducted by the Government and the Bank in the context o f project preparation or
implementation.

G. Portfolio Management

106. Uruguay’s current portfolio reflects commitments for a total o f US$542 million o f which
roughly half correspond to investment projects and the balance to t w o o f the policy based
operations approved in 2003 (Public Services & Social Sectors S A L and SSAL). About 80
percent o f the investment portfolio commitments correspond to projects in the infrastructure
sector, while maintaining some modest investments in the education and agricultural sectors. N o
new investment operations have been approved since April 2002 as the lending envelope under
the 2000 CAS was exhausted with the policy based loans approved in the midst o f the crisis.

107. Portfolio performance during the period 2002-2003 was seriously affected by the crisis as
the fiscal restrictions limited the possibility for execution o f some o f the key investment
programs, particularly in the areas o f energy and roads. In addition, two projects were facing
some endogenous difficulties that led to their downgrading to unsatisfactory status after the
crisis. Investment portfolio performance reached its lowest level in FY03 when total
disbursements reached only US$16.3 million, equivalent to 11 percent o f total undisbursed funds
o f an aged portfolio expected to be disbursing at a rate close to triple that amount.
108. A major joint effort has been launched since then to improve portfolio performance.
There have been semi annual portfolio performance reviews involving the Government and all
project entities aimed at probing the cross cutting and project specific issues affecting portfolio
performance. The project teams have intensified the supervision efforts and there has been
increased responsiveness by the Government to ensure that projects have adequate budgetary
allocations. Special efforts were made to ensure increased responsiveness o f projects to the
country’s post crisis investment requirements and actions were undertaken to address project
implementation difficulties. The results have been positive. Project execution levels more than
doubled during the course o f FY04 to US$35.8 million - representing 21 percent o f total
undisbursed funds - and disbursements during the current FY are expected to remain at similar
levels. The problem projects have overcome their implementation difficulties and currently all
the projects in the portfolio are rated satisfactory.
109. The main challenges ahead in terms o f portfolio management will be the orderly closure
o f five o f the six projects currently in implementation and ensuring that the new operations
approved will begin implementation swiftly, breaking with the past experience o f slow
execution. Achieving faster implementation rates will continue to be an important challenge for
both the Bank and the Government. The Bank will maintain a proactive dialogue with the
Government on portfolio management to ensure that new projects will be undertaken in an
environment that i s conducive to a more efficient project execution to ensure the projects are
effectively contributing to their expected results.

H. The Role o f IFC, MIGA and WBI
110. IFC. IFC’s strategy for Uruguay for the last few years has been focused on the
management o f its existing portfolio, which was negatively affected in the aftermath o f the
Argentine crisis. A s stabilization and reform efforts advanced, IFC focused on pursuing
opportunities to support the private sector, particularly in activities that would help reactivate
growth and increase exports. During this period, a project o f US$30 m i l l i o n in the agrobusiness
45

sector has been committed. The project i s for Conaprole, the National Cooperative o f Milk
Producers and one o f the country’s main exporters. The project aims at enhancing the efficiency
of Conaprole’s operations and at helping i t to remain competitive in the world markets. The
current portfolio includes projects in the agrobusiness, education, infrastructure and finance

sectors.

111. Going forward, IFC’s strategy will focus on supporting the expansion o f the private
sector in areas where Uruguay i s internationally competitive and on selectively supporting
private infrastructure and projects that facilitate access to financing for second tier enterprises.
Given the State relative strong presence in the infrastructure sector, IFC could consider exploring
opportunities under PPP schemes for sectors under which the regulatory framework i s conducive
and provides opportunities for IFC to add value to these projects. I t would also explore
opportunities that may arise through regional projects, either at the Mercosur level or at the
broader level. IFC’s pipeline currently includes projects in the export-oriented manufacturing
sector.
112. MIGA. MIGA’s activities in Uruguay have been concentrated in the financial sector
until FY02. At that time, with the expiry o f existing contracts o f guarantee in the country.

MIGA’s exposure to Uruguay risk disappeared from the Agency’s portfolio. During FY05,
MIGA has experienced a growing interest for guarantees for investments in Uruguay. This has
resulted, thus far, in one contract o f guarantee covering the equity investments in the solid waste
management concession awarded to a private operator in the city o f Montevideo. In addition,
MIGA i s currently examining other requests for guarantees, and expects to see an important
increase in i t s exposure to Uruguay over the next couple o f calendar years.
113, WBL During the previous CAS period, approximately 300 representatives from
Uruguayan government agencies, civil society organizations, academia and the private sector
participated in courses, conferences, GDLN (Global Development Learning Network) dialogues
and other learning programs offered by the World Bank Institute (WBI). Much o f this
participation was through global and regional programs. Training programs delivered in Uruguay
included courses in infrastructure regulation and education reform. WBI will support the new
CAS objectives by continuing to include Uruguay in i t s various learning and capacity
development programs to be offered over the duration o f the CAS and will attempt, wherever
possible, to link these learning programs to ongoing and planned operational activities. In
addition to the delivery o f learning activities, WBI will provide support to the GDLN Center in
Uruguay through i t s GDLN Services Unit.

46

VII. LENDING SCENARIOS AND PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
A. Base Case Lending

114. The C A S envisages a base case scenario o f up to US$SOO million over the period through
FY10. The program for the initial years o f the CAS period (end-FY05-08) would provide for a
total o f up to US$600 million in commitments (Table 8). The program for the last two years o f
the program will be formulated as the CAS progresses and presented to the Board in a CAS
Progress Report in FY08.
115. The C A S lending program will be modulated on the strength o f the Government’s
program and its ability to implement it, as well as the country’s creditworthiness and the Bank’s
exposure. Creditworthiness will improve to the extent that Uruguay maintains credible
macroeconomic policies and makes concrete progress in implementing structural reforms in key
areas related to fiscal sustainability, reduced financial vulnerability, improved regulatory
framework for infrastructure investment and public services, and enhanced social protection.
Improved creditworthiness will be reflected in improved debt sustainability indicators. N e w
development policy lending early on in the program period i s expected to support selected
structural reforms in the three key areas (public sector management, financial sector reform and
reform o f social programs), while improved regulation will be supported through the restructured
S A L 11. The expectation is that up-front reform implementation will support improvements in
creditworthiness which will allow for a substantial rebuilding o f the investment pipeline.

116. As indicated in Table 9, the proposed base case lending will have implications for Bank
exposure. Broadly, exposure would gradually increase from US$785 m i l l i o n in CY04 to reach
US$965 million in CY09. However, policy-based lending will depend upon the progress made in
actually implementing reforms. Slower than expected execution o f reforms and/or the
investment program would delay new Bank operations and reduce the amount o f actual
commitments under the new CAS below the US$SOO million envelope. In this regard, self-

47

correcting mechanisms are built into the CAS to modulate Bank exposure in line with
performance benchmarks.
117. The linkage between country performance and new Bank lending will be made o n the
basis o f a focused set o f base case triggers (Box 7). If the macroeconomic framework, reform
implementation, or improvement in debt sustainability were to fall significantly below
expectations during the first three years o f CAS implementation, the Bank would refrain from
further development policy lending and slow new investment lending. Under this l o w case
scenario, total lending commitments would be reduced by at least US$300 m i l l i o n with respect
to the base case envelope. Parameters for determining lending plans for the reminder o f the CAS
period would then be reassessed in the CAS Progress Report planned t o be presented to the
Board in FY08. A change in the status o f portfolio implementation to unsatisfactory would also
be grounds for slowing down new investment lending until satisfactory status were restored.
Were reform and investment program implementation t o exceed expectations, allowing Uruguay
to largely recover i t s investment grade status, this would open up the perspective o f accelerated
implementation o f the lending program and a possibly enhanced level o f Bank support to be
discussed at the time o f the Progress Report. Finally, were Uruguay to be hit by a new external
shock large enough to impact growth and debt sustainability, the lending program would be
reassessed based o n the Government’s policy response and, if judged appropriate, a revised
strategy would be presented to the Board in the months following the shock.

VIII. IMPLEMENTING THE CAS

A. Expected Results o f the CAS
118. Indicative outcomes and results indicators are presented in the annexed CAS Results
Matrix. Expected CAS outcomes as outlined in the Results Matrix will be further refined as the
required information becomes available and could be subject to change. This will be reflected in
the CAS Progress Report which w i l l be prepared at the end o f the third year o f CAS
implementation. The CAS Progress Report w i l l provide a preliminary stocktaking o f the program
and the revised indicators will reflect the status o f program implementation at that stage. A
Client Survey will also be carried out during the third year o f program implementation.
B. Decentralization

119. With the decentralization o f the Southern Cone Department and reactivation o f the Bank
program in response to the crisis, there has been a marked increase in visits o f the Country
Director and other Bank staff to Montevideo. In addition, and with the strong increased demands
for Bank assistance, the Bank w i l l open a liaison office in Montevideo, effective mid-2005,
which will further enhance the dialogue and implementation o f the Bank’s program.

C. Partnerships
120. International Monetary Fund. Since liquidity problems were at the center o f the crisis in
Uruguay, the IMF appropriately took a lead role in providing support from the international
financial community. In March 2002, the IMF approved a Stand-by arrangement which, together
with a supplement in June of that year, amounted to US$2.8 billion. Financing was used to
restructure the banking system, strengthen fiscal performance to assure medium-term debt
sustainability and to foster private sector participation in basic services with a view to improving
productivity and efficiency. All of the reviews of the Stand-by arrangement proceeded well,
albeit with some delays. Bank restructuring has been the most difficult issue to resolve,
particularly the liquidation of banks that had no prospect o f regaining financial viability. In
February 2005, the IMF Board approved the seventh and final review. The ex-post assessment
of the program was discussed by the IMF Board on March 18,2005.
121, A new program with the IMF will be crucial to ensure sustained macroeconomic stability.
The Government has reached agreement with IMF staff on a new three year Stand-by
arrangement through mid-2008 which i s expected to be presented to the IMF Board in early
June. IMF staff are proposing access under the new program to cover 60 percent o f repayments
due over the program period which amount to approximately US$1.9 billion at current exchange
rates.
122. Inter-American Development Bank. Since the 1990s, the IADB has become the largest
multilateral development partner to Uruguay and has played a prominent role in helping the
country overcome the crisis in 2002. The strategic framework for IADB’s assistance was
articulated in a Country Paper covering the period 2000-2004. The Country Paper provided
financing for a program o f US$1 billion over the five-year period. An alternative scenario
involving credits o f over US$1.2 billion was also foreseen in case the implementation o f
49

structural reforms aimed at sustained export-led growth within a framework o f macroeconomic
stability and improved social equity required additional funds. That program was accelerated as a
result o f the 2002 crisis and, with the approval o f a US$500 million loan for Social Protection
and Sustainability in August 2002, overall lending exceeded the basic loan scenario. In 2003, the
IADB approved additional commitments in the order o f US$260 million, and in 2004 it approved
an additional U S 7 7 million for a Highway Infrastructure loan.

123. A new Country Strategy for Uruguay i s currently under preparation for presentation to
IADB Management’s Programming Committee in June 2005 and presentation to the Board o f
Directors in the fourth quarter o f the calendar year. Lending under the new program i s expected
to be commensurate with Uruguay’s public financing needs which include large repayments to
IADB.
124. Civil society. In implementing the CAS, we w i l l identify areas that will assist the
Government in building relationships with civil society. During the CAS consultations process, a
number o f areas have been discussed. In the area o f social inclusion, civil society could play a
major role in ensuring that the needs o f the most vulnerable are addressed, and in education the
active involvement o f teachers could contribute to future reform efforts. In addition, civil society
could assist the Government in designing and implementing programs for small and medium
enterprises, micro-enterprises and cooperatives. In the area o f state reforms, civil society could
play a key role in monitoring the results obtained by the public sector.

D. Fiduciary Assessment
125. The recently completed economic and sector work in financial management and
accounting indicates that the fiduciary environment i s Uruguay does not present major issues,
and that overall the country presents a low level o f fiduciary risk. However, more remains to be
done in terms o f improving some o f the procedural, institutional and legal aspects relating to
both procurement and financial management. With the completion o f a Country Financial
Accountability Assessment (CFAA) jointly with the Inter American Development Bank (IADB)
in 2003, and the planned completion of an Update to the 2000 Country Procurement Assessment
Report (CPAR) in early FY06, there are no gaps in core diagnostic ESW. Looking forward, we
w i l l address fiduciary issues systematically by more effectively integrating the recommendations
o f the fiduciary work into the lending program.
126. Procurement. A CPAR for Uruguay carried out in 2000 found no serious systemic
problems affecting public procurement, and corruption was found not to be an issue. However,
the report identified a number of legal, institutional and procedural aspects that needed
improvement. From the Bank’s perspective, procurement has been singled out in the past as one
o f the areas o f delay and contention in portfolio management. The major shortcoming in the
procurement area i s that the country lacks a national procurement law. The public procurement
legal framework i s provided by the Code o f Accounting and Financial Management (Text0
Ordenado de Contabilidad y Administracidn Financiera or TOCAF), which i s a compilation o f
provisions found in budgetary and financial laws. The procurement provisions in the TOCAF are
very general and provide considerable latitude for interpretation. Consequently, harmonized
procedures and documentation i s lacking.

50

127. In addition, the Court o f Audits (Tribunal de Cuentas) i s frequently a source o f delay for
the procurement process. The Court does not have an ex-ante responsibility, but i s required to
issue opinions on procurement documents and decisions. Such opinions are not mandatory, but
are generally respected by the Executive Branch The Court i s required to issue its opinions
within a specific and relatively short time frame, although through bureaucratic maneuvering
which often take a long time, thereby disrupting the procurement process with limited value
added.
128. As a follow-up to the 2000 CPAR, an IDF Grant completed in FY04 aimed at assisting
Uruguay to improve the legal procurement framework, establishing an e-procurement system and
conducting staff training, concurrently with complementary efforts supported by an IADB’s
State Modernization project. Considerable progress has been made since the year 2000 on
enhancing the institutional framework, establishing e-procurement information and standard
documentation for procurement o f goods, and staff training. The Office o f Planning and Budget
(OPP) has been assigned the lead role in public procurement. In addition, centralized systems for
procurement o f medicines and food were established in the Ministry o f Economy and Finance
(MEF) in 2003. Despite this progress, a national procurement law stalled in the National
Congress.
129. The Uruguayan Congress i s currently considering a bill to modify procurement
legislation, including new procedures which seek to increase the reduction in costs that the
central administration has already experienced as a result o f previous reform efforts. Congress
has made compliance with procurement laws a requirement for all public entities, which provides
a significant legal mechanism for those outside the central administration. Some o f the
noteworthy aspects o f this proposed law are as follows: (a) to promote e-procurement and the
publication o f information not only with regard to specific procedures on the Government’s
website, but also framework contracts. This permits a centralized procurement o some goods, the
delivery o f which depends on the needs o f each executive unit; (b) a differentiation in
procurement procedures both regarding the amounts involved as well as for the specific types o f
product that w i l l be purchased. This will allow for economies o f scale, however, it should be
borne in mind that competition may also be reduced; and (c) the introduction price lists for
procurement which are continually updated by the authorities. This would allow the traditional
mechanism o f direct procurement to be partially replaced, and s t i l l provide a system o f
permanent bidding for prices, or at least generate a maximum reference price for purchases by
the public sector.
130. A CPAR Update currently under preparation and scheduled for completion in FY06 i s
intended to assess the impact o f procurement modernization actions since 2000 and to review
with the new administration the possibility to proceed with other initiatives, including the
enactment o f a national public procurement law, further strengthening o f the institutional
capacity, the harmonization o f procurement practices in the central government institutions, the
municipalities and state owned public utilities, and reviewing the role o f the private sector.
13 1. In particular, the Bank could support Uruguay through technical assistance to more fully
implement the modernization o f state purchasing. For example, the SICE integrated purchasing
system could be brought into a more general use among the executive units, or at least those
within the Central Administration. This would facilitate the standardization o f procurement
51

procedures and compliance with the country’s legal framework. Bringing SICE into general use
also would provide a guarantee o f compliance with procedural rules, such as the obligation to
publish on the website and ensure payments by the State are recognized for purchasing. I t would
also allow for a more wide-ranging control o f the calls for bids and the “extension” o f such calls,
an aspect that i s currently difficult to control in Uruguay. Generalized implementation o f the
system would also be useful for keeping suppliers up to date with their tax payments.
132. Financial management. The latest C F A A prepared jointly with the IADB in 2003
indicates that there are no major concerns on financial management and accountability, and that
in general public sector financial management in Uruguay continues to be transparent, albeit
bureaucratic. Further, bank financed projects usually receive unqualified opinions from extemal
auditors and they are received by the Bank in a timely manner. With respect to the 2000 CAS
objective to establish more transparent accounting and budget processes, progress i s being made
toward improving the transparency o f fiscal policy setting, budget management and accounting,
The quality o f fiscal data has substantially improved, performance o f the operational units o f the
public sector are more closely monitored. However more proactive dissemination o f data on
budget performance is desirable.
133. Several areas of good practice were observed and included: (i)an adequate legal
framework for financial accountability; (ii)clear division o f the roles o f the Executive and
complete and systematic revenue
Legislative Branches in terms of financial administration; (iii)
and expenditure classifications; (iv) budget execution and control at a decentralized level; (v) a
mandate for the adoption o f internationally accepted accounting standards for the public sector
by end o f 2005; and (vi) timely submission to the Legislature o f the Annual Consolidated Report
o f Budget Execution.
134. Notwithstanding the current economic climate and institutional arrangements goveming
public expenditures, the C F A A concluded that the efficiency and transparency o f public
expenditures and financial management operations could be improved even further and the
C F A A recommended a mix o f short term and medium t e r m actions to support the further reform
and modemization o f the state and improve governance.
135. Overlaps in duties performed by the Internal Audit Office, the Delegated Accountants,
the Court o f Accounts, and the General Accounting Office and the onerous ex-ante controls
performed by the Court of Accounts reduce the efficiency o f these control functions and increase
bureaucracy. During the CAS period, efforts will be undertaken to mobilize World Bank
Technical Assistance and Institutional Development grants as appropriate instruments to support
the rationalization o f the duties o f the various control functions.

E. Country Financing Parameters
136. The new Country Financing Parameters agreed with the Government are presented in
Annex 7. The Government has welcomed the increased flexibility that the new Bank policy
provides with regard to eligible expenditures. However, the degree to which the Government
would like to use the increased flexibility depends largely o n its strategy for funding
development needs. The degree to which the Bank will use the increased flexibility will in tum

52

depend on the Bank’ overall exposure, as well as the impact o n the Bank’s ability to fund other
projects under the CAS and the potential to reduce transaction costs.

137. In terms o f cost sharing, the new parameters propose flexibility for the Bank to finance
up to 100 percent o f total project costs, when this would result in substantially reduced
transaction costs and in a substantial impact on poverty alleviation. In other cases, flexibility in
cost sharing will depend upon the Bank’s overall lending envelope, and subject to satisfactory
ownership o f the overall program and at the sector level. The Bank’s financing share o f
individual projects is however expected to continue at current levels.
138. With regard to Bank financing o f recurrent costs, the new parameters propose no countrylevel limit, F r o m an economic perspective, sound fiscal management and the fact that Bank
financing is fully integrated in the budget and taken into account in fiscal and debt targets
indicate that financing o f recurrent costs would not jeopardize overall fiscal or debt
sustainability. Therefore, no country-level limit on recurrent cost financing is proposed. From a
project perspective, financing o f recurrent costs under Bank projects is likely to continue to take
place only in exceptional cases, although in the future increased flexibility may be applied when
there are special emergency and project-related circumstances.
139. In terms o f local cost financing, the requirements for Bank financing o f local
expenditures are met, and the new parameters allow financing o f local costs in the proportion
needed in individual projects. The change in policy i s not expected to represent a major deviation
from the prevailing practice in local cost financing in Uruguay, since the Bank has been
financing substantial local costs in the past. With respect to taxes and duties, the new financing
parameters allow the Bank to finance all taxes and duties associated with project expenditures
with the exception o f import tariffs above 28 percent, which is the average o f the Mercosur
common external tariff. At the project-level, the Bank would also consider whether taxes and
duties constitute an excessively high share o f project costs.

F. IBRD Financial Products
140. IBRD financing and risk management products could provide some needed flexibility to
Uruguay to manage its debt. This includes flexible repayment terms to smooth the debt
repayment profile in order to reduce rollover risk and the possibility to change the financial
characteristics o f IBRD loans to better manage financial risks relating to currency, interest rate
and commodity price volatility caused by external factors. For its new IBRD loans, Uruguay has
moved to the Fixed Spread Loan (FSL) but has not taken advantage o f the embedded risk
management tools included in the FSLs that the Government could use to manage currency,
interest rate and rollover risks. Furthermore, Uruguay might want to consider signing a Master
Derivatives Agreement with IBRD, which would give Uruguay access to a range o f IBRD
financial products that could help the Government manage the interest rate and currency risks o f
its overall debt portfolio. The Country Management Unit (CMU) i s actively exploring with the
authorities their interest in having a Bank team visit Uruguay in the near future to better illustrate
to the authorities the available IBRD financing and risk management products.
141. The choice of IBRD loans, guarantees and hedging products might help manageheduce
Uruguay’s vulnerability to external shocks, and could be applied to both the portfolio and at the

53

level o f individual projects, both ongoing and in the pipeline. At the portfolio level, well
structured IBRD financial products could support Uruguay to better manage risks inherent in i t s
debt. This could be achieved through the use of: (i)traditional IBRD lending as needed; (ii)
guarantees; and (iii)IBRD intermediation for long dated risk management tools. At the
individual project level, the Government will be able to use flexible features embedded in IBRD
loans along with IBRD risk management products and guarantees to maximize developmental
impacts o f certain programs by achieving the desired cost/risk structure o f certain existing
projects or structuring more adequate financing for new ones.

G. Risks
142. Notwithstanding the satisfactory progress o f Uruguay in consolidating i t s economic
recovery, a number o f important risks must be acknowledged. Most important i s the risk
associated with debt sustainability which, in turn, i s closely related to the dependency o f
Uruguay upon events in neighboring countries, particularly Argentina. Uncertainty about the
new administration’s ability to deliver on its program o f reforms constitutes a political and social
risk. There are also a number o f other risks o f lesser importance such as energy dependency.
143. Political transition. For the first time in 40 years, the FA-EP-NM ruling coalition w i l l
have an absolute majority in parliament. However, its majorities in both houses are small and the
FA-EP-NM i s a broad coalition o f parties and movements ranging from the center left to the
radical left. The President may therefore have difficulty maintaining discipline within the
coalition, especially when voting on controversial legislation. The opposition may also seek to
exploit political differences within the Frente Amplio and might trumpet any inconsistencies
between the coalition’s polices while in opposition and those in government. Lack o f
cohesiveness within the coalition may also result in political indecision. However, the President
has been the undisputed leader o f the coalition for almost a decade and has proved to be capable
o f exercising his power to settle internal differences and mediating between the coalition’s
factions in the past. In addition, as President he w i l l use his power of appointment to secure the
support o f the different factions, and i s reaching out to all elements o f Uruguayan civil society.
This augurs well for keeping the Government’s program on track and reducing risks o f policy
slippage. This risk i s assessed as low.
144. Social risk. The risk associated with the political transition also has a social dimension.
The population has paid a high social price for the crisis, including unemployment and a
reduction in real wages. The political transition has generated high expectations among the
population that urgent social needs will be met. High popular expectations have increased
pressure on the Government to deliver quickly on i t s program. There i s therefore a social risk
associated with the fact that the authorities may not be able to deliver on their program as
quickly as the public expects, or in a manner that meets popular expectations. Particularly
important, employment and real wages could lag behind economic growth. The result could
engender social discontent. As was the case with the December 2004 referendums, popular
sentiments could drive the Government’s decisions in key areas o f the reform program. This risk
i s assessed as moderate.
145. Debt sustainability Debt sustainability will continue to be a major issue for economic
management in the medium term notwithstanding the successful debt restructuring o f 2003
54

which provided relief from liquidity pressures over the short and medium term. The ratio o f
public debt to GDP i s estimated to stand at about 90 percent at end-2004 and heavy
amortizations due in the period 2006-07 constitute a potential threat to liquidity. Most o f those
obligations are due to multilateral financial institutions, particularly the IMF. Uruguay w i l l need
to rely upon continued support from the international financial institutions and access to financial
markets at interest rates commensurate with i t s economic growth prospects. The debt
sustainability risk i s currently assessed as high, but expected to decline over time provided the
Government can sustain strong macroeconomic and structural policies.
146. Three factors that heavily influence debt sustainability are economic growth, fiscal
policy, and the real exchange rate (Annex 2). Growth improves debt sustainability by increasing
resources available to finance the public debt. Sustained growth o f at least 3 percent i s targeted
under the base case. There i s a risk that slippage in the structural reform agenda or additional
external shocks could jeopardize growth and thereby undermine debt sustainability. Fiscal
policy, in particular a significant primary surplus, contributes directly to debt sustainability by
reducing the Government’s borrowing requirement. Under the base case, a sustained primary
surplus at or above the level achieved in 2004 i s targeted. Maintaining the primary surplus at
this level w i l l require disciplined expenditure control which may prove difficult. The post-crisis
fiscal adjustment has largely depended upon restraining nominal wages and wage-indexed
pensions which will now be subject to upward pressure. Achieving the primary surplus target
w i l l hinge on structural reforms in tax, pensions, health, and state modernization, as well as in
infrastructure and public services to support private sector participation-thereby reducing
pressure on the public investment budget. Experience indicates that these reforms are not easy to
implement in any country. Finally, debt sustainability in Uruguay i s sensitive to the path o f the
real exchange rate given the large share o f public debt denominated in foreign currency. As
demonstrated by the crisis, a sharp drop in the value o f the peso can dramatically increase the
domestic currency value of Uruguay’s external debt. Under the base case, the peso i s projected
to appreciate moderately in concert with sustained economic recovery. However, this w i l l
depend not only on credible macroeconomic policies but also on structural reforms to improve
the investment climate, thereby sustaining growth and attracting capital inflows.
147. IBRD exposure. The total o f IBRD debt outstanding and disbursed stood at US$785
million at end December 2004, and Uruguay’s share o f the total Bank portfolio was 0.7 percent.
That compares with an average o f 0.5 percent throughout the nineties. W h i l e a small share o f the
portfolio in relative terms, Uruguay’s per capita exposure i s the third highest in the Bank. This
justifies close monitoring. Recent lending included two special SALs in 2002 and 2003 in the
amounts o f US$15 1.5 million and U S $ l O l million respectively, under which a total o f US$177.5
million has been disbursed. The shorter amortization o f those special SALs will cause a
bunching o f payments that will need to be carefully managed. With good macroeconomic
management and reform, this risk i s assessed as moderate; under deteriorating macroeconomic
conditions this risk would be assessed as high.
148. Regional shocks. Uruguay i s exceptionally vulnerable to shocks emanating from
neighboring Brazil and Argentina - particularly the latter. It was the crisis in Argentina that
triggered events in Uruguay during 2001-02. Generally speaking the economic performance of
Uruguay tracks that of Argentina quite closely. If there were to be a serious setback to the
recovery currently under way in Argentina, there i s likely to be a parallel setback in Uruguay,
55

although not necessarily o f the same magnitude. In the last couple o f years, Uruguay has
diversified its export markets and that will reduce i t s vulnerability. Whereas Brazil and
Argentina used t o account for 50 percent o f Uruguay’s exports they n o w amount t o only 30
percent. In addition, the United States became Uruguay’s largest export market in 2004,
accounting for one fifth of export sales. Furthermore, Uruguay has already effectively adjusted
to accommodate many of the new post-crisis realities and that will further reduce its dependence
upon neighboring countries which have yet to make the adjustment. Under conditions o f regional
growth, this risk is assessed as moderate, but would increase to high were growth in Argentina to
fa1ter .

149. Energy security. Uruguay i s dependent upon Argentina for its supply o f energy,
particularly electric power and natural gas. In early 2004, Argentina, confronted with a domestic
energy shortage, reduced the supply of electricity and natural gas t o neighboring countries
including Uruguay. That experience underscored the vulnerability o f Uruguay. The Batlle
Government responded by seeking to diversify the sources o f supply, and there is currently an
agreement in place to import energy from Brazil, although this appears to be temporary.
Therefore, energy dependency i s a potential source o f risk which could threaten economic
recovery if supplies were to be interrupted. The new Government is aware o f this risk and i s
working toward more secure energy supply. This risk is currently assessed to be high.

URUGUAY: CAS Completion Report
Date o f CAS:
Date o f Progress Report:
Date o f Progress Report Update:

May 5,2000
July 25,2002
August 7,2002

Report No. 20355-UR
Report No. 244 10-UR
Memorandum o f President

Summary
This document contains an evaluation o f country developments in Uruguay and the respective contributions
o f the government and the Bank during the period o f the previous CAS (FY00-FY05).
The 2000 CAS was written at a time when, after a decade o f steady growth, it appeared that Uruguay would
soon be eligible for graduation from Bank lending. As a f i r s t step towards graduation, the 2000 CAS
proposed a level o f Bank lending that was about half o f the previous CAS period program. The proposed
lending program was to be based on three pillars:
Poverty reduction and social equity
Environmental and natural resource management
The role o f the state as an engine o f growth
At end-200 1, less than half way through the CAS period, neighboring Argentina was thrown into a deep
crisis and defaulted on its public debt after a devaluation o f i t s currency to one third o f its previous value.
The crisis quickly spread to Uruguay where, in 2002, GDP f e l l by 11 percent, unemployment rose to a peak
o f almost 19 percent - the highest level in twenty years - and poverty peaked at 3 1 percent in the last
quarter o f 2002.

The response o f the government was prompt and purposehl. It took the initiative to renegotiate the terms
o f the public debt with creditors and reached an accommodation that provided Uruguay with medium-term
debt relief. It took decisive measures to establish fiscal discipline, to restructure the financial sector and to
take other measures to stabilize the situation.

~

A CAS Update Report o f 2002 proposed an increase in financial support from the Bank as part o f a
combined program o f support along with the IMF and the IDB to help Uruguay overcome the crisis.
Structural Adjustment Lending and Special SALS were proposed as the preferred vehicle for Bank support.
Although the medium term vision continued to follow that outlined in the 2000 CAS, priorities and lending
instruments were to be changed to better reflect the immediate needs o f the country.
This CAS completion report concludes that the government was successful in stabilizing the situation and
that the Bank, together with other international financial institutions, contributed to that success by
adapting their country assistance programs appropriately. Hence, changes in the country assistance strategy
proposed in the 2002 CAS Update Report were successful in helping Uruguay recover from the economic
crisis and position itself better for sustained growth and poverty reduction. As the result o f an augmented
Bank engagement both at the operational level and at the level o f analytic and advisory services, the
government was better able to keep sight o f longer-term development issues notwithstanding i t s
preoccupation with crisis management.

P a r t A: Long-Term Strategic Goals
The government’s perspective

When president Batlle assumed office on March 1, 2000, his address to the
national General Assembly outlined clearly the main strategic goals for his forthcoming
five-year administration -- a period with which the 2000 CAS was designed to coincide
closely (FY200 1-FY2005).’ H e voiced particular concern that protectionism and a lack
o f competition in both public and private sectors, were adding unnecessarily to the cost o f
production and eroding the competitiveness o f Uruguayan products in the world market.
To remedy the situation and to reduce the excessive “costo Uruguay0 ” he proposed a
program o f reform that was to focus on seven issues o f particular concern:
1. Public expenditures would be prioritized with a view to eliminating waste.
2. Public enterprises would be reformed to improve the quality o f service provided
and to reduce prices to the consumer.
3. The relationship between the central government and the local government
authorities (intendencias) would be restructured to better foster decentralization.
4. Publicly accessible information systems would be established to make more
transparent the system o f government procurement and the granting o f
concessions for public works and services.
5. Private sector development would be encouraged by eliminating unnecessary
bureaucracy and by simplifying the procedures for market entry and exit.
6. With respect to state-owned enterprises, a clear separation would be made
between the provision o f infrastructure and public services o n the one hand, and
the regulation o f those enterprises on the other.
7. Social security contributions would no longer simply be invested in government
bonds but would be mobilized to finance productive investments in such basic
services as water supply, sanitation and infrastructure.
In addition to those seven cross-cutting issues which affect efficiency and

productivity across the board, president Batlle also focused o n a number o f sectorspecific issues in his address to the General Assembly and indicated h o w he intended to
deal with them in his forthcoming administration.

Acknowledging that agriculture is a major source o f export revenues for Uruguay,
the president called for better management o f the country’s water resources and for
improvements in animal husbandry such as would enable Uruguay to achieve a level o f
productivity comparable to that o f New Zealand within the space o f ten years.
The president also confirmed the commitment o f Uruguay to Mercosur and
expressed the desire that it may be broadened to include other nations with the long-term
objective o f creating a trade bloc that would encompass the entire western hemisphere
from Alaska to Ushuaia in the Tierra del Fuego.

O n social issues, the president expressed concern that many low-income families
were congregating in squatter settlements for lack o f alternative housing opportunities
and he proposed that the government supply them with housing sites furnished with basic
services o f water, sanitation and electric power upon which they may build more better
quality housing within a secure legal framework. H e also made special mention o f the
need to expand pre-school educational facilities, particularly for low-income groups.

The Bank’s program o f support
Bank support for the long-term development goals o f the government was
constrained by strategic considerations o f program size and structure. First, the Bank
perceived Uruguay as a country that was approaching the eligibility threshold for
graduation from Bank lending. Although, at the time o f preparing the 2000 CAS,
Uruguay was already experiencing a recession, the recession was perceived to be a
temporary interruption that did not appear to threaten the very real gains o f steady growth
during the preceding decade. The Executive Summary o f the 2000 CAS noted that the
country’s per capita income was already 20 percent above the Bank’s indicative threshold
for initiating graduation and concluded that “Given Uruguay ’s relatively high level of
social and economic development, the time has come to consider a gradual reduction in
support, reflecting the evolving nature of Uruguay’s development challenges and the
Bank’s role ”. Second, the CAS document noted that the Inter-American Development
Bank had been and s t i l l remained the main source o f external finance for Uruguay and,
hence, the Bank did not have a lead role in external assistance. As a result o f those two
considerations, the 2000 CAS proposed a 50 percent reduction in lending to Uruguay, on
a commitments basis, compared with the previous 1997 CAS. That proposal was also
broadly consistent with the findings o f an International Financial Institutional Advisory
Commission which had been established by the U S Congress under the chairmanship o f
Alan Meltzer. The report o f the Commission, issued in March 2000, recommended that
the World Bank and other similar development banks should lend less to countries that
have access to the international financial markets and focus more on low-income
countries with l i t t l e capital-market access.
Subject, as it was, to a strategic constraint o f program size, the CAS had to be
much more selective in i t s support for the government’s development agenda as
compared with the past. It was decided that the base-case lending program o f US$l50200 million for FY01-05 should include “selected investment lending in areas where
there is an important social or environmental dimension, and the Bank’s international
knowledge would be crucial to project success
In addition, “advisory and analytic
services (would) be used to guide the selectivity of the lending pipeline, and to maintain
an open policy dialogue with the government. It would also serve as background
preparation in the eventuality that a high case lending scenario is triggered.” A high
case scenario would have boosted lending to US$200 million and would have included
adjustment lending for financial sector or other critical reform areas.
’I.

Mindful o f the development objectives established by the Batlle administration
and seeking to support them within a constrained resource envelope for Bank lending, the
assistance strategy o f the 2000 CAS was established on three pillars as follows:
1,

2.

3.

Poverty reduction and social equity were to be fostered with investments in
education, health, community development and social infrastructure such as
water supply and sanitation. In parallel, an ambitious program o f analytic and
advisory work was envisaged including a multi-phased poverty assessment, a
health policy note and an assessment o f social expenditures.
Environmental and natural resource management were to be enhanced
with investments in maritime management and rural development together
with analytic work relating to an assessment o f rural conditions.
The role o f the state as an engine o f growth and i t s relationship to private
sector development was to be examined in the context o f a substantial
program o f analytic and advisory work in issues o f trade and competitiveness
as well as financial sector structures. Efficiency was to be enhanced and, at
the same time, the prospects for graduation from Bank lending were t o be
advanced with investments in public enterprise reform.

The main differences between the government’s development strategy and the
Bank’s selective program o f support probably lay in a lower level o f Bank lending for
basic infrastructure as compared with the past. Whereas the government clearly desired
to improve the efficiency o f infrastructure and public services across-the-board, only
water supply and sanitation figured in the proposed base-case lending program probably because o f their more immediately apparent social and environmental
dimensions. Other infrastructure, such as power supply and transport which had figured
prominently in previous Bank lending were notably absent from the much reduced 2000
CAS program. Instead, environmental initiatives such as maritime management together
with social sector investments in education, health and community development
constituted the core o f the program, consistent with the government’s own objectives in
those areas.
The Onset of Crisis and the Management o f Crisis

H a l f way through the period covered by the 2000 CAS, there was a radical and
unexpected reversal in the situation o f Uruguay which caused both the government and
the Bank to fundamentally reassess the entire program o f country assistance. Following
upon a decade o f macroeconomic stability and steady growth during the nineties,
Uruguay suffered a recession in 1999 and then collapsed into a deep economic crisis in
2002 when neighboring Argentina defaulted o n i t s public debt and devalued its currency
to one third o f its previous value.
The relative success with which Uruguay was able to weather the economic crisis
o f 2001/2 owes much to the government’s prompt and purposeful response to events as
they unfolded. Unlike neighboring Argentina, the economic crisis did not provoke a
political crisis nor did i t interrupt the normal procedures o f government. Political

Annex 1
Page 5 o f 27

continuity enabled the government to manage proactively the economic situation and to
mobilize an ‘already long-established social safety net to cushion poverty. Concerted
support from the international financial community was also an important factor in
assisting the government to cope with a difficult adjustment.
Among the strong adjustment measures undertaken by the government in
response to the crisis, the following were especially important in stabilizing the economy:

Fiscal adjustment was at the center o f Uruguay’s response to crisis
management. Public utility prices were quickly adjusted to reflect new
financial realities even though the scale o f the adjustment needed was
substantial. In 2003, the post-crisis year, the government achieved a primary
fiscal surplus equivalent to 2.7 percent o f GDP. That represented an
improvement o f 3.9 percentage points when compared with a 1.2 percent
primary fiscal deficit in 200 1, the pre-crisis year.
The 2002 crisis had a profound effect upon the monetary and exchange rate
policy o f Uruguay. The first response o f the Central Bank was to accelerate
the depreciation o f the Uruguayan peso within the framework o f the same
crawling peg mechanism that had prevailed in previous years. However, as
pressure mounted on the Uruguayan peso the Central Bank abandoned the
crawling peg altogether and allowed the currency to float in June 2002 The
result was a further sharp fall in the real effective exchange rate before it
stabilized later in the year.
Devaluation made it fiscally impossible to service the public debt most o f
which was dollar-denominated. The government took a bold initiative to
negotiate with bondholders a refinancing o f sovereign debt. Bondholders
recognized that Uruguay’s banking and debt problems were largely due to
contagion from the crisis in Argentina. They were receptive to refinancing to
avoid the government being pushed into a situation where default may be the
only alternative. The perception that the government was implementing a
sound fiscal and structural reform program was also an important
consideration for creditors. The outcome o f the negotiations was a debt swap
that permitted Uruguay to lengthen the maturity o f i t s sovereign debt over five
years without raising interest rates and with no reduction in principal. The
international financial markets were reassured by the successful outcome and
the country risk premium for Uruguay f e l l from 1800 basis points to i t s
current level o f 600 basis points.
The decision o f neighboring Argentina, in December 2001, to freeze bank
deposits and restrict capital outflows prompted a run o n Uruguayan banks for
fear that Uruguay may take similar action. Total deposits o f the non-financial
private sector in the banking system f e l l by 50 percent in the course o f 2002.
The government then sought assistance from the IMF, the World Bank and the
IDB for a program o f structural reform aimed at safeguarding the financial
system without channeling unnecessary support to institutions that had
become insolvent and had little prospect o f regaining financial viability. Four
insolvent commercial banks were closed and their residual portfolios o f

Annex 1
Page 6 o f 27

performing assets were transferred to a newly created commercial bank
which operates as a private entity even though the state is the sole shareholder
at this point in time. Nearly all other private commercial banks reported
losses in 2002 but they continued in business and their situation improved in
2003 as confidence returned and new deposits entered the system.
The dramatic increase in poverty provoked by the economic crisis revealed
serious shortcomings in the social safety net. Government action to address
those shortcomings and their attendant fiscal cost, was reviewed in the
preceding section above.
The crisis also underscored structural weaknesses in the provision and
management o f infrastructure and public services which the government
sought to address with assistance from the Bank.

The depth o f the economic crisis in Uruguay and the seriousness o f the
government’s response elicited strong support from both multilateral and bilateral
sources. In a j o i n t statement, issued on August 4, 2002, the IMF the IDB and the Bank
pledged as follows:
“The Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, the President of the
World Bank, and the President of Inter-American Development Bank announced today
that they w i l l recommend to their respective boards that financing be increased by
amounts that would bring total financing for Uruguay to US$3.8 billion fiom the three
institutions. They also announced that they would recommend accelerating disbursements
to Uruguay in order to make about US$1.5 billion available f i o m the three institutions
next week when authorized by their respective boards.
I n order to provide immediate financing to the Uruguayan government in support of the
banking system, the United States government has agreed to provide up to US$l.5 billion
in bridge financing to Uruguay’s central bank until international financial institution
loans are disbursed ’’

The Bank’s support for crisis management

A CAS Progress Report was prepared in July 2002. I t is to be interpreted within
the context o f a broader effort by the international financial community to assist Uruguay
at a time when the economic situation was deteriorating rapidly. The full dimensions o f
the crisis and its likely outcome could not be clearly discerned because events were s t i l l
unfolding. Nevertheless, the Progress Report determined that the 2000 CAS lending
scenario was no longer appropriate and concluded: “The situation now calls for

additional support to assist Uruguay to weather the current crisis and to continue the
program of reforms critical to a more competitive economy while maintaining investment
in human capital and reinforcing measures to protect vulnerable groups ”.

Events were developing so fast in 2002 that the July Progress Report had to be
supplemented with an Update issued on August 7. The Progress Report and its Update
proposed adjustment lending as the preferred instrument for increased Bank support to

Annex 1
Page 7 o f 27

Uruguay during the crisis period. The revised program outlined in the 2002 CAS
progress report covered a truncated period FY03-04 compared with the FY00-05 program
o f the original CAS. The shortening o f the program horizon to two years i s significant
because it indicates how the Bank perceived the situation in Uruguay to be fluid. The
revised objectives o f the 2002 CAS update report were characterized as follows:
“The updated Bank strategy focuses on pursuing the 2000 CAS agenda, but
within a crisis environment. The revised program targets three broad objectives
corresponding to the main challenges facing Uruguay, namely: (9 Jiscal sustainability
and adjustment, (ii) increasing competitiveness; and, (iii) social protection. I n each area
the Bank program offers financial and technical support, in concert with our major
partners, the IMF and the IDB. ” (para. 47)
Although the 2002 CAS Progress Report sought to preserve the threefold long
term objectives o f the 2000 CAS, both the government and the Bank were preoccupied
with managing an economic crisis o f major proportions during the remaining years o f the
program. The threefold organizational framework o f the 2000 country assistance strategy
remained in place but priorities were radically changed and alternative lending
instruments were chosen to better reflect the requirements o f a crisis environment. The
updated program and the revised country assistance strategy can be presented along the
following lines:

Poverty alleviation was to focus on measures for cushioning the impact o f
increasing poverty induced by unemployment and by other effects o f the
economic crisis. Quick disbursing finance was to be provided through
structural adjustment loans with conditionality explicitly protecting budgetary
support for important social programs at a time o f exceptional fiscal
constraint. At the same time, the Bank’s ongoing operational presence in the
health and education sectors became even more relevant in dealing with the
broader social consequences o f the crisis. Progress secured by those
operations was to be protected with support from a Special SAL.
Environment and natural resource management became an issue o f urgent
concern when Uruguay was afflicted with an outbreak o f foot and mouth
disease which threatened the national herd and resulted in a suspension o f beef
exports, thereby further deepening the economic crisis. The Bank response
was to put together a Foot an Mouth Disease Emergency Recovery Loan in
support o f a containment and recovery plan that would reinstate the sanitary
status o f the national herd on a sustainable basis and thereby enable Uruguay
to regain access to export markets and re-activate livestock production.
Previously envisaged longer-term plans such as improving the management o f
maritime and coastal resources were put on the back-burner pending a
resolution o f the prevailing economic crisis.
The role o f the state became an even more pressing issue as a result o f the
crisis. In that context, however, the priority objectives were to stabilize the
economy and recover the levels o f production that had been lost. At the same
time, it was recognized that structural weaknesses, particularly in the financial

Annex 1
Page 8 of 21

sector, the public enterprise sectors and in fiscal management would need to
be remedied in order for the economic recovery to remain securely in place
and serve as an effective foundation for sustained growth in the future.
Structural adjustment lending was the instrument o f choice for pursuing those
objectives and the strong program o f analytic work envisaged under the 2000
CAS facilitated the task o f putting together a total o f two SALS and two
Special SALS.

In summary, the period covered by the 2000 CAS encompassed two quite
separate and distinct country assistance strategies in response to a radical change o f
country circumstances.
The first strategy was predicated upon a measured
disengagement o f the Bank in preparation for the eventual graduation o f Uruguay. The
second strategy was based upon full re-engagement in concert with other donors to rescue
Uruguay from an unforeseen crisis. At the same time, it was apparent that the crisis had
revealed fundamental weaknesses and vulnerabilities in the Uruguayan economy such
that graduation from Bank lending would need to be postponed for the foreseeable future.

Part B - CAS Outcomes

Neither the 2000 CAS nor the 2002 Progress Report were “results-based”. That is
to say, n o quantifiable targets were specified as reference points against which actual
outcomes can be measured. Nevertheless, the country context and the text o f the
documents themselves provide a sufficiently clear indication o f anticipated outcomes.
This section assesses country progress and the Bank contribution to attaining the CAS
objectives.
Pillar 1: Poverty Alleviation

When the 2000 CAS was under preparation the Bank had an active operational
presence in both the health and education sectors. The ongoing investment operations
had been appraised at an earlier date before there was any sign o f a recession but the
effectiveness o f their outcome was enhanced when the economic environment
deteriorated. That was particularly true o f the Second Basic Education Quality
Improvement Project, the implementation o f which coincided closely with the economic
crisis. The implementation completion report for that operation noted that “ i n this
context of deteriorating economic conditions and increasing poverg, the objectives and
focus of (the project) became even more relevant JJ.2 It would appear that the Uruguayan
authorities shared the same viewpoint because, notwithstanding exceptional fiscal
constraints, counterpart funding for the project was not seriously interrupted and the
project was brought to a successful conclusion in February 2004. The fundamental
objectives o f the operation, (a) to expand the coverage and improve the quality o f
preschool and elementary education and (b) to achieve greater social equality by targeting
the expansion of the new full-time school model for preschool and elementary education
to socio-economically disadvantaged children, were both fully achieved and the
sustainability o f the outcome was judged to be likely.
Likewise, a Bank supported Health Sector Development Project successfully
achieved its objectives although it was substantially completed before the full crisis
struck and therefore did not have to contend with the difficult implementation
environment experienced by the education project3 The achievements o f the operation in
helping the government to rationalize health sector spending and to improve sector
management undoubtedly helped to cushion the social impact o f the economic crisis.
Even at the time o f the 2000 CAS, Uruguay was already experiencing increasing
unemployment and poverty as a result o f the 1999 recession. The poverty count had
already risen from 15.3 percent in 1999 to 17.8 percent in 2000. The initial response o f
the government was to rely upon already established programs o f social assistance and to
strengthen them where necessary. Those programs included a child development
program for children less than four years old living in poor households. There was also a
See ImplementationCompletion Report for a Second Basic EducationQuality Improvement Project. ReportNo. 29878 dated July
30,2004; Section 3.1 para.3.
See ImplementationCompletion Report for a Health Sector Development Project, ReportNo. 24995 dated December 12,2002,

Annex 1

housing program targeted to poor households in rural areas which, in 2000, the
government complemented with a similar program targeted to urban s l u m dwellers. The
overall effectiveness o f programs for poverty alleviation was eroded, however, by
growing fiscal constraints which caused social spending to respond pro-cyclically during
the period 1998-2001.

The severity o f the ensuing economic crisis was such that a significant increase in
poverty was unavoidable in Uruguay notwithstanding the existence o f a long-established
social safety net. Following upon three years o f recession, GDP f e l l by 11 percent in
2002. Unemployment rose to a peak o f almost 19 percent - the highest level in twenty
years - and poverty peaked at 3 1 percent in the last quarter o f 2002.
The government responded promptly and decisively to events as they unfolded
with substantial support from the international financial community. In August 2002 the
IMF, the Bank and the IDB announced that the three institutions would pledge a total o f
US$3.8 billion in support o f Uruguay. Within that envelope, the Bank was proactive in
assisting the government to adapt i t s policies and programs o f social protection. Bank
analytic work, including a report entitled “maintaining Social Equity in a Changing
Economy”, provided valuable insights and pointers for structuring government action
more effectively and efficiently. In July 2002, based in part upon that analysis, the Bank
approved a Special SAL in support o f a broad range o f government action including the
following:
0

Budget allocations for protected social programs in 2003 were to be no lower
that the 2002 budget allocation. Thereby, and end was put to the pro-cyclical
trend o f social expenditures from 1998-2001 and the social safety net was
made more effective. As a result o f this provision, the overall budget

allocation for protected social programs was completely protected although
budget execution at the individual program level was uneven. Food programs
substantially exceeded the amounts originally protected, in some cases by a
very large amount. Other programs, such as those focusing on child and
family centers f e l l slightly short o f target. The only program that was
significantly under-executed was a work-training program that appears to
have been poorly designed. However, the government introduced a program
o f cash transfers in exchange for community based work which went a long
way to achieving similar results. Further details on this and other provisions o f
the Special SAL can be found in a Memorandum o f the President
recommending release o f the second tranche

‘.

An evaluation was to be made o f national and local social protection programs
with a view to assessing their effectiveness, the targeting o f their benefits, and
the efficiency o f their procurement procedures. The evaluation o f the school
food program revealed that it covered 40 percent o f all school children and
that the coverage was concentrated at the lower levels o f family income.

Results o f the evaluation were disseminated on a government website. An
evaluation was also made o f the 2000-01 Program for Work Training. I t
revealed that the training program did not effectively help participants to find
work or increase their pay and it provided a basis for restructuring government
efforts in that direction.

All social spending on social protection programs at the national level and at
the departmental and municipal level was to be consolidated and a report
issued for the years 2000 through 2002. As a result o f this provision, reports
were issued for 2000 through 2002 and the Office o f Planning and Budget
(OPP) seized the opportunity to continue the practice o n a permanent basis.
The breadth o f the analysis has now been amplified beyond the scope
originally envisaged and results are posted on a government website.
An interconnected database o f beneficiaries was to be established so that
information could be cross-checked between different programs o f social
protection. The data base was effectively established and the OPP now
administers it using national identity cards to identify individual beneficiaries.

A new unemployment insurance law was to be enacted to limit the period o f
eligibility for unemployment benefits and to restrict eligibility to workers who
had not received generous severance payments. In the event, however, there
was insufficient Congressional support to change unemployment legislation in
a election year. Nevertheless, the government took steps to better enforce
existing restrictions and it thereby reduced the average length o f time that
workers were eligible for unemployment benefit. With the onset o f a strong
economic recovery, the need for unemployment insurance reform has abated
somewhat. The Board agreed to a waiver o n this condition for purposes o f
releasing a second tranche o f the Special SAL.
Training for the unemployed was to be restricted to workers who receive
severance payments less than one hundred minimum wages. After further
research, however, it was discovered that virtually all trainees had received
severance payments below the threshold and there was no need to refocus the
program. Recently-introduced community and neighborhood work programs
have been effective in reaching heads o f poor households as intended.

In 2003 the government took additional measures to protect and consolidate the
advances already achieved in education and health and received financial support for
those efforts from the Bank in the context o f a second Special S A L that was to be
disbursed in three tranches. To better reflect its scope and content, the operation was
given the more expansive formal title o f a “Public Services and Social Sectors Special
SAL”. As far as education was concerned, the second Special S A L was supportive o f a
government undertaking to provide adequate and agreed levels o f budgetary support for
(a) basic school supplies and maintenance, (b) the bilingual education program and (c)
textbooks for primary schools. Thereby, the ongoing Second Basic Education Quality

Annex 1
Page 12 o f 27

Improvement Project would be assured o f sufficient funding to fulfill its objectives.
Supervision of the Public Services and Social Sectors Special SAL in December 2004
found that “budget expenditures in the agreed programs proceeded during 2003 as
expected. The executed budget for schools operation and management was more than
twice the agreed figure, while the executed budget for bilingual educations and schools
didactic material was in line with the agreed figures.”’
In the health sector, where the Health Sector Development Project had been
closed the previous year, the second Special SAL supported government efforts to press
forward with i t s reform agenda. Specific reforms supported by the second Special SAL
focused upon improving the financial situation o f public hospitals by establishing
information systems and administrative procedures that would enable them to obtain
payments due from medical insurance companies. In addition, the financial situation o f
the FNR, a national fund that finances complex medical procedures, was to be better
secured by defining more clearly the scope o f i t s responsibilities and by estimating more
accurately the cost o f medical procedures. Loan supervision indicates that “there has been
an impressive improvement o f the FRN”. Beneficiary identification from the uninsured
population reached 50 percent in June 2004 compared with a target o f 40 percent.6

Progress with respect to the education sector and health sector reforms supported
by the second Special SAL was very good and, on that basis, the second and third
tranches were ready for release in 2004. However, when the second Special SAL was
approved in 2003, a decision was made to cross-link the release o f the second and third
tranches with the corresponding tranches o f a second SAL that had received Board
approval o n the same date. Progress with the second SAL was much slower than had
been anticipated and, because of the cross-linkage, release o f the second and third
tranches o f the second Special SAL was held-up. By 2005, it became clear that Uruguay
had already emerged from the economic crisis and further financial assistance o n Special
SAL terms was no longer appropriate. That prompted the government to request
cancellation o f the undisbursed tranches o f the Special SAL. Following the cancellation,
a new CAS would propose other more appropriate modalities for supporting the
government’s program o f social development.
In conclusion it i s clear that, at the depth o f the economic crisis, poverty outcomes
were much worse than had been envisaged at the time o f the 2000 CAS or even at the
time o f the 2002 CAS Update. However, in the case o f a small country such as Uruguay,
which i s heavily dependent upon its two large neighbors, it is reasonable to attribute the
negative outcome to force majeure. Notwithstanding the much vaunted reputation o f
Uruguay’s social safety net, it was insufficient to handle effectively the huge increase in
poverty provoked by the crisis. At best, it was able to cushion the impact o f poverty at
the margin.

Nevertheless, the response of the authorities was prompt and purposeful. That
owes much to the stability of the political system and to a well-established tradition o f
See ImplementationStatus Report (ISR) 04 dated 12/01/2004

Annex 1
Page 13 o f 27

government by consensus. I t was clearly understood that the most effective way o f
reducing poverty was to get the economy back on its feet again. Macroeconomic policy
was, therefore, at the forefront o f the fight against poverty and it was strikingly successful
in reversing the economic decline and fostering a rapid recovery. GDP grew at 11
percent in 2004. At the same time, measures were taken to strengthen programs o f social
protection and to ensure that other social programs in health and education were shielded
from fiscal retrenchment to the extent possible. The Bank, in conjunction with i t s
partners the IMF and the IDB effectively supported the government’s program for
economic recovery and poverty reduction and quickly saw the need to re-engage with an
accelerated program o f lending together with analytic and advisory work.
Pillar 2: Environmental and natural resource management was the pillar
most deeply affected by the crisis for two reasons. First, the government’s attention was
focused sharply upon managing short term issues o f stabilization and poverty relief.
Acute fiscal constrains stood in the way o f funding longer-term projects such as the
maritime management project that had been contemplated in the 2000 CAS program and
it was shelved mid-way through project preparation. Ongoing projects continued to be
implementedbut were delayed by the crisis.

A Natural Resources Management and Irrigation Development Project, begun in
1994 was already well on the way to completion by the time o f the 2000 CAS but the
final two years o f project implementation prior to the end-2002 closing date were
important for the sustainability o f the principal project objective which was to develop
and implement a soil and water management strategy focused on the development o f
irrigation with the intention o f increasing, diversifying and sustaining agricultural output
and exports. The project overall was successful, and substantial progress was made
towards achieving the principal and subsidiary development objective^.^

A second event which radically changed the focus o f the environmental and
natural resource management CAS pillar was the outbreak o f a virulent epidemic o f foot
and mouth disease (aftosa) which threatened the production and export o f beef. Given
the importance o f beef exports for Uruguay, the epidemic was a calamity that required an
urgent response. Bank support for the government’s efforts at short-term epidemiological
containment and at longer-term monitoring, surveillance and control took the form o f an
EPL in the amount o f US$18.5 million which i s s t i l l ongoing. Epidemiological
containment through vaccination was thorough and successful and the operation i s now
focusing upon monitoring, surveillance and control systems.*

The Bank has also been active in broader efforts to improve the environment by
administering GEF grants aimed at fostering alternative energy initiatives. An initial
operation to capture methane that would otherwise be emitted from landfill waste and to
harness it for the production o f electric power has been successfully implemented and has
excited the interest o f municipal authorities throughout the country.

Annex 1
Page 14 o f 27

Pillar 3: T h e role o f the state as an engine o f growth was an important focus o f
government action and o f Bank support for structural and policy reform throughout the
entire five year period o f the CAS. However, the onset o f a deep economic crisis in 2002
caused both the government and the Bank to reassess both the priorities and the
modalities.

At the beginning o f the CAS period and prior to the crisis, the Bank lending
program was designed along lines that reflected continuity. A single tranche financial
sector adjustment loan in support o f already completed government reforms to increase
efficiency and competitiveness in the financial sector was disbursed a few weeks after the
incoming Batlle administration took office in March 2000. Shortly afterwards, the Bank
submitted to the government analytic work which contained a broad range o f
recommendations for follow-up reforms to further strengthen the financial sector.
Infrastructure and public services, which are largely in the hands o f the state, also
received Bank support. In June 2000, building upon a long-standing operational presence
on the part o f the Bank, an Adaptable Program Loan was approved in support o f a
program o f modernization and systems rehabilitation in water and sewerage. The
progress o f this operation was set back by the economic crisis o f 2002 which negatively
affected the financial position o f OSE, the water and sewerage authority. Since then,
however, the situation has since improved and the operation i s progressing well. I t i s
likely that all the original objectives will be met by the time the loan closes in June, 2006
and i t i s anticipated that subsequent APLs will build upon the results achieved.’
Transport had been a major focus o f Bank support for infrastructure development
in Uruguay and i t continued to receive attention during the 2000 CAS period. The
implementation o f a Second Transport Project, approved in 1998, was made increasingly
difficult by the recession of 1999 and the crisis o f 2002 because the road sector budget
was cut back severely. Nevertheless, the Implementation Completion Report was able to

record a satisfactory outcome despite delays provoked by budget constraints. The
operation increased efficiency in transport service and road maintenance and “thereby
contributed to the rationalization o f transport sector expenditures. I t also removed some
o f the bottlenecks to international transport and contributed to the preservation o f the
road network, thus providing some o f the necessary conditions for the competitiveness o f
Uruguay’s products to increase, especially within Mercosur”. lo

Bank analytic work indicated that all infrastructure and public services, including
water supply and sanitation, power, natural gas, petroleum products, railways,
telecommunications and postal services, confronted similar issues o f organization,
management, regulation, tariff structures and information systems. The resolution o f
those issues frequently depended upon the outcome o f surveys and analytic studies which
sometimes could be complex. Technical assistance for that endeavor was furnished with
Bank support under a Public Services Modernization Technical Assistance Project that

was approved in March 2001. The project i s progressing well and it has already helped
the government achieve significant improvements in the efficiency o f state-owned
infrastructure and public services. l1
“Business as usual” was abruptly interrupted at the end o f 2001 when neighboring
Argentina devalued the Argentine peso to one third o f its previous value and defaulted on
its public debt. The ensuing crisis in Argentina quickly spilled over into Uruguay with
Argentine nationals withdrawing their deposits from Uruguayan banks en masse.
As already discussed in the sections above, the Bank chose structural adjustment
lending as the preferred vehicle for Bank support. Already, on August 8, 2002, prior to
the joint statement, the Board had approved a SAL in the amount o f US$151.5 million
and a Special SAL in the amount o f US$101 million. Those two loans were to be
followed by a second SAL and a second Special SAL in the same amounts and approved
in April 2003.

Both the SAL and the Special SAL o f 2002 were fully disbursed in two tranches
upon the satisfactory completion o f the agreed action programs. The SAL supported
macroeconomic and fiscal actions centered on restraining public sector wages. In
addition, the system of social protection was to be strengthened and protected along the
lines already discussed above in the section on Pillar 1. The Special SAL focused more
specifically on support for restructuring the National Mortgage Bank (BHU) as part o f a
broader banking system reform that was also receiving support from the IMF.
Compliance with the conditions o f the Special SAL was satisfactory overall.12
Legislation was successfully enacted to restructure the BHU and the BHU adopted and
implemented a restructuring plan. Changes were made in the powers o f the Central Bank
to remove the special privileges o f the BHU with respect to prudential regulation.
Deposits from the general public unrelated to the housing programs o f the BHU were
phased out on schedule. A due diligence valuation and appraisal o f BNH portfolio assets
was carried out. A plan for divesting BNH o f its non-performing portfolio was prepared
and approved by the Board o f Directors. The Board o f Directors likewise approved a
new credit manual for BHN.

A second SAL, approved in 2003, was entitled a “Public Services and Social
Sectors SAL” to reflect i t s content. The overall objective o f the loan was to boost
competitiveness and economic growth through the better provision o f public and social
services and infrastructure. To that end, a broad range o f structural and policy reforms
were identified with respect to infrastructure and public services. In the run-up to
national elections in 2004 the main focus o f attention was in the political arena and the
incentive to press ahead with structural reforms was diminished.
The second SAL has been much slower to move forward. Two incidents, in
particular, caused the government to hesitate. The first related to OSE, the state-owned

company for water and sewerage which has had a long-standing problem o f unaccountedfor water. A condition o f the second SAL was that OSE should contract consultants to
study the problem and recommend ways to resolve it. Labor unions opposed that
proposal and lobbied successfully for a constitutional amendment to forbid private
participation in the water supply and sanitation sector.

A second setback for the government related t o ANCAP, the state-owned
petroleum company. The second SAL supported the enactment o f a sector law defining a
broad range o f governance and regulatory issues with respect to the petroleum sector.
One provision o f the l a w enabled ANCAP to j o i n with private sector entities in
partnership arrangements. Again, labor unions registered their disapproval and lobbied
successfully for a referendum which repealed the l a w in its entirety. That was a
particularly serious setback because it has made it difficult for the government to address
the whole issue o f market liberalization and improved competitiveness within the
petroleum sector for fear o f being perceived as flouting the popular will.

As far as other conditions o f the second S A L are concerned, prospects are mixed
that they will be fulfilled and it may take time for the new administration to get
parliamentary approval where that i s needed.13 As o f February 2005, only one o f the
eleven conditions for release o f the second tranche had been fulfilled but discussions with
the incoming administration give cause for optimism that progress will be resumed when
the new administration settles in. However, it appears that the government and the Bank
may need to agree o n other strategies for increased competitiveness that do not directly
involve private sector participation in the petroleum and water supply sectors as
originally envisaged under the second SAL.

Over and beyond the operational context o f structural adjustment lending, the
Bank has recently completed a study o n the Sources o f Growth which has reinforced its
economic dialogue with the government o f Uruguay. The government has received the
study with interest. I t i s anticipated that the study will establish a solid foundation for
further discussions concerning policy and structural reforms for sustained growth and
poverty reduction.

The Bank Contribution
In Attachment 1 the results o f the 2000 CAS and the 2002 C A S Progress Report
are summarized in a matrix format for each o f the three pillars o f Bank assistance. A
comparison o f programmed and actual AAA, and programmed and actual lending i s set
out in Attachments 2 and 3 respectively.

Although the Bank was not the principal source o f multilateral assistance for
Uruguay during the period covered by the 2000 CAS, it nevertheless made a significant
contribution t o advancing the government’s program both with respect t o long-term
development objectives and with respect to shorter-term issues o f stabilization and crisis
l3See ImplementationStatus Report (ISR) No.

Annex 1
Page 17 o f 27

management. In terms o f the longer-term development effort, the 2002 crisis caused
interruptions and delays in the progress o f Bank supported investment operations but it
did not de-rail the program. Project implementation and analytic work continued to move
forward as indicated in the preceding sections on each o f the three pillars. In addition, the
conditionality attached to quick disbursing adjustment lending at the time o f the crisis
was designed to be supportive o f longer term-development goals, particularly in the areas
o f social protection, public enterprise reform and governance. Hence, as a result o f the
Bank presence, the government did not lose sight o f the longer-term perspective,
notwithstanding i t s preoccupation with crisis management.
Adjustment lending provided much-needed additional financial support and, at the
same time, helped the government to address newly-exposed structural weaknesses that
had not received full recognition prior to the crisis itself. In particular, a currency
mismatch between the assets and liabilities o f the banking system was shown to be an
important source o f vulnerability. In that context, Bank-support reform o f the National
Mortgage Bank (BNH) furnished by structural adjustment lending will both improve
financial sector efficiency and provide a much more secure foundation for housing
policies, including the provision o f low-cost housing for the poor.

The Bank was very active with analytic and advisory work throughout the 2000
CAS period. A major study entitled “Maintaining Social Equity in a Changing Economy”
provided an important analytic anchor which enabled the government to deal more
effectively with issues o f poverty that were provoked by the economic crisis. Once the
crisis struck, analytic and advisory work was merged with operational work in the
preparation o f two SALs and two Special SALs. Free-standing studies o f the financial
sector, trade and competitiveness were postponed because the macroeconomic
environment was in a state o f flux but they were later incorporated into a major study o f
“Sources o f Growth” (FY05) which provides a comprehensive analytic framework for
dialogue with the incoming ‘Rente Amplio ” administration. A poverty update (FY04)
also provides an important point of departure for further dialogue.
Part C - Overall Bank Performanceand Lessons Learned

When the 2000 CAS was drafted, the Bank had good reason to be satisfied with
the development progress of Uruguay. In i t s implementation review o f the previous 1997
CAS, the OED had rated the overall outcome as highly satisfactory. Structural reforms in
the financial and public sectors were judged to be satisfactory and institutional
development was rated as substantial. From that perspective the 1999 recession appeared
to be a temporary setback that did not, in itself, warrant serious concern. Longer-term
considerations appeared to suggest that Uruguay was firmly on the path towards
graduation from Bank lending.

That i s not to say that the Bank was unmindful o f possible sources o f
vulnerability. It i s noteworthy that, in a section o f the 2000 CAS entitled “Downside
Risks”, the two most important risks were stated as follows:

Annex 1
Page 18 o f 27

“The most obvious external downside risk would be a recession (or even more
severe economic crisis) in either Argentina or Brazil ”. (para. 70)

And then:
“Another potential threat is a change in Argentina that encourages Argentine
residents to withdraw their deposits in Uruguayan Banks”. (para. 71)

Both o f those risks materialized to the great detriment o f Uruguay. Clearly, the
Bank understood the likely serious consequences o f an economic crisis in Argentina and
the equally serious consequences o f a run on Uruguayan Bank deposits.
Yet,
nonetheless, the executive summary o f the 2000 CAS referred to “Uruguay’s relatively
modest vulnerability to external shocks” as justification for a lower program o f Bank
lending and the concluding paragraph o f the 2000 CAS opened with the comforting
assurance that:
“ I n relative terms, there are few risks associated with the Bank’s operations in
Uruguay ’’. (para. 123)

The Bank was not alone in underestimating the likely prospect o f an impending
crisis. In March 2001, an IMF review o f recent economic developments in Uruguay
began by asserting that “The Uruguayan economy is gradually emergingfrom the 19992000 recession”. As late as October 2001, in a second review o f a Stand-By arrangement,
the IMF was s t i l l o f the opinion that “the economy is adjusting but output is not expected
to pick up until 2002 ” (page 3 o f the executive summary).
The experience o f the 2000 Uruguay CAS contains, therefore, some important
lessons for country risk assessment, I t i s one thing to simply acknowledge the presence
o f risks. It i s quite another thing to assess the probability attached to those risks. There
are many possible reasons why the CAS failed to acknowledge how close Uruguay was
to the brink. It may be that, in 2000, the Bank regarded the likelihood o f an economic
crisis in Argentina to be remote. There may have been a reluctance to step out o f line
with the opinion o f other international financial institutions such as the IMF. Or, the
Bank may have been reluctant to flag the prospect o f an impending economic crisis in
Argentina for fear o f invoking a self-fulfilling prophesy and/or incurring the displeasure
o f the government. Clearly, in such situations, the Bank has to weigh i t s response, taking
into account many different factors. A lesson to be learned from the experience o f the
2000 Uruguay CAS i s that the Bank, in addition to identifying possible sources o f
risk, needs to assess the probability that the risk will materialize.
Consistent with normal Bank practice, the 2000 CAS made references to a high
case and a low case program o f Bank operations depending upon country performance. It
i s noteworthy, however, that, although the 2000 CAS acknowledged the catastrophic risk
of a possible economic crisis in Argentina, it made no proposal as to how the Bank might
respond to such a dire eventuality. In the absence o f a pre-considered country-specific

Annex 1
Page 19 o f 27

plan, a standard Bank-wide instrument - the Special S A L - was invoked to deal with the
crisis when it arose. While the Special SAL provided effective sort-term relief for
Uruguay it also created a medium-term payments problem. A lesson to b e learned i s
that, in circumstances where there i s a clear and present danger o f a catastrophic
risk, the C A S should propose contingency plans for dealing with the risk in a
manner appropriate to the country situation.
Once the crisis broke out, the Bank was able to respond quickly and effectively.
In part that was possible because the Bank had already assembled a broad body o f
country experience through a diverse operational program and through extensive analytic
work. The country knowledge and experience gained from an active and long-standing
country program could be mobilized quickly to assemble an emergency program o f
support for crisis management. At the same time, a broad and deep country dialogue
over many years, not only with the government, but also with the private sector,
academia and c i v i l society was instrumental in fostering an effective partnership with the
client. Another lesson to b e learned, therefore, i s that a strong corpus o f country
knowledge and a strong client relationship i s a necessary prerequisite for the
effective delivery o f emergency Bank assistance.

Bank assistance for crisis management in Uruguay was part o f a concerted effort
with other international financial institutions. The Bank alone would not have been able
to manage the task. Another lesson to b e learned, therefore, i s the need to maintain
and sustain close cooperation between donors.

Public Debt Sustainability

Under the base case macroeconomic scenario, the debt o f the public sector o f
Uruguay as a share o f GDP i s projected to decline gradually over time. This outcome
hinges on a number o f assumptions, including sustained good fiscal performance and
implementation o f structural reforms to underpin fiscal performance and foster economic
well as the absence o f new large external shocks. Under the base case
growth-as
assumptions, the public debt i s projected to fall from 92 percent o f GDP in 2004 to 60
percent o f GDP by 2010 (Table 2).
Three key factors underpinning debt sustainability are economic growth, fiscal
policy, and the real exchange rate. Growth improves debt sustainability by increasing
resources available to finance the public debt. Fiscal policy, in particular a significant
primary surplus, contributes directly to debt sustainability by reducing the Government’s
borrowing requirement. Achieving the primary surplus target will hinge on structural
reforms in tax, pensions, health, and state modernization, as well as in infrastructure and
public services to support private sector participation-thereby reducing pressure on the
public investment budget. Debt sustainability in Uruguay i s sensitive to the path o f the
real exchange rate given the large share o f public debt denominated in foreign currency.
As demonstrated by the crisis, a sharp drop in the value o f the peso can dramatically
increase the domestic currency value o f Uruguay’s external debt. Under the base case,
the peso i s projected to appreciate moderately in line with sustained economic recovery.
However, this will depend not only on credible macroeconomic policies but also on
structural reforms to improve the investment climate, thereby attracting capital inflows.
Finally, debt sustainability also hinges on continued support from the international
financial institutions and access to financial markets at interest rates commensurate with
economic growth proposals.
Fiscal discipline i s a major pillar required for debt sustainability. In the base case
it i s assumed that the primary surplus remains in the range o f the 3.8 percent o f GDP
level attained in 2004. The Government program includes measures to improve revenues,
in particular the increase o f the VAT base, reduction o f the rate o f evasion in social
security contributions, and the inclusion o f a new personal income tax and elimination o f
some distortionary taxes. In addition, the new Government has expressed i t s commitment
to keeping expenditures under control. The fiscal projections under base case
assumptions assume a modest recovery in wages and pensions from very l o w levels after
the 2002 crisis, followed by stabilization as a share o f GDP. Finally, the base scenario
includes an increase in capital expenditures, also recovering from very l o w levels (Table
1). Overall, medium term primary expenditure i s projected to remain well below peak
levels o f 200 1-02 under the assumption that the Government implements significant
reforms to improve contain expenditure growth. Under the base case scenario, fiscal
reforms on both the revenue and expenditure side allow for increases in expenditures as a
percent o f GDP in parallel with the economic recovery, while maintaining the primary

Annex 2
Page 2 o f 10

surplus in the target range. Were the revenue increases to generate a lower yield than
projected under the base case, then expenditures would need to be tightened in order to
maintain the primary surplus.

A second pillar for debt sustainability i s GDP growth.
In the base
macroeconomic scenario, it i s assumed that real GDP growth in 2005 i s 6 percent,
gradually declining to 3 percent by 2008 and remaining at that level thereafter. This
growth rate i s higher than average historical levels o f about 2 percent (average growth
through 1965-2004). The 3 percent medium term growth i s based on a combination o f
factors: (a) GDP growth rates higher than those projected have been observed in the past
(Figure 1); (b) higher than historical growth rates reflect a cyclical convergence out o f the
deep recession in 2002; (c) projected investment rates are higher than historical in the
base case by about 2.5-3 percentage points o f GDP (the average investment to GDP ratio
in 1990-2000 was 15 percent); and (d) successful implementation o f structural reforms as

Annex 2

outlined in the Development Challenges section o f the CAS which could provide
significant upward GDP growth potential.

The third pillar i s real exchange rate and price stability. Projections under the
base scenario are based on the assumption that domestic inflation remains low,
converging to international levels by 2007. As a result, there i s a modest projected real
exchange rate (FER) appreciation from end-2004 relative prices. Under this scenario, the
real exchange rate would stabilize in an intermediate range between the level o f the 1980s
and the level o f the 1990s (Figure 2). The real exchange rate i s critical to debt
sustainability in Uruguay given the large share o f public debt denominated in foreign
currency. This share was 90 percent as o f December 2004.

A fourth pillar i s sustained Government access to financial markets at interest
rates commensurate with economic growth prospects. This i s a very important
assumption, as it i s possible that even if the Government continues with prudent fiscal
and monetary policies and commits to structural reforms, exogenous developments in
international financial markets may disrupt access to financing. In the base scenario, it i s

assumed that international spreads for Uruguay remain at 400 basis points (the level o f
March 2005). This assumption i s based on the combination o f the following two factors:
(a) projected increases in international interest rates (from 2 percent in 2004 gradually
increasing to reach 4.5 percent in 2008), a factor that would tend to increase the spread;
and (b) the anticipated improvement in creditworthiness o f Uruguay in the base case, a
factor that would tend to reduce spreads. Therefore, the assumption o f a 400 basis points
spread through the projected period implicitly assumes that the two factors offset each
other.
In the base scenario, gross financing needs (interest plus amortization payments)
in 2005 are estimated at US$2.1 billion. Amortization payments due are U S $ l . l billion,
o f which the most important are US$0.5 billion to the IMF, US$0.2 billion in bonds,
US$0.2 billion to IDB and US$O.l billion to the World Bank (Table 2). Peaks in
financing needs occur in 2006 (US$ 2.6 billion) and 2007 (US$2.3 billion), largely
related to repayments to the IMF, and also to a peak in bonds repayments in 2006. In the

Annex 2
Page 5 o f 10

base scenario, consistency o f the financing projection requires that the Government issues
bonds for about U S 0 . 5 billion per year on average through 2005-10. This requirement
results from the following financing assumptions: (i)the IMF gradually reduces i t s
exposure in Uruguay under a new program, (ii)
the World Bank lending strategy evolves
according to the base case lending program envisaged in the CAS, and (iii)
the IADB
maintains i t s exposure broadly constant. In addition, it i s assumed that the Government
recovers assets from the Stability Fund for a total o f US$400 million during 2005-7. This
fund was created to support the financial sector during the banking crisis o f 2002.

Sensitivity Analysis

The public debt path projected in the base scenario i s sensitive to the primary
surplus, growth, and real exchange rate assumptions. Table 3 shows the effect o f
deviations in the core macroeconomic assumptions on debt sustainability indicators.
Changes in assumptions are taken one at a time, and all other assumptions remain as in
the base case.
The top section o f Table 3 shows the debt sustainability indicators under the base
scenario assumptions, and presents a summary o f the core assumptions driving the result.
The second section shows sensitivity to deviations in the primary surplus target. For
example, if the primary surplus were reduced to 3 percent o f GDP starting in 2005, the
public debt to GDP ratio would s t i l l decline but at a slower rate than under the base case,
reaching about 67 percent by 2010, that is, 7 percentage points more than under base case
assumptions.

Increasing growth rates by one percentage point starting in 2006 results in a
decline in the debt ratio to 56 percent by 2010. An equivalent one percentage point
reduction in the growth rate results in a debt ratio o f 64 percent in 2010. This result i s
important because it highlights that Uruguay’s public sector debt would likely remain on
a declining path even with a slowdown in growth performance, provided fiscal discipline
i s maintained and the growth slowdown i s limited.
The base case results are quite sensitive to changes in the projected real exchange
rate path. If the real exchange rate were to converge to more appreciated levels observed
during the 1990s, then the debt ratio would decline to a projected 51 percent by 2010.
This improvement i s explained not only by the fact that 90 percent o f debt i s
denominated in foreign currency, but also because the projected primary surpluses as
measured in dollars are much larger, reducing the need to issue debt for financing
purposes. On the other hand, if the real exchange rate were to remain at the levels o f end
2004, then the debt to GDP ratio would decline much more slowly than under the base
case, reaching a projected level of 72 percent by 2010. The 2004 real exchange rate i s
highly depreciated by historical standards and there are grounds to expect economic
recovery to be accompanied by moderate real exchange rate appreciation as under the
base case.
Sovereign spread i s not a factor to which the base scenario results are highly
sensitive. This i s because the interest spread only affects new debt issues. Therefore, it
takes several years before a given change in spreads fully translates in a change in the
average interest rate on public debt. An increase in sovereign spreads to 600 basis points
(200 basis points higher than the base case) would result in a projected debt to GDP ratio
in 2010 less than one percentage point higher than the base case. On the other hand, a
spread o f 200 basis points results in a projected debt to GDP ratio marginally below 60
percent in 2010, almost the same as in the base case. This l o w spread could be possible
in a scenario in which sustained fiscal discipline enables Uruguay to regain i t s investment
grade status.

High and Low Case Scenarios

This section presents debt sustainability prospects resulting from combining the
above deviations from the base case in an economically consistent direction (Figure 3).
The high case scenario combines the assumptions o f higher growth rate, converging to 4
percent o f GDP, primary surplus remaining at the base case level, a real exchange rate
converging to more appreciated levels, and sovereign spreads at 200 basis points. The
results are presented in the top panel o f Table 4. In the high scenario, the projected debt
to GDP ratio would decline to 48 percent in 2010, and all debt sustainability indicators
would show significant improvements.

In a l o w scenario, the projected public debt would remain in the range o f 84
percent by 20 10. This scenario combines the assumptions o f GDP growth rate converging
to 2 percent, the real exchange rate remaining at the level o f 2004, primary surplus at 3
percent o f GDP and sovereign spreads at 600 basis points. This scenario highlights the
vulnerabilities o f public sector finances o f Uruguay. For example, if the primary surplus
were to fall to 2 percent o f GDP, with all other assumptions as in the l o w scenario,
projected public debt as a share o f GDP would start to increase in 2008, reaching about
91 percent in 2010 (Table 5).

Uruguay Sources o f Growth’
Broad-based growth i s defined as growth with wide social participation in both the
production o f output and the distribution of the benefits. The policy and reform options proposed
highlight the importance o f social participation in the growth strategy. First, an attempt has been made to
evaluate the impact o f key policies and reforms on poverty and welfare. For example, increased
competition in infrastructure can lead to higher real wages; while reducing bureaucratic obstacles and
improving the incentive framework in the labor market can encourage business to create jobs; and pension
reform proposals can improve inter-generational equity. Second, health and education policies--which have
an impact o n the development o f human capital--constitute an integral part o f the growth agenda. Third,
proposals to reformulate the social safety net take into account the important changes that have occurred in
the productive structure-including the rising share o f uncovered informal workers and self-employed.
The growth strategy proposed envisages three pillars corresponding broadly with policies
and reforms to consolidate macroeconomic and financial stability (Pillar l),
improve the investment
climate (Pillar 2), and modernize the State to support the private sector and innovation (Pillar 3). In
general, benefits from policies based on pillars 1, 2 and 3 are expected to materialize in the short, medium
and long term, respectively, but there are exceptions to this generalized timeframe. For example,
macroeconomic and financial stability i s an essential requirement for all time periods. Microeconomic
policies aimed at improving the investment climate are relevant even in the short term. Innovation policies,
which by their institutional nature require a long implementation, are a priority for the short term.
The first pillar involves policies to underpin fiscal and financial stability, the efficient
operation o f factor markets (capital and labor), and the strengthening o f social protection. Such
policies can help consolidate economic recovery and alleviate the social situation o f vulnerable groups by
making use o f idle capacity and reallocating factors o f production towards more productive companies and
sectors, Improved allocative eficiency of existingfactors ofproduction is expected to be the main driver oj
productivity and growth over the short term.

The second pillar encompasses policies and reforms aimed to establish an investment climate
favorable to the accumulation o f physical and human capital; this includes trade and integration
policies, the development o f a competition framework--particularly in infrastructure; as well as
policies in education and health to promote human capital formation. Trade integration--both within
and beyond M E R C O S U R - c a n play a particularly important role in the process o f expanding export
markets, investment and growth. T h e benefits o f trade can be enhanced by improvements in the efficiency
o f infrastructure services achieved through increased competition and private sector participation to
increase Uruguay’s global competitiveness. The second pillar also encompasses institutional and policy
reforms and investments to improve the quality, efficiency and equity o f access to health and education.
The accumulation of physical and human capital combined with technical and allocative eficiency gains
are expected to be the drivers of growth in the medium term.

The third pillar comprises policies and reforms to promote growth driven by innovation;
this envisages a thorough transformation of institutional capabilities, entrepreneurial culture and the
national system o f innovation. Initial benefits o f microeconomic reforms included under this pillar--e.g.,
deregulation and bankruptcy- could begin to materialize in the short-term. Other reforms imply more
profound institutional transformations--e.g., civil service reform, strategic budget planning, and
development o f a national innovation system. The benefits o f these reforms are therefore more likely to
emerge over the medium to long term, with the time lag depending on the commitment and perseverance
with which the program i s implemented. Although innovation policies can lead to increasedproductivity in
the short term, it is likely that the full benefits will materialize only in the long term; given long gestatiol;
lam. vrioritv should be granted to the vursuit o f innovation volicies now.
Based on the report “Uruguay - Sources o f Growth - Policies for Human Capital Development,
Integration, Competition and Innovation”, World Bank, March, 2005.

URUGUAY
CLIENT SURVEY
Methodoloev
To better understand the development challenges and opportunities in Uruguay, the Bank
commissioned a comprehensive client survey o f i t s primary interlocutors and other
stakeholders from across Uruguayan society. In addition to generating interesting
information o n h o w respondents viewed the overall situation in Uruguay and the
country’s place in the international community, the survey provides important data on
h o w the Bank’s most important partners perceive i t s role, relevance and effectiveness.
The objective has been to use these data-and the perspective-provided by the survey to
help the Bank improve the support it provides to Uruguay.
The Survey was conducted in June and July 2004. A total o f 256 potential respondents
were asked t o answer a set o f some 25 questions. O f this, 205, or 80 percent, agreed to
complete the survey and submit their responses by mail. Participants were drawn from
the various levels o f government, members o f Parliament, agencies implementing Bank
projects, partner bilateral and multilateral agencies, the private sector and c i v i l society,
media and academia. The majority o f respondents, equaling some 25 percent o f the total,
were from the private sector, followed by academics and then by representatives from
federal, regional and local government. As is typical for such surveys, there was
significant variation with respect to the respondents’ knowledge o f the Bank’s operations.
Some had little or no direct involvement with the Bank, while more than h a l f indicated
that they have been involved with or a close observer o f World Bank activities for more
than three years.

Kev Findings
The following is a synopsis and seeks to provide an overview o f the main findings o f
what is a comprehensive and detailed questionnaire. The first part o f the survey was
dedicated to establishing a general sense o f h o w the respondents viewed the overall
condition o f Uruguay. More than 60 percent o f respondents answered that the country
was “heading in the right direction,” with solid majorities believing good progress was
being made in ensuring broad access t o education and sustaining the economic recovery.
Less favorable progress was seen in the areas o f health and overall public service delivery
to the poor. Nevertheless, a strong majority o f respondents were at least “optimistic”
about Uruguay’s future. These findings are interesting, as they reflect the mood o f at
least part o f the electorate three months before a close election that resulted in a change
o f Government.
Respondents across the Board believe that Uruguay should maintain its active
participation in the international financial community. Some 97 percent indicated that
the country should receive “at the least the same as or more assistance f r o m external
sources” to address key challenges-with more than 50 percent indicating that more was
needed, O n what that support should be focused, nearly h a l f indicated that reducing

Annex 5
Page 2 o f 3

poverty (26%) and generating employment (21%) were the most critical challenges
facing Uruguay. Improving the business climate, strengthening the economy and
improving government effectiveness followed. These five areas together accounted for
nearly 90 percent o f the “most important” responses.

The World Bank
Regarding the World Bank, 71 percent o f respondents indicated that the Bank should be
“more involved in Uruguay’s development strategies.” An additional 28 percent said the
current level was appropriate; leaving only 1 percent o f a l l respondents saying the Bank
should be less involved in Uruguay. In terms o f where the Bank could make the greatest
contribution, the strongest responses centered o n supporting economic growth and
poverty reduction, with some interesting differences among stakeholders groups.
Respondents from the private sector, for example, rated helping to create employment
opportunities for the poor as the most important area for Bank involvement, while c i v i l
society organizations believed the Bank’s focus should be o n strengthening the financial
system. For their part, government officials from both the central and regional level
identified the Bank’s role in improving the efficiency o f the public sector as paramount.
These are notable findings and suggest the sophistication o f the various stakeholder
groups in Uruguay.
There were other interesting findings about where respondents saw the Bank’s greatest
value-added. Nearly 60 percent of respondents thought investment lending to finance
development projects was the Bank’s most effective means o f support, while just under a
quarter thought providing lending to promote policy reform was most important. This
corresponded fairly closely with a separate question o n the greatest challenges for the
Bank, with some 33 percent o f respondents finding that the Bank’s development policy
lending should better reflect the political realities o f the country, and another 24 percent
feeling that the Bank should be more open to alternative policy options. At the same
time, o n a personal level, the Bank has clearly established good relations with Uruguay,
with all respondents indicating that the Bank treats clients and stakeholders with respect,
and that staff are straightforward and accessible.
From the Bank’s perspective, the overwhelming preference o f respondents for maintained
and stepped up support and cooperation is welcome news. The challenge ahead,
according to the survey, will be to do a better j o b ensuring greater effectiveness in those
interventions perceived as most important. A s it stands, the survey shows that there i s a
potentially troubling mismatch, with the Bank seen as more effective in areas considered
important, but of relatively less urgency (infrastructure, governance), than in those areas
more directly related to poverty reduction and social protection, where the Bank’s
involvement i s considered by the majority o f respondents t o be absolutely critical.
Perhaps this finding should n o t be surprising given the complexity o f poverty reduction
in normal times, let alone when the impact o f severe crisis is still evident and farreaching. Nevertheless, it provides a valuable guide for the Bank as it seeks to move
forward in transforming its support from crisis response to long term development.

Annex 5
Page 3 o f 3

Overall, the Bank i s perceived to be relatively effectivej though more needs to be done.
It is important t o note that the overall rating obscures important differences among the
respondent groups. Perhaps most notable, there i s a strong correlation between a
respondent’s familiarity with the Bank and h o w s/he rated i t s overall effectiveness. For
example, ratings were significantly higher than the average among respondents from
agencies that implement Bank supported projects. Conversely, respondents with the
lowest level o f familiarity with the Banl-from c i v i l society organizations, academics,
and the private sector-gave
the lowest ratings for effectiveness.
While this
demonstrates the continued need for the Bank to improve the effectiveness o f all o f its
interventions, it also suggests the need for stepped-up outreach to, and communication
with, a broader spectrum o f Uruguayan society. This particularly appears t o be the case
with the private sector, which made up a quarter o f all respondents, was near the bottom
of the scale in its familiarity with the Bank and gave overall mediocre ratings in terms o f
effectiveness.
The client survey has proved to be a helpful tool in identifying where the Bank can be
most effective in its support to the Uruguayan authorities, and has complemented the
productive meetings Bank staff and senior management held with the incoming
administration during the transition period. Indeed, it may prove useful at some point in
the future to conduct a follow-up survey with the same stakeholders in Uruguay to assess
progress in the key areas identified above.

Ministry o f Economy and Finance
Oriental Republic of Uruguay
Montevideo, M a y 4,2005
Mr. James D. Wolfensohn
President
The World Bank Group
Washington D.C.
Dear Mr. Wolfensohn:

Iam pleased to address you on behalf o f the new Government that took office in the Oriental
after having obtained the absolute majority o f votes in the first round
Republic o f Uruguay last March lst.,
o f the general elections held in October 2004. The new Government, led by our President, Dr. Tabard
Vbzquez, represents an important democratic transition and i s the result o f a deep desire o f change that
the Uruguayan people was craving for. The changes we are undertaking in a participatory way have the
consensus o f our society, as well as the diligent and enthusiastic support o f all the friends o f the country,
including the international financial institutions.
At present we are developing multi-annual cooperation programs with the World Bank, the InterAmerican Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund. In particular, we are finalizing with
the World Bank the new Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the upcoming five years, under which we
expect to define together a new assistance program for Uruguay with the institution that you represent. In
this context, we have already identified the development programs and projects with highest priority, as
well as the ongoing projects which were initiated by the former administration and that we are interested
in completing successfully.
Within this context -and as you know- on April 8*,, 2003, the World Bank Board o f Directors
approved a Structural Adjustment Loan (UR-71640) - SAL I1and a Special Structural Adjustment Loan
(UR-7 1650) - SSAL 11. These programs contain general objectives o f economic growth reactivation,
improvement o f Uruguay's economy competitiveness and improvement o f the population's general
welfare. The loans, negotiated and approved as part o f the assistance package mobilized by the
international institutions for our country in response to the serious financial crisis we faced on 2002, were
signedjointly and made effective by the parties on April 22"d, o f the same year. SAL I1focuses on
increasing efficiency in the public and infrastructure services, while SSAL I1aims to improve the impact
o f public expenditures o n the education and health sectors.
Currently, SSAL I1(Social Sectors) i s well-advanced, the financial and economic conditions in
our country have improved remarkably and Uruguay no longer Eeds the exceptional financing that was
granted at that time through special loans. Therefore, having evaluated in the light o f the present situation
the different options to complete both programs, we have decided to request the cancellation o f the total
amount o f the S S A L I1loan funds that remain undisbursed as o f the present date. Given that the country
has achieved even more ambitious goals that those agreed in the SSAL 11, we are making this request with

Annex 6
Page 6 o f 7
the conviction that we will soon finalize successfully the current negotiations in the context o f the new
CAS, which we trust will be conducive to the implementation o f a new operation in support o f our social
programs.
Regarding SAL 11(Public Services and Infrastructure) implementation, we would like to reiterate
the commitment of the Oriental Republic of Uruguay both to the general and specific objectives o f this
operation. These goals were shared by our Administration ever since the political campaign which
eventually led u s to the Presidency, given the priority we accord to reforms aimed at reducing prices,
improving quality and coverage and increasing efficiency o f investment, production and distribution o f
public and infrastructure services.

Strategy
The strategy this Government has adopted to achieve the general and specific objectives o f SAL
I1includes the implementation o f reforms directed to: first, fostering competition in the markets;
strengthening and consolidating regulatory entities, and legal and regulatory frameworks for the public
sectors and infrastructure services; strengthening the entities responsible for defining policies and
planning the development o f each sector, and clarifying the difference between the responsibilities o f
these institutions and those charged with regulatory functions.
Second, t o improve the efficiency o f public expenditures by means o f a better corporate
governance, more transparency in public operators’ administration, better definition o f obligations and
responsibilities, and a reduction o f tax distortions.

Third, to modernize public operators by strengthening and optimizing their investment, operation
and maintenance programs.
And, fourth, to review tariff structures and subsidy policies applicable to public services in order
to better complement the Government’s social policy in benefit o f the low-income population. In
particular, attempt to make these consistent among sectors and to focus them on favoring the poorest.
Specific Objectives
The main objectives we are committed to in each sub-sector are:
Energy. The commitment of achieving SAL II’s specific objectives in the upcoming nine to
twelve months is part o f our Government strategy. In the energy sector, this strategy seeks to define --in
the context o f our national policy that we are defining in a participatory and explicit way-- the
strengthening, consolidation and implementation o f the legal and regulatory frameworks of the different
energy sectors and the regulatory entity, as well as the rationalization o f tariffs and prices.

As a result of the referendum held in December 2003, there are some objectives that are more
difficult to achieve, such as those that seek to regulate importation and production o f petroleum products
and to define tariffs and access rules to Montevideo port, and to the ANCAP infrastructure facilities
located there. Since in the referendum 62 percent o f the Uruguayan population voted in favor o f the
annulment o f a law dated January 2002 that eliminated ANCAP’s monopoly o f the import, export and
refinement o f crude oil, and allowed the strategic association o f ANCAP with an international operator,
our Government now faces the challenge o f advancing by means that are compatible with the popular
will.

Annex 6
Page 7 o f 7

Potable water and sewerage. Our specific objectives in the potable water and sewerage sector
are to define and implement a legal and regulatory framework for the sector, as well as to strengthen,
consolidate and implement the regulatory entity in charge thereof.

However, as in the case o f the energy sector, in October 2004 a second referendum --approved by
two thirds o f the Uruguayan population-- amended the Constitution making potable water and sewerage
services the exclusive domain o f the public sector. In fact, this second referendum forbids not only the
participation o f the private sector through sales o f assets and concessions, but also the association o f
public companies with private f i r m s to provide these services. Also in this area -as in the energy sectorthe challenge i s to be able to advance with measures compatible with the popular will.
Communications. In this case the specific objectives are the consolidation o f the legal and
regulatory framework of the telecommunications and postal services sectors, and strengthening market
competition. We seek to strengthen the capacity o f the competent regulatory entity as well.
Transport. Finally, the specific objective in the transport sector i s to consolidate the recent
reforms and successful advances through the actions supported by SAL 11.

We are optimistic and convinced that working together with the Bank we will be able to face the
challenges involved in achieving the objectives we have set for ourselves, and to identify new goals and
instruments that will allow us to implement our strategy in the above mentioned sectors.
We are sure that only by improving competition, regulation, corporate governance, social policies
and efficiency o f operators in the public and infrastructure services sectors will it be possible to improve
in a sustainable way the country’s competitiveness, and to guarantee i t s economic growth and the welfare
o f our population.
Sincerely,

Danilo Astori
Minister o f Economy and Finance

Remarks I Explanation

Cost sharing. Limit o n
proportion o f individual project
costs that the Bank may finance.

Up to 100% o f total project costs.

Proposed flexibility w i l l be
:xercised within the Bank’s
>vera11planned country lending
:nvelope. The Bank would
Fiance projects where ownership
D f the overall program and at the
sector level i s considered
satisfactory. T h e Bank’s
Financing share in individual
projects i s expected to continue at
current levels. However, the
Bank w i l l consider financing a
higher proportion or 100% in
specific situations when this
would result in: i)substantially
reduced transactions costs; and ii)
a substantial impact on poverty
alleviation.
~

Recurrent cost financing. Any
limits that would apply to overall
amount o f recurrent expenditures
that the Bank may finance.

N o country-level limit.

~~

In determining Bank fmancing o f
recurrent costs in individual
projects, the Bank w i l l take into
account sustainability issues at
the sector and project levels.
Financing o f recurrent costs
would continue to take place in
exceptional cases, and mainly to
finance project operation costs.
Increased flexibility may be
applied if the need arises when
there are special emergency and
project circumstances. For
example, in the case o f an
emergency, the Bank would
consider financing recurrent costs
o n a temporary basis to alleviate
adverse social or human
conditions. The Bank would also
consider financing output based
contracts containing an element
o f recurrent cost financing, if
project conditions would so
require.

Annex 7

Local cost financing. Are the
requirements for Bank financing
of local expenditures met, namely

Yes.

The Bank may fmance local costs
in the proportion needed in
individual projects.

Taxes and Duties. Are there any
taxes and duties that the Bank
would not finance?

Import tariffs above 28%, i.e.
double the average o f the
MERCOSUR common external
tariff (CET) rate.

The Bank may finance all taxes
and duties associated with project
expenditures, except import
tariffs above 28%, i.e. double the
average o f the MERCOSUR
common external tariff (CET)
rate. In projects where such
tariffs are material, the
government’s financial
contribution to the project would
be at least equal to cover such
tariffs. At the project-level, the
Bank would also consider
whether taxes and duties
constitute an excessively high
share o f project’s costs.

that: (i)
financing requirements
for the country’s development
program exceed public sector’s
own resources and expected
domestic borrowing, (ii)
the
financing o f foreign expenditures
alone would not enable the Bank
to assist in the financing o f
individual projects.

Summary o f Consultationswith Civil Society
Introduction

Important activities were carried out in the period preceding CAS preparation to establish
a permanent dialogue between the Bank and Uruguayan civil society, and to ensure a
constructive feedback from various sectors o f civil society. These activities included:

The Client Survey compiled the opinions o f key actors from across the spectrum
of Government, private sector, civil society and academia on the role o f the Bank
and i t s effectiveness.
Participatory Workshops for the preparation o f the Sources o f Growth study were
attended by representatives from Government and the private sector.
The Social Monitor specifically aimed at strengthening the role o f civil society in
the development and implementation o f Bank projects and at developing social
accountability mechanisms.

Additional CAS consultations focused specifically on the future Bank assistance strategy
in Uruguay. The consultation process took place on April 19-21, 2005 in three areas o f
the country that ensured diversity and a representative picture o f the country’s reality.
The purpose o f the CAS consultations was threefold:

to consult with civil society on the blueprint o f the Country Assistance

Strategy for FY05-10 which the Bank was in the process o f discussing with
the new administration;
to obtain the views o f civil society on the Bank’s contribution to Uruguay’s
development in the recent past; and
to enlist the support o f civil society in the implementation o f the Bank
strategy, including new ways to involve civil society in the design and
implementation o f Bank-funded projects.

Consultation Process
Location: The consultations were organized by the Bank in partnership with the
Government o f Uruguay and the Foro Consultivo Econdmico Social del MERCOSUR
(FCES). Half day-long meetings were held in three locations: the capital city o f

Montevideo, Paysandu and Tacuaremb6.

Montevideo, the nation’s capital, with about 1.3 million inhabitants accounts for
more than one third o f the country’s population. I t i s the country’s political,
economic and social center.
Pavsandu, a town o f about 60,000 inhabitants in the western part o f the country,
close to the Argentine border, was selected primarily because o f its high

Page 2 o f 5

economic potential, the particularly severe impact o f the crisis on the local
economy, as well as the active role played locally by civil society organizations.
The area has suffered very high levels o f emigration and it i s struggling to attract
investment back to the agricultural sector, once the mainstay o f the economy.
0

Tacuaremb6, a rural town o f about 40,000 inhabitants in the northern part o f the
country, was selected because it i s one o f the country’s poorest areas. The local
economy, primarily based on agriculture, was severely impacted by the crisis.

Foro Consultivo Economico-Social
del M E R C O S U R (FCES)
The consultations on the Bank’s strategy were co-organized by the Foro Consultivo
Economico-Social del MERCOSUR (FCES), Seccion Uruguaya. The FCES i s a
permanent institutional structure o f MERCOSUR and has primarily a consulting role. I t
started to operate at the regional level in 1995. FCES i s structured into national chapters,
each o f which has representation from different levels o f civil society: the private sector,
the unions and NGOs. The wide variety o f its constituencies helps the FCES ensure broad
and active participation o f all sectors o f civil society. It provides an important
institutional setting for expressing concerns and for carrying out initiatives o f the various
segments o f civil society.

Participants: The meetings attracted a high number o f participants, more than 200 in
total, with a particularly strong attendance in the interior o f the country. There was strong
participation from the entire spectrum o f civil society. The consultations not only
included specialized NGOs with expertise on how the World Bank and other multilateral
financial institutions work, but also representatives from unions, faith groups, academia,
workers’ organizations, producers’ associations and the media. Government officials at
the national, departmental and local level (including the Mayors o f both Paysand6 and
Tacuaremb6) also participated in the meetings, providing a critical perspective on
important policy issues.
Documentation: Documents and pamphlets especially prepared for the consultations
include a profile o f all active projects and a summary o f the Policy Notes discussed with
the Government elect in January. These were distributed to meeting participants to
broaden public information on the Bank’s role and activities, and policy options
discussed with the administration.
Meeting Organization: All meetings were structured around a presentation explaining
briefly the role o f the Bank in Uruguay in the recent past and illustrating the main
objectives o f the proposed CAS on the basis o f the preliminary agreements reached with
the authorities. The presentation was, all in all, well received by participants and
generated very constructive and lively discussions, particularly regarding the perceived
role o f the Bank. Following the presentation, participants split into break-up working

Annex 8
Page 3 o f 5

groups and were asked t o respond to a number o f questions outlined in a questionnaire.
Attention was given t o ensure a broad representation o f c i v i l society organizations in
each o f the groups which were headed by a leader/rapporteur.
The questionnaire was intended to generate discussion and consensus among the groups
o n t w o key themes: equitable growth and the impact of the crisis on Uruguayan society.
With respect to the former, the questionnaire aimed at obtaining c i v i l society’s
perspective o n the following:
0

0
0

the challenges faced by Uruguay over the last few years in attaining the
objective o f equitable growth;
h o w the Bank has helped in addressing these challenges; and
the areas which future Bank support should focus o n in order to meet the
stated challenges.

In regard to the latter, the questions aimed at identifying:
0
0

the principal negative effects o f the crisis on Uruguayan society; and

priority actions that could contribute to alleviate these negative effects and to
promote increased wellbeing in Uruguayan society. After about an hour o f
discussion, the groups were asked to present their conclusions in a plenary.

Main Issues and Perceptions

Main Themes: The meetings at all three locations indicated a significant support for the
core principles o f the CAS, and there was a high level o f coincidence between the
challenges singled out by the break-up groups and those being identified in the CAS. The
main themes that emerged f r o m the discussion were a general appreciation o f the
country’s fiscal constraints, and particularly the need t o ensure a balance between the
demands o f the education sector, which needs additional resources, and those o f the
pension system, which continues t o place significant demands o n the state. In addition,
the need to strengthen the public sector was emphasized in the course o f the discussions.
Participants felt that meeting the main challenges identified during the consultations will
imply a major change in the attitude presently prevailing in Uruguay with respect to work
ethics, entrepreneurship, and human capital formation.

With regard to the impact o f the crisis o n Uruguayan society, c i v i l society representatives
placed special emphasis o n the costs o f the crisis in terms o f employment, particularly
vis-&vis women, the youth and other most vulnerable groups. Loss o f jobs was linked to
increased levels o f emigration which depleted the country o f qualified manpower. It was
noted that the crisis had a severely negative impact o n the country’s values, both at the
family level - leading to increased domestic violence and youth desertion, as well as the
individual level - leading t o loss o f hope, lack o f confidence in the future and risk-averse
behavior. The sense o f disillusionment was more pronounced in the t w o locations in the
interior o f the country which have been severely impacted by the crisis and where the

Annex 8
Page 4 o f 5

effects o f the crisis continue to be significant, mainly due t o the lack o f investment in the
service and productive sectors which are potential sources o f j o b creation.
Perceptions of the World Bank: Overall, participants had very limited information about
the role o f the Bank in the past. This was mainly attributed by participants to the limited
openness on the part o f previous administrations as well as the Bank, and there was a
strong claim for increased public information, a broader outreach strategy and enhanced
c i v i l society participation in the future. To this end, participants welcomed the opening o f
a World Bank representative office in Montevideo which will increase public information
o n the Bank’s programs and will enhance participation by c i v i l society in the design and
implementation o f Bank-funded projects. Government representatives also stressed the
importance o f being transparent in the implementation o f the country’s future strategy,
and indicated their openness in this regard.

A number o f perceptions about the Bank emerged forcefully throughout the consultations
with c i v i l society representatives. Participants believed that the economic growth o f the
1990s was artificial, and that it compromised many o f the traditional values o f Uruguayan
society, such as equity and solidarity. Participants attributed part o f the responsibility for
such loss o f values to the Bank, although Bank’s involvement in Uruguay during the
1990s was in fact limited. There was also a concern with the impact o f the Bank’s
assistance, as many o f the areas in which the Bank has been involved, such as education,
continue to present a challenge. However, the perception o f the Bank varied across the
three locations. W h i l e in Paysandfi participants focused o n past experiences and what
went wrong, the attitude o f participants in Montevideo and Tacuaremb6 was more
forward-looking .

Despite these difficult perceptions, there was a positive attitude towards developing a
constructive dialogue with the Bank in the future, and a positive reception by all groups
in terms o f a future expansion o f the Bank’s program in the country. Participants
welcomed the idea o f the consultations and it was clear that there was a desire from c i v i l
society to take a more pro-active role in the implementation o f the Bank’s strategy in the
future.
Proposalsfor Engagement: A number o f areas o f future Bank involvement which call
for close collaboration with c i v i l society were identified. As a matter o f priority, civil
society would welcome the opportunity for increased involvement in reconstructing those
values which are perceived t o have been lost as a result o f the crisis, and it would be a
key partner for the Government in this endeavor.

With regard to social inclusion, c i v i l society could play a major role in ensuring that the
needs o f the most vulnerable groups (including children, youth, the disabled and women)
are addressed.
The need for broader reforms in the education sector was also identified. In particular,
participants stressed that there is a need to go beyond punctual interventions and simple
pilot projects, and to elicit the active involvement o f teachers in the design o f future

reforms. Further, there i s a need to link efforts aimed at improving education with the
demands arising in the productive sector, particularly in the area o f professional training.

With respect to the productive sector, in addition to policies aimed at increasing
productivity and creating an enabling environment for the private sector, participants felt
that there i s ample scope for civil society participation in the design and implementation
of programs targeted at bolstering small and medium enterprises, micro-enterprises and
cooperatives.
Finally, in the area of state reform, participants noted that civil society could play a key
role in the monitoring of results obtained by the public sector.

Conclusion

The CAS consultations were invaluable in terms o f validating the strategy being
discussed with the new administration and in building a stronger link between the Bank
and civil society groups across the country. There was overall a strong consensus on the
proposal for an expansion o f the Bank’s role in Uruguay in the coming years and for
strong Bank support to the Government’s agenda for accelerated growth with equity. The
consultations also responded to civil society’s appetite for increased information on the
Bank’s role and programs, and demands for greater openness on the part o f Government
concerning i t s development program. The consultations provided a renewed opportunity
for a more sustained exchange o f information and interaction with civil society on the
Bank’s country assistance strategy, particularly in the design and implementation o f
future Bank projects.
