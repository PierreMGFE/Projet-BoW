PART 1: UGANDA JOINT ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
PREFACE
Uganda Joint Assistance Strategy context

Uganda, like many other countries, has experienced high transaction costs from aid, especially
when i t has been provided as uncoordinated project support. For example:
0

0

0

The Government has had to spend considerable time hosting and supervising a multitude
o f missions for each project, often scheduled to suit the timetable o f each donor rather
than o f the Government.
Aid in Uganda has often resulted in the creation o f new systems that paralleled existing
government systems. While these helped in implementing projects, they did little to
build capacity o f government.
Donors often have procedures and requirements very different from each other, putting a
strain on government staff.

Recognizing the high transaction costs, government promoted donor coordination and alignment
throughout the 1990s. This spurred the establishment o f joint sector working groups, the
development o f sectonvide approach programs ( SWAps) and pooled funding mechanisms, joint
missions, silent partnerships, and joint analytical work and advisory services by development
partners. Subsequently, the annual poverty reduction support credit (PRSC) process played an
important role in strengthening donor harmonization.' The PRSC has been a focus for donors
that provide budget support to participate injoint discussions with government and to link their
disbursements to the fulfillment o f agreed prior actions that are themselves derived from the
Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEN).

The first PRSC for Uganda was approved in May 2001.

UJAS draft.

The government laid out i t s intent for i t s relationship with donors in volume 3 o f the 2000 PEAP,
called “Building Partnerships to Implement the PEAP.” A set o f partnership principles were
signed by the government and key donors in 2003 (box 1). At the time, these were unique in
Sub-Saharan Africa in guiding donor behavior and support, in steering donor-government
cooperation, and in establishing the importance o f budget support (in contrast to a multitude o f
single, stand-alone projects) for increasing the effectiveness o f aid.

The Uganda Joint Assistance Strategy (UJAS) is a natural next step to further enhance donor
harmonization. The revision o f the PEAP by the government in 2004 provided the opportunity
for donors to develop a strategy aligned behind the government’s own development program.
The PEAP includes a detailed results and policy matrix that provides the framework for
alignment.’

The matrix will be updated periodically to reflect changes in the country context.

Uganda Joint Assistance Strategy process
T h e idea o f preparing a joint assistance strategy, first discussed in the fall o f 2003, was q u i c k l y
endorsed by several k e y donors. O n e bilateral and one multilateral partner p r o v i d e d s t a f f for the
drafting o f the document. Drafts were shared and discussed in detail with a l l UJAS partners at
various stages o f the drafting process.

In M a r c h 2004, t h e government circulated a first comprehensive draft o f t h e revised PEAP. In
July 2004, UJAS partners in a two-day w o r k s h o p discussed the k e y risks to PEAP
implementation, the general program that partners would support, and the comparative advantage
o f each UJAS partner in specific areas. In N o v e m b e r 2004, the government issued the final
PEAP. UJAS partners issued the first comprehensive draft o f the UJAS shortly thereafter. T h e
draft was further refined in meetings between t h e UJAS partners, and shared in April 2005 with
government, c i v i l society and other development partners.
T h e process presented opportunities and challenges. UJAS partners have learned important
lessons, in particular about the need for in-depth preparation to agree o n joint approaches and
expectations. T h e opportunities, challenges and lessons are summarized below.

Opportunities
0

0

0

0

The existence o f a comprehensive PEAP behind which development partners could align
their support made drafting o f the UJAS much easier. The development partners are able
to rely on the PEAP results matrix and monitoring framework to monitor implementation
o f the UJAS and evaluate i t s impact.
Recognition o f the need to harmonize i s well established. This makes further
rationalization o f roles and responsibilities easier.
The existence o f PRSCs and o f mature SWAPSin health, education, water, and other
sectors provided extensive experience with harmonization.
The Partnership Principles had been in place for more than two years.

Challenges
0

0

0

Disengaging from sectors proved difficult for many UJAS partners. The issue o f who
decides who has the comparative advantage in any given area was difficult to address. A
further challenge i s how shifts in comparative advantage over time can be
accommodated.
The need for development partners in Kampala to consult periodically with their
headquarters and to reflect different headquarter requirements constrained progress.
Different assessments o f the risks posed by corruption and the political transition created
tensions among some UJAS partners, making it difficult to draft a strategy acceptable to
all.

Lessons learned
0

0

0

The UJAS i s a process. The UJAS document i s a milestone. Progress will continue to be
made in a range o f areas during implementation.
Producing a joint strategy takes time, often much more than preparing a single agency
country assistance strategy. Agencies involved need to allocate sufficient resources to
the process. A clear management arrangement needs to be put in place. K e y issues
include identifying a leader or leaders o f the process and clarifying the expectations o f
partners involved,
Flexibility and innovation, particularly in complying with the guidelines o f headquarters,
are important.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Country context. Since 1986 economic growth in Uganda has been extraordinary and
1.
poverty has decreased substantially. Due to strong macroeconomic management (low inflation,
stable exchange rate, large foreign reserves), savings, exports, and foreign direct investment are
increasing. Within the region, Uganda has been a leader in the fight against HIV/AIDS, with
prevalence dropping significantly during the past decade. The challenge for Uganda i s now to
deepen reforms already underway and prevent their reversal. This challenge will be heightened
during the run-up to Uganda’s first multiparty election since 1980, scheduled for February or
March 2006.

..

To accelerate growth, the underpinnings o f a market economy need to be further
strengthened, exports need to be diversified, new economic opportunities have to be sought, and
more needs to be done to attract private sector investment. Concrete progress in improving
governance i s critical, and strong political will i s required to reduce corruption and levels o f
fiduciary risk. Uganda’s very high rate o f population growth poses a long-term challenge for
growth and poverty reduction. Although Uganda has made substantial progress towards
achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), more needs to be done if all are to be
met. Special efforts will be needed to improve the quality o f education services to ensure that
children complete primary education and that gender disparity in education i s eliminated.
Greater access to quality health services is also essential to significantly reduce child and
maternal mortality rates. Moreover, Uganda i s s t i l l experiencing internal violent conflict, which
presents special challenges.
11.

iii. Uganda’s Poverty Eradication Action Plan. Uganda’s development objectives are
articulated in the 2004 PEAP, the third version o f its poverty eradication action plan. The 2004
PEAP restates the country’s ambitions o f eradicating mass poverty and o f becoming a middle
income country in the next twenty years. I t argues for a shift o f policy focus from recovery to
sustainable growth and structural transformation. The PEAP presents specific policies and
measures to achieve i t s objectives, grouped under five pillars:
Economic management. The government’s strategy aims to maintain macroeconomic
(1)
stability and to promote private sector driven, export-led-growth. Measures include containing
inflation, mobilizing domestic revenue, and reducing the fiscal deficit.

(2)
Enhancing competitiveness, production and incomes. Priorities involve increasing
investment in transport infrastructure and in energy systems, deepening the financial system,
removing bureaucratic obstacles to business, promoting rural development, and improving
incentives for sustainable management o f natural resources.
Security, conflict resolution, and disaster management. K e y interventions comprise
(3)
improving the defense and police services, strengthening disaster preparedness and management
(including programs to assist refugees and internally-displaced people), and rehabilitating and
reconstructing infrastructure and livelihood systems in conflict-affected areas.

xi

Governance. The overall objective o f the pillar i s to strengthen political governance,
(4)
human rights, legal and justice systems, and public sector management and accountability.
These objectives will be achieved through measures ranging from promoting democracy to
reforming the public services.
Human resources development. Priorities include improving the quality o f education and
(5)
health services, addressing HIV/AIDS, increasing access to family planning services, and
expanding water and sanitation systems, particularly in rural communities.

A PEAP results and policy matrix sets out specific medium-tern (2007/08) and long-term
(2013/14) targets for selected outcomes under each pillar, and the critical policy actions judged
necessary to meet them.
iv.
The Uganda Joint Assistance Strategy. This Joint Assistance Strategy o f seven
development partners-African
Development Bank, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway,
Sweden, the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development, and the World Bank
Group-is centered on three principles. These are:
0

0

0

Supporting implementation o f the country-owned and led revised PEAP to achieve the
MDGs.
Collaborating more effectively, both among development partners and with the
government.
Focusing on results and outcomes (including managing resources and improving
decision-making for results, and strengthening systems for monitoring and evaluation).

Harmonization. Government promoted donor coordination and alignment throughout
the 1990s. In response, the UJAS partners have increasingly aligned their support behind the
government’s development program, with the aim o f reducing the transaction costs that
government faces in dealing with multiple development partners. Partnership Principles were
signed with the government. The UJAS partners are committed to continue the process o f
harmonization in line with these principles and the Rome and Paris declarations. They will
become increasingly selective in their programming and policy dialogue, with each concentrating
i t s efforts in line with i t s comparative advantages. I t is hoped that the government will lead the
process.
v.

The Uganda Joint Assistance Strategy program focus. UJAS partners will support the
implementation o f the PEAP in general, but will focus on certain areas judged to be especially
important for achieving the PEAP’s overarching strategic results. These areas are: (a)
strengthening the budget process and public sector management, (b) promoting private sector
development and economic growth, (c) strengthening governance, (d) improving education and
health outcomes, and (e) promoting the resolution o f the conflict in the north and fostering the
social and economic development o f the region.
vi.

vii.
Financing scenarios. The UJAS partners will finance the implementation o f the PEAP
through four main channels: direct budget and project support to the government, support to the

xii

programs o f c i v i l society organizations, assistance to the private sector, and support channeled
through U.N.agencies. Although some UJAS partners expect to deliver an increasing proportion
of their support through direct budget support, a l l will continue to provide some assistance as
project support. UJAS partners will also provide as much support as possible in the form o f
grants to enable the government to maintain public debt within levels that it can comfortably
manage. The base case scenario assumes that the government continues to successfully
implement the PEAP, and envisages the provision o f support at levels o f the recent past. Under
this scenario the partners will support operations in key areas identified in the PEAP. They will
complement these operations with analytical work and policy dialogue to build institutions and
strengthen capacity in key areas and to provide the foundation for future support.
viii.
To accelerate progress in attaining PEAP objectives and MDGs, or to assist with
rehabilitating the economy o f the north, UJAS partners will move to a high case scenario i f they
and the government agree that the country’s general conditions allow for an increase in resource
flows, and that additional resources will be used effectively to promote accelerated growth and
poverty reduction. Under this scenario, UJAS partners would be ready to support additional
public investment, especially in roads, regional infrastructure, energy, and community and rural
development projects.

ix.
A l o w case scenario would be triggered if performance in economic management
deteriorates significantly, the commitment to a pro-poor policy agenda declines, conflict within
the region resurges, or commitment to improve governance and enhance public financial
management falters. For some UJAS partners issues concerning the political transition and
human rights are also important. Some may shift to a l o w case scenario if political transition
falls short o f being free and fair or if human rights are abused. A move to a l o w case will be
gradual and follow intensive discussions with the government to ensure that core priorities o f the
PEAP are not sacrificed.
Risks. Risks to PEAP and UJAS implementation include those related to the political
x.
transition, poor governance, inadequate protection o f human rights and limited access to justice,
the continuing conflict in northern Uganda, weak public sector capacity, high population growth,
and external shocks. The UJAS proposes a number o f measures to mitigate the risks.

UJAS monitoring and evaluation. In the spirit o f harmonizing and aligning behind the
xi,
government development program, UJAS partners will rely o n the government’s own assessment
o f the results o f the PEAP injudging the development effectiveness o f the UJAS. The
government i s establishing an annual PEAP review mechanism, which will draw on existing
reporting and review arrangements for sector-specific support, for the PEAP as a whole, and for
the budget process. The PEAP policy and results matrix will be the reference document for these
annual PEAP reviews.
xii.
UJAS partners will assess the contributions o f their specific interventions to outcomes,
using the UJAS results matrix as the framework. The UJAS matrix is fully consistent with the
PEAP results matrix, but also contains milestones that are specific to the partners’ interventions.
Annual reviews linked to the PEAP reviews will provide early feedback o n both UJAS

xiii

implementation progress and impact. An in-depth midtenn review will provide detailed
information o n what i s working well and what needs to be strengthened or modified to better
achieve expected outcomes. A final self-evaluation o f the strategy and i t s implementation and
impact will be carried out at the end o f the UJAS period. In addition to assessing the outcome o f
specific interventions and their link to country outcomes, UJAS partners together with the
government will support an annual independent assessment o f progress o f partners in
organizational effectiveness, using the indicators agreed in the Paris Declaration o n
Harmonization.

UGANDA JOINT ASSISTANCE STRATEGY

1.

INTRODUCTION

The Uganda Joint Assistance Strategy (UJAS) presents a core strategy o f seven
1.
development partners for 2005-09, and provides the basis for the partners’ support o f the
implementation o f the government’s new Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP) covering
2005/06-2008/09.3 It has been prepared collaboratively by the UJAS partners: African
Development Bank (AfDB), Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, the United
Kingdom’s Department for International Development (DFID), and the W o r l d Bank Group.

2.
The UJAS specifies the ways in which the UJAS partners will support the
government’s efforts to achieve i t s PEAP outcome targets, drawing o n each partner’s
comparative advantage in providing expertise and assistance. I t therefore builds o n the
Partnership Principles agreed in 2003 between the government and i t s development partners.
The UJAS i s results oriented with a clear monitoring and evaluation framework derived from
the PEAP results matrix. The European Commission, Ireland, and Denmark support the
UJAS and intend to become UJAS partners during i t s lifetime.
In addition to the PEAP, the UJAS has been influenced by the analyses and policies
3.
associated with a number o f major international initiatives. These include the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) and the U.N.Millennium Project Report, the Report o f the
Commission for Africa, the Rome and Paris high level declarations o n aid effectiveness, and
the IMFAVorld Bank 2005 Global Monitoring Report. The New Partnership for Africa’s
Development, the United Nations Development Assistance Framework, the Strategic
Framework o f the International Development Association’s Assistance to Africa and i t s
operationalization in the Africa Action Plan have also influenced the strategic vision o n
which i t i s based.

4.
Chapter 2 reviews Uganda’s current economic and political situation and i t s
performance in relation to the MDGs. Chapter 3 summarizes the PEAP and the partners’
collective assessment of it. Chapter 4 sets out the key elements o f the joint assistance
strategy, outlining what the partners will support and how, and i d e n t i f j m g the major risks to
i t s successful implementation and the measures that will be taken to mitigate these risks.
Chapter 5 presents financing scenarios, describing the size and modalities o f partners’
contributions to PEAP implementation. Chapter 6 describes the results-based monitoring and
evaluation framework.
2.

UGANDA COUNTRY CONTEXT

Uganda i s widely characterized as a country that went from “basket case” to “success
5.
story.” Since 1986, Uganda has transformed from a nearly failed state as a result o f various
brutal dictatorships, to a country that has achieved consistently high economic growth rates,
significant reductions in poverty, and steady improvements in health and education status.

The UJAS includes the key interventions by all UJAS partners (see chapter 4). More detailed
information on each individual partner’s projects and programs will be provided separately.

6.
Uganda remains a country o f opportunities and challenges. Since 1986, economic
growth has been extraordinary and poverty has decreased substantially. Due to strong
macroeconomic management (low inflation, stable exchange rate, large foreign reserves),
savings, exports, and foreign direct investment are increasing. Within the region, Uganda has
been a leader in the fight against HIV/AIDS, with prevalence dropping significantly during
the past decade.
The challenge for Uganda i s now to deepen reforms already underway and prevent
7.
their reversal. This challenge will be heightened during the run-up to Uganda’s first
multiparty election since 1980, scheduled for February or March 2006. To accelerate growth,
the underpinnings o f a market economy need to be further strengthened, exports need to be
diversified, and new economic opportunities have to be sought. M o r e needs to be done to
attract private sector investors, who currently face l o w access to finance and high levels o f
corruption. Uganda’s very high rate o f population growth poses a long-term challenge for
growth and poverty reduction. Uganda i s s t i l l experiencing internal violent conflict, which
has major consequences for development.
Economic developments

8.
At the beginning o f the National Resistance Movement government in 1986,
Uganda’s economic, financial, and social infrastructure was in disarray following more than a
decade o f neglect and disrepair. The proportion o f Ugandans living in poverty stood at 56
percent and citizens’ access to essential services such as education, health, water and
sanitation and markets was very low.
9.
Since taking office, the National Resistance Movement government has pursued
policies promoting economic liberalization and private sector-based, export-led growth. I t
has successfully maintained macroeconomic stability, while steadily directing larger shares o f
public spending to investment, operations and maintenance, and public services targeting the
poor. Uganda’s average inflation rate has been below 5 percent for more than a decade. The
banking sector has been reformed. Privatization o f telecommunications has resulted in lower
cost services and an expansion in the number o f households and businesses served.

The government’s policies have yielded impressive results. Uganda’s gross domestic
10.
product grew at an average rate o f 6.9 percent during the 1990s. T h i s i s notable compared
with the average o f 2.2 percent that Sub-Saharan Africa as a whole achieved. Economic
growth during recent years appears to have slowed somewhat, but continues to be strong,
averaging 5.5 percent during 1999/2000-2004/2005. Continued high population growth
means that GDP growth per capita i s considerably lower, posing a challenge to the
government as it strives to reduce poverty. Gross domestic savings increased from only 4.7
percent o f gross domestic product (GDP) in 1999/2000 to 8.6 percent in 2003/2004, and
exports increased from 11.2 percent o f G D P to 13.7 percent o f GDP over the same period.
Foreign direct investment increased from US$133 m i l l i o n in 2000/2001 to US$202 m i l l i o n in
2003/2004 and i s estimated to have reached US$299 m i l l i o n in 2004/2005.
T o ensure that the momentum in economic growth and poverty reduction i s not lost,
11.
the government needs to build on past performance by addressing the following key
economic challenges:

Increasing mobilization o f domestic resources. Aid flows increased from 8 percent o f
G D P to over 12 percent o f GDP during 1998/99-2001/02 (comprising about 50
percent o f the government budget), financing large increases in public spending and
in the fiscal deficit. Aid inflows have since stabilized, and the deficit before grants
has fallen back from a peak o f 12.2 percent o f GDP (5.2 percent after grants) in
2001/02 to 9.9 percent o f GDP (1.1 percent after grants) in 2004/05. Domestic
revenue mobilization has improved modestly, but remains l o w at 12.7 percent o f
GDP. Mobilizing more revenues domestically i s important if the government i s to
generate sufficient resources to invest in infrastructure and deliver services to a
growing population, while avoiding the potentially adverse macroeconomic affects o f
a large deficit financed by aid and continued aid dependency.
Stimulating private investment. The business climate in Uganda has improved
significantly since the early 1990s, leading to growth o f private investment from 9
percent o f GDP in 1990/01 to 17 percent o f GDP in 2003/04. But much more needs
to be done if Uganda i s to attract private investment equal to 21 percent o f GDP that
the PEAP states i s required if Uganda i s to achieve i t s target GDP growth rate o f 7
percent.
Promoting exports. Nontraditional exports-notably fish, flowers and cut vegetables,
and tourism-have been growing rapidly, while the value o f coffee exports
(traditionally Uganda’s major export) has recovered modestly as international prices
have rebounded. But the overall export/GDP ratio o f 13.7 percent in 2003/04 i s s t i l l
low. Increasing exports will enable Uganda to generate the revenue and foreign
exchange i t needs to import capital goods and gradually reduce dependence on donor
aid.
Strengtheningexecution o f the budget. The government has operated a Medium
Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) for over 10 years. I t s transparent and
participatory budget process i s one o f the most-admired in Africa. The share o f the
government’s discretionary budget allocated to the Poverty Action Fund increased
from 17 percent in 1997/98 to 37 percent in 2004/05.4 However, expenditures on
public administration and defense have during the past few years o n several occasions
exceeded their initial allocations. Uganda has conducted various value for money
studies, which has helped to improve delivery o f health and education services.
However, value for money in all sectors s t i l l needs to be improved. Further
strengthening o f budget execution i s now needed to ensure that available resources are
used effectively to promote growth and reduce poverty.

Maintaining public debt within manageable levels. Some indicators o f external debt
sustainability have deteriorated since Uganda reached the Heavily Indebted Poor
Country (HIPC) completion point in 2000 (see box 2). Although the external debt
service ratio as a percentage o f exports and o f domestic revenues (about 10 percent
after HIPC relief) remains at levels well below critical benchmarks, the government i s
committed to maintaining public debt within levels that it can comfortably manage. I t
has therefore set a cap o f US$200 m i l l i o n o n net annual external concessional

The Poverty Action Fund was set up in 1997 as a virtual poverty fund within the MTEF to ensure that
resources resulting from the Heavily Indebted Poor Country Initiative (HIPC) were spent on core poverty
programs.

borrowing. The implications for this cap o f the July 2005 G8 debt relief initiative are
n o t yet clear. The debt initiative i f implemented in full will significantly reduce
Uganda’s debt burden.

Box 2: Uganda’s debt sustainability
In April 1998, Uganda became the first country to benefit from debt r e l i e f under the original
HIPC Initiative. Reaching the decision point under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative in February
2000, Uganda was also the first country to benefit from the Enhanced HIPC Initiative in

recognition o f the effectiveness o f the PEAP and the authorities’ continued commitment to
macroeconomic stability. Uganda graduated from the Enhanced HIPC Initiative with a net
present value o f external debt to 3-year average o f exports ratio o f 171 percent in fiscal 2001.

This ratio increased to 229 percent by the end June 2005, 32 percent higher than was projected in
a 2002 debt sustainability analysis. However, the deterioration in the debt to export ratio reflects
changes in exogenous factors, notably lower international interest rates and a weaker US. dollar
than had been projected. Higher than projected borrowing contributed marginally to an increase
in the ratio. In addition, Uganda’s exports actually outperformed projections, largely due to a
strong growth in non-coffee exports between 2002/2003 and 2004/2005. If the debt to export
ratio for this period i s recalculated using a l-year average o f exports ratio instead o f a 3-year
average, Uganda’s debt to export ratio amounts to only 179 percent.
According to current practice, debt thresholds for countries should be established in line with the
quality o f a country’s policy and institutions, suggesting that strong performing countries can
sustain higher debt ratios. Uganda i s considered a strong policy performer, for which the upper
threshold o f debt distress i s currently 200 percent o f debt to exports. W h i l e debt service seems
manageable, Uganda’s net present value o f debt to exports ratio i s only slightly below this level.
Given Uganda’s vulnerability to exogenous shocks, its probability o f debt distress will be
moderate before the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDFU). The MDRI w i l l substantially
reduce Uganda’s debt burden that could decrease Uganda’s net present value o f debt-to-exports to
46 percent in 2006/07.5 However, it remains a joint responsibility o f both the government and
development partners to prevent the debt burden from climbing again.

Poverty and inequality
The proportion o f the population living below the poverty l i n e in Uganda declined
12.
from 56 percent in 1992 t o 34 percent in 2000, o w i n g t o strong growth in real private
consumption except in the conflict-afflicted northern r e i o n (average growth 1.2 percent) and
in the arid eastern region (average growth 2.8 percent). Urban areas experienced particularly
strong growth and poverty reduction. The depth and severity o f poverty also declined, and
non-income welfare measures improved. F o r example, the ownership o f assets increased and
the quality o f housing improved. In addition, the proportion o f households even in the lowest
quintile owning bikes and radios and other consumer durables increased. Furthermore,
households successfully managed t o improve their welfare by earning more in their economic
activities through diversification o f income sources, increased education levels, and
improvements in labor productivity.

B

Assuming that debt relief under the MDRI i s provided on debt outstanding as o f end-2004 for IMF and
Africa Development Fund and as o f end-2003 for IDA. In addition, it i s assumed that the MDRI will be
implementedby the IMF and the Africa Development Fund in January 2006, and by I D A in July 2006.
For more details see the 2004 PEAP, and the Uganda Poverty Assessment (World Bank, 2005).

13.
However, data from the 2002103 Uganda National Household Survey, suggest that the
proportion o f Ugandans with income below the poverty line increased from 34 percent in
1999/00 to 38 percent in 2002/03 (table 1). According to this and other macroeconomic data,
the pace o f decline in poverty rates may be slowing, while inequality i s increasing. Most o f
the deterioration arose from a rise in income poverty in rural areas, where the proportion o f .
people living below the poverty line rose from 37 percent to 42 percent. Poverty i s often
transitory for those with incomes outside o f crop agriculture, but chronic for those who rely
primarily o n crop agriculture for their livelihood. The conflict-affected north remained the
poorest region (with 63 percent o f the population living in poverty). Poverty increased most
dramatically in the east (from 35 percent to 46 percent). Rapid population in urban areas
contributed t o a rise in urban poverty.

14.
The Second Uganda Participatory Poverty Assessment Program, carried out by the
government in 2003, identified several factors leading to high poverty levels. These include a
heavy burden o f disease; limited access to land and other assets; insecurity, particularly in
northern Uganda and in the east; lack o f control over productive resources by women; and
high fertility rates. I t reiterated that even with the dramatic decline in poverty over the last
decade, poverty in Uganda remains a serious problem.
Uganda’s high population growth rate o f 3.4 percent per year (the third highest in the
15.
world) poses a significant challenge in reducing poverty and inequality. High population
growth creates a requirement for both rapid and widely-shared growth. Policies to increase
the productivity o f agriculture are particularly important. Striking the right balance between
investing in areas that will support growth, and meeting the immediate demands o f the poor
for better services i s also important. Implementingprograms to promote girls’ education,
child survival, and access to family planning and reproductive health services are essential to
reduce fertility rates over the longer term.

Social developments and progress towards the MDGs
In step with good economic performance, key social indicators improved during the
16.
1990s. The introduction o f universal primary education has been followed by a big
improvement in the distribution o f expenditures for primary education, largely in favor o f the
poor and o f girls. Gross primary school enrolment increased from 71 percent o f school age
children in 1990 to 127 percent in 2003. Primary completion rates remain a challenge raising
concerns about the quality o f education. The decade long effort to bring health services
closer to the poor, as well as the recent abolition o f user fees has also helped to improve the
access o f the poor to public health services. As a result, under-five mortality declined from
180 per 1,000 live births in 1988/89 to 152 in 2000. These achievements enabled Uganda to
improve i t s ranking in the UNDP's Human Development Report from 154 out o f 173
countries in 1994 to 144 out o f 177 countries in 2005.

Uganda has made substantial progress towards achieving the MDGs, although more
needs to be done if all are to be achieved.' As can be seen from table 2, with continued good
policies, Uganda appears likely to achieve one o f the targets for MDG 1 (eradicate extreme
poverty), MDG 3 (promote gender equality and empower women), MDG 6 (combat
HIV/AIDS), MDG 7 (ensure environmental sustainability), and M D G 8 (develop a global
partnership for development). Uganda m a y also b e able to achieve MDG 2 (achieve
universal primary education) with greater effort to encourage children to complete primary
education. With adoption o f improved policies, strengthened institutions, and additional
funding, the country may be able to meet the target for hunger. However, progress towards

'

It i s important to note, however, that Uganda's long-term development objectives are set out in the PEAP
and that the PEAP contains targets that are as ambitious, and in certain areas (HIV/AIDS), even more ambitious
than the MDGS.

6

MDG 4 (reduce child mortality) and MDG 5 (improve maternal health) i s uncertain even with
improvements in policies, institutions, and finding.
18.
According to the U.N. Millennium Project Report (2005), with additional resources
and the right policy measures, Uganda may be able to reach all the PEAP and MDG targets.
The government, however, continues to be concerned that large fiscal deficits associated with
high levels o f aid will increase donor dependency and have adverse macroeconomic effects,
I t s priority i s to use existing resources more efficiently and to target additional external
resources (consistent with Uganda’s macroeconomic framework) o n investment in support o f
growth and physical infrastructure. The government i s also giving priority to measures that
will improve the effectiveness o f existing public expenditure, including through better
monitoring and evaluation.

Box 3: Addressing gender issues in Uganda
Uganda has shown exceptional leadership in addressing gender issues in the 2004 revision o f
i t s PEAP. The PEAP strongly articulates the relevance of gender for growth, poverty
reduction, and meeting the MDGs. The PEAP recognizes that economic incentives differ for
men and for women, and that this has important implications for GDP growth and output. To
this end, the PEAP identifies actions to enhance gender equality as one o f the critical measures
required to boost GDP growth to the 7 percent per year PEAP target.

The government incorporated key gender issues into the PRSCS including: (a) supporting the
mainstreamingof gender and equity objectives in planning and budgeting through
implementation o f the gender and equity budget guidelines issued in 2004; (b) deepening the
work program on gender and growth linkages for policymaking in Uganda, with increasing
focus on trade and strengthening women’s entrepreneurship, as part o f the wider growthsupporting framework o f the PEAP; (c) supporting further implementation o f the Land Sector
Strategic Plan to strengthen women’s land rights; (d) continuing to support the implementation
o f the gender-focused elements related to the justice, law and order sectors, including strategies
to support passage o f the domestic relations bill, and to launch the preparation o f the sexual
offences bill; and (e) continuing support to the revision and subsequent implementation o f the
country’s national gender policy.

Regional integration
19.
The signing in 1999 o f the East Africa Community (EAC) treaty by Kenya, Tanzania
and Uganda has revived the process o f regional integration. The objective o f the new E A C
treaty i s to achieve deeper regional integration among the three member states, first with the
establishment o f a customs union, then in due course a common market, a monetary union,
and ultimately a political federation. The E A C launched a customs union in January 2005,
and a three-band common external tariff that n o w applies to all imports into the customs
union.
20.
Regional integration i s expected to benefit the member states in several ways. It will
enhance the competitiveness o f regional producers by enabling them t o benefit from
economies o f scale. Improvements o f the northern corridor road, which links Uganda to the
port o f Mombasa, and a joint concession for Uganda and Kenya Railways i s expected to
substantially lower the costs o f transportation goods, currently estimated at 35 percent o f the
value o f Uganda’s exports. The integration o f the national power grids through the planned
East African Power Master Plan i s expected to generate benefits o f some US$500 million.

7

The E A C i s also expected to increase market transparency and reduce transaction costs for
f i r m s operating across the region. By reviving regional cooperation in the management o f
Lake Victoria and other shared natural resources, i t will also contribute to the sustainable
management o f important regional environmental resources.
21.
But deeper regional integration poses challenges. The Ugandan government i s having
to cope with modest losses o f customs revenue, because the country now imports a larger
proportion o f goods from within the E A C (which face l o w tariffs) than from outside.
Uganda’s producers now face greater competition from Kenyan and Tanzanian producers,
and must make adjustments to improve efficiency and overall competitiveness. Some face
higher costs for raw and intermediate inputs as a result o f the common external tariff.
Governance

Uganda’s rating in many areas o f governance today i s little better than during the mid22.
1990s. Concrete progress in improving governance i s critical for Uganda to meet i t s
development objectives. This will free available resources for public purposes instead o f for
private benefit, attract private sector investment, and unlock financing from development
partners.
23.
While Uganda’s score in Transparency International’s global corruption perception
index improved from 1.9 in 2001 to 2.6 in 2004, it stood at 2.6 in 1998. Uganda remains in
the category o f 60 countries with a score o f less than 3 out o f 10, regarded as countries
afflicted by “rampant corruption.” The government i s taking action to combat corruption. It
has established the institutions required to fight corruption and prepared a credible anticorruption strategy. But these measures have yet to yield tangible results. T h e government
has failed to successfully prosecute a single high-profile case o f corruption following various
commissions o f inquiry. This raises questions about the government’s commitment to
genuinely fight the problem. Strong political will and adequate financing o f anti-corruption
agencies are both required to combat corruption.
24.
Progress has been made in strenghtening the systems o f public financial management
to reduce opportunities for corruption. The 2004 Country Integrated Fiduciary Assessment
shows that between 2001 and 2004 performance improved in seven o f the 18 areas assessed,
although overall fiduciary risk remained high.8 Compared with other HIPC countries,
Uganda’s system o f public financial management i s relatively strong. The I M F / W o r l d Bank
2005 comparative assessment o f public financial management in 26 HIPC countries ranked
Uganda fifth overall with “some upgrading required.” I t s ranking was ahead o f 19 countries
where “substantial upgrading i s required.” Nonetheless, Uganda’s performance slip ed

violence remain serious concerns.

Political transition

Under the National Resistance Movement government, Uganda has been able to
27.
deliver better development outcomes and provide for greater representation o f poor people’s
interests than previous regimes. Uganda has also enjoyed a relatively free press for almost
two decades. In a referendum on July 28,2005 Ugandans, albeit in a l o w turnout, voted to
restore multiparty politics and the government has pledged that for the first time since 1980
the elections in 2006 will be contested o n a multiparty basis. Concerns, nonetheless, remain
about the nature, timing, and extent o f Uganda’s political transition process, including
whether amendments to the legal framework will be in place for credible, multiparty elections
in 2006. A smooth transition to a multiparty system will demonstrate the government’s
commitment to deepen democratization and will enhance i t s international reputation.

Conflict
There has been a major conflict in the north for the last 19 years, involving the Lord’s
28.
Resistance Army. Violence also continues in the Karamoja districts amongst the
Karamojong themselves and with their neighbors. Instability in some o f Uganda’s
neighboring countries persists, with potentially negative consequences for Uganda’s
development prospects. ,Despite the agreement signed in 2002 between the Government of
Uganda and the Uganda National Rescue Front I1bringing peace to the West N i l e region, the
economic and social development that will ensure the sustainability o f peace remains a
challenge.
The cost to human l i f e and development o f the conflict in the north has been acute.
29.
About 1.6 m i l l i o n people are now displaced, nearly 90 percent o f whom are living in camps,
These camps are overpopulated and lack basic social services. Their inhabitants are largely
unemployed and unable to contribute to the country’s economic development. Mortality
rates in the north are extremely high. Moreover a lack o f effective law enforcement and
protection o f civilian rights leave people vulnerable to abuse. High and persistent poverty in
the north i s contributing to the recent lack o f progress in reducing poverty nationally in
Uganda, and to rising inequality. Special efforts are needed to foster national and regional
reconciliation as well as peace building. Planning for reconstruction and development to
facilitate the return o f internally-displaced people to their home villages i s also critical.
The response from central government to protection o f the civilian population and
30.
humanitarian situation in the north has been inadequate. The international community
continues to provide the majority o f assistance to meet humanitarian needs. Insecurity
hampers efforts o f the U.N.agencies and o f nongovernmental organizations in providing
services. Local government i s also unable to play an effective role in addressing the
changing emergency needs, partly due to budgetary policies that restrict shifting centrallyallocated resources between budget lines. Districts have occasionally returned resources to
central government. Poor access to basic services will affect future development in the area
even if peace should be restored.

Civil society

3 1,
Uganda’s c i v i l society has grown rapidly during the past twenty years, with the
number o f registered NGOs rising from 160 in 1986 to 3,500 in 2000. During the repressive
regimes o f the 1970s and early 1980s, the operation o f c i v i l society organizations was
restrained, with their role restricted to provision o f social services. As a result, when the
National Resistance Movement came to power in 1986, c i v i l society was much weaker in
Uganda than in neighboring countries.
32.
Today, c i v i l society organizations are k e y partners in formulating, in implementing,
and in monitoring and evaluating the P E N . They are increasingly involved in ensuring that
a wide variety of voices are reflected in policy development, resulting in policies that better
reflect the priorities o f the poor. C i v i l society organizations in 2003 managed an extensive
consultative process for the revision o f the PEAP, providing detailed policy proposals in all
i t s aspects and ensuring that a wide variety o f perspectives were reflected in policy
development. They contribute to implementation o f the PEAP by delivering services and
promoting community development, either independently or as subcontractors to local
government. They are also actively monitoring implementation o f the PEAP, at both the

10

national and local levels. The government should continue to promote genuine government
and c i v i l society partnership in the context o f PEAP implementation and monitoring.
Proposed legislation to regulate the operations o f nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)
needs to be drafted carefully to unnecessarily avoid restricting their activities.

UGANDA’S POVERTY ERADICATION ACTION PLAN

3.

The government prepared i t s first PEAP in 1997, providing a model for the poverty
33,
reduction strategy approach. It revised the PEAP in 2000 and again in 2004. The latest
revision was based on broad consultation and required 18 months to complete. I t was
approved by the cabinet in November 2004 as a national framework for development.

The PEAP 2004
The PEAP 2004 restates Uganda’s ambitions o f eradicating mass poverty and o f
34.
becoming a middle income country in the next twenty years. The PEAP’s results and policy
matrix specifies targets for key outcomes (box 4 presents key strategic result indicators in
selected areas). This results and policy matrix provides the framework for UJAS partners to
align their interventions with the country’s development strategy (see chapter 4).
Box 4: Uganda: K e y PEAP planned strategic results
Reduced Poverty and Inequality
Proportion of the population living below poverty line reduced from 38 percent in 2003 to 28
percent by 2013114.
The Gini coefficient (a measure o f inequality) reduced from 0.43.

Improved Human Development
Infant mortality rate reduced from 88 to 68 per 1,000 live births (2003-08).
Maternal mortality rate reduced from 500 to 300 per 100,000 live births (2003-08).
Literacy increased to 85 percent o f both men and women (2010).
Increased GDP growth
Real GDP growth rises from the 2003 level o f 5.2 percent to an average o f 7 percent.

35.
The PEAP 2004 argues for a shift o f policy focus from recovery to sustainable growth
and structural transformation and presents specific government policies to accelerate poverty
reduction. I t identifies four core challenges:
0

0
0
0

Restoring security, dealing with the consequences o f conflict, and improving regional
equity
Restoring sustainable growth o f the incomes o f the poor
Human development
Using public resources transparently and efficiently to eradicate poverty.

These challenges are to be addressed through a series o f policies and measures
36.
grouped under five pillars:
Pillar I : Economic management. The government’s strategy aims to maintain
macroeconomic stability and to promote private sector driven, export-led growth.

11

Macroeconomic stability will be achieved by containing inflation, by mobilizing domestic
revenue, and by reducing the fiscal deficit (to cut the cost and increase the volume o f private
sector borrowing, reduce the cost o f servicing domestic debt, ease upward pressure o n the
exchange rate, improve budget security and reduce donor dependency, and improve both
external and domestic debt sustainability). The strategy also contains measures to promote
financial deepening and development o f micro finance institutions, to introduce competition
into the pension sector, and to promote private investment, trade liberalization, and export
diversification.
Pillar 2: Enhancing competitiveness, production and incomes. The strategy calls for
implementing the Plan for Modernization o f Agriculture and implementing the MediumTerm Competitiveness Strategy to attract private sector development. Key elements o f the
strategy articulated in the PEAP include (a) increasing investment in transport infrastructure
and in energy systems; (b) removing bureaucratic obstacles and exploring cost-effective ways
of delivering business development services to micro, small, and medium size enterprises; (c)
increasing the outreach o f financial services, particularly to farmers; (d) expanding
agricultural research and extension services, rural infrastructure, energy, market information,
and other agricultural services; and (e) improving incentives for sustainable management o f
natural resources.

Pillar 3: Security, conflict resolution, and disaster management, T h e overall objective o f the
strategy in this area i s to enhance the quality o f people’s lives by improving security.
Interventions aim at improving the defense and police services, more speedily and effectively
resolving conflicts, reducing cattle rustling, controlling small arms, strengthening disaster
preparedness and management (including programs to assist refugees and internallydisplaced people), and rehabilitating and reconstructing infrastructure and livelihood systems
in conflict-affected areas.
Pillar 4: Governance. The overall objective o f the pillar i s to strengthen political
governance, human rights, legal and justice systems, and public sector management and
accountability. These objectives will be achieved through measures ranging from promoting
democracy to reforming the public services.
Pillar 5: Human resource development. Human development i s both a necessary condition
for and a central objective o f development. K e y priorities in education are t o improve the
quality o f and completion rates in primary education, to enhance the quality of, access to, and
linkages to employment o f post-primary education (including skills development), and to
increase the relevance and quality o f higher education and adult literacy education. K e y
priorities for improving health services are to improve quality o f and access t o child and
maternal health care, to continue to implement reforms specified in the Health Sector
Strategic Plan, and to build o n past success in reducing HIV prevalence (particularly in the
north where rates are higher than the national average). 11 Other priorities include increasing
parents’ ability to plan the size o f their families, and initiating a public discussion o n the
implications o f high fertility rates for households and for national economic development.
Investing in water and sanitation systems, particularly in rural communities, i s also
emphasized.

For details, see the 2003 report o f the Infant and Maternal Mortality Task Force.

12

O n public expenditure, the PEAP emphasizes the need to improve the efficiency o f
37.
public spending and the use o f aid resources. I t sets out specific criteria for allocating public
expenditure, targeting growth (by focusing on infrastructure and agriculture), human
development, and security. It also specifies spending shares by sector in 2003/04 and
presents targets for spending shares for 2013/14. The PEAP acknowledges the benefits o f the
Poverty Action Fund in enhancing development partner confidence that resources are being
used to tackle poverty, but also notes the government’s desire to phase out the Poverty Action
Fund in the long term and to allocate funds for pro-poor programs through the normal budget
processes. The chapter highlights the government’s determination to introduce hard budget
ceilings that encompass both government and development partner funding. It restates the
government’s assessment that Uganda does not require significant increases in aid, i t s
concerns about debt, and i t s preference for budget support.
38.
The PEAP results and policy matrix sets out specific medium-term (2007/08) and
long-term (2013/14) targets for selected outcomes under each pillar, and the critical policy
actions judged necessary to meet them. The PEAP targets are at least as ambitious as the
MDGs and some are slightly more ambitious (see table 2).

13

Box 5: PEAP: Joint Staff Advisory Note 2005
The Joint Staff Advisory Note o f the PEAP 2004 prepared by the staffs o f the IMF and the World
Bank applauds the government for making substantial progress in incorporating the five core
principles o f poverty reduction strategies in i t s PEAP.

1, Country ownership. Preparation o f the PEAP was clearly a government-driven process, and
included broad participation by c i v i l society, local government, and the private sector.
2. Results orientation. The PEAP results matrix contains clearly defined targets, with annual
actions and outputs highlighted to create greater accountability. Efforts are ongoing to develop a
more comprehensive results matrix that can be monitored annually and that will help to bring into
one framework multiple monitoring and evaluation processes used by the government and
development partners.
3. Comprehensiveness. The definition o f poverty and measures to address poverty are much
broader and more comprehensive than in the past, and pay greater attention to cross cutting
issues.
4. Partnership focus. The PEAP reflects a broad consultative process and identifies the
important role o f all stakeholders-technocrats, politicians, c i v i l society and development
partners-in defining, implementing, and achieving the PEAP targets.
5. Long-term outlook. The PEAP builds o n a strong MTEF with well-costed activities linked to
the targets, and defines actions over a long term for achieving the MDGs.
The Joint Staff Advisory Note proposes strengthening the PEAP in five areas. These are:
Tackling insecurity andpoverty in the north and east. Insecurity in the north and the east i s
1,
limiting the effectiveness o f policies t o reduce the average national poverty rate. Bringing down
poverty in the north and the east to the national average would reduce Uganda’s overall poverty

rate by about 6 percentage points.
2.
Strengthening the macroeconomicj?amework. Better analysis o f the sources o f growthespecially analysis o f the reasons for relatively l o w productivity gains in recent years-and
further elaboration o f measures required to increase productivity are needed. Analysis o f h o w to
manage a potential scale-up o f programs to reach the MDGs in a way that does not jeopardize
macroeconomic stability i s also called for. This will require increased mobilization o f domestic
revenues and greater prioritization o f expenditures in line with the policy o f fiscal consolidation.
Promoting growth. Promoting growth will require substantial investments in infrastructure
3.
and reform o f policies. The PEAP emphasizes the tension between the resource requirement for
investments and the expectation o f Ugandans for improved access to quality services. This
tension i s exacerbated by the fact that over 50 percent o f the population i s n o w in the dependent
age groups with the young requiring primary and secondary education and the o l d seeking health
care, Hence, a longer-term vision o n the best way t o deliver key social services o n a sustainable
basis i s needed. A deeper analysis o f h o w t o address one o f the highest population growth rates
in the world would also be useful. Investment in services targeting smallholder agriculture and in
infrastructure (such as in transportation infrastructure and electricity) are needed t o bring about a
structural transformation o f the economy f r o m one that relies heavily o n the production o f
primary products to one that features industrial goods and services.
Enhancing human development. Along with increasing access to services, more can be
4.
done to improve the quality o f services in Uganda. Uganda s t i l l faces considerable difficulties in
achieving health-related MDGs.
5. Improving governance. Uganda’s progress o n governance i s mixed. M u c h more i s
required if the PEAP objectives are t o be achieved. Improving political governance i s a particular
challenge.

4.

A JOINT RESPONSE

Strategic Principles of the Uganda Joint Assistance Strategy
39.
The UJAS i s centered o n three principles, which are consistent with those articulated
in the Paris Declaration o n Aid Effectiveness. These are:
0

0

0

Supporting implementation o f the country-owned and led revised PEAP to achieve
the MDGs.
Collaborating more effectively, both among development partners and with the
government.
Focusing o n results and outcomes (including managing resources and improving
decision-making for results, and strengthening systems for monitoring and
evaluation).

The first part o f this chapter discusses h o w these core principles shape the UJAS. The
40.
second part o f this chapter describes h o w planned support o f UJAS partners will assist
Uganda in reaching selected outcomes specified in the PEAP results and policy matrix.
Supporting t h e implementation o f the revised PEAP

The UJAS seeks to fully align i t s partners’ activities with Uganda’s PEAP and i s
4 1,
responsive to the government’s Partnership Principles. The PEAP and the Partnership
Principles highlight the government’s preference for general budget support over any other
instruments for delivering aid. UJAS partners will respect this preference t o the extent
possible, given the constraints imposed by the policies o f their institutions. Collectively, they
will channel a greater proportion o f their assistance through coordinated budget support,
SWAps, and basket funding arrangements, assuming that the government maintains a
favorable policy framework. The number o f stand-alone projects outside core sector
programs will be reduced. Project aid will s t i l l be used to support activities such as capacity
building and institutional strengthening, community-driven initiatives, provision o f
humanitarian aid, and support for privately financed infrastructure investments. All project
aid, except that channeled through NGOs, U.N. agencies, and the private sector will be
integrated into the MTEF.
UJAS partners will continue to support policy analysis and engage in dialogue to help
42.
the government prioritize expenditures and reform policies to more rapidly achieve PEAP
targets and the MDGs. Such initiatives may be particularly relevant for conflict resolution
and for strengthening o f political governance. But in all instances the U J A S partners will
avoid parallel interventions and will work within appropriate Ugandan frameworks.

A flexible approach to assistance i s required. UJAS partners therefore will adapt their
43.
level and nature o f support in response to emerging national developments and needs.
Adjustments will be made in consultation with the government and with other partners. The
annual UJAS review process (based o n the annual PEAP implementation review process
discussed in chapter 6) will provide the opportunity for identifying and agreeing any changes.

15

Working better together

The U J A S partners understand “working better together” to mean increasingly using
44.
common arrangements to deliver aid and to achieve a more effective division o f labor among
themselves in supporting specific sectors or programs. To this end, partners will strive to
increasingly harmonize programming and policy dialogue, and to rationalize engagement in
sectors, choice o f aid instruments, and advisory capacity.
Progress in harm oniza tion

Considerable progress has been made recent years in harmonizing development
45.
assistance in Uganda. Progress includes:
Meeting every month as the local development partners group to discuss economic
and governance issues; and (excluding the World Bank and AfDB) meeting as the
Partner for Democracy and Governance to discuss the key political governance issues
in Uganda. 12
Increasingly coordinating provision o f budget support as the main instrument for
supporting implementation o f the PEAP, harmonized around PRSCs and the
government’s budget process.
Closely coordinating budget support operations, including the PRSCs, with the
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) o f the IMF.
Increasingly coordinating and sharing analytical and advisory work, appraisals and
reviews, fiduciary assessments, and accountability rules (for example, the multidonor
country integrated fiduciary assessment and analytical work o n gender and poverty).
Increasingly coordinating sector support by supporting a number o f mature SWAps,
engaging with government sector working groups, using basket funding mechanisms,
and bringing development partner-funded projects into alignment with sector
strategies. Partners are providing assistance through SWAps for health, education,
water, HIVIAIDS, and justice, law, and order that bring together a l l development
partners in these sectors. In addition, partners have adopted j o i n t financing
arrangements for strengthening o f local government, and for technical assistance for
public financial management. A number o f development partners are pooling their
funds in support o f regional programs, such as the M u l t i c o u n t y Demobilization and
Reintegration Program.

’’

Increasingly pursuingjoint policy dialogue. All partners participate in a joint
dialogue o n the public expenditure review, and in the j o i n t dialogue o n the north
through a Donor Technical Group. All bilateral partners are coordinating dialogue on
governance and human rights through the Partners for Democracy and Governance
Group.

The Partners for Democracy and Governance i s a group o f 16 development partners (Austria, Belgium,
Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, U.K.,U.S., EC, and
UNDP). The objective o f the group i s to support actions and programs that deepen democracy and facilitate the
transition towards greater political pluralism in the period leading up to and during the 2006 elections; and that
promote human rights and good governance.

16

0

0

Adopting silent partnerships in which one development partner formally represents
another in policy and sector dialogue, a practice that has significantly reduced
transactions costs o f dialogue for both development partners and the government.
Increasingly adopting joint development partner approaches to supporting nonstate
sectors. Joint working groups o n c i v i l society and on private sector development have
been established.

Future directions in harmonization

46.
The UJAS partners will build on progress made in harmonization. They w i l l seek to
increase their selectivity in the use o f aid modalities, and development partners who are able
to provide general and sector budget support will make this their priority.

All development partners are increasingly aware that there i s s t i l l substantial scope for
47.
harmonizing approaches to the provision o f budget support. Aligning budget support
timetables and the framework for decisions i s an important objective for the early stages o f
the implementation o f the UJAS.
48.
U J A S partners are also committed to achieve greater harmonization at the sector
level. Currently, progress i s most advanced in the health and water sectors, and a clear model
has emerged for best practice o n the basis o f this experience. This involves aligning
development partner support (including through projects) with sector priorities agreed with
the government, providing assistance predictably, complementing support provided by others
(including through the choice o f aid modality), and harmonizing development partner
assessments with a government-led review. UJAS partners’ aim i s to apply this model as
relevant in all sectors. A key area where further coordination i s needed i s support for
capacity building.
49.
U J A S partners will increasingly rationalize the program and policy areas in which
they are engaged. I t i s hoped that the government will take the lead in this process o f
increasing selectivity, although i t will also require development partners to critically self
assess their comparative advantages. An assessment o f comparative advantages will take
place in the period leading up to the first UJAS annual review in 2006. Efforts will be made
to involve non-UJAS partners in this process. At the time o f the review it i s intended that
UJAS partners will agree o n the areas in which each will remain engaged and those in which
they will delegate responsibility to others.

The results-orientation o f the PEAP covers four distinct stages (figure 3). In the first
5 1.
stage, the government prioritizes i t s development goals. In the second stage, the PEAP i s
implemented through various interventions, with support from development partners and c i v i l
society organizations. In the third stage, stakeholders monitor and evaluate progress towards
PEAP outcomes through the annual PEAP implementation review. In the fourth stage, the
government revises the PEAP, and partners and c i v i l society organizations realign their
support in accordance with emerging circumstances and with the lessons learned from
implementation experience.

The UJAS results matrix in annex 1 replicates the PEAP outcomes to which partners’
52.
interventions will contribute. Specifically it shows: (a) PEAP outcomes, (b) issues and
obstacles to achieving PEAP outcomes, (c) milestones, (d) strategies and actions and (e)
specific interventions o f UJAS partners designed to contribute to the achievement o f specific
PEAP outcomes.

Uganda Joint Assistance Strategy Program Focus

Although UJAS partners are supporting the implementation o f the PEAP in general,
53,
they will focus o n five areas judged to be especially important for achieving the PEAP’s
overarching strategic results. These are:
0

0

0

Support to strengthen the budget process and for cross-cutting reforms. Budget
support and grants will assist in reforming public sector management intended to
increase the accountability o f government.
Promoting private sector development and economic growth. Growth i s a necessary
condition for poverty reduction. Growth cannot be achieved without unlocking the
potential o f the private sector to invest and innovate or without sustained investment
in agriculture and infrastructure. Small-and medium size enterprises in particular
have the potential to serve as the engines o f growth in Uganda, given the incentives to
do so.
Strengthening governance. Despite some progress, much more needs to be done to
improve governance. Comprehensive public service reform, stronger public financial

21

management, strengthening o f institutions o f oversight, and creation o f local
government capacity are important objectives.
0

0

Promoting improved education and health outcomes. The quality, and not just the
quantity, o f services i s critical to improve outcomes in learning achievement, life
expectancy, and child and maternal mortality. N o w that nearly all Ugandan children
are able to attend primary school and households are able to access basic health
services, the priority i s to enhance the quality o f both education and health services to
improve outcomes.
Promoting the resolution o f the conflict in the north and fostering the social and
economic development o f the region. Promoting development o f northern Uganda
requires action ranging from conflict resolution, to investment in infrastructure, to
delivery o f social services, and to resettlement o f displaced people as the security
situation allows.

The UJAS i s organized to support the five pillars o f the PEAP. Budget support will
54.
contribute t o achievement o f the objectives o f all five pillars. Individual projects and
programs w i l l complement budget support. Support under a specific pillar will contribute to
the achievement o f objectives o f other pillars. For example, UJAS support for resolving
conflict and improving governance (pillars 3 and 4) will contribute to enhancing incomes
(pillar 2), and human development (pillar 5).
Pillar 1: Economic management

55.
In support o f sound macroeconomic management, UJAS partners will provide
financial support and offer regular analytic and policy advice aimed at improving budget and
public financial management, developing financial systems (including micro and rural
financial services), ensuring debt sustainability, and enhancing capacity for collecting and
analyzing statistics. UJAS partners will continue to support a range o f core diagnostic work
to improve fiscal sustainability, including public expenditure reviews, fiduciary assessments,
and expenditure tracking studies. They will support activities to modernize systems o f the
Uganda Revenue Authority and increase mobilization o f domestic revenue. UJAS partners
will also support privatization, reform o f utilities, and enhancement o f public service
performance. They will support measures to enhance financial management o f local
government programs and conduct social impact assessment o n the reform o f local taxes. T o
address concerns about Uganda’s growing debt burden, U J A S partners will provide as much
support as possible in the form o f grants and support systematic, regular debt sustainability
analyses. The UJAS partners in a country economic memorandum will study a range o f
issues associated with growth, including i t s distributional aspects.
Pillar 2: Enhancing production, competitiveness, and incomes

The PEAP recognizes the importance o f attracting private investment and increasing
56.
the productivity and profitability o f both farm and nonfarm enterprises to achieve and sustain
high economic growth rates. The PEAP adopts the framework provided by the MediumTerm Competitiveness Strategy and the Plan for Modernization o f Agriculture to enhance
production, competitiveness, and incomes.

22

Increased private sector competitiveness

U J A S partners will continue to promote private sector development in several ways.
57.
They w i l l help to strengthen public sector management, accountability, and delivery o f
services. Partners will also help to reduce the cost o f doing business in Uganda through
programs t o reform the financial sector, streamline the regulatory framework, and improve the
functioning o f business development services. To strengthen commercial justice, activities will
focus o n improving the capacity o f the commercial courts, establishing systems for continuous
updating o f the companies registry and the land registry, strengthening the commercial regulatory
environment, and building capacity o f professional legal services. The expected outcome will be
enhanced capability o f the private sector to enforce contracts in a satisfactory and timely manner.
The partners will also support Uganda’s efforts to bolster i t s knowledge economy through
enhanced science and technology research and teaching, and through skills development. A
trade facilitation project will promote increased cross-border transactions through provision o f
risk insurance. Investment operations aimed at strengtheningthe functioning o f financial
systems and promoting microfinance will help to increase private sector access to finance.
Analytical work will include a diagnostic trade integration study to further encourage
58.
efforts to create regionally integrated markets and to minimize barriers t o trade. This study
will analyze Uganda’s export potential and identify trade policy options and actions to increase
capacity for trade. The country economic memorandum o n growth will identify the constraints
to growth and explore potential new sources o f growth. Furthermore, the partners will
continue t o support annual investment climate assessments, investors’ roundtables, and
revisions t o the Medium-Term Competitive Strategy.
Increasing agricultural productivity and rural development

To promote the productivity and diversification o f agriculture and the expansion o f
59.
rural nonfarm enterprises, UJAS partners will support the implementation o f the Plan for
Modernization o f Agriculture. In particular, UJAS partners will support programs t o improve
livestock productivity, enhance agriculture marketing systems, and increase registration o f land
ownership, especially for women. The partners will also assist the government to overcome a
variety o f obstacles to the export o f high-value agricultural and fisheries products, including
cut flowers, beef, organically-grown vegetables, and N i l e perch. Support for the national
agricultural research system and the national agricultural advisory services, including the
latter’s roll-out, will help farmers to access high-quality and timely advice o n ways to reduce
the risks inherent in agriculture and to produce and market higher-value products. Emphasis
will be placed on promoting environmentally-sound technologies that enhance soil quality and
improve the management o f water resources.

60.
T o promote rural development more broadly, partners are supporting sector reforms
and investments in rural roads and energy, and measures to promote development o f rural and
microfinance institutions. Partners will also support implementation o f a strategy for micro,
small, and medium-size rural enterprises, creation o f ecotourism infrastructure in protected
areas, and development o f mining enterprises.
Improving infrastructure for growth

The UJAS partners will help create infrastructure that reduces the cost o f doing
6 1.
business, links isolated areas o f the country to the broader economy, and promotes regional

23

integration. Investments in power generation facilities will increase the reliability and lower
the cost o f electricity, which i s a major cost to business according t o the 2004 investment
climate assessment. A rural energy program, with the support o f the Global Environmental
Facility, will harness local entrepreneurial capacity in expanding access o f rural communities
to modem energy sources, including renewable energy. Projects to build ministerial capacity,
promote private sector involvement, and strengthen energy sector institutions will seek to
create an efficient, commercially-viable energy sector. Partners will promote improved rural
access and regional connectivity through support for the implementation o f the ten-year
national road sector development program. This will include major upgrading and
maintenance of road networks and reforms o f road sector institutions. Project support will help
Kampala meet the demands of firms and a rapidly growing population (nearly 4 percent a year)
for basic infiastructural services. Project support will also boost urban development by linking
cities and towns to the national road network and power grid.

An East African Transport and Trade Facilitation Project will enhance regional trade
62.
by supporting the rehabilitation o f infrastructure along the main transport corridors and
improving access to finance for cross-border trade between participating countries. The
project will also support the concessioning to the private sector o f Uganda Railways jointly
with Kenyan Railways to help connect Ugandan markets with the port o f Mombasa in Kenya.
Strengthened environment and resource management

63,
The UJAS partners recognize the importance o f a sustainable, integrated approach to
natural resource management for broad-based economic growth. T h i s requires adequately
financed regulatory agencies and sound policy and regulatory frameworks. The partners will
support improved management and sustainable use o f protected areas, and improved
productivity and governance o f the Lake Victoria ecosystem and o f the N i l e river. A natural
resource management SWAP i s planned for the latter h a l f o f the U J A S period that will bring
together the efforts o f all partners in this area.
Pillar 3: Security, conflict resolution and disaster management

UJAS partners will support initiatives in conflict-affected areas that address the
64.
various requirements o f conflict and post-conflict situations. These include provision o f
humanitarian assistance, activities to improve security, assistance to promote economic and
social recovery, and measures to bring about a solution to conflict and consolidate peace once
achieved.
Conflict resolution, demobilization, reintegration, and security

A solution to the conflict in northern Uganda i s possible during the UJAS period.
65.
Bilateral UJAS partners will continue to support efforts to resolve the conflict and will work
closely with a number o f local groups and individuals involved in attempts to foster dialogue.
UJAS partners will also help with reconciliation as a national task. They will support the
reintegration o f internally displaced people, returning refugees, and former rebels. T h i s will
include an intervention under the Multicountry Demobilization and Reintegration Program

24

that will assist the Uganda Amnesty Commission with reintegration and resettlement. l4
Certain programs, including the Northern Uganda Social Action Fund, will be realigned to
meet changing needs. A joint needs assessment will be carried out to determine other areas
of support. Partners will work to ensure that, where the government i s a lead partner, their
assistance i s firmly integrated within the MTEF and sector strategies. Partners will continue
dialogue with government o n ways to provide adequate security for inhabitants o f conflict
areas and to improve human rights, justice, law and order.
Disaster management, service delivey, and humanitarian interventions in confict-affected
areas

Partners will work with the government to strengthen systems for managing disasters,
66.
delivering services, and providing humanitarian assistance. Partners will also support
analytical work that will help improve the effectiveness o f programs in the north. This will
include a review o f public expenditure in the north, collection o f data o n internally displaced
people, and a land use planning study. UJAS partners will also work t o improve the capacity
of local districts to provide services in areas that have been or s t i l l are affected by insecurity.

67.
Bilateral UJAS partners will continue to provide humanitarian aid through the U.N.,
NGOs, and, where appropriate, the government. The UJAS partners recognize that other
organizations hold the comparative advantage in effectively meeting humanitarian needs in
the north. T h i s i s particularly the case for the U.N. agencies; assistance t o conflict-affected
areas i s one o f the four areas o f cooperation in the new United Nations Development
Assistance Framework. The partners will continue t o work together t o ensure that
humanitarian support i s guided by the priorities and programs identified by the U.N.
Consolidated Humanitarian Appeal.
Pillar 4: Good governance

The strategy to promote good governance will focus o n dialogue with the government
68.
and assistance to build capacity o f key institutions. Continued support to c i v i l society by
bilateral development partners will be critical to achieve the objectives under this pillar.
Systems of representation, human rights, and justice

69.

Bilateral development partners will provide assistance t o the government and c i v i l
society and engage in dialogue and negotiation with the government o n issues o f political
governance, democratization, and strengthened protection for human rights. Most UJAS
partners will support the Justice, Law, and Order SWAP, which will strengthen legal and
judicial systems. They will also work with institutions such as parliament and the Ugandan
Human Rights Commission.
Strengthened public Jinancial management and reduced corruption

70.
UJAS partners regard strengthened public financial management and reduced
corruption as critical for development. Analytical work will include the fiduciary and budget

The Multicountry Demobilization and Reintegration Program i s a regional strategy for demobilization
and reintegration in the countries o f the Great Lakes. It was developed by a large group o f U.N.partners,
donors, countries, and other stakeholders. The program provides a framework for national and international
efforts to assist excombatants to return to peaceful sustainable livelihoods in countries, including Uganda.

25

efficiency/tracking analyses, previously noted in the discussion o f pillar 1. Financial support
will contribute to the strengthening o f public financial management, procurement, and
accounting; some partners plan to cofinance the Public Financial Management Reform
Program. Support to the Department of Ethics and Integrity and to the Inspector General o f
Government will strengthen Uganda’s anticorruption institutions and help to implement the
government’s National Strategy to Fight Corruption.
Improved public service delivery

Support for the government’s comprehensive Public Service Reform Program will
71.
help the government to strengthen public service management and accountability. Assistance
aimed at enhancing the financial, institutional, and human capacity o f local governments and
measures and support to strengthen c i v i l society organizations will help the government
achieve i t s objectives o f effectively devolving responsibility for local service delivery.
Analytical work o n local tax issues and a review o f decentralization and effective local
service delivery will guide reforms.
Pillar 5: Human development

The PEAP sets ambitious targets for improving health and educational outcomes. The
72.
UJAS partners are committed to supporting Uganda’s efforts to combat the H I V / A I D S
epidemic and develop quality, accessible, and sustainable health, education, and water and
sanitation services. They will help implement policy frameworks for population and related
reproductive health issues. They will support measures to promote equity o f women, the
poor, and the vulnerable, with priority actions mainstreamed into sector plans and budgets.
Improving access to high-quality education

The government has articulated i t s priorities for education in i t s Education Sector
73.
Strategic Plan 2004-201 5. These are t o significantly increase equitable access t o education at
all levels, to improve the quality o f education, to strengthen linkages to employment o f postprimary education, to increase the relevance o f higher education and adult literacy education.
UJAS partners will support the implementation o f the government’s strategy through
74.
a wide range o f interventions. General budget support will provide most o f the financial
resources. Additional project support will include a major initiative to foster science and
technology aimed at improving the capacity at the tertiary level for science research and
training while strengthening linkages to science education at the secondary level. Analytical
work will be undertaken to review the quality o f education, in particular vocational training,
to identify measures for improving school management and raising and monitoring teaching
standards. Other analytical work will focus o n promoting private sector participation in
provision o f post-primary education. Partners will participate in annual joint education sector
reviews that examine progress in attaining targets for the sector.
Promoting better health

75.
The government’s strategy for health services, laid out in the Health Sector Strategic
Plan, i s to provide all Ugandan households with access to a minimum package o f health
services that includes interventions targeting the most cost-effective measures for improving
the health status o f the population. Such interventions include childhood immunization;
26

prevention and treatment o f malaria, sexually transmitted infections, and environmentallytransmitted diseases; and assistance for reproductive health services. Other elements o f the
strategy focus o n prevention and o n improving the quality o f and access t o child and maternal
health care through multisectoral interventions. The strategy calls for strengthening the
capacity o f the ministry o f health for human resources planning and development, expanding
and improving the quality o f training o f health care workers, and building capacity o f the
district health systems for planning, financing, and managing the system.

76.

General budget support will be the m a i n modality through w h i c h U J A S partners
finance the implementation o f the government’s strategy. Additional specific financial
support will be targeted t o malaria control and reproductive health services. To ensure that
financing i s effective, U J A S partners will participate with the government in annual health
sector reviews that examine performance in attaining targets for health outcomes. Emphasis
will be placed o n closely monitoring improvements in child health and access to maternal
health services to ensure that progress towards the M D G s i s made in these areas.

Reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS and mitigating its impact

77.
The U J A S partners will support the implementation o f the National Strategic
Framework for H N / A I D S (see b o x 6). Ensuring that the high volume o f external resources
channeled t o support Uganda’s fight against H I V / A I D S i s coordinated and provided in
accordance with the National Strategic Framework i s critical. Some U J A S partners will
provide j o i n t support t o Uganda Aids Commission Partnership Fund. Recognizing the role o f
U.N.system, especially o f U N A I D S , the partners will work to ensure that their assistance i s
complementary t o that provided by the U.N.agencies.
Box 6: Tackling HIV/AIDS in Uganda
Uganda has been one o f the most successful countries in Africa in reducing the spread o f
HIV/AIDS. Uganda’s success in controlling HIV/AIDS has been due to strong political
leadership, and implementation o f a successful multi-sector strategy focused on prevention. Still,
i t i s estimated that over a million people are currently infected, with potentially devastating
consequences for the families and communities. Providing care and treatment for the 1 million
Ugandans estimated to be HIV positive poses a major challenge to the government, to
communities, and to households. Caring for the 2 million orphans who require special services if
they are to reach their full potential as adults i s another daunting need.

The government’s National Strategic Framework for HIV/AIDS focuses on prevention through
the ABC model (abstinence, being faithful, and condom use), treatment through sustainable and
equitable provision o f antiretrovirals, and assistance to improve the quality o f life for people living
with HIV/AIDS. The strategy also involves strengthening capacity o f the Uganda AIDS
Commission, enacted by parliament in 1992, to enable the institution to effectively carry out i t s
coordinating role.
Key accomplishments in recent years include Uganda’s adoption o f the internationally endorsed
“3 ones” approach to combat HIVIAIDS (one national AIDS coordinating authority; one agreed
AIDS action framework; and one monitoring and evaluation framework), and translating this to
the subnational level under the guidance o f the Uganda AIDS Commission. The drafting o f sector
AIDS policies for health, education, labor, social development, and public service have also been
important milestones over the last few years and represent progress in mainstreaming HIV/AIDS
across government policy.

27

Expanding water and sanitation services

Expanding access to water and sanitation services has long been a priority for
78.
Uganda. K e y elements o f the government’s Water Sector Strategic Investment Plan are to
harness private sector financing and management expertise for provision o f water in cities
and towns where feasible, and to set tariffs at a level to ensure that water services are
commercially viable. The government will provide targeted subsidies to promote the
expansion o f water services to periurban areas and to ensure that services are affordable to
the poor. I t will also continue to subsidize capital investment in water services in rural areas,
while building capacity for community management and maintenance o f water systems.

79.
The U J A S partners through a SWAP and general budget support will assist with the
completion and consolidation o f water sector reforms aimed at ensuring that water and
sanitation services are sustainable, cost effectiveness, and affordable to the poor. Annual
joint partner-government sector reviews will examine the effectiveness o f expenditures in
meeting targets, while specific studies will investigate constraints in detail and will propose
solutions for overcoming them.
Reducing vulnerability and strengthening communities

80.
The government recognizes that cohesive communities are essential to promote social
and economic security for all, and especially for vulnerable groups. Strategic actions include
recruiting and training community development workers, mobilizing communities to provide
training in functional adult literacy, and organizing communities to care for orphans, the
elderly, and persons with disabilities. Emphasis will be placed on measures that promote
gender equity in family, work, and community life.
8 1.
U J A S partners will support these initiatives through assistance to improve local
service delivery and public service management. A study on the status o f social protection in
Uganda will provide recommendations o n measures to improve social safety nets. UJAS
partners will support the implementation o f the government’s revised gender policy and plan
o f action. The UJAS partners will support c i v i l society organizations in their important role
in reducing vulnerability and strengthening communities. The partners enjoy a vibrant
relationship with civil society organizations.

FINANCING SCENARIOS

The UJAS partners will finance the implementation o f the PEAP through four main
83.
channels: direct budget and project support to the government, support to the programs o f
civil society organizations, assistance to the private sector, and support channeled through
U.N.agencies. Although some UJAS partners expect to deliver an increasing proportion o f
their support through direct budget support, all w i l l continue to provide some assistance as
project support. All direct budget support and a large share o f project support i s integrated
within the government’s MTEF, but some project support such as that channelled through
NGOs, the private sector, will remain external t o the government’s budget. The public
expenditure review working group during the past few years has established a forum with
government to review and monitor the budget process and outcomes and ensure that
information on support o f development partners i s provided in a timely manner.

31

A i d channeled through the government’s budget

Uganda’s development partners provided about US$800 m i l l i o n through the budget
84.
for 2004/05, divided equally between budget support (including US$80 m i l l i o n as debt
relief), and grants.” This i s broadly consistent with the annual requirement for external
financing to fund the budget set out in the PEAP (allowing for government’s practice o f
partially discounting development partner commitments). O f this, current U J A S partners
provide an average o f US$300 m i l l i o n per year as direct budget support and US$250 m i l l i o n
per year as project support.
Base case scenario

85.
Table 5 presents the base case, with overall financing projections broadly stable over
the UJAS period. Support will be focused o n the PEAP’s priority areas as set out in chapter
4. As stated earlier, overall support o f the UJAS partners i s expected to shift progressively
from project support to budget support and from concessional loans to grants in conformity
with the imperatives o f their respective agencies. This base case scenario assumes that the
government continues to successfully implement the PEAP.
86.
Two alternative l o w and high case financing scenarios are also envisaged. Any
decision to move away from the base case scenario will be made o n the basis o f the results o f
the annual PEAP review and o f an assessment o f financing needs. Some key indicators for
the assessment are set out in table 5. Actual financing levels will be linked t o performance,
with rolling three-year projections o f support provided to the government in line with the
budget calendar (see below). Different UJAS partners may give greater weight t o
performance in some areas than in others, and will decide individually o n the level and
composition o f i t s assistance program. However, the intention i s to adopt a common
assessment framework and a common review mechanism in line with the government’s
emerging proposals for the new PEAP review mechanism.

~~

The government’s budget does not include direct donor support channeled through NGOs and the private
sector, or humanitarianrelief provided through the U.N.system. This i s estimated to total at least US$200-300
million per year.

33

Low case scenario

87.
A l o w case scenario would be triggered if performance in economic management
deteriorates significantly, the commitment to a pro-poor policy agenda declines, conflict within
the region resurges, or commitment to improve governance and enhance public financial
management falters. For some UJAS partners issues concerning political transition and human
rights are also important. They may shift to a l o w case scenario if political transition falls short
o f being free and fair or if the human rights situation further deteriorates. A move to a l o w
case will be gradual and follow intensive discussions with the government to ensure that core
priorities o f the PEAP are not sacrificed.
88.
Under the l o w case scenario, support o f UJAS partners would likely decline to about
US$300 m i l l i o n per year, with total annual financing from all development partners likely to
fall to US$600 million. Support could fall further if UJAS partners lose confidence in the
government’s commitment to economic and social development. In the l o w case, U J A S
partners will support basic service delivery for the poor, programs to reduce the spread o f
HIV/AIDS, measures to strengthen accountability institutions and c i v i l society organizations,
and humanitarian relief. Financing for general budget support would drop, and fewer resources
would be available for major infrastructure projects. However, UJAS partners would to
varying degrees continue to undertake analytical work and provide technical assistance and
policy advice to assist the government in improving performance.
High case scenario

To accelerate progress in attaining PEAP objectives and MDGs, or to assist with
89.
rehabilitating the economy o f the north, UJAS partners will move to a high case scenario if
they and the government agree that the country’s general conditions allow for an increase in
resource flows, and that additional resources will be used effectively t o promote accelerated
growth and poverty reduction. Under this scenario, UJAS partners would be ready to support
additional public investment, especially in roads, regional infrastructure, energy, and
community and rural development projects.
Financing details

Approximate annual base case levels o f support o f UJAS partners t o Uganda as a whole
90.
are summarized in table 6. For bilateral development partners, these remain subject to annual
confirmation (and sometimes parliamentary approval), but will be confirmed annually with a
rolling indicative 3 -year horizon, in accordance with the requirements o f Uganda’s budget
timetable. The W o r l d Bank and the AfDB will provide indicative financing over a rolling
three-year cycle, although the level o f grant financing available from the International
Development Association (IDA) will be confirmed annually.

9 1,
The financing scenarios discussed here make n o assumptions about the impact o f recent
decisions by a number o f U J A S partners to increase their aid flows globally to assist countries
to reach the MDGs. I t i s not possible at this stage to project what these decisions will mean for
development assistance to Uganda. The government remains concerned about the impact o f
high levels o f aid o n macroeconomic stability and aid dependency. Attention will also have to
be paid to overcoming constraints t o absorptive capacity, such as human resource and
institutional capacity constraints. These issues are being addressed in the country economic
memorandum o n growth. Discussions about additional aid flows should not distract

34

RESULTS BASED MONITORING AND EVALUATION FRAMEWORK

UJAS approach to monitoring and evaluation
To meet the PEAP targets, making the best possible use o f all available resources i s
92.
critical, which requires a strong focus o n results. Annual monitoring and evaluation will
assess both the developmental effectiveness o f the PEAP as measured through progress
towards the PEAP targets, and the operational effectiveness o f UJAS partners, with a focus
o n harmonization and alignment. At completion, an independent team o f evaluators will
assess the effectiveness o f the overall UJAS. Monitoring and evaluation i s essential in
promoting accountability. By supporting these processes in Uganda, the UJAS partners seek
to meet their responsibilities for accountability to their domestic constituencies and governing
bodies, and to help Uganda’s citizens and c i v i l society hold their own government to account.
93.
In the spirit o f harmonizing and aligning behind the government development
program, UJAS partners will rely o n the government’s o w n assessment o f the results o f the
PEAP injudging the development effectiveness o f the UJAS. UJAS partners will therefore
support the establishment o f a robust national monitoring and evaluation system that allows
for regular reporting o f PEAP implementation and results. Partners will also encourage the
government to engage c i v i l society in i t s monitoring and evaluation efforts. They will also
promote the creation o f a culture o f evidence-based management across the government. The
UJAS partners will seek to avoid creating any structures that are not based o n established
government systems for assessing progress towards Uganda’s PEAP results. A priority will
be to discuss with the government how the PEAP matrix can be strengthened to reflect the
agenda on governance and human rights. In the interim, some UJAS partners will use the

35

matrix developed by the Partners on Democracy Governance as an additional basis for their
assessment o f governance and human rights in Uganda.

Uganda’s monitoring and evaluation capabilities

94.

Uganda has made considerable efforts to develop i t s monitoring and evaluation
systems and practices, including establishing a strong statistical system. A poverty
monitoring and evaluation strategy was developed for the 2000 PEAP. The Ministry o f
Finance, Planning and Economic Development since 1999 has been producing biennial
poverty status reports and poverty reduction strategy progress reports to track progress with
PEAP implementation. K e y line ministries also prepare annual reports o f progress in
implementing sector strategies.
Strengthening o f monitoring and evaluation systems has led to improved
95.
accountability and greater rationality in public expenditure management. The system also
provides a strong foundation for results-based management. This, however, has been
achieved through the proliferation o f many discrete initiatives, often backed by individual
development partners, which has led to significant duplication o f efforts, waste o f resources,
and poor coordination between data users and data producers. What Uganda now needs i s
not more, but better, monitoring and evaluation, according to a study o f the World Bank’s
Operations Evaluation Department. T o better coordinate monitoring and evaluation
initiatives, the government i s now developing a National Integrated Monitoring and
Evaluation Strategy (NIMES). T h i s i s a framework that brings together the users and
producers o f information to ensure that the data collected i s relevant, timely, o f high quality,
and accessible for policymaking. A secretariat will manage the process o f coordination.
Importantly, the government has also started developing a more systematic approach to
evaluations, value-for-money studies, and expenditure tracking studies. I t has also taken
steps to increase the use o f beneficiary assessments to promote public accountability.
Successful implementation o f the strategy should provide the basis for improving results
through better-informed decision-making, and UJAS partners are committed to supporting it.

Assessing PEAPKJJAS results
Progress towards the PEAP results will be assessed through the information generated
96.
as part o f the government’s overall monitoring and evaluation effort. The government i s
establishing an annual PEAP review mechanism, which will draw o n existing reporting and
review arrangements for sector-specific support, for the PEAP as a whole, and for the budget
process, rationalizing these where necessary (see b o x 7). T h e PEAP policy and results matrix
will be the reference document for these annual PEAP reviews and will be updated every
year.

97.
UJAS partners recognize that their support i s only one factor influencing PEAP
outcomes. They will also assess the contributions o f their specific interventions to outcomes,
using the UJAS results matrix (annex 1) as the framework. T h i s framework i s wholly
consistent with the PEAP matrix. Annual reviews linked to the PEAP reviews w i l l provide
early feedback o n both implementation progress and impact. An in-depth midterm review
will provide detailed information o n what i s working w e l l and what needs to be strengthened
or modified to better achieve expected outcomes. A final self-evaluation o f the strategy and
i t s implementation and impact will be carried out at the end o f the U J A S period.

Box 7: PEAP review and reporting arrangements
The government has developed a PEAP policy and results matrix that will serve as the basis for
the review and reporting arrangements for the PEAP 2004. This matrix presents for the first time
a comprehensive framework to guide implementation, reporting, and review o f the PEAP. I t i s
organized as a hierarchy o f goals, linking concrete steps in reform processes (annual policy
actions) to developmental outcomes. It contains quantitative indicators that will be used to
measure progress towards outcomes and results. T h e PEAP policy and results matrix also
includes the prior actions agreed between the government and development partners as the basis
for budget support.
The PEAP plan for monitoring and evaluation makes use o f three main types and sources o f data:
Censuses and sample surveys carried out by the Uganda Bureau o f Statistics.
Administrative data regarding the allocation and utilization o f financial resources and
standards o f service delivery.
Self-reported qualitative evidence on implementation o f PEAP policy actions.
The evidence from these sources will be stored and made accessible through a centralized PEAP
information management system.
PEAP reviews will take place each year during i t s four-year timeframe. The overall direction o f
the PEAP, including the organization o f the pillars and the cross-cutting k e y results areas will
remain in place for the entire PEAP timeframe. Individual results and policy actions will be
subject to annual refinement and amendment. The product of the annual review cycle i s a revised
PEAP policy and results matrix. The product o f the four-year review cycle i s a fully revised
PEAP.

The PEAP review and reporting arrangements permit the integration and rationalization o f
reviews and reports at all levels. A tentative review and reporting calendar has been developed,
o f which the main event i s an annual PEAP review meeting in May, involving a wide range o f
domestic and external stakeholders. This meeting will review the evidence o f progress compared
t o the objectives presented in the matrix and agree on an updated version o f the matrix.

Assessing the operational effectiveness of U J A S partners
In addition t o assessing the outcome o f specific interventions a n d their link to country
outcomes, U J A S partners together with the government will support an annual independent
assessment o f progress o f partners in organizational effectiveness. T h i s assessment will b e
based o n the 10 o f the 12 indicators o f progress o f the Paris Declaration presented in table 7.
These have been adapted a n d expanded w h e r e necessary t o suit the context o f Uganda.
W h e r e possible, this assessment will draw on existing mechanisms such as the annual
questionnaire on the alignment o f b u d g e t support with p o v e r t y r e d u c t i o n strategy processes o f
the Special Partnership for A f r i c a , the A f r i c a n Peer R e v i e w M e c h a n i s m of the N e w

PART 2: WORLD BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE PROGRAM

PART 2
World Bank Group Assistance Program
1.

Introduction

The W o r l d Bank Group has supported Uganda’s economic transformation through
1.
policy advice, analytical work, partnerships-with state, non-state actors, and development
partners-and financing. T h i s support has helped to forge a strong partnership between the
Bank and the Government o f Uganda.

Within the context o f the Uganda Joint Assistance Strategy (UJAS), the W o r l d Bank
2.
Group’s strategy aims to help U anda achieve or exceed the targets specified in Uganda’s
2004-08 PEAP and the MDGs?’ In particular, the Bank intends t o continue supporting
efforts to improve service delivery and to reduce nonincome poverty (access t o health,
education, water and sanitation). It will also intensify efforts to reduce income poverty by
expanding support for measures to promote growth. The strategy o f the W o r l d Bank Group
i s laid out in part 1 o f this document, and the details o f i t s programs are elaborated below in
part 2. Parts 1 and 2 together comprise the W o r l d Bank Group’s Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS), with I F C / M I G A support presented in paragraphs 23-29.
3.
The W o r l d Bank i s one o f Uganda’s most important development partners. It
contributes significantly to the provision o f analytic and advisory activities (AAA). I t plays
an important role in promoting partnership, chairing the local development partner group in
Kampala and participating in several important harmonization activities, including
developing the UJAS; undertaking core diagnostic work o n public expenditure management,
financial management, and procurement; and providing combined financial support to the
budget in the form o f general budget support and various sector-wide approaches. The World
Bank also provides more financial resources to the country than any other development
partner.

2.

Implementationo f the last Country Assistance Strategy

The most recent C A S (fiscal 2001-03) discussed by the Board o n November 16,2000
4.
aligned all World Bank support with the government’s reform program as laid out in
Uganda’s 2000 PEAP. The three annual progress reports and the related Joint Staff
Assessments report o n progress in implementing the 2000 PEAP.
A key feature o f W o r l d Bank support to Uganda has been a series o f annual PRSCs,
5.
informed by analytical work and policy advice that focused o n improving the effectiveness o f
service delivery. PRSC 1 and 2 focused o n the effectiveness o f public service delivery
(public sector reform paired with reforms aimed at increasing access to education, health, and
water). PRSC 3 and 4 added rural development.22 PRSCS, which i s presented with this
UJAS, added the focus o n supporting economic growth agenda.

21

The PEAP targets represent the customization o f the o f the MDGs to Uganda’s particular circumstances.
The main feature o f a PRSC i s that it i s recurrent, predictable, and embedded in a programmatic mediumterm policy framework.
22

52

As o f October 2005, Uganda’s portfolio o f IDA-financed operations comprised 20
6.
active programs and projects with total net commitments o f US$1,214 m i l l i o n and an
undisbursed balance o f US$690 million. Support i s provided (as a percentage o f total
commitments) to energy and transport (33 percent), agriculture and environment (15 percent),
private sector and finance (1 5 percent), human development (14 percent), public sector (12
percent) and PRSC (12 percent). Under IDA 13,the Bank provided an average o f just over
US$300 m i l l i o n per year, approximately h a l f o f which was in the form o f budget support
through the PRSCs. The average annual financing commitments and net disbursements
during the last three fiscal years are presented in table 1. Under IDA 14, the Bank expects to
provide at least US$250 m i l l i o n per year during fiscal 2006-09, assuming continued good
performance.23

Lessons learned

Lessons learned from the implementation o f the previous CAS, and articulated in the
7.
CAS Completion Report, are reflected in the design o f the UJAS. These include:

Focus o n promoting rural development i s critical to ensuring that growth raises the
incomes o f the poor. The Bank with other UJAS partners will promote accelerated
implementation o f the Plan for the Modernization o f Agriculture, including further
strengthening o f the linkage between the agricultural research and advisory services.
The Bank and UJAS partners will also promote rural development more broadly
through support for rural infrastructure, health and education services, and improved
management o f natural resources.
Focus o n enhancing the quality o f the services provided to ensure that health and
education outcomes improve, and strengthen linkages between sectors to increase the
effectiveness o f expenditures. The Bank recognizes that improving the quality, and
not just the quantity, o f service delivery i s critical to ensuring that child and maternal
mortality rates fall, primary school completion rates rise, and other health and
education outcomes improve. Bank and U J A S partners’ assistance includes a number
o f interventions aimed at improving quality o f services. Moreover, the Bank and
other partners will continue to support SWAPS in the education, health, and water and
sanitation sectors, which are strengthening the intersectoral linkages, and promoting a
more coordinated approach by all stakeholders, leading to better results in most areas.
Focus more o n raising and sustaining growth. The Bank, together with U J A S partners
will promote growth through investment in infrastructure, support for policy reforms
aimed at making the economy more competitive, and assistance with capacity

building.

Intensify efforts to improve governance. The Bank, with other partners, will support
public sector reforms for accountability and transparency, strengthen anti-corruption
institutions, and deepen the dialogue with government o n governance issues.

Continue providing general budget support, complemented by projects or programs in
relevant sectors. The W o r l d Bank and other UJAS partners will continue providing a
significant proportion o f their assistance through budget support. According to recent
reviews (Bank’s Africa Region, Operations Evaluation Department, DFID, and the
EC) budget support has helped to finance a rapid expansion o f basic services in
education, health, and water and sanitation, while reducing overall transaction costs o f
aid to the government. The Bank will continue to provide budget support in these
areas, while increasingly focusing on support to promote growth. It will also continue
to support analytical work and provide policy advice to fill analytical gaps and to
assist the government without regard to whether it i s provided financing in a
particular area. Consistent with the W o r l d Bank’s Strategic Framework for IDA’S
Assistance to Africa, the Bank will also provide project support in areas where this
modality better responds to the country’s sectoral capacity and performance. For
example, the Bank during the UJAS period, will support public sector reform,
infrastructure investment (especially roads and energy), and private sector
development through project support. The Bank will work closely with the IMF in
developing and monitoring i t s PRSCs to ensure that prior actions are consistent with
those o f the Fund program. It will work with the I F C and with MIGA in providing
financing and technical support for infrastructure and private sector development.

Portfolio management

Portfolio performance during the period o f the previous CAS (fiscal 2001-03) was
8.
satisfactory, with commitments at r i s k falling from 13.1 percent o f the total in fiscal 2001 to
only 2.1 percent (with 100 percent realism) in fiscal 2003. Performance, however, has
deteriorated during the past two fiscal years, due mainly to lack o f timely counterpart funds,
problems in procurement and financial management. During fiscal 2004,29.4 percent o f
commitments were at risk and realism stood at 66.7 percent. The situation improved slightly
during fiscal 2005, with 28.2 percent o f commitments at risk and realism at 71.4 percent.
However, the proactivity index for the portfolio at 100 percent i s w e l l above the Africa target
o f 80 percent and the current Africa average o f 77 percent.

The Bank’s country team has intensified supervision o f the projects, and has agreed
9.
on specific actions with the government, including extending, restructuring, or seeking
additional financing to address issues affecting portfolio performance. The upcoming resultsbased country portfolio performance review (CPPR) will focus o n development outcomes. In
addition to suggesting concrete steps for improving portfolio performance, the CPPR will aim
at improving the alignment o f the country program to the goals and outcomes o f the 2004
PEAP. The CPPR will build o n the findings o f a monitoring and evaluation assessment o f
the portfolio to ensure that the project and program outcomes are captured.
3.

World Bank support for implementationof the 2004 PEAP

The Bank’s proposed program during the UJAS period will continue the current C A S
10.
focus o f support aimed at assisting Uganda to achieve PEAP and MDG outcomes in non-

54

income dimensions o f poverty, such health, education, and water and sanitation. In addition,
the Bank will strengthen support intended to reduce income poverty and inequity, a key
PEAP objective. T o promote growth, the Bank’s assistance throughout the UJAS period will
increasingly focus o n infrastructure, energy, regional initiatives and creation o f capacity in
the public sector. Over the UJAS period, the Bank will periodically revisit the program with
the government to ensure i t s focus remains relevant, and make adjustments as necessary. In
the event such adjustments are major, the Country Team will consult with senior management
and the Board for guidance and endorsement.

During the UJAS period, the Bank will continue i t s support for improved service
11.
delivery and reform o f public services, while increasing i t s support for measures to promote
growth. I t i s harmonizing i t s support with the UJAS partners and other development partners,
selectively engaging in sectors and activities in line with i t s comparative advantage. The
Bank may continue to play a key role in policy dialogue and partnerships even in areas where
the Bank does not provide financial support. Appendix 2 provides details o n the Bank’s
current and planned program.

12.
A comprehensive country economic memorandum under preparation in partnership
with several UJAS partners and the IMF i s identifying drivers o f and constraints to growth.
Preliminary findings suggest that support for energy, roads, and other transport infrastructure,
for deepening o f the financial system, and for adoption o f modem technology will be
important areas to help Uganda overcome constraints to future growth. Support to improve
agricultural productivity and to reduce Uganda’s widening trade deficit by increasing exports
will be also be important to ensure that growth i s widely shared and sustainable. A
diagnostic integrated trade study will identify priorities for expansion o f exports, and the
country economic memorandum will identify priorities for increasing the productivity o f
agriculture. Policies and projects to promote regional integration are also priorities for future
growth in Uganda and in the region as a whole, and the Bank will support a number o f
activities in this area.

Under PEAP pillar 1 (economic management), the Bank in collaboration with the
IMF continues to support macroeconomic stability and to assist the government in
reducing the fiscal deficit. In addition, the Bank aims to assist in reducing Uganda’s
external debt by providing a larger proportion o f i t s assistance through grants and by
monitoring and advising o n the debt situation. The Bank’s ongoing public
expenditure review supports economic management by bringing about changes in
budget performance and monitoring, and contributing to the dialogue o n spending
priorities to achieve PEAP objectives. Planned analytical work includes expenditure
tracking studies, a country economic memorandum, and debt sustainability updates.
PRSCs provide most o f the ongoing and planned financing for this pillar. Ongoing
investment operations include financing in economic and financial management.
Planned operations will focus o n public service performance and local service
delivery.
Under PEAP pillar 2 (enhancing production, competitiveness and incomes), the Bank
supports increasing the value o f exports, increasing the proportion o f agriculture
output that i s marketed, increasing the proportion o f roads in good condition, and
decreasing environmental degradation. The Bank continues i t s big push toward
increasing the productivity and profitability o f both farm and non-farm enterprises to

55

achieve and sustain high economic growth rates. T o attract more private investment,
the Bank will further focus o n reducing the cost o f doing business in Uganda for
domestic and international businesses through various programs aimed at unlocking
private sector activities (for example, increasing access to credit). The Bank will also
be ready to provide necessary assistance if high o i l prices impede economic growth
and poverty reduction. Ongoing AAA includes annual Investors’ Roundtable,
investment climate follow-up studies, and a financial sector assessment follow-up.
Planned AAA in this area includes a stocktaking o f decentralized service delivery,
work related to fiscal and administrative decentralization, periodic value for money
audits, and cost efficiency analysis. Ongoing investment financing includes
agriculture advisory and research, which i s also supported through the PRSC
program. In addition, the Bank currently supports investment financing in
infrastructure (roads and energy), environmental management, privatization and
utility sector reform, regional trade and private sector competitiveness. Planned
financial support includes the PRSC program with an added focus o n private sector
driven growth as well as various investment financing operations in the areas o f
power, transport, trade, roads, science and technology, and natural resources.
Regional integration i s a priority under this pillar. The proposed East Africa
Community Regional Trade and Transport Facilitation Project will support
investment in infrastructure as well as improved policies and institutions to promote
regional economic integration. Other proposed regional projects include Lake
Victoria 2, the East Africa Regional Power Pool Project, and a regional
communications infrastructure project.
a

Under pillar 3 (security, conflict resolution and disaster management), the Bank
supports programs aimed at helping internally displaced people resettle in former
conflict areas. Planned AAA under this pillar includes a public expenditure review
for northern Uganda, poverty and social impact assessment o n reform o f the local
level tax system and o f land policy, and a joint needs assessment for the north.
Ongoing financial support i s through the Northern Uganda Social Action Fund. In
anticipation that the government’s recovery and development plan for northern
Uganda requires additional resources, a future Community Development Fund i s in
the pipeline for fiscal 2008. In turn, the Bank i s working closely with UJAS partners
who provide additional and more focused support under this pillar. In addition, the
Multi-Country Demobilization and Reintegration Program i s supporting the
reintegration o f ex-combatants into society in the countries o f the Great Lakes region
and lays the foundation for development and poverty reduction in northern Uganda.

a

Under pillar 4 (good governance), the Bank supports programs to enhance public
financial management (particularly, to increase the percentage o f ministries and local
governments preparing regular financial statements), and to reduce the incidence o f
corruption. Current analytical work includes various relevant sector reviews, focusing
o n the justice, law, and order sector; public services; decentralization; and anticorruption; and reform o f procurement, public financial management, and auditing
systems. Ongoing financial support under this pillar includes the PRSC program and
investment financing in economic and financial management, and local government.
Future support will be provided through the PRSC program and through projects in
public service performance, urban institutional infrastructure, and local service
delivery.

56

0

Under pillar 5 (human development), the Bank supports programs aimed at increasing
primary net enrolment and primary completion rates (through enhancements in quality
o f education), and increasing the percentage o f the population with access to safe
water and sanitation services. In addition, the Bank supports programs to reduce
infant and maternal mortality rates, H I V / A I D S prevalence rates, and the incidence o f
malaria and tuberculosis. Planned financing in health, education, and water will be
provided mainly through the PRSC program and through projects in public and local
service delivery, and in community-driven development. This financing will focus o n
enhancing accountability for service delivery, and o n ensuring that the poor and
disadvantaged groups have access to basic services and economic opportunities.
Support for science and technology and tertiary education will support the growth
agenda. Ongoing and planned AAA includes a water sector and sanitation review, in
addition to sector reviews in health and education. The country economic
memorandum will explore in depth the implications o f high population growth rates
for Uganda’s development and will propose policies to enable the country t o meet the
challenges.

Bank financing during fiscal 2006-09 i s expected to average US$250 m i l l i o n in new
13.
commitments annually. Activities under pillar 1 and 2 will receive the greatest proportion o f
new financing, in line with the increased UJAS focus o n growth. The second largest
contribution i s the support to pillar 4 (governance), which will enable the private sector to
flourish and contribute to growth. Pillar 5 (human development) receives the third highest
support from the Bank’s program, to fight impediments to growth, share the benefits o f
growth, and address equity concerns due to l o w levels o f health and education. H I V / A I D S
and malaria.prevention efforts will feature prominently in the Bank’s program.
World Bank financing

14.
Determining the overall level and nature of support. IDA allocations will be
determined annually based o n the performance based allocation system, which includes the
Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) rating, and measures o f annual portfolio
performance, including procurement. Uganda has maintained a high CPIA overall score
among the Sub-Saharan Africa countries for the past three years, reflecting i t s commitment to
reform and delivery o f results.
Total Bank financial support during fiscal 2006-09 i s envisaged to be US$l,OOO
15.
million, including a firm allocation for fiscal 2006 and indicative allocations for fiscal 2007
and fiscal 2008. Lending limits are determined annually based o n the IDA 14 performancebased allocation system, which in turn depends o n country performance, the performance o f
all IDA borrowers, the size o f the available IDA envelop, and the country’s grant eligibility.
Because Uganda i s currently classified as a moderate risk country in terms o f debt
sustainability, it qualifies for up to 45 percent o f i t s fiscal 2006 IDA allocation in grants. The
lending limits, choice o f lending instruments, and share o f grants will be adjusted as
necessary following implementation o f the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). In
keeping with the harmonization agenda, the PEAP, and the preferences o f the Ugandan
authorities, the Bank intends to provide about 50 percent o f annual commitments through
continuation o f the series o f annual PRSCs.

57

16.
The W o r l d Band has the flexibility to lower actual commitments during the course o f
the fiscal year if government performance in key areas deteriorates. In collaboration with the
other UJAS partners, the Bank will assess government performance o n the basis o f the
financing scenario assessment framework presented in table 5 o f the UJAS. I t will lower
actual commitments if performance in economic management deteriorates significantly,
conflict within the region resurges, commitment to improved governance and enhanced
public financial management wanes, and implementation o f the Bank-supported program
deteriorates significantly. If key indicators deteriorate, the Bank would reduce i t s financing
by up to 30 percent, determined o n the basis o f the extent o f the deterioration. The decision
to move to lowering actual commitments will entail intensive discussions with government to
ensure that key PEAP priorities are protected, including basic service delivery for the poor,
programs to reduce the spread o f HIV/AIDS, and measures to strengthen accountability
institutions. The conditions under which the Bank and other U J A S partners will lower actual
commitments and i t s implications are described in paragraphs 87 and 88 o f the UJAS.

’

Several mechanisms are in place for monitoring and evaluating the government’s
17.
implementation o f i t s reforms and poverty reduction strategy. First, development partners
consult with the government regularly through a number o f well established sector working
groups to review budget execution and progress with implementing sector strategies. Second,
the Local Donors Group takes stock o f overall implementation o f the PEAP, including
performance in budget execution. This helps to harmonize dialogue with the government and
to reach consistent positions in response to possible deterioration in performance. Third,
sector dialogue and reviews feed into the government’s monitoring and evaluation framework
for the implementation o f the PEAP. These are n o w being consolidated into a common
evaluation mechanism anchored in the PEAP policy and results matrix. Fourth, budget
support donors actively participate in the discussions held during preparation o f the PRSCs to
identify and resolve potential problems in the implementation o f i t s prior actions.
Development partners use all opportunities to gauge government commitment t o reform and,
if needed, to agree o n corrective actions. These processes complement the UJAS annual
review mechanism, which will take place at the end o f each fiscal year.
18.
Depending o n Uganda’s future performance, additional external financial resources
from the development community may become available to Uganda to support faster progress
and scale-up towards the MDGs. The Uganda Country Economic Memorandum currently
under preparation will analyze the potential uses o f such additional financing as well as i t s
impact on inflation, the real exchange rate, domestic debt, and aid dependency. T h e study
will also include a fiscal sustainability analysis-based o n the government’s long-term
expenditure framework-to assess the need for aid o n the basis o f projections o f population
growth, economic activity, tax revenues, debt relief and public spending. I t will review the
evidence o f past aid flows o n the competitiveness o f Uganda’s economy (Dutch disease
effects) and analyze the potential costs and benefits to the economy o f an increased transfer
o f real resources. It will recommend approaches to minimize any short-term negative effects
on the exchange rate from absorbing and spending additional aid, while using higher aid
flows to increase productivity and maintain the competitiveness o f the economy. The study
in addition will assess priorities to overcome constraints to absorptive capacity in the labour
market and in specific infrastructure subsectors.

58

Potential risks

19.
Risks to the implementation o f the PEAP and o f the UJAS are presented in table 5 o f
the UJAS. These include risks related to the political transition, poor governance, inadequate
protection o f human rights and limited access to justice, the continuing conflict in northern
Uganda, weak public sector capacity, high population growth, and external shocks. An
additional r i s k for programs supported by the Bank arises from the possibility that other
development partners significantly reduce their assistance in response to concerns about
political governance. The Bank will work actively with other partners and with the
government t o mitigate the risks. It will also be very open and transparent regarding the
factors that will lead to an increase or decline in assistance.
Assessing results of the World Bank Group program

20.
In addition to participating in the implementation reviews o f the PEAP and the UJAS,
the W o r l d Bank Group will assess the results o f i t s specific interventions through more
intensified outcome-oriented management o f the portfolio. In operationalizing the UJAS, the
Bank in collaboration with the government and other development partners will further refine
i t s results framework presented in appendix 1. This framework will establish a more direct
link between specific PEAP goals to govemment-led outcomes, and the contribution o f Bank
outputs to these outcomes. As necessary during the implementation o f the UJAS, the Bank in
consultation with the government and others, may decide to adjust programs to better
contribute to achievement o f PEAP outcomes. T h e Bank’s support for developing and
implementing the National Integrated Monitoring and Evaluation Strategy (NIMES), through
lending and technical assistance, will be an integral part o f results-based monitoring.
Capacity development

21,
The Africa Region Operational Taskforce o n Capacity Development in Africa
considers Uganda to be a country with momentum for comprehensive transformation o f state
effectiveness. This transfonnation started in the late 1980s and continued to the late 1990s,
during which indicators o f human capacity and state effectiveness and openness significantly
improved. However, momentum appears to have recently slowed. T o help Uganda regain
the momentum, the Bank, including the W o r l d Bank Institute, and other U J A S partners will
continue to support development o f capacity through harmonized approaches to financing,
analytical work, and policy advice. They will support PRSCs and SWAPS,proven to be
effective approaches to build capacity. Specific investment lending in ongoing and planned
operations will support improvements in Ugandan public sector reform, public financial
management, and governance at all levels o f government.

program in Uganda supports the government in implementing 23 out o f 25 objectives o f the
Africa Action Plan. The only objective where the Bank i s not providing direct support i s in
reforming the legal and judicial systems, because o f the comparative advantage o f other
UJAS partners in this particular area. In addition, the Bank does not directly contribute to the
objective o f building capacity o f post-conflict countries, simply because Uganda i s not a
country in that category. However, the Bank plans to contribute to increased security and
reconstruction efforts in northern Uganda through the UJAS. See appendix 4 for the
complete set o f focal areas in the Africa Action Plan.

The majority o f new commitments (37 percent) will go to actions supporting the
drivers o f growth.
Support for improved governance will comprise 33 percent o f new commitments.
Support to participating in and sharing o f growth will amount to 30 percent.

Donor harmonization

Another important strategic development goal highlighted in the Africa Action Plan i s
24.
to build effective partnerships at the country level with clients and other development
partners. The Bank i s collaborating with other development partners to increasingly
harmonize support through provision o f budget support and support for SWAPS. The Bank i s
offering analytical work and policy advice in sectors such as health, education, and water and
sanitation delinked from specific investment credits in these sectors, because o f i t s strengths
in AAA. T h e Bank i s also supporting joint advisory and analytic activities. Recent examples
of this include the country integrated fiduciary assessment, periodic gender analyses, the
country economic memorandum currently under preparation, and the upcoming diagnostic
trade integration study. As described in detail in part 1 o f this document, the Bank i s also
working closely with other development partners to rationalize i t s engagement further in line
with i t s comparative advantage.

Program o f the International Finance Corporation fiscal 2006-09

The International Finance Corporation (IFC) traditionally played a k e y role in Uganda
25.
in the area o f telecommunications, infrastructure, especially electricity, privatization, and
deepening o f the financial sector. Over the UJAS period, the IFC will continue t o focus o n
i t s traditional key areas o f support.
In the context o f a new public-private partnership, the IFC, the Bank, and the
26.
government are coordinating efforts o n alternative strategies to implement the Bujagali
Project. T h i s will involve the development, construction, operation, and maintenance o f a
250 megawatt run-of-the-river hydropower plant and the construction management o f a high
voltage transmission line. The I F C i s the advisor to the governments o f Uganda and Kenya
in the privatization o f the joint Kenya-Uganda railway concession. The process has been
successfully camed out and the South African led-consortium Sheltam-Comazar w o n the
concession. Signing i s scheduled for December 2005.

27.
The I F C provided technical assistance advisory services to the government to carry
out a study on mortgage finance and housing sector development. As a result o f the study,
the I F C i s investigating further relationships with the Development Finance Company o f
Uganda. The I F C has also committed US$lO million to help the Development Finance
Company o f Uganda meet i t s urgent need for sustainable long-term finance to promote its
mortgage and term finance products. Discussions with other financial institutions regarding
provision o f long-term funding and trade finance facilities are ongoing.

28.
Uganda i s also one o f the pilot countries in the Medium, Small, and M i c r o Enterprise
(MSME) initiative, a joint I D N I F C pilot program to support MSMEs in Sub-Saharan Africa
over the next three to four years. In addressing the main constraints to the development o f
MSMEs in Africa, the initiative will support three types o f programs: (a) those that will
increase MSME’s access to finance; (b) those that will increase MSME’s access t o business
development services; and (c) those that will improve the business environment for MSMEs.

P r o g r a m o f the M u l t i l a t e r a l Investment Guarantee Agency fiscal 2006-09

Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) guarantees

MIGA’s focus in Uganda i s o n energy and agribusiness. The current portfolio
29.
comprises two guarantee operations: the restructuring o f the Afriproduce agribusiness, and
the provision o f guarantees for Eskom EnterprisedSouth Africa and C D C GlobeleqmK in
relation to the privatization o f Uganda’s country’s electricity grid.
Over the UJAS period, MIGA will focus o n successful completion o f the Bujagali
30.
hydroelectric power project. MIGA expects to provide a significant amount o f guarantees to
private sector investors. MIGA will liaise closely with the Bank and continue to follow the
Bank’s lead in the reform o f the energy sector. In addition to large infrastructure investments,
MIGA maintains an interest in smaller investments in MSMEs, especially in the apparel,
textile, telecom, tourism and agri-business sectors. The identification o f potential projects for
guarantee support in these sectors i s largely coordinated through MIGA’s technical assistance
program with the Uganda Investment Authority (UIA).
M I G A nonguarantee services

MIGA has worked consistently with Uganda’s Investment Authority o n various
3 1,
capacity building programs over the years. Recently, the agency was featured as one o f four
best-practice investment promotion agencies in a joint publication o f M I G N F o r e i g n
Investment Advisory Services: “Competing for Foreign Direct Investment.” In addition,
Uganda i s one o f the countries covered by MIGA’s Africa enterprise benchmarking program.
A program, which i s linked to the Bank’s investment climate assessment. Building on
enterprise benchmarking program results, MIGA i s working with UIA to secure donor
funding for an investment outreach program.

Conclusions

The next four years will be a critical period for Uganda, which faces a number o f
32.
challenges o n the economic, social and political front. Business as usual will not be
sufficient to put the country o n a path to reach the necessary growth rates for achieving the
PEAP and MDG targets. A comprehensive effort by the government for a more accountable
public sector, with structural reform for economic growth, and efficient leadership and
commitment in governance reforms i s necessary to enable Uganda to become a middle
income country by 2015. The Bank Group will support Uganda’s efforts to attain PEAP and
MDG targets by:

Appendix 5: Joint Fund-World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis (December 2005)
Uganda’s risk of debt distress i s moderate. I t s net present value (NPV) o f debt-to1,
exports ratio stands at 179 percent in 2004/05, or below i t s policy-dependent threshold o f
200 percent, but this threshold i s breached under various stress tests during the projection
period. Debt-service payments remain manageable at about 16 percent o f exports in 2004/05.
T h e implementation o f the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDFU) would provide
additional debt r e l i e f that could decrease Uganda’s N P V o f debt-to-exports ratio to 46 percent
in 2006/07.28 The Fund-World Bank staff agreed that this joint debt sustainability analysis
(DSA) will focus mainly on Uganda’s situation before the full implementation o f the MDRI,
as certain technical aspects o f International Development Association (IDA) and African
Development Fund (AfDF) debt relief are not yet defined. A reassessment o f Uganda’s debt
‘
sustainability after implementation o f MDRI may become necessary once the technical
details with respect to the Initiative are finalized.

2.
This joint DSA has been prepared using the Fund-World Bank debt
sustainability framework for low-income countries. The debt data underlyingthis DSA
was updated jointly by the Ugandan authorities and the World Bank in July 2005. N e w
’
information on some creditors that became available after 2002 has been i n ~ l u d e d . ~The
macro economic framework i s based on the Fund’s macro framework agreed with the
authorities during the discussions for the Policy Support Instrument (PSI) in October 2005.30

Uganda graduated from the HIPC Initiative with an NPV of debt-to-exports o f
3.
171 percent in 2000/Ol.3’ A D S A for Uganda for 2002, using the HIPC methodology,
projected that Uganda’s N P V o f debt-to-exports ratio would continue to increase from
2000/01 onwards, peaking at 209 percent in 2002/03 and declining to 198 percent in 2004/05.
The current DSA, however, shows that Uganda’s N P V o f debt-to-exports ratio, based on the
HIPC methodology, would have amounted to 229 percent in 2004/05, exceeding projections
by about 3 1 percentage points (Text Table 1). The depreciation o f the U S dollar explains the
bulk o f the increase in the N P V o f debt-to-exports ratio, raising it by more than 41 percentage
points.

These figures are based on the assumption that debt relief under the MDRI i s provided on debt outstanding as
o f end-2004 for IMF and Africa Development Fund and as of end-2003 for IDA. In addition, i t i s assumed that
the MDRI will be implemented by the IMF and the Africa Development Fund in January 2006, and by IDA in
July 2006. Any possible effect on disbursement projections has been ignored. Uganda had received US$1.95
billion in total debt service relief under the HIPC Initiative, out of which US1.3 billion under the Enhanced
HIPC Initiative.
The new data refers to bilateral non-Paris Club creditors, as well as the East African Development Bank and
the Islamic Development Bank.

Uganda’s debt burden indicators remain below their policy-dependent
thresholds throughout the projection period under the baseline scenario.33The N P V o f
debt-to-GDP ratio amounts to 24 percent in 2004/05, lying well below i t s policy-dependent
threshold o f 50 percent. I t i s projected to decline continuously thereafter, dropping below 13
percent by the end o f the projection period.34Uganda’s N P V o f debt-to-exports ratio in
2004/05 amounts to 179 percent, below i t s policy-dependent debt burden threshold. Debtservice payments continue to be manageable, reflecting the delivery o f HIPC assistance as
well as the fact that most o f Uganda’s debt has been contracted o n concessional terms.
The Low-Income Countries (LIC) DSA methodology differs from the HIPC on a number o f aspects, notably
on (i)the current year exports are used as denominators for estimating debt-to-exports ratio rather than the
backward-lookingthree-year moving average o f exports; (ii)
the use o f the W E 0 exchange rate projections
instead o f exchange rates at the end o f the base year; and (iii)
a 5 percent discount rate instead o f currency
specific discount rates.
32

Uganda’s policies and institutions rank as a “strong performer” according to the latest World Bank’s Country
Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA). Under this rank policy-dependent debt burden thresholds are NPV
of debt to GDP ratio o f 50 percent, NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio of 200 percent, NPV of debt to revenue ratio o f
300 percent, debt service to exports ratio of 25 percent and debt service to revenue ratio of 35 percent.
34 Similarly, the NPV o f debt-to-revenue o f 187 percent in 2004/05 i s well below its policy-dependentthreshold.
33

76

Uganda’s debt service-to-exports ratio was 16 percent in 2004/05 and i s projected to decline
to 6 percent by 2010/11.
Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions
Real GDP growth averages 6 percent between 2006 and 2025, equal to i t s ten-year historical average.

Exports o f goods and services are projected to grow about 9 percent on average between 2005/06 and
20 10/11, driven largely b y an increase in the export volume o f fish, maize, cotton and coffee. After
2010/11 export growth slows down to about 7 percent.
The current account deficit (including official transfers) in terms o f GDP i s above i t s historical average
of 4.7 percent by about 0.4 percent o f GDP between 2005/06-20104 1 and i s projected to increase to 5.5
percent on average thereafter.
Fiscal policy. Tax revenues are assumed to increase gradually from 13 percent o f GDP 2004/05 to 15
percent o f GDP in 2010/11 and thereafter. With grants tapering o f f t o about 4.5 percent, noninterest
expenditures are projected to decline gradually to a level o f 18.5 percent o f GDP, consistent with a
primary deficit o f 1 percent o f GDP in the outer years.
Official external loan financing i s projected to amount to US$350 million on average throughout the
entire projection period. The D S A assumes that only IDA grants committed before June 2005 will be

6.
Adverse macroeconomic shocks would worsen Uganda’s N P V o f debt-to-exports
ratio significantly. If exports were to grow less by one standard deviation in 2006/07,
Uganda’s N P V o f debt-to-exports ratio would jump up to 208 percent in 2006/07. An export
shock would have long lasting negative effects o n Uganda’s debt dynamics, keeping the N P V
o f debt-to-exports ratio above 200 percent until 2020/21. However, Uganda’s N P V o f debtto-exports ratio would remain below i t s policy-dependent threshold when key
macroeconomic variables are set at their historical average.

7.

Imprudent debt management would worsen Uganda’s N P V o f debt-to-exports
ratio significantly. If new borrowing were to be contracted o n less concessional terms during
the projection period, Uganda’s NPV o f debt-to-ex orts ratio would increase substantially.
Reducing the grant element by 8 percentage points would lead to an increase in the N P V o f
debt-to-exports ratio by 17 percentage points in 201 1/12.

ps

Uganda i s projected to continue to rely heavily on donor support in order to
8.
finance its projected current account deficit. In 2004/05 net donor support amounts to 9.4
percent o f GDP, with grants constituting approximately 8.4 percent o f GDP.

111. FISCALSUSTAINABILITY

ANALYSIS

The fiscal DSA i s based on the assumption of continued fiscal consolidation in
9.
the context o f lower grant inflows. Specifically, i t i s assumed that grants will decline from
about 8.5 percent o f GDP in 2004/05 to about 5 percent o f GDP during the projection period,
reflecting increased autonomy from donor support. Domestic public revenues are projected to
rise to 15 percent o f GDP, from currently at 13 percent, reflecting authorities’ efforts to raise
domestic revenues. T h i s should allow noninterest public expenditures to level o f f at about
18.5 percent o f GDP, while limiting the deficit o f the primary balance to 1 percent o f GDP.
35

This would correspond to an increase in the average interest rate on new disbursements by 1 percentage point.

77

Under the baseline scenario, N P V o f public debt i s projected to decline from 36
10.
percent o f GDP in 200415 to about 1 1 percent at the end o f the projection period. In terms o f
public sector revenues, the N P V o f Uganda’s public debt under the baseline scenario remains
at about 160 percent in the first several years. After 2010, reflecting continued fiscal
consolidation, the decline o f the N P V o f debt-to-revenue ratio accelerates, and falls to about
60 percent at the end o f the projection period. Debt-service indicators also seem to remain
manageable.

11.
Uganda’s achievement of public debt sustainability remains valid even under
alternative scenarios and most o f them continue to decline over the projection period. It i s
noticeable that under the nonreform scenario, which assumes unchanged primary balance
from 2004/05, debt indicators remain better than under the baseline scenario.
Standard bound tests suggests that under the standardized alternative shocks,
12.
N P V o f Uganda’s public debt stays below 40 percent o f GDP. The 30 percent one-time
depreciation shock takes the N P V o f debt to 40 percent o f GDP and 200 percent o f revenues,
but after about ten years the two indicators returns to figures close to the baseline.

IV. THEEFFECTS
OF MDRI
Uganda i s at a moderate risk of debt distress before the implementation o f the
13.
MDRI. W h i l e all debt burden indicators are below their policy-dependent debt burden
thresholds under the baseline, Uganda remains vulnerable to exogenous shocks. The MDRI

and conditions for financing the project are not finished, the staffs have prepared a DSA
scenario, in which it i s assumed that Bujagali would be financed on commercial terms and

increases by 6 percentage points in 2015. However, if a combination o f shocks impact

The MDRI scenario assumes that disbursement projections remain the same as under the baseline. Netting out

78

Uganda, the N P V o f debt-to-exports ratio would increase by 11 percentage points to 247
percent in 20 15. These risks show the importance o f maintaining a prudent debt management
policy even under the debt relief scenario.
15.
The full implementationo f the MDRI would substantially lower Uganda’s
probability of debt distress. The debt relief under the MDRI would decrease Uganda’s N P V
o f debt-to-exports ratio to 46 percent in 2006/07 from 179 percent in 2004/05 while the debt
service to export ratio would sharply decrease to 4 percent in 2006/07 from 16 percent in
2004/05. Uganda’s N P V debt-to-GDP ratio will be reduced to 7 percent in 2006/07 from 24
percent in 2004/05.

V. CONCLUSION
Uganda’s risk of debt distress before the full implementationo f the MDRI i s
16.
moderate. It will be better protected against the risk o f debt distress by embarking upon a
second generation o f structural reforms. These reforms will help diversify the export base and
strengthen export competitiveness. While these measures would reduce Uganda’s
vulnerability to exogenous shocks, the implementation o f prudent debt management policies
and efficient allocation of donor support would be required in order to ensure that debt
burden indicators remain l o w in the long-term.

Appendix 7: Uganda CAS Completion Report
Document Date o f FYO1-03 CAS: December 18,2000
Board Approval Date: November 16,2000
Period covered by the C A S Completion Report: FY 200 1-2005
CAS Completion Report by: Johannes Widmann, Operations Analyst (ETC), AFCTZ
Overview

1. This C A S Completion Report (CAS CR) represents a self-assessment o f the outcomes achieved under
the last Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Uganda, covering FYO1-05, and evaluates the Bank’s
contribution toward these outcomes. The drafting o f the C A S C R has been a consultative process, wellaligned with the drafting o f the new Uganda Joint Assistance Strategy (UJAS).37 A f i r s t draft o f the C A S
C R was presented to the Country Team, the Country Management Unit, Sector Managers, and
representatives from OED and OPCS at a UJAS workshop in Washington, D.C. in January 2004. The
extensive comments received were incorporated into a second draft dated M a y 2004, which was shared
in-country with development partners and government. Comments fkom all stakeholders have been
incorporated into a third draft in October 2004, which was again shared with the Country Team and
OPCS for final inputs. A final update o f the report, reflecting latest developments, was done during fall
2005.
2. The report i s organized in four parts:
(i.) Part A discusses the alignment o f the Bank’s strategy with Uganda’s long-term strategic
goals;
(ii.) Part B-the main part o f the report-focuses on intermediate outcomes during the C A S
period and tries to assess in h o w far Bank assistance contributed toward progress under each
pillar o f Uganda’s Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP);

(iii.) Part C discusses evaluations o f the Bank’s performance over the C A S period;
(iv.)

Part D provides lessons learned and highlights the issues that, based o n this report, will be
dealt with in the new UJAS.

3. The main analysis in Part B gives a mixed message about the Bank’s contribution to CAS outcomes
over the CAS period (FYO1-2005). I t s main conclusions under each pillar o f the 2000 PEAP are:
0

Pillar 1 (directly increasing the ability o f the poor to raise their incomes): Alignment o f the CAS
with the Plan for the Modernization o f Agriculture (PMA) provided the right focus for reaching
the country’s poor. However, despite inconsistency in poverty numbers between the two latest
household surveys, which do not allow for definite conclusion on changes in the status o f poverty
during the CAS period, more concrete actions to address prevailing income inequalities and
create income generating measures within and outside o f agriculture are warranted.

~~

The C A S formally covered only FY01-03 (there has been n o C A S Progress Report). There has been considerable
delay in the delivery o f the n e w Uganda Joint Assistance Strategy (UJAS) attributable to: the delay in the
preparation o f the government’s updated Poverty Eradication A c t i o n Plan (PEAP) and the longer drafting period
required for the UJAS itself given the innovative approach o f the n e w strategy (drafted by the B a n k and seven other
development partners).

Pillar 2 (directly increasing the quality o f the life o f the poor): The CAS contributed to major
improvements in safe water and, albeit at a slower pace, sanitation coverage. During the C A S
period, people with access to safe water in rural areas increased from 50 percent in FYOO t o 57
percent in FY04; and from 54 percent in FYOO to 67 percent in F Y 0 4 in urban areas. In addition,
there has been good progress in output indicators in health and education. For example, the
percentage o f health centers with trained staff increased from 40 percent in FYO1 to 68 percent in
FY05 and the pupil-teacher ratio improved from 65: 1 in FYOO to 54:l in FY03. However, there
remain challenges for the Bank to support quality and not just the quantity o f service delivery in
health and education.
Pillar 3 (creating an enabling environment for economic growth and structural transformation):
The shift to budget support under the PRSC program and the strong link o f the PRSCs with the
Public Expenditure Review and Medium Term Expenditure Framework process effectively
improved budget predictability, enhanced accountability, and improved the impact o f public
expenditures. Growth has been 5.5 percent o n average in fiscal 200 1-2005, falling short o f the 7
percent growth rate as envisaged by the 2000 CAS. T h i s shortfall i s largely due t o external
shocks, e.g. droughts, plant diseases and commodity price changes. The Government, together
with the Bank and other development partners, will therefore have to find more and better ways
to improve and sustain growth.
Pillar 4 (ensuring good governance and security): Indicators for the incidence o f corruption seem
t o have improved slightly, albeit these changes are not statistically significant. According t o the
National Integrity Survey in 2003,23 percent o f Ugandans perceived the incidence o f corruption
in various sectors. Corruption remains high and overall progress in governance and public sector
reforms remains slow. The Bank will have t o continue to support public sector reforms for
accountability and transparency, strengthen anti-corruption institutions, and deepen the dialogue
with Government o n governance issues. Security issues persist, having a negative impact o n the
overall development progress in Uganda.
Long-Term Strategic Goals, CAS Objectives and CAS Implementation

4. The overarching goal o f the government o f Uganda i s to develop policies and resource allocations
aimed at reducing the incidence o f income poverty (headcount index) from 44 percent in 1997 to 10
percent or less by the year 2017. In addition, the Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP), first issued in
1997 and revised in spring 2000 (the third PEAP, which i s basis for the UJAS, was discussed by the IDA
Board in July 2005), sets forth the specific goals o f achieving and enhancing the quality o f universal
primary education, and primary health care. Besides, the 2000 PEAP ". ..aim[ed] to implement further
administrative and political reforms, which will increase poor people's control over their own lives and
the policies and services which affect them".

5, A summary o f the 2000 PEAP was presented to the Boards o f the Bank and the IMF in M a y 2000 and
recognized as i t s PRSP when Uganda was considered for debt relief under the enhanced HIPC i n i t i a t i ~ e . ~ '
Progress o f the second PEAP has been reported annually by the Government in consultation with i t s
stakeho1de1-s.~~
The PEAP i s a medium-term development plan to guide government policy and the

38 Uganda was the f i r s t country to be declared eligible and to benefit from the HIPC Initiative (in April 1998) and
was also among the first countries to be declared eligible for debt relief under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative. In May
2000, i t reached the Completion Point under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative.
39 Since the Uganda PEAPPRSP, presented in March 2000, the Government o f Uganda has published three PRSP
Progress Reports, in March 2001, March 2002 and April 2003,, each followed by a Joint IDA-IMF Assessment.

development o f detailed sector and district plans. Although the PEAP preceded the PRSP process, the two
are fully consistent.

6. The C A S fully integrated the objectives o f the 2000 PEAP and was organized around the four PEAP
pillars:

(i) directly increasing the ability o f the poor to raise their incomes;
(ii) directly increasing the quality o f the life o f the poor;
(iii)creating an enabling environment for economic growth and structural transformation, and;
(iv)

ensuring good governance and ~ecurity.~’

7. In an emphatic shift from “business as usual”, conducted primarily through the Ministry o f Finance,
the C A S looked to engage spending ministries and civil society in the development effort and shift
lending modalities to “disburse against progress in policy and institutional reforms”. Poverty Reduction
Support Credits (PRSC) were, implicitly at least, the preferred lending option, with self-standing projects
restricted to “capacity building and infrastructure investments directly targeted to poverty alleviation and
private sector development”, and where institutional strengthening was needed for improved service
delivery. Selectivity was to be achieved through a concentration on areas covered by the PEAP
(specifically support to the four PEAP pillars), and through relinquishing the lead to other donors in
selected areas.41

40 The pillars in the C A S were listed in different order than in the PEAP, which listed “creating a framework for
economic growth and structural transformation” and “strengthening good governance and security” as the f i r s t and
second pillar respectively.
4’ Examples include rural and microcredit, where U S A I D took the lead, and the legal sector, where support for the
development o f a sector wide approach was provided by DFID, NORAD, and the Netherlands.

Box 1: Uganda’s Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) Program

The Uganda PRSC has been a frontier program for the World Bank. Uganda was the first
recipient o f a W o r l d Bank PRSC.42 The first Uganda PRSC framework was intended to serve a
variety o f different purposes: 1) to support Government’s implementation o f the PEAP; 2) as a
basis for dialogue with development partners; and 3) as a monitoring framework for PEAP
outcomes. The framework reinforced Government’s leadership and Government’s coordination
and implementation systems. As a frontier program, the first PRSCs suffered from a lack o f
experience resulting in a less than fully developed PRSC framework. However, the PRSC has
evolved over time and i s n o w considered to be highly advanced and meaningful.
The evolving PRSC framework i s reflected in the increase o f PRSC objectives and widening o f
the scope o f policy dialogue. PRSC 1 and 2 focused on three objectives: (i)
Promote the efficient,
improve governance through cross-cutting public sector
equitable use o f public resources; (ii)
reforms (public service and pay, procurement, financial management, transparency, participation,
improve access to and quality o f education, health care, and WSS
anti-comption); and (iii)
services. PRSC 3 added a fourth objective: (iv) create an enabling environment for rural
development (improve effectiveness o f agricultural marketing, research and advisory services)
and promote rural finance, rural roads and sustainable natural resource management. PRSCS
(FY06) i s adding (v) growth, e.g. increased and more efficient private sector production, as
another PRSC objective.

A recent independent joint evaluation o f General Budget Support (more than h a l f o f which i s
through the PRSC) concludes that in Uganda, “[general budget support] has been an efficient and
effective means o f delivering aid, which has contributed to poverty reduction by supporting a
national poverty reduction strategy”.43 The PRSC program contributed to financing a rapid
expansion o f basic public services, fuelling decentralization in the process. In addition to concrete
outcomes (see section B) it also had a positive effect at broader levels. For example, the
coordination o f the PRSC as a part o f general budget support with other donors and its alignment
with government objectives (backed by strong plan-budget links in the government system) had
strong effects o n harmonization and alignment. It helped to bring a wider range o f issues, and
Development Partners, into the dialogue and has reduced the overall transaction costs while
strengthening public financial management systems.

8. In light o f Uganda’s track record o f maintaining macroeconomic stability and “its demonstrated
ability to live up to i t s commitments”, continuation o f a high-case lending mode was recommended.
These factors were also considered to militate against moderate government deviations from agreed
programs and reduced growth. Consequently only two scenarios were articulated, with security
considerations being the most likely to compel a move t o a low-case mode. The high case scenario would
entail commitments o f U S $ 1 billion and the low-case U S $ 3 0 0 m i l l i o n over a three-year period. Specific
triggers were identified for a move to the l o w case, but a base case scenario was not considered likely.
Articulated as risks to the continued high levels o f growth and the strategy were: exogenous shocks
(droughts, plant diseases and commodity price changes), institutional capacity weaknesses, corruption,
PRSC 1 was approved in M a y 2001.
Lister, Stephen et al: Joint Evaluation of General Budget Support (1994-2004), Uganda Country Report, Draft

they disbursed U S $ 7 3 0 m i l l i o n between FY00-FY04 ( U S 4 5 0 m i l l i o n fiom PRSC1-3). Other forms o f budget
support include sector budget support (notionally earmarked t o a particular sector) and PAF general budget support
(notionally earmarked to the PAF).

HIV/AIDS, and political transition. Projects to be included in the Bank’s lending program were to be
designed t o support PEAP pillars while the ESW would inform the Government and stakeholders o f
issues arising f r o m the pursuit o f the Government’s strategic development objectives.

9. Overall, the high-case lending mode, with US$ 940 million o f commitments over the C A S period, has
been realized. The actual lending program was slightly below the originally anticipated program o f U S $
996.3 m i l l i o n due to the lower than anticipated amount o f PRSC 1 and PRSC 2 and the slippage o f the
Capacity and Performance Enhancement Program (CAPEP), which will be delivered in FY06 instead o f
FY02. The deviations from the original lending program are, however, largely offset by additional
projects and higher lending amounts for planned projects (see Annex Table 2 for planned lending
program and actual deliveries). The US$ 100 million Bujagali Hydropower project, which failed t o be
delivered, was designed as a partial risk guarantee and did therefore have n o effect o n the lending
program.
As can be seen from Table 1, Uganda’s economy during the CAS period according to most
10.
indicators - the growth rate being the most notable exception - performed better than anticipated under
the C A S high-case lending mode. Inflation was well below 5 percent in the first two years, but increased
above the high-case lending mode in FY03. Reserves covered an average o f 6.2 months o f imports over
the C A S period, well above the benchmark o f 5 months o f import coverage. In addition, the Poverty
Action Fund (PAF), which was set up in 1997 to earmark savings from the Heavily Indebted Poor
Country Initiative (HIPC) and which supports the M e d i u m Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), the
Government’s main budgeting tool, has increased significantly more than anticipated over the C A S
period.44

11.
However, some o f the risks that had originally been articulated were realized, e.g. continuously
high levels o f insecurity in northern Uganda, the impact o f prolonged dry weather conditions o n
agricultural output, lower growth in food crops, changes in the terms o f trade (particularly coffee prices)
and higher fuel prices. These factors directly influenced growth rates, which however remained w e l l
above the Sub-Saharan average GDP growth rate o f 3.8 percent in 2000-2004, but did not result in a shift
in strategy, which was s t i l l considered appropriate.

CAS Outcomes by PEAP Pillars

This section assesses country progress and Bank contribution toward the four PEAP pillars (for a
12.
summary see Annex Table 1: Uganda C A S Completion Report Summary Matrix). The focus i s o n the
CAS period (FYO1-03). However, because o f the delay in the preparation o f the U J A S and the fact that
there has been n o CAS Progress Report or any Interim Strategy, the analytic timeframe has been extended
to FY05.

More explanation on the Poverty Action Fund i s provided under the pillar 3 discussion below.

13.
Although, at the time o f the 2000 CAS the framework and terminology o f “Results Based CAS”
had not yet been developed, the CAS already vaguely resembled such a framework (compare Annex
Table C.10: C A S Program Matrix o f the 2000 CAS). The CAS not only identified the Government’s
development objectives under each o f the PEAP pillars, i t also included benchmark indicators, mentioned
measurement tools and identified the Bank instruments for each objective. However, some o f the
benchmark indicators were not defined clearly enough and their connection with the objectives and the
PEAP pillars sometimes seemed rather ad hoc. Furthermore, the measurement tools from the C A S matrix
(especially national household surveys) were not always conducive to the measurement o f the benchmark
indicators.
CAS Objective: SubstantiallyReduce Poverty in Uganda by 201 7
CAS Benchmarks
Reduce proportion o f Ugandans
below poverty line to 10% by 2017
Increase per capita consumption o f
poorest 20%

CAS Outcomes
Decrease in poverty f r o m 56% in 1992193 to 38% in 2002103 (no short-term
conclusions over CAS period possible, due t o inconsistency in household
data).
Increase in consumption measures o f welfare, i.e. diets and living conditions
o f poorest 20% between 1999100 and 2002103.

The C A S included Uganda’s overarching PEAP objective to substantially reduce poverty by
14.
2017. The C A S benchmark indicators under this objective were directly derived from the PEAP.
However, the first CAS benchmark was a long term development goal rather than an intermediate
outcome indicator and progress toward this benchmark needs to be seen in a longer term perspective
rather than within the narrow CAS implementation period. The second C A S benchmark under this
objective, however, was more specific.
The living standards o f Uganda’s poor substantially increased during the 1990s. Since 1992, the
15.
Government has been monitoring living standards through the Uganda National Household Surveys
(UNHS). These surveys indicate that the poverty headcount declined from 56 percent in 1992/93 to 34
percent in 2000. However, the latest household survey from 2002/03 indicates a rise in poverty headcount
to 3 8 percent in 2003.
The 2005 Uganda Poverty Assessment concludes that inconsistencies in the data between the two
16.
latest household surveys do not allow any conclusions regarding changes in household consumption or
poverty over the period 1999100-2002103. According to the assessment, when compared with data from
the previous 1999/00 U N H S , Uganda’s most recent survey data (2002103) shows very modest growth in
average consumption, a decline in average consumption in the lowest quintiles, and an increase in
inequality, resulting in an increase in the poverty headcount nationally and in all regions. However, closer
examination o f these results shows contradictions in the data which prevent reaching any conclusions
about the short term trend in poverty reduction. For example, the consumption measures o f welfare-i.e.
non-monetary measures o f consumption welfare, diets and living conditions-presented in the 2002/03
U N H S show a marked improvement in the recent period. A new household survey, n o w in the field, may
provide more insights on these issues.

17.
Since this particular C A S objective was considered t o be overarching, all Bank interventions in a
more or less direct way contributed to this objective. In addition, it i s important to note that in Uganda the
Bank i s only one o f many Development Partners, which are all together contributing to the Government’s
development goals. Every outcome (if positive or negative) under each pillar should be seen in the light o f
joint efforts - which have been fkrther enhanced with the new U J A S -‘to harmonize the various strategies
and should be jointly attributed to the Government and i t s Development Partners.

106

Pillar 1: Actions that Directly Increase the Ability of the Poor to Raise their Incomes

As the PEAP rightly diagnosed, poverty in Uganda i s predominantly a rural phenomenon: 85
18.
percent o f Ugandans live in rural areas, which include 96 percent o f the country’s poor. During the CAS
period, the Bank’s objectives under this pillar were therefore more or less directly focused o n outcomes
that contributed t o raising the incomes o f the rural population.
While the U N H S 2002103 did not include an explicit income module, however, more detailed
19.
insights into the outcomes achieved under this pillar can be gained by looking h o w consumption and
poverty vary according to the income generating activities o f household members (the C A S did not
include any indicators along these lines). While it i s unfortunately not possible to draw conclusions from
comparing the t w o latest household surveys, i t i s possible to note a long-term trend according to which
among Ugandans living in households headed by crop farmers, poverty decreased f r o m 64 percent in
1992193 to 50 percent in 2002103.

CAS Outcomes

Sustained agricultural sector growth o f 4% o r
more

Agricultural sector growth of4.2% average between FYOl and
FY05

Agricultural sector growth between FYOl and FY05 averaged 4.2 percent (above the C A S
20.
benchmark o f 4 percent), thanks to a substantive increase in agriculture sector growth above 5 percent
between FY04 and FY05. During the original CAS period (FYO1 t o FY03), agriculture growth averaged
3.6 percent only, mainly attributed to the impact o f prolonged dry weather conditions.
Because o f the importance o f agriculture for the livelihoods o f the poor, policy interventions to
2 1,
raise incomes o f the rural poor in Uganda are primarily outlined in the Government’s Plan for
Modernization o f Agriculture (PMA) launched in 2000. Seven priority intervention areas are highlighted
in the P M A : (i)
agricultural research, (ii)
agricultural advisory services, (iii)
agro-processing and
marketing, (iv) rural finance, (v) physical infrastructure, (vi) agricultural education, and (vii) natural
resource management. The CAS was aligned with the P M A . Directly related stand-alone projects focused
on agricultural research and agricultural advisory services only, but the PRSC program as well as related
projects (e.g. the various Road projects) included a broader contribution to the PMA. Thus, the Bank’s
contributions to the above outcomes must be seen within the PMA framework, which also includes other
Development Partners.45 In accordance with the PMA, the CAS recognized that central in achieving
outcomes under the first pillar was the promotion o f agricultural diversification and modernization o f the
rural sector, with commercialization o f smallholder farmers. The logic was that these interventions reduce
poverty among subsistence food-crop producers and decrease the economy’s vulnerability to exogenous
shocks.
The Agricultural Research and Training Project (ARTP 1) that closed in the f i r s t year o f the C A S
22.
period, contributed to the PMA by developing an organizational framework and institutional process for
agricultural research in Uganda, and successfully supported the National Agricultural Research
Organization (NARO). Thus the project succeeded in building a sound institutional basis for supporting
agricultural research, resolving the Africa Cassava Mosaic Disease and enabling recovery o f cassava
production, improving the understanding o f the importance o f interaction with farmers and other
stakeholders, establishing strong functional relationships between regional and international research
institutions, and transforming NARO from c i v i l service to semi-autonomous status. The C A S recognized
the importance o f further strengthening o f agricultural research and continued to support technology

Other donors engaged in the rural sector include USAID, EU, DANIDA, IFAD and the Netherlands.

107

development and dissemination, consistent with the PMA. The current ARTP 2, implemented in the
context of the restructuring o f the National Agricultural Research System (NARS), supports
modernization a n d enhancement o f the efficiency and effectiveness o f the Ugandan agricultural research
system and related agricultural higher education programs with the objective o f generating ecologically
sound a p c u l t u r a l technology and developing human capacity. At the same time i t seeks to make the
system more responsive t o farmer’s technological needs and priorities. Since effectiveness, the project has
contributed significantly to the N A R S reform. The project supported the dissemination and adoption o f
improved technologies generated under ARTP 1. Currently 85 percent o f NARO’s crop research outputs
are used by extension services and 30 percent o f livestock farmers adopt at least two n e w technologies. In
addition, the project so far resulted in the operationalisation o f seven (from only two at project start)
agricultural research and development centers, established zonal research teams and farmer research
groups, and formed linkages with other agricultural service providers, particularly NGOs and CSOs.
The C A S recognized that in order to assist farmers (including women farmers) to increase their
23.
productivity and incomes, sustainable extension and advisory services would be necessary. The C A S
learned from the shortcomings o f the Agricultural Extension Project (AEP; closed in FY99), which failed
to lead t o significant increases in efficiency or effectiveness o f the extension services, and therefore did
not have a positive impact on agricultural productivity. Lessons were included in the National Agriculture
Advisory Services (NAADS) Project, which became effective in F Y 0 2 and was developed to promulgate
a new approach to the delivery o f extension services. The key concepts and approaches that distinguish
N A A D S fi-om the AEP are: (1) a demand-driven advisory service, with the goal to empower poor
private sector-led advisory service delivery. Since project inception an
smallholder farmers, and (ii)
increasing amount o f farmers have been articulating demands and monitoring contracts tendered for
private service delivery. So far, according to a survey, this resulted in a 27 percent increase in
productivity in farm enterprises in N A A D S subcounties compared to non-NAADS subcounties. In
addition, 40 percent of farmers are n o w having access to improved a p c u l t u r a l technologies.
The PRSC reform program supports other priority areas o f the PMA through budget support. In
24.
addition to the N A A D S project, the PRSC supported the Government in expanding N A A D S (as of FY05)
to 280 sub-counties in 29 districts. A recent study by the International Food Policy Research Institute
(IFPRI) concluded that participation in the N A A D S program i s associated with significantly higher value
of crop production per acre. For example, the value o f crop production per acre in 2002/2003 was
predicted to be 15 percent higher for households that participated in the N A A D S program than those who
didn’t. The analysis did not find robust statistically significant impacts o f N A A D S or other extension
programs o n income per capita, however. These results indicate that were N A A D S i s operating it i s
having a significant impact, but has not yet reached a geographic coverage large enough to affect national
poverty indicators.

25,
The PRSC also provided supplemental support to N A R S reform, however, with slower progress
regarding the implementation o f N A R S legislation, which has not yet been enacted. Other support under
the PRSC aimed at improving agriculture performance to increase the ability o f the poor to raise their
incomes included reducing constraints to agro-processing and marketing and promoting access to land,
Progress in the former area include an increase in agriculture exports f r o m 14.1 percent o f GDP in 2000
to 23.4 percent in 2004, implementation o f the Strategy for Agricultural-Marketing and Agro-Processing
under the PMA, and-most recently-product standards and market information. A market information
system i s currently operating in six districts with progress o n establishing a Ugandan maize standard
aligned t o an East African regional standard which should facilitate regional maize trade. Regarding
access to land, the approval o f a Land Sector Strategic Plan (LSSP) under the PRSC does not seem to
have resulted yet in an increase in land holdings among the poorest household, due to Uganda’s high
population growth rate leading to fragmentation and subdivision o f property and due to loss o f land due t o
environmental degradation. In 2002/2003, less than 1 percent o f households possessed land titles for
agriculture production.

108

26.
The CAS also recognized the importance o f an increase in exports o f rural products other than
coffee to increase the income o f farmers. The Cotton Subsector Development Project (CSDP), which
ended during the C A S period and preceded the PMA, achieved a tripling o f cotton production, an efficient
processing and marketing system, an increase in the grade o f cotton produced (to premium) and a rise in
export earnings despite depressed prices and a serious drought in one year. According to the UN, in 1995,
the year o f the approval o f the project, Uganda ranked number 56 among top cotton exporters worldwide
compared with rank number 36 in 2002, the year the project closed. The number also show an increase in
the value o f cotton exports in Uganda from 8.8 million in 1995 to 12.6 million in 2002. According to the
Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the project, Bank support under the CSDP directly
influenced a decrease in rural poverty in the parts o f Uganda (mainly Eastern Uganda) where cotton i s a
large part o f farm income.
CAS Objective: Improve Natural Resource Management
CAS Outcomes
Continuing problems with soil erosion
Deforestation continues at 2% per year

CAS Benchmarks
Reduce soil erosion
Reduce deforestation

27.
While the C A S benchmarks under this objective were formulated as outcomes, they failed to
establish any measurable threshold for success. In addition, only very rough estimates concerning the
status o f these indicators exist. Increasing population pressure and resource extraction are s t i l l
contributing to growing environmental degradation, particularly soil erosion (suggesting that the C A S
benchmark was not met). Deforestation continues at around 2 percent per year (the C A S called for a
reduction in deforestation) and data for tracking the loss o f wildlife i s not available.
28.
The CAS recognized that poverty in rural areas i s often strongly linked to a heavy reliance o n the
environment and that Uganda’s rapid economic growth over the last years has put significant stress on i t s
natural resource base. A 200 1/2002 Participatory Poverty Assessment (PPA), exploring poverty trends in
12 districts o f Uganda for the period from 1990, also emphasized the importance o f access to natural
resources and the environment for the livelihoods o f the poor and their ability to raise incomes.
29.
The Bank’s strategy in this area was a strengthening o f the institutional capacity for
environmental resource management. The first Environmental Management and Capacity Building
(EMCB 1) project, which closed during FYO1, successfully established the Natural Environmental
Management Authority (NEMA) and built capacity for natural resource management at national, district,
and community levels. The main outcomes included the finalization and approval o f Environmental
Impact Assessment guidelines and regulations, preparation o f draft standards o n water quality, effluent
discharge, air quality and noise pollution, and the development o f several national environmental
education strategies. The ongoing second phase o f the project (EMCB 2), which was approved in FY02,
has so far succeeded in strengthening capacities in 26 districts and initiated a process for communities to
address natural resource degradation problems o f local concern. In addition, it trained district and subcountry facilitators, completed environmental action plans, and established environment district
information systems. As a result, about 10 percent o f districts are currently reflecting environmental
priorities in their District Development Plans.
30.
Further institutional strengthening o f NEMA i s also an objective under the PRSC program. The
current PRSC chiefly aims to (i)
finalize and beginning to implement a sector-wide investment plan; and
(ii)
ensure NEMA’Ssustainability by including i t s financing in the medium-term budget framework (at
the moment, the Government only funds about 10 percent o f the recurrent budget o f NEMA).

109

The Protected Areas Management and Sustainable Use Project, approved in FY03, already
3 1.
strengthened the institutional capacity o f the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) and helped to improve
the management o f human resources, and agency governance for sustainable and cost-effective
management o f Uganda’s wildlife and cultural resources. Today, UWA finances 63 percent o f i t s
recurrent costs through i t s own revenues, up from only 49 percent before the project started. The
successful handling o f an outbreak o f anthrax among hippos at Queen Elizabeth’s National Park in late
2004, demonstrated UWA’s increased capacity to handle unanticipated shocks and threats.
32.
The regional Lake Victoria Environment Project, spanning Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya, which
was approved in FY97, aims at (i)
providing the necessary information to improve management o f the
establishing mechanisms for cooperative management by the three countries and (iii)
lake ecosystem, (ii)
identifying and demonstrating practical, self-sustaining remedies, while simultaneously building capacity
for ecosystem management. The project’s aims are thus long term which, combined with some problems
in project implementation complicates the measurement o f intermediate outcomes. However, the project
did contribute to 80 percent reduction in water hyacinth coverage on Lake Victoria since 1997.
CAS Objective: Improve Rural Roads
CAS Benchmarks
District roads fully repaired and maintained
bv 2016

CAS Outcomes

67 percent o f district roads in fair condition in 2003 (from 15
Dercent in 1988)

33.
Another C A S objective under the first pillar was the improvement o f “rural roads”. The
government’s goal under the second PEAP was the full repair and maintenance o f district roads by 2016.
Even though this was a long-term goal rather than a short-term outcome, the C A S listed it as a benchmark
indicator under this objective. According to the third PEAP, the proportion o f district roads in fair
condition improved from 15 percent to 67 percent between 1988 and 2003 respectively (suggesting good
progress toward the C A S benchmark). However, only 10 percent o f community access roads were
reported to be in good condition in 2003.
The access to rural roads has a direct impact o n the ability o f poor people t o raise their incomes.
34.
The C A S recognized that rural roads open up rural areas to wider markets, access to production inputs
and create opportunities for competition, reduced transport costs, and innovation. Under the Transport
Rehabilitation Project (FY94-01) about 1,014 km o f rural feeder roads were maintained in the five project
districts. According to the I C R Review for the project, “[tlhe rehabilitation, improvement and
maintenance o f the road infrastructure resulted in a 30 percent reduction o f travel time and vehicle
operating costs”. The on-going rehabilitation and maintenance o f national main roads under the Road
Development Program (Roads 1 through 4) already resulted in improved accessibility t o productive rural
areas (see more below under pillar 3).
35.
The El N i n o Emergency Road Repair project, which closed in FY04, restored and rehabilitated
key roads and bridges severely damaged by heavy rains associated with the El Nino weather pattern in
1998. About 1,505 km o f unpaved road sections and 329 km o f paved roads have been repaired, and 6
new major bridges and 3 culverts have been built. In addition, the ecosystem near the affected roads has
been stabilized, resulting in a re-establishment o f drainage conditions to “pre-flooding levels”.
36.
In addition, under the Road Sector Institutional Support Teohnical Assistance Project a ten-year
district road and urban road investment program was developed as an upgrade to the 1996 road sector
development plan. Implementation i s ongoing under the PRSC program and included maintaining 9,000
km of district roads, rehabilitating 780 km o f district roads, and undertaking spot improvement o n 320 km

this sector contributed to better market access for the poor.

CAS Outcomes
Rural households access to electricity increased
f r o m 1% in FYOO to 3% in F Y 0 3
NIA

The first C A S benchmark under this objective was to increase the proportion o f rural areas with
37.
access to electricity. While the CAS failed to establish any clear threshold to measure success, this was a
highly relevant outcome indicator. Regarding the proportion o f rural areas with access to electricity there
seems to have been a modest advance. According to the U N H S 2002/2003, households in rural areas in
Uganda do not use electricity for cooking. However, the use o f electricity for lighting in rural areas
increased from 1 percent in 1999/2000 to 3 percent in 2002/2003 (meeting the CAS benchmark to
increase rural areas access to electricity). The C A S also mentioned a C A S benchmark o n adequate
absorption o f external shocks. The CAS probably referred to the continuing problem o f load shedding in
Uganda, however this i s not directly connected with the objective o f developing rural energy (general
power generation i s discussed under pillar 3).
The C A S recognized that access to electricity supply raises rural incomes by permitting the
38.
introduction o f new technologies and services. In addition, the CAS recognized that central t o achieving
this goal would be the creation o f an institutional framework for rural energy delivery and investments in
renewable energy. The Energy for Rural Transformation Project, approved in FY02, successfully
established a Rural Electrification Agency, which i s currently gaining experience in handling rural
electrification projects. Initial rural electrification and renewable energy investments are proceeding
satisfactorily. Currently, 14 M W o f renewable energy power generation facilities are under-construction,
19,000 cumulative Watt peak sales o f solar PV systems to households and institutions have been made,
and a solar home system price reduction o f 30 percent has been achieved since 2000.
39.
The third and fourth Power Projects together succeeded in expanding the hydroelectric plant at
Owen Falls, adding 200 MW o f additional generation capacity. M o r e outcomes under both projects are
mentioned under pillar 3.
CAS Objective: Increase Assets in Poorest Regions
C A S Benchmarks
Reduce regional disparities
in poverty (increase livelihood o f
people in east and north)

CAS Outcomes
Decrease in poverty in the north f r o m 72% in 1992193 t o 63% in 2002103;
decrease in poverty in the east f r o m 59% in 1992193 t o 46% in 2002103 (no
short-term conclusions over C A S period possible,, due t o inconsistency in
household data).

The CAS noted the large regional disparities in Uganda. The east and north posed particular
40.
problems with incomes significantly lower than the rest o f the country. The CAS’ objective was therefore
to increase assets in these poorest regions, with a benchmark calling to reduce regional disparities.
Unfortunately, due to inconsistency in the data as highlighted in the 2005 Poverty Assessment, it not
possible to draw short-term conclusions about poverty in eastern and northern Uganda over the C A S
period. Poverty decreases in the north from 72 percent in 1992/93 to 63‘percent in 2002/03 and in the east

f r o m 59 percent in 1992193 to 46 percent in 2002103. Both numbers, however, remain higher than the
national average o f 38 percent in 200212003.

4 1.
However, it i s interesting to note that the CAS objective actually called for an increase in assets.
According to the last U N H S , while income poverty increased, ownership o f assets actually increased and
the quality o f housing improved. The proportion o f households even in the lowest quintile owning bikes
and radios and other consumer durables increased. Non-income welfare measures also improved. Because
o f these and other contradictions in the U N H S data, the 2005 World Bank Poverty Assessment does not
draw conclusions about the short-term trend in poverty in Uganda between the two latest household
surveys.
42.
The CAS recognized the need to reduce regional disparities. Especially the north, which accounts
for 22 percent o f the population and has the highest population growth rate o f 4.6 percent per year, was
acknowledged to require special attention for poverty reduction in Uganda. Prolonged conflict and
traditional under-development o f the north have put severe strains on communities and has reduced their
ability to cope with the problems they are confronted with. The CAS recognized that community based
development should be at the core o f the strategy for the north.
The Northern Uganda Social Action Fund (NUSAF), a part o f the broad multi-donor Second
43.
Northern Uganda Reconstruction Program (NURP 2), empowers communities in northern Uganda (18
districts located in the north and east) by enhancing their capacity to systematically identify, prioritize,
and plan for their needs, and implement sustainable development initiatives that improve socio-economic
services and opportunities. N U S A F was approved toward the end o f the C A S period and remaining
hostilities require a lot o f flexibility with the implementation o f the project. Currently, 45,000 households
are utilizing sub-project facilities, over 9,000 vulnerable persons are receiving assistance, and 5 1
communities are benefiting from reconciliation efforts.
Pillar 2: Actions that Directly Increase the Quality o f the Life o f the Poor

44.
The PEAP diagnosed lack o f access to basic services, such as health care, primary education, and
clean water and sanitation as the main factors affecting the quality o f the l i f e o f the poor. During the C A S
period, the Bank’s focus was to support activities that would improve the delivery o f these basic services.

CAS Objective: Improve Health Care Services
CAS Benchmarks
Immunization ratios o f children (DPT3) increase t o
80% by FY03
Increase percentage o f health centers with trained
staff to 65% by FY03

CAS Outcomes
Increase o f immunization ratios from 35% at CAS
design t o 83% in FY03
Increase o f approved posts filled by formally
trained health workers from40% to 68% between
FYOl and FY05

45.
The CAS showed significant progress in reaching explicit C A S benchmark indicators: the
immunization ratios o f children improved from about 35 percent o f children immunized (DPT3) at the
time o f the design o f the CAS, to 84 percent in FY03 (the benchmark indicator was 80 percent by FY03).
The share o f posts in government and private not-for-profit health units filled by qualified health workers
rose from about 40 percent in FYO1 to 68 percent in FY03 (thus reaching the benchmark indicator o f 65
percent). Another helpful indicator (not explicitly mentioned in the CAS) i s a large increase in the
utilization o f outpatient health care services from 0.43 visits per person per year in FYOl t o 0.72 visits per
person per year in FY03.
W h i l e the CAS benchmarks can be seen to contribute to outcomes towards the C A S objective, the
46.
C A S did not establish any objective (or benchmarks) to prove that the improvements in services actually

112

increased the quality of the life o f the poor. Looking at more direct health indicators (and MDG targets),
Uganda’s health status over the CAS period was mixed. The country has experienced a significant decline
in i t s H I V / A I D S adult prevalence rate over the last decade (from about 18 percent in the early 1990s to
6.1 percent in 2001), and there has been no significant increase in HIV prevalence in FYO1-03, which was
at 6.1 percent in 2000/2001 and 6.2 percent in 2002/2003. T h i s apparent stagnation in reduction o f
H I V / A I D S prevalence should be considered against the backdrop o f extremely high population growth
rates (around 3.4 percent) during the CAS period. According t o the latest Demographic and Health
Survey (DHS) in 2000, infant and child (under-5) mortality was 88 and 152 per 1,000 l i v e births
respectively. Maternal mortality was 505 per 10,000 in 2000. The next D H S i s expected in late 2005,
therefore there has been n o measure o f progress in mortality rates during the C A S period. Uganda’s total
fertility rate remains extremely high at 6.9 percent.
47.
The objective o f Uganda’s National Health Policy (NHP) i s to improve health through reducing
morbidity and mortality from major causes o f illness. In support o f this objective, the NHP calls for
provision o f a cost-effective health care package. The N H P was operationalized through the Health Sector
further
Spategic Plan, 2000/01-2004/05 (HSSP). Major reforms under the HSSP consist of: (i)
redistribution o f the health budget in favor
decentralization o f service delivery to health sub-districts, (ii)
o f primary healthcare, and (iii)
strengthening o f collaboration with the private sector. The C A S was
closely aligned with the HSSP during the CAS period. Under the sector-wide approach (SWAP) adopted
for the sector, much o f the donor funding for the sector i s channeled through the budget rather than as
separate projects. The Bank, together with the Government and other Development Partners, participate in
a Health Policy Advisory Committee and joint review missions, which have become central forums for
stakeholder consultation and monitoring implementation o f the HSSP.47
48.

The District Health Project (DHP) and the Sexually Transmitted Infections Project (STI) were

two projects that closed during the FYO1-03 CAS. Together, they contributed toward rebuilding Uganda’s
health care system, which was in a state o f near collapse in the late 1980s. The DHP provided broad
programmatic support to the Government’s reform agenda including decentralization, capacity building in

health planning, and management o f district health services. A total o f 56 districts benefited from capacity
building assistance under the project, headquarters o f the Ministry o f Health were reconshucted and, in
addition to the HSSP, the Ministry formulated a new Health and Nutrition and Food Policy.

The STI project was the largest contributor to Uganda’s national H I V / A I D S program in the
49.
1990s. I t achieved substantial training and capacity-building o f central and district officials and NGOs,
increased inclusion o f civil society, made condoms more widely available, and increased the capacity to
implement HIV/AJDS programs at the district level. A June 2005 OED Project Performance Assessment
Report o f the S T I rated the outcome o f the project moderately unsatisfactory o n the basis that it showed
shortcomings in the prevention o f sexual transmission o f HIV and the mitigation o f the personal impact o f
AIDS, but significantly strengthened the capacity o f districts to undertake strategic planning and
management o f activities supporting the fight against H I V / A I D S and t o manage resources. S T I was
followed by the on-going Uganda H I V / A I D S Control Project, which expands IDA support in fighting
H I V / A I D S across sectors and across levels. The project supports the goals o f the Government’s National

mitigate the
Strategic Framework for H I V / A I D S that aims to: (i)
health and socio-economic impact o f H I V / A I D S at individual, household and community levels, and (iii)
strengthen the national capacity to respond to the epidemic. The project so far contributed to a reduction
in HIV prevalence among women o f childbearing age (as measured in women attending prenatal care
services) from 8.5 percent in 2001 t o 7 percent in 2005. In addition, 30 percent o f secondary schools

today incorporate H l V / A I D S in their curriculum (from 0 percent in 1999) and 54 percent o f hospitals are
providing prevention o f mother to child transmission services (from 6 percent in 2001).
Since completion o f the DHP in 2002, the PRSC program directs support to the implementation
50.
o f the HSSP. The SWAP adopted for the sector enhanced national ownership and leadership by the
Government. I t resulted in considerable reduction in transaction costs and improved predictability o f
resource flows. Funding for the health sector increased on average by about 9 percent annually over the
C A S period, with most o f that funding coming through the budget. The proportion o f the health budget
allocated to districts increased from 32 percent to 49 percent during the CAS period, and it continues to
increase. Under the PRSC program, the Government abolished user fees in public health facilities. The
abolition o f user fees, along with an increased availability o f essential drugs and basic medical supplies in
the health centers, has had a direct impact o n the r i s e in outpatient attendance as mentioned above. In
addition, the Bank over the CAS period has been able to build a stronger partnership with the Government
and other Development Partners, improve efficiency in development management, and increase
effectiveness in supporting the HSSP. The program support has reduced parallel reporting systems and
helped the Government to focus o n building local capacity for service delivery management, including
the capacity o f private-not-for-profit agencies and other c i v i l service and community-based organizations.
The C A S also recognized that central to achieving a better health status (even though this was not
5 1.
an explicit C A S objective, see previous discussion) was the implementation o f policy interventions
targeted at the most vulnerable segments o f the population. Thus the recently closed N u t i t i o n and Early
Childhood Development Project (NECDP), which was approved in FY98, aimed at improving the health,
nutritional and cognitive status o f preschool children in Uganda by providing community-based child
development services and enhancement o f women’s ability to care for children. A synthesis o f various
evaluation reports under the project concluded that between the end o f F Y 0 2 and FY03, the proportion o f
children in 34 project districts who were underweight (as defined by two standard deviations below the
norm) amongst the 0-36 months old declined from 24.4 percent t o 17.1 percent respectively and f r o m
16.8 percent to 14.3 percent for the 37-72 months old. Stunting declined from 40.1 percent t o 36.2 percent
between FY02-FY03. However, while the favorable trend in malnutrition reduction i s encouraging it
cannot be solely attributed to the project activities, due to an absence o f data from control households in
matched districts where the project was not implemented.
CAS Objective: Improve Quality of Primary Education
CAS Benchmarks
Pupil-teacher-ratio from 65: 1 in FYOO to 47: 1 by FY03
Pupil-classroom-ratio from 106: 1 in FYOO to 87: 1 by FY03
Pupil-textbook ratio from 6: 1 in FYOO of 3: 1 by FY03

CAS Outcomes
Pupil-teacher-ratio of 54: 1 by FY03
Pupil-classroom-ratio o f 94: 1 by FY04
Pupil-textbook-ratio o f 2: 1 by FY04

52.
The CAS benchmark indicators under this objective were largely “proxy” outcome indicators,
measuring the quality o f primary education in absence o f more direct indicators (e.g. pupils’ test-scoring)
and directly aligned with PRSC indicators (see below). The Government i s committed t o achieving the
MDG on Universal Primary Education (UPE) by 2015, and eliminating gender disparity in primary and
secondary education by 2005. Between 1999/2000 and 2002/03, primary net enrollment rates for the
poorest 20 percent o f Ugandan households increased from a total average o f 82.5 percent to 84.5 percent.
The increase has been especially strong among girls. Overall female net primary enrollment for the lowest
quintile increased from 69.1 percent to 76.6 percent. The increase was equally strong in rural as well as in
urban areas, with an increase in female primary enrollment f r o m 67.8 percent to 75.0 percent in rural
areas and from 79.8 percent to 84.2 percent in urban areas over the same period. According to the
200 1/2002 PPA, education i s s t i l l highly valued by communities as a means o f rising out o f poverty.
However, despite good improvements in CAS benchmark indicators, the actual quality o f education
remains a concern. Currently the repetition rate in primary education i s about 13. In addition, survival rate

114

to grade 7 i s only 22 percent and while gender balance i s being maintained at the primary level i t i s s t i l l
unequal at the secondary level with only a 45 percent share o f girls.

53.
The Bank’s CAS shared the Government’s objective to attain UPE and envisaged to ensure that
by 2015 every b o y and girl completes primary education o f good quality. The C A S supported Uganda in
developing an education system that i s holistic, meeting learning needs from basic literacy to advanced
skills, emphasizes education and learning outcomes, and i s sustainable, efficiently managed and
adequately financed. The CAS recognized that such an education system would be essential for a
productive and competitive economy, thus enhancing Uganda’s competitiveness in global knowledge
driven markets.

54.
Coming t o closure in FYO1, the Education Sector Adjustment Operation satisfactorily improved
the allocation o f resources for primary education. During the project period, total expenditure on primary
education increased from 56 percent to 69 percent o f total education budget. In addition, the efficiency in
teacher employment was increased, and education sector management improved. The Primary Education
and Teacher Development Project, which closed during the first year o f the CAS, succeeded in building
or rehabilitating 18 primary teachers colleges, 298 coordinating centers, and 2,782 classrooms. The same
project also allowed training o f thousands o f teachers in professional development courses.
Since then, the Bank has supported the education sector through PRSCs. Under PRSC 1, the
55.
Government launched a national recruitment drive for teachers, resulting in marked improvements in the
recruitment o f primary school teachers by some districts. In addition, in-service training has been
provided and efforts have been undertaken to attract primary school teachers to poor remote areas. The
pupil-teacher ratio improved nation-wide from 65: 1 in FYOO to 54: 1 in FY03 (the C A S benchmark was
47: 1). Another measure started under PRSC 1 was the issuance o f new procurement arrangements for
instructional materials. These new arrangements resulted in an improvement in the quality o f learning
materials, while reducing the unit cost by over two-thirds. As a result, the pupil-textbook ratio improved
from 6: 1 in FYOO to 2: 1 in FY04 (better than the 3.1 ratio envisaged by the CAS). During the C A S
period, the Government undertook an evaluation o f a 1999 classroom construction program, which made
recommendations to increase efficiency in classroom construction. The PRSC program supported the
implementation o f these recommendations under a national plan for expansion o f school facilities. The
pupil-classroom ratio improved from 106: 1 in FYOO to 94: 1 by FY04 (the C A S benchmark was 87: 1).

56.

Jointly with the Government and other Development Partners, the Bank carried out a series o f
studies on post-primary education focusing o n teacher utilization, coverage, equity, and efficiency, unit
cost analysis, school quality, firm demand, management, and options for expansion. The results o f these
are currently contributing to the development o f a strategy for post-primary education.

Comments
Indicators evolved during CAS period
into measuring access to safe water in
the PRSCs:
People with access to safe water in
ruralhrban areas from 50%/54% in
FYOO to 57%/67% in FY04.

57.
As in education, the C A S benchmark indicators under this objective measured outputs aligned
with PRSC indicators (see below) rather than actual outcome indicators, e.g. the access to safe water. The
Bank Team recognized this during the implementation period and the indicator evolved into measuring
the access to safe water in the PRSC program (in line with the MDG targets). The overall goal o f the
Government o f Uganda i s to provide every Ugandan with access t o safe water and sanitation o n a

115

sustainable basis by the year 2015. Uganda i s poised to exceed the MDG target to halve the proportion o f
people without sustainable access to safe drinking water. During the C A S period, people with access to
safe water in rural areas increased from 50 percent in FYOO to 57 percent in FY04; and from 54 percent in
FYOO to 67 percent in F Y 0 4 in urban areas. Since Uganda started from a l o w baseline o f about 20 percent
of people with access to safe water in 1991, meeting the MDG target in this area seems not that difficult.
However, as in other areas, the Government’s targets for improvements in water and sanitation are more
ambitious than the MDGS. The second PEAP aimed to achieve 65 percent safe water and sanitation
coverage for the rural areas and 80 percent for the urban areas by 2005. The third PEAP aims at 90
percent (80 percent with respect to sanitation) in rural and 100 percent in urban areas by 2008.
58.
The C A S aimed to improve access to sustainable, cost-effective and safe water supply and
sanitation facilities through decentralized communal water resources. The Small Towns Water project
from 1994, which closed during the CAS period, provided 11 small towns and Jinjamjeru with improved
sustainable water supply and sanitation. Since then water and sanitation i s covered through the PRSC, the
N i l e Basin Initiative, and water and sanitation reforms through the PSD project (see below).
The C A S recognized the need to increase the physical infrastructure for water and sanitation
59.
supply and supported the government’s efforts through the PRSC. By early 2005 over 3,700 water points
were delivered to rural areas, extending the safe water coverage to 900,000 rural people. By 2002, about
1,118 boreholes had been drilled and 346 had been rehabilitated (the C A S benchmark was 1,500
boreholes). Over 1,500 protected springs (CAS benchmark was 700), and 2,200 protected wells (CAS
benchmark was 1,700) were also added to the stock o f rural water sources. While there i s clear progress in
the delivery o f safe water, progress in the areas o f sanitation provision and hygiene mitigation, which i s
much harder to measure, i s less obvious. Lack o f progress in this area has an important negative effect
o n the achievement o f PEAP and MDG targets and goals, e.g. in the area o f child, infant and maternal
mortality (see above).
Pillar 3: Creating an Enabling Environment for Economic Growth and Structural Transformation

The PEAP under this pillar covered economic growth, specifically the creation o f environment
60.
conducive to economic growth and private sector development. Therefore, the Bank’s support under this
pillar focused o n increased private sector competitiveness, privatization, infrastructure (power and roads)
and financial sector development. In addition, the CAS under this pillar focused o n macroeconomic
stability and the poverty focus o f public expenditure.
CAS Objective: Sustaining High Rate of Economic Growth
CAS Benchmarks
7% real G D P growth

CAS Outcomes
Average GDP growth o f 5.5% in FY01-04

During the 1990s Uganda achieved an extraordinary growth record, with growth rates averaging
61.
6.7 percent between 1986 to 1999. The PEAP aimed at sustaining these high growth rates and the C A S
aligned itself with the same goal. W h i l e growth was s t i l l commendable and above the average GDP
growth rate for Sub-Saharan Afkica (3.8 percent), over the C A S period (2000-2004), growth averaged 5.5
percent, which i s below the C A S benchmark. As already mentioned, the deterioration in the growth rate
was mainly attributed to external factors: the impact o f prolonged dry weather conditions o n the overall
performance o f agricultural output, lower growth in food crops and higher fuel prices. In addition,
structural changes have occurred in the economy over the last decade and a half, which have affected the
overall pattern o f growth. For example, while agriculture was the engine o f growth a decade ago, i t s
contribution to GDP has since fallen considerably, and i s n o w almost at per with the services sector. The
share o f agriculture in Uganda’s economy was about 46 percent between 1992-1999, compared with 38

116

percent between 2000-2004. The share o f services grew from 38 percent to 45 percent over the same time
frames.

InUganda, the key programs to support economic growth during the C A S period included the
62.
PMA, the Strategic Exports Program (SEP), and the Medium Term Competitiveness Strategy (MTCS). In
i t s overall strategy and reform agenda to promote economic growth, the Government has placed emphasis
o n increasing the role o f the private sector as an engine o f growth. While the PMA concentrates o n the
promotion o f agricultural diversification and modernization o f the rural sector (see above), the SEP
concentrates o n further interventions to catalyze growth in certain strategic export areas, in order t o
exploit comparative advantage and diversify exports to lessen the economy’s vulnerability to exogenous
shocks. In addition, the key conclusion o f the M T C S i s that while growth can only be delivered by the
private sector, government has to create an enabling environment.
Thus in order to promote economic growth, the CAS supported activities that focused on
63,
removing the constraints to private sector competitiveness. The first Private Sector Competitiveness
improving the business environment, (ii)
Project, which closed in FY03, contributed to this goal by: (i)
enhancing know-how through markets, (iii)
enhancing know-how through financial partners, and (iv)
enhancing know-how through industrial partners. According to an impact assessment carried out in 2001,
Bank support under this project directly increased the sales o f all beneficiary firms o f up to 90 percent.
About 80 percent o f the beneficiaries registered a significant improvement in their market knowledge, and
about 57,760 n e w jobs were registered with the Ugandan Investment Authority over the project period. In
addition, the project successfully established a private/public sector dialogue lead by the Private Sector
Foundation Uganda. InFY05, the Board approved phase two o f the project which aims t o create
sustainable conditions for enterprise creation and growth that responds to local and export markets.
The on-going Privatization and Utility Reform Project concentrates o n improving the quality,
64.
coverage and economic efficiency o f commercial and utility services, through privatization, private
participation in infrastructure, and an improved regulatory framework. So far, the project succeeded in the
privatization o f 22 public enterprises and the establishment and capacity strengthening o f 2 regulatory
agencies (telecom and electricity). In addition, the project contributed to a reduction o f subsidies to public
enterprises by 80 percent (from U S $ 147. 3 m i l l i o n in 2001 t o US$41.3 m i l l i o n in 2005) and an improved
quality and coverage o f services in telecom, water, and e l e ~ t r i c i t y . ~ ’

higher among exporter firms, with 64.3 percent, than non-exporters, with 41.7 percent?’

InUganda, the Bank’s Public Expenditure Review (PER) as a core diagnostic has had significant
66.
contributions to achieving the C A S objective o f macroeconomic stability through bringing about changes
in budget performance and monitoring, and contributing to the dialogue o n spending priorities t o achieve
PEAP objectives. An Analytic and Advisory Assistance Assessment (AAA) by the Quality Assurance
Group (QAG) in early 2005 (covering FYO1-04) highlighted that during the C A S period, the PER process
occupied a central role in the Government’s efforts to improve public expenditure and fiscal management.
In addition, the PER had a pivotal role in donor harmonization, and in improving the integration o f the
key sectors (especially health and education). Although the drafting o f the PER i s done by the Bank, the
PER process i s very participatory involving the Government, development partners and various other
stakeholders. All stakeholders gather in annual PER workshops to review MTEF allocation priorities and
debate budget execution. PER workshops are strongly consensus-building and establish a clear system
for donor consultation. The PER was also strongly linked with the Bank’s fiduciary core diagnostics, e.g.
the Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) and the Country Procurement Assessment
Report (CPAR), and for the f i r s t time in FY04 an attempt was made to involve other development
partners in drafting (in addition to their extensive involvement in the process). The result, a Country
Integrated Fiduciary Assessment (CIFA) coordinated and consolidated the PER with three other usually
separate Bank diagnostic processes: the CPAR, the CFAA, and the Local Government Integrated
Fiduciary Assessment (LGIFA).

Even though the CAS stated them separately, a closer look at both o f these objectives and their

outcomes suggests that together they covered aspects o f the efficiency o f public expenditure management.
M o r e specifically the generation o f revenue and the extent to which public expenditure was aimed to
reduce poverty. This i s in contrast t o the institutional effectiveness o f public expenditure, which was a
different objective.
68.
Government expenditure increased rapidly since FY97, averaging 24.4 percent o f GDP over the
C A S period. The rapid growth o f government expenditure i s partly due to high growth in expenditure in
public administration. Domestic revenues increased over the C A S period from 10.9 percent o f GDP in
FYOl to 12.3 percent o f GDP in F Y 0 2 and 12.6 percent in FY03 (thus meeting the C A S benchmark,
which called for an increase in the revenue-to-GDP ratio). Most recently, however, revenue has been
decreasing slightly and was estimated at 11.9 percent for FY05. The poverty focus o f government
expenditure increased over the C A S period, as the Poverty Action Fund (PAF) share o f expenditure
increased from 32.3 percent in FYOl to 37.1 percent by FY03 (the C A S benchmark was an increase o f

PAF share o f total expenditure to at least 25% by FY03).50 But Uganda's fiscal deficit has widened
steadily from 6.3 percent o f GDP in FY98, peaking at 13 percent in F Y 0 2 and 11.4 percent o f GDP in
FY03. The maintenance o f high government expenditure but l o w domestic revenue has mainly been
possible due to external borrowing and grants to finance economic and social development programs.
T o increase domestic revenue, the government has been strengthening tax administration in

particular the management o f the Uganda Revenue Authority (URA). URA has taken significant steps in
this direction by producing an annual business plan, which lays out h o w the various departments intend t o
meet the objectives o f the five-year corporate strategy to strengthen tax administration. Inaddition to
measures around the PER as mentioned above, other Bank efforts concentrated o n improved fiduciary
measures for public expenditure management. In FYO1, the government, jointly with the Bank and other
donors, conducted a C F A A and a CPAR, which concluded that inadequate resource allocation, resource
management and control, resource utilization and accountability processes and systems both at the center
and in districts pose a major fiduciary risk. T h e major recommendations reflected in the CPAR were
incorporated into the PRSC program. Both core diagnostics have been updated in the F Y 0 4 CIFA.
Another major analytic study at the beginning o f the CAS, the H I P C tracking assessment from fall 2001,
and the HIPC tracking update in 2002, pointed out a number o f weaknesses at the local government level.
The reform program was expanded t o address these weaknesses under PRSC 2 and PRSC 3.

70.
The Bank's Second Economic and Financial Management Project (EFMP 2) and the Local
Government Development Project (LGDP) are together aiming at mitigating fiduciary r i s k in public
expenditure management both for taxpayers and donors, achieve economy, efficiency and effectiveness in
the use o f public funds, and enhance transparency and accountability (see below). Major outcomes during
the CAS period include: the enactment o f the new Public Finance and Accountability A c t (PFAA) in
2003, the establishment o f a Public Expenditure Management Committee (PEMCOM), and, as an effort
to increase accounting capacity, the increase in the number o f accounting professionals in government
from one person in 1999 to a total o f 52 people in FY03. In addition, strengthening o f the Office o f the
Auditor General allowed for improved auditing o f local governments accounts. About 40 percent o f
districts and urban authorities submitted annual accounts for 200 1/2002 within the statutory deadline.
Concerning the poverty focus o f government expenditure, the C A S recognized the importance o f
71.
public expenditure management and the Bank contributed significantly to the efficient and equitable use
o f public resources during the C A S period through annual PERs as mentioned above. The PRSCs have
been strongly linked the PER/MTEF process. PRSC as the main modality for funneling aid (and the
largest single source of transfer to the national budget) successfully increased budget predictability,
enhanced accountability, and improved the impact o f public expenditures. PRSCs thus directly
contributed to the notable increase in PAF expenditures. The PRSC process facilitated the effective
protection o f PAF expenditures from other budgetary pressures.
50 The Poverty Action Fund was introduced in 1998199 as an approach to protecting poverty relevant expenditures,
I t identifies those areas of spending within the budget which are particularly important for poverty reduction. The
PAF has been extended since its inception in 1998199, and n o w includes all o f the major poverty-sensitive
expenditures identified within the PEAP. For example, it includes primary education, the delivery o f an essential
package o f primary and preventive health services, clean water and sanitation, rural feeder roads, some agricultural
services, and expenditures o n monitoring and evaluation o f poverty programs. For an intervention to qualify as a
PAF program it must meet all o f the following four criteria: (i)
it i s inthe PEAF'; (ii)
it i s directly poverty reducing
(raising incomes or improving the quality o f the life o f the poor); (ii)
it i s delivering a service to the poor (it
addresses the needs o f the poorest 20%, and i s accessible to them recognizing barriers, e.g. cost); (iv) there i s a well
developed plan for the program (a costed strategy with clear monitorable targets).

CAS Objective: Improved Infrastructure (Power and M a i n Roads)
CAS Benchmarks
Separate UEB into entities responsible for
generation, transmission, and distribution and
provide for private participants at each stage
Investment in n e w power generation capacity
Increase funding for road maintenance (increase

CAS Outcomes
UEB separated into entities responsible for
generation, transmission, and distribution.

About 2,000 km o f m a i n road maintained o r
upgraded since FY94. About 880 km o f national
roads and 1,000 km o f district roads in the process
o f umrading.

The CAS objective under this pillar focused on improved infrastructure. However, the CAS
72.
benchmarks for energy concentrated on output rather than outcome indicators. For example, rather than
focusing on the increase in investment in power, the CAS should have concentrated o n actual electricity
generation, just like the relevant project indicators did (see below). According to the 2002/03 Investment
Climate Assessment, Ugandan firms perceive infrastructure constraints as another major threat to
competitiveness. Electricity poses the greatest constraint, with 44.5 percent o f Ugandan f i r m s saying that
they recognize electricity constraints as major or very severe (in 2002/2003Ugandan f i r m s experienced an
average o f up to 38.6 power outages). The same f i r m s emphasized efficient transportation as the second
greatest constraint. A total o f 22.9 percent o f f m s surveyed said transportation poses a major or very
severe constraint to competitiveness.
As already mentioned above, the CAS, in accordance with the MTCS, supported the creation o f
73.
an enabling environment for the private sector and focused on removing the constraints to private sector
competitiveness. In addition to the support provided under the Private Sector Competitiveness Project and
the Privatization and Utility Reform Project, the CAS noted the high constraints to private sector
competitiveness stemming from inadequate infrastructure, such as unreliable power and roads.
During the CAS period the Uganda Electricity Board (UEB) was separated into three separate
74.
entities: the existing power generation capacity, power transmission and electricity distribution (as
benchmarked in the CAS). The third Power Project (Power 3), which closed during FYOl and i t s
successor Power 4, succeeded in expanding the hydroelectric plant at Owen Falls, adding 200 MW o f
additional generation capacity (meeting the CAS benchmark o f investment in new power generation
capacity). In2002,25,000 new consumers were connected to grid electricity. In addition, Power 4 i s
providing capacity building to the Electricity Regulatory Authority and assisting the Government to
implement a new downstream petroleum supply regulatory framework.

75.
The Energy for Rural Transformation (ERT) Project, aims to facilitate rural transformation (see
above). Further improvements in electricity supply during the CAS period should have been provided by
the Bujagali Hydropower Project, which was expected to establish a private sector company to construct
own and manage a 200 MW hydropower facility and about 100 km o f transmission lines. In December
2001, the Bank’s Board approved a US$ 115 million partial r i s k guarantee for the project (the CAS
planned US$ 100 million). A private sponsor was to provide US$ 115 million in equity. Allegations o f
corruption led to a U.S. Department o f Justice investigation, which - together with deteriorations in the
private sponsor’s finances - resulted in a collapse o f the private financing arrangement. The project
sponsor pulled out o f the project in August 2003. The government has since issued a request for proposals
for new sponsors.
Since 1999 the Bank has supported Uganda’s 10-year District and Urban Road Investment
76.
Program. In 1999 the four-phase Road Development Program was launched as a part o f specific project

120

support t o the sector, with additional funding channeled through the PRSCs. The f i r s t phase (Roads 1) i s
in the process o f upgrading about 275 km o f national roads to paved (bitumen) standard, Roads 2 i s
upgrading and strengthening two national roads spanning about 270 km, Roads 3 i s about to upgrade and
rehabilitate 340 km o f national roads, and Roads 4 will rehabilitate 1,000 km o f district roads. The
program i s expected to result in a reduction in average travel time o n main roads, and in transport and
vehicle operation costs. Efforts are underway for an economic reevaluation o f Roads 1 to confirm this
outcome. Under the Transport Rehabilitation Project (FY94-Ol), about 1,746 km o f main roads were
maintained, 170 km regravelled, 66 km resealed, 27 km strengthened, and 66 km o f main road were
upgraded from gravel bitumen standards.
77.
The Road Sector Institutional Support Technical Assistance Project succeeded in laying the
institutional groundwork for the improvement o f the national road network and established the Road
Agency Formation Unit (RAFU) in 1998. The project primarily focuses improving the efficiency and
operational capacity o f RAFU. In addition, a Road Agency Study carried out under the project included
recommendations o n h o w to re-structure the responsible ministry t o deal with policy and regulatory
functions only.
On the non-lending side, the Transport Sector Investment and Recurrent Expenditure Program
78.
(TSIREP), a rolling three-year estimate o f sector expenditure which mirrors the MTEF and which
prioritizes PAF and national road maintenance expenditures, provided an important background for
donors support during the CAS period. The government’s performance o n TSIREP i s a major explanatory
factor behind the strong Bank and donor support for the road sector. Maintaining that performance will be
a significant challenge for the upcoming UJAS period.
CAS Objective: Improved Environment for Private Sector
CAS Benchmarks
Sustained supervision o f commercial banks

Increase financial sector competition
(privatize UCBL)
Efficient handling o f commercial justice

CAS Outcomes
Successful write o f f o f large outstanding loans by
leading commercial bank
UCBL sold t o major international bank

N/A (covered under development partner programs)

79.
Although this CAS objective mentioned the private sector, a closer l o o k at the C A S benchmarks
suggests that the CAS under this objective really covered financial sector reform. The link that the C A S
made between financial sector reform and an improved environment for the private sector might not seem
immediately obvious. However, according to the 2002/2003 Investment Climate Assessment, 60 percent
o f Ugandan f i r m s perceive the cost o f financing as major or very severe constraint. Only 32 percent o f
f i r m s use some form o f bank credit compared to 80 percent o f Kenyan firms. When f i r m s do obtain
external financing it i s often short-term, and nearly 40 percent o f f i r m s which do have a loan have a
maturity o f one year or less, reflecting a risk-averse banking system. Inaddition, the C A S included a
benchmark for commercial justice (which, however, in Uganda i s mostly covered through programs from
other development partners e.g. Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden) as a contribution towards
building an enabling environment for the private sector. However, the C A S benchmarks under this
objective were rather vague and again in the form o f outputs rather than measurable outcomes. However,
they were largely aligned with progress measured under Bank projects (see below).
The CAS did not include cost o f doing business indicators under this C A S objective. However,
80.
the Presidential Investors Round Table identified the high cost business environment as a k e y obstacle to
private investments. InUganda, starting a business requires more procedures than in any other SubSaharan African country except for Chad. Opening a business in Uganda i s also time-consuming. F o r
example, in 2003 and 2005 it took 36 days o n average to start a business in Uganda, almost 50 percent

121

more than in OECD countries (27 days less, however, than the Sub-Saharan Africa average). Uganda
retains an exceptionally high cost o f 118 percent gross national income per capita for opening a business
(135 percent in 2003), almost three times the cost for f i r m s in India and Kenya (Uganda, however,
remains well below the Sub-Saharan Africa average o f 215 percent). On a more positive side, the
minimum o f capital required to start a business in Uganda i s zero.
Envisaged under the 1997 C A S and approved in FY99, the Financial Markets Assistance Project,
81.
among other things, aimed at restructuring and privatizing the Uganda Commercial Bank Limited
(UCBL). The UCBL component, which was a CAS benchmark indicator, however, proved too
contentious and the credit was not approved by the Ugandan Parliament. Nevertheless, the Bank o f
Uganda proceeded with the privatization under i t s own statutory powers and UCBL was sold to a major
international bank in 2002. Another C A S benchmarks pointed towards the need for sustained supervision
of commercial banks. Sustained supervision i s hardly an objective measure. However, progress in this
area can be indicated by the successful write o f f o f large outstanding loans by a leading commercial bank
in 2003. In 2001/2002, a joint IMF-World Bank Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) provided
the Government and the Bank o f Uganda with several recommendations regarding prudential regulation
and supervision o f the banking sector, non-bank financial institutions, microfinance and several legal
issues. In 2003, an IMF-led Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) that was based o n the FSAP
concluded that: “. . .the banking system in Uganda, which dominates the financial system, i s
fundamentally sound, more resilient than in the past and currently poses n o threat to macroeconomic
stability”.
82.
However, further issues in capital markets, pensions, and trade finance need t o be addressed t o
ensure depth and outreach in financial services in Uganda. Under PRSC 2, a new Financial Institutions
Bill and Microfinance Deposit-taking Institutions A c t have been enacted and implementation has started.
Together they provide for improved regulation and supervision o f the banking system and microfinance
institutions (MFI). The Bank’s main input to microfinance during the C A S period has been through nonlending assistance, with the development o f a new regulatory fiamework for MFIs. One-time support for
capacity building o f rural MFIs has been provided through the Cotton Sector Development Project (see
above).
Pillar 4: Good Governance and Security

CAS Objective: Effective Decentralization
CAS Benchmarks
Number o f Districts eligible for District
Development Grants under LGDP.

CAS Outcomes

5 1% o f Local Governments meeting assessment minimum
conditions for accessing L G D P fimds

The CAS under this pillar called for effective decentralization as a prerequisite for good
83.
governance. CAS benchmark indicators were directly aligned with the key Bank support programs for
decentralization (see below). However, the CAS failed t o indicate any threshold that would indicate
whether or not the C A S objective had been achieved.
84.
The CAS supported decentralization f i o m the center t o the district councils by strengthening the
capacity of the local governments to deliver sustainable basic services t o their residents, During the C A S
period, the first Local Government Development Program (LGDP 1, approved in FYOO and closed in
FY04), and the second Local Government Development Program (LGDP 2, approved in FY04) directly
contributed to effective decentralization. At the end o f the implementation period for LGDP 1,5 1 percent
o f local governments met the minimum conditions for accessing LGDP funds. In the absence o f any clear
threshold, one can only assume that this progress was sufficient to meet the C A S benchmark (LGDP 1
actually called for 90 percent o f local governments to meet the assessment minimum conditions until

122

FY03. However, after project effectiveness new districts were included, including districts in northern
conflict areas).

85.
The failure to establish sensible CAS benchmark indicators under this objective, however, i s in
contrast to substantive contributions o f the Bank toward effective decentralization. LGDP i s testing the
feasibility o f implementing constitutional and legal mandates with respect to decentralized service
provision, assists in building the capacity o f the Ministry o f Local Government, and tests and institutes
alternative service delivery mechanisms through the private sector. So far the decentralization process has
introduced service delivery at local government level to 56 districts and over 900 local governments.
Currently, each district has 35 council members, and each sub-county about 25, resulting in some 24,460
officials that have been voted into office, most o f who, however, have little or n o experience in
government operations. In addition, there are 94,000 parish and village officials that f o r m the
administrative structure and rely on local councils for guidance.
The Bank also recognized that the rapid decentralization process created the need o f effective
86.
education and training. The Makerere University Training Pilot supports Uganda’s efforts at improving
the quality o f decentralized public services delivery, primarily through equipping Makerere University,
and other institutions o f higher learning, t o provide relevant skills and competencies, and supporting
capacity building interventions on a pilot scale in local governments. During the C A S period, the project
resulted in enhanced academic institutional capacity with an internship pilot that placed some 1,300
students from several faculties with local governments across Uganda and the development o f 9
internship programs in relevant disciplines. In addition, a decentralization course, aimed at developing a
common understanding o f core concepts, and challenges o f decentralization, has been piloted.

CAS Objective: Transparent, Efficient and Poverty Focused Public Expenditure
CAS Benchmarks
Implement reform programs for procurement and
improved financial accountability.
Develop and implement sustainable pay reform
program.
Reduce perception o f corruption.

CAS Outcomes
N e w Public Procurement Law; legal and regulatory
framework for public procurement established.
Public sector pay reform passed and gradually implemented.

23% o f Ugandans perceived corruption as a serious problem

87.
The CAS objective was formulated too broadly and the poverty focus o f public expenditure was
redundant, since it was already discussed as a separate C A S objective under pillar 3.51 Therefore, the
CAS benchmarks under this objective suggest that the focus o f attention under this pillar was the
transparency and efficiency o f the public sector (two dimensions, which ultimately o f course have an
important impact on h o w well public expenditures reach the poor). T w o o f the C A S benchmarks were
formulated in terms o f outputs rather than outcomes and directly aligned with activities under Bank
projects and subsequent support under the PRSC program (see below).
A C A S benchmark was a reduction in the perception o f corruption; however, n o threshold for
88.
success in this area was established, and the experience over this period was mixed. Any progress of
governance (including corruption) over the C A S period i s provided by the Governance Indicators as
compiled by the World Bank Institute.52 Between 2000 and 2004, out o f six o f W B I ’ s Governance
Indicators Uganda improved it’s standing in two (voice and accountability, and control o f corruption),
5 1 There was also no benchmark indicator to measure the poverty focus o f public expenditure (e.g. the P A F share o f
the budget).
52 The WBI governance indicators reflect the statistical compilation o f responses on the quality o f governance given
b y various sources. The aggregate indicators in no way reflect the official position o f the World Bank, its Executive
Directors, or the countries they represent.

123

with essentially n o change in two (political stability and regulatory quality) and deterioration in two
(government effectiveness and rule o f law). However, none o f these changes over time are statistically
significant. In 2004 Uganda outperformed other Sub-Saharan countries o n average regarding both
government effectiveness and regulatory quality, and it also fared much better than other countries in the
same income category (in 2004, government effectiveness in Uganda was ranked at 38.5 percent versus
27.6 percent as the average for countries in the same income category; and regulatory quality was rated
53
54.7 percent versus 29.5 percent, respectively).

The CAS highlighted the need o f public sector reforms in order to improve its efficiency and
89.
capacity. Improvements in public financial management through LGDP and EFMP 2 have already been
covered above under pillar 3. As part o f Uganda’s fiscal adjustment program during the late 1980s and
early 1990s, the government with Bank support successfully implemented various measures to increase
the efficiency o f the public sectors. The number o f ministries over that period was reduced from 3 8 to 2 1
in 1994 and central government staff was reduced from 320,000 to 148,000 by 1994. The C A S was
designed t o assist the Government’s 1997 Public Service Reform Program (PSRP), which, however,
during the C A S period flagged and lost support. Notwithstanding that one o f the objectives was to
rationalize structures, public sector workforce steadily crept up and reached 204,000 people in 2002.
The Institutional Capacity BuildingProject (ICBP), which closed during the second year o f the
90.
C A S period, succeeded in building central government capacity. A major success was to consolidate
Government agencies (from 21 to 17) before improving capacity at these agencies. In addition, improved
criteria and procedures were adopted for hiring staff and international accounting standards were
introduced. A total o f 7,013 public, private and NGO staff received training through 290 courses in
various relevant areas.
91.
After closing o f the ICBP, the dialogue o n key policy issues relating to public sector reform has
been conducted via the PRSC program. During the C A S period, a new Public Procurement L a w has been
enacted, and the legal and regulatory framework for public procurement has been established (the C A S
benchmark called for the implementation o f reform programs for procurement and improved financial
accountability). There are several indications that there has been substantial progress beyond this C A S
benchmark. For example, procurement units have been set up in all central government procuring
ministries, departments and agencies. At the end o f PRSC3, the effective implementation o f the Public
Procurement L a w s t i l l lacked adequate staffing and budget, a shortcoming, however, that i s being taken
o n under subsequent PRSCs. In addition, the Government started gradual implementation o f a public
sector pay reform (the CAS called for the development and implementation o f a sustainable pay reform
program). However, despite reaching the CAS benchmarks under this objective, public sector reform
progress was highly uneven during the C A S period. In addition t o the increase in the size o f public sector
workforce, there have been difficulties in controlling budget expenditures o n public administration
despite the progress in pay reform. Despite efforts t o contain expenditures o n public administration, these
expenditures reached 17.6 percent o f total government expenditures in 2002/2003.
92.
Despite the mixed picture in this area, Uganda has made progress, particularly with respect to the
key institutions and processes to tackle corruption. Under the PRSC program the Government proceeded
with the implementation o f a new Leadership Code after i t s assent into l a w in July 2002. Given the wide
coverage o f the new code (about 16,000 people) and limited capacity o f the Inspector General o f
Government (IGG), the Government decided to proceed with the enforcement o f the code in phases,
paying most attention to key groups o f leaders (ministers, presidential advisors, permanent secretaries,
directors, and URA officials) in each phase. Despite technical difficulties and capacity constraints, the
Government has had some success with the enforcement o f the code: by September 2005, all o f the 64
ministerial level declarations o f assets had been verified (a PRSC5 prior action.) Even with this progress,
53

Percentile ranks indicate the percentage o f countries worldwide that rate below the selected country.

124

conuption remains a concern. According to the latest National Integrity Survey in 2003,23 percent o f
Ugandans perceive conuption as a serious problem. According to the ICA 2002/03, 38.2 percent o f f i r m s
in Uganda perceive conuption as a major or very severe constraint. Among these f i r m s particularly
exporters perceive corruption as a high constraint, with 56.4 percent o f Ugandan exporters saying that
corruption poses a major or very severe constraint to their operations compared to 35 percent o f nonexporter s.
While this pillar also included security, the CAS did not contain an explicit objective o n security.
93.
However, actions contributing toward increased security in Uganda were (at least implicitly) covered
under the C A S objective o f increasing assets in poorest regions, including the conflict ridden north.
Relevant actions therefore included interventions under the Northern Uganda Social Action Fund (see
above, pillar 1). However, the high degree o f insecurity in the north remained during the C A S period.
Over 1 m i l l i o n people are internally displaced and living in camps within the region. Humanitarian
agencies estimate that between 10,000 and 16,000 children have been abducted and forced t o become
combatants. Loss o f income from abandonment o f crops alone i s estimated at approximately US$213
million, representing the second highest factor after military expenditure contributing towards the total
$1.3 billion cost o f the war (which corresponds to 3 percent o f GDP).

C.

Measuring Bank Performance

The key indicators from the Bank’s Operations Evaluation Department (OED) in the period
94.
FYO1-05 for closed lending operations to Uganda were generally favorable, with an average o f 85 percent
rated satisfactory on outcomes, slightly above the average o f all W o r l d Bank projects with 83 percent and
well above the Africa Region (AFR) with 77 percent. The Uganda country program compares mixed with
the AFR and Bank-wide o n other key indicators: o f projects that closed during FYO 1-05, an average o f 55
percent were rated with substantial impact on institutions, compared with only 43 percent for AFR and 52
percent for the Bank. This picture, however, looks different in relation to the total value o f operations
with only 32 percent of Uganda’s portfolio rated with substantial impact o n institutions compared with 4 1
percent for AFR and 57 percent Bank wide. The Uganda portfolio received almost the same ratings than
the AFR average regarding the likelihood o f sustainability, with 70 percent for Uganda versus 69 percent
for the AFR average. The Bank wide average rating for this indicator with 83 percent, however, i s above
the country and the regional average.

Portfolio performance during the formal C A S period (FYO1-03) was satisfactory, with
commitments at risk falling from 13.1 percent o f the total in FYOl to only 2.1 percent (with 100 percent
realism) in FY03. Performance, however, has deteriorated during the past two fiscal years due mainly to
lack o f timely counterpart funds, problems in procurement and financial management. During FY04,29.4
percent o f commitments were at r i s k and realism stood at 66.7 percent. The situation improved slightly

125

during FY05, with 28.2 percent o f commitments at risk and realism at 71.4 percent. However, the
proactivity index for the portfolio at 100 percent i s well above the Africa target o f 80 percent and the
current A f h c a average o f 77 percent. The analytical work programs have largely been delivered and
additional E S W added as appropriate (see Annex Table 3 o n planned non-lending program and actual
deliveries).
The Bank’s country team has intensified supervision o f projects, and has agreed o n specific
96.
actions with the government, including extending, restructuring, or seeking additional financing t o
address issues affecting portfolio performance. The upcoming results-based Country Portfolio
Performance review (CPPR) will focus on development outcomes. In addition to suggesting concrete
steps for improving portfolio performance, the CPPR will aim at improving the alignment o f the country
program to the goals and outcomes o f the 2004 PEAP. The CPPR will build o n the findings o f a
monitoring and evaluation assessment o f the portfolio to ensure that the project and program outcomes
are captured.
The policy dialogue with the Government o f Uganda and the Bank’s operations has been based
97.
o n a broad-based program o f analytic work. The strategy therefore sought to build o n a series o f reviews
and assessments that informed stakeholders o f progress in poverty reduction, the quality and adequacy o f
public services, governance, the debt situation, and private sector development as w e l l as flagging
concerns and suggesting the way forward in some cases. The Country AAA Assessment by QAG in early
2005 rated the Uganda AAA program over the C A S period Satisfactory. The Strategic Relevance and
Coherence and Integration dimension were rated Highly Satisfactory, and all other dimensions are rated
Satisfactory. I t notes that the CAS has been instrumental in pulling together previously uncoordinated
analytical pieces and consolidating the knowledge base. There has been much more planning during the
C A S period, with a l o t more just-in-time analytical work having been conducted.
98.
M u c h o f the AAA work was designed t o support the shift to PRSC, while drawing o n the large
stock o f analytical work previously conducted. As presented in Annex Table 3, the actual AAA program
was dominated by core diagnostic E S W (PER, CFAA, CPAR, CIFA) and by sector w o r k in health and
education. AAA o n the private sector and broader growth agenda was less o f a focus, but studies o n
agricultural modernization, land reform, the financial sector, and the investment climate were ultimately
carried out. Private sector and growth-related AAA picked up in FY04 as the focus shifted towards the
“growth agenda”, with work o n the investment climate and export competitiveness. Non-lending technical
assistance was provided on privatization and rural electrification

99.
A Client Survey for Uganda carried out in 2003 concluded that fi-om an overall perspective,
stakeholders regarded the Bank’s work as relevant, and the Bank has cultivated strong relationships.
According to the survey, the Bank was most valued by stakeholders for i t s financial resources, followed
by policy advice and knowledge. For the most part, the Bank’s sector work was viewed favorably, in
particular the work it was doing in many areas that stakeholders identifed as important, such as
infrastructure development and strengthening the educational sector. However, two areas where clients
helping t o reduce poverty and (ii)
helping
saw shortcomings concerning the Bank’s involvement are: (i)
to reduce external debt.

Lessons and Issues for the Next CAS

Overall Lessons

100.
A positive portfolio performance needs to also b e translated into results. A striking
conclusion from comparing OED measures o f project performance with the outcomes achieved over the
CAS period (section B), which also seems to be emphasized in the client survey i s that, while the Bank in
Uganda received positive performance ratings over the C A S period, the results o n the ground have been

126

mixed. An important lesson in this regard i s that, while perfonnance o f individual projects within their
operational framework might be satisfactory, overall Bank performance and impact might s t i l l be
insufficient. Unlike past CPPRs, the above mentioned ongoing Country Portfolio Performance Review
(CPPR) for FY06 will put special emphasis o n results on the ground. Inparticular, the CPPR will try to
find out h o w the Bank can best contribute to outcomes and how i t can best leverage the ongoing portfolio
toward achieving better results.

101. A key lesson for the next Country Assistance Strategy i s to ensure that a robust monitoring
and evaluation (M&E) framework i s in place and that it i s aligned with the country’s M&E system.
The n e w Uganda Joint Assistance Strategy (UJAS) will support a National Integrated Monitoring and
Evaluation System (NIMES) to monitor PEAP outcomes as spelled out in the PEAP results and policy
matrix. UJAS Partners will align their programs with this framework.
Lessons by Pillar

102. Progress under the first pillar has been slow and the Bank’s contribution toward raising
incomes o f the poor has to become more effective, focusing on interventions inside and outside of
agriculture. The worsening poverty numbers over the C A S period and the increase in regional disparities
suggest that progress has not translated into welfare improvements for the poor and a more equal
distribution o f incomes. On the one hand, the analysis o f the U N H S 2002/2003 shows that the CAS, with
i t s concentration o n the development in rural areas despite a decrease o f people working in crop farming,
provided the right focus for reaching the country’s poor and increasing their incomes. On the other hand,
the new UJAS will have to pay more detailed attention to specific and concrete actions that should be
taken t o address prevailing income inequalities and poverty. A key challenge will be h o w to get a more
even (and accelerated) implementation o f the Program for the Modernization o f Agriculture (PMA)
within the Bank’s and other development partners’ instrument choices. This includes further
strengthening o f the linkage between agricultural research and advisory services. In addition, it will have
to include greater alignment o f all Bank activities to PMA objectives, which are multi-sectoral. The recent
increase in poverty numbers among households headed by crop farmers also points to the broader
challenges outside specific agricultural interventions, i.e. the development in commodity markets and
other distortions, which have an influence over competition and hence an impact o n rural household
income.
103. Progress under the second pillar has been good, but after focusing on improving access to
basic services, the new UJAS should concentrate on the quality o f the services provided. The C A S
achieved significant progress in some benchmark indicators for the health sector, most notably a rise in
immunization rates, an increase in outpatient attendance and hiring o f qualified health care workers. The
overall health status o f the population, however, did not improve significantly as can be seen f r o m
remaining high infant and child mortality rates, in addition to high fertility rates. The new U J A S will have
to step up i t s efforts to turn recent improvements in health service delivery into outcomes that improve the
health status o f the poor. In education, the achievements over the C A S period have been overall positive
as reflected in meeting quantitative targets and improvements in pupil-teacher, pupil-textbooks, and pupilclassroom ratios. Remaining high drop out and repetition rates, however, raise doubts about the actual
quality o f education. The new UJAS will have to take care that quantitative targets are also followed by
qualitative improvements. The Government seems to be well o n track for reaching its targets for safe
water coverage and the Bank’s input over the C A S period has contributed significantly t o this goal.
104. Progress under the third pillar has been mixed and the key challenge for the Bank over the
UJAS period will be how to improve and sustain growth over the coming UJAS period, for Uganda
to reach its poverty reduction targets. The lower growth numbers point to the need o f a clearer vision
of the structural transformations necessary t o underpin sustained higher growth. The relative decline in
the importance o f agriculture suggests that agriculture interventions will have to become more selective

127

and responsive to market forces to increase competitiveness. While the C A S paid sufficient attention to
the creation o f an enabling environment for private sector engagement, it did not concentrate enough o n
the drivers for economic growth, such as exports. Core reforms that have been achieved (e.g. the reform
of the financial sector, the privatization and reform o f key utilities) need to be both maintained and
developed further if Uganda i s to transform itself into a competitive economy. At the same time,
additional policies and approaches which enhance the transformation process and provide rapid private
sector growth, have t o be developed. The new UJAS will have to intensify efforts t o overcome
impediments t o private sector activity by strengthening governance, improving infrastructure, and hrther
supporting the development o f financial markets.

105. Despite some progress under the fourth pillar, the process of implementing governance
reforms during the CAS period was too slow and the new UJAS will have to further step-up efforts
in that area. The perception o f corruption i s s t i l l high. The new U J A S should be careful about recent
signs o f reversal in public sector reforms, where previously rationalized structures are experiencing an
increase in their workforce. A full implementation o f the next phase o f public sector reforms i s necessary
to reverse recent negative trends. One way forward could be to implement the approach o f consolidating
government agencies as adopted under the I C B project also at the local government level to ensure a lean,
professional, sustainable and affordable local government administration. In spite o f the on-going conflict
in northern Uganda, the Bank needs to support government and Development Partners in addressing
issues arising from conflict in an integrated way, especially the humanitarian aspects. The new PEAP
includes governance and security as independent pillars. T h i s will provide an opportunity t o develop a
comprehensive plan, integrating the regions affected by conflict into the rest o f the country.
