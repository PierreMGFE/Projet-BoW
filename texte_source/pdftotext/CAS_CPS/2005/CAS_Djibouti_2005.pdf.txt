EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.
During the late 1980s and most of the 1990s, domestic and regional military strife led
to deep macroeconomic imbalances and weakened economic activity in Djibouti. A prolonged
civil war disrupted vital economic sectors and imposed a heavy cost o n the budget. War in
neighboring countries led to a large influx o f refugees, putting an extra burden o n already

stretched public services. Fiscal mismanagement and waning donor support compounded the
impact o f these shocks leading to a build-up o f Government arrears o f some 30 percent o f GDP
by 2000. The Currency Board Arrangement limited the possibility o f the use o f monetary
instruments in macroeconomic management. GDP growth averaged less than one percent during
this period, compared with an average population growth rate o f 2.8 percent per annum further
deepening poverty.

..

During the past four years-the period of the last CAS-good progress was made in
addressing many of these problems. Supported by an IDA Fiscal Consolidation Credit (FCC),
and an IMF Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF), fiscal and structural reform
measures succeeded in halting the deteriorating macroeconomic situation and reversing the build
up of domestic arrears. These measures included civil service downsizing, a far-reaching
pension reform that placed the system on a much stronger footing, improved management o f the
port and airport facilities by entrusting i t to a private intemational investor, and strengthening o f
11.

public expenditure institutions.

iii.

However, this improved macro economic stability, while critical, is not sufficient to
deal with the deep structural problems of poverty and income distribution and take the county
out of the trap of low social and economic equilibrium. Despite its high per capita income
(US$920 in 2004) that places it in the ranks o f l o w middle-income countries, Djibouti has an
extremely high incidence of poverty (42 percent absolute and 75 percent relative poverty rates),
and a very low level o f human development as indicated, among others, by one o f the lowest
school enrollment and highest mortality rates in the world. At the same time, high wage rates in
the formal sector create serious problems o f non-competitiveness and skewed income
distribution. All these factors have contributed to l o w growth and employment creation and
would, in the future, continue to limit the possibility for Djiboutians to benefit from employment
opportunities that would be generated from the envisaged extension o f the port and the

development o f an associated free trade zone.

Djibouti’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), presented to the Board on June
S, 2004, identifies an ambitious four-pronged strategv. The strategy aims at: (i)
strengthening
competitiveness for higher and sustainable growth by persevering with overall macroeconomic
stability, while accelerating structural reforms to create a better investment climate for private
investment; (ii)
accelerating human development through improved school enrollment and
quality o f education, strengthening the health care system, broadening the social safety net; and
implementing the national gender strategy; (iii)
promoting regional and local development to
reach out to poor urban neighborhoods, nomads, and isolated rural communities; and (iv)
improving governance and public sector management through greater transparency and
iv.

accountability.

v.
The planned CAS for the period FY06-OS is broadly aligned with the main pillars of
the PRSP, building on the achievements of the previous CAS, which has also focused on the
same areas. Solid performance has been achieved under the previous CAS, marking a clear
departure from the past: all programs were, or are expected to be, completed o n or ahead o f time;

11

portfolio performance improved dramatically meeting all portfolio performance targets; and
every project i s expected to meet i t s developmental objectives. The planned IDA program would
support the pillars o f PRSP through lending and non-lending services. The competitiveness
pillar will be supported through: (i)
a power and water sector project to lower utilities’ cost and
extend service delivery to the poor, and (ii)
a partial r i s k guarantee to the concession o f the rail
link to Ethiopia in support o f the port to complement the previous road corridor project. Support
to the human development pillar will consist o f (i)
a second education project (APL), following
a skills development and employment creation project, and (iii)
on a first successful project; (ii)
an emergency floods rehabilitation project. Support to the governance pillar focuses on providing
assistance through IDF grants to the implementation o f the action program and recommendations
of the Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) and Country Procurement
Assessment Review (CPAR).
vi.
This CAS argues for a more active incomdrent distribution policy (more so than the
PRSP) as a critical policy reform area to reduce poverty, because Djibouti’s skewed income

distribution impedes the trickle down of the benefits of growth to the poor, and because, in the
case of a rent-based economy like Djibouti, it will continue to act as a major constraint to
growth itsew Djibouti i s essentially a rent-based economy, with rents deriving from i t s
geographical and geopolitical position contributing a much larger share o f GDP than agriculture
and industry. At present, most o f the rent (revenues from the port, rent o f military bases, and
grants and assistance), essentially channeled through the budget, i s captured by the civil service
in the form o f high public wages (the average public wage i s 9-10 times GDP per capita). This
deprives the majority o f the population from benefiting from public services, such as education

and health, because the excessive size o f the public wage bill (50 percent o f the budget) leaves
no room for improving service delivery beyond i t s very l o w level. In addition to crowding out
social expenditures and investment in human capital, the oversized wage bill crowds out
investment in physical infrastructure that fbrther drives up the cost o f doing business. The fixed
exchange rate policy emanating from the Currency Board Arrangements, keeps real wages high
as it shelters it from any adjustment through general price increase. Taken together, these factors
impede growth and employment and, in turn, hurt the poor.

vii.
With rents associated with the port and the militay bases, and foreign aid expected to
continue to be the major drivers of Government revenues and GDP, the only policy option
available to the Government in the short run to improve poverty and income distribution i s to
find ways to reduce public sector wage expenditures and redistribute these towards social and
infrastructure expenditures. This can be achieved through the combination o f an adjustment in
the exchange rate, an explicit reduction in wages, and a restructuring o f the size and composition
of the civil service. The CAS proposes to intensify the policy dialogue with the authorities to
delineate the most appropriate and feasible reform policy venue to address wage level
misalignment. I t reserves financial support to this reform under a high-case scenario which
would be triggered by the Government’s willingness to undertake this reform.

viii.
The planned assistance strategy entails risks. Sustained macroeconomic stability
depends heavily on the steady flow o f Government revenues from the port and military bases
rental, and more critically, on the implementation o f an adjustment o f the wage bill and exchange
rate to address Djibouti’s skewed income distribution and competitiveness problems. The first i s
linked to unpredictable development in the regional security situation, and the second on the
political will o f the authorities to move ahead with reforms. While the new foreign direct
investment in the port extension and the renewed rental o f military bases may mitigate the first

...

111

risk, the difficult political economy o f implementing an exchange rate and wage bill adjustment
sheds uncertainty around an effective way out o f the l o w equilibrium situation. Risks related to
the implementation capacity also exist, but experience from the last CAS shows that wellfocused projects with simple design and close and proactive supervision from the Sana’a Office
will help minimize significantly this risk.

Thefollowing issues are suggestedfor Board consideration:

Alignment o f the CAS program to the PRSP and focus o f the CAS program given the limited
IDA envelope.
Emphasis on income distribution and appropriateness o f the CAS proposed policy
instruments to address it.

I.COUNTRYCONTEXT
A. GENERAL
CONTEXT
Djibouti is a small and poorly endowed country with a service-based economy. I t has
1.1
an estimated population o f 660,000, two-thirds o f whom live in the capital city Djibouti-Ville.
Most o f the remaining population lives in a h a n d h l o f secondary towns. The natural rate o f
population growth is estimated at 2.4 percent per annum. Djibouti i s poorly endowed in natural
resources (limited arable land, rainfall and underground water). However, the country benefits
mainly from its strategic military and intemational shipping location o n the Red Sea’s southern

entrance.

Intemational since 2001) as well as related
business, I t also relies on the rental o f military
bases to France since independence in 1977, and
most recently to the us and Germany, including
services associated to these bases. External

grants
and other financing facilities i s also an
important source. This i s reflected in the large
share of the service sector in the economy,

Box 1: Historical Background
France established the port of Djibouti in 1892 as a
coaling station for ships traveling to its possessionsin the
Indian Ocean and Far East. Four years later, Djibouti
became a French territory. In 1977, after 80 years of
colonial rule, Djibouti gained independence from France.
At the time of independence, an agreement between
France and Djibouti provided for a French military
presence and development assistance, including sizable
budgetary support.

With a per capita income of US$920, Djibouti is classified as a low middle-income
country. Yet, it has a very high level of poverty (42% absolute and 75% relative) and some of
the poorest social indicators in the world. This paradox is explained essentially by the fact that
while a large part o f the economy i s based o n rents (derived from the port, military bases rental
and donors financial support), and channeled mainly through the budget, a significant part o f this
rent i s passed on to Government employees through high wages, leaving insufficient resources

contribution o f the primary and secondary sectors in the process o f production, Government
expenditure policy i s the primary instrument available for achieving income re-distribution in the
short- to medium-term. Achieving a better income distribution must be at the heart o f the

1.3

Government’s poverty reduction strategy, given the prevailing degree o f poverty and l o w level o f
human capital development in Djibouti. This implies a need for difficult policy actions if the
Government wishes to pursue a pro-poor agenda. The issue i s discussed further in Section 111.
B. POLITICAL AND INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS CONTEXT

1.4
A key determinant of Djibouti’s domestic political context and developments i s the
power balance interplay between its ethnicities. Djibouti’s population i s composed mainly o f
two ethnic groups, the Afars and the Issas. The Issas extend into Somalia and the Afars also
extend into Ethiopia and Eritrea. Competition for power among these ethnic groups led to a very

2

damaging civil war in 1991-94. This civil war triggered huge disruptions and macroeconomic
instability from which the country has yet to fully recover. The strong ethnic linkage o f Djibouti
to its volatile and conflict-prone neighbors-Somalia,
Ethiopia and Eritrea, i s a source o f
vulnerability and risk, e.g., leading to refugees flows, deterring foreign investment, and affecting
overall internal political stability. The pressure o n the country’s leadership and decision-making
process not to upset the precarious balance between these interests, under the current volatile
regional circumstances, diminishes i t s ability to take critical economic and social reform
decisions, precisely when they are most needed.
1.5
Djibouti’s political system remains, however, relatively open, with an elected president,
a Parliament and a judiciary. The executive reflects a sharing o f power between the two major
ethnic groups with higher representation o f the Issas in the Government, civil service, and the
ruling party. This power sharing i s subject to sporadic resentments (and challenges) by the
Afars. Widely acclaimed reforms toward a more meritocracy-based access to c i v i l service and
public sector jobs were undertaken by the current President. The next presidential elections are
scheduled for April 2005. The opposition has limited influence and representation in Parliament
as a result o f the winner-take-all electoral system. The President’s dominant coalition party,
Union pour la majorite‘pre‘sidentielle, i s expected to remain in power for the foreseeable future.
Djibouti’s international relations and partnerships strengthened in the last 3 years and
1.6
are expected to deepen during the CAS period. In addition to Djibouti’s strong historical
partnership with France, relations with the United States deepened following the increased U.S.
military presence in the region and the establishment o f a U.S. military base in Djibouti. Both
have resulted in improved external flows in the form o f rent (for bases) and aid. However, this
also creates the r i s k o f taking the pressure o f f the much-needed reforms, a possibility that the
Government and the donors should guard against.
Commercial relations with Ethiopia (currently capturing more than 60 percent of the
1.7
Djibouti’s port traffic) have become easier. This followed the signature in April 2003 o f an
agreement with Ethiopia governing the use o f the port and the transit o f goods to and from
Ethiopia. This lowers the risk o f Ethiopia traffic going to other ports.

1.8
Djibouti’s trade system is fully open with no protective targfs and non-tariff barriers.
Capital movement i s free, which has yielded a very high level o f openness. As such, Djibouti
has been a regional center for trade and financial services and could build h r t h e r on this and o n
i t s prospective port development to further strengthen its position.
Djibouti has recently adopted anti-money laundering legislation but it lacks
1.9
implementation capacig. Djibouti has not undergone a Financial Sector Assessment Program or
Anti-Money Laundering (AML) assessment. Djibouti’s fully open trading system and free
capital movement make the development o f an effective AML system a necessity to prevent
potential abuse that might undermine the country’s openness.

C. SOCIAL CONTEXT
1.10 Djibouti’s social indicators rank 157th among 174 countries on the UNDP’s Human
Development Index. Despite recent progress in expanding access, Djibouti’s education system
is s t i l l not on track to meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Illiteracy i s extremely
high, especially for women (85 percent). About 50 percent of children still do not attend

3
school, and more than 20 percent of those enrolled do not complete the six years of primary
education. There are also large inequalities in access to education services: enrollment varies
widely across income levels, gender, and regions. Moreover, the system i s very costly due to the
high unit costs for school construction and teacher salaries. Unfortunately, despite the enormous
needs, the budget does not have much room for additional expenditures since education
expenditure already accounts for close to 27 percent o f Djibouti’s large budget size o f 30 percent
o f GDP. These constraints render the achievements o f the MDGs nearly impossible (see Table
1, o n cost o f achieving education goals).

1.11 The health situation is also very difficult. L i f e expectancy, as an overall health
indicator, i s estimated at 49 years, one o f the shortest in the world. Infant mortality i s at 103 per
1,000. The immunization rate is only 45 percent, and malnutrition is a serious problem, with
indications that 14 percent o f children under the age o f five suffer from acute malnutrition, and
3 1 percent from chronic malnutrition. Diarrheic illnesses and acute respiratory infections are the
most common causes o f infant mortality. Maternal mortality rate i s high at about 7 per 1,000
live births and for extremely poor women this rate i s as high as 9 percent.
1.12

Wide gender gap and Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) are major social
developmental challenges. Women represent a very vulnerable segment o f the population. The
disadvantaged status of women i s reflected in the gender gap indicators in all social areas as

indicated above. High female mortality rates can be attributed to high fertility rates, anemia
caused by malnutrition, which are in turn exacerbated by the widespread practice o f female
circumcision. Ninety-five percent o f young girls between 6 and 9 years o f age have undergone
FGM. Infibulations, the most severe and harmful form o f FGM, are the most widely practiced.
They are known to cause serious lifelong negative physical and psychological impacts. This also
increases their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS infection.
A law prohibiting the practice of FGM was adopted in 1995, but has proved difJicult to
enforce because of the private nature of the procedure. The National Strategy for the
Integration o f Women in Development (SNIFD), adopted by the new Ministry o f Women Affairs
in 2002, includes the fight against this practice as one o f i t s pillars. There have also been several
recently organized workshops and awareness campaigns involving religious leaders, local and
intemational NGOs, UN agencies, and Government officials to help stop the practice.

1.13

1.14 The Qat Problem is not adequately addressed. Considerable time and resources are
devoted to chewing qat, an amphetamine-based stimulant grown mainly in Ethiopia and Yemen.
Most adult males in Djibouti chew Qat at all-male social gatherings for up to 5-6 hours a day,
taking time from work and family life, diverting the limited incomes o f poor people from basic
needs spending, and adversely affecting their labor productivity and struggle for improving their
well being. While precise figures are not available, it is estimated that Qat absorbs up to 30
percent o f family budgets. Even the poorest families spend a considerable share o f their budget
on Qat. Official import figures show that about 4,000 tons o f Qat, valued at DF3.00 billion ($12
million), were imported yearly, making it the highest value o f all import items. Long-term use o f
Qat has been shown in other countries to be associated with mouth cancer and other health
problems, including child malnutrition and mortality. While the issue was debated during the
PRSP preparation process, it was ultimately not reflected in the actual PRSP. Unfortunately,
there seems to be neither the consensus nor the commitment from the leadership to recognize and
deal with this issue.

4

11.

POVERTY AND INCOME DISTRIBUTION-THEPARADOX OF HIGHINCOME PER
CAPITA AND HIGHAND INCREASING POVERTY

2.1
Recent data’ show that poverty in Djibouti is both extremely high and on the rise. In
2002, about three-fourths (74.4 percent) o f the population lived under relative poverty line and
42.2 percent under extreme poverty, as compared to 64.9 percent and 34.5 percent, respectively,
in 1996. Surveys show that the most dramatic poverty incidence is in rural areas, where 83
percent lives in extreme poverty. However, Djibouti-Ville shelters the largest number o f poor
people and contributes by itself-65 percent and 57 percent-to relative and extreme poverty,
respectively. The EDAM IS study indicates that the incidence o f relative and extreme poverty i s
the strongest among households whose heads are unemployed. Unemployment, which is
estimated at 60 percent, contributes about 65 percent to extreme poverty. What explains the
apparent paradox o f a relatively high GNI per capita o f about US$920, which places Djibouti at
close to middle income countries, and i t s high and increasing poverty rate that places i t among
the poorest? The main explanation of such a paradox lies in the sensitivity of poverty to income
distribution and on Djibouti’s budget structure which is biased against the poor.

2.2
One of the strongest results of the two poverty studies is the sensitive linkage between
poverty incidence and income distribution. The 20 percent upper income household has an
average expenditure eight times higher than the lower quintile. For l o w poverty lines, the studies
note that poverty is more sensitive to changes in expenditure inequality than to changes in mean
expenditures. I f the Gini Index o f expenditure distribution increases by 1 percent, ceteris
paribus, the extreme poverty index is estimated to increase between 1 to 4.2 percent3. The poor
are more affected by changes in expenditure inequality than by changes in mean expenditure.
This implies that an economic growth that i s accompanied by increased inequality has the
potential to be an “immiserating” growth. This highlights the critical importance o f an active
income redistribution policy that should accompany, if not even precede growth, in order for

Djibouti’s poverty reduction strategy to be effective. To reduce extreme poverty to the PRSP
goal of 19.3 percent in 2015, the PRSP i t s e l f underlines the need for “an annual real growth rate
of GDP per capita of 2.5 percent in 2005-10 and o f 3.5 percent in 2010-15, [combined with] a
regular reduction o f inequalities o f 2 percent per year.” Given the uncertain growth prospects
that are heavily dependent o f external factors, re-distribution must be an important part o f shortterm agenda o f poverty reduction.

Labor market distortion, high public sector and civil service wages, and the size of the
Government’s wage bill explain a great deal of the poverty and income distribution problem in
Djibouti. Poverty i s strongly related to unemployment in Djibouti. Unemployment has reached
60 percent up from 44 percent in 1996, and has a high incidence among the poor (66 percent),
and the extremely poor (72 percent). Djibouti has a dual labor market with about 70 percent o f
the employed in the formal sector. Fifty-five percent o f those employed in the formal sector are
civil servants. While unemployment i s at 60 percent, the average wage in the formal sector in
Djibouti remains very high. The persistence o f this paradox i s largely explained by the high

2.3

The knowledge base o n poverty stems primarily from EDAM I S studies o f 1996 and i t s 2002. Poverty information
and the statistical system in general suffer from severe shortcoming, the least o f which i s the absence o f a recent and
reliable population census on to which surveys can be anchored.
One percent as estimated by the 2002 survey and 4.2 percent was the estimate o f the 1996 survey.

5

wage level o f c i v i l service and public enterprises, which averages about $8,000, or 9 times the
GNI per capita.
2.4
High Government wages impact negatively on the poor by expanding the size of the
public wage bill and crowding out other Government spending on basic services and direct
transfers to the poor. Djibouti has, indeed, one o f the largest wage bills among its comparators,
in particular when considering the l o w service delivery level. It constitutes about 15 percent o f
GDP, 60 percent o f total fiscal revenues, and h a l f o f budget expenditures4. Considering the very
l o w base in education and health service coverage and the increasing population, reaching the
M D G s will require intensive hiring o f teachers and nurses. There are few options to meet this
new hiring-through wage cuts under the same relative size o f the wage bill, being direct cuts in
nominal wages; or through devaluation o f the exchange rate5, or through a combination o f a c i v i l
service reform involving reduction in other categories o f c i v i l service employees and wage level
reduction. As an example, Table 1 illustrates, for the education sector, the adjustment needed in
average wages in the sector to make up for the financing gap implied by a scenario o f full school
enrollment required by MDGs. The financing gap corresponds to a reduction o f the wage level
by about half, which could be an indication o f the overall overvaluation o f the wage level and
prices in general.

2.5
The political economy of such a reform is obviously difficult as it runs against the
immediate interest of thepublic sector elite itsew But inaction also has a high cost that Djibouti
policy makers need to consider seriously.
The high level and structure of civil pay has been inherited from the French colonial administration and has l i t t l e
changed since. By virtue o f Djibouti’s Currency Board system (the nominal exchange rate has not changed since
1971, inflation i s only about 2 percent, which does little to adjust down the real wages as in other developing
countries.
Since most o f the Government revenues are in dollars or indexed to it and, a part from wages, most o f other
expenditures are essentially imported are in foreign currency, a devaluation would reduce the relative s u e o f the
wage bill in the budget opening space for more hiring o f needed education and health specialists and other social
spending.

6

2.6

In addition to crowding out social expenditures, the oversized wage bill crowds out
investment in infrastructure that could directly and indirectly benefit the poor through
employment and growth. High public wages and salaries also negatively affect the overall
competitiveness of the economy and hinder growth. Redistribution in Djibouti needs to go hand
in hand, if not precede, growth.

2.7
I n the past, the inflexibility of wages and attendant wage bill have led to major
structural fiscal imbalances, and the continuous avoidance of addressing the problem upfront
has only shifted its effects to increase in other prices and further accumulation of arrears. A
growing population and higher needs for public service have exacerbated the fiscal situation over
the years. Given Djibouti’s currency board system, which excludes money creation to finance

budget deficit, financing these deficits was generally accommodated through accumulation o f
arrears, and/or an increase in taxes and surtaxes, reflected in higher prices, especially on services
and service inputs, such as electricity, water, and petroleum products (surtaxes have, for
example, reached about 30 percent o f the price o f electricity), further hindering the country’s
competitiveness (see Box 4 o n Competitiveness Indicators).
111. MACROECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENTS
AND STRUCTURAL POLICIES

3.1
Djibouti’s economy is slowly recovering from a deep recession and persistent macro
instability that characterized the late 1980s and most of the 1990s, a long period marred by

donor community. These shocks
included a civil war involving large
recruitment into the regular army,

2-

whose size jumped from 4,000 to
16,000 in 1992 alone; large inflow
of refugees from Somalia and
other, neighboring countries in
conflict estimated at 120,000 in
population at the time) increasing

Since Djibouti gained independence in 1977, it maintained a large Government sector
financed by the rents from theport,
the rent for France’s military base
and donors’ assistance.

servants continued to b e paid high
real wages, because the high nominal
wages inherited from the French
administration were protected from
inflation by Djibouti’s Currency
Board Arrangement (CBA). There

-140

‘

I

7

between 1978 and 1984 (with an average 4.2 percent growth per annum). This was boosted by
large public investments financed by generous external grants. But it was not sustainable for
long and the economy subsequently entered into a long recession with less than one percent
annual GDP growth in the face o f an average population growth o f 2.8 percent per annum. The
fiscal situation deteriorated markedly during the civil war, and the ensuing large recruitment o f
military personnel which further increased the size o f the wage bill by some 6 percent o f GDP to
reach 24 percent o f GDP by 1993. As a result, the overall fiscal deficit increased to 8.1 percent
o f GDP in 1994. This increased number o f civil servants under high public wages i s the most
challenging developmental problem that Djibouti has to solve before progress can materialize.
Because of the currency Board limitations on financing the large deficits through
3.3
monetary creation, fiscal deficits were ultimately ‘ffinanced” by the accumulation of domestic
arrears on payments of wages, pension funds contribution, and to private sector and public
entities. This, in turn, led to a loss o f credibility o f the state and an escalation in the use o f ad hoc

procedures, such as uncontrolled advanced payments, that often circumvented the normal
accounting and control system. Moreover, such procedures reduced transparency and
accountability, contributing to further overruns and distrust from Djibouti’s development
partners with decrease in grants and external financing.
To address the destabilized and deteriorating economic situation, the Government
3.4
started an adjustment program in 1996, supported, first, by an IMF Stand-By Arrangement

(SBA) during 1996-1998. A temporary restoration o f fiscal balances was achieved through large
cuts in public expenditures and a first wave o f military demobilization. But this was not
sustained as the budget position deteriorated again in 1999, and domestic arrears increased again
to reach more than 27 percent o f GDP. Growth rate was also slow at 1.5 percent in spite o f the
diversion o f all Ethiopian transit trade from Eritrea ports to the port o f Djibouti.
To enhance the stabilization effort, only partially successful under the SBA, the
Government initiated a medium-term structural adjustment program (1999-2002) supported by
an IMF Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). The Government requested IDA’S
support to i t s adjustment program. This was provided through the Fiscal Consolidation Credit in
2001 with satisfactory results.

3.5

3.6
The Fiscal Consolidation Credit focused on a core of interrelated fiscal consolidation
actions to restore financial and budgetary discipline; contain and reduce the wage bill;
improve expenditure management systems; and strengthen financial management of the key
public enterprises, and initiate a process leading to the liberalization and privatization of
selected infrastructure sectors. Notwithstanding limitations o f this fiscal consolidation program,
in particular the deliberate delay in sequencing the core issue o f high wage level and wage bill,
tangible progress was achieved. This included:
0

Halting the build-up o f domestic payment arrears, and beginning an orderly process for
clearing them. An audit was carried out that enabled the Government to validate an overall
stock o f domestic arrears payments o f DF29 billion or 27 percent o f GDP. A ten-year
prioritized settlement plan was defined and adopted by the Government and i s being
implemented on an accelerated basis for wages and on a timely basis for the rest.

8

O n pension system reform,
implementing a strong parametric
reform to improve the viability o f
the
existing
pay-as-you-go
(PAYG) pension system bringing
i t much closer to sustainability
(Box. 2).

Box 2: Djibouti’s Pension System Reform
Under the FCC and with technical assistance from the World Bank, the
Govemment undertook a comprehensive reform o f the pension system. The
reform included a range of corrective measures covering the parametric,
financial and institutional aspects o f the pension system. The parametric
reform comprised (i)unifying and extending the vesting period to 25
years to be eligible for a full retirement pension; (ii)extending the
minimum age of retirement from 50 to 55 years; (iii)changing the
calculation mode of kture pension to using an average o f salaries earned
over the last 10 years o f work, compounded by a percentage of all
contributions; (iv) changing the rules for cumulative pensions (civil
servants, Parliamentarians, and cabinet Ministers); (v) introducing a tax on
pensions of 15 percent; and (vi) ensuring a minimal yearly pension of DF
170,000 to guarantee a social safety net to pensioners. Part of the
outstandingstock of Government arrears to the pension funds were covered
by the FCC and since then, the Government resumed its regular
contribution and effective payments to pension funds. The institutional part
of the reform included the merging into one single institution of the
different pension funds, but due to design problems it didn’t progress as
expected. Completing the merger of the pension funds and expanding
coverage are reminding challenges for the Government.

On c i v i l service, close to 800 c i v i l
service employees eligible for
retirement were removed from the
payroll
and
Government
contributions to the pension fbnds
have been paid o n a regular basis.
In preparation for addressing the
wage bill and better managing the
c i v i l service, the authorities
implemented an action plan to
merge the c i v i l service and payroll
databases o n the basis o f a census o f employees, ministry by ministry.

On the reform o f the public enterprises, management o f the Port and Airport was entrusted
through a long-term management contract to an intemational investor (Dubai Port
Intemational). Independent financial and organizational audits were completed in 2003 for all
public companies. On the basis o f these financial and organizational audits, the Government
has undertaken the restructuring o f Djibouti. Telecom and a national strategy and action plan
for the regulation and liberalization o f the information and communication sectors were
adopted by the Parliament.
There has also been progress in implementing other institutional reforms to strengthen public
finance institutions and reduce the scope for mismanagement. The recently completed
Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) and Country Procurement
Assessment Review (CPAR) highlighted the improvement in the legal framework and the
achievement o f satisfactory level o f extemal control by the newly created Chamber o f
Accounts. There has been improvement in the debt management system, supported by an
Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant. Achievements in institutional management o f
public finances build o n good progress under the IMF PRGF which included: (i)
strengthening budget execution procedures; (ii)updating budgetary and treasury
nomenclatures; (ii)
reorganizing the Ministry o f Finance to provide an improved institutional
framework for effective budget preparation and execution; (iv) reforming the legal
framework governing public spending; and (v) rigorous implementation o f a treasury cash
management plan which enforced discipline and brought Government spending in line with
available resources.

3.7
Over the past 4 years there has been progress in stabilizing the budget, partly in
response to the fiscal consolidation efforts and higher port activities, and partly owing to the
windfall from the regional security situation and the establishment of new foreign military
bases. Such progress in stabilization centers o n a l o w equilibrium with an unacceptably high
poverty level. M o v i n g to a new higher equilibrium with lower poverty rates hinges o n sustaining
the ongoing macroeconomic reforms, as w e l l as addressing the more challenging central

9

structural problem o f the oversized wage bill and high wage levels. This would open the way to
more poor people sharing the public resources, rents, and donors’ grants and support.

IV. DJIBOUTI POVERTY
REDUCTION
STRATEGY (PRSP)

A.

VISION, OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY

4.1
The Country Vision. As stated in i t s recent PRSP, Djibouti’s poverty reduction strategy
aims to foster economic growth by improving the country’s overall competitiveness and building
human capital to achieve a substantial reduction in income poverty and unemployment, and
improve living conditions for all citizens. The PRSP i s structured around a long-term vision that
builds on the country’s strengths: i t s geographic location, and i t s port. The targeted reduction in
poverty i s predicated on enhancing the conditions for stronger, more equitable and sustainable
growth.
The Objectives. The PRSP objectives are as follows: (i)
to reduce the incidence o f
4.2
extreme poverty from 42.2 percent in 2002 to 36.1 percent in 2006, to 27.9 percent in 2010, and
to 19.2 percent in 2015; (ii)
to increase the average real GDP growth to 4.6 percent in 2004-06,
to 5.5 percent in 2006-10, and to 6.5 percent in 2010-15, while simultaneously reducing the
inequalities in income distribution by an average 2 percent per annum during 2003-15; (iii)
to
increase gross primary school enrollment from 42.7 percent in 2001/02 to 73 percent in 2005/06,
and to achieve universal enrollment by 2015; (iv) to reduce the infant mortality rate from 103.1
per thousand in 2002, to 75 per thousand in 2006, and to 50 per thousand in 2015; (v) to reduce
the infant-juvenile mortality rate from 124.5 per thousand in 2002, to 85 per thousand in 2006,
and to 70 per thousand in 2015; (vi) to reduce the matemal mortality rate from 690 per 100,000
live births in 2002, to 570 in 2006, and to 400 in 2015; and (vii) to stabilize the rate o f
prevalence o f HIV at approximately 3 percent by 2015.
The Strategy. The PRSP rests on four main pillars. Thefirstpillar seeks to strengthen
4.3
the country’s competitiveness and to create conditions conducive to a strong and sustainable
the pursuit o f fiscal prudence and overall macroeconomic stability;
economic growth through (i)
(ii)
the implementation o f structural reforms to attract private investment, including the revision
o f the legal and judicial framework (an investment climate assessment i s planned for FY08); (iii)
the promotion o f Djibouti as a competitive economic and financial hub; and (iv) the reduction in
the costs o f production factors through improved efficiency o f investments in the infrastructure
sectors (water, power, transport). The secondpillar aims to accelerate the development o f human
resources through the implementation o f social programs aimed at reducing poverty and gender
disparities. In particular, the aim i s to: (i)
improve the coverage and quality o f health care and
reduce unemployment through the development o f labor-intensive activities,
education; (ii)
micro-finance provision, and job training, (iii)
set up social safety nets for the most vulnerable
segments o f the population; and (iv) implement the national gender strategy. The third pillar
focuses on regional and local development through investments in water and basic services in
poor neighborhoods located in rural and urban areas o f the country. The fourth pillar seeks to
improve govemance and public sector management. The priority will be to strengthen the
transparency and accountability o f public expenditure management to improve i t s distributional
and efficiency impact on the poor.

10

B. MEDIUM-TERM MACROECONOMIC
PROSPECTS UNDER THE CAS PERIOD (2005-08)

4.4

I n the base case medium-term scenario, Djibouti would witness a relatively improved
growth rate owing to the higher investment in the port and the pursuit of reforms aiming to
improve the efficiency of investments. A surge in private investment due to the construction o f
the new modem port in Doraleh and a higher public investment in support o f the Government’s
PRSP are expected to boost growth during the period 2005-08 to an average rate o f 4 percent a
year, at a higher pace than in the past, but less than the 4.6 percent per annum on average
anticipated in the PRSP. Inflation i s expected to remain at i t s current average o f 2 percent as

long as the currency board is maintained.

4.5
Fiscal consolidation would be pursued to offset pressures on public finances stemming
from the PRSP implementation. The pursuit o f the budgetary consolidation effort (barring an
expected slippage during the first h a l f o f 2005 which corresponds to the Presidential electoral
period) should result in achieving a surplus in the primary budget close to 4 percent o f GDP o n
average per annum. Such a surplus i s also needed to ensure a continued implementation o f the
Government plan for clearing domestic arrears. Fiscal consolidation will be achieved through
efforts o n both expenditure and revenue sides. On the revenue side, additional extemal
disbursements o f military bases rental linked to new military agreements with the United States
and France (representing about 3 percentage points o f GDP o n average per annum), will

materialize over the projected period, and tax revenues are projected to remain stable before the
new VAT i s introduced and implemented. On the expenditure side, total expenditures level will
remain overall stable. A shift in the structure o f expenditures toward higher capital spending
linked to PRSP implementation will be partially balanced by lower current expenditures through
the pursuit o f retirement programs and military demobilization and the rationalization o f other
non-wage current expenditures.
4.6
Current account pressures would intensifjl financing needs, but the external debt-toGDP ratio will remain stable over the period 2005-2008. Total financing needs are expected to
increase from US$135 million in 2003 to US$164 million by 2006, and decline thereafter to
reach US$ 129 million by 2008. Higher current account deficits during the PRSP implementation
period (2004-06) will be financed through additional extemal assistance, mostly in the form o f
official grants. Additional new lending i s expected to be negotiated on concessional terms.
Fiscal consolidation efforts and prudent borrowing should help maintain Government debt-toGDP to sustainable levels (with external debt averaging 68 percent o f GDP during the projected
period). The base case scenario also envisages a steady inflow o f foreign direct investment,
although the pace will critically depend upon maintaining the investors’ confidence in the
Government commitment to enhance competitiveness, rule o f law and economic and social
stability.

THELAST
CAS ACHIEVEMENTS AND LESSONS

The strategic focus of the last CAS (2001-2004) was to support the Government effort
5.1
to reduce poverty in two main ways:
0

0

A.

Interventions to enhance human capital development, giving priority to reversing one o f the
worst rates o f school enrollment in the world, addressing the deteriorated health situation, in
particular in the critical area o f HIV/AIDS, and promoting a more direct support program to
the poor through an active public works and community service program.
Restoring growth by: (i)consolidating fiscal stability and improving economic
competitiveness necessary to jumpstart growth; and (ii)
rehabilitation o f infrastructure and
services related to the port as the main source o f growth in Djibouti.

OUTCOMES
N
I HUMAN
RESOURCE
DEVELOPMENT

5.2

There was impressive progress made in human resource development, with very
tangible accomplishments in education.
Early results from the School Access and
Improvement Program, still under implementation, show an impressive 12.5 percent increase in
the rate o f enrollment over the first three years o f the project implementation. This first project
o f a three-phase Education APL focused essentially o n filling the huge gap in the supply side:

building and rehabilitation and management o f schools, providing textbooks and supplies,
training teachers and developing curriculum. The effectiveness and satisfactory implementation
of the project triggered interest from other donors and discussions are underway for a donor wide
education-for-all initiative.

I n the other sectors, the two health projects, HIV/AIDS Malaria and TB Control, and
Health Sector Development project have had a good implementation start. The Social
Development and Public Works project helped extend economic and social infrastructure to
poor communities, including road, drainage and water supply network improvement,
rehabilitation o f health and social services, marketplaces, and preparation and implementation o f
participatory community development plans. The project also helped promote small construction

5.3

and service contractors’ capacity building, which prepares local SMEs to take advantage o f other
business and work opportunities offered by military bases and new developments. The expected
employment creation impact was, however, more modest than expected.
B.

OUTCOMES IN THE AREAS OF FISCAL CONSOLIDATION,

RESUMPTION

COMPETITIVENESS

AND

GROWTH

5.4
I n the second area of strategic focus of the CAS i.e., restoring economic growth
through improvement of the port-linked infrastructure and structural adjustment and fiscal
consolidation, macro stability was re-established and GDP per capita re-commenced its
growth, but the impact on poverty reduction was rather disappointing. The IDA-financed
Emergency Road Corridor Rehabilitation project and a supplemental credit to this project, were
instrumental to the timely removal o f a binding constraint to port activities. The project
responded to the reorientation o f Ethiopia’s foreign trade route to the port o f Djibouti following

the Ethiopian-Eritrea war in 1998. Total port traffic rose to 6.0 million tons in 2003, compared
to solely 1.7 million in 1997.

13

5.5

I n the area of structural reforms, IDA-Jinanced Fiscal Consolidated Credit supported
the most critical policy reforms over the past four years, in particular in the area o f pension
system reform, arrears management and clearing, and public enterprises reform (section 111).
Djibouti's fiscal situation has been brought closer to stability, with improved-though s t i l l far
from satisfactory-public finance management. Since 2002, Djibouti's GDP per capita growth
has reverted to a positive trajectory after a long period o f decline. However, the impact on
poverty has been disappointing with the dramatic worsening o f poverty indicators between 1996
and 2002 (section 11). With no indication that this tendency has been reversed during the CAS
period, the pressing need to confront upfront and actively the income distribution problem in
Djibouti i s underscored.

C. PORTFOLIOMANAGEMENT
5.6
Portfolio management over the past CAS period improved dramatically. The project
portfolio showed a dramatic turn around with all portfolio indicators turning from highly
unsatisfactory to satisfactory or highly satisfactory. Ratings for development objective and
implementation progress of all projects in the portfolio are currently satisfactory. The
disbursement ratio has progressively increased to reach 28 percent in FY04, compared to only 6
percent in FYOO and to the target of 18 percent set in the CAS. Disbursement lags have been
reduced significantly, and project implementation time and efficiency have also improved. In
particular, the Education project will be closing a year ahead o f schedule leading the way to an
earlier than expected start of the second phase o f the Education APL. The implementation o f
both the International Corridor project and the Social Development and Public Works project
progressed much better and much faster then planned; and the Board approved two supplemental
credits on June 5,2003 and June 26,2003 respectively for these projects.

Factors that have contributed to the improvement in the quality and speed of
5.7
implementation include: (i)focused, and simpler design o f the projects adapted to local
implementation capacity; (ii)a more intensive supervision o f the portfolio with a problemsolving approach, supported by closer involvement o f the Country Management Unit and an
excellent dialogue with the Government; and (iii)
a more proactive and professional External
Financing Coordination Unit within the Ministry o f that helped quickly address the problems as

they arose.

VI. BANKGROUP
ASSISTANCE
STRATEGY

A.

CHOICE OF FOCUS OF THE NEW
CAS

During the consultation process, the Bank team and the authorities discussed two
6.1
options as to how to focus the CASprogram to bring about higher effectiveness given the large
demand for IDA support and the limited available IDA allocation.

6.2
The first option was to target the CAS program to one of the four pillars of the PRSP
that the Government and IDA considered the most important (e.g. social development), to bring
about a critical difference in this particular area.
6.3
The second option was to cover more areas of the PRSP, at the cost of spreading
resources more thinly, using small but strategic interventions of mixed lending and ESW in
each of the important areas. The objective would be to bring Bank good practices and
knowledge to bear in more than one area o f the PRSP, and to unlock higher mobilization of
donor partner resources and assistance in these sectors. Several donors have experienced slow
implementation o f their programs due to difficulties in dialogue on critical sectoral policy and
institutional reform areas. Some donors have expressed interest in IDA’s involvement in their
area o f involvement/support because of: (i)
IDA’s comparatively good quality sector work (on

education, water and sewerage, energy, transport and the port, public enterprise reform, the
pension system, C F A A and CPAR); (ii)IDA’s relatively good dialogue o n critical structural
issues advanced under the FCC process; and (iii)the good momentum and excellent
collaborative spirit and trust prevailing between the Government and the Bank.
The second option is favored. I t will allow the Bank to build o n the previous CAS
6.4
program, which was essentially in line with the PRSP priorities, thereby allowing, to a certain
limit, for the needed critical mass to attain the developmental objectives o f the program and
create the desired changes and improvements.

B. ALIGNMENTTO THE PRSP PILLAR OF IMPROVING COMPETITIVENESS, GROWTH
AND INCOME
DISTRIBUTION

6.5
The envisaged CAS program in support of the PRSP pillar of growth and
competitiveness involves several interconnected actions, building on the investment and
structural adjtlstment programs started under the previous CAS. Specifically, it involves: (i)
moving a step W h e r in addressing fiscal consolidation, improving competitiveness, and income
distribution--this would be carried out through a combination o f further wage bill adjustments to
create more fiscal room to expand priority public services and transfers to the poor, and through
the restructuring o f utility sectors (power and water) to reduce the costs o f doing business and

15

improve access o f the poor to these essential public services; (ii)
sustaining development and
improved management o f the Ethiopia Djibouti transport infrastructure in support o f port
activities, the economic backbone for growth and employment; and (iii)
vocational training to
enable local w o r k force take advantage o f spillover activities related to the expansion o f the port.
B.1 Assistance in support of wage bill reduction and expenditure restructuring
6.6
reform: As highlighted above (Section 11), the relative size o f the public wage bill in the budget
i s too high, mostly driven by an average high wage o f about 9 times the GDP per capita. This
limits severely the fiscal room to hire more teachers and health professionals and to provide
transfers and assistance to the poorest to meet the PRSP and Millennium Development Goals.
There are really no other options than to tradeoff high wages to higher recruitment. This i s
possible through the combination o f restructuring (less o f administrative and security personnel
and more o f public service professionals) lower real wage levels through any politically feasible
combination o f direct nominal wage cuts, and adjustment o f the exchange rate. In addition to the
direct effects o f this reform, these actions could also reduce business costs, enhancing growth
through improving competitiveness, and provide fiscal space also for raising investment and
maintenance expenditures in the physical infrastructure base, thereby reaching and benefiting the
poor both directly and indirectly.
Planned IDA assistance. On the analytical and technical side, IDA assistance would
6.7
consist o f economic and sector work and technical support covering the critical aspects o f the
wage bill restructuring reform. This includes a C E M based on a series o f focused analytical
policy notes covering the different components o f the reform and assessing their economic and
social impact, their phasing, and the alleviation o f their impact o n the poor; and finalizing the
Public Expenditure Review with emphasis on restructuring expenditure in key sectors. On the
lending side, IDA assistance would consist, under a high case scenario, of a second fiscal
consolidation credit, supporting the second phase o f reforms undertaken under the FCC,
focusing o n wage bill and public expenditure restructuring.

6.8
B2. Restructuring the utilities sector as a means of enhancing competitiveness and
improving access to services to the poor: The utility sectors, mainly power and water, haw

been identified in the PRSP as key bottlenecks

to
improving the
overall
economic
competitiveness. The issue i s the very high

electricity and water services are the highest in meter’

US$0.20/kWh for electricity, and U S $ l .l

for water (as compared to MENA average o f

several, but notably: the higher cost o f

electricity production due to a reliance o n
imported diesel fuel for power generation; large inefficiencies in the form o f network losses;
high administrative overhead costs due to overstaffing; inordinately high wages (see Box 4); and
high levels o f taxation (33 percent taxes o n all petroleum products and about 20 percent more o f

16

surtaxes6). IDA has played a leading role in assisting the Government in assessing the financial
performance o f the power and water companies through the FCC. The two sector strategy notes
on power and water and PRSP work have identified an action plan for both sectors focusing on
the following key objectives: (i)
improving the efficiency and financial performance o f the
utilities through restructuring and promotion o f private sector participation; (ii)
addressing key
service-delivery constraints through rehabilitation o f networks and protection o f resources; and
(iii)
exploring new resources for water supply (e.g., desalination) and power generation (e.g.,
renewable energy and interconnection possibilities).
Box 4: Competitiveness IndicatorsI n Djibouti
High wages and high wage bilL An IMF survey was conducted to compare wage and price levels in Djibouti, Addis
Ababa (Ethiopia) and Sana’a (Yemen). The survey revealed that Djibouti’s wages are much higher than those of
neighboring countries. At 1999 exchange rates, wages in Djibouti were 3 to 6 % times the level of those in Ethiopia
and Yemen. The differentials were generally higher for skilled and semi-skilled employees (public servants, and hotel
and restaurant staff) than for unskilled workers (manual laborers and domestic servants). The apparent insensitivity of
wage rates to the high level of unemployment may reflect the benchmark established by the dominant public sector,
which accounts for approximately half of the total reported wage earner population (or almost three-quarters when
public enterprises are included in the public sector). In 1998, the average wage rate in Djibouti’s civil service was
indeed about 45 percent above the average wage rate o f workers in the private sector and public enterprises. Estimated
average salaries for public sector employees were more than five times the level in Ethiopia and about four times the
level of comparable employees in Yemen.
High utilities prices. Djibouti faces high production costs associated with utility prices. In particular, the price o f the
kW/hour for industries was about 26 cents in 2000, and the cost of telephone calls abroad ranged from more than
US$1 per minute to neighboring countries to almost US$3 per minute to Europe, and US$ 4 to the United States.
Utilities are expensive primarily because of high wages, a large tax burden, and poor management practices. When
looking at public enterprise accounts, it appears that wages and salaries of public enterprises range from 3 1 percent o f
value added for Djibouti-Telecom, to 77 percent for the airport. The wage bill of the electricity company was 51
percent in 2000. Poor collection rates and fraud are other problems faced by some public enterprises, including the
electricity and water company.
High service prices. Higher prices of transport contribute to the fact that road traffic between Djibouti and Ethiopia i s
mostly handled by Ethiopian companies, which pay lower wages to their drivers than those paid to Djibouti drivers.
Other prices o f services (recreational, tailoring, shoe repairing, apartment rents) are much more expensive in Djibouti.
As a result, the ratio of non-tradable prices to tradable prices i s higher in Djibouti than in its two neighboring
countries.
High Real exchange rate (REER). Following the depreciation o f the U S dollar in effective terms, Djibouti’s real
effective exchange rate depreciated between 2002 and 2004 by about 30 percent. Despite this depreciation the REER
remained overvalued compared to the early 1990s (over 20 percent). Such an overvalued exchange rate continues to
undermine the country’s overall competitiveness.

6.9
Planned IDA assistance would consist o f a dual power and water project. The IDA
contribution towards this project i s expected to be about US$7 million. In addition, a GEF grant
towards renewable and energy efficiency improvement i s being pursued and would be in the
range o f US$2.5 to US$3.5 million. The power sector-related components would include a small
investment in the distribution network in Djibouti-Ville to rehabilitate and extend the network to
un-served residential consumers, as well as to the commercial district; and the construction o f a
small wind farm to serve an interior town. The water sector component will focus o n initiating
protective measures o f the aquifer that serves 70 percent o f Djibouti’s population. However,
although the Bank’s contribution to the critical needs o f the water sector are limited due to the
constraints o f the IDA envelope, the Bank will work closely with the EU who i s preparing a
large water sector investment project (US$20 million) and has requested that i t s project be linked

revised within a potential new fiscal consolidation follow up operation.

17

to the Bank’s activities in terms o f overall development objectives (see below under the
institutional component). Another component will focus on the institutional restructuring o f the
power and water utilities and the associated regulatory frameworks. IDA involvement in the
sectors’ institutional restructuring builds on the work undertaken under the FCC. In addition, the
EU, the largest donor in the water sector, has requested Bank leadership in sectoral reform, and
i s conditioning the release o f i t s investment fbnds on the implementation o f reforms in the sector.
Box 5: Utilities’ Unit Performance Compared to MNA’s Good Practice
The price for electricity and water in Djibouti i s much higher than in other countries in the region, and
also when compared to good general industry practice more generally. Average electricity tariffs in the
region range from US#9ikWh to industry and US#6kWh to households in Yemen; US#6kWh to
industry and households in Jordan and USf6.9kWh to industry and US#9.5kWh to households in
Morocco. In Djibouti, the average selling price i s US#20kWh, but commercial customers including
small enterprises pay as much as US#32/kWh and the Office National des Eaux de Djibouti (ONED)
pays US.4lkWh. The same applies to the water sector, where the lowest tariff to households reaches
US#35/m3, compared to US#25/m3in Yemen; US#22/m3 in Jordan, and US#20/m3in Morocco. Good
practice in electricity i s an average tariff of between US#10-15kWh. I t i s more difficult to have a
benchmark for water since it varies greatly with the source and amount o f water resources.
The sectors also suffer from overstaffing, which i s of serious concem, given the high cost o f labor in
Djibouti. Measured in relationship to number of connections, the Djibouti Electricity Authority (EDD)
has 3 1 connections per employees whereas good practice i s 70- 100. Measured slightly differently for
the water sector, ONED has 21 employees per active 1,000 connections, while good practice i s in the
range of 4 to 6.

6.10 B3. Development and rehabilitation of the transport infrastructure in support of the
Port of Djibouti as the engine of economic growth and employment: Djibouti has put the
development o f the port and the transport sectors at the heart o f i t s poverty reduction strategy.
The potential o f the port as an engine o f growth looks clearer today than in the mid-1990s when
the port was losing most o f its transshipment traffic to other competing ports in the region. The
situation i s much improved today because o f the sharp increase in port traffic following the
Ethiopian-Eritrea war in 1998, combined with the rehabilitation o f the road link to Ethiopia,
which was supported by IDA’S emergency Road Corridor Rehabilitation Project and a
supplemental credit, as well as the Government’s decision to transfer the port management to a
private operator. This stimulated considerably port activity (traffic increased by 165 percent
between 1997 and 2002), and more than compensated for the drop in transshipment.
6.11 The first challenge for Djibouti i s to preserve the Ethiopian transit traffic by improving
the attractiveness and competitiveness o f the port, as well as i t s transportation logistical l i n k s
with i t s hinterland. The second challenge i s to maximize the port’s significant growth and
employment potential by regaining and expanding i t s share in transshipment and diversifying
related business, including a potential free trade zone (FTZ).
6.12 Improvement in both physical infrastructure and the institutional setting are needed for
the port o f Djibouti to play i t s role as the gateway to and from i t s hinterland, especially vis-a-vis
Ethiopia. Regarding the port, a new o i l terminal i s being built at the Dorale site with private
financing to alleviate the operational constraints posed by the old o i l facilities in the current port
site.
6.13 A long-term plan to develop the Djibouti-Addis Ababa Corridor started with the I D A supported rehabilitation o f the Djibouti-Galafi road, encompassing also the development o f the
rail link between Djibouti and Addis. The European Union i s also financing a hture improved

18

road link between Djibouti and Addis Ababa, in addition to i t s financing o f emergency repairs to
the rail link to bring it up to an acceptable level for efficient and safe operations.
6.14 On the institutional side, Djibouti’s decision to have a partnership with the private sector
in port and airport management has been successful thus far, and lays the ground for more such
partnerships. Preparation i s underway for a concession scheme for the rail link between Djibouti
and Addis Ababa through the privatization o f “Chemin de Fer Djibouto-Ethiopien ”, a jointnational company operating the 800-kilometer rail link between Djibouti and Addis.
Governments in both countries now sponsor this scheme.
Box 6: Development of the Port o f Djibouti
Djibouti has put the development of the port and the transport sector at the heart o f its poverty reduction strategy. The potential
of the port as an engine o f growth looks clearer today than in the mid 1990s when the port was losing most o f its transshipment
traffic to other competing ports in the region. The sharp increase in port traffic following the Ethiopian-Eritrea war in 1998,
combined with the rehabilitation of the road link to Ethiopia, which was supported by IDA’s emergency Road Corridor
Rehabilitation Project and a supplemental credit, as well as the Government’s decision to transfer the port management to a
private operator stimulated considerably port activity. Total port traffic rose to 5.97 million tons in 2003, compared to 4.55
million tons in 2002 and solely 1.7 million in 1997, which more than compensated for the drop in transshipment. The challenge
for Djibouti i s to first preserve Ethiopian transit trafic by improving the attractiveness and the competitiveness o f the port and its
logistics links with its hinterland, and then to seek to diversify the port’s business.
Strengthening the competitiveness of theport of Djibouti and logistics links with its hinterland. Improvement of both physical
infrastructure and institutional settings i s needed for the port of Djibouti to play its role as the gate to and from its hinterland, and
mainly Ethiopia. On the port side, a new oil terminal i s being built at Dorale site with private financing to alleviate the current
operational constraints posed by the old oil facilities in the current port site. A long-term plan to develop the Djibouti-Addis
Corridor started with the IDA’s supported rehabilitation of the Djibouti-Galafi road and it also encompasses development o f the
rail link between Djibouti and Addis. The European Union i s financing a future improved road link between Djibouti and Addis
Ababa along the same route as the existing rail link via Ali-Sabieh in Djibouti and Dire-Dawa in Ethiopia. The E U i s also
financing emergency repairs to the rail link to bring it up to an acceptable level for efficient and safe operations. On the
institutional side, Djibouti’s decision to have a partnershipwith the private sector in port management was so far successful and i t
lays the ground for more such partnerships. Preparation i s underway o f a concession scheme for the rail link between Djibouti
and Addis through the privatization of “Chemin de Fer Djibouto-Ethiopien (CFDE) ”, a joint-national company operating the
800-kilometer rail link between Djibouti and Addis. T h i s scheme i s now sponsored by Governments in both countries. A
national road strategy aimed at improving the institutional arrangements o f the road sector including road management and
financing of road maintenance i s being carried out under the emergency road corridor rehabilitation project. T h i s CAS proposes
support in this area through a Partial Risk Guarantee in support of the concession to the privatization o f the CFDE, and a
transport strategy study.
Diversifying the port’s business and related activities. The Government and the private operator of the port have set as a
strategic goal to increase Djibouti’s share in the very competitive regional transshipment traffic. The construction with private
participation o f a new deepwater container terminal at Dorale site along with an industrial and commercial free zone i s on their
agenda. While the activities of this proposed port are rather capital than labor intensive, a successful free zone should be a
significant source of employment. If this ambitious project did materialize, for it to benefit the economic and social development
of the country, special attention should be focused to train a qualified labor force on one hand, and to reduce the extremely high
cost of labor in Djibouti on the other hand. This CAS supports address the first area through the proposed Partial Risk Guarantee.

6.15 Planned IDA assistance would consist o f an IDA partial risk guarantee, which could be
matched by the same amount from Ethiopia with which coordination i s under way, to the
concession being considered to mitigate the risks associated with such a complex bi-national
project. IDA i s also carrying out a Transport Sector Review aimed at improving the institutional
arrangements o f the road sector, including road management and financing o f road maintenance.
IDA will support the Government in adopting and implementing the recommendations o f this
Review.

THE

PRSP

PILLAR OF

HUMAN
RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT
AND POVERTY

6.16 The focus of the previous CAS on human development was also aligned with what
subsequently became the second pillar o f the PRSP. This CAS continues IDA support in the
same area covered in the previous CAS with additional lending except in health, where two
operations (Health Sector Development; and HIV/AIDS) have just started and their
implementation should cover the required IDA support in this sector over the next four years.
6.17 C1. Continuing support for an accelerated school access and improvement agenda:
The first phase of Djibouti’s School Access and Improvement Adaptable Program Lending
(APL), the first IDA project in education, i s being completed one year ahead o f schedule with
significant and encouraging results in several areas: (i)
increased enrollment with a primary gross
enrollment ratio (GER) of 52 percent compared to 39.5 percent at the start o f the project in 2000;
(ii)
decreased grade repeater rates from 10 percent to 7 percent; (iii)
increased availability o f
textbook at a ratio of 1:l; (iv) increased teacher training; (v) revised curriculum; and (vi)
achievement o f all the triggers agreed upon to move the second Phase o f the APL.
Planned IDA assistance would consist of a second accelerated school access and
improvement project for the second phase of the education APL. The objectives o f this project
are to expand coverage of quality basic education through targeted activities which contribute to
increased access and retention rates of the system, and to further reduce repetition and drop-out

6.18

rates. The specific objective o f this phase i s to increase the enrollment to 70 percent by 2008,
with special emphasis on girls education, in line with the PRSP targets. IDA will work closely
with other donors to mobilize additional financial resources for reaching this target. An
Education Sector Strategy Assessment will be prepared in FY07.

6.19 C2. Continuing support for employment generation and direct support to the poor:
With respect to employment generation and social development, the last CAS program consisted
o f the consolidation and expansion o f a Social Development and Public Works Program. The
program contributed to poverty reduction through: (i)
construction and rehabilitation o f social
and economic infrastructure in the poorest neighborhoods with a direct impact on the living
conditions o f the poor (such as street works, drainage, water and sanitation systems, local
markets, schools, and health care facilities), while at the same time, offering employment
supporting community development through social mobilization programs and
opportunities; (ii)
investment grants for the creation o f community facilities; and (iii)
institutional capacity building
by developing the capability of small local private contractors to enable them to benefit from
opportunities offered by the port development, the military bases and other activities; and also
improving the institutional capacity o f the Government, communities and NGOs to design and
implement poverty reduction interventions.
6.20 One o f the main factors characterizing the unemployment situation in Djibouti i s the lack
o f basic skilled labor and the lack o f training to address this problem. Addressing this
impediment to employment would enable labor force to better take advantage o f existing and
potential service activities developments, in particular that o f construction and other services
related to the military bases, and transport related to the port, as well as to the potential demand
from its ongoing expansion and possible free zone development.

20

6.21

Planned IDA assistance would consist o f a credit focused on employment creation with

two components: (i)
rehabilitation o f basic services (in particular water and sewerage system) in

one o f the poorest districts (the Cartier Dariba); and (ii)
financing o f a small focused Vocational
Training project to enable unemployed young people to take advantage o f expected employment
opportunities linked to the development o f the port. IDA support will continue in the area o f
pension system reform (under the Planned second Fiscal Consolidation Credit) and an
employment strategy note (CEM).

6.22 C3. Providing support to poor victims o f the flood: The PRSP highlights the
vulnerability o f Djibouti to various natural disaster dangers and emphasizes need for developing
prevention and management capacity. An Emergency Floods Rehabilitation project for $6.4
million was approved in September 2004 to assist the Government o f Djibouti in helping people
hurt by the floods that devastated the region in April 2004, that impacted about 15 percent o f the
population, or about 100,000 people. Most o f the affected population lives in the poorest areas.
Support will be given to rehabilitate social and economic infrastructure (e.g., housing, schools,
medical centers) that was damaged. The project also includes technical assistance to support
short and long-term disaster prevention management plans.
6.23 C4. Providing support in other key problematic social areas: As identified above
(paras. 1.10-1-14), women in Djibouti bear additional disadvantages and burden that the PRSP
recognize as key hurdles in the way o f uplifting the well being o f the whole society. The PRSP,
however, does not deal adequately with the Qat issue, because there i s less internal consensus
about the problem. IDA assistance under the CAS program will, nevertheless, address both
issues.
6.24 Planned IDA assistance to furthering the gender agenda: The UNDP and UNFPA are
providing assistance to the Ministry o f Gender, mainly in capacity building. The IDA-financed
Social Development and Public Works project provided credit to micro-enterprises, many o f
which are run by women. The Planned new Social Development and Public Works I1 credit
would follow step. The first School Access and Improvement project under the previous CAS
has met i t s explicit targets for reducing the gender gap in schooling. The second School Access
project, under this CAS will further aid in this effort with s t i l l greater emphasis on girls
schooling. The Health project, currently under implementation, also aims at reducing the high
rates o f infant and matemal mortality. A coordinated effort will be made with donors to support
NGOs in the on-going public awareness and education campaign for the elimination o f FGM
practice.
6.25 Planned I D A assistance to address the Qat problem: IDA efforts will aim at building
consensus in the country on the importance o f this issue in terms o f i t s serious social and
economic consequences. An assessment o f the social and economic implications o f Qat import
and consumption at the household and macro levels will be made within the framework o f the
programmed work on poverty assessment. IDA will raise the issue more prominently in i t s
policy dialogue with the authorities. IDA will j o i n other donors in the effort o f raising awareness
about the harmful effects o f Qat consumption and provide support to national initiatives to
address this problem.

21

D. ALIGNMENTTO THE PRSP PILLAR OF PROMOTING GOODGOVERNANCE
6.26 The PRSP emphasizes governance improvement as one o f the main pillars o f
development and poverty reduction. In this agenda, governance improvement i s defined broadly
as furthering the promotion of good political, local, economic and financial governance,
strengthening the capacity for planning and administrative management and modernizing it.
Priority in this agenda is given to ensuring transparent and efficient management o f public
expenditure, and to improving equity and effectiveness in order to transform governance into “a
true instrument for combating poverty.”
6.27 Two key I D A fiduciary activities, a CFAA and a CPAR, have been finalized in addition to
a Public Expenditure Review. These constitute a strong basis for identifylng improvement areas
and a concrete program of actions that the authorities are willing to undertake to move forward
o n their governance agenda
6.28 In the area of public financial management, the C F A A noted a relatively good quality o f
the legal framework, a satisfactory level o f the external control carried o n by the newly created
Chamber o f Accounts, and a relative improvement in the system o f payments and accounting. On
the other hand, it pointed to major weaknesses undermining the management and transparency o f
public spending. The three areas o f weaknesses identified and examined by the CFAA concern
budget formulation, execution, and internal control.
6.29 The CPAR collaborative exercise also pointed to several weaknesses in public
procurement which diminish the absorptive capacity, and deprive the country from fully
benefiting from available donor financing. Absorptive capacity remains hampered by several
procurement weaknesses at different levels, including an incomplete and complex procurement
code; an unclear legislative and regulatory framework; lengthy and inefficient procurement
procedures; loss o f private sector confidence due to large Government arrears leading to
exaggerated risk premiums; and weaknesses in the customs’ institutions at both the institutional
and human resource levels.
6.30 Theplanned IDA assistance would consist o f support in implementing the detailed and
phased program of actions in the areas of financial management and public procurement, which
have been identified and discussed collaboratively with the authorities, the private sector, and the
donor community during a workshop organized by the Government. IDA would support this
PRSP Governance improvement pillar with two IDFs (to implement the CPAR and C F A A policy
recommendations), which would also be complemented by technical assistance from other
donors.

E. LENDING
SCENARIOS AND TRIGGERS

6.31 The base-case lending program of about US$31 million will fully utilize Djibouti’s
IDA indicative allocation for the next four years*. The base case i s predicated on continued
satisfactory macroeconomic management and good portfolio performance. The CAS does not
envisage a low case scenario because of: i)negligible probability o f base case triggers not being
met; (ii)
the small size o f IDA allocation in the base case; and (iii)
the remaining lending
program beyond FY05 i s essentially in education and poverty alleviation. The alternative
lending case scenario i s thus limited to a high case scenario.
6.32 The high case lending scenario would provide for US$9 million above the base case
I t would consist o f a poverty reduction credit in support o f scaling up the fiscal consolidation
agenda started during the last CAS with a Fiscal Consolidation Credit (FCC). The second FCC
will focus on public expenditure restructuring with emphasis on the wage bill (structure o f civil
service and wage level adjustment) with the objectives, as highlighted above of: (i)
creating
needed fiscal room for higher public service spending, (ii)
improving income distribution and
direct transfers to the poor; and (iii)
enhancing overall competitiveness o f the economy. The
triggers for the high case scenario would consist of: satisfactory IDA portfolio performance with
no more than two problem projects in the portfolio; satisfactory progress in implementation o f

’Out o f the project cost o f USS6.4 million, $3.2 million i s in the form o f a grant, and an equal amount i s in the form o f an I D A
credit.
This envelope w i l l be finalized subsequently along I D A 1 4 rules and I D A 1 4 funds availability.

credible and sustainable reform program o f wage bill restructuring and enhancing

F. IDA LENDING
TERMSAND DJIBOUTI’S
INFLATED GNI PER CAPITA
6.33 Djibouti G N I p e r capita of US$920 has became higher than the operational cutoff for
eligibility for 40-year IDA funding of US$S95 over the past three years. This high level o f GNI
per capita in dollar terms i s to a large extent artificially inflated by the overvalued exchange rate.
I t does not reflect the extent o f prevailing poverty in Djibouti as highlighted above. Unless the
Government addresses the underlining factors o f i t s inflated GNI per capita, it will deprive
Djibouti from the needed IDA softer terms. This i s in addition to the beneficial implication that
such policy reform could have in correcting the income distribution bias against the poor as
discussed in section 11.
G. COORDINATION WITH DEVELOPMENT
PARTNERS

6.34 Quite in contrast with the improvement in IDA portfolio performance and dialogue
with the Government, many partners express frustration about dijjficult policy dialogue and
slow project implementation. Several large and critical projects have been in the pipeline for a
long time without materializing. Portfolio performance i s also un-even across partners. This
underscores the need to assess donors’ collective experience with Djibouti and share lessons o f
what has worked well and what did not as the donors community prepares to pledge its future
assistance to Djibouti’s PRSP during the Consultative Group (CG) meetings to be organized this
summer.
6.35 The PRSP preparation and consultation process, in which donors were associated,
offered a good opportunity for a shared understanding of the Government strategy and
priorities. Through its PRSP, Djibouti has its first comprehensive and consistent vision and
strategy o f development and poverty reduction since independence. The PRSP processes led
donors to start refocusing their assistance o n a more informed basis along the Government
priorities. The process has also forced the start o f a more active coordination among the donor
community which should intensify at the Consultative Group meeting that would be chaired by
the World Bank. IDA would work with donor agencies to ensure that: (i)
policy or institutional

24

advise i s mutually consistent; (ii)
investment programs addressing the priorities o f the PRSP are
consistent and do not overlap; (iii)
donors share sectoral and economic analysis and information;
and (iv) IDA and donors operational procedures (e.g., for procurement, accounting, and audit)
are as standardized as possible to ease project implementation.
6.36 This CAS, prepared in close collaboration with the donor community, is designed to
complement and support other donors’ effort. (see section VI-A). I t specifically arranged some

o f the lending and non-lending operations to address problems that constrain other donors
support (as i s the case with the water and power project for example) and use any comparative
advantage IDA might have to help in this regard. As shown in the CAS results matrix (Annex
B9) there are already many synergies between IDA assistance and other donors’ proposed
interventions. These will be further clarified as donors’ consultation on defining respective
assistance to the PRSP investment program progress.
6.37
More specifically, the World Bank will continue its strong collaboration with the IMF
and will ensure that a consistent message i s conveyed on the macroeconomic, public finance
management and other structural reforms. The planned second Fiscal Consolidation Credit
(FCC) would reinforce and complement the IMF’s potential PRGF program as it was the case
with the first FCC. On other areas, such as in the water, power, and transport sectors, IDA’S
assistance both in lending and in analytical (AAA) work i s being prepared in close collaboration
with the EU and complements i t s investment and assistance in sector reforms as well as the
AfDB’s intervention in the energy sector. The Bank i s also supporting in-country aid
coordination led by other donors through sector-level technical assistance (e.g., Djibouti
education local donor group led by France). There i s also close collaboration with the UN, the
Cuisse Fruncaise de Developpement and other donors in improving Govemance.

VII. MANAGING
THE R I S K S
7.1
The realization of Djibouti’s poverv reduction strategy, and the effectiveness of this
CAS which is aligned to it, are subject to several external and internal risks. The PRSP
recognized upfront most o f these risks.
7.2
Djibouti’s exposure to external risk i s high because its economy depends mainly on the
port and its development; the rental of militaly bases; and grants and soft financing from
donors-all of which are subject to high geo-political uncertainties. Regarding the port, the
surge in growth since the mid-1990s o f port activities with Ethiopia was attributable to the
Ethiopifiritrea war, and subsequent reliance o f Ethiopia on the Djibouti port for most o f i t s
imports and exports. To limit the r i s k o f the reversibility o f the increase in i t s share in Ethiopia

trade traffic, Djibouti needs to improve the overall competitiveness o f the port by reducing costs,
and improving infrastructure links (road and railways) to Ethiopia. In this respect, the on-going
effort to expand transport infrastructure with direct financial participation o f the Ethiopian side
raises the stakes of the latter in maintaining continuous business and limits this risk. As for the
prospective development and expansion o f port as a transshipment hub, it i s s t i l l awaiting the
conclusion o f a deal with a foreign private investor. The rental o f the newest military bases (the
U S and Germany bases) which constitutes an important additional source o f revenue to the
Government and influences the development o f many service activities, i s also subject to
unpredictability, even though more in the longer term than in the near term, given the continuing
regional instability in the Middle East.

25

7.3
The financing of the PRSP investment program hinges on important contributions
from donors in the form of grants, which, if not forthcoming in the amounts envisaged, could
jeopardize fiscal sustainability and/or the PRSP investment program. This risk and its effects
will be hopefully adequately addressed by Djibouti’s partners during the planned Consultative
Group Meeting in support o f the PRSP. Djibouti would mitigate this risk significantly by
addressing i t s structural adjustment reform to boost confidence o f its partners in the effectiveness
o f their support and foreign investors on the competitiveness and long term economic, social and
political stability o f the country.
7.4

CAS implementation is also subject to two major internal risks. First, there is the risk

that the Government may move too slowly or not at all with respect to the next phase offiscal
consolidation and restructuring. Failing to take these decisions and implementing such reforms
would shed more uncertainty o n the attainment o f the PRSP objectives in terms o f basic service
delivery and better income and rent distribution. It would also delay the necessary adjustments

needed to improve competitiveness and thus deter potential FDI, and diminish donor support.
The envisaged high-case scenario lending (FCC 11) would provide, along with expected larger
support from Djibouti’s other partners, both technical and financial assistance to help wither
down the social costs o f this reform, and enhance i t s social and political feasibility.

7.5

The other source of internal risk is related to the capacity to implement and monitor
Djibouti’s poverty reduction strategy, which implies a large increase in the public investment
program in a situation of relatively low skill levels and limited administrative and management
capacity. The risk i s not significant with regard to the implementation o f the C A S program
However, the institutional capacity constraints can potentially limit the
(section V).
Government’s ability to utilize fully and effectively increased support from other donors. IDA
will keep this broader issue under review.
