E X ECU T I V E SUMMARY 

i. 

The Central African Republic (CAR) i s one o f the poorest countries in Sub-Saharan 
Africa. Fo l low ing presidential and legislative elections in 2005, CAR ’s po l i t ica l situation has 
improved. Po l i t ica l reconc i l ia t ion launched in early 2008, inc lud ing a ceasefire agreement with 
the ma in r e b e l group and a peace accord be tween the Government and the opposition parties have 
been concluded successfully. This led t o the Inc lus ive Po l i t ica l D ia logue (IPD), wh ich includes 
forma t ion o f a Government o f Na t iona l Unity; revised status o f po l i t ica l parties, and the 
separation o f powers. The IPD , wh ich also aims to ensure transparent and fa i r na t iona l elections 
in 20 10, and implementation o f decentralization, shows early promise, but i t s implementation 
remains unfinished. Overall, na t iona l reconc i l ia t ion i s progressing, while the security situation 
remains fragile. 

ii. 

Sustained progress will be needed to bring about lasting peace and economic 
recovery. CAR ’S challenges are magn i f ied by the impacts o f the g loba l economic crisis on the 
country’s g row th and on tax and export revenues. C A R has nevertheless shown i t s commitment 
to sustaining a good macroeconomic program, governance reform, and service de l ivery 
improvements. The Government reached the H IPC Dec is ion Po in t in 2007 and i s on track to 
reach H IPC Comp le t ion in m id-2009 . Hence, the country’s prospects are good fo r achieving 
development resu l ts and imp rov ing the qua l i ty o f l i f e o f CAR ’s citizens, bu t continued re fo rm 
and support f rom the international commun i ty i s necessary to ensure s tab i l i ty . 

iii. CAR’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), covering the period 2008-2010, 
was validated by development partners at the Brussels Round Table in October 2007. The 
PRSP continues to constitute the reference document fo r programm ing external support. I t 
consists o f four strategic p i l lars : 
P i l la r 1 : Restore security, re in force peace e f for ts and prevent con f l ic t ; 
P i l la r 2: Promote good governance and the ru le o f law; 
P i l la r 3 : Rebuild and d ive rs i fy the economy; and 
P i l la r 4: Deve lop human resources. 

iv . 
The Country Re-Engagement Note o f mid-2004 marked the re-establishment o f the 
World Bank Group’s relationship with CAR, fo l low ing a pe r iod o f suspension due to CAR ’s 
extended ins tab i l i ty and accumulation o f unsustainable arrears. The C R N remained in e f fec t until 
i t was superseded by a Joint A f r ican Development BanWWor ld Bank Interim Strategy No te 
(JISN) fo r FY2007-2008. The J ISN sought to harmonize support f rom CAR ’S key development 
partners, and to demonstrate their shared resolve to (a) address the country’s aggravated arrears 
problem; (b) facilitate access to the H i g h l y Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) in i t ia t ive and the 
Mu l t i la te ra l Debt R e l i e f In i t ia t ive (MDRI); (c) support Government efforts to p rov ide basic 
services; and (d) re in force Government ac t ion to stabilize the social and po l i t ica l environment. 

v i i 

v. 
Many o f the activities launched under the J I S N are still in progress. The total 
committed World Bank portfolio o f US$76 million and AfDB portfolio o f U A 41.8 million 
(US$62.6 million) provide targeted support to economic governance, capacity development, and 
basic service delivery. Despite huge capacity constraints and an unfinished peace-building 
process, the efforts undertaken jointly by the two banks are beginning to produce tangible results. 
Going forward, the concessional funding limitations under IDA and ADF respectively highlight 
the need for innovative approaches and instruments including t r u s t funds, vertical funds, and 
other resources promoting regional integration. Total current and potential financing from the 
WBG for the CPS period i s estimated at US$18 1 million. 

vi. 
This Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), prepared jointly by the World Bank 
Group (WBG) and the African Development Bank (AfDB), lays out the strategy and planned 
lending and non-lending support from the two institutions to CAR for the FY09-12 period (July 
2008-June 2012). For the first time, the CPS integrates the International Finance Corporation 
(IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) into the partnership. The CPS 
builds on results achieved under the JISN, and sustains and deepens support provided through 
current programs. The CPS provides support to PRSP P i l la rs 2 (governance) and 3 
(diversification), with limited WBG support to PRSP Pillar 4 (human development). Analytical 
and advisory work by the two institutions w i l l target priority sectors and topics where information 
gaps hamper sound policy making and appropriate donor responses. The CPS sends a c lear 
message that, following i t s protracted absence, the in terna t iona l community i s ready to sustain 
support to CAR’S efforts to achieve sustainable development resu l ts . 

vii. 
The CPS i s selective based upon CAR’S priority needs, the comparative advantages o f 
both banks, and harmonizatiodcoordination with other donors. Coordination i s particularly 
critical with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and other partners with specific 
mandates in the areas o f peace and security. The CPS also optimizes the joint response through 
increased‘WBG presence on the ground. 

0 

v i i i . By the end o f the CPS period, the following outcomes are expected: 
PRSP Pillars 2 and 3, with WBG and AfDB support: 
Improved public f inance management, revenue mobilization and governance; 
Improved transparency and accountability in natural resource management; 
Improved investment climate and opportunities for private sector-led growth; 
0 Strengthened economic infrastructure; 
Improved access to basic urban and lo ca l community infrastructure; and 
Increased agricultural productivity and commercialization. 

0 

0 

0 

Pillar 4, with limited WBG support: 
Improved access to and quality o f education and health services. 
ix. 
CPS implementation i s susceptible to five broad r i s k s : 
0 TheJirst i s a risk o f sporadic violence in the north and center o f the country. I n addition, 
CAR’S landlocked position in an unstable sub-region makes the country susceptible to 
destabilizing influences from the cross-border movement o f armed rebel groups. 

v i i i 

A second risk stems from CAR’S exposure to shocks and its vulnerability to negative 
impacts on its current account, reserves, revenue, and growth. The global economic cr is is , 
combined with other external shocks and security issues , has had a negative impact on these 
variables. 
T h i r d i s a risk associated with popular expectations o f the Inclusive Political Dialogue 
(IPD) launched in 2008, which promises a r e t u r n to peace, stability and a better quality o f 
l i f e . CAR’S state institutions, including the police and judiciary, remain fragile and 
underdeveloped. Widespread unemployment, and the perception that the early peace has no t 
yet yielded tangible benefits, poses a risk to stability. 
A four th risk i s that the legacy o f corruption and abuse o f power may continue to thwart 
effective policy implementation and Government’s ability to regain the population’s t r u s t . 
F i f t h i s the risk o f Government’s weak capacity to implement reforms. 

x. 
I n recogn it ion o f these risks, the CPS p rov ides suppo r t and incentives f o r CAR to 
persist with r e f o rm efforts . I t also provides for c lose monitoring o f the macroeconomic situation 
by both banks in collaboration with t h e International Monetary Fund. I n addition, the CPS 
provides fo r projects targeting community development and service delivery improvements, to 
help mitigate risks o f instability. The IFC and MIGA w i l l explore employment creation through 
expansion o f private sector development opportunities. Projects w i l l be designed using emerging 
good practice from the World Bank’s Governance and Anti-Corruption (GAC) Initiative in order 
to offset corruption risks, monitor achievement o f resu l ts , and strengthen local implementation 
capacity. Should the macro-economic situation change in the course o f CPS implementation, the 
WBG would also re-consider the balance between investment lending and development policy 
lending.

Transition to Peace and Stability in CAR 

A View from Kaga-Bandoro’ 

Kaga-Bandoro, population 68,000, stretches along the busy road 200 miles north of Bangui. I t is 
beginning its rebirth as a vibrant prefecture. Waves of violent conjlict had devastated Kaga- 
Bandoro since c iv i l war broke out in 2002. When humanitarian organizations arrived there in 
2007, more than 22 percent of 
the population had been suffering f r om long periods of 
displacement and insecurity. As the local f ie ld coordinator of the International Rescue Committee 
(IRC) described the situation, “More than 28,000 people, who had been forced to live ‘hunting 
and hiding’ in the bushes for about two years, were slowly starting to resettle along the road. 

Today, Kaga-Bandoro has drinking water holes, primary and vocational schools, a community 
center, pharmacies, a Gender-Based Violence (GB v ) Group, and a functioning hospital 
providing pediatric care to thousands of children. More than a dozen international NGOs are 
now shifting their support f r om emergency to durable solutions. Their work continues to be 
d i f icu l t due to the population ’s persistent lack of 
trust in the authorities. 

As security begins to return to CAR’S villages, development interventions are helping to rebuild 
trust and foster community development. I n Kaga-Bandoro today, children talk about their future 
and women are f ind ing ways to increase their household income. Organizations such as the GB V 
Center are ensuring that victims of sexual violence have access to psychological support and 
training to help them generate income. Primary school enrollment is increasing and community 
teachers are being recruited. 

Ma r ie , a refugee f r om the Democratic Republic of Congo, explains how the skills acquired at the 
GBV Center helped her regain confidence in herself and start a sm a l l business. Evelyne, a victim 
of domestic violence, describes the change in family dynamics when she transferred her newly 
acquired soap-making skills to her husband “He is now producing soap while I cultivate 
vegetables, ” says Evelyne. “He is no longer violent w i th me or the children and I am able to talk 
to him about things. ” 

The ranks of children attending community schools are swelling rapidly, but teacher availability 
remains limited. The community school at Patcho in Kaga-Bandoro prefecture is bursting w i th 
236 pupils served by 3 community teachers. Children ’s enthusiasm, however, is insuppressible: 
“I want to be a pilot, I’ says Sylvain; “I want to be a doctor to help the family, ” says Vincent; 
and many others follow the chorus. 

Kaga-Bandoro is a telling example of many villages in the northern pa r t of Central African 
Republic. Afer years of displacement, people are slowly returning to normalcy. Community 
projects, youth empowerment, and gender-based initiatives supported by 
international 
organizations are producing results.

I. COUNTRY CONTEXT AND RECENT D E V E L O P M E N T S 

A. Country and Political Context 

1. 
CAR i s a country o f some four million people and i s endowed with rich forest and 
mineral resources and geographically located at the cross-roads o f Sub-Saharan Africa. 
Approximately 20 percent o f the population lives in Bangui, the capital city. The country i s 
also at the cross-roads o f transition from extended instability to a new phase o f peace and 
nation-building and economic recovery, f o r which sustained support from the international 
community i s required. C AR ’ S wea l th in natural resources be l ies the fac t that C A R remains one 
o f the least developed countries in the wo r ld (ranking 178th out o f 179 on the 2008 Human 
Development Index), in part due to i t s landlocked position, weak institutions, poor transportation 
system, unsk i l led wo rk force, and po l i t ica l and military crises. The coun try was an a id orphan up 
to 2006, when a spike in donor support was used to c lea r CAR ’S arrears t o the W o r l d Bank and 
the A D B . Ove ra l l donor f lows have increased since 2006, but the vo lume o f external assistance 
remains largely insu f f ic ien t to support the country’s e f for ts to ma in ta in s tab i l i ty and attain many 
o f the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). 

2. 
CAR’S political and security situation remains fragile, exacerbated by the insufficient 
presence o f central authority in some parts o f the territory. The coun try has endured years o f 
po l i t i ca l ins tab i l i ty and episodic low- in tens i ty con f l ic t , a l l o f wh ich have led to the destruction o f 
much o f i t s infrastructure and social fabric. 
In M a r c h 2003, the coun try underwent a regime 
change and the establishment o f a transitional government, wh ich successfully he ld national 
elections in 2005 resulting in the free election o f the incumbent President and his allies. 

3. 
Central to the Government’s vision i s the consolidation o f peace through dialogue and 
rebuilding o f trust. Peace talks resulted in a peace agreement with the key r e b e l groups: the 
Front de‘mocratique du peuple centrafricain (FDPC) and the Union des forces dbmocratiques 
pour l e rassemblement (UFDR) in 2007, and the Arme‘e populaire pour l a restauration de la 
rbpublique et l a de‘mocratie (APRD) in mid-2008. The peace process led to the ho ld ing o f an 
Inclusive Po l i t ica l D ia logue (IPD) in December 2008 wh ich invo lved the ruling party, a l l 
opposition parties, rebe l groups, c i v i l society, and ma jor re l ig ious groups. The I P D led to 
agreements t o fo rm a Government o f Na t iona l Unity, r e v i s e the status o f po l i t ica l parties and the 
separation o f powers, h o l d transparent and fa ir na t iona l elections in 20 10, and implement 
decentralization, inc lud ing mun ic ipa l and regional elections. The Na t iona l Unity Government, 
headed by the incumbent president, was formed in January 2009, but the short-term security 
situation remains uncertain because o f sporadic violence, especially in the no r th and northeast. 
Some rebel movements (the Front dbmocratique du peuple centrafiicain (FDPC) and the 
Mouvement de libbration centrafricaine pour l a justice (MLCJ)) accuse the Government o f 
m ishand l ing the disarmament and reintegration process by w i thho ld ing f inanc ia l assistance fo r 
their former combatants, and threaten to end the peace process. In this context, the UN Peace- 
Bu i ld ing Comm iss ion (PBC) adopted a Strategic Framework 2009-20 1 1 fo r C A R in M a y 2009 to 
focus on security sector reform, governance and the r u l e o f law, and support to development 
hubs. The prospects fo r lasting po l i t ica l s tab i l i ty w i l l depend on h ow fa i th fu l ly the IPD 
recommendations and the UN PBC’s Strategic Framework are implemented and, in particular, on 
the successful organization o f presidential and parliamentary elections in 201 0.

B. Economic Context and Outlook 

4. 
CAR ’S economy i s dominated by the primary sector, which accounted for 52.2 percent 
o f GDP in 2008, followed by the tertiary sector (30.5 percent) and the secondary sector (12.1 
percent). Subsistence agriculture (28.5 percent o f GDP) and l ives tock (12.5 percent o f GDP) are 
the m a i n ac t iv i t ies in the pr imary sector. Forestry, extractive industries (ma in ly diamonds), and 
export crops (coffee and cotton) contribute a smaller percentage o f GDP, although these sectors 
a re the ma in sources o f export revenue. 

5. 
S ince 2004, economic recovery has gained momentum as the country has begun to 
recover from the long period o f instability. Rea l GD P increased f r om -4.6 percent in 2003 to 
4.2 percent in 2007 du r ing a per iod wh ich was marked b y the implementation o f key reforms. 
Despite decreasing pub l ic investment, overa l l investment has increased, supported by pr iva te 
investment in the mining, forestry and telecommunications and transport sectors. Fore ign 
investment increased and regular payment o f pub l ic wages supported higher demand and 
consumption. Poor infrastructure, insecurity in ru ra l areas, lack o f adequate extension services, 
and dec l in ing performance o f cash crops (coffee and cotton) as a r e s u l t o f dec l in ing international 
prices and insecurity, have led to re la t ive ly l o w g row th in agriculture. 

6 . Over the course of 2008, CAR ’S economy has been affected by the changing 
international environment and a number o f shocks (breakdown at the ma in hydropower plant, 
with concomitant power outages; the increase in o i l and food prices; and appreciation o f the Eu ro 
against the U S dollar). The rea l GDP g row th rate was estimated at 2.2 percent in 2008 against 
pre- cr is is projections o f 4.9 percent. The g loba l economic s lowdown has negatively impacted 
C AR ’ S exports, which declined b y more than 20 percent in 2008 compared to 2007 (Box 1). 
Furthermore, weak external f inanc ing has led to a decline o f public investment, wh ich contributed 
to s low ing o f the pace o f grow th in 2008. 

7. 
Economic recovery i s likely to be gradual, with a projected 2.4 percent growth rate in 
2009 and average growth o f 4.0 percent over the CPS period (2009-2012). Such a scenario 
pre-supposes improved security; regular pub l ic wage payments to sustain in terna l demand and 
social stability; and greater investment (wh ich i s projected to r i s e f rom 10.2 percent o f GDP in 
2008 t o 14.2 percent by 2012) in electricity, roads, telecommunications, and other areas c r i t ica l 
fo r grow th . This scenario also pre-supposes: (a) decisive domestic reforms, inc lud ing governance 
reforms in the mining and forestry sectors; (b) improvements in the business climate, inc lud ing 
increases in credit to the pr iva te sector; and (c) employment gains in the indus tr ia l and service 
sectors. 

8. 
CAR has had a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) program over 2007- 
2009 with the IMF, which has remained on track. The fourth review o f the PRGF was 
conducted in April 2009 and discussed by the Board o f the IMF in June 2009. Sound 
macroeconomic po l ic y has improved CAR ’S performance in mee t ing the reg iona l economic 
convergence cr i ter ia se t by the Central A f r ican Econom ic and Mone tary Commun i ty (CEMAC) . 
The reg iona l monetary arrangements and monetary po l icy o f the reg iona l central bank, B E A C 
(Banque des e‘tats de 1 ’Afrique centrule), have kept average in f la t ion be low CEMAC ’ s economic 
convergence cr i ter ion be tween 2004 and 2007. However, the compound effect o f higher food and 
o i l prices in the first semester o f 2008 led to temporar i ly higher in f la t ion in 2008, estimated at 

2 

9.3 percent. I n f l a t i o n i s p ro jec ted t o f a l l under the C E M A C c r i t e r i o n o v e r the CPS p e r i o d . 

Box 1: Impact o f the international financial c r i s i s on CAR 

The main impact o f transmission o f the international financial c r is is has been the weakening o f world demand and 
prices o f commodities, which led to a decline in economic activity especially i n the forestry and mining sector which 
account for approximately 82 percent o f exports. 

Forestry sector: I n 2008, timber exports f e l l by 24.1 percent compared to 2007 and by 36.8 percent compared to pre- 
crisis projections. Six out o f 9 timber companies closed their wood processing units, resulting in the layo f f o f 1335 
employees and a decrease o f 28 percent o f the wage b i l l i n this sector, which i s one o f the few formal industrial 
activities o f the country. T h e share o f the forestry sector i n GDP dropped by 1.9 points between 2007 and 2008. The 
downward trend o f timber demand i s expected to continue in 2009, according to the International Tropical Timber 
Organization (ITTO). 

Mining sector: Diamond exports i n 2008 f e l l by 25.5 percent compared to 2007 and by 38 percent compared to pre- 
c r i s i s projections. Taxes collected from diamond exports dropped by 18 percent between June 2007 and June 2008. 
Several small scale mining s i t e s have stopped their activities while the large mining companies have started to cut 
down on their investment and production programs. 

Exfernal accounts: Export o f goods has declined by 23 percent i n 2008 against pre-crisis projections o f 17.6 percent 
increase, and a r e projected to decline fitrther (-17 percent) i n 2009. This situation has resulted i n an increase o f the 
current account deficit (including transfers) from -6.1 percent o f GDP i n 2007 to -9.9 percent i n 2008. 

Pub l ic revenues: Compared to pre-crisis projections, revenues losses amounted to 23.6 percent o f exports taxes and 
3.7% o f fiscal revenues in 2008. Public expenditures should increase to meet the investments and f i s c a l stimulus 
measures needed to support economic recovery and mitigate the impact o f the c r is is on t h e forestry sector. This w i l l 
lead to deficit o f the domestic primary balance i n 2009. 

Economic growth: The global f inanc ia l c r i s i s has weakened growth to 2.2 percent in 2008 and 2.4 percent i n 2009 
against 4.2 percent in 2007 and pre-crisis projections o f 4.9 percent for 2008 and 5 percent fo r 2009. 

9. 
Fiscal policies have been marked by improved domestic revenue mobilization and 
efficient fiscal consolidation over the recent past (Figure 1). T h e domes t ic p r im a r y balance

A substantial increase in tax revenues will therefore be critical fo r meeting CAR ’S key 
fiscal obligations, which include: 

the high share of public wages in the budget. Public sa la r ies and wages represent nearly 
50 percent o f the recurrent budget, and constraints in the Government’s ability to meet 
these expenses could be a source o f soc ia l tension and instability.2 So far, with support 
from donors, CAR has succeeded in paying sa lar ies on a regular basis. The Government i s 
also undertaking ambitious medium-term reforms aimed at addressing the burden o f public 
wages on the budget while ensuring the quality o f public service delivery. To t h i s end, the 
Government has adopted a new organic framework for public administration, and a 
revised civil s e r v i c e statute including new remuneration and performance evaluation 
systems. 
the s ign i jkan t amount of domestic arrears and debt to commercial banks. Domestic 
public debt, including salary and pension arrears, debt to suppliers accumulated mostly 
during the period o f conflict (1998 -2003 ) , and debt to commercial banks, represents 22 
percent o f the 2008 GDP. The Government adopted a settlement plan in November 2008 , 
but lacks the resources to fu l f i l l the settlement arrangements. 
external debt service. Even a f te r the H IPC Completion Point i s reached around end-June 
2009 , external debt service obligations (Table 1) w i l l s t i l l represent a significant source o f 
outflows. 

’ For instance, a delay in the payment o f public salaries in December 2007 led to demonstrations and a 
public sector strike, and eventually to a Government re-shuffle in January 2008.

1 1. CAR ’S external position reflects the country’s vulnerability and dependence on 

foreign aid (Annex 3). The current account balance i s structurally in de f ic i t as a resu l t o f 
s ign i f ican t impo r t constraints, and concentration o f exports on p r ima ry commodities, wh ich 
leaves i t vulnerable to the t e rm s o f trade movement. F o l l ow i n g the f inanc ia l crisis, the current 
account deficit, inc lud ing pub l ic transfers deteriorated f r om 6.1 percent o f GDP in 2007 to 9.9 
percent in 2008. I t i s projected to remain at the same leve l until 2012. The de f ic i t on the services 
account i s also forecast t o remain high, as a resu l t o f import-related services and high transport 
costs, and the income account wou ld rema in in de f ic i t due to in te res t payments on the external 
debt. Projected international rese rve fluctuations during the CPS per iod r e f l e c t such vu lnerab i l i ty , 
with an average o f 3 months o f imports, down f rom 3.5 months in 2008. 

12. Full delivery o f H IPC and MDRI would allow much faster up-front reduction o f debt 

ratios. A L o w Income Coun try Debt Sustainability Ana lys is (L IC DSA) per formed in M a y 2009 
(Annex 2) shows that, fo l low ing attainment o f H IPC Comp le t ion Point, a l l debt indicators are 
projected t o remain be low the relevant thresholds throughout the pro jec t ion per ioda3 These ratios 
are projected to gradually decline over time, assuming that the ma in risks are con tro l led through a 
prudent f isca l stance, stabilizations measures, and new bo r row ing on concessional t e rm s . I t w i l l 
remain important fo r C A R to ma in ta in a stable soc io-po l i t ica l environment, in add i t ion to sound 
po l ic ies to support improvement in economic performance. 

C . P o v e r t y P r o f i l e 

13. CAR still has one o f the highest poverty rates in Sub-Saharan Africa, despite its 
considerable economic potential. Household survey data, collected with the support o f the 

UNDP , indicate that 67.2 percent o f the popu la t ion l ived be low the pover ty l i n e in 2003.4 Pover ty 
was higher, at 71.7 percent, in ru ra l areas, wh ich accounted fo r 62 percent o f the population; and 
in regions that had suffered f rom armed con f l ic t . I t was lowest in the capital, wh ich had the basic 
social infrastructure and highest economic ac t iv i ty . Accord ing to the Participatory Pover ty

The scenario assumes that CAR reached the Completion Point in June 2009. 
This i s based on a monetary definition o f poverty, where the national poverty l i n e i s equal to 
CFAF156.079 (US$3 12) per year per adult equivalent.

Ana lys is (2007),5 i t s three ma in causes are (a) poor governance, with the ma in comp la in t be ing 
abuse o f power b y s ta te o f f ic ia ls ; (b) insecurity and lack o f economic opportunities connected to 
recen t conflicts,6 wh ich have led to the pro l i fera t ion o f urban band i try and ex tor t ion at road 
blocks, even in areas no t d irec t ly affected by v io len t con f l ic t ; and (c) l o w incomes. 

14. Promotion o f sustainable human development i s one o f the four pillars o f the PRSP, 
but the country lacks the means to adequately implement policies and achieve the goals 
envisaged in the areas o f health and education. Recurrent con f l ic ts have led to a deterioration 
o f a l l social indicators, mak ing i t un l ike ly that C A R w i l l achieve most o f the Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs) by 201 5. C A R ranks 178th ou t o f 179 countries on the 2008 Human 
Development Index (HDI). This rank ing c lear ly illustrates the d i f f i c u l t l i v i n g conditions o f the 
popu la t ion and the l o w access to basic social services. Approx ima te ly 86 percent o f the 
popu la t ion has no access to health services, and 4 1 percent o f adults are i l l i tera te . L i f e expectancy 
at b i r th i s estimated at about 45 years, about ten years lowe r than the A f r ican average; and 
H I V / A I D S prevalence, wh ich was 6.2 percent in 2006 for persons 15 to 49 years o f age, i s the 
highest in the C EM A C zone. Policies to prevent and treat H I V / A ID S , tuberculosis, and ma lar ia 
are in place, bu t the mechanisms fo r fund ing and implementation rema in inadequate. 

15. Human development and poverty in CAR have been negatively affected by political 
instability. The humanitarian situation in some parts o f the country remains d i f f icu l t , and more 
than one m i l l i o n persons have been affected by violence.' Thousands were displaced in 2008, 
adding to the already 295,000 in terna l ly displaced persons and 100,000 C A R re fugees l i v i n g in 
Chad, Sudan, and Cameroon. Mos t have sought refuge in urban centers or in ru ra l areas in the 
south, and as a result have been cu t o f f f rom their sources o f l ive l ihood . Food insecurity and 
chronic ma lnu t r i t ion are con t inu ing problems, especially in the north, due to l o w agr icu l tura l 
p roduc t iv i ty and poor access to health services and clean water. 

16. CAR occupies the 153'd position out o f 177 countries on the UN Gender Development 
Index. There are substantial disparities be tween girls and boys in access to education and l i teracy 
leve ls . The ra t io o f boys t o girls i s 65 percent in p r ima ry and secondary schools, and 67 percent 
fo r literate you th be tween 15 and 24 years o f age. Access to prenatal and ch i ldb ir th-re la ted care, 
and to fam i ly p lann ing services, i s limited. The propor t ion o f births attended by sk i l led health 
personnel i s about 44 percent, while the maternal mo r ta l i ty rate i s estimated at 1,100 per 100,000 
births. Women rarely occupy positions o f authority in resource management or po l i t ica l l i f e , at 
either the loca l or na t iona l leve l . Women h o l d about 11 percent o f seats in the na t iona l assembly, 
and out o f 32 members o f Government, on ly four are women. In M a r c h 1992, C A R ra t i f ied the 
In terna t iona l Convention on the E l im ina t ion o f A l l Forms o f D isc r im ina t ion against Women, and 
in December 2004 the Cons t i tu t ion adopted guarantees o f gender equality. I t i s also a cross- 
cu t t ing objective o f the 2008-20 10 PRSP. 

The qualitative Participatory Poverty Analysis (PPA), undertaken in early 2007, aimed to capture public 
perceptions o f poverty. 
Years o f conflict have displaced a large proportion o f the rura l population and destroyed important 
economic and social infrastructure.

11. S T R U C T U R A L AND SECTORAL DEVELOPMENT AND CHALLENGES 

, A. CAR’S M a i n Strengths and Weaknesses 

17. C AR ’ S considerable economic po ten t ia l includes: (i) diverse na tura l resources, with an 
extended surface o f exploitable forest; (ii) favorable conditions fo r agr icu l tura l production; and 
(iii) extensive m inera l potential, inc lud ing diamonds, gold, uranium, i r o n and copper. These 
resources cou ld constitute a so l id basis fo r d ivers i f ica t ion and wea l th creation, i f managed in an 
equitable and transparent way. Since the re-engagement o f the AfDB and the W o r l d Bank in 
2006, the Government has demonstrated i t s willingness to imp lemen t the structural reforms that 
w i l l contribute to be t ter management o f these resources. 

18. The roo t causes o f s low economic and social progress in C A R inc lude i t s geographically 
landlocked loca t ion in an unstable sub-region, and i t s weak ins t i tu t ions with respect t o political, 
economic and social governance. Key challenges, iden t i f ied in the PRSP 2008-2010, are: (i) 
insecurity and weak social cohesion; (ii) weakness o f the State’s a dm i n i s t r a t i v e capac i ty and 
p o l i t i c a l and econom ic governance ; (iii) a p r o d u c t i o n sys tem b a d l y damaged by c o n f l i c t ; 
(iv) p o o r d i v e r s i f i c a t i o n o f the economy ; and (v) i n s u f f i c i e n t supply and l o w q u a l i t y o f 
bas ic soc io -econom ic in f ras t ru c tu re . 

B. Governance, Co r rup t ion and Public Sector Management 

19. Governance indicators. CAR’S governance indicators are lower than the average f o r 
Sub-Saharan Africa, as con f irmed by: (a) the W o r l d Bank and EU-led Pub l ic Expenditure and 
F inanc ia l Accoun tab i l i ty Assessment (PEFA); (b) the W o r l d Bank - led Coun try F inanc ia l 
Accoun tab i l i ty Assessment (CFAA) , the Treasury A u d i t report; and (c) U N D P and Transparency 
In terna t iona l reports on C AR ’ S anti-corruption progress. Desp i te these weaknesses, C A R has 
made tangible progress in t e rm s o f pub l ic f inanc ia l management, na tura l resource management, 
procurement, the fight against corruption, and administrative reform. 

20. Corruption. CAR has strengthened the legal framework fo r fighting corruption and 
improved i t s Transparency In terna t iona l rank ing f rom 162 o f 180 countries in 2007 to 15 1 o f 180 
countries in 2008. C A R has also begun to adopt reforms requ ired under UN anti-corruption 
conventions. An An t i -Co r rup t ion Committee (ACC), 
inc lud ing representatives f rom the 
Government, c i v i l society, and the private sector was created in M a r c h 2008, and i s f ina l iz ing an 
an t i-corrup t ion strategy. In compliance with the Cons t i tu t ion and a Decree issued in M a r c h 2008, 
Government members and high rank ing o f f ic ia ls have declared their assets. An A c t i o n Plan to 
address fraud and corrup t ion in mining, forestry, and Treasury has uncovered more than 50 cases 
o f corrup t ion in Treasury and the Tax Directorate. The Government i s also engaged in a 
participatory analysis designed to improve compliance with UN conventions. 

21. Procurement. The Government has also introduced a new Procurement Code, and has 
established a Procurement Directorate and related regulatory bodies in the health, education, 
agriculture, and infrastructure ministries. I t has also adopted standard bidding documents and 
procedural manuals. An Ac t ion Plan has been adopted to improve procurement standards and 
prov ide a framework fo r donor support in the com ing years. 

7 

22. Public finance management. Tax revenue increases have been achieved through regular 
audits o f large enterprises; the in troduc t ion o f tax iden t i f ica t ion numbers and an integrated system 
fo r use by the customs and tax administrations; and ma jor reductions o f subsidies in the o i l sector. 
The Government i s currently adopting measures to curb tax exemptions. I t i s also strengthening 
the customs administration and imp lemen t ing reforms a imed at iden t i fy ing adequate transit 

regimes. 

23. The Government has made tangible progress towa rd res tor ing the integrity and c red ib i l i ty 
in pub l ic expenditure management. A Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) fo r health, 
education, infrastructure, and agriculture sectors i s be ing prepared fo r the 20 10 budget. 
Expenditure control, wh ich has been instrumental in ma in ta in ing f isca l stability, has been 
strengthened, inc lud ing restoration o f autonomy to the f inanc ia l con t ro l directorate, and 
supervision o f cash management by a Treasury committee headed by the President. F ina l ly , non- 
donor mandated commercial bank accounts have been closed t o achieve a treasury single account 
(TSA). Bas ic func t iona l processes, the regulatory framework, and organizational structures 
responsible fo r data capture have also been strengthened. Accoun t ing and repor t ing systems have 
been improved with the produc t ion o f quarterly budget execution reports fo r the f i r s t time in 
CAR , using comprehensive budget classifications already used fo r the 2008 budget and new 
accounting classifications. An automated expenditure record ing system (GESCO) at the l e v e l o f 
the Directorate o f Budget i s be ing ro l led out at t h e Treasury to integrate the mon i to r ing and 
repor t ing o f bo th systems. Lastly, the 2008 Government Accounts and Execu t ion L a w w i l l be 
presented to the Courts o f Accoun t and Parliament, respectively, in the second semester o f 2009. 

24. Natura l resource management. A recent mining sector review conducted by the W o r l d 
Bank in co l labora t ion with the AfDB con f irmed the need fo r re fo rm o f the regulatory framework 
in add i t ion to capacity strengthening across the sector. Previous mining regulations and l icens ing 
practices were found to be unfavorable to investors and to the country. Ins t i tu t iona l bottlenecks 
also reduced the effectiveness o f m in ing sector operations, leading to smuggling, marg ina l 
revenue gains fo r the Government and non-transparent mining practices. 

25. C A R became an o f f i c i a l member o f the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative 
(EITI) in November 2008, and published i t s f i r s t EITI repor t in M a r c h 2009. A new Forestry 
Code and a revised M i n i n g Code based on international bes t practices were adopted in October 
2008 and April 2009, respectively. Forestry taxes are now be ing used fo r commun i ty 
development schemes under the supervision o f an in ter-m in is ter ia l committee. Permanent and 
transparent communications have been introduced v i a newspaper and radio, 
to in fo rm 
communities about revenue accruing to them and revenue-sharing mechanisms. Las t ly , to ensure 
access fo r C AR ’ S timber products in to the EU, the country i s imp lemen t ing an A f r ica Forest L a w

logg ing and trade, as well as w i ld l i fe poaching. These in i t ia t ives are expected to enhance 
transparency and attract investment in CAR ’S natural resource sectors. 

26. Public administration reform. CAR ’S public service faces a huge deficit o f professional 
and technical competencies, resulting in large part from extended periods o f instability and 
human capital flight. F i f t y - two percent o f c i v i l servants a re over 45 years o f age, and the 
recurrent arrears in the Government wage b i l l provides l i t t l e incentive fo r qua l i f ied young Central 
A fr icans to take up a pub l ic service career. The Social Security Au tho r i ty (OCSS) has also 
accumulated a back log o f unpa id pension arrears. Since re-engagement in 2006, development 
partners have assisted the Government in restoring core functions, especially in economic 

8 

governance areas, but a comprehensive re fo rm o f the c i v i l service, inc lud ing improvement o f 
terms and conditions o f service and rehab i l i ta t ion o f basic infrastructure, remains a p r io r i ty . 

C. Private Sector Development 

27. Private sector-Zed growth. CAR ’S pr iva te sector i s sma l l by in terna t iona l standards. There 
are fewer than 25 large companies - defined loca l ly as those w i t h sales o f more than US$2 
m i l l ion . The pr iva te sector i s represented by two professional associations the Groupement 
Interprofessionnel de Centrafiique (G ICA ) fo r large companies and the Union Nationale du 
Patronat Centrafiicain (UNPC) fo r sma l l en terpr ises . Key issues hampering pr iva te sector 
development include: (a) l o w capacity o f SMEs (management, market access and access to 
credit); (b) weak business environment; (c) h i g h in terna l debt o f the Government t o the pr iva te 
sector; (d) tense business-government relations; and (e) unstable e lec tr ic i ty supply, wh ich 
increases the cost ‘ o f production. The business environment has improved ma rg ina l ly since 2006 
due t o the establishment o f a permanent framework fo r consultation be tween the Government and 
the pr iva te sector and the in troduc t ion o f a one-stop w indow fo r l icens ing (Guichet unique) and 
the reduc t ion f rom 4 months to 14 days o f the time needed to establish a company. However, 
entrepreneurship in C A R i s at an early stage o f development, and few new bus inesses have been 
established. Further, the few existing fore ign businesses have been s low to expand their 
operations due to unpred ic tab i l i ty in the lega l and regulatory framework govern ing the business 
environment. Pending pr iva te sector re forms include a strengthened regulatory framework, and 
measures to ensure greater transparency in the business environment. 

28, Competitiveness. Inadequate economic infrastructure and scarcity o f skilled labor are the 
ma in constraints to improved competitiveness. Mos t bus inesses are sma l l and in forma l , and s u f f e r 
f rom a chronic shortage o f electricity, frequent power outages, h igh transportation costs, and l o w 
produc t ion capacity. Con f l ic ts and weak investment in human capital have resulted in a dire 
shortage o f sk i l led labor. 

D. T rade and Regional Economic Integration 

29. C AR ’ S progress towards economic integration and access to external markets has been 
hampered no t on ly by extended periods o f ins tab i l i ty but also by weak transport infrastructure 
l ink ing C A R to neighboring countries. C A R i s ranked 172”d ou t o f 175 countries with respect to 
international trade, and i t s Freedom to Trade index i s 5 1.4 ou t o f 100 compared to 87.4 fo r the 
bes t per form ing country in A f r ica . Nevertheless, through CAR ’S membership in CEMAC , the 
country has demonstrated comm i tmen t t o economic cooperation and reg iona l integration 
in i t ia t ives . The Government undertook several actions in 2008 to promote trade and reg iona l 
integration, inc lud ing the harmonization o f CAR ’S Trade Code with reg iona l and international 
instruments. (As a member o f CEMAC , C A R applies a most-favored-nation tariff o f about 18 
percent; and four t a r i f f bands, with the highest being 30 percent, fo r consumer goods). The 
Government has also started to upgrade i t s customs infrastructure to fac i l i ta te the imp lemen ta t ion 
o f the C EM A C Customs Un ion . In coord ina t ion with i t s C EM A C neighbors, C A R i s negotiating 
an Economic Partnership Agreement with the EU. In addition, C A R i s a signatory to an OHADA 
(Organization for the Harmon iza t ion o f Business L a w in A fr ica) treaty wh ich seeks to 
mainstream a un i form , modernized, lega l framework fo r commercial activities in West and 
Central A fr ican countries which are part o f the c i v i l l aw trad i t ion . Under the t e rm s o f the treaty, 
C A R and 16 West and Central A f r ican countries have adopted eight reg iona l laws -- o r U n i f o rm 

9 

Ac ts - designed to improve company and contract laws, and arbitration. C A R i s also rece iv ing 
technical assistance f rom IFC ’s FIAS Investment C l ima te unit in an amb i t ious program o f lega l 
harmon iza t ion designed to improve registration, credit ava i lab i l i ty , inves tor protection, contract 
enforcement and business c los ing standards. 

E. Sustainable Development 

30. 
Infrastructure. The vast ma jo r i ty o f CAR ’S popu la t ion lacks access to even basic 
infrastructure, and l o w service levels are exacerbated by poor maintenance o f existing 
infrastructure. The road ne twork i s in extreme disrepair, and o f ten impassable during the ra iny 
season. Paved roads hard ly exist beyond the Bangui-Douala Co r r ido r (wh ich i s no t even 
completely paved). River transport (except fo r o i l products) i s marginal, as the Oubangui and 
Congo Rivers are navigable on ly fou r months a year. The net r e s u l t o f poor transport 
infrastructure i s that basic goods are considerably more expensive than in non-landlocked 
ne ighbor ing countries. There i s no sewerage network, and the absence o f latrines and poor 
drainage pose c r i t ica l health r isks , including diarrhea and malaria. U rban services such as so l id 
waste co l lec t ion were discontinued during the war and need t o be re-established. In fo rma t ion and 
communications technology needs are enormous. U rban infrastructure requ i res significant 
investment in response t o rap id urbanization as the ru ra l popu la t ion f l e e s lawlessness in ou t ly ing 
areas. This prob lem i s par t icu lar ly acute in Bangui. The challenges in ru ra l areas are likely to be 
even more enormous, although data on water supply, sanitation, cook ing fue l , electricity, 
telecommunications, and transportation are scarce and unreliable. 

3 1. M o r e than h a l f o f C AR ’ S terr i tory i s sparsely populated. Spatial dimensions therefore have 
an important bearing on economic development. Con f l ic t and v io lence resulting f rom the 
insu f f ic ien t presence o f government in many zones have resulted in s ign i f ican t displacement, 
inc lud ing rap id and hazardous urbanization, especially t o Bangu i where economic ac t iv i ty i s 
concentrated. Secondary c i t ies remain re la t ive ly small, but have the po ten t ia l to become g row th 
poles. W h i l e such concentrations o f economic ac t iv i ty are desirable fo r economic growth, the 
accompanying spatial disparities in welfare levels wh ich accompany the concentration are no t . A 
three-year European Comm iss ion program i s centered on a development poles approach in 
secondary cities. The strategy, lending and non-lending support, la id out in the CPS complements 
the EU approach by focusing bo th on Bangu i as CAR ’S ma in economic engine, and on poverty 
reduction o f vulnerable groups in ru ra l areas. 

32. Energy. Energy infrastructure i s par t icu lar ly dilapidated, and power outages are frequent. 
L e s s than one percent o f Central A fr icans i s connected t o the grid o f the national e lec tr ic i ty 
utility, ENERCA . Ins ta l led e lec tr ic i ty capacity includes: (a) tw o hydropower plants (Boa l i 1 and 
B o a l i 2) with firm capacity o f 14.9 megawatts; (b) a hydroelectric and regu la t ion dam (Boa l i 3) 
wh ich i s no t yet equipped with i t s 10 MW turbines, and operation o f wh ich has been pending 
donor support fo r many years; (c) a thermal power p lan t in Bangu i equipped with 6 diesel 
generators, 5 o f wh ich are no t operational; (d) two transmission l i n e s connecting B o a l i 1 and 
B o a l i 2 to Bangui; and (e) a d is tr ibu t ion network. The f t o f an t i -p i l fe r ing devices, especially for 
lighting, and outdated lines severely limit transmission capacity. The d is tr ibu t ion system i s also 
outdated, with losses estimated at 45 to 5 0 percent o f e lec tr ic i ty distributed. In 2008, e lec tr ic i ty 
shortages led to an acute crisis, resulting in the breakdown o f the B o a l i 2 hydroelectric station 
supplying Bangui. In add i t ion to power shortages and high energy losses, EN ERC A s u f f e r s f rom 

10 

l o w co l lec t ion rates, resulting in a d isma l f inanc ia l performance. F r om the reg iona l energy 
perspective, C A R i s a member o f the Central A f r ica Power Pool, and an interconnection pro toco l 
has been signed be tween the Democratic Repub l ic o f Congo and CAR . P r io r i ty interconnection 
investments fo r the sub-region w i l l be evaluated in the context o f a reg iona l interconnection 
master p lan wh ich i s curren t ly under development. 

33. Overall, infrastructure needs far outweigh available funds and implementation 
’ capacity. 
The Government w i l l have to meet these daunting challenges through reg iona l 
collaborative approaches that can lower costs, especially fo r the transport, energy and 
telecommunications sectors. Trade-offs w i l l need to be made be tween service leve ls and service 
coverage. P rov id ing basic infrastructure services in a transparent and equitable manner w i l l help 
t o re-establish c red ib i l i ty and t r u s t in the Government. N e w infrastructure development and 
rehab i l i ta t ion o f existing infrastructure assets w i l l have t o be combined with improvements t o the 
institutional, financial, and human capacity required to operate and ma in ta in systems. This w i l l 
inc lude commun i ty management in ru ra l and peri-urban areas as well as more fo rma l 
arrangements, combined with cost recovery, especially fo r higher service levels such as 
household connections. 

34. Agriculture, livestock and rura l development. C A R enjoys generous water supply and a 

diversified ecosystem, but on ly 4.4 percent o f arable land i s exploited. Some 67.2 percent o f 
Central A fr icans live be low the poverty l ine , ma in ly because o f l o w agr icu l tura l p roduc t iv i ty and 
lack o f access to and f rom insecure areas, especially in the no r th o f the country. Ag r icu l tu ra l 
g row th has stagnated be low the popu la t ion g row th rate since the 1980s. The PRSP outlines t h e 
core needs fo r rev i ta l iz ing the agriculture sector: (a) develop the capacity o f ru ra l people and 
organizations; (b) rebuild the capacity o f the Ministry o f Ru ra l Development and related sector 
institutions; (c) in tens i fy and diversify agr icu l tura l output; and (d) rehabilitate ru ra l infrastructure. 

35. C A R i s far f rom s e l f - s u f f i c i e n t in food, even though food crops (cassava, peanuts, corn, 
millet and sorghum) occupy 75 percent o f cu l t iva ted land. The food crisis o f m id-2008 depressed 
food production. M o r e than 80 percent o f t h e ru ra l popu la t ion i s invo lved in livestock, but 
produc t ion system i s dominated by small-scale trad i t iona l practices. The Government’s Rura l 
Sector Development Strategy Paper (DSDSR) identifies fou r ma in challenges fo r the sector: (a) 
capacity building o f producers and their organizations; (b) in tens i f ica t ion and d ivers i f ica t ion o f 
agriculture production, forestry, f ish ing and hunting; (c) infrastructure improvements to support 
production, preservation, storage, processing and marketing; and (d) strengthening o f agriculture 
and forestry institutions. As par t o f this strategy, the Government also plans to undertake a 
“Surface A rea -Y ie ld Production” survey o f ma jor crops. C AR ’ S ab i l i ty to implement the strategy 
i s however severely undermined by insu f f ic ien t finance and l o w ins t i tu t iona l capacity. 

36. Environment and climate change. C A R l i e s across tw o ma jor c l ima t ic zones, the Sahelian 
t o the no r th and the equatorial to the south, bo th o f wh ich are su f fer ing the effects o f deteriorating 
environmental conditions. W h i l e the country i s endowed with abundant underground and surface 
water resources (estimated at 141 km3/yr and 56 km3/yr respectively), bo th water basins are 
experiencing: (a) a steady decline in vo lume f rom year t o year; and (b) deterioration o f surface 
water quality, especially f rom rivers, creeks, and trad i t iona l we l ls . The Government i s t ry ing to 
address the loom ing environment and climate i s s u e s wh ich threaten to accelerate desertification 
and a decrease in b iod ivers i ty . First, C A R has become a member o f the Forestry Comm iss ion o f 

11 

Central A f r i c a (COM IAF) , and has ra t i f ied the international conventions on c l ima te change. 
Second, a Na t iona l Env ironmen ta l A c t i o n P lan and the 2008 revised Forestry Code target 
improved management o f forestry and wildlife resources. The Forestry Code aims t o improve 
transparency and compe t i t ion in the award ing o f logg ing permits, in add i t ion to ensuring outreach 
to communities affected by the granting o f such permits. Unde r the Code, a share o f the forestry 
royalties and wildlife taxes w i l l be kept in a t r u s t account fo r forest development, commun i ty 
projects and tourism. 

F. Human Development 

37. Education. Education outcomes in C A R are currently among the lowes t in the sub-region. 
Resulting f rom extended instability, the education system suffered a loss o f teachers, destruction 
o f infrastructure, and l o w investment. In 1990/91, C A R ' S pr imary school gross enro l lmen t rate 
was 7 1 percent (1 0 percentage points above the average fo r French-speaking A f r ican countries), 
but by 20046 , that rate had increased to on ly 75 percent (10 percentage points be low these 
In 2007, one ch i ld out o f fou r had never attended school, and on ly 24 percent o f 
countries).' 
attending ch i ldren completed the p r ima ry leve l . The conditions o f instruction, as measured by 
students per teacher (1 1 1 : l), students per classroom (100: 1) and textbooks per student (1 : 10) are 
extremely poor by any standard. Pub l ic f inanc ing fo r education accounts fo r on ly 3.2 percent o f 
GDP, as against an average o f 4.7 percent in A f r ica . In an e f fo r t to reverse the dec l in ing trend in 
C AR ' S education outcomes, the Government has prepared a Na t iona l Educa t ion Strategy, wh ich 
prov ided the basis for successful app l ica t ion to the Education fo r A l l -Fas t Track In i t ia t ive 
Ca ta ly t ic Fund wh ich approved a grant o f U S $ 3 8 . 0 m i l l i o n to C A R in December 2008. 

3 8. Health. C AR ' S human development indicators are well be low the Sub-Saharan average, 
and health s e r v i c e fund ing and p rov is ion are very poor. Abou t 15 percent o f ch i ldren a re 
underweight at b i r th and 19 percent are severe ly stunted. L i f e expectancy i s 39 years. Ma terna l 
mo r ta l i ty was 1,355 per 100,000 in 2003', compared to 1,100 per 100,000 in 2000 lo, and 986 per 
100,000 in 199511. Positive developments inc lude a decline in the ch i ld mo r ta l i ty rate (0-5 years) 
to 176 per 1000 ch i ldren in 200612, f rom 220 per 1,000 in 200313. In the same period, in fan t 
mo r ta l i ty (0-1 years) f e l l f rom 132 to 106 per 1,000 infants. Immun iza t ion trends are improv ing , 
with 89.7 percent coverage fo r tuberculosis, 83.2 percen t fo r polio, 84.2 percent fo r diphtheria, 
and 99.7 percen t for ye l low fever in 2007. Under-funded and short-staffed pub l ic health 
ins t i tu t ions constrain service delivery. S ta f f concentration in Bangu i i s excessive, leav ing health 
posts and hospitals in the r e s t o f the country understaffed. E lec t r ic i ty shortages, and lack o f gas 
and spare parts fo r generators, hinder hosp i ta l operations. Hea l th centers p rov id ing preventive and 
basic curative care are run by autonomous commun i ty management committees on a cost- 
recovery basis, wh ich constitutes a barrier t o access fo r much o f the population. In the absence o f 
the State, faith-based and humanitarian organizations and international NGOs also prov ide 
substantial health services t o the ru ra l population. The PRSP aims to improve health indicators 
between 2008 and 2010, b y increasing access to health services, and reduce maternal mo r ta l i ty (to

Government strategies include the Na t iona l P lan fo r the Development o f Sanitation 2006-201 5 , 
the Na t iona l Strategic P lan to Reduce Malaria, and the Comprehensive and Extended Multi- 
Annua l Vacc ina t ion Program 2007-20 1 1 (PPAC). 

39. H IV /A IDS . C A R i s the tenth most H IV - in fec ted country in Sub-Saharan A f r ica . The 
Government has defined the H I V / A I D S epidemic as a na t iona l emergency, and in fec t ion rates are 
thought to be on the increase. UNAIDS estimates H IV prevalence in C A R at about 6.3 percent 
among persons be tween 15 and 49 years o f age, wh ich i s above the 3 t o 5 percent rates in 
ne ighbor ing countries. I-IIV/AIDS and related opportunistic in fec t ions are a substantial threat to 
the country’s economic and social development. The most active donors in support o f HIV/AIDS 
prevention and treatment are the G loba l Fund, German cooperation, France, and USAID. Go ing 
forward, an expansion o f H I V / A I D S counseling and testing w i l l be needed to slow the upward 
trend in in fec t ion rates. Imp roved b lood safety measures are also necessary, as i s better care o f 
patients with sexually transmitted diseases and tuberculosis. 

111. CAR’S DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES 

40. CAR presented its first full PRSP (2008-2010) to the Boards o f the World Bank and 
the IMF in December 2006. The PRSP (see B o x 2 be low) was also validated by a l l o f C AR ’ S 
development partners during a Roundtable held in B r u s s e l s in October 2007. The PRSP i s built 
on four pillars: (1) security, peace and con f l ic t prevention; (2) good governance and the r u l e o f 
law; (3) economic rev i ta l iza t ion and diversification; and (4) human development. Gender 
promo t ion and sound environmental management are cross-cutting issues o f the PRSP. 

Box 2: PRSP 2008-2010 Objectives, Pillars, and Expected Results 

V is ion : The Government’s vision, articulated in the Pover ty Reduc t ion Strategy, i s t o build a strong, 
united, and prosperous na t ion in con fo rm i ty w i t h the population’s aspirations fo r peace, security, and good

Results expected: (a) average annual g row th o f 9.5 percent du r ing the pe r iod 2008-2010; and (b) reduc t ion 
o f pover ty t o 56.6 percent by 2010. 

13 

41. The PRSP includes: (a) strong ownership and par t ic ipa tory process; (b) a u s e f u l pover ty 
diagnostic, wh ich drew upon a l l available data sources; (c) presentation o f sector pr ior i t ies and 
strategies; (d) presentation o f targets mapped to the MDGs; and (e) a high l e v e l o f pub l ic 
invo lvemen t . However, 
the PRSP wou ld benefit f r om strengthened implementation and 
mon i to r ing arrangements and stronger linkages between ins t i tu t iona l po l ic ies and investment 
decisions. 

42. The monitoring framework o f the PRSP became active in M a r c h 2008; and the 
Government organized reviews o f progress in June and November 2008. The f i r s t annual progress 
repor t (APR) on PRSP implementation - a trigger fo r the H I PC Comp le t ion Po in t - was recently 
finalized. The A PR reflected C AR ’ S good progress with PRS implementation in 2008, as well as 
the Government’s efforts to address t h e most c r i t ica l binding constraints t o pover ty reduc t ion and 
growth, in key areas inc lud ing po l i t ica l reconciliation, infrastructure, the social sectors and 
governance. However, the 2008 s lowdown in economic growth, coupled with an overa l l PRSP 
f inanc ing gap, suggests that the overa l l ambitions o f the PRSP may need to be revised i f the 
vo lume o f donor assistance does no t increase. 

IV . DEVELOPMENT EFFECTIVENESS 

A. Overview o f Donor Support 

43. As a result o f an extended period o f instability, CAR received virtually no aid between 
2000 and 2006. In 2006, a sma l l number o f donors began to re-engage with CAR, united by their 
resolve to: (a) address the country’s unsustainable arrears; (b) facilitate access to H IPC and 
MDRI; (c) support Government efforts to prov ide basic services; and (d) re in force Government 
ac t ion to stabilize the social and po l i t ica l environment. O f f i c i a l Development Assistance (ODA ) 
to C A R more than doubled in 2006 compared to 2005 - f r om US$117 m i l l i o n to US$25 1 m i l l i o n 
(see F igure 2). However, the increase was mos t ly targeted to the settlement o f CAR ’S arrears to 
the W o r l d Bank and the AfDB. That aside, donor support to C A R continues to grow. 

44. While the total volume o f aid f o r development has increased, financing needs still far 
outstrip available resources and the number o f partners engaged in CAR remains limited 
(see Annex 3). Certain sectors remain seriously underfunded, inc lud ing health, education, 
agriculture and ru ra l development. Over the past few years, there has been a s ign i f ican t increase 
in the humanitarian response led by the UN agencies and some 3 5 international NGOs . The UN 
Consolidated Appea l for 2008, for example, reportedly received some US $1 15 m i l l i o n for 
humanitarian efforts, largely but no t exc lus ive ly focused in the no r th o f the country. A s im i lar 
figure i s being sought fo r 2009. In addition, two peace-keeping missions are curren t ly present in 
C A R (UN -M INURC A T ; and C EM A C M ICOPAX ) . M I N U R C A T , wh ich i s based in Chad and 
northern CAR , costs some US$315 m i l l i o n per annum in assessed contributions f rom UN 
member states. F ina l ly , the Bangui-based UN Peace-Building O f f ice , BONUC A , has accessed 
some US$10 m i l l i o n f rom the UN Peace-building Fund in support o f urgent peace-building 
activities. A t this junc ture in the transition to peace, the Government hopes that g row ing s tab i l i ty 
on the ground w i l l a l low fo r a progressive sh i f t f rom humanitarian a id towards more a id for 
development efforts. Go ing forward, CAR ’S ab i l i ty to ma in ta in s tab i l i ty and attain some o f the 
MDGs w i l l require mob i l iza t ion o f s ign i f ican t ly more external resources.

B. Aid Coordination 

45 . The aid coordination mechanism 
in CAR 
i s designed to support PRSP 
implementation, which i s the framework fo r all Government and donor interventions. The 
mechanism includes: (i) the Na t iona l Committee chaired by the Pr ime Minister; (ii) a 
Government-Donor Committee chaired by the Minister o f State fo r Planning, Economy and 
In terna t iona l Cooperation; and (iii) Sectoral Committees chaired by the lead ing ministry fo r each 
sector. The Organization f o r Economic Cooperation and Development’s (OECD’s) 2008 
monitoring report on implementation o f the Paris D e c l a r a t io ~ ’ ~ 
indicated that CAR i s still 
far from meeting the Declaration’s objectives. Challenges relate to weak imp lemen ta t ion o f 
sector strategies; poor traceability o f fore ign a id disbursements in the budget; pers is ten t 
d i f f icu l t ies in the use o f coun try systems; and weak na t iona l statistical and mon i to r ing capacities. 

46. Two recent initiatives will help CAR and its partners improve the prioritization and 
sequencing o f donor support in the transition to peace. F irs t , the Un i ted Na t ions Peace- 
Building Support Office’s dra f t Mapping of Resources and Gaps for Peace-building in the 
Central African Republic (December 2008) presents a u s e f u l analysis o f ongo ing na t iona l and

i s n ow underway to further elaborate this mapp ing and t o expand it beyond peace-building 
activities to include a l l areas o f donor support. Second, the W o r l d Bank, the AfDB and the 
European U n i o n (EU), launched in 2008 a mu l t i-donor in i t ia t ive entitled the Common Approach 
Paper (CAP) to specifically harmonize budget support operations in frag i le states f r om 20 10 
onwards. The C A P aims to develop a common framework fo r evaluating the outcome o f reforms 
supported through the budget. A standard Memorandum o f Understanding (MoU) be tween 
donors and the C A R Government, and a common ma t r ix o f po l icy measures are be ing

structural measures, inc lud ing governance, supported by the PRSP; and (c) pub l ic financial 
management-related measures derived f rom existing ana ly t ica l work . 

V. LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE JOINT INTER IM STRATEGY 

The Joint World BanWAfrican Development Bank Interim Strategy Note ( J ISN ) f o r 
FY2007-2008 sought to: (i) support economic recovery and strengthen public sector 
governance technical capacity development; and (ii) support human development, 
particularly fo r the poor. Desp i te huge capacity constraints, an unfinished peace-building 
process, and uneven governance, implementation o f the JISN has been satisfactory, and has 
begun to produce results (see B o x 3). The key factors accounting fo r this performance inc lude the 
co l labora t ion between the AfDB and the W o r l d Bank, inc lud ing a strong comm i tmen t o f the two 
institutions to respond j o i n t l y to the country’s urgent needs. The two banks fulfilled their 
commitments under the JISN, and responded to emergency situations with timely budget support. 
This support includes the AfDB’s supplementary f inanc ing o f UA 3.797 m i l l i o n (US$5.68 
m i l l ion ) fo r the Economic Re fo rm Support Program (ERSP) in December 2007, and UA 6.5 
m i l l i o n (US$9.72 m i l l ion ) fo r the ERSP I1 in October 2008. I t also includes the W o r l d Bank’s 
emergency assistance o f US$2 m i l l i o n in Ma rch 2008, fo l lowed by the Economic Re fo rm and 
Good Governance Support Program (US$8 m i l l ion ) in M a y 2008.

J I S N implementation also yielded important lessons f o r future engagement in CAR , 
inc lud ing the need to (a) strengthen the linkage between strategic objectives and specific 
outcomes; (b) focus on basic infrastructure and s e r v i c e de l ivery as p r io r i ty needs; (c) shift f rom a 
short-term emergency approach to one o f longer-term economic recovery; and (d) assist the 
authorities in consolidating peace and security and strengthening the ownership o f reforms by 
C A R stakeholders. 

48. AfDB portfolio. The active po r t fo l io o f AfDB operations in C A R as o f January 2009 
comprised four projects to ta l ing UA 41.8 m i l l i o n (US$ 62.6 m i l l ion) , o f wh ich 29.0 percent, has 
been disbursed. (This rate i s 86.35 percent exc lud ing the Program fo r the Fac i l i ta t ion o f Transport 
on the Douala-Bangui and Douala-Ndjamena corridors, wh ich i s a reg iona l operation). Multi-

comprises UA 27.8 m i l l i o n (US$41.5 m i l l ion) , or 66.39 percent. The po r t fo l io i s young, with an 
average pro jec t age o f 1.4 years. I t s performance i s satisfactory, with an ove ra l l score o f 2.4 on a 
scale o f 3. 

49. World Bank G r o u p po r t fo l io . In 2006, the W o r l d Bank, the AfDB, the European Un ion , 
and France re-engaged with CAR , fo l low ing five years o f t h e country being in non-accrual status. 
The WJ3 po r t fo l io became active in November 2006, and since that time, the fo l low ing projects 
have been approved: Emergency U rban Infrastructure (US$18.0 m i l l ion ) , Emergency Food 
Response (US$7.0 m i l l ion) , (restructured) Mu l t i -sec to ra l HIV/AIDs, Hea l th and Educa t ion 
Emergency Support (US$17.0 m i l l ion) , Emergency Energy (US$8.0 m i l l ion) , and Vulnerable 
Groups Commun i ty Development (US$8.0 m i l l ion ) The Bank also supported the C E M A C 
Reg iona l Trade and Transport Fac i l i ta t ion Project, with an a l loca t ion o f US$24.0 m i l l i o n to CAR , 
and the C E M A C Reg iona l F inanc ia l Ins t i tu t ions pro jec t with an a l loca t ion o f US$5.0' m i l l i o n to 
C AR . As o f June 30, 2008, I FC had no comm i t ted po r t fo l io in CAR , but recently posted a 
Representative in Bangui, whose ma in duties are to help improve the country's business 
environment and investment climate, b u i l d ins t i tu t iona l capacity in regulatory bodies t o enable 
reforms, reassure and support investors through the development o f an active por t fo l io , he lp loca l 
f inanc ia l intermediaries to develop products fo r the SME sector, and develop capital markets in 
Central A f r ica . This i s a prerequisite fo r I F C to issue a bond on the reg iona l stock exchange. 
MIGA's gross exposure f rom investment guarantees in C A R i s US$35.4 m i l l ion . In the fou r th 
quarter of FY08 , MIGA issued i t s f i r s t coverage in the country, p rov id ing a guarantee t o French 
investors 
fo r a telecommunications project 
to develop a G loba l System fo r M o b i l e 
Communications (GSM) ne twork and prov ide in te rne t services. 

50. P o r t f o l i o issues. The j o i n t WB/AfDB country performance rev iew in Ma rch 2008 and the 
AfDB country po r t fo l io rev iew in January 2009 revealed a number o f procurement and f inanc ia l 
management issues, inc lud ing weaknesses in pro jec t teams, the impact o f escalating o i l prices on 
project costs, and pervasive ins t i tu t iona l capacity constraints. Bo th banks have intensified their 
support to the mon i to r ing activities carried out by pro jec t coord ina t ion teams, and conducted 
c l in ics on procurement and f inanc ia l management issues . The pos t ing in Bangu i o f seasoned 
W o r l d Bank expertise in sustainable development and f iduc ia ry issues and the s ta f f ing o f the 
recently-opened AfDB reg iona l o f f ice (C AR and Cameroon) in Yaounde also marks strong WBG 
and AfDB comm i tmen t to capacity development and 
to reso lv ing procedural 
(disbursement, non-objection approvals).

VI. AFDB AND WORLD BANK GROUP JOINT COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP 
STRATEGY 

A. CPS Strategic Objective and Principles 

5 1. Support Implementation o f CAR’S Povertv Reduction Stratew. The Country 
Partnership Strategy (CPS) o f the African Development Bank and the World Bank Group 
lays out a shared strategy and lending and non-lending programs f o r CAR over the FY09- 
12 period, in direct response to CAR’s Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRSP) 2008-2010. The 
CPS rea f f irms the commitment o f the AfDB and WBG - the In terna t iona l Development Agency 
(IDA), the In terna t iona l Finance Corporation (IFC), and the Mu l t i la te ra l Investment Guarantee 
Agency (MIGA) - to deliver on the pr inc ip les o f the Paris Dec lara t ion on Aid Effectiveness, and 
to consolidate r e s u l t s achieved under the Jo in t W o r l d BanWA fDB Interim Strategy N o t e (JISN) 
o f 2007-2008. The strategy acknowledges that C A R has come a long way since the f ree elections 
o f 2005 se t the country on a path to peace, but recognizes that that continued progress, re in forced 
by adequate donor support, w i l l be needed to sustain peace and s tab i l i ty . 

52. Tarpet Selectivity and Tangible Results. The CPS FYO9-12 represents the joint 
response o f the AfDB and the WBG to support CAR’s transition from extended instability 
to long-term economic recovery. 
I t i s ta i lored to build on the progress achieved with the 
Government under the JISN, and i s designed to complement support f rom other donors in 
accordance with respective ins t i tu t iona l mandates. Such se lec t iv i ty i s par t icu lar ly impor tan t 
given the constraints on f inanc ing f rom the tw o banks (see Section B. below). On this basis, the 
two institutions have agreed to sustain and deepen their support to areas where they are already 
active and the ir efforts are beg inn ing to show results: pub l ic finance management, transparency 
and accountability in natural resource management; strengthened economic infrastructure and 
pr iva te sector-led growth; and human resource development. This translates d irec t ly through two 
Axes in to j o i n t support targeting PRSP P i l la rs 2 (governance) and 3 (diversification), with WBG 
support also directed to PRSP P i l la r 4 (human development). The two banks are tak ing a more 
limited ro le with respect to P i l la r 1 (restore security, re in force peace e f for ts and prevent conflict), 
g iven strong leadership by the UN in this area and the more proscribed ro le fo r the banks g iven 
their ins t i tu t iona l mandates (see Section E). 

53. Maximize Opportunities fo r Regional Intepration. CAR ’s sma l l and landlocked 
economy i s unable to expand i t s produc t ion base w i thou t access to a larger reg iona l marke t and 
enhanced connectivity. As a result, the CPS w i l l p r io r i t ize regional projects to accelerate the 
development o f CAR’s economic potential. In so doing, the CPS w i l l leverage re la t ive ly sma l l 
country allocations under IDA and ADF respectively in order to access more s ign i f ican t f inanc ing 
available f rom reg iona l funds. 

54. Provide Framework f o r Continuity o f Support under I D A 16 and ADF 12. Since mid- 
2008, the WBG and AfDB have frontloaded resources f rom their country allocations under IDA 
15 and ADF 11 respectively t o support Government e f for ts to address CAR ’s food, fue l and 
f inanc ia l crises. As a resu l t , resources fo r C A R w i l l be constrained in the outer years o f IDA 15 
and ADF 11. The CPS m id- term rev iew w i l l be used to assess CAR ’s emerging development 
pr ior i t ies and prov ide a basis fo r lending scenarios under IDA 16 and ADF 12.

equivalent to approximately US$33 m i l l ion . This includes a F Y 0 9 a l loca t ion o f US$15 m i l l ion , 
US$10 m i l l i o n fo r FYlO and a no t iona l a l loca t ion o f U S $ 8 m i l l i o n fo r f isca l year 2011. The 
actual IDA a l loca t ion fo r C A R may vary annually on the basis o f (a) the country’s performance 
as assessed v ia the Coun try Po l icy and Ins t i tu t iona l Assessmen t indicators and the performance o f 
the Bank’s po r t fo l io in CAR ; (b) the country’s performance re la t ive t o the performance o f other 
IDA countries; (c) overa l l resources available to IDA during the I D A 1 6 rep len ishmen t period; (d) 
changes in the l i s t o f active IDA -e l ig ib le countries, and (e) 
lend ing t e rm s fo r wh ich C A R 
qua l i f ies under the IDA 15 grant e l ig ib i l i ty and a l loca t ion framework. C A R has made use o f the 
IDA Fast Track in i t ia t ive wh ich has enabled fron t load ing o f 150% o f the F Y 0 9 allocation. As a 
result, $22 m i l l i o n o f C AR ’ s ID A 1 5 a l loca t ion was comm i t ted in FY09 . A summary o f WBG

56. H I PC and post-HIPC assistance from Paris Club members, in addition to MDRI debt 
r e l i e f (net o f H I PC assistance), are expected to save CAR some U S U O million per year over 
a period o f twenty years. As a result, and g iven the l im i ted IDA a l loca t ion to CAR , no 
development po l icy operations are anticipated in the W o r l d Bank’s support to the CPS. However, 
the macro-economic situation w i l l be mon i tored closely to assess whether further W o r l d Bank 
budget support becomes necessary to complement the development po l icy operation planned by 
the EU in 2010 and AfDB in 201 1. Factors o f concern relate in particular t o (i) possible further 
negative impac t f rom the g loba l c r i s i s on Government revenues; (ii) Government’s limited 
f le x ib i l i ty t o respond to shocks as evidenced by the projected negative domestic p r ima ry balance 
fo r 2010-1 1; and (iii) Government’s ab i l i ty t o ensure timely payment o f public sector wages, 
wh i ch constitute close to 50 percent o f current expenditures. 

57. CAR i s also expected to benefit from the regional I D A through several reg iona l projects 
described in section C. be low (CPS Outcome 5). Reg iona l projects receive 2/3 o f to ta l pro jec t 
cost f rom the reg iona l allocation, and 1/3 f rom the country allocation, with the country a l loca t ion 
capped at 20 percent o f the to ta l annual country a l loca t ion fo r each project. G iven the limits to 
CAR ’s annual a l loca t ion re la t ive to the size o f reg iona l projects, the share o f the pro jec t funded 
by C AR ’ S country allocation i s generally limited to 20 percent o f the annual country a l loca t ion 
thus leveraging additional reg iona l IDA. The no t iona l a l loca t ion fo r reg iona l projects in C A R 
under IDA 15 (FY09 through FY 11) i s approximately US$90.0 m i l l ion . The amount o f reg iona l

ex terna l i t ies during the funding stage. 
5 8 . CAR i s also eligible f o r various World Bank-administered trust and vertical funds, 
i n c l u d i n g the State and Peace -bu i ld ing Fund and the G l o b a l F o o d C r i s i s Response Fund, among 
others. CAR i s also expected t o be e l i g i b l e f o r the M u l t i -C o u n t r y Re in teg ra t ion and T rans i t iona l 
Suppo r t Program, w h i c h i s c u r r e n t l y b e i n g established. W h e n taken together, the t o t a l amoun t o f

used to finance Phase I1 o f the Economic Re fo rm Support Program (PARE 11) in October 2008. 
Thus, UA 11.22 m i l l i o n (US$ 16.77 m i l l ion ) are available fo r 2009-2010. F r om that amount, UA

The CPS i s built around two strategic axes (see Figure 4), wh ich are aligned with PRSP 
P i l lars 2,3 and 4. 
Axis 1. Consolidation o f Economic Governance and Institutional Capacity, in response 
to PRSP P i l la r 2: Governance, Rule o f L a w and Gender Equity. The objectives o f A x i s 1 are 
to deepen and secure economic reforms and strengthen ins t i tu t iona l capacity, ensure effective 
management o f the country’s resources, and create an enabling environment fo r pr iva te sector 
development. 
Axis 2. Rehabilitation and Development o f Socio-economic Infrastructure, in response 
to PRSP P i l la r 3 : Econom ic D ivers i f ica t ion , and PRSP P i l la r 4 : Human Development. The 
objectives o f A x i s 2 are to ease the infrastructure bottlenecks hindering the rehab i l i ta t ion and 
development o f key sectors, and to improve basic service delivery and the l i v i n g conditions

CAR’s Anti-Corruption Law with UN conventions. 

63 , Support provided under the CPS w i l l also re in force the Government’s macroeconomic 
strategy to ra ise foreign exchange earnings and improve f isca l stability and public spending 
efficiency, in l i n e with PRSP objectives. The Government’s adoption o f appropriate policies w i l l 
help to improve the country’s credibility and attractiveness to investors, foster competition and 
employment generation, and maintain price stability. A World Bank-supported Public 
Expenditure Review (PER - FY 10) w i l l help to improve the efficacy and transparency o f public 
expenditure management, building on the progress achieved s ince the re-engagement in 2006 
with support through three World Bank development policy operations. The PER w i l l also help 
to sustain the constructive dialogue launched under operations on improvements in tax and 
customs administration. 

CPS Outcome 2. Improved Transparency and Accountability in Natura l Resource 
Management. 

64. World Bank support w i l l build upon the findings o f the WB-led mining sector review 
(AAA) carried out within the framework o f the WBG’s budget support operations by supporting 
the Government’s implementation o f the new Mining Code approved on April 28, 2009. The 
Code i s designed to create a transparent and attractive regulatory environment for mining 
companies interested in investing in CAR. The World Bank w i l l prepare a more in-depth review 
o f the diamond sector to assess the extent to which the Government i s effectively capturing these 

key resource rents for development (FYIO). The CPS w i l l also support CAR’s efforts to 
comply with AFLEG and combat i l lega l forest exploitation and to facilitate CAR’s access 
to EU markets. 

65. Since CAR became an E IT I candidate country in November 2008, the country has tw o 
years to execute i t s E IT I accession work plan, and has committed to working closely with civil 
society and mining operators. AfDB and World Bank support to E IT I ++ implementation w i l l 
improve governance and accountability through: (a) Government capacity building in design, 
implementation, and monitoring o f investment projects; (b) stakeholder capacity building in 
extractive industries budget transparency; and (c) debt and data management. The World Bank 
w i l l make available US$300,000 from a multi-donor t r u s t fund to support Government’s efforts to 
implement EITI. Opportunities to complement top-down accountability processes with bottom-up 
accountability mechanisms; full transparency o f resources transferred between the government 
and the mining industry, and enforcement o f CAR’s environmental protection laws w i l l also be 
pursued. Other potential donors include AfDB and UNDP. 

CPS Outcome 3: Strengthened Administrative Planning and Management Capacity at Central 
and Local Levels. 

66. Developing the capacity o f public service institutions i s a cross-cutting issue that i s 
addressed in a l l AfDB and WBG operations in CAR. Additionally, both institutions are providing 
technical assistance to strengthen PRSP implementation and monitoring. 

24 

67 . The AfDB supports the development o f public service capacity through the Program fo r the 
Rehabilitation o f Economic Planning Capacities (PARCPE), which was approved in 2006. The 
AfDB plans to reinforce i t s activity in this area through targeted operations funded by i t s Fragile 
States Facility (US$2 million) in 2009 , and a Multi-Sector Institutional Support Project for core 
economic ministries and public finance bodies for UA 2.5 million (US$3 .7 million) in 2010. 
Support w i l l be targeted to s t a f f secondments, economic and sector studies, and training 

CPS Outcome 4: Improved Investment Climate and M o r e Business Opportunities for Local 
SMEs 

68 . 
IFC, the WBG’s private sector arm, w i l l support improvement o f the business climate and 
S M E development through its Conflict Affected States in Africa (CASA) program. IFC’s 
operations will: (a) strengthen the institutional capacity o f regulatory bodies; (b) reassure 
investors through the development o f an active portfolio; (c) help local financial intermediaries to 
develop products adapted to SME needs; and (d) develop capital markets in the sub-region. IFC 
w i l l also develop leasing products, facilitate publidprivate sector dialogue, and provide venture 
capital-type funding and services to SMEs through i t s Ventures Program, which i s expected to 
provide venture capital to about 50-100 enterprises, amounting to between U S $100,000 and U S 
$500,000. L o c a l demand for investment financing i s expected to grow in response to CAR’S 
progress toward economic recovery. I n the short term, demand by SMEs i s expected to stem 
from: (a) construction and public works, with in f ras t ruc tu re projects funded by development 
partners; (b) trucking and river transport; (c) logging and wood processing; (d) restaurants and 
hotels. Investment demand in agribusiness, health and mining could also be envisaged once 
restructuring measures in these sectors are addressed. 

6 9 . MIGA’s guarantee to S.A. Orange Participations in 2008 i s helping the company to develop 
a GSM network and provide internet services. Given CAR’S transition from fragile to stable 
status, companies interested in setting up business in the country are expected to be interested in 
political risk insurance, particularly against the risk o f war and civil disturbance. MIGA i s also 
ready to provide complementary support to IFC activities in construction, in fras truc ture 
(including energy and transport), agro-industry, manufacturing, and services. I n addition, 
MIGA’s Small Investment Program (SIP), designed to provide rapid response to investments o f 
l e s s than U S $ l O million, i s suitable for SME investments in CAR. 

7 0 . The AfDB has recently introduced the Trade Financing Initiative and the Emergency 
Liquidity Facility, both o f which provide financial support to non-sovereign operations in ADF- 
eligible countries suffering from liquidity shortfalls due to t h e global economic c r i s i s . These new 
instruments w i l l be used to fund trade and private investment opportunities in CAR. 

7 1. F o r A x i s 2, outcomes in fou r areas a r e expected: 

CPS Outcome 5. Improved Infrastructure for Regional Economic Integration 

72. 

E n e r g y . CPS support w i l l help to reverse the serious deterioration o f CAR’S energy 
infrastructure and supply, and w i l l improve the financial and management capacity o f ENERCA, 
the energy utility. Complementary French Development Agency (e 4 million) and World Bank 

25 

(US$ 8 m i l l ion ) projects are helping t o pa r t ia l ly restore re l iab le e lec tr ic i ty supply f rom B o a l i 1 
and tw o hydropower fac i l i t ies to Bangu i customers, inc lud ing the water utility and hospitals. The 
tw o projects are also imp rov ing the f inanc ia l and operating performance o f the sector through the 
in troduc t ion o f cost-efficient light bulbs, pre-payment meters, and a tw inn ing arrangement with 
an ene rgy utility in another A f r ican country. The CPS w i l l also include a US$2.5 m i l l i o n grant 
f r om the W o r l d Bank-administered State and Peace-building Fund fo r emergency rehab i l i ta t ion 
o f hydropower fac i l i t ies with emphasis on dam safety; rehab i l i ta t ion o f the d is tr ibu t ion network; 
and technical assistance to improve corporate governance o f the power sector. Prov is ion o f safer 
and re l iab le power service, ma in ly to Bangui, w i l l make a s ign i f ican t con tr ibu t ion to security and 
pub l ic confidence dur ing the impor tan t trans i t ion to s tab i l i ty . To support energy sector 
restructuring, the W o r l d Bank plans to use Pub l icP r iva te Infrastructure Adv iso ry Fac i l i ty 
(PPIAF) resources t o finance an ene rgy sector re fo rm study, while the AfDB w i l l use t r u s t funds 
to finance an E lec t r ic i ty Sector Master Plan study. 

73 . CAR ’s hydropower supply does no t exceed 18 M W , wh ich i s far be low the demand. T o 
increase supply, AfDB w i l l support f inanc ing fo r B o a l i 3 equipment and fo r extension o f B o a l i 2 
capacity, as part o f a regional pro jec t that also includes DRC . When p r io r i ty investments are 
identified under the Central A f r i c a Power Pool, o f wh ich C A R i s a member, opportunities fo r 
p ro v id ing support f rom the WBG’s IDA 16 a l loca t ion w i l l be explored. 

74. Telecommunications. WBG and AfDB p lan to j o i n t l y finance Phase I o f the Reg iona l 
Fiber Op t ic Cable project (CAR, Cameroon and Chad), wh ich aims to install broadband fiber 
op t ic infrastructure linking Bangu i to Maddougou in Cameroon over the pipeline linking Kr ib i in 
Cameroon t o Doba in Chad, thus o f fe r ing C A R the oppor tun i ty t o connect i t s e l f at a lesser cost to 
the term ina l station o f the inter-continental submarine cable. The AfDB also plans to use b i la tera l 
and trust funds to finance a feas ib i l i ty study on CAR ’s national fiber optic ne twork . 

75. Transport. C A R Government’s infrastructure development strategy comprises th ree 
components: (i) reduction o f the country’s landlocked situation by strengthening linkages to the 
ma in regional ports; (ii) d ivers i f ica t ion o f access routes; and (iii) development o f transport 
infrastructure to development hubs. The W o r l d Bank plans to prov ide additional f inanc ing fo r the 
Cen tra l A f r ica Component o f the C EM A C Transport & Transit Fac i l i ta t ion Project, wh ich i s an 
ongo ing pro jec t financed by the AfDB, W o r l d Bank, French Development Agency, and EU; the 
WBG w i l l mos t ly fund f inanc ing gaps f r om the three other donors and imp rove the l inkage 
between the corr idor and the na t iona l network. The AfDB w i l l undertake feas ib i l i ty s tud ies fo r (a) 
the Ouesso (Congo) - Bangu i - Nd jamena road project; and (b) the Oubangui - Congo - Sangha 
River Transport project, as a basis fo r possible f u t u r e AfDB funding. The support prov ided by 
AfDB and the W o r l d Bank assumes that the Government, through secure funding o f the Road 
Maintenance Funds, and the other donors such as the EU are funding the bulk o f the na t iona l 
network’s maintenance and development in some ma jor cities. This implies that the sustainability 
o f the national road maintenance po l icy and o f the national transport investment p lann ing w i l l be 
an in tegra l part o f the donor dialogue with the Government. 

CPS Outcome 6. Improved Access to Basic Urban and Community Infrastructure 

76 . Urban 
infrastructure. The W o r l d Bank-supported Bangu i Emergency U rban 
Infrastructure Rehab i l i ta t ion and Maintenance Project (US$ l8 .0 m i l l ion ) supports Government 

26 

e f for ts to: (a) increase access to infrastructure and urban services in the most deprived districts o f 
Bangui; and (b) deliver tangible improvements in citizens’ lives, wh ich are c r i t ica l fo r social and 
po l i t i ca l stability. Add i t iona l f inanc ing fo r the WB Urban Infrastructure Project w i l l be prepared 
fo r delivery in FY10 . T o scale-up resu l ts in Bangui’s urban rehabilitation, the AfDB w i l l seek 
t r u s t funds to conduct a study fo r a Bangu i U rban Development Mas ter Plan that w i l l be carried 
ou t in con junc t ion with a Government-led C A R 2040 prospective study. The A D B has financed, 
through the A f r ican Water Fac i l i t y (AWF), a feas ib i l i ty study on Drinking Water Supply and 
Sanitation (AEPA) fo r 16 ma in cities, as a basis fo r an AfDB pro jec t in 2009 cover ing three 
larger cities and po ten t ia l interventions o f other partners. The AfDB’s AWF also plans to 
ma in ta in i t s support to CAR, through an Ins t i tu t iona l Support Project fo r the water and sanitation 
sector. 

77. Community infrastructure. The AfDB and the W o r l d Bank are co- f inanc ing a 
Commun i ty Project fo r the Development and Support o f Vulnerable Groups (PCDAGV ) fo r UA 
8.0 m i l l i o n (US$1 1.9 m i l l ion ) and US $8.0 m i l l ion , respectively. Expected outcomes include 
improved basic loca l government services, especially fo r the rehabilitation, capacity building and 
equipping o f health and education centers in 9 o f the country’s 16 regions. The project i s 
consistent w i t h CAR ’s development hubs strategy and addresses central and southern regions. 

78. An ongoing W o r l d Bank L I C U S Trust Fund Grant fo r Commun i ty -D r iven Development 
and Social Sector Project (US$2.7 m i l l ion ) i s he lp ing to build social capital, prov ide c r i t ica l 
services, and regenerate economic ac t iv i ty in selected communities. Some 80 commun i ty m ic ro - 
projects are close to completion, hav ing improved tangible service outcomes in health, education, 
management o f agr icu l tura l produce, and market place rehabilitation. 

CPS Outcome 7. Improved Agriculture and Livestock Productivity 

79. The AfDB and Wo r ld Bank responded to the 2008 food cr is is with projects in C A R to ta l ing 
UA3 .0 m i l l i o n and US$7.0 m i l l ion , respectively. Go ing forward, the AfDB w i l l finance a Ru ra l 
Infrastructure Rehab i l i ta t ion Project fo r UA 4.0 m i l l i o n (US$5.9 m i l l ion ) . The p ro jec t w i l l 

target 

imp rovemen t o f r u r a l roads, v i l lage water schemes, comme rc ia l iza t ion 

infrastructure, and research. The W o r l d Bank w i l l prepare a fo l low -on ru ra l development 
operation fo r US$lO.O m i l l i o n in FY 12 designed to boost stabilization efforts; strengthen 
agr icu l tura l supply and food security (through improved p lan t ing ma ter ia l and inputs); and 
develop loca l technical capacity to improve produc t iv i ty , post-harvest infrastructure, and 
marketing. Support f rom this operation wou ld help to strengthen management capacities o f the 
Ministry o f Ru ra l Development and the Ag r icu l tu ra l Research I n s t i t u t e . 

CPS Outcome 8. Improved Access to Quality Education and Hea lth Services 

80. Education. F ina l iza t ion o f CAR ’s Na t iona l Education Strategy in 2007 prov ided the basis 
fo r CAR ’S successful app l ica t ion t o the Education fo r A l l-Fas t Track In i t ia t ive Ca ta ly t ic Fund fo r 
a grant o f U S $ 38.0 m i l l ion , fac i l i ta ted b y the W o r l d Bank. The grant w i l l finance the first three- 
year phase o f an ambitious program to meet t h e MDGs fo r education. Resu l ts are expected to 
inc lude improved basic ins t i tu t iona l capacity in the sector, but more predictable funding f lows 
and systematic capacity building e f for ts w i l l be needed dur ing subsequent phases to sustain 
administrative infrastructure, strategic planning, and managerial improvements. 

27 

8 1. Health. The ongoing World Bank-financed (restructured) Multi-Sector HIV/AIDS, Health 
and Education Emergency Support Project ( U S $ 17.5 million) w i l l continue to help CAR address 
HIV/AIDS and provide basic health and primary education services. The project supports service 
delivery to c iv i l society, and strengthens the capacity o f government to provide prevention, care 
and treatment. I t also supports improved emergency health responses a t the community level, and 
provides HIV/AIDs training for student-teachers. The World Bank plans carry out a Health Sector 
Finance Assessment to address long-standing insufficient budget allocations to hea l th and poor 
access to health services, especially fo r vulnerable groups. The analysis w i l l also focus on 
building more effective partnerships between the public and private sectors for improved health 
outcomes and achievement o f the MDG. This w i l l serve as the basis for a new WB-financed 
health project for delivery in FY 12. 

E. Cross-cutting I s su e s 

82. State and Peace-building. The UN system, led by i t s peacekeeping o f f i c e in CAR (known 
as BONUCA), in partnership with the European Commission and key bilaterals, i s taking the lead 
in supporting the high-level political dialogue between the Government and opposition groups, as 
well as in security sector work. CAR i s now formally also under the aegis o f the UN Peace- 
building Commission, which has played a catalytic role in strengthening support for the peace 
process. Strategic support to the political process i s underpinned by work on governance, 
elections and security sector reform. Within their respective mandates, the World Bank and AfDB 
are also supporting the fragile transition. W h i l e UNDP i s taking the lead in demobilization 
e f for ts , the AfDB and World Bank plan to use resources from the new Multi-Country 
Demobilization and Reintegration Transitional Support Program (MDRTSP) to create jobs and 
support community initiatives in northern areas. 16 The MDRTSP w i l l complement UNDP’s 
support to CAR. Further, in support o f peace-building and security, a World Bank trust fund for 
low income countries under s t ress (LICUS countries) i s strengthening capacity and systems for 
security expenditure management. Outcomes w i l l include improved understanding o f security 
sector finance, civilian governance and oversight. I f pending applications are approved, funding 
from the World Bank-administered Japanese Social Development Fund (JSDF) and the State and 
Peace-building Fund (SPF) w i l l target community recovery in northern areas, particularly in those 
with a high density o f ex-combatants. Outcomes w i l l include increased community participation 
in local development planning and project implementation. 

83 . Environment and climate change. The Congo Basin Forest Fund (CBFF) launched in 
June 2008; 
the AfDB-supported Lake Chad Basin Regional Development Project 
(PRODEBALT) approved in December 2008; and the Regional Program for Congo Basin 
Ecosystem Conservation (PACEBCO) approved in February 2009, w i l l help the authorities to 
address critical environmental and climate change challenges. The World Bank i s currently 
preparing a Country Environmental Assessment to be delivered in 20 10. From the regional 
environment perspective, CAR participates in the GEF-supported Regional REDD (Reducing 
Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) Project for the Congo Basin. The REDD 
Project w i l l continue to support CAR’S e f fo r ts to develop: (a) appropriate methodology for 

16 

The program in the Great Lakes area i s the Transitional Demobilization and Reintegration Program for 
the Great Lakes (TDRP). 

28 

reliable measurement o f carbon stored in forests and resulting from deforestation and 
degradation; and (b) national capacity for carbon measurement. 

84 . Capacity development. CAR’S profound institutional and human capacity deficit w i l l take 
many years to overcome. The CPS’s Axes 1 and 2 w i l l provide the framework for both WBG and 
AfDB to develop on-the-job capacity in economic governance and project management. Through 
implementation support, t h e two institutions w i l l continue to help develop capacity across 
implementation agencies over the longer term, focusing especially on core economic ministries 
and the l i n e ministries overseeing implementation o f joint projects. I n addition, both banks w i l l 
work with the Parliament and other stakeholders to improve understanding o f PRSP linkages to 
the national budget and to strengthen their capacity to monitor CPS implementation. They w i l l 
also seek opportunities to mobilize the CAR Diaspora through possible term placements in 
Government and semi-state assignments, and through the creation o f business promotion 
networks. Finally, the AfDB and WBG w i l l continue to assess and address capacity challenges 
during the CPS period, drawing on good practice and lessons from recent World Bank country 
strategies, including those for M a l i and Rwanda. 

8 5 . Gender equity. The AfDB and WBG w i l l make a concerted effort to support CAR’S 
national gender equity promotion and economic empowerment policy through their operational 
portfolios and in consultations on CPS implementation and monitoring. AfDB’s Targeted Support 
w i l l promote women’s participation in socioeconomic development through technical assistance 
and a secondment program for women’s associations and groups. 

F. CPS Dialogue with C A R Authorities and Participatory Approach 

86 . The CPS was prepared and will be monitored using a participatory approach based 
on the partnership principles o f the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. An upstream 
mission o f the World Bank Group (IDA, IFC and MIGA) and the AfDB took place in CAR i n 
November 2008 to discuss the main areas and expected outcomes o f joint support under the CPS. 
A recently completed Client Survey (May 2 0 0 9 ) w i l l provide valuable complementary input for 
CPS monitoring, and for sustaining client engagement in that process. Consistent with the 
internal processing requirements o f the respective banks, downstream consultations were held 
between the WBG and the Government, civil society organizations and NGOs, the private sector, 
the Parliament, and development partners in early May 2009 . A CPS validation exercise was held 
between the AfDB and the authorities in June 2009 . Consultations provided an opportunity to 
engage on the CPS with domestic stakeholders including Parliament, civil society and NGOs, and 
the mass media. At the conclusion o f the consultations, the authorities confirmed that the CPS 
addresses the CAR’S main development challenges and provides a sound basis for the AfDB and 
WBG to achieve desired results. 

G. Joint CPS Monitoring 

8 7 . The CPS has been designed with a clear focus on achieving and demonstrating 
tangible results, using the Results Ma t r ix shown i n Annex 1. CAR’S PRSP forms the basis for 
tracking progress on each pillar, with joint emphasis on P i l lars 2 and 3, and specific WBG focus 
on Pillar 4 . Results anticipated from the CPS w i l l stem mainly from current operations and 
rapidly disbursing interventions, and the results framework i s closely linked to expected results 

29 

from the current and planned operational portfolio and analytical work. Efforts to link CPS 
outcomes directly to PRSP goals and monitoring indicators remain hampered by weak statistical 
capacity in CAR to provide primary data, and slow implementation o f the PRSP’s monitoring and 
evaluation mechanisms. CPS monitoring and evaluation w i l l therefore be carr ied out mainly in 
relation to t h e indicators and milestones contained in the Results Matrix. 

88 . CPS outcomes will be monitored collectively by the joint team and the Government. 
Increased WBG field presence in CAR w i l l help to strengthen the effectiveness o f CPS 
monitoring and evaluation. Annual Joint Country Program and Portfolio Reviews aligned w i th 
the Resu l ts Matrix, combined w i th more frequent m i n i reviews, w i l l be ca r r ied out in close 
collaboration w i th other development partners. In 2010, a jo in t CPS Progress Report w i l l be 
prepared, and mid-course adjustments may be made in light o f i t s findings, or should new funding 
sources become available. A CPS Completion Report w i l l be prepared at the end o f the 
implementation period to assess overall CPS resu l ts and to draw relevant lessons for f u t u r e 
support. 

8 9 . CPS consultations, along with a Client Survey (fieldwork finalized in May 2009) , will 
form a baseline assessment fo r helping Government to strengthen domestic accountability 
for PRSP and CPS monitoring. Joint CPS Program and Portfolio Reviews w i l l provide a further 
opportunity to encourage stakeholder engagement in CPS monitoring, drawing upon emerging 
global good practice. Finally, based on emerging good practice from the WBG’s Governance and 
Anti-Corruption Initiative (GAC-in-Projects), innovative approaches for initiating stakeholder 
participation at the project design stage w i l l be used to strengthen the quality o f project 
monitoring and evaluation, and to deepen national ownership o f development efforts. Such efforts 
could include participatory budgeting, systematic public expenditure tracking by beneficiaries, 
and independent monitoring by NGOs. 

H. Risk Management and Mitigation 

9 0 . Security and political risk Despite recen t progress under the Inclusive Political Dialogue, 
CAR continues to face the risk o f sporadic violence in the north and cen ter o f the country. Risks 
stemming from CAR’S landlocked position in an unstable sub-region also make the country 
susceptible to the destabilizing influence o f cross-border movement o f armed rebel groups. In 
addition, groups o f ex-combatants awaiting reintegration and rehabilitation opportunities, as we l l 
as political groups that have been marginalized in the existing political context, continue to pose 
challenges to secur i ty . Cognizant o f these risks, the CPS aims to support Government’s 
commitment to pursue a r e a l i s t i c but comprehensive development plan which looks beyond 
national elections in 2010 and envisages providing services across most o f the territory. The 
WBG and A fDB w i l l also work w i th in the framework o f support provided through the UN 
system, which i s taking the lead in security matters. The jo in t Multi-country Donor Trust Fund to 
Support Reintegration (MDRTSP), in addition to the state and peace-building t r u s t funds o f both 
institutions, w i l l help efforts to consolidate peace and stability. However, sustained support from 

all donors present in CAR w i l l be needed to address this risk. 

91. Macroeconomic risk. Given the export-based structure o f i t s economy, CAR i s seriously 
exposed to shocks, and i s vulnerable to further negative impacts on i t s current account, reserves, 
revenue, and growth, and thereby on i t s ability to address poverty. The 2008 economic cr is is , 

30 

combined with other external shocks, has had a significant impact on these variables. 

Appropriate policy adjustments and donor inflows w i l l be needed over the medium term to help 
CAR address 
its challenging fiscal obligations. 
I n this regard, the emerging donor 
harmonization action p lan led by the World Bank, the A j D B and the EU can help to reduce 
recent uncertainties in donor support. Given continued uncertainty with the world economic 
situation, should CAR ’S macroeconomic situation change 
in 
the course of CPS 
implementation, the WBG would also re-consider the balance between investment lending and 
development policy lending in the CPS program 

9 2 . Expectations risk. The positive outcome o f the Inclusive Political Dialogue raised popular 
expectations that peace and stabilization w i l l soon return to CAR. However, the State institutions 
- including the police and judiciary - responsible fo r protecting citizens’ human rights remain 
fragile and underdeveloped. Widespread unemployment, and the perception that the early peace 
has not yet yielded tangible benefits, poses important risks to stability during the CPS period 

This risk can be partially mitigated by IFC’s and M I G A ’s support to private sector-led growth 
and job creation, and through WBG /A jDB projects designed to develop regional, urban, and 
community infrastructure - including energy, transport, water, and telecommunications - and 
improve the population’s access to basic services. 

9 3 . Corruption risk. Corruption and the abuse o f power and privileges continue to thwart 
effective policy implementation, poverty reduction, and the Government’s ability to regain the 
population’s trust. Despite outstanding challenges, the Government has demonstrated 

commitment to f igh t corruption, by finalizing an anti-corruption strategy, revising mining and 
forestry codes and 
legislation, and passing anti-corruption 
legislation. Further, 
the 
Government has shown 
its commitment to enhancing governance, transparency, and 
accountability through the adherence to measures designed to fulfill CAR ’S requirements for 
membership in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. 

94. 
Institutional capacity risk. The Government’s shortage o f capacity to implement reforms 
poses another significant risk. This risk i s mitigated by the support provided by the WBG, AfDB 
and other development partners, but long-term investments in capacity development are urgently 

needed. This risk w i l l be partially mitigated through CPS activities that build capacity at the 
project implementation level, and help to strengthen the capacity of specific government 
agencies in charge of 
implementing reforms. Implementation support provided by A j D B and 
WBG w i l l continue to build the capacity of ministries and agencies and project teams. I n 
addition, increased WBG presence in CAR, including a recently opened IFC office and new 
staff appointments in sustainable development and fiduciary management, w i l l reinforce the 
focus of work programs on implementation and achieving results. 

I. Sca l ing-Up a n d E x i t Strategy 

9 5 . 
I f current trends persist, the World Bank will continue to provide allocations from 
IDA ; the AfDB will operate under ADF; and the I F C and M I G A will scale up engagement 
and actively explore private sector financing opportunities in CAR. Both the WBG and 
AfDB w i l l also pursue alternative funding to overcome the severe constraints to their 
concessional financing windows. Satisfactory implementation o f the investment portfolio would 
provide an important basis for moving forward with the operations outlined in the joint strategy. 

3 1 

96 . 
I n the event o f unsatisfactory progress on reform, the World Bank Group and AfDB 
would enter into dialogue regarding the basis o f future operations. Should poor portfolio 
the 

performance arise, 
institutions would adjust their operations as needed, revising 
implementation schedules and planned activities, or, in the case o f severe obstacles, would 
partially suspend their activities. Lack o f progress on reform would also affect the private sector’s 
appetite for investment and thus the ability o f the IFC, M IG A and the A fDB to finance and 
guarantee private sector projects. D e s p i t e the significant challenges and r isks , the institutions 
remain committed to helping CAR ensure that the population benefits from development efforts 
over the long te rm .

Annex 2. Central African Republic: 
Debt Sustainability Analysis Using the Low-Income Country Framework 

According to the analysis based on the j o i n t IMF- World Bank debt sustainability fiamework for 
low-income c o ~ n t r i e s , ’ ~ Central Afiican Republic (CAR) has a ’ moderate risk of debt distress.20 
Thanks to debt relief under the enhanced H IPC initiative and MDN, CAR ’s external and public 
debt burden indicators 
improve sign$cantly 
through the projection period. The debt 
sustainability analysis shows, however, that CAR continues to be vulnerable to certain shocks 
and could breach the threshold for the NPV of external debt-to-exports ratio in the most ex treme 
scenario. 

BACKGROUND 

This analysis i s based on the forward-looking debt sustainability framework f o r

low-income countries (L IC DSA). T h e L I C D S A uses the r e c o n c i l e d deb t database prepared f o r

the me thodo log ies app l ied : (i) the d iscoun t ra te in the L I C D S A i s f i x e d at 5 percent, compared t o 
the cu r rency -spec i f ic 6 -mon th averages o f c omm e r c i a l in teres t re ference rates (C IRR ) used in t h e 
H I P C D S A ; (ii) WE0 exchange ra te assumptions are used f o r ca lcu la t ing the present va lue o f

UNDERLYING DSA ASSUMPTIONS 

4. 
The near-term macroeconomic outlook i s influenced by the adverse impact o f the 
international financial c r is is . Despite favorable developments for the import price o f oil, the 
sudden drop o f timber and diamonds exports implies lower GDP growth and a worse external 
curren t account balance. Along w i th lower revenue projected for 2 0 0 9 , the additional spending 
necessary to consolidate the peace process and finance the 2010 elections moves the domestic 
primary balance into negative territory in 2 0 0 9 ; however, the primary balance including grants 
remains in surplus. 

5 . 

Over the medium and long term, CAR i s presumed to achieve a steady-state growth 
path, supported by political and social stability. A sustained improvement in business 
confidence and higher investment should underpin these growth projections (Box 4). Growing 
exports o f a diversified range o f primary goods, including gold and uranium, are expected to l i f t 
real GDP growth to 5 .5 percent in the medium t e rm . Stronger exports w i l l help improve the 
external current account deficit over time to around 4 percent o f GDP, w i th financing primarily 
provided by private investment, highly concessional project loans, and the regional market for 
government secur i t ies expected to be launched in 20 10. In order to preserve debt sustainability, 
f i s c a l policy would remain prudent. The authorities’ f i s c a l anchor i s the domestic primary 
balance, which would be in surplus until 2 0 2 0 . The primary balance including grants would be 
higher than the primary balance needed to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio for the projection 
period; thus, the debt-to-GDP ratio could decline by some 10 percentage points to 2 0 percent o f 
GDP by 2029 . 

6. 
The r i s k s to CAR’S macroeconomic outlook, however, remain significant. 
Potentially, political uncertainty and a worsening social and secur i ty situation could hamper 
donor support and investor confidence. Exogenous shocks, including a prolonged impact o f the 
global economic c r i s i s on exports, could lead to slower growth, lower revenue, and deterioration 
in debt indicators. Moreover, insufficient investments in infrastructure, such as roads, could cause 
delays in private sector investment projects that are needed to boost the C A R economy and 
reduce poverty. 

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTA INAB IL ITY ANALYSIS 

7 . 

Fo l low ing H IPC and MDFU re l ief , a l l debt ind icators a r e expected to r em a i n 
be low the re levan t thresholds th roughou t the p ro jec t ion pe r iod in the baseline 
scenario. The ne t p resen t value (NPV) o f the debt service-to-export ra t io and the NPV o f 
the debt service-to-revenue ra t io increase tempo ra r i ly ove r the medium t e r m due t o debt 
service payments o n new debts f o l l ow i n g the standard grace periods, but the ra t ios w o u l d 
stay well b e l ow the thresholds that define an excessive debt burden. A l l other debt 
indicators rema in well b e l ow the thresholds f o r the p ro jec t ion pe r iod and show stable 
downwa rd trends. 

42 

Box 4: Baseline Macroeconomic Assumptions 

R e a l GDP growth: Average annual rea l GDP growth for 2009-29 i s projected at 4.4 percent, 
which i s predicated on sustained security and political stability, an improvement in the country’s 
institutional and administrative capacity, and appropriate macroeconomic policies. This 
environment should encourage an increase in private investment, especially in forestry, mining, 
and telecommunications. Public investment in infrastructure would help revive agriculture, which 
dominates economic activity. With these assumptions, the projected growth rate i s significantly 
higher than t h e historical average, which was characterized by conflicts and c iv i l s t r i fe . 

Inflation: After unexpectedly high inflation in 2008 , the GDP deflator i s projected to increase by 
2% percent on average for 2009-29; t h i s assumes that inflation w i l l moderate promptly from the 
current level. The projected inflation rate i s in l i n e with the Central African Economic and 
Monetary Community (CEMAC)’s convergence criterion o f 3 percent (defined by the CPI). 

Cu r ren t account balance: T h e current account deficit (including grants) i s projected to average 
7 percent for 2009-29. The trade balance i s projected to improve over time, driven by stronger 
export performance as a result o f structural reforms and infrastructure investments that w i l l 
enhance competitiveness and diversification o f the export base; the deficits in the services balance 
would remain large. The current account deficits would be financed primarily by o f f i c i a l 
development assistance (project loans), foreign direct investment, and regional capital inflows 
from the future regional government securities market. A major gold mining project i s assumed to 
start in 20 1 1. The new forestry and mining codes should prepare the ground for sustained FD I 
inflows in t h e s e sectors. 

Government balance: The domestic primary surplus would be in surplus until 2019 and then 
decline to zero between 2020-29 . The overall f i s c a l deficit (including grants) i s projected to 
average about 1.2 percent o f GDP for 2009-29; with the primary balance consistently higher than 
the one needed to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio. Domestic revenue i s projected to r i s e from 
10% percent o f GDP in 2009 to some 14 percent at end-2029, mainly as a result o f steady tax and 
customs administration improvements and tax policy reform to render the tax code more growth 
compatible. Expenditures are projected to r i s e from about 17 percent o f GDP in 2009 to about 
20 percent in 2029 with most o f t h e increases concentrated in infrastructure investments. 

Externa l assistance: Total grants and loans are assumed to contribute about 5.4 percent o f 
nominal GDP in the long run. Grants are assumed to account for about 80 percent o f total external 
assistance, with the grant element o f new external loans averaging 52 percent for the period. 

Domestic borrowing: I t i s assumed that in 2010 , the government w i l l start accessing the securities 
markets that are being developed in the CEMAC region. This w i l l allow i t to reduce financing 
costs, improve liquidity managements, and repay domestic arrears. Given the continued prudent 
f i s c a l policy stance, domestic debt i s expected to decline during the projection period. 

Rea l interest rate on domestic currency debt: The average r e a l interest rate on domestic 
currency debt (including bonds from the regional markets) should converge to about 4.7 percent in 
the long run.

8. 
The h is to r ica l scenario appears m u c h mo re favo rab le than the baseline scenario 
because o f severely compressed impo r ts during CAR’s h is to ry o f con f l ic t . Thus, the 
h is to r ica l scenario i s based o n the average noninterest current account d e f i c i t o f o n l y 
2.2 percent o f GDP, compared t o the p ro jec ted d e f i c i t o f 7 percent o f GDP under the 
baseline scenario; such scenario w o u l d be u n l i k e l y g i v e n recent trends and detrimental t o 
economic g r ow t h and in teg ra t ion o f CAR i n t o the w o r l d economy. 

9. 
The bound tests underscore potential risks, especially regarding lower export 
growth. The mos t extreme stress test, w h i c h assumes a comb ina t ion o f shocks but mos t ly 
affected by l ow e r expo r t value g r ow t h in the CAR’s case, w o u l d raise the N P V o f the 
debt-to-exports ra t io above the threshold f o r a p ro longed pe r iod . 22 The debt service-to- 
exports ra t io w o u l d also exceed the threshold during 2 0 1 5 -20 16 under the l o w expo r t 
g r ow t h scenario. The deterioration o f debt indicators unde r these scenarios underline that 
continuous e f fo r ts are necessary t o develop CAR’s exports, i n c l u d i n g im p r o v i n g the 
business c l ima te f o r foreign investments, reduc ing transport costs, and im p r o v i n g 
p roduc t iv i ty . 

PUBL IC DEBT SUSTA INAB IL ITY ANALYSIS 

10. H IPC and MDRI debt r e l i e f w i l l improve public debt indicators significantly 
s ince public external debt accounts f o r almost ha lf o f public debt stock. With an 
assumption o f lowe r p rog ram grants than in the recent past (0.7 percent o f GDP over the 
l o n g term) , and with well-managed financing, a l l debt ind ica to rs a re expected t o decline 
gradually. I t i s assumed that the government w o u l d con t inue i t s p ruden t f isca l p o l i c y by 
ma in ta in ing a domestic primary balance surplus in the m e d i um t e r m and balance over the 
l o n g te rm ; m o b i l i z i n g a higher domestic revenue-to-GDP ra t io ; and securing re la t ive ly 
low -cos t f inanc ing such as highly concessional loans. Accessing the reg iona l government 
securities markets starting in 20 10 w o u l d h e l p e l im ina te expensive credits f r om 
comme rc ia l banks over the next several years and clear domestic arrears. Under these 
assumptions, the N P V o f the p u b l i c debt-to-GDP ra t io w o u l d decline f r o m 28 percent o f 
GDP in 2009 t o 17 percent o f GDP in 2029, w h i l e the NPV o f p u b l i c debt-to-revenue 
ra t io w o u l d f a l l f r o m 174 percent t o 90 percent. 

1 1. 
A l l debt indicators would deteriorate rapidly i f rea l GDP growth were slower 
o r debt-creating flows were to increase. L ow e r GDP g r ow t h represents the mos t 
extreme scenario: in this case, both the N P V o f the debt-to-GDP ra t io and the N P V o f the 
debt-to-revenue ra t io as w e l l as the debt service-to-revenue r a t i o w o u l d r ise overtime. 

22 The combination o f shocks consists o f (i) Real GDP growth at historical average minus one-half standard 
deviation in 2010-201 1, (ii) Export value growth at historical average minus one-half standard deviation in 
2010-201 1, (iii) U S dollar GDP deflator at historical average minus one-half standard deviation in 2010- 
201 1, and (iv) Net non-debt creating flows at historical average minus one standard deviation in 2010- 
2011.

DEBT DISTRESS QUALIFICATION 

AND CONCLUS IONS 

12. 
CAR qualifies as having a “moderate risk o f debt distress”. A l l debt indicators 
im p r o v e d rama t ica l ly f o l l ow i n g the H IPC comp le t ion p o i n t and debt r e l i e f under the 
MDRI, but i t s ove ra l l debt pos i t ion cou ld s t i l l be vulnerable t o a va r ie ty o f shocks. The 
ex te rna l debt indicators are pa r t i cu la r ly sensitive t o expo r t growth, ind ica t ing that

p u b l i c debt indicators a re vulnerable t o s lowe r GDP g r ow t h and an increase in debt- 
c rea t ing f lows , c o n f i rm i n g that CAR needs t o pursue prudent f isca l po l ic ies over the 
medium-term and t o consolidate the basis for g r ow t h by fos te r ing domestic security,

Annex 10: Central African Republic: Country Financing Parameters 

Date: November 13,2006 

The country financing parameters for the Central A f r ican Republic (CAR) se t out be low 
have been approved b y the Regional V i c e President, A f r ica Region, and a re being posted 
on the Bank’s internal website. These parameters w i l l be updated du r ing preparation o f 
the next Country Assistance Strategy. 

I tem 

Cost sharing. 
Limit on the proportion o f 
individual project costs that IDA 

may f inance 

Parameter 
100% 

Recurrent costfinancing. 
Any limits that would apply to the 
overall amount o f recu r ren t 
expenditures that the Bank may 
finance. 

NO country- 
level l im i t 

Local cost financing. 
A r e the requirements for IDA 
financing o f local expenditures 
met, namely that: (i) financing 
requirements for the country’s 
development program would 
exceed the public sector’s own 
resources (e.g., from taxation and 
other revenues) and expected 
domestic borrowing; and (ii) the 
financing o f foreign expenditures 
alone would not enable IDA to 
adequately assist in the financing 
o f individual projects? 
Taxes and duties. 
A r e there any taxes and duties that 
the Bank would not finance? 

Yes 

N o 

RemarkIExplanation 
At this time, a l l projects are expected to be fmanced at 
loo% , given government’s extremely small budget and 
inability to provide counterpart funding. In the near 
term, only when cofinancing i s available w i l l t h e 
Bank’s cost share be less. Ownership o f Bank-financed 
programs i s being ensured through a close relationship 
between the Bank and the Government’s top 
leadership. At the project level, ownership i s being 
ensured through means such as close supervision and 
capacity-building o f government institutions, and 
placing project management responsibilities directly in 
the concerned ministries. 
N o country-level l im i t i s being set on recurrent cost 
financing. Recurrent costs may be financed as needed 
in individual projects, subject t o project or program- 
level assessment. In determining Bank financing o f 
recurrent costs in individual projects, the Bank w i l l 
take into account sustainability issues at the sector and 
project levels, including a consideration o f implied 
h t u r e budgetary outlays. 
The requirements for local cost financing are met. The 
Bank may finance local costs in any proportions 
required by individual projects. 

Taxes and duties are considered reasonable. The 
application o f t h i s general approach w i l l be subject to 
an ongoing monitoring o f tax policy and how taxes are 
applied to Bank-financed projects. At the project 
level, the Bank w i l l consider whether taxes and duties 
constitute an excessively high share o f project costs.
