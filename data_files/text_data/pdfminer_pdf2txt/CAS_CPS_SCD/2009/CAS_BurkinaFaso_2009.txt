I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

I n the last two decades Bu rk ina F a s o , a small, resource poor, land locked country, has 
achieved significant progress towards development. Po l i t ica l stability and the 
Government’s progressive p la t fo rm o f economic and social reforms, sound macro 
economic policies and steady investment enabled Bu rk ina t o sustain significant g row th 
rates (averaging 6 percent per annum) and ma in ta in relative macro-economic stability 
over the decade preceding 2007. 
Steady economic growth, 
increase o f social 
expenditures and significant improvements in access t o basic services saw a decline in 
the incidence o f poverty 

Yet, Burkina’s economy remains vulnerable and the recent series of exogenous shocks 
are taking a significant toll on Burkina’s development, highlighting the importance of 
diversification. Since 2 0 0 7 , variable rainfall, fluctuating commod i ty prices, f u e l and 
food price increases and, recently, the global financial crisis have resulted in a decline in 
g row th rates and a r i s e in the incidence o f poverty. The possible prolongation o f the 
global recession, wh ich cou ld invo lve lowe r cotton prices, lowe r capital f lows f r om FDI 
and O D A and weaker demand fo r BurkinabC exports r i s k s further reversing Burkina’s 
positive development trend. 
In this d i f f i c u l t context, Bu rk ina faces the challenge o f 
sustaining i t s positive g row th trajectory, while at t h e same time lay ing the foundation fo r 
a diversified economy and decreased vulnerability to exogenous shocks. 

Despite significant investments in basic services, Burkina’s ranking in human 
development continues to be low and an unbridled population growth rate of 3.1 
percent impedes the country’s efforts 
to reduce poverty. With limited fiscal space, 
significant popu la t ion g row th and the move towards decentralized service delivery, 
imp rov ing governance and efficiency o f social service delivery i s c r i t ica l fo r making 
progress in human development. Fac i l i ta t ing a demographic transition, strengthening the 
‘voice’ o f citizens and p romo t ing community participation in decision-making are v i t a l 
parts o f this process. 

This CAS aligns with the Government strategy for growth and sustainable 
development. 
I t seeks to assist Bu rk ina F a s o to begin to transform its economy, 
support equitable and shared growth and make progress on human development, while 
providingflexibility to address the impact of 
the global recession. T h e global crisis 
presents an opportunity fo r Bu rk ina to focus o n diversification and stronger agricultural 
performance and the CAS aims t o help transform this opportunity in to a reality. The 
strategy harnesses the Government’s commitment to imp roved governance and enhanced 
pub l ic participation and aims t o help improve social service delivery. I t adopts new ways 
o f doing business w h i c h invo lve better positioning Burkina’s development in a regional 
context; strengthening analytical support and developing results-focused approaches to 
the emerging i s s u e s o f environmental preservation and demography. At the same time, 
and tak ing in to account the potential impact o f the crisis o n B u r k i n a Faso, the CAS seeks 
to support more immediate efforts to address the country’s economic and social 
vulnerabilities and i t maintains flexibility fo r adjustments in the program. 

To enhance development impact, the strategy adopts a highly selective approach wh ich 

i s framed around two strategic themes and two cross-cutting issues : 

S t ra teg ic t h em e one: Minimizing econom ic v u l n e r a b i l i t y and p r o m o t i n g 
g r o w t h t h r o u g h econom ic t r a n s f o rm a t i o n . Ac t iv i t ies w i l l concentrate on 

sustaining good performance in the cotton sector, increasing agricultural 
productivity, encouraging diversification towards commercialized agriculture and 
m in ing and strengthening regional integration. 

S t ra teg ic t h em e two: P r o m o t i n g s h a r e d g r o w t h t h r o u g h e f fec t ive soc ia l 

se rv ice d e l i v e r y . Ac t iv i t ies w i l l target bu i ld ing demand fo r transparent and 
quality social se rv ice delivery, imp rov ing pub l ic resource management and 
Strengthening the capacity o f central and loca l institutions to deliver social 
services. 

C ross -cu t t ing issues: G iven the cross-cutting pertinence o f governance and 
demography fo r growth and social service delivery, 
these 
mainstreamed in to a l l activities envisaged under the CAS. 

issues w i l l be 

I n line with the Government’s request and renewed donor commitment, the strategy 
seeks to raise the stakes on aid effectiveness 

through: continued h i g h levels o f budget 
support; targeted support to facilitate the eventual use o f country sys tems and close 
coordination with other donors in sectoral activities, j o i n t analytical wo rk and in the 
preparation o f a j o i n t donor assistance strategy in FY 12. 

While the overall outlook for Bu rk ina Faso is positive, several risks have been 
identified which could derail the implementation of 
the CAS or limit i t s impact, the 

most important being the possibility o f a prolonged global recession, climatic shocks, 
limited capacity and coordination risks associated with the multi-sectoral program. The 
CAS sets in place mechanisms to mitigate these risks.

COUNTRY CONTEXT 

1 . 
Bu rk ina Faso is a small, predominantly rural, land- 
locked West African country bordered by s k neighbors. The 

rap id ly expanding popu la t ion o f 13.7 m i l l i o n inhabitants r e l i e s 
upon a very na r row natural resource base, with cotton as the 
on ly ma jo r existing export commodity. The agrarian economy 
i s pa r t icu la r ly vulnerable to c l ima t ic and external shocks. 
Burkina’s fragile Sahelian environment i s drought-prone and 
susceptible to f lood ing and external factors, such as fluctuating 
fue l , food and cotton prices, wh i ch have a significant impact o n 
the nation. As a land-locked country, Bu rk ina Faso i s h i g h l y 
dependent o n good relations with i t s neighbors fo r trans i t , trade 
with external markets and po l i t ica l stability. 

A. 

POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE 

2. 

Since the early 19903 , Bu rk ina Faso has benefited from relative political 
stability, democratic rule and a progressive platform of economic and political reforms. 

Under the leadership o f President Blaise Compaore - who has headed the Government 
through consecutive elections in 1991 , 1998 and 2007 - Bu rk ina Faso has moved towards 
market-oriented reforms and re-engagement with t h e international community. Over the 
last tw o decades, t h e Government has embarked upon a dramatic economic and po l i t ica l 
re fo rm agenda, i n v o l v i n g reforms in liberalization and the improvement o f the investment 
climate, as well as efforts towards decentralized governance. Bu rk ina Faso became one 
o f the f i r s t countries to be eligible fo r the Highly-Indebted Poor Countries In i t ia t ive . 
Po l i t ica l stability and a comm i t ted leadership have enabled B u r k i n a t o achieve steady 
progress o n bo th the economic and social fronts. 

3 . 
BurkinabP national pride continues to be an important driver of change and a 
stimulus for leadership at the regional level. Bu rk ina Faso means “the land o f t h e 

people o f integrity”. Strong national pride has no t on ly created a cohesive society, but i t 
has also engendered a competitive determination in the country t o continuously imp rove 
the nation’s performance vis-&vis 
that o f the region. B u r k i n a Faso has assumed a 
leading ro le at the regional leve l . The country se rves as the host country for the 
headquarters o f the Wes t A f r i c a n Economic and Monetary U n i o n (WAEMU) and in 2007 
President Compaore took upon the presidency o f the organization. The President has also 
been actively engaged in peace-brokering initiatives in neighboring C6te D ’ I v o i r e and 
Togo. 

4. 

Despite progress 

in the 

liberalization of Bu rk ina ’s political economy, 

challenges remain. Democracy has been embraced since the early 1990 ’s with a ser ies 
o f peaceful elections, however the country i s yet to experience p o l i t i c a l alternation and 
opposition remains weak. Bu rk ina Faso’s po l i t ica l system i s characterized by a highly 
centralized state system w h i c h remains deeply rooted in hierarchical traditions. The well- 
organized and professional high l e v e l administration can be contrasted with weak lowe r

system, hampe r ing the effectiveness o f r e f o rm imp lemen ta t ion and the impac t o f p u b l i c 
debate. A general cu l tu re o f t o p - d ow n governance has resulted in societal deference t o 
the exercise o f state au tho r i ty . W h i l e soc ia l accoun tab i l i ty has been re in fo r ced by regu la r 
elections, the high leve ls o f i l l i te racy , adhesion t o t rad i t iona l concepts o f hierarchy, and 
the l o w capacity o f c i v i l society and the independent med ia limit the effectiveness o f 
independent re f lec t ion o n government functions. The State’s dependence o n dono r 
f inanc ing also causes d is to r t ions in accountability. Greater a t ten t ion i s o f t e n g i v e n t o 
donor demands, lead ing t o a focus o n the development o f h ighe r l e v e l po l ic ies rather than 
p o l i c y imp lemen ta t ion at the grass-roots leve l . 

5 . 

Rising social u n r e s t in recent times, i n v o l v i n g r io ts over p r i c e increases t o basic 
foodstuffs, na t iona l strikes ove r salaries, student protests ove r p o o r p a y and sporadic 
protests by the military and p o l i c e forces have caused in te rna l turbulence within the 
ruling party and ma rked a shift towa rds an inc reas ing ly voc i fe rous pub l ic . A n e w P r im e

t o strengthen r e f o rm in i t ia t ives with pa r t icu la r focus o n governance and pa r t ic ipa t ion . 
Desp i te c i v i l un res t in ea r ly 2008, the Reg ime appears t o con t inue t o en joy a re la t ive ly 
high l e v e l o f p o l i t i c a l leg i t imacy . There i s speculation that President Compaore w i l l 
stand aga in f o r elections in 20 10 w h i c h w o u l d be l e g a l l y possible under the Cons t i tu t ion . 

B. 

THE ECONOMY 

R e c e n t E c o n om i c D e v e l o pm e n t s 

6. 
Structural reforms, sound macroeconomic policies and steady 
investment 
enabled Burkina to sustain significant growth rates and maintain relative macro- 
economic stability over the decade preceding 2007, however the economy’s narrow

performance. C o t t o n exports fo rmed the basis o f Bu rk ina ’s high GDP g r ow t h rates

The impact of exogenous shocks was particularly significant in the last few 
years. L o w co t ton prices, comb ined with the dep rec ia t ion o f the do l la r against the euro, a 
s ign i f ican t d rop in co t ton p roduc t ion f r o m i r regu la r r a i n f a l l and r i s i n g f o o d and f u e l

of the r is ing international o i l and food p r ices . The fa l l ing cotton exports2 on ly pa r t ly 
offset b y gold exports, coupled with the increased cost o f food and energy imports, also 
led to the widening o f the current account d e f i c i t (including grants) f r om 8.3 percent o f 
GDP in 2007 to 11 percent o f GDP in 2008. 

8. 
Despite significant shocks, in the past two years the overall fiscal deficit has 
averaged 4.6 percent of GDP, mainly financed by official assistance. Public 
expenditure in 2008 was reduced f rom 25.8 percent to 22 percent o f GDP, in l i n e with the 
spending exercised in 2004/2005 p r io r to the f i r s t cotton c r i s i s in 2006/2007. Fiscal 
po l icy has been broadly in l i n e with the targets set under the authorities program, as 
confirmed b y the successful completion o f the third review under the IMF PRGF 
Arrangement in December 2008. Starting f r om a l o w tax base and through the approval 
o f the tax po l icy strategy o n October 1, 2008, the Government has placed significant 
emphasis on continued improvement in tax administration to raise domestic revenue 
fu r the r and limit external financing on credit te rms . The tax po l i cy strategy includes a 
combination o f measures t o rationalize fiscal incentives, s imp l i fy and modernize the legal 
framework, improve the oversight and r e t u r n o f indirect taxes, and effectively tax the 
in fo rma l sector in urban areas. 

9 . 

Fiscal policy did not Significantly crowd out private sector activity despite 
annual subsidies to the cotton sector and the 2007 recapitalization of certain cotton 
companies. Credit to the private sector has increased significantly o n a cumulative basis 
since 2004, bo th in real terms (by about 30 percent) and as a share o f GDP. Access t o 
credit fo r small and medium sized en te rp r ises (SME) was facilitated by a new financial 
ins t i tu t ion responsible fo r guaranteeing inter-bank credit, which was se t up in 2007, as 
well as an expansion o f credits provided by the Na t iona l Microfinance Ins t i tu t ion 
(S’stdrne Financier De‘centralise‘, or SFD). Also, the issuance o f land t i t l e s in 2006-2007 
has facilitated the collateralization o f loans, imp rov ing the quality o f guarantees.

The global f inanc ia l crisis is negatively affecting Burkina’s growth and fiscal 
performance. A l though the country has been r e s i l i e n t to the impact o f the financial crisis 
due to limited cross-border linkages in i t s banking system, the economic outlook has 
worsened as the lagged effects on the real activity a re feeding through the economy. 
Dramatic reduction in cotton export p r ices and lower demand are the ma in transmission 
mechanisms, although lowe r o i l and h i g h go ld p r i c e s are pa r t ly offsetting them. The 
lower global g row th and the decline in domestic cotton p r ices (a drop o f over 40 percent 
in the world’s reference price) have significantly affected the p ro f i tab i l i ty o f ginning 
companies, placed pressure on government finances and risk causing a drastic cut in 
production by small cotton f a rm e r s potentially leading to a significant increase in 
poverty. W i t h the tightening o f credit conditions, foreign direct investment i s also

The re are significant downside risks deriving f rom a deeper or longer than

impact o n the fiscal balance o f 0.1 percent o f GDP.6 Also, the banking system could be 
negatively affected b y r i s ing nonperforming loans as the economy slows, with significant 
exposure to the cotton sector. The overall fiscal impact wou ld be even more significant 
(up to 0.6 percent o f GDP) i f the Government had to recapitalize the cotton companies. 
Uncertainty on o i l price projections constitutes another significant downward risk fo r the 
macroeconomic framework. A permanent increase o f 20 percent in o i l prices f rom the 
current macroeconomic framework7 wou ld resu l t in a deterioration o f the c u r r e n t account 
d e f i c i t by 0.8 percent o f GDP o n average during the projection pe r iod (2009-2011), 
corresponding to a financing gap o f US$54 m i l l i o n in 2009 and o f US$66 m i l l i o n per 
year, on average, over the three-year projection period. 

14. A number of factors could help to mitigate these down-side risks. The impact o f 

l o w prices on cotton producers w i l l be spread over time b y the cotton smoothing fund - 
provided i t i s sufficiently capitalized - while new productivity investments in agriculture 
wou ld continue to sustain growth. Over the medium te rm , as producer prices adjust to 
l o w wo r ld prices, i t i s likely that more producers w i l l stop the production o f cotton. This 
could have a negative impact o n GDP, exports, poverty and other macro and m ic ro 
indicators o f the economy. But Government efforts to diversify and develop agricultural 
value chains wou ld help producers reallocate their resources to other profitable products. 
This adjustment wou ld thus mitigate the effects associated w i t h the reduction o f cotton 
prices, and could have the advantage o f enhancing food production and, therefore, food 
secu r i ty . Ongoing improvements in revenue mob i l iza t ion and pub l ic financial 
management a re also expected to help improve the fiscal balance and efficiency o f pub l ic 
spending. In parallel, the Government intends to develop be t ter targeted social safety 
ne ts with technical assistance f r om IDA to mitigate the impact o f the crisis on the 
poorest, inc lud ing through: (i) monetary t ran s fe rs (conditional or not); (ii) food 
distribution programs; (iii) school feeding programs; (iv) labor intensive pub l ic works; 
(v) general subsidies ( food and fuel); and (vi) exemptions to pay fees fo r basic se rv ice s 
(health and education). In order to closely monitor the emerging impact o f the crisis, the 
Government has established a special Consultation Framework (Cadre de Concertation) 
to regroup stakeholders in the cotton sector and donors behind a common mon i to r ing 
process. The ongoing Household Budget Survey w i l l also strengthen mon i to r ing o f the 
social impact o f the crisis.

Poverty 

16. 
The recent series of exogenous shocks have reversed six years of progress i n 
poverty reduction and a further deterioration is possible if the impact of 
the ongoing 
global crisis worsens. G o o d economic g r ow t h and increased inves tmen ts in soc ia l 
services resulted in a dec l ine in the incidence o f pove r t y be tween 2004 and 2006, with the 
p r o p o r t i o n o f the p o p u l a t i o n living b e l ow the pove r t y l i n e f a l l i n g f r o m 46.3 percent t o

17. 
Bu rk ina ’s poverty profile shows that ru r a l populations, particularly households 
headed by women, are worst-affected and tha t food insecurity is chronic and regionally 
variable. Poverty remains a predominantly ru ra l phenomenon in Bu rk ina with the 
proportion o f poor people l i v i n g in the countryside increasing f rom 92.2 percent in 2003 
to 93 pe rcen t in 2005 to 94.1 percent in 2007. Household s u r v e y s conducted in 2003, 
2005 and 2007 revealed a close nexus between risk exposure, vulnerability and poverty in 
ru ra l areas. Households are vulnerable to agro-climatic and price fluctuations and are 
incapable o f regulating or insuring consumption l e v e l s during periods o f revenue 
fluctuation. Like many Sahe l ian countries, the North-Eastern regions (Sahel, Central 
N o r t h and East) are particularly vulnerable to climatic shocks because o f their l o w 
accumulation o f assets. A l though monetary and asset-based poverty does not appear to 
be significantly higher in households headed b y women, these households experience a 
higher nationwide incidence o f the worst fo rm o f poverty because they are much more 
exposed to food insecurity risks.12 Chronic food insecurity, wh ich affected 3 8 percen t o f 
households in 2007, remains a concern. 

Human Development 

18. 

Increased pub l ic expenditures and targeted social service provision have led to 
improved access to basic services. Government spending o n education, health and 
potable water and sanitation have generally r i s e n steadily (Figure 1) and access to 
education and water, in particular, have increased. Gross enrollment rates in primary 
schools have increased f rom 41.7 percent in 1999-2000 to 72 percent in 2007. The 
enrolment rate in secondary schools has r i s e n f r om 19.1 percent in 2005 to 27.4 percen t 
in 2008. Overall access to d r ink ing water has improved to 79 percent in 2007 f rom 54 
percent in 2004 with more modest gains in ru ra l areas. In health, access to services has 
also improved with subsidies fo r obstetrical emergency care and delivery se rv ice s and 
gratuity fo r a l l preventive services at the p r ima ry health care level. Infant mortality rates 
are s low ly fa l l ing as a r e s u l t o f improved access to ante and post natal care by qualified 
health personnel and better management o f integrated childhood i l lnesses . HIV/AIDs 
prevalence has decreased f rom 7.17 percent in 1997 to 1.9 percent in 2008 in the adult 
(15 - 49 age group) p ~ p u l a t i o n ’ ~ . These indicators are reflected in improvements to 
Burkina’s Human Development Index wh ich has r i s e n from 0.259 in 1980 to 0.372 in 
2008, with a re la t ive ly h i g h positive change ratio o f 0.055 over the pe r iod 2000-2006.

l2 In 2003, t h r e e in five (60percent) o f households headed by women were confronted with a food 
insecurity problem, compared to l e s s than one in two (49percent) for male-headed households. In 2007, the 
figures were 47percent for women-headed households, against 37percent for males. 
The decline in prevalence can partially be attributed to the following: “In 2007, advances in the 
methodology o f estimations o f H IV epidemics applied to an expanded range o f country data have resulted 
in substantial changes in estimates o f numbers o f persons living with H IV worldwide”: 2007 AIDS

Despite progress, Bu rk ina maintains a comparatively low ranking of 173 out of 
1 7 9 countries in the UNDP Human Development Index and is unlikely to reach several 

MDG ’ s by 2015. W h i l e Bu rk ina Faso i s o n track t o reach the MDG targets fo r access to 
primary education, potable water and reduced H IV prevalence, significant challenges 
exist with respect to attaining the r e s t o f the MDGs, in particular those related t o maternal 
and infant mortality. Mo r ta l i ty figures remain alarming with very h i g h infant and 
juvenile mortality, respectively at 104 per 1,000 and 191 per 1,000 in 2007. O f particular 
concern i s the deterioration in ma lnu t r i t ion rates over the last decade. Bu rk ina also 
compares l e s s favorably than other countries fo r assisted births despite efforts to improve 
health provision. The worsening global crisis i s likely to have a negative impact on the 
availability o f pub l ic resources fo r basic services and Burkina’s progress towards 
attaining the MDG’s.

Burkina’s unbridledpopulation growth rate of 3.1 percent represents one of the 
greatest obstacles to human development and poverty reduction. Recent studies, 

inc lud ing the upcoming Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) and the Na t iona l 
Te r r i to r ia l Planning Study (Etude du Schema N a t i o n a l d ’Amenagement du T e r r i t o i r e or 
SNAT) diagnostic, have identified the serious repercussions o f a population g row th that 
i s driven by h i g h fertility in Burkina. Burkina’s population g row th rate no t on ly 
jeopardizes the p rov is ion o f human capital investments, especially in the areas o f 
education and health, i t also heightens food insecurity, hastens land saturation and 
environmental degradation and, in the longer term , the expanded population o f youth w i l l 
place a strain on the already l im i ted formal labor market. The phenomenal population 
increase renders attainment o f the MDGs less l ike ly and more costly and i t has a direct 
impact o n the poverty headcount.

111. BURKINA FASO’S M A I N DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES AND 
OPPORTUNITIES 

21. 
The strong performance o f the country at a macro leve l and in key sectors, the 
important growth potential that ex is ts and the stable po l i t ica l environment in wh ich 
imp rov ing governance and accountability have recently assumed particular prominence 
provide a solid foundation fo r transformation in Bu rk ina Faso. In order to harness this 
opportunity, Bu rk ina faces tw o ma in development challenges: 

(i) 
(ii) 

Sustaining the country’s positive growth trajectory; and 
Advancing human development through the improved delivery o f social 
services. 

Governance remains a central component o f bo th development challenges. Population 
growth, environmental degradation and climate change have an aggravating impact on 
these development challenges and are therefore integrally relevant. 

Development Challenge 1: Sustaining the country’s positive growth trajectory 

22. 
I n a difficult international context, the country faces 
the challenge of 
sustaining its positive growth trajectory through intensification and diversification of 
the economy. The upcoming CEM indicates that the growth effects o f Burkina’s 
currency liberalization in 1994 are nearly exhausted. The impact o f the global financial 
crisis also threatens to slow economic growth. Bu rk ina can no longer a f fo rd to 
precariously balance o n the undulating performance o f the cotton sector, wh ich renders 
the economy vulnerable to climatic shocks and fluctuations in international commodity 
prices. The country needs to overcome i t s economic vulnerability and develop a broader 
and more sustainable resource base through intensification and diversification o f the 
economy. 

(i) Opportunities 

23. 
The cotton sector is, and w i l l remain, a vital element of Burkina’s economy in 
the short to medium term and efforts 
to improve the productivity and viability of 
the 
sector are critical. Bu rk ina Faso i s Sub-Saharan Africa’s biggest cotton producer w i t h 
unprocessed cotton accounting fo r above h a l f (in good years) to above a third (in bad 
years) o f exports. The sector provides 700,000 jobs, employs 17 percent o f the 
population and constitutes the on ly source o f cash revenue fo r many fa rme r s . The cotton 
sector i s at once Burkina’s success story and her A c h i l l e s hee l . Reforms in the cotton 
sector have produced a model fo r integrated supply chain development and have resu l ted 
in significant growth in the sector. F rom 1995/96 t o 2005/06 cotton production increased 
b y 17 percent a year in Burkina, against 2.1 percent a year globally. However, h i g h 
commodity price volatility, l o w p roduc t iv i ty and the sector’s vulnerability to climatic 
shocks have resulted in l o w and unstable income generation and poor land management 
associated with cotton production has hastened environmental degradation. The 

10 

unfolding cotton c r i s i s has revealed the c r i t ica l importance o f imp rov ing productivity, 
establishing reliable risk management mechanisms and support structures fo r producers 
and advancing structural reforms to improve the sector’s competitiveness and v iab i l i ty . 
W h i l e there are gains to be made in imp rov ing the cotton sector’s performance, 
ultimately over-reliance o n the sector for economic g row th i s bo th risky and 
unsustainable. 

24. 
Economic diversification outside of 
the cotton sector is paramount to reducing 
vulnerability, enhancing export performance and ensuring sustainable growth in the 
medium to longer t e rm Bu rk ina Faso’s l o w income l e v e l and small internal market 
makes i t dependent upon exports fo r growth. Yet the country’s 9.6 percent export rate 
between 1998 and 2004 was the worst o f a l l WAEMU countries and f e l l well be low the 
average regional rate o f 30.8 percent. Bu rk ina Faso’s limited export earnings are due in 
large part to i t s failure t o develop non-cotton sectors. W h i l e diversification i s no t a new 
concept in Bu rk ina Faso, until recently, i t has been approached na r row ly f r om an 
agricultural p roduc t iv i ty perspective with limited focus a n post-production issues such as 
market access and export promotion. 
Initiatives have been fragmented and, lately, 
sidelined by the focus o n resurrecting the cotton sector in the wake o f the cotton crises. 
As a result, the country has achieved l i t t l e progress in d ive rs i fy ing i t s economy. The 
challenge fo r Bu rk ina Faso i s to begin to develop key areas o f g row th and export 
potential in an integrated manner, focusing on strengthening identified income-enhancing 
products fo r which Bu rk ina has a comparative advantage and simultaneously overcoming 
barriers to production, private sector engagement and trade. 
In recognition o f this 
challenge, the Government i s n ow committed to concentrate scarce pub l ic investment 
resources in a few geographical areas that exhibit large g row th potential. 

25. 
I n the medium term, agriculture (including livestock and agro-processing) is 
the most obvious source of growth and poverty reduction in Bu rk ina Faso. The 
agriculture sector employs over 80 percent o f the population and contributes to 40 
percent o f national GDP. Between 2001 and 2008, g row th in agriculture exceeded the 
national average desp i te year to year fluctuations. However, agricultural g row th over the 
past decade has predominantly r e l i e d upon area expansion, a practice that cannot be 
sustained due to fast-approaching spatial saturation, rap id population g row th and land 
degradation. Productivity has remained stagnant. Subsistence fa rm ing i s widespread, 
with limited access o f producers to bo th internal and external markets and m in ima l 
involvement o f agribusinesses in the sector. Environmental degradation and climate 
change have had particularly ravaging effects on the performance o f the sector. To 
harness the potential o f the agriculture sector, two key challenges ex is t . First, there i s a 
need to in tens i fy agricultural p roduc t iv i ty (including livestock feed) b y imp rov ing 
development, distribution and access to yield enhancing technologies, enhancing natural 
resource and risk management and strengthening land tenure. This w i l l enable Bu rk ina 
Faso t o develop i t s domestic market, thereby achieving food security and reducing the 
country’s dependency o n food imports in a time o f global recession. I t w i l l also create 
the necessary conditions fo r a shift f r om subsistence farming to diversification in to h igh 
income-enhancing agriculture. Second, there i s a need t o commercialize h i g h value 

11 

agriculture products16 by developing t igh t ly integrated and efficient agricultural supply 
chains geared towards regional export markets and by harnessing the value-adding 
potential o f agro-processing. 

26. 
M i n i n g is a key driver of diversijication and growth. M ine ra l resources are 
emerging as important export commodities in Burkina. Government reforms in the 
m in ing sector, inc lud ing a modem m in ing code in 2003, have already attracted important 
foreign d i rec t investments, notably in gold m in ing exploration. Expo r t earnings f rom 
go ld m in ing rose f r om 16.1 b i l l i o n CFAF in 2007 to 85 .O b i l l i o n CFAF in 2009. There 
are currently four producing gold mines and th ree under construction and the sector 
generated 3,350 jobs in 2008. The geographic dispersion o f mineral deposits i s well 
spread across the country, and could p lay an important ro le in developing ru ra l 
economies. W h i l e the global economic c r i s i s may s l igh t ly dampen the prospects fo r 
expansion o f t h e sector in t h e near t e r m due t o uncertain commodity prices and likely 
lower FDI, a supportive institutional framework needs to be developed to pave the way 
for diversification towards scaled up mineral exploitation in the short to medium terrn.17 
Active engagement on governance and capacity bu i ld ing a re c r i t ica l to developing the 
potential o f the sector. Reducing factor costs, enhancing the investment climate and 
engaging SME's linked to the m in ing sector w i l l likely attract further foreign direct 
investment. Administrative capacity within the Ministry o f Quarries, Mines and Energy 
and government oversight o f the extractive industries wou ld also strengthen the g row th 
potential o f the sector. The Government has started by developing a ministerial staffing 
strategy, establishing an anti-fraud commission to track go ld mined at an artisanal leve l 
and participating in the Extractive Industries Transparency In i t ia t ive (EITI). 

( i i ) Obstacles 

27. 
Despite improvements to the investment climate, Bu rk ina faces an ongoing 
challenge to attract strong private sector involvement and foreign direct investment. 
The country achieved significant progress in im rov ing i t s investment climate" and 
supporting domestic private sector development. Comparatively, however, Bu rk ina 
Faso s t i l l ranks poo r ly in the D o i n g Bus iness indicators (148 out o f 181 countries) and 
the upcoming C E M iden t i f ies a decline in the investment g row th rate f rom 2.6 percent 
between 1994 and 1999 to 1.6 percent between 2000 and 2006, w i t h further reductions 
possible in the wake o f the global financial c r i s is . Private sector participation in the 
economy i s weakened b y the l o w capacity o f domestic SMEs and the limited availability

as livestock, leather, meat, cashew, sesame, shea butter, dried mangoes and horticulture: CEM .

E.g. reforms to reduce labor market r ig id i ty allowed Burk ina to become the w o r l d top reformer in the 
labor regulation indicator. Burk ina Faso's ranking improved from 125/18 1 in 2008 to 57/181 in 2009; and 
Parliament passed the Na t iona l Po l icy for Rural Land Tenure in June 2009 and the Millennium Challenge 
Account (MCA) has committed significant financing to assist w i t h the implementation o f the policy.

of tailored financial services2’. Acute s k i l l s deficits in key areas o f economic g row th also 
significantly constrain private sector investment and performance. Acceleration o f the 
investment climate re fo rm agenda i s c r i t ica l and w i l l need t o focus particularly on the 
State’s continued intervention in the market through regulated parastatals, procedures fo r 
protecting property rights, and the creation o f a legal framework to provide certainty t o 
potential investors on the responsibilities and risk sharing arrangements in pub l ic private 
partnerships. The loca l private sector also requ i res further capacity development support 
(particularly in accessing finance). The Government’s financial sector strategy aims to 
address improvements to financial intermediation and access to finance to support the 
private sector l e d g row th agenda (particularly SME, rural, housing and long-term 
financing). Finally, as identified by a ser ies o f recent analyses21, a clear strategy t o target 
c r i t ica l s k i l l s deficits within the labor market w i l l accelerate g row th in key areas and 
improve the employment prospects o f youths in particular. 

28. 

Limited access, unreliability and high cos& associated with economic 
infrastructure represent major obstacles to private sector investment and economic 
competitiveness. In energy, Bu rk ina stands to benefit f i o m access to additional capacity 
at a much lower price f r om neighboring countries, under the regional West A f r ican 
Power Poo l (WAPP), inc lud ing connections with C6te D ’ I vo i re (due fo r completion in 
2010) and with Ghana (expected to commence in 2011). W h i l e the se connections are 
vital, there i s also a clear need for: (i) a sustainable national strategy on energy wh ich 
addresses, on the demand side, the role o f private sector participation in the state-owned 
utility, SONABEL , and, on the supply side, the rationalization o f p r ic ing systems fo r 
energy products and services to promote efficiency and industrial development; and (ii) 
fo r imp roved ru ra l and peri-urban access to renewable and sustainable energy sources. 

29. 
In transport, lack o f territorial access to the sea, limited farm to market ru ra l road 
access, road maintenance and h igh transport and t r a n s i t costs are ma jo r constraints. The 
road network, wh i ch forms the ma in basis o f external and internal transportation in 
Bu rk ina i s generally in a good condition22, however, a sustainable strategy to ensure 
adequate ongoing finance for road maintenance remains a p r io r i ty . . The absence o f 
competition in the t ruck ing industry, wh ich i s operated on a cartel-type rotational basis 
fo r a l l operators, i s the most significant contributor to h i g h transport costs in Bu rk ina and 
needs t o be addressed at a regional level. Desp i te the rev iva l o f corridors with Togo, 
Ghana and Benin in the wake o f the crisis in CBte D’Ivoire, Bu rk ina s t i l l r a n k s poo r ly for 
trading across borders.23 Trading across borders cou ld be further improved with customs 
re fo rm and better infrastructure in external ports. M o d a l diversification away f r om over-

represent promising options fo r landlocked Burkina. A key future challenge w i l l be to 
attract r a i l and airport investments through public-private partnerships. In the context o f 
in fo rma t ion and communication technologies (ICT), access to se rv ices i s l o d 5 and costs 
remain h i g h despite significant progress in the sector.26 The challenge mo v ing forward i s

the creation o f a more favorable operating environment fo r mob i le phone operators. 
Possible regional SAT3 interconnections also provide promising opportunities in the 
sector. 

3 0. 
Comprehensive regional integration remains critical to overcoming Bu rk ina 
Faso’s small size and landlocked position.. The country stands to benefit f rom regional 
actions in the context o f an integrated and open West A f r ica economic space under the 
auspices o f WAEMU, the Economic Community o f West A f r ican States (ECOWAS) and 
other cooperative initiatives. Through the WAPP, Bu rk ina w i l l gain access t o regional 
power supplies, significantly reducing e lec t r ic i ty costs and p rov id ing opportunities fo r 
improved regional I C T connections using the same transmission l ines . Other important 
regional initiatives w i l l r e s u l t in improved financial intermediation, transparent m in ing 
operations, the establishment o f regional risk management and m i t iga t ion mechanisms 
and improved cross-border transport and trade through road rehabilitation, customs 
re fo rm and improved access to regional ports. The challenge w i l l be t o continue the 
momentum o f these initiatives and promote new engagements. E f fo r ts to pro-actively 
broach regional issues related to f ree trade, improved t rans fe r o f technologies, innovation 
and south-south learning w i l l also be critical. 

Development Challenge 2: Advancing human development through social service 
delivery 

3 1. 
Broad-based public service delivery represents the most effective means of re- 
distributing the benefits of growth and advancing human development in Bu rk ina 
Faso28. However, pub l ic expenditure on social services remains comparatively l o w in 
Bu rk ina Faso, representing on ly 5.6 percent o f GDP. G iven the narrow fiscal space to 
increase pub l ic expenditures (w i th l o w tax revenues and weaker short-term prospects fo r 
economic growth and a id flows), the challenge fo r Bu rk ina Faso w i l l be to maximize the 
effectiveness o f the limited resources available in p rov id ing quality social services. This

w i l l be particularly relevant in the context o f the ongoing process towards decentralized 
social service delivery in Burkina. The specific challenges t o delivery o f quality social 
services relate to: (i) the effectiveness and governance o f state institutions operating in a 
decentralized system; (ii) pub l ic demand and oversight o f service delivery and; (iii) 
particular areas o f concern in social serv ices . 

Effectiveness and governance of state institutions 

32. 
Despite demonstrated commitment on the part of 
the Government to promote 
better governance, important challenges remain in strengthening the quality of public 
administration and accountability. Bu rk ina compares favorably to the A f r ican average 
and Sub-Saharan A f r i c a average fo r the six Governance Indicators constructed by 
K a u h a n n and Kraay. In 2008 the Governance Indicators on regulatory quality and 
corruption improved. The Prime Minister has put t h e f igh t against corruption at the top 
o f the agenda and a new Higher Administrative Control Au tho r i ty (Autorite‘ Supe‘rieure 
de ContrGZe de Z’Etat or ASCE), in charge o f promoting anti-corruption, i s already 
operational. However, accountability, government effectiveness and r u l e o f law remain 
at issue, having declined in the Governance Indicators fo r 2008.

Public financial management has undergone positive changes; yet there is still 
room for improvement. The Government i s implementing a w ide range o f pub l ic

2015 (Strate‘gie de Renforcement des Finance PubZiques o r SRFP). The SRFP aims to 
create a performance-based P F M system by 2015 within the context o f the new P F M

economic frameworks, and fewer expenditure deviations. The creation o f an independent 
Court o f Accounts has enabled t ime ly and increasingly professional auditing o f 
government accounts. Progress has also been achieved in enhancing the transparency o f 
procurement procedures. However, remaining challenges include imp rov ing the 
implementation o f procurement and financial management reforms, rationalizing P F M 
controls and developing the capacity o f control institutions, inc lud ing parliament. 

34. 

Public administration, though generally well-structured, lacks efficiency due to 
cumbersome procedures, unresponsiveness and weak capacity. C i v i l service reforms 

that were introduced in 1998 to improve efficiency are s low ly being implemented, 
however reforms a re yet to reflect the shift towards decentralization in Bu rk ina - 
incentive and accountability structures remain poo r ly aligned and there i s no local c i v i l 
service. Limited accountability and capacity and resource constraints also impact upon 
the effectiveness o f c i v i l service performance. A l though a nationwide capacity 
development po l icy has been created, i t i s yet to be operationalized. Capacity- 
development w i t h i n the pub l ic administration wou ld significantly benefit f rom better 
coordination. The statistical capacity o f the administration also needs to be strengthened 
to improve mon i to r ing and evaluation. 

I n Burkina Faso, the decentralization agenda i s central to improving public 

35. 
service delivery. There i s broad agreement in the country that the quality o f services w i l l 
no t improve until accountability fo r service p rov is ion i s shifted to the communal leve l 
where most o f the actual delivery o f services takes place. The General Loca l 
Governments Code 2 0 0 4 (Code General Des Collectivitks Territoriales) confers 
responsibility fo r primary se rv ice delivery on the loca l municipalities in Bu rk ina Faso. 
To date t h e ab i l i ty o f municipalities to carry out their mandates has been hampered by 
slow implementation o f the decentralization agenda (see B o x 1). An analysis o f 
decentralization in 2007 identified key challenges to the process. At the central level, the 
level o f autonomy with wh ich communes a re expected t o operate has yet to be clearly 
elucidated and this has constrained efforts to operationalize the legal t rans fe r o f 
responsibilities. In addition, the complex set o f decentralization and de-concentration 
s t ruc tu res requ i res further rationalization and the mechanisms for intergovernmental 
t rans fe rs need to be c la r i f ied to ensure appropriate, regular and transparent resource 
trans fers to the communes. At the commune level, limited basic capacity in planning and 
budget management constitutes a major obstacle. Loca l revenue collection and adequate 
staffing also need t o be addressed. 
Improved donor coordination around the 
decentralization agenda poses an additional challenge for the Government. 

Public demand for and oversight of quality service delivery 

36. 

Citizen, civil society, parliamentary and media participation as a means of 
bridging the accountability gap and strengthening the demand-side for transparent and 
quality public service delivery is yet to be fully exploited. H i g h levels o f i l l i te racy and 

management; and (iv) improved budget reporting and auditing with the introduction o f an independent 
Audit Court.

societal deference to traditional hierarchies have resulted in a weak c i t izen “voice” and 
l o w commun i ty participation in decision-making and oversight. A po l i t ica l economy 
analysis conducted in 2008 highlighted that c i v i l society and the media are constrained by 
weak capacity, limited access to in fo rma t ion and few opportunities fo r real engagement

I n education, the issues of 
literacy and educational quality continue to 
constitute a cause for concern. T h e Government has been proactive in increasing access 
to education, targeting the most deprived regions and focusing o n ra is ing female 
education rates. Yet the country maintains one o f the lowest literacy rates in the w o r l d 
(below 30 percent) and the quality o f education i s negatively affected by inadequate 
teaching resources. The challenge w i l l be to ensure that educational qua l i ty i s no t 
compromised b y increasing access t o education or b y sh i f t ing service delivery 
responsibilities to the communes.

3 8 . 
I n health, the coverage and quality of services remain priorities, while the 
momentum on tackling malaria, H I V / A I D S and epidemic diseases needs to be 
maintained. Under the ten-year health sector program adopted in 2001, access has 
improved with activities including: (i) the construction o f health facilities; (ii) f ree 
preventive services for children and f ree prenatal care; (iii) expanded coverage o f 
preventive and curative health services, with the percentage o f children fully vaccinated 
increasing f r om 22 percent f rom 2004 to 44 percent in 2006; and (iv) the introduction o f a 
distribution system fo r essential drugs. However, the country continues to register h i g h 
rates o f unassisted de l ive r ies and maternal mortalities, coverage i s s t i l l insufficient and 
health facilities remain under-equipped and poo r ly staffed. Given the h i g h mo r ta l i ty rates 
in Burkina, the steady progress in stabilizing and reducing H IV prevalence needs to be 
sustained30, as do the improved vaccination coverage rates fo r tuberculosis, meningitis 
and measles and the malaria prevention and treatment campaigns. Ma la r ia remains the 
primary cause o f infant mo r ta l i ty and mo rb id i ty in Burkina. The Ministry o f Hea l th has 
finalized a new fully costed malaria strategy, and has agreed to strengthen district-level 
planning tools to better a l ign activities with the disease burden, as well as to develop an 
integrated approach to community-level 
interventions 
fo r malaria, 
tuberculosis, 
HIV/AIDS , reproductive health, and malnutrition. 

3 9 . 
Nutrition has also become a primary health concern. Ma lnu t r i t ion rates have 
fluctuated and worsened in the last decade, with chronic ch i ld ma lnu t r i t ion reaching 3 5 . 9 
percent in 2007. Ma lnu t r i t ion impacts upon the h i g h infant mo r ta l i ty rate in Burkina, 
accounting fo r 50 percent o f deaths o f children under five. A l though on average overall 
food production in Bu rk ina Faso appears to match consumption needs, food storage, 
access and diet quality are important underlying factors in the r is ing levels o f 
malnutrition. A national nu t r i t ion strategy exists and intersectoral coordination 
mechanisms have been instituted, however, interventions w i l l need to be sustained and 
further scaled up to deal with the impending ma lnu t r i t ion c r is is . 

40. 
Despite significant improvements to urban access to water, disparities in ru ra l 
coverage and sanitation require greater focus. The Government has made particularly 
noteworthy progress in imp rov ing access to potable water w i t h the development o f the 
National Water Supply and Sanitation Program (PN-AEPA), improved pub l ic u t i l i t y 
efficiency, an ambitious and successful urban extension program and t h e development o f 
public-private partnerships between communities and the loca l private sector. Wh i le 
access in urban areas has increased significantly, the national program i s focused on 
addressing the ongoing challenge o f disparities in ru ra l coverage and the development 
and implementation o f sanitation programs.

Social safety net programs are of particular importance in the current context. 
The extent o f h i g h vulnerability amongst the population has increased the demand for

social safety net measures. A significant challenge w i l l be to address the unsustainability 
and ad hoc nature o f existing pub l ic safety ne t programs, wh ich rely almost exclusively 
on external funding. The preparation o f a Na t iona l Social Protection Strategy, a l aw on 
social protection and a ten-year implementation plan demonstrate the Government’s 
commitment. 

The Centrality o f Governance to Burkina Faso’s Development Challenges 

42. 
Good governance remains an important undercurrent to tackling Burkina’s 
fundamental development challenges. 

The Government has signaled a clear 
commitment to improve the ‘governance’ environment fo r economic g row th through 
regulatory and institutional reform, with demonstrable progress in investment climate 
reforms, private sector development and land tenu re policies. Yet specific governance 
constraints remain in particular growth sectors. By contrast, governance remains a 
b ind ing constraint to effective and efficient social service delivery and human 
development in the country and i t i s in this context that emphasis on imp rov ing 
governance i s particularly critical. Such an emphasis w i l l be facilitated by the recent 
commitment f rom Government t o strengthen institutions and create greater space fo r 
pub l ic participation. Appendix H provides a preliminary overview o f the governance 
r i s k s in each sector. 

The Aggravating Impact o f Population Growth and Environmental Degradation on 
Burkina Faso’s Development Challenges 

43. 
Urgent efforts 
to trigger a decline in high fertility and slow down the 
unsustainable rate of population growth are called for. Burkina’s h i g h f e r t i l i t y rates 

and expanding population substantially slow the rate o f economic g row th in the country 
and m in im ize the impact o f poverty-reducing and human development initiatives. 
Em ig ra t ion can no longer be r e l i e d upon t o alleviate population pressure , as i t has done in 
the past, due to the recent decline in out-migration and the phenomenon o f r e t u r n - 
migration. In the past, demography received limited attention at a national leve l and the 
coordination o f activities su f fe red f rom a timid Na t iona l Population Po l icy and weak 
institutional capacity. The complexities o f cultural, social and religious constraints to 
population control and family planning have yet to be f u l l y explored but continue to 
ex is t . However, since 2008, and with the completion o f the SNAT diagnostic and the 
recent census, the Government has taken an increasingly pro-active stance, elevating 
demography as a ma jo r development challenge. To achieve a decline in f e r t i l i t y , h i g h 
l e v e l support fo r population coordination activities i s needed, in addition to a nation-wide 
advocacy and communication effort, expanded reproductive health activities (wh ich 
address related se rv ice delivery constraints) and the p romo t ion o f modern contraceptive 
usage. 3 1 

3 1 The C E M indicates tha t 29percent o f Bu rk inabe women have expressed an ‘unme t need’ f o r f am i l y 
planning, three times the number o f women using m o d em f am i l y planning methods. The ra te o f increase o f 
m o d em contraceptive coverage i s excep t iona l ly s low and w o u l d o n l y reach curren t unme t demand by 2060. 
The C E M recommends an increase in m o d em contraceptive usage o f 1 Spercen t per year. Sa t is fy ing unmet 

19 

44. 
The promotion of women is fundamental to Burkina’s overall development and 
it is also paramount to addressing the demography dilemma. Though gender gaps a re 
closing steadily in health and education, women’s participation in economic activity 
tends to be confined to l o w salary ru ra l and in fo rma l sector activities and Bu rk ina i s 
poo r ly ranked in the UND P gender-related development index to HDI ratio32. The 
challenge mov ing fo rwa rd i s to improve women’s involvement in economic activities and 
their autonomy and t o continue to focus on access to health and education services. 

45. 
Burkina’s changing environment has significant ramifications for 
the 
country’s growth prospects and for the quality of 
life of 
the population and requires 
both short term environmental preservation measures and longer term attention to 
climate change. Poor environmental management practices have reduced agricultural 
yields and the population’s access to natural resources. Environmental preservation i s 
further jeopardized by the expansion o f mining. The effects o f climate change are also 
beginning to have a real impact on the country, w i t h desertification and lowered and 
variable ra in fa l l l e v e l s affecting substantial parts o f the country. G iven the immediate 
impact o f environmental degradation on ru ra l populations, short t e rm m i t iga t ion 
measures to improve natural resource management and ensu re that safeguards are built in 
to the expansion o f intensive agriculture and m i n i n g operations ‘are critical. Equally, the 
development o f a coherent and coordinated national disaster risk management strategy 
w i l l strengthen the country’s ab i l i ty to rapidly respond to environmental crises. In the 
longer term, efforts to s tem climate change w i l l be important, inc lud ing through 
regulatory mechanisms to encourage investments in renewable energy and reduce urban 
po l lu t ion and through the exploration o f carbon f inance opportunities.

BURKINA FASO’S VISION 

46. 
Bu rk ina Faso’s long term vision focuses upon human security (economic, 
health, food, environmental, individual and political) and poverty reduction and i s 
encapsulated in the country’s Sustainable Human Development Po l icy o f 1995 and the 
national prospective ‘Bu rk ina 2025’ o f 2001. The long t e r m strategies envisage: regional 
and global integration; sustainable economic growth; increased pub l ic expenditures to 
accelerate human capital development; and strengthened decentralization and 
modernization processes in Government. M o r e recently, the Government-sponsored 
SNAT has mapped a diagnostic o f the country’s development and identified th ree 
fundamental long t e r m strategic objectives: (i) deceleration o f population growth and 
empowerment / advancement o f women; (ii) human capital development; and (iii) 
increased and intensified agricultural production and self-sufficiency, 
(see further 
Appendix E). 

47. 
The country’s medium term strategic vision is being updated. Burkina’s second 
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, the Cadre Stratkgique de Lutte Contre la Pauvrete‘ 

needs for family planning wou ld avert an estimated 240,000 ch i ld deaths and 5,000 maternal deaths b y 
2015. 
3 2 In 2008, 124 o f 154 countries had gender-development to HDI ratios that surpassed that o f Burkina Faso. 

20 

(PRSP) wh i ch i s accompanied by a P r io r i ty A c t i o n Plan fo r 2009-2011, continues to 
guide the country’s medium t e r m development direction, however the Government i s 
n ow in the process o f developing a new Strategy fo r Accelerated G row th and Sustainable 
Development wh ich i s expected to update and supersede the existing PRSP in 201 1. The 
2003 PRSP aims to maintain real GDP growth above 4 percent per annum, halve poverty 
t o 35 percent and increase l i f e expectancy to at least 60 years by 2015. The four pillars 
o f the strategy consist of: (i) raising g row th and equity in a stable macro-economic 
environment t o reduce poverty; (ii) increasing access to and quality o f basic social 
services; (iii) imp rov ing employment and income opportunities fo r the poor; and (iv) 
imp rov ing governance with a particular emphasis o n pub l ic sector management and 
budget management reforms.33 Details o f the proposed new government strategy have 
recently been released in the fo rm o f a concept note (see B o x 2). The CAS aligns support 
behind bo th the existing PRSP and the major areas o f concentration envisaged fo r the 
new government strategy.

BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE STRATEGY 

A. 

IMPLEMENTAT ION OF THE LAST CAS 

48. 
The CAS Completion Report concluded that performance under the last CAS 
was broadly satisfactory 
in supporting the country’s efforts 
towards achieving its 
development outcomes. The Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) ser ies facilitated 
po l icy reforms in the cotton, energy and telecommunications sector, as well as marked 
progress in public financial management. The IFC’s D o i n g Bus iness program was 
instrumental in promoting significant improvements to the investment climate. The CAS 
also contributed to the expansion o f infrastructure networks, inc lud ing regional electricity 
and road interconnections. Through programmatic approaches, gains were achieved in 
imp rov ing access to education, health and urban water. A notable achievement o f CAS 
implementation was the rap id response to the food crisis and meningitis epidemic which 
enabled re-allocated and additional financing fo r extensive seed distribution, school 
feeding programs and vaccinations. Details o f performance under the last CAS a re 
provided in Appendix By the CAS Completion Report. A client survey conducted in 
2008 identified general satisfaction amongst key stakeholders as t o the perfonnance o f 
the W o r l d Bank (see further Appendix I). 

49. 
The fo l low ing key lessons have been incorporated in to the formulation o f the new 
strategy: 

e 

e 

Greater selectivity and inter-sectoral coordination: The 2006 CAS 
aligned support across a l l pillars and outcomes o f the PRSP and invo lved a 
country program o f multiple projects and programs covering most sectors 
and geographical regions. The challenge fo r this strategy i s to enhance the 
impact and visibility o f Bank interventions through a more selective and 
strategic program. This i s particularly relevant in the context o f budget 
support. Wh i le the PRSC se r ies had an effective impact o n central leve l 
reforms inc lud ing pub l ic financial management, they had limited impact: 
(i) where re fo rm implementation depended upon the involvement o f 
particular l i n e ministries and on the capacity o f the Ministry o f Economy 
and Finance to coordinate sectoral reforms; and (ii) in institutional and 
capacity development. Future general budget support wou ld bene f i t f rom 
more selective targeting o f key reforms at the central le ve l . Closer 
cooperation among sectoral teams to harness the complementarities and 
synergies between sectors and projects w i l l also improve the program’s 
coherence and better reflect the interrelated and mutually re in fo rc ing 
nature o f the PRSP objectives to wh ich the CAS aligns. 
Aid effectiveness: Budget support through the PRSC ser ies improved 
donor coordination and proved effective in advancing po l icy dialogue at a 
macro leve l . Programmatic approaches in basic services were successful 
insofar as 
they aligned support behind national sectoral policies. 
However, significant weaknesses in the implementation o f national 
financial management and procurement systems represent ma jo r obstacles 

22 

to the use o f harmonized sectoral approaches and pooled funding 
mechanisms. M o v i n g forward, the W o r l d Bank needs 
to foster 
strengthened donor coordination through continued budget support and 
leadership in key sectors fo r wh ich t h e W o r l d Bank has a comparative 
advantage. Support to strengthen the functioning o f country systems i s 
also critical. 
Target support to local governments. Wh i le donors have supported the 
po l icy o f decentralization, financial assistance has been concentrated at the 
central and community levels, with limited support to the governing 
bodies responsible fo r delivering decentralized services, the communes. 
Through the Community Based Ru ra l Development project (CBRDII), the 
Bank has s tar ted to shift financial support and capacity development f rom 
the village leve l to the ru ra l commune structures. To advance the 
decentralization process and improve service provision, better targeted 
financial and capacity development support at the leve l o f the p rov is ion o f 
decentralized services i s therefore warranted. 
Scale up support to institutional and human capacity development. 
Given the magnitude of the capacity constraints in Bu rk ina and the 
l im i ta t ions they represen t for a id effectiveness, a more consistent and 
mainstreamed approach t o capacity development i s required throughout 
the Bank po r t fo l io as a complement to specific capacity development 
initiatives.

50. 

Current World Bank Group Program: The IDA po r t fo l io in Bu rk ina Faso 
consists o f 14 active projects and the PRSC8 (general budget support) operation with a 
total (gross) commitment o f approximately US$534.88 m i l l i o n . As o f 5 M a y 2009, 
approximately US$294.24 m i l l i o n remains undisbursed. In addition to the annual PRSC 
ser ies , the po r t fo l io includes major investment lending operations in community driven 
development, agricultural diversification, HIV/AIDS, capacity building, electricity (urban 
and rural), transport and private sector promotion. Bu rk ina Faso i s also participating in 
four regional projects34. 28 pe rcen t o f the active po r t fo l io i s allocated to programmatic 
approaches in basic serv ices . 

5 1. 
Overall portfolio performance has been satisfactory. 
The Independent 
Evaluation Group (IEG) ratings o f Bu rk ina Faso projects have shown improvement in the 
last 5 years and have exceeded the average ratings o f the A f i i c a Region. However, recent 
wo r ry ing signs include the leve l o f slow disbursements and the absence o f robust M&E 
systems. 
IEG has also recently drawn attention to t h e fact that the outcomes and 
sustainability ratings have slightly dropped in the last 3 years (FY05-FY08). The country 
team i s currently implementing a po r t fo l io review and action plan to address these 
shortcomings. Project readiness and prompt and e f fec t ive implementation a re strategic 
po r t fo l io priorities under this action plan.

THE PROGRAM OF ASSISTANCE FY 2010 - 2012 

1) 

Strategic Objectives 

’ 53. 
The CAS aligns behind the priorities iden t i f ied in Bu rk ina Faso’s existing PRSP 
and the country’s longer t e r m vision. I t also seeks t o lay the foundations fo r a transition 
towards the new development strategy and a j o i n t donor assistance strategy expected to 
be launched after 201 1. To this end, the strategy w i l l be shorter in duration and w i l l 
culminate in 201 1-2 (FY12). The CAS i s framed around tw o strategic themes and tw o 
cross-cutting issues : 

. 

54. 
Strategic theme one: M in im iz ing economic vulnerability and promoting growth 
through economic transformation. The primary objective o f this strategic theme i s to 
assist Bu rk ina Faso in recovering a strong positive g row th trajectory and m in im iz ing 
economic vulnerability in a time o f global crisis and to prepare fo r a transformation t o an 
in tens i f ied and diversified economy. The substantial part o f the financial assistance w i l l , 
therefore, support the f i r s t and third PRSP pillars relating to g row th and increased 
employment and income generating activities. I t w i l l also support the emerging areas o f 
environmental management and spatial development identified in the concept note fo r the 
Government’s new strategy. 

55 . 
Strategic theme two: Promoting shared growth through improved social service 
delivery. The primary objective o f this strategic theme i s to improve bo th the supply o f 
and demand fo r effective and quality social services by targeting b ind ing governance and 
capacity constraints. Financial assistance w i l l primarily support the second and fou r th 
p i l la rs o f the PRSP relating to improved access to basic social services and p romo t ing 
good governance. I t w i l l also support the increased emphasis on pub l ic participation and 
loca l development outlined in the proposed new government strategy. 

56. 
Cross-cutting issues: Weak institutional and human capacity and rap id population 
g row th represent underlying constraints to bo th strategic themes o f the CAS. 
recognition o f their cross-cutting pertinence, the issues o f (i) governance and capacity 
development and (ii) demography w i l l be addressed through bo th ind iv idua l operations 
captured under the tw o strategic themes and through mainstreaming across the W o r l d 
Bank po r t fo l io . Appendices G and H detail the CAS approach to demography and 
governance and anti-corruption (GAC). These approaches a l ign with the PRSP’s fou r th 
pillar relating to good governance and the proposed new government strategy’s emphasis 
on demography.

Underlying Principles 

57 . 

Transformation. The situation in Bu rk ina Faso calls fo r a transformative CAS . 
A f te r years o f steady g row th and sound economic management, the impact o f the global 
crisis has brought in to focus the importance and urgency o f accelerating diversification o f 
the country’s sources o f g row th and sustainably resolving endemic weaknesses in the 
cotton sector. At the same time, Burkina’s po l i t ica l stability continues to provide a 
steady p la t fo rm fo r sustained re fo rm initiatives, national ownership i s developing 
strongly around an evo lv ing development agenda wh ich incorporates new focus areas, 
inc lud ing demography and environmental preservation, and the current leadership has 
demonstrated clear commitment to better governance and broader participation in 
decision-making. The CAS seeks to harness these opportunities by (i) targeting clear 
e n t r y points t o achieve truly transformative impact in diversification; commercialized 
agriculture and social service delivery; and (ii) adopting new and transformative ways o f 
doing bus iness w h i c h invo lve be t ter positioning Burkina’s development in a regional 
context, strengthening analytical support, adopting horizontal and multi-sectoral 
approaches to address g row th and human development in a more integrated and ho l is t ic 
manner and developing results-focused approaches 
t o 
the emerging 
issues o f 
environmental preservation3’ and demography. 

35 In the case o f env ironmen ta l preservation, the CAS seeks t o target short t e rm m i t i g a t i o n measures tha t 
w i l l enhance ag r icu l tu ra l p roduc t iv i ty , secure the popu la t ion ’s access t o na tura l resources and en su re tha t 
environmental risks associated w i t h the d r i ve s o f g row th - agr icu l ture and m i n i n g - are ac t ive ly pursued. 
W h i l e the strategy does n o t d i rec t ly focus upon the broader issue o f c l ima te change, the short te rm 

26 

58 . 

Adaptability in the context of a global recession. The strategy simultaneously 
aims to assist Bu rk ina Faso in weathering the storm o f the global financial crisis by 
targeting the country’s economic and social vulnerabilities and by pa r t ia l ly front-loading 
available resources. Sustained budget support to accommodate losses in state revenue to 
support the Government’s emergency po l i cy re fo rm and ins t i tu t ion strengthening 
response in the cotton sector and social protection, w i l l be accompanied by special safety 
ne t interventions (including food security and nutrition). The CAS also envisages the 
possible need fo r adjustment o f the program t o a l low fo r c r i t ica l or unforeseen 
eventualities, inc lud ing the possibility o f topping up budget support to provide supportive 
counter-cyclical financing. G iven the slow-down in global markets, the g row th agenda o f 
the strategy places particular emphasis on developing loca l and regional markets. 

5 9 . 

Selectivity and improved inter-sectoral coordination fo r greater impact. The 
CAS focuses Bank engagement primarily on the targeted areas o f agriculture and 
governance in social service delivery. The new program w i l l significantly reduce the 
areas in which the Bank provides financial support. For example, no new IDA financing 
i s envisaged for: (i) p r ima ry education; (ii) health and H IV /A IDS , outside o f fam i ly 
planning; (iii) pub l ic sector management reform; and (vi) energy. In these sectors the 
focus w i l l be on continued po l icy dialogue36 and ensuring the implementation o f the 
sizeable existing vertical po r t fo l io in energy, health and education. This selectivity also 
takes in to account the significant support provided by other donors in the relevant sectors, 
as outlined in Annex 14. In the context o f human development, while new vertical 
financing i s not envisaged fo r the period o f the CAS, support w i l l be channeled to social 
service delivery horizontally along the en t i re supply chain. The strategy also take s a 
more se lec t ive approach t o budget support by targeting a narrower se t o f concentration 
areas for wh i ch clear institutional anchors fo r re fo rm are identified. Financial support 
under the f i r s t strategic theme w i l l also be spatially concentrated around poles o f growth. 
The selectivity adopted by the strategy w i l l be accompanied by more effective inter- 
sectoral coordination. The CAS w i l l reduce p ro l i fe ra t ion o f activities and seek 
appropriate consolidation through multisectoral operations on g row th poles and 
decentralized development and a reduction in the number o f project implementation 
units. This w i l l requ i re continued e f fo r t to wo rk effectively across sectoral silos and 
recognition o f ind iv idua l contributions to tasks. 

60. 
Raising the stakes on aid effectiveness. The strategy i s a j o i n t strategy between 
the IFC, MIGA and the W o r l d Bank wh ich aims to enhance W o r l d Bank Group synergies 
in key areas such as private sector development, investment climate reform, go ld mining, 
cotton and agriculture. The donor community i s committed t o developing a j o i n t 
assistance strategy after 20 1 1. Du r ing the CAS period, the W o r l d Bank w i l l wo rk with 

measures adopted are aligned with the Aftican Region’s Strategy for Making Development Climate 
Resilient and the Bank w i l l continue t o explore regional opportunities to advance dialogue on climate 
change. 
36 A key example i s in basic education where the Bank w i l l continue to be the administrator o f the 
Education For A l l Fast Track Initiative Catalytic Fund grant (EFA FTI) and w i l l remain engaged in policy 
dialogue with Government on basic education objectives. 

27 

the partners to b r ing this commitment t o fruition. 
Imp ro v ing a id effectiveness over the 
period o f the CAS also constitutes one o f the cornerstones o f the strategy. The 
programmatic approach t o budget support w i l l be continued and assistance in imp rov ing 
the country’s pub l ic financial management and procurement systems w i l l pave the way 
fo r the increased use o f country systems. The CAS program also actively seeks synergies 
with other donors. A mapping o f donor’s activities in the relevant sectors i s contained in 
Annex 14. At the same time, the strategy seeks t o balance l o w costs and aid f l ow 
predictability with f lex ib i l i ty particularly given the current context o f multiple shocks. 
This w i l l invo lve exploring opportunities to provide counter-cyclical budget support in 
the event o f unforeseen cr ises .

IDA Availability 

61. 
The CAS covers the period FYlO - 12, the last two years o f IDA15 (FY10-11) 
and the first year o f IDA 16. The overall size o f the IDA envelope during the CAS 
period i s assumed to be about SDR 354.3 m i l l ion , with an average annual allocation o f 
about SDR 11 8 m i l l i o n fo r each o f the years. However, due to the frontloading o f SDR 
48 m i l l i o n in FY 0 9 in response to the global financial crisis, the remaining indicative 
IDA envelope fo r t h e CAS period i s reduced to SDR 306.3 m i l l ion . The estimates fo r FY 
1 1-12 are indicative only. Actual allocations during these years w i l l depend on: (i) total 
IDA resources available; (ii) the country’s performance rating; (iii) the performance and 
assistance t e rm s o f other IDA borrowers; (iv) the t e rm s o f IDA’S assistance (grants or 
credits); and (v) the number o f IDA -e l ig ib le countries. The FY 12 indicative allocation 
assumes that I D A 1 6 resources w i l l be at the same l e v e l as IDA 15. IDA allocations are 
made in SDRs based on performance, and the U S $ equivalent i s dependent upon the 
prevailing exchange rate. W i t h Burkina’s three-year Country Po l icy and Institutional 
Assessmen t (CPIA) average o f 3.7, the country i s currently classified with h i g h risk o f 
debt distress and, therefore, i t w i l l receive a l l i t s allocations in the fo rm o f grants u n l e s s 
i t s debt sustainability pos i t ion changes. The country needs to strengthen policies and 
ins t i tu t ion effectiveness t o improve i t s CP IA rating. A short to medium t e r m action plan 
fo r imp rov ing t h e country’s performance, particularly focused on measures achievable 
over the next two years, was developed during a workshop initiated b y the W o r l d Bank 
and hosted j o i n t l y with the Government in December 2008. The action plan includes: (i) 
elaboration and implementation o f an action plan in the finance sector; (ii) universal 
health insurance for improved social protection; (iii) the full alignment o f sectoral 
policies with the PRSP; (iv) effective t rans fe r s to communes; (v) implementation o f 
recommendations on the study on corruption in the pub l ic sector; and (vi) publication o f 
s umm a r i e s o f laws passed to in fo rm the public.

CAS Instruments 

62. 
In l i n e with Burkina’s good performance, the Bank w i l l continue and better target 
the use o f development po l icy lending. The PRSCs w i l l be designed around th ree key 
objectives: (i) growth (including support to the cotton sector); (ii) decentralization; and 
(iii) public financial management. The PRSC ser ies w i l l closely complement the 
investment lending program b y supporting po l i cy reforms needed to create enabling 

28

Outcome 1: Sustainedperformance of the co t ton sector 

65 . Given (i) the impact o f the global recession and structural weaknesses affecting 
the current v iab i l i ty o f the cotton sector and (ii) the importance o f the sector fo r g row th in 
the short to medium term , significant resources w i l l be invested t o support the 
Government to rescue and re fo rm the sector and protect populations f i o m the negative 
impact o f the cotton crisis. The Ag r icu l tu ra l P roduc t iv i ty and Food Security Project 
(APFSP) planned fo r FY 10 w i l l include a cotton sector structural enhancement 
component. This component, together with t h e PRSC series, w i l l support the adoption 
and implementation o f t h e Government’s th ree year action plan to address structural 
weaknesses and imp rove t h e sector’s competitiveness. These operations w i l l also support 
measures to protect loca l communities implicated in the cotton sector, inc lud ing 
sustainable measures t o address fa rme r indebtedness and imp rove access to affordable 
inputs. The ongoing G loba l Fa c i l i t y for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) - 
funded - integrated weather risk management study w i l l investigate the feasibility o f 
weather-based insurance t o protect producers against ra in fa l l variations. The recently 
launched West A f r i c a Regional Biosecurity (WARBP ) project w i l l support measures to 
ensure that appropriate biosafety standards are applied to the Government’s ro l l -ou t o f 
productivity-enhancing genetically mod i f ied Bt cotton. I F C w i l l coordinate closely with 
the Bank to identify appropriate support to private activities in the sector and MIGA w i l l 
also examine the poss ib i l i ty o f extending guarantees to the cotton g inn ing companies.

Increased agricultural p roduc t ion w i l l help imp rove food security, generate ru ra l 
revenue and facilitate the shift f r om subsistence fa rm ing to p roduc t ion fo r market. The 
APFSP w i l l focus o n imp rov ing access 
to productivity-enhancing technologies, 
enhancing post-harvest storage facilities and targeting food access constraints. 

67. 
Central to imp rov ing agricultural p roduc t iv i ty and preserving Burkina’s natural 
resource base i s the need t o improve natural resource management and resilience to 
extreme c l ima t ic va r iab i l i ty . Bu rk ina Faso has been selected as a p r i o r i t y country fo r 
disaster risk management support through the GFDRR. A country disaster risk 
management and climate change country program i s under preparation and w i l l f o rm the 
basis fo r scaled-up support. The CBRD I1 project w i l l continue t o support loca l 
communities to sustainably manage their land through the dissemination o f conservation 
and productivity-enhancing techniques. 

68 . 

Several regional agricultural projects w i l l also contribute to the outcome, 
including: (i) a regional in i t ia t ive that promotes collaborative efforts to improve 
agricultural technology generation and dissemination at the national and regional leve ls ; 
(ii) the ongoing W A R B P project; and (iii) sub-regional w o r k o n water resource 
management in river basins (Vo l ta and Niger).

Outcome 3 : Accelerated diversification and increased exports 

69. 
In l i n e with the Government’s proposed Strategy f o r Accelerated G r o w t h and 
Sustainable Development, the C A S adopts a spa t ia l ly concentrated 
‘ g r ow t h po le ’ 
approach t o d ive rs i f ica t ion , and comme r c ia l iza t ion o f ag r icu l tu re and l ives tock . A series

va lue chains, in ag r icu l tu re and l ives tock , mining and t o u r i sm and tha t these va lue chains 
tend t o be spa t ia l ly concentrated, resu l t ing in the emergence o f several reg iona l po les o f 
g r ow t h po ten t ia l (see Append ix E). Examp les o f these areas o f po ten t ia l are dep ic ted in 
Figure 5 . T h e g r ow t h p o l e approach w i l l be deve loped and launched during the p e r i o d o f 
the CAS , f o l l ow i n g the d i rec t ion o f Gove rnmen t and p r iva te sector comm i tmen t . A s a 
medium t e rm endeavor and in order t o encourage p r iva te sector inves tmen t and achieve 
d ive rs i f ica t ion and expo r t growth, the g r ow t h po les approach w i l l requ i re sustained 
support beyond the p e r i o d o f the CAS . 

70. 
During the C A S period, the W o r l d Bank w i l l w o r k with the Gove rnmen t and 
p r iva te sector t o further appraise the po ten t ia l and analyze the social, economic and 
env i ronmen ta l impac t o f deve lop ing supportive in f ras t ruc tu re and services in a selection

In order to ensure that the requ i s i te s k i l l s bases are available in the selected 
g row th poles, the ongoing Post-Primary Education Project (PPEP) w i l l analyze specific 
labor market needs and support programs aimed at developing specialized s k i l l s in key 
areas. Programs w i l l target imp rov ing the employment prospects fo r you th in particular. 
The IFC w i l l investigate the possibility o f supporting private providers o f targeted s k i l l s 
development. The International Ins t i tu te fo r Water and Environmental Engineering 
Project (2IE) w i l l continue t o support the training o f h igh ly skilled professionals in the 
areas o f water, energy, environment and infrastructure engineering. WB I w i l l also 
investigate the possibility o f developing a regional tertiary education cen ter o f excellence 
in Bu rk ina Faso. 

73. 
Supporting g row th in the m i n i n g sector w i l l continue with a focus o n 
strengthening managerial, administrative and technical s k i l l s and knowledge in the 
m in ing sector as we l l as in major accountability institutions (such as the anti-fraud 
commission), enhancing social accountability and transparency and ensuring adequate 
support fo r the management o f macroeconomic r i s k s attendant o n the development o f the 
sector. The Wo r ld Bank w i l l assist the Government in the implementation o f the EITI++ 
through the West A f r i c a Regional M i n i n g Sector In i t ia t ive wh ich aims to imp rove the 
capacity o f regional governments to manage mineral sectors in a transparent and efficient 
manner and facilitate regional harmonization and coordination in the development o f the 
m i n i n g sector. This support w i l l invo lve a scoping study to identify constraints and r i s k s 
in Bu rk ina Faso, inc lud ing those related to the environment, loca l communities, 
transparency and supportive linkages in the sector. The ongoing CEDP w i l l provide 
support to the Ministry o f M i n e s to enhance institutional and mon i to r ing capacities. In 

33 

support o f private sector investment, the IFC’s m in ing d i v is ion and linkages unit plans t o 
launch a sector-wide m i n i n g sector linkages and access to finance program wh ich w i l l be 
complemented b y a Trade Development Trust Fund study to assess the availability and 
potential o f private sector-provided supportive goods and services. MIGA’s guarantee o f 
Essakane ’s major go ld m in ing investment constitutes a significant and ongoing 
contribution t o growth in the sector and, i f private sector in te res t exists, further 
guarantees could be explored during the CAS period. 

74. 

To improve the competitiveness o f BurkinabC exports, a regional r a i l project i s 
under consideration and a study in to the feasibility o f a new international airport i s 
underway. The W o r l d Bank w i l l also support the Government in managing the 
environment and natural resource r i s k s associated with the agricultural and m in ing 
drivers o f growth through a Country Environmental Assessmen t po l i cy note to strengthen 
the implementation capacity o f the M in is t ry o f Environment f o r environmental 
assessment and management. 

Outcome 4: Enhanced enab l ing environment for u r iva te sector-led d ive rs i f ica t ion 

75 . 

The Bank w i l l assist the Government in further developing an institutional and 
regulatory framework that i s conducive to encouraging private sector-led diversification 
in the growth poles, increasing export earnings and fac i l i ta t ing trade and commerce 
through the PRSC ser ies and the ongoing CEDP. The I FC w i l l continue to support 
investment climate reforms through i t s h igh ly su ccess fu l D o i n g Bus iness Be t te r program. 
In the finance sector, the W o r l d Bank and the I FC w i l l support the creation o f new 
financial se rv ices to improve credit access fo r small and medium sized en te rp r ises , 
particularly in the agricultural sector. The Bank w i l l implement t h e recommendations o f 
the 2008 ROSC on Accounting and Aud i t ing and assist the Government in promoting 
financial transparency, accountability and market discipline o f the private sector and o f 
s ta te owned en terpr ises . The ongoing W A E M U Capital Market Development Project 
w i l l support access to finance and the development o f regional capital markets. Regional 
support w i l l also be g iven t o harmonization o f business laws with OH AD A . The 
implementation o f land re fo rm w i l l also be c r i t ica l for attracting investments in 
agriculture. The M C A has committed significant resources to assisting the Government 
w i t h the implementation o f the Ru ra l Land Re fo rm Law, which was passed b y Parliament 
on 16 June 2009. As a complement to the MC A ’ s support, the W o r l d Bank w i l l provide 
targeted land re fo rm implementation support through the growth pole project ser ies . 

Outcome 5: Imu roved access to reg iona l and in te rna t iona l markets 

76. 
The CAS program i s framed within the broader context o f regional initiatives 
aimed at disenclaving the country and imp rov ing access to regional and international 
markets. The Bank w i l l support regional initiatives to strengthen trade regimes and 
develop regional value chains to complement the program’s in-country g row th pole and 
value chain support. 
In transport, the ongoing West A f r ica Transport and Transit 
Facilitation Project w i l l reduce transport delays, uncertainty and costs along the Tema- 
Ouaga-Bamako corridor t o boost in t ra and inter-regional trade as w e l l as support Bu rk ina 

34 

and Ma l i ’s access to the sea. The Transport Infrastructure Project w i l l enable extended 
support fo r road network extension and/or rehabilitation. The regional r a i l project w i l l 
improve r a i l (especially freight) connections. The West A f r ican Air Transport Safety and 
Security Project w i l l continue to support the development o f strategic airport investments 
fo r greater connectivity. In energy, the WAPP interconnections with Ghana and C8te 
d’Ivoire w i l l reduce generation costs and increase access t o electricity. In ICT , the W o r l d 
Bank intends to support the ECOWAS telecoms program t o improve access to quality 
I C T se rv ices at a competitive price by promoting dialogue o n the es tab l ishmen t o f an 
integrated regional market and enhanced competition o n international gateways, 
inc lud ing SAT3 optical fiber cable. 

Strategic theme two: Sha r ing growth through improved service delivery. 

77 . Under the second strategic theme, the CAS w i l l focus o n the fo l low ing outcomes: 
(i) improved demand fo r quality social services; (ii) enhanced efficiency o f pub l ic 
resource management fo r better service delivery; and (iii) strengthened institutions fo r 
improved delivery o f quality social services. 

Ou tcome I : Im g r o v e d demand for qua l i ty soc ia l services 

78. 

Greater involvement o f communities, citizens, parliament and c i v i l society w i l l 
promote enhanced accountability with respect t o the delivery o f services and the 
alignment o f services with loca l needs and priorities. The strategy harnesses the 
supportive po l i t i ca l environment fo r public participation in decision-making by placing 
particular emphasis o n in fo rma t ion dissemination and disclosure and pub l ic participation 
and monitoring. The PRSC se r ies w i l l continue t o support disclosure and dissemination 
o f accessible budget information, inc lud ing intergovernmental trans fers . Through po l i cy 
notes, the Bank w i l l facilitate broad pub l ic debate on key p o l i c y reforms. The C BRD I I 
and Decentralized Urban Capacity Bu i ld ing (DUCB) projects and the Pub l ic Expenditure 
Review (PER) program and decentralization po l i cy note w i l l support mechanisms fo r 
community involvement in loca l decision-making and monitoring. The fo l low -on 
Decentralized Development project w i l l institutionalize loca l accountability in the 
decentralization process by: (i) strengthening the capacity o f communes to use 
participatory approaches in the design and mon i to r ing o f loca l development plans and 
service delivery; (ii) developing clear guidelines fo r the regular dissemination o f pub l ic 
resource expenditure in fo rma t ion at both central and loca l levels; (iii) instituting an 
effective and standardized complaints mechanism; and (iv) establishing regular and 
systematic data collection at the loca l level to mon i to r the performance o f t h e communes. 
The inclusion o f c iv i l society and local communities in mon i to r ing Bank operations w i l l 
be scaled up during the CAS period, through Japanese Social Development Fund (JSDF) 
and Governance Partnership Fa c i l i ty (GPF) funding. The W o r l d Bank w i l l also embark 
upon a more inclusive and participatory outreach program fo r c i v i l society and the media. 

79 . WB I w i l l support initiatives to strengthen the oversight capabilities o f the media 
and the parliament and w i l l investigate the poss ib i l i ty o f fac i l i ta t ing learning, knowledge 
sharing, and advisory assistance through peer-to-peer media networks. W B I w i l l also 

3 5 

explore further opportunities to enhance the Na t iona l Assembly’s ab i l i ty to effectively 
perform i t s functions, particularly with regard to oversight o f the budget and 
implementation and performance o f sectoral policies and programs, inc lud ing mining. 

Outcome 2: Enhanced efficiencv of public resource management for better service 
deliverv 

80. 
A focus o f t h i s outcome w i l l be to s treng then pub l ic financial management and 
procurement systems. Du r ing the CAS period, the Bank w i l l support capacity 
development initiatives and additional reforms to facilitate the eventual shift towards 
increased use o f country systems, through the PRSC series, a PEFA Assessmen t in FY 1 1 
and other interventions (see B o x 3). A multi-donor supported programmatic PER started 
in FY09 w i l l analyze the impact o f the decentralization o f basic service delivery on the 
transparency, efficiency and effectiveness o f pub l ic expenditure, particularly at the loca l 
leve l . Add i t iona l P F M support fo r decentralized loca l government w i l l be provided 
through the ongoing Administrative Capacity B u i l d i n g Project (ACBP), C BRD I I and 
D U C B projects and through a PEFA Assessmen t o n Ouagadougou. As a corollary to 
this, and drawing upon the present enabling environment on an t i -comp t ion , the W o r l d 
Bank w i l l provide support to strengthening and rationalizing P F M control and oversight 
mechanisms. This w i l l include continued support to the new ASCE41 and to the quality 
o f reporting b y the Court o f Accounts. 

4 1 The ASCE has already responded positively to ongoing IDF-funded support. Given the innovative form 
o f the ASCE, which combines anti-corruption responsibilities w i th overall responsibility for the internal 
audit and oversight bodies in Burkina Faso, there i s r e a l potential to develop the institution as a best 
practice example in the SSA Francophone region, wh ich i s otherwise characterized by extensive 
institutional fiagmentation and jurisdictional conflicts between IGE/IGF/technical inspectorates and Courts 
o f Account. 

36 

Outcome 3 : Strengthened ins t i tu t ions for improved delivery of qua l i ty soc ia l services 

81. 
IDA w i l l support bo th central and loca l l e v e l s in achieving functional and 
effective decentralized service delivery. At the central level, the Bank w i l l support the 
Government in developing operational aspects o f i t s decentralization agenda, inc lud ing 
an e f fec t ive inter-governmental t rans fe r structure, through the PER programmatic series, 
technical assistance and budget support. I t w i l l also strengthen central administrative 
capacity to effectively implement the decentralization process through the ACBP. The 
education sector i s the furthest advanced sector in implementing the decentralization o f 
social services, having already commenced fiscal t rans fe rs t o urban communes. Through 
the PRSC ser ies and the Education Fast-Track Initiative, the Bank w i l l support the 
Education Ministry in ongoing efforts to rationalize and coordinate the devolution o f 
education se rv ice delivery to the communes. The ongoing IDA financed Statcap 
Program aims to enhance the collection and analysis o f reliable core national statistical 
data. 

82. 
At a loca l level, IDA w i l l focus on mak ing decentralization wo rk by: (i) 
supporting the development o f loca l commune capacities t o deliver qua l i ty social 
services; (ii) p rov id ing communes with resources to finance loca l development priorities 
and; (iii) strengthening capacity in the context o f loca l community-managed services, 
inc lud ing School-Based Management models. D raw ing upon a capacity assessment o f 
communes conducted by the PER, the existing projects on urban and ru ra l decentralized 
support, D U C B and CBRD I I , w i l l be adjusted t o facilitate a comprehensive capacity 
development program fo r a l l ru ra l and urban communes, inc lud ing those urban 
communes which are currently no t covered b y either project. 
The fo l low -on 
Decentralized Development project in FY 10 w i l l consolidate the D U C B and C BRD I I 
capacity development activities and directly 
finance p r i o r i t y loca l development 
investments at the commune level. 

83. 
Under the existing po r t fo l io (Education fo r A l l Fast-Track Initiative, Health 
Services Support Program and CBRD I I ) , IDA w i l l continue to target vulnerable 
populations through support to the delivery o f c r i t ica l basic services, inc lud ing literacy, 
nu t r i t ion (including quality and quantity) and social safety ne ts . Technical assistance fo r 
a review o f social safety ne ts4 * commenced in FY 0 9 w i l l (i) review existing social safety 
net programs and make po l icy recommendations to improve their effectiveness; and (ii) 
assist the Government t o develop a framework fo r po l icy discussion and consensus- 
bu i ld ing among various stakeholders o n the ro le o f safety ne ts . As a f o l l ow o n to the 
rev iew and where needed, budget support funds w i l l be rese rved to increase the scope o f 
safety nets. A Health S ta tus Report w i l l also be conducted in FY12 . T o support the 
urban expansion o f the capital city and to extend the significant achievements o f IDA’S 
earlier support to t h e Ouagadougou Water Supply project, the F Y 0 9 Urban Water and 
Sanitation project w i l l be implemented during the CAS period. 

84. 
IFC’s engagement through the Hea l th in A f r i c a and A f i i c a Schools initiatives w i l l

DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS AND AID EFFECTIVENESS 

8 8 . 

The Government has recently asserted i t s leadership ro le in coordinating 
development assistance in Bu rk ina Faso bo th under the existing PRSP and around a 
revised development strategy expected in 201 1. For the mon i to r ing o f the existing PRSP, 
the Government and donors have recently formed a ‘troika’ leadership body consisting o f 
th ree donors t o represen t the development partners. The W o r l d Bank has been selected 
as one o f the th ree t ro ika members fo r FY10. The donor community, inc lud ing the 
W o r l d Bank, has also committed to developing a j o i n t assistance strategy aligned with the 
new government strategy. General budget support w i l l continue to be embedded in the 
General Budget Support Framework (Cadre General d ’Organisation des Appuis 
Budgetaires or CGAB), an organizational framework fo r coordinating and harmonizing 
budget support between the Government and re levan t donors. The PRSC ser ies w i l l be 
fully aligned with the j o i n t CG A B calendar and the j o i n t performance ma t r ix o f the 
CG A B donors. However, to provide real time support in the event o f emerging crises, 
avenues fo r counter-cyclical budget support w i l l be explored. 

8 9 . 

One o f the top priorities o f the CAS i s to assist t h e Government in strengthening 
country systems in order to facilitate their use in donor-financed projects. The Bank w i l l 
also lead sectoral donor dialogue through i t s chair positions in the budget support, 
education, pub l ic financial management and decentralization sector groups. Durin the 
CAS period, particular focus w i l l be placed upon promoting j o i n t analytical work4! 
accordance with the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, the strategy also seeks to 
promote greater involvement o f c i v i l society and the private sector.

The C A S ma in ta ins a strong focus o n manag ing f o r development results.

a close mon i to r ing o f the po r t fo l io44 and continuous monitoring o f CAS outcomes. 

91 . 
In order to address M&E shortcomings identified by the CPPR (2008 ) and t h e 
M&E rev iew conducted in 2009 , the country team w i l l make M&E the focus o f po r t fo l io 
management under the CAS. An M&E action plan has recently been introduced and 
targets: (i) the re t ro f i t t ing o f M&E systems to a l ign w i t h CAS objectives, through mid- 
t e r m reviews and regular supervision; (ii) the inclusion o f robust M&E systems in 
pipeline projects; and (iii) quarterly po r t fo l io reviews in collaboration with the Ministry 
o f Finance. The Bank Group w i l l also strengthen monitoring and evaluation o f projects 
through greater inclusion o f c i v i l society and loca l communities. The CAS mon i to r ing 
system i s closely aligned with the ongoing development o f the national statistical 
capacity. As a t ro ika representative o f development partners fo r FY 10 and generally, the 
Bank w i l l continue to wo rk closely with other ma in development partners t o support the 
Government’s efforts to make more effective and operational the national M&E system 
fo r PRS implementation. 

V I . MANAGING R I S K S 

92 . A prolonged global recession constitutes the most significant risk to the 
economy, particularly in the cotton sector. Vo la t i l i t y in commodities prices, lower 
capital f lows f rom FDI and O D A and weaker demand for BurkinabC exports w i l l affect 
revenue generation, g row th and pub l ic finances, as well as private sector activity. The 
strategy attempts to mitigate these r i s k s b y adopting realistic projections and targeting 
economic and social vulnerability. The focus on restoring balances in the cotton sector, 
imp rov ing transparency, accountability and financial management and supporting a more 
effective social safety ne t structure w i l l cushion the e f fec t o f the economic downturn o n 
the population and protect c r i t ica l expenditure in the context o f limited resources. As in 
previous strategies, the CAS retains significant f lex ib i l i ty to cushion a deeper than 
expected or more prolonged impact through program adjustments and possible top ups 
fo r countercyclical budget support financing. 

9 3 , 
Bu rk ina Faso’s vulnerability to climatic shocks. As demonstrated during the 
2007 droughts and floods, climatic shocks impact upon food security, poverty and export 
earnings in Bu rk ina Faso. W h i l e there i s l i t t l e that the Bank can do to prevent these 
shocks, the strategy envisages support to bo th ex-ante risk reduction (including weather- 
based insurance, land and water resource management and early warning systems) and 
post-facto m i t iga t ion through the p rov is ion o f social safety nets, as well as technical 
assistance support t o environmental management institutional development. 
The 
program aligns clearly behind the new broader A f r ican Reg ion Strategy f o r M a k i n g 
Development Climate Res i l ien t . 

44 

The Results P la t fo rm p i l o t uses ou tpu t lou tcome ind ica tors w h i c h are selected t o re f lec t the Bank’s 
contribution, and are based, as far as possible, on agreed and standardized ind ica tors w i t h other 
development partners (AfDB, DFID, ADB, OECD). They also inc lude harmon ized ind ica tors fo r health, 
education, transport and water, established by the respective Sector Boards.

94. Wh i le the risks of 
internal political tu rmo i l remain low despite prospective 
Presidential elections, sub-regional political insecurity continues to threaten trade 
competitiveness. To mitigate the risk associated w i t h elections, the CAS i s f i rm l y 
grounded in the longer t e r m national v is ion and i s unlikely to be substantially affected b y 
changes o f government o r po l icy . The CAS i s realistic about the possibility that national 
elections may delay re fo rm agendas in the short t e r m and i t seeks to lay the foundations 
fo r likely invigorated re fo rm implementation fo l low ing the conferral o f a new electoral 
mandate. 
In m i t iga t ion o f possible regional po l i t ica l instability, the CAS supports 
regional integration and the opening up o f corridors t o Ghana, M a l i and Benin. 

95 . 
Public sector capacity constraints can constitute a challenge to successful CAS 
implementation. Weak lower leve l and decentralized administrative capacity represen ts 
one o f the most significant obstacles to reform and CAS program implementation. The 
strategy seeks to mitigate t h i s risk by mainstreaming a consistent approach to capacity 
development that targets deep systemic weaknesses, throughout the country program, 
through the use o f the innovative Go v ID f i l te r . Significant resources w i l l be allocated to 
developing decentralized government and administrative capacity in particular. 

96 . 

Spatially concentrating multi-sectoral investments in selected growth poles 
carry important risks. T h e selection o f growth pole locations cou ld be subjected to e l i t e 
capture. Further, the success o f the approach in crowding in private sector investment 
could be jeopardized by a lack o f or limited private sector up-take, particularly given the 
current global financial crisis. Desp i te these fa i r ly significant r isks , the Government’s 
commitment to the g row th pole approach represents an opportunity for transformation 
and greater development impact. The strategy places particular emphasis on the 
collaborative and participatory selection and design o f the g row th poles to mitigate the 
potential fo r e l i t e capture or lack o f private sector up-take. D raw ing upon the already 
strong analytical base, further analysis and technical assistance w i l l be provided to 
support the Government in the objective and well-researched selection o f growth pole 
areas. The team w i l l also wo rk closely with the Government, the private sector and loca l 
communities to ensure that the re i s adequate commitment and private sector in te res t . As 
the g row th pole approach i s a medium t e r m endeavor, the strategy remains realistic as to 
the limited prospects fo r short-term resu l ts . 

97. Multi-sectoral program management 
in growth poles and decentralized 
development w i l l require changes to the way in which the Government, World Bank 
and key stakeholders currently operate. Particular r i s k s are associated w i th : (i) the 
d i f f icu l t ies in integrating the vertical focus o f sectors with the horizontal approach 
adopted b y the CAS; (ii) limited government capacity t o implement multi-sectoral 
interventions; and (iii) t h e d i f f icu l t ies in ensuring coordination between the sectors at the 
stakeholder and country team level. The Government has demonstrated a clear 
commitment for engagement in multi-sectoral activities under the new development 
strategy, to which donors have agreed to align. The strategy seeks to strengthen program 
implementation capacity in executing agencies and institutions. 
Strong country 
management leadership and demonstrated commitment on the part o f the country team 

42 

w i l l also fac i l i ta te p r o g r am management at a coun t r y t e a m level, together with p lans t o 
further decentralize Bank staff.

A. In t rodu c t ion 

This CAS Completion Report (CASCR) assesses the effectiveness o f the W o r l d Bank’s 
Country Assistance Strategy fo r Bu rk ina Faso (CAS) covering the FY06-09 pe r iod and 
highlights the lessons learned. The CAS was designed to support the implementation o f 
the Second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) approved in 2004. A Country 
Assistance Strategy Progress Report (CASPR) was prepared o n June 13, 2007. This 
report covers the period FY06 - f i r s t ha l f o f FY 0 9 and i t s findings w i l l in fo rm the new 
CAS in preparation for FY 10. 

B. B u r k i n a Faso’s Deve lopmen t Ob ject ives 

1. 
Bu rk ina ’s Faso’s long t e rm strategic objectives a r e l in k ed to the M i l l e n n i u m 
Deve lopmen t G o a l (MDG) targets f o r sustained p ro -poo r g row th ; pove r ty reduc t ion 
a n d ra ised l i fe expectancy. The four pillars o f the strategy are: (i) raising g row th and 
equity in a stable macro-economic environment t o reduce poverty; (ii) increasing access 
t o and quality o f basic social services; (iii) imp rov ing employment and income 
opportunities fo r the poor; and (iv) imp rov ing governance w i t h a particular emphasis on 
public sector management and budget management reforms. 

2. 
Desp ite slower economic g row th in the last couple o f years a n d a recent 
increase in the incidence o f poverty , B u r k i n a Faso has p e r fo rm ed w e l l ove r the 
PRSP implementation has been characterized by a relatively stable 
pe r iod . 
macroeconomic environment (notwithstanding the d i f f icu l t external environment), 
structural reforms in the cotton, energy and telecommunications sectors, improvements to 
the investment climate and investments l i n k e d to the realization o f the MDGs. Bu rk ina 
Faso’s CP IA rating remains relatively h i g h at 3.7. The Government responded well to 
the se r ies o f crises, implementing emergency measures in the cotton sector and elevating 
the longer t e r m strategic importance o f boosting agricultural production and food 
security.45 

45 The Government aims t o achieve a ‘green revo lu t ion ’ through the development o f market-integrated 
agriculture and compe t i t ive agro- indus tr ia l produc ts through diversification, in tens i f ica t ion and increased 
output in h igh-va lue added goods. (2007).

3. 

The 2006 CAS outcomes were appropriately aligned to supporting the 
country’s longer term strategic goals and program lending allocations reflected 
national priorities. The CAS aligned Wo r ld Bank support to a l l four o f the PRS pillars, 
using a blend o f analytic w o r k and investment and policy-based lending ins t rumen ts . 
Importantly, the Wo r ld Bank demonstrated f lex ib i l i ty in adjusting i t s operations to 
changing country priorities over the period. Heavy f lood ing in 2007, combined with 
r is ing f u e l and food prices, a crisis in the country’s ma in export sector, the cotton sector, 
and the global financial crisis created unforeseen short t e r m country needs and re - 
positioned certain long t e r m national strategic goals. The W o r l d Bank supported safety 
ne t measures through: (i) the re-allocation o f existing project funds fo r seed distribution; 
(ii) additional financing in FY08 fo r community nu t r i t ion and school feeding programs; 
and (iii) additional financing in the health sector to enable a rap id response to the 
meningitis outbreak in 2008. The W o r l d Bank also tailored upcoming budget support 
and re-oriented the focus o f certain investment projects, such as the Competitiveness and 
Enterprise Development Project (CEDP), to re-align Bank support with Bu rk ina Faso’s 
evolving strategic goals. Increased emphasis was placed on stabilizing the performance 
o f the cotton sector, improving, supporting the g row ing m i n i n g sector, and enhancing 
governance and anti-corruption measures. These revised priorities were accommodated 
by adjustments in the design o f the proposed portfolio, accordingly no revision o f the 
strategy was required. 

4. 
The country’s long term strategic objectives have hitherto failed to address 
the major development constraint of rapid and uncontrolled population growth in 
Burkina. Recent studies, inc lud ing the Government-sponsored Etude du Schema 
Na t iona l D’ Amenagement du Territoire (SNAT) and the upcoming Country Economic 
Memorandum (CEM) reveal the major challenges Burkina’s population g row th poses fo r 
i t s development. N e i t h e r the PRSP nor Bu rk ina Faso’s longer t e r m strategies (e.g. 
Bu rk ina Faso V is ion 2025) identify demography as a constraint fo r wh ich immediate 
interventions are required. This issue should be addressed in the next CAS. 

B. Country Assistance Strategy Progress and Outcomes 

5 . 

Overall progress achieved in implementing the CAS i s satisfactory. 16 key 
indicators /outcomes were identified in the CAS Results M a t r i x to mon i to r the 
effectiveness o f the Bank’s implementation o f the 2006 CAS. Performance against the 
CAS outcome indicators i s positive as reflected in Table 1. The stronger focus on resu l ts 
adopted by the CAS was successful in enhancing the mon i to rab i l i ty and evaluability o f 
the CAS i t s e l f . However a discrete measurement o f the W o r l d Bank’s contribution 
towards the PRS outcomes to wh i ch the CAS i s aligned i s d i f f icu l t to assess because: 

a. Certain indicators in the CAS Results M a t r i x are influenced by the 
activities o f other donors, particularly in the case o f better harmonized 
sectors, such as health, education and budget support. 
b. Certain projects did no t have adequate mechanisms in place to measure 
some o f the CAS indicators (due to poo r ly aligned project indicators or 

59 

weaknesses in data collection). During the n e x t C A S period, the design o f 
p ro jec ts shou ld better inco rpo ra te C A S outcomes and indicators. 
c. T h e con t r ibu t ions o f some Bank operations were n o t captured by 
ind ica to rs in the C A S Results M a t r i x . T h e mid-term r e v i ew o f the C A S 
c o u l d be better u t i l i z e d t o f ine - tune the resu l ts - f ramewo rk . 

6. 
CAS implementation was supported by a generally appropriate selection o f 
analytical and lending instruments. IDA support unde r the C A S sh i f ted the focus f r o m 
t rad i t iona l projects, de l ive r ing support instead th rough pa r t ic ipa to r y ana ly t ic wo rk , 
expanded development p o l i c y lending, basket fund subhec to r -w ide approaches and 
commun i ty -d r iven development mechanisms. Budge t support amounted t o 52 percent o f 
IDA spending and 28 percent o f the ac t ive p o r t f o l i o in December 2008 consisted o f 
p rog ramma t ic investments in basic services. The channe l ing o f resources th rough the 
budget ins tead o f p ro jec ts strengthened the dec is ion -mak ing capab i l i t ies o f the 
Gove rnmen t and enhanced Gove rnmen t ownership, and f inanc ia l management and 
accoun tab i l i ty and o f fe red su f f ic ien t f l e x i b i l i t y t o accommodate changes. Spec i f ic 
p rog ram and p ro jec t lending a l lowed targeted investments in p r i o r i t y areas. The selection 
o f instruments also enabled the Bank t o d i rec t ly support d i f fe ren t leve ls o f government, 
i n c l u d i n g central, sector-wide, district, commune and v i l l a g e levels. 

7 . 

The sequencing o f analytical and lending services enabled the Bank to 
provide strategic and well-targeted assistance. T h e series o f studies comp le ted in 
FY06 , i n c l u d i n g the L a b o r M a r k e t Study, Inves tmen t C l ima te Assessment ( ICA ) and 
F inanc ia l Sector R e v i ew (FSR), assisted in i d e n t i f y i n g p r i o r i t y r e f o rm f o r suppo r t ing 
g r ow t h and he lped t o design the Bank’s lend ing p rog ram . The Educa t ion Sector R e v i ew 
and P u b l i c Expend i tu re Rev iews (PER) 
f o r F Y 0 9 o n decentralized basic services 
enhanced the Bank ’s understanding o f k e y basic services sectors. The D o i n g Business 
Reports have also p r o v i d e d valuable guidance in ta rge t ing W o r l d B a n k support in 
im p r o v i n g the inves tmen t climate. An in te rna l p o l i t i c a l economy analysis (FY08 ) and 
the upcom ing Coun t ry E conom ic Memo randum (CEM ) have gu ided the Bank’s decisions 
o n the d i rec t ion o f the fu tu re CAS . 

8. 
Notwithstanding this, Bank support could have benefited from greater 
selectivity and inter-sectoral coordination. In a t temp t ing t o cover a l l o f the outcomes 
unde r each o f the fou r pillars t o w h i c h the C A S a l igned support, the coun t ry p r o g r am 
spread Bank support w i d e l y across sectors and geographic regions. The extended scope 
and size o f the p rog ram p r o v e d cumbersome t o imp lemen t and resu l ted in m o r e dispersed 
and weaker impac t and visibility than anticipated. Apart f r o m greater selectivity, the 
p rog ram w o u l d have bene f i ted f r o m greater coo rd ina t ion between i n d i v i d u a l p ro jec ts and 
sectors. The interrelated nature o f many o f the C A S outcomes ca l led f o r a mo re cohesive 
approach th rough w h i c h the synergies and complementarities o f the va r ious in te rven t ions 
c o u l d have been mo re fully exp lo i ted t o max im ize the e f f ic ien t use o f Bank resources. 
The sequencing and balance between general budget support and investment 
lending could also have been fine-tuned. W h i l e general budget support p roved suitable 
f o r mac ro reforms, i t h a d less impac t in in f luenc ing sectoral re fo rms and ins t i tu t iona l 
strengthening. 
In terms o f sequencing, capac i ty -bu i ld ing techn ica l assistance p ro jec ts 

60 

that were intended to run parallel t o budget support initiatives were o f ten hamstrung b y 
unpredictability and delays in specific budgetary allocations. This was demonstrated in 
the Decentralized Urban Capacity B u i l d i n g Project (DUCB) wh ich was impeded by 
delayed budget investment t rans fe rs to loca l governments. 

9 . 
CAS implementation had a moderate impact on the client’s institutional 
development. Support to a multi-faceted re fo rm agenda, improved pub l ic financial 
management and the decentralization process was coupled w i t h targeted institutional 
strengthening and capacity-building initiatives across a broad spec t rum o f stakeholders, 
inc lud ing central government agencies, departments, decentralized agencies, community 
structures and the private sector. However, institutional and human capacity remains 
exceptionally weak and requ ires intensified support. Future plans to improve and u t i l ize 
country financial management and procurement systems wou ld enhance the impact o f 
Bank interventions on Bu rk ina Faso’s institutional development. 

10. 
Sustainability: With a central Government that i s committed and leading v is ib le 
and meaningful reforms, the effects o f many o f t h e Bank’s interventions during the CAS 
pe r iod are likely to be sustained over time. The country’s strong ownership o f the 
program considerably reduces the r i s k s o f reversal or change in direction. In addition, 
donor commitments remain strong w h i c h augurs well fo r sustained in f lows o f external 
assistance. Fo r example, investment climate reforms under the D o i n g Bus iness program 
are helping to lay some o f the foundations for g row th and private sector involvement. 
The urban water project focused on strengthening the institutional capacity and 
management o f the nation’s water utility and the Community-Based Ru ra l Development 
Project (CBRD I I ) supported the establishment o f communal structures fo r ongoing loca l 
participation. O f concern, however, i s the drop in the IEG’s outcomes and sustainability 
ratings o f the po r t fo l io over the last th ree years. An action plan t o in tens i f y po r t fo l io 
management i s currently being implemented to address this issue . 

Supporting accelerated and shared growth (pillar 1) 

G row th and poverty reduction: 

11. 
Despite severe exogenous shocks in the last few years, the country was able to 
maintain macroeconomic stability. Due to a se r ies o f external shocks wh ich caused a 
f a l l in cotton and agricultural production and exports and h i g h food and energy pr ices , 
economic g row th slowed f r om 5.5 percent in 2006 to 3.6 percent in 2007 and in f la t ion 
rose f rom 2.4 percent in 2006 t o 7.7 percent in April 2008 and 9.5 percent fo r 2008. 
However, economic recovery due t o a good harvest in 2008 saw GDP g row th r i s e t o 5 
percent. Although Bu rk ina Faso’s development endeavors were adversely affected by the 
se r ies o f shocks over the period, the Government managed to maintain a relatively stable 
macroeconomic environment - a resu l t o f i t s solid fiscal discipline, sound po l icy 
implementation and in f lows o f external aid. The un fo ld ing negative impact o f the global 
financial crisis o n Bu rk ina Faso poses a significant threat to the country’s continued 
macro-economic stability. 

61 

12. 
The poverty headcount i s estimated to have decreased from 46.3 percent in 
2003 to 42.1 percent in 2006, however a notable increase in the incidence o f poverty 
between 2007 and 2008 has reversed the progress made over the previous four 
years. Decelerated economic growth, energy and food price increases and a drop in 
agricultural productivity in 2007 and 2008 raised the share o f the population l i v i n g be low 
the poverty l i n e to 45 percent. 

’ 

13. 
The Bank’s strategy t o support Bu rk ina in accelerating shared g row th targeted i) 
increasing regional integration; ii) expanding and d ive rs i fy ing export earnings; iii) 
imp rov ing the 
investment climate and; 
iv ) developing more efficient economic 
infrastructure. The CAS achieved sound progress in supporting this pillar’s objective, 
with achievements in meeting most o f the outcomes fo r the pillar. As a r e s u l t o f the 
cotton crisis in 2007, t h e Bank placed particular emphasis on supporting the cotton 
sector. Consequently, support to diversification o f the economy outside o f the cotton 
sector has been slow to commence. 

Expanding and diversifyin? export e a r n i n g : 

14. 
The Government’s in i t ia t ion o f higher yield Bt cotton seeds use, better storage 
facilities, advanced agricultural techniques, recapitalization plans fo r cotton companies 
and better-aligned producer p r ice setting mechanisms enabled the country to withstand 
the cotton crisis in 2007. A rebound to p re -c r is is levels in cotton output was projected fo r 
2008. However the global financial crisis and fa l l ing cotton prices a re expected to exert 
significant p ressu re on the sector in the nea r to medium t e r m and further efforts to 
address structural weaknesses and the lack o f competitiveness in the sector w i l l be 
needed. 

15. 
The CAS identified a r o l e f o r I D A in strengthening and liberalizing the 
co t ton sector and increasing cotton yields. At the height o f the 2007 cotton c r i s i s 
(wh ich invo lved a 44 percent drop in cotton production, 14 percent slump in producer 
prices, reductions in farmer revenues and increased indebtedness o f cotton farmer 
cooperatives), and in response to Government requests, IDA’S response was escalated. 
Through the Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) series, support was given t o 
short-term recapitalization o f one o f t h e cotton companies, the implementation o f new 
producer price mechanisms, technical and financial support to the re-privatization 
process, and support measures to consolidate the cotton sector beyond the c r is is . The 

Agr icu lture D ivers iJ icat ion & M a r k e t Deve lopment P ro jec t (ADMDP ) also supported 

increased p roduc t iv i ty and farming system diversification initiatives. The upcoming 
C E M w i l l suggest mechanisms to mitigate climatic, commodity price and exchange rate 
r i s ks . Given the external climate and the significant vulnerability o f the cotton sector, 
sustained efforts to support ongoing reforms and to stabilize performance w i l l be crucial 
to the v iab i l i ty o f this sector. 

16. 
Progress towards economic diversification has been slow. 
The PRSP 
identified economic diversification as paramount to alleviating the over-reliance on the 
cotton sector and to expanding export earnings. The Government has focused o n the 

62 

p romo t ion o f mining, improved agricultural p roduc t iv i ty enhancing technologies and 
irrigated agriculture. Desp i te government efforts ( inc lud ing the fo rmu la t ion o f a ru ra l 
development strategy o n crop production diversification; t h e adoption o f standards fo r 
oilseed products and a l a w o n seed and technology trans fer ; and restructuration o f the 
Ministry o f Agriculture, Water and Fisheries), exports have stagnated at 9 percent o f 
GDP over the last decade, with the share o f cotton exports r is ing f r om 48 percent to over 
60 percent in some years. T o achieve diversification, the Government faces the 
significant challenge o f addressing a multitude o f interrelated constraints inc lud ing poor 
infrastructure, the high cost pub l ic services and u t i l i t i e s and inadequate policies and 
ins t i tu t iona l frameworks fo r private investment and export promotion. Given this and t h e 
recent focus o n cotton, the diversification process i s likely to take time. 

’ 

17. 

The Bank’s AAA support was instrumental in assisting the Government to 
identify areas for diversification. The Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS) 
suggested several measures to improve prospects fo r export diversification beyond cotton 
to products such as cattle and meat, sesame, gold, zinc, mangoes and c ra f t products. The 
C E M w i l l provide further guidance. Budget support under PRSC7 was in part directed 
towards the adoption and implementation o f an export p romo t ion strategy. However, the 
initiatives has been dampened by delays in the adoption and 
implementation o f a national export strategy. 

impetus o f these 

18. 
IDA ’S support in the agriculture sector has targeted the development o f key 
market-driven agricultural supply chains. 
The A D M D P supported 
fa rm ing 
cooperatives, expanded 
irrigation, 
improvements 
to productive and marketing 
infrastructure and improvements to the private investment regulatory and legal 
framework. The progress o f the project was hampered by an ove r ly ambitious project 
design and by complications in establishing an implementation structure. However, an 
intermediate plan o f action enabled the project to conclude key supply chain studies and 
to finance supply chain and i r r iga t ion m i c r o - p r ~ j e c t s ~ ~ and the project i s n o w achieving 
good progress towards i t s development objectives. The s tud ies and experiences o f the 
A D M D P w i l l underpin and guide Bank support to the diversification process in the 
upcoming CAS. 

19. 
The Bank adjusted its program to support the emerging export potential in 
gold mining. Due to the liberalization o f the sector in 1996 and support f r om the W o r l d 
Bank-funded M i n i n g Sector Capac i ty B u i l d i n g a n d Env i ronmen ta l Management P ro je c t 
(1998-2004), go ld m i n i n g has emerged as a p rom is ing export in Bu rk ina Faso. Mining 
production reached 5.2 tons in 2008 and i s projected t o g row by a further 8 tons by 2009. 
W o r l d Bank support during the CAS pe r iod has been directed towards assisting the 
Government t o manage the i n f l u x o f private sector investments. 
In response to 
Government reques ts in 2008, the CEDP project was restructured to enhance ins t i tu t iona l 
capacity and mon i to r ing capacities within the Ministry o f M ines . Through budget 
support, IDA i s p rov id ing technical assistance o n Bu rk ina Faso’s involvement in the 
Extractive Industries Transparency In i t ia t ive (EITI),

Im p r o v i n g the inves tmen t climate: 

20. 
Burkina Faso was ranked as one o f the top ten Doing Business performers in 
2009 f o r its business regulatory reforms, which formed part of a series o f reforms 
introduced by the Government to improve the investment climate. Th rough these 
re fo rms the Gove rnmen t has im p r o v e d contract enforcement, established t w o Business 
Reg is t ra t ion Centers (CEFORE), re fo rmed cons t ruc t ion p e rm i t processes and reduced

21. 
IDA ’S early analytic wo rk program brought investment climate constraints 
to the top o f the policy agenda4*. The Bank and I FC lending programs supported 
government progress in improving the investment climate. Budge t support was

22. 
Improving the investment climate and developing the financial system 
remain top priorities. In i t s latest Annual Progress Report, the Government heightened 
the importance of imp rov ing the investment climate. Development o f the private and 
finance sector, inc lud ing implementation o f an investment p romo t ion strategy and access 
t o finance fo r Small and Medium En te rp r ises (SMEs), are crucial to g row th and 
diversification. 

E f f ic ien t economic infrastructure: 

23. 
The Government has made some progress in developing efficient economic 
infrastructure to reduce factor costs and stimulate private sector investment. In 
transport, the Government has also played a lead role in coordinating donor activity. 
A l though a Road Fund has been established to ensure regular rehabilitation and 
maintenance o f the road network concerted government efforts t o ensu re adequate 
funding o f the Fund and to m in im ize inefficiencies in operation remain critical. 

24. 
Policy dialogue in the energy, telecommunications and petroleum sectors has 
promoted reforms to enhance infrastructure efficiency. The Bank’s investment 
lending has also directly enhanced transport and energy infrastructure. As part o f a 
consortium o f donors assisting the Government in rehabilitating and maintaining essential 
transport infrastructure, IDA financed the maintenance and rehabilitation o f 1 1 O O k m o f 
roads and supported institutional capacity bu i ld ing and structural re fo rm in supporting the 
development o f the Road Fund under the Transport Sector P ro jec t (TSP). As a donor o f 
last resort, the Bank funded tertiary and secondary roads w i t h l o w economic rates o f 
return, but h i g h social impact. The sustainability o f the Bank’s initiatives w i l l depend 
largely upon government efforts to ensure adequate financing o f the Road Fund. In 
energy, IDA collaborated with four other partners to support bo th the immediate power 
needs o f the country and longer-term economical energy measures under the Power 
Sector Development P ro jec t (PSDP). The project co-financed the construction o f an 
1 8MW power plant in 2006 and a regional interconnection transmission l i n e f r om C8te 
d ’ Ivo i re to Ouagadougou due fo r completion in late 2009. Co-financing fo r an 
interconnection with Ghana i s forecast fo r FY 10/11. In telecommunications, the CEDP 
project i s supporting the strengthening o f capacity o f the telecom regulatory body, 
ARTEL. 

25. 
Although the CAS indicated support fo r the development o f economic and market 
infrastructure in secondary urban areas, the subsequently designed D U C B funded 
technical assistance on ly and r e l i e d upon budget support fo r investment financing. 
Budgetary allocations fo r these infrastructure investments have on ly recen t ly been 
committed and i t i s therefore too early to assess progress. 

Regional Integration 

26. 
As a landlocked country, Burkina Faso has recognized its long-term 
economic interest in pursuing regional integration. I t serves as a host country fo r the 
headquarters o f W A E M U and President CompaorC held the rotating Presidency o f this 

65 

m a j o r sub-regional u n i o n in 2007. The Gove rnmen t has taken s ign i f ican t steps t o achieve 
greater reg iona l in teg ra t ion in several sectors, i n c l u d i n g energy and transport. 

27 . 
The CAS supported regional integration through measures aimed at 
improving trade with the sub-region. T h r o u g h the PRSCs and investment projects, 
IDA continues t o support B u r k i n a in reach ing WAEMU mac roeconom ic convergence 
c r i te r ia and ha rmon iz ing trade and economic po l ic ies within the c omm o n West A f r i c a n 
f ramewo rk . Reg iona l banking p ro jec ts have supported the B C E A O reg iona l paymen t 
system and strengthened reg iona l cap i ta l markets.

In pa r tne rsh ip with other donors, IDA has supported the development o f the West 
A f r i c a Powe r P o o l (WAPP ) w h i c h w i l l integrate na t iona l p ow e r systems i n t o a u n i f i e d

A l s o re levan t t o the outcome o f reg iona l in teg ra t ion are the Bank - f inanced

Supporting improved access to basic social services and social protection (pillar 2) 

30. 
Although Burkina Faso continues to rank poorly in the UNDP Human 
Development Index, i t has made consistent progress49. The C A S p e r i o d has been 
ma rked by pos i t ive trends in the social we l fa re indicators, no tab ly in im p r o v e d access t o 
basic services, regu la r increases in budgetary a l loca t ions and expenditures and better 
sector budget management. Howeve r , progress has been hampered by ins t i tu t iona l 
weaknesses and capacity constraints in t h e l i n e m in is t r ie s and issues re la ted t o the qua l i ty 
o f basic services persist. 

3 1. Administrative de-concentration and political decentralization continue to 
pose the greatest challenges to progress in this pillar. The f ramewo r k f o r de- 
concentration and decentralization lacks c la r i t y and the decen t ra l iza t ion o f basic services 

49 S ince 1980 , Burkina’s HDI value has r isen &om 0 .259 to 0 .372 , w i th a relatively high positive change 
ratio o f 0.055 over the period 2000-2006 

66 

has taken longer than expected to materialize. While limited trans fer o f competencies to 
communes has been effected, resource t rans fe rs are on ly just commencing. Creating 
incentives to motivate education and health professionals to move to ru ra l areas through 
the decentralization process represents a pa r t icu la r ly challenging issue . 

32. 
Sound progress has been achieved in reaching the CAS human development 
outcomes. The CAS supported Burkina’s human development goals by targeting access 
to the poo r to (i) basic education, (ii) health, nu t r i t ion and HIV/AIDS prevention and care 
services, (iii) potable water and sanitation services, and (iv) more extensive social safety 
nets. The reialignment in lending approach towards harmonized, multi-donor delivery 
mechanisms imp roved donor alignment with sectoral and sub-sectoral strategies, however 
implementation d i f f icu l t ies related t o inadequate adherence to country systems and weak 
communication amongst donors limited the effectiveness o f these approaches. A l though 
the CASPR identified support t o the decentralization process as a high p r io r i ty , the 
program cou ld have better-targeted support fo r decentralization in ind iv idua l social 
service l i n e ministries. 
Importantly, in FY09, sectoral budget support through the 
Education fo r A l l Fast-Track In i t ia t ive w i l l assist the Education ministry in implementing 
the decentralization agenda in the education sector. Given that decentralization i s n ow in 
i t s operational phase, in the upcoming CAS, greater focus o n building the capacity o f the 
loca l communes to manage their new responsibilities in social services w i l l be critical. 

Education: 

33 . 
Significant progress has been achieved by the Government in improving 
access to education, although issues relating to quality o f education and disparities 
in coverage continue to exist at a l l leve ls . The benchmark indicator fo r increasing 
national gross enrollment rate in p r ima ry education t o 70 percent in 2009 has been 
reached, however important disparities s t i l l exist between urban and ru ra l zones. Though 
the country continues to have one o f the lowest GER in post-primary in Africa, the GER 
in lowe r secondary education increased f r om 20 percent in 2006 to 28.4 percent in 2008, 
exceeding the target fo r 2008. Regular increases in education expenditures as a share o f 
the GDP f r om 2.6 percent to 2.9 percent between 2004 and 2007 have a l lowed the 
Government to expand teacher t ra in ing and upgrade schools with running water and 
sanitation facilities. The quality o f education services represen ts an ongoing stumbling 
b lo ck and i s reflected in the l o w literacy rates (28.3 percent), teacher absenteeism, poo r 
student to teacher ratios and the l o w l e v e l o f teaching hours. Teaching hours averaged 
640 hourdyear in 2007 compared to the national requirement o f 900 hours. 

34. 
I n primary education, the Government coordinated a harmonized sub-sector 
approach through the Ten Year P lan for the Development of Basic Education 
(PDDEB). The Bank supported these efforts by restructuring i t s existing basic education 
program at mid-term and directing i t s lending towards a harmonized mu l t i -dono r pooled 
PDD E B fund. The program has achieved sound resu l ts to date. B o t h GER and GIR 
indicators surpassed end-of-project targets. The number o f pub l ic school teachers also 
significantly increased, reaching 24,277 in 2007 (well beyond the 23,500 target se t fo r 
2009) and in-service training programs have had a positive impact o n learning outcomes. 

67 

The completion rate fo r primary education rose f rom 33 .5 percent to 41.1 percent in 
2007. 

35. 
W h i l e the sub-sector wide approach has helped to a l ign donor support behind a 
unified sub-sector strategy, significant implementation d i f f icu l t ies arose due to non- 
compliance with Bank procurement r u l e s and misunderstandings amongst donors as to 
t h e Bank’s fiduciary obligations. The program revealed the need to strengthen country 
financial management and procurement systems as a precondition fo r f u t u r e integration 
o f Bank programs in to country systems. Bu rk ina Faso i s n ow a p i l o t fo r use o f country 
financial management sys tems and i s being considered fo r inc lus ion as a p i l o t fo r use o f 
country procurement systems. The new Fast Track In i t ia t ive operation under the Bank’s 
supervision, wh ich w i l l be in the f o rm o f a Development Po l icy Operation, aims to 
further strengthen national fiduciary systems. The Bank’s experience under the education 
program also demonstrated the importance o f imp rov ing dialogue with donors t o arrive at 
common understandings with respect to donor expectations and internal constraints t o 
harmonization. 

36. 
I n secondary education the innovative public private partnership model was 
replicated during the CAS period as part of the IDA co-financed Post Primary 
Education Project 2 (PPEPII). The project i s on a satisfactory course to achieve i t s 
objectives in a l l components, inc lud ing the reduction in school fees, the de-concentration 
o f procurement management to regional levels and reforms in pre-service teacher 
training. PPEPII has also supported tertiary education reforms and vocational training. 
recently established International 
Institute for Water and Environmental 
Engineering Project (2IE) aims to target s k i l l s generation by increasing the number o f 
h igh ly skilled professionals in the areas o f water, energy, environment and infrastructure 
engineering. 

The 

37. Government efforts to integrate primary and secondary education and 
increase efficiency in educational spending have resulted in the adoption o f a 
consolidated medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) f o r the sector as a 
whole. The Bank’s PRSC ser ies contributed towards the finalization o f the MTEF. The 
recent Education Sector Review has assisted the Government in readjusting the national 
program towards the development o f the education sector as a whole. Add i t iona l 
financing under the PDEBB project in FY09 w i l l support implementation o f the sector 
review. Through the Education fo r A l l Fast Track Initiative, the Bank w i l l engage 
comprehensively in education po l icy dialogue. 

Health: 

38 . 
Health services have become more accessible. Positive trends in the health 
sector include improvements in vaccination coverage, reduced mo r ta l i ty rates f r om 
meningitis f rom 21 percen t to 8.5 percent between 2005 and 2006, reduction in 
HIV/AIDS mother to ch i ld transmission rates and a significant r i s e in the treatment o f 
people l i v i n g w i t h HIV/AIDS (beyond CAS and Government targets). D u r i n g the CAS

recent and most devastating outbreak occurred in 1996 and l e f t over 25,000 dead across 
the “Meningitis Belt” ( f rom Senegal to D j ibou t i ) and another 60,000 with severe 
neurological consequences. Epidemics occur every year, with more severe epidemics 
occurring every 8 to 12 years. 2008 was a particularly bad year fo r Bu rk ina Faso, with 
meningitis taking the lives o f nearly 8,400 people. When epidemics occur, health 
systems and health service personnel are often mob i l ized fo r weeks leaving regular 
patients to search or wait fo r care. Such situations are an indication o f the non 
preparedness o f countries to deal with emergencies. In the early stages o f the 2008 
epidemic, Bu rk ina appealed to donors fo r a more concerted and robust response to the 
c r is is , the donor community led by the Bank and UN ICEF responded quickly by allowing 
the country to use i t s existing credit proceeds to purchase 2.5 m i l l i o n doses o f vaccines 
through a direct financing with UN ICEF to make su re that the availability and quality of 
the vaccines were guaranteed. This crucial partnership prevented the deaths o f thousands 
fo r people. A f te r the c r i s i s was contained, the Bank then proceeded t o allocated an 
additional U S $ 5 M fo r the purchase o f additional vaccines t o prevent shortages in the 
event that another epidemic might occur. 

43. 
I D A financing supported marked improvements in the prevention and 
treatment o f HIV/AIDS. The underperforming HIV/AIDS Disaster Response Project 
was superseded b y the HSS/MAP pooled fund. Promising indicators include the 
reduction in HIV/AIDS prevalence f r om 7.17 percent in 1997 to 1.9 percent in 2008 and 
the substantial increase in persons receiving H IV tes ts ( f rom 37,638 in 2003 to 209,000 in 
2007). 
Importantly, the W o r l d Bank succeeded in j o i n i n g other donors in a pooled 
H I V / A I D s fund in 2008/9. 
IDA’S support o f the regional H I V / A I D S project has 
contributed to the development o f p i l o t strategies fo r strengthening country capacity t o 
scale up comprehensive care and treatment programs. 

Nutrition. A l though the CAS envisaged a ro le fo r the Bank in combating child 
malnutrition, Government coordination o f nu t r i t ion activities was i n i t i a l l y slow t o 
commence. The De te rm inan ts o f Ch i ld Ma lnu t r i t ion study forecast in the 2006 CAS was 
dropped. However, in the wake o f the food price c r i s i s and in response to r is ing levels o f 
malnutrition, nu t r i t ion became a primary concern and the Government escalated i t s 
coordination efforts. In response, additional IDA financing o f $10 m i l l i o n was secured 
fo r community-based health and nu t r i t ion activities wh ich a im to reach a minimum o f 15 
percen t o f the total population o f ru ra l children under five. Add i t iona l financing o f the 
PDDEB also targets school feeding programs. N o w that ma lnu t r i t ion has come to the 
fore o f the national agenda, the Bank w i l l need to consider continued multi-sectoral 
support. 

Water and sanitation: 

44. 
Burkina Faso i s on track to meet the MDGs related to access to potable 
water. The Government success fu l ly coordinated a multi-donor partnership to boost 

70 

large scale urban infrastructure in Ouagadougou. Support o f village water management 
and social water connection programs through the development o f public-private 
partnerships (PPP) between communities and the loca l private sector has also yielded 
results. Access to potable water has r i s e n to 77 percent in urban areas and 54 percent in 
ru ra l areas. Through the Na t iona l Water Supply and Sanitation Program (PN-AEPA), the 
Government has developed a sectoral strategy wh ich includes bo th urban and ru ra l 
dimensions. Notwithstanding progress in this sector, important disparities remain in 
access to safe d r ink ing water in ru ra l communities. 
Improvements to sanitation have 
included the development o f sanitation action plans in four 'c i t ies . However these have 
no t been implemented and sanitation plans fo r other cities are s t i l l outstanding. The 
Government has identified lack o f human resources as the ma in constraint to imp rov ing 
the implementation o f sanitation programs. 

45. 
I D A contributed to highly successfu l improvements to potable water access 
in Ouagadougou, under the $200 m i l l i o n multi-donor partnership coordinated by the 
Government. The Ouagadougou Water Supply p r o j e c t (OWS), wh ich closed in 
December 2007, exceeded i t s objective by successfully ensuring continuity o f the water 
s e r v i c e 24/7 and connecting 860,000 inhabitants t o the water distribution network in the 
capital c i ty . Importantly, the project also strengthened the institutional development and 
management capacity o f the national water utility, ONEA , resulting in increased b i l l 
collection, improved p roduc t iv i ty o f the commercial staff and alignment o f annual 
financial reports w i t h international standards. IDA w i l l continue to support harmonized 
initiatives under the national strategy through an urban water and sanitation project 
planned fo r FY09. In ru ra l areas, the Community-Based R u r a l Development P ro je c t 11 
(CBRD-11) financed community-identified w e l l and water pu r i f ica t ion projects. 

46. 
The PRSC se r ies supported legislative amendments to enhance private sector 
participation in water delivery in secondary urban and semi-rural areas. The 
PRSCs also advanced a new water management framework and assisted with the 
development o f sanitation strategic plans fo r secondary c i t ies . 

Social Protection Strategy 

47. 
I D A has supported the most vulnerable by targeting orphans and vulnerable 
children (OVCs) through its education and health projects providing affordable 
education, school feeding and school-based health care. The number o f OVCs 
receiving reduced o r free school fees doubled between 2005 and 2007. In the health 
sector, the HSS/HIV project has contributed to imp rov ing O V C access to care and 
support. In 2007, 30 percent o f OVCs received support. The W o r l d Bank 's CBRD - I1 
emergency seed distribution response in 2008 and additional funding to support nu t r i t ion 
campaigns in communities and schools helped to m in im ize the impact o f food price 
increases amongst vulnerable communities. 

48. 
Social protection and the development o f social safety ne ts w i l l be important 
i s s u e s in the upcoming CAS, due to the global economic downturn, the r is ing incidence 

71 

o f poverty and t h e heightened levels o f vulnerability to exogenous shocks. A review o f 
social safety ne ts i s under preparation. 

Supporting increased employment and income opportunities f o r the poor (pillar 3) 

49. 
The Government’s re fo rm o f labor market po l icy has advanced the national 
strategic objective o f imp rov ing employment opportunities. The Government has also 
demonstrated a strong commitment to imp rov ing income opportunities fo r the ru ra l poor 
through community-based ru ra l development and the adoption o f the Na t iona l Po l icy o n 
Land Tenure Security in Ru ra l Areas. 

50. Under the 2006 CAS, Bank support aimed t o target: i) enhanced labor market 
f lex ib i l i ty ; ii) increased economic opportunities fo r women; iii) reduced risk and 
increased revenues for ru ra l households; iv ) community-based land and natural resource 
management and; v) expanded access to ru ra l infrastructure. Progress has been achieved 
in respec t o f each o f these objectives. IDA’S contribution towards ru ra l development in 
Bu rk ina Faso, through the CBRD-11, has been particularly significant. 
Box 2 - Community Based Rural Development - a success story in Burkina Faso 
The Bank’s Community D r i v e n Development project in Bu rk ina Faso i s widely 
acclaimed as one o f the ‘success stories’ o f CAS implementation. Since the inception o f 
the first phase, the project has continued t o develop the capacity o f loca l communities to 
plan, manage and implement their own development plans. 
In support o f the 
decentralization process, the focus o f the project has extended to the development o f the 
capacity o f ru ra l communes nationwide. The support o f these structures has enabled the 
efficient and rap id implementation o f loca l development plans and projects. A 
noteworthy example invo lved the targeted distribution o f seed to ru ra l fa rme rs during the 
peak o f the food p r i ce crisis in 2008. 3,500 tons o f improved millet, sorghum, maize, 
beans and r ice seeds were distributed to 140,000 households in 302 communities in the 
country fo r a total o f $ 5 m i l l ion . The targeting o f households was carried out by the 
village councils, taking in to account the le ve l o f poverty and the impact o f flooding. 

Enhance labor market f l e x i b i l i t y fo r job creation 

51. 
Burkina Faso has recently stepped up initiatives to improve labor market 
flexibility through several decrees in 2007 which regulated overtime, dismissals and 
working hours. As a consequence, the D o i n g Bus iness Labor Market R ig id i ty Index 
rating fo r Bu rk ina has fallen f rom a last-place standing o f 90 to 61 in 2008 (although this 
i s s t i l l w e l l above the regional average o f 42.6 and the CAS 2009 target o f 50). A new 
labor code approving these changes was enacted in 2008. 

52. 
The Bank’s AAA support was instrumental in generating dialogue on labor 
market liberalization. The Labor Market Study, the ICA , the Regional ECOWAS 
Financial Market Review and the DTIS assisted the Government in iden t i fy ing key 
logjams to labor market f l e x i b i l i t y and guided the national re fo rm agenda. IDA financed 
projects have also directly contributed to j o b creation. For example, j o b creation 

72 

initiatives in SME credit l i n e supported the creation o f 1486 new jobs under the CEDP 
project. 

Enhanced Economic Opportunities fo r Women. 

53 . Government progress o n girls and women’s opportunities included the 
revision o f the national employment strategy, translation o f women’s rights in to loca l 
languages and improved women’s literacy in rural areas. A national po l icy fo r the 
p romo t ion o f women was adopted and disseminated in 2000 and the national gender 
po l icy was adopted in 2009. 

54. Many World Bank operations have had positive benefits for women and 
girls, especially in the education, private, agriculture and health sectors. Gross 
primary school enrollment reached 64.84 percent in 2008 and secondary enrollment 
reached 23.5 percent fo r girls. In the agricultural sector, support was g iven to women’s 
associations fo r production, marketing and processing, as well as access to technology 
geared to women’s income-generating activities. Under the ADMDP , o f the 992 m ic ro - 
projects approved by the selection committees in Ma rch 2008, 540 micro-projects were 
managed by women’s groups, o r ind iv idua l women. CBRD - I1 supports the empowerment 
o f gender-balanced village committees to define and implement lo ca l development 
projects, as well as literacy programs targeted at ru ra l women. The project has also 
contributed to increasing women’s awareness o f their rights 

55. 
Notwithstanding recommendations in the CASPR, Bank projects have no t 
successfully and systematically integrated gender in to their mon i to r ing and evaluation 
frameworks. G iven the central importance o f empowering women as a mechanism fo r 
addressing the population g row th dilemma in Burkina, further efforts to mainstream and 
track progress o n gender are called fo r under the new CAS. 

Reduced risk and increased revenues for ru ra l households 

56. 
Government efforts t o support income-generating activities and employment 
opportunities in ru ra l areas have included the implementation o f the small i r r iga t ion 
development program under the Na t iona l Po l icy fo r Sustainable Development o f Irrigated 
Agriculture, improved management o f cereal food stocks and the adoption o f the ru ra l 
land tenure po l icy . However, the vulnerability o f ru ra l communities calls fo r 
strengthened Government support to social protection mechanisms. Implementation of 
the ru ra l land reforms also remains critical. 

57. 
IDA ’S investment lending has supported revenue growth in rural areas. The 
micro-projects financed under the A D M P promoted contractual arrangements among 
supply chain operators to ensu re that fa rme rs receive a share o f the value added to the 
supply chains. The project also strengthened the capacity o f producers to address key 
constraints at their leve l and engage in fair and balanced partnerships with other 
stakeholders. I t yielded resu l ts in small-scale private i r r iga t ion production, increasing the 
income o f fa rme rs under the micro-projects by more than 30 percent. As identified by 
the ICR, under the Pa r tne rsh ip for N a t u r a l Ecosystem Managemen t P ro jec t (PAGEN),

the invo lvemen t o f l o c a l commun i t ies in ac t iv i t ies related t o the management o f protected 
areas (e.g. surveillance, reforestation, tourism) and the support t o na tu ra l resource-based 
income generating ac t iv i t ies (e.g. apiculture, aulacodiculture) resu l ted in a ma rg ina l 
increase in income among pe r iphe ra l communities. The f i r s t C B R D project, w h i c h ended 
during the 2006 C A S period, f inanced 18,250 l o c a l c omm u n i t y m ic ro -p ro jec ts selected 
by elected V i l l a g e Committees, thereby increasing r u r a l househo ld revenue and reduc ing 
vu lne rab i l i ty in the e f fec ted communities. T h e C BRD - I 1 p ro jec t i s s t i l l in the preparatory 
stages o f imp lemen ta t ion , howeve r th rough f inanc ing o f c omm u n i t y and commune

p roduc t ive capac i ty o f the r u r a l sector. The C BRD - I 1 also p r o v i d e d support t o the 
Government’s land tenure re fo rm . 

58. 
The Bank also supported risk management initiatives in order to stabilize 
and improve the livelihoods o f rural communities. These inc luded the r a p i d 
development o f a reg iona l early warning and response system f o r locus t in fes ta t ion and 
gradual imp rovemen ts t o land and water p rese rva t ion and b iod ive rs i ty th rough the 
P A G E N and Sahel Integrated Lowland Ecosystem Management (S I LEM ) projects. 

Commun i ty -based land and na tu ra l resource management 

59. 
The Government’s scaling-up o f community driven development 
mechanisms has achieved positive results in community-based land and natural 
resource management. 
IDA t o o k the lead in f inanc ing gove rnmen t commun i ty 
development in i t ia t ives under the C B R D p ro jec t . The f i r s t phase o f the project, w h i c h 
ended m i d -w a y th rough the C A S period, was highly successful. T h e p ro jec t assisted 
l o c a l commun i t ies t o imp lemen t and manage the i r ow n development plans. The second 
phase o f the p ro jec t has been re-oriented t o a l i g n better with the newly created 
decentralized adm in is t ra t ive structures. The p ro jec t w i l l con t inue t o support c omm u n i t y

committees (Conseil villageois de dkveloppement - CVD’s). 
60. 
Two projects were tailored to operate in connection with PNGT to enhance 
Bank support o f community-based land and natural resource management. T h e 
GEF f inanced P A G E N w h i c h ended in 2007 a imed t o reverse b iod ive rs i ty trends in

Expanded access to ru ra l infrastructure 

61. 
The Government has introduced important initiatives to improve access to 
rural infrastructure over the CAS period. In energy, the Government introduced a 
Ru ra l E lec t r i f ica t ion Strategy and established the E lec t r i f ica t ion Development Fund to 
promote, administer and superv ise rural electrification projects. 
In transport, the 
Government has committed to p rov id ing adequate funding fo r road maintenance. Ru ra l 
communities have also benefited f r om expanded access to telecommunication networks. 

62. 
I D A funding focused on improving access to rural infrastructure through 
targeted transport and energy interventions. The recently commenced Burk ina Faso 
Ru ra l Energy Access Project (REAP) aims to promote the use o f a spectrum o f 
innovative service delivery mechanisms fo r imp rov ing ru ra l electrification - through 
grid-based rehabilitation and expansion and the installation o f external ru ra l grids, 
thermal stand-alone grids, solar-based systems and multifunctional platforms. Capacity- 
bu i ld ing fo r cooperative and private sector participation forms an integral part o f the 
project. In transport, the IDA - f inanced TSP has facilitated improved access o f the poor 
to ru ra l infrastructure through the maintenance and rehabilitation o f secondary and 
tertiary networks. 

Supporting better governance with greater decentralization (pillar 4) 

63. Governance. Progress achieved b y the Government in the area o f governance 
included: (i) the adoption and implementation o f t h e Ac t ion Plan on the Na t iona l Good 
Governance Policy; (iii) the adoption and ongoing implementation o f an action plan 
based o n the Country Procurement Assessmen t Review (CPAR); (iii) the launching o f the 
A f r ican Peer Review Mechanism (MAEP) whose objective i s to encourage mutual s e l f - 
evaluation, mon i to r ing and learning; and (iv) the adoption in M a y 2006 o f a national anti- 
corruption policy. Importantly, in 2007, the Government committed t o step up efforts t o 
improve governance and transparency w i t h the establishment o f an independent audit 
ins t i tu t ion (ASCE). 

64. PFM: The Government also made considerable progress in the context o f pub l ic 
resource management with the introduction o f a broader integrated action plan t o 
strengthen pub l ic finances in 2007 (SRFP), the introduction o f computerized expenditure 
management systems in the regions; the preparation o f timely reports o n budget 
execution and adoption o f program budgets and MTEFs in key sector m in is t r ies . 

65. 
Decentralization: Progress has been slower than expected during the operational 
phase o f the decentralization process. Fo l low ing the Decentralization L a w o f 2004, 
elections fo r loca l governments (Collectivitds Territoriales - CT’s) were he ld in 2006. A 
legal framework and administrative decrees were introduced and p r io r i ty responsibilities 
covering most primary service delivery functions (primary education, safe water supply, 
basic health services etc.) were trans ferred t o the newly elected. Despite these s teps 
forward, the t rans fe r o f adequate funding and support has been s low and lack ing in 

75 

c la r i ty . CT ’s continue t o l a c k the means and resources t o p rope r ly plan and imp lemen t 
transferred mandates and ac t iv i t ies . In imp lemen t ing the decen t ra l iza t ion po l icy , fou r 
issues c r i t i c a l t o im p r o v e d service de l ive ry and pove r t y reduc t ion rema in : (i) adequate 
resource transfers t o the l o c a l l e v e l and ra t iona l iza t ion o f adm in is t ra t ive structures in light 
o f the n ew ins t i tu t iona l structure o f the state, (ii) capacity development at the l o c a l level; 
(iii) imp lemen ta t ion o f m o d e r n management 
too ls in the c i v i l service and (iv) 
strengthened l o c a l pa r t ic ipa t ion and mon i to r ing . 

66. 
An analysis o f the p o l i t i c a l economy in B u r k i n a Faso in 2008 reveals that the 
coun t ry s t i l l faces s ign i f ican t governance challenges characterized by cen t ra l ized 
dec is ion -mak ing power, l o w incen t ives f o r r e f o rm amongst actors with the strongest 
p ow e r and weak capacity o n the demand-side. 

67. 
The implementation o f this pillar of the CAS has had mixed results. The 
2006 C A S directed Bank support spec i f ica l ly towards the f o l l o w i n g outcomes: i) a m o r e 
e f f ic ien t j u d i c i a r y f o r comme rc ia l cases; ii) im p r o v e d p u b l i c resource management in a 
decentralized context; and iii) increased l o c a l capacity and pa r t ic ipa t ion in p u b l i c p o l i c y 
decisions. 
S ign i f ican t progress was achieved in the con tex t o f p u b l i c f inanc ia l 
management. Howeve r , the Bank ’s approach t o governance and an t i -co r rup t ion (GAC ) 
over the C A S pe r iod was fragmented. With im p r o v e d government owne rsh ip o f G A C 
issues since 2007 and the coun t ry ’s p o s i t i o n as a C G A C p i lo t , a mo re strategic and cross- 
sectoral approach t o GAC , cove r ing b o t h demand and supply aspects, i s wa r ran ted in the 
upcom ing CAS . 

M o r e e f f i c ien t i u d i c i a r v f o r comme r c ia l cases 

68. 
The Bank’s involvement in judicial reform has been limited. 
The IDA 
f inanced CEDP p ro jec t t ra ined 120 magistrates in business l a w be tween 2003 and 2008, 
exceeding o r ig ina l targets. Progress was also achieved in h a rm o n i z i n g Bu rk ina ’s 
business laws in l i n e with O H A D A standards and an a rb i t ra t ion and m e d i a t i o n centre 
within the Chamber o f Comme rce was established. 

Im p r o v e d p u b l i c resource management in a decentralized context: 

69. 
The Bank’s support o f public resource management has facilitated Burkina’s 
marked progress in this area. The PRSC series continues t o b e an e f fec t ive ins t rumen t 
in advancing the p u b l i c f inanc ia l management agenda, assisting p rocu remen t re fo rm ; 
budget de-concentration, expenditure management and budget con t ro l . The 2005 C P A R 
and 2007 Coun t ry F inanc ia lP rocu remen t Assessment (PEFA) reports we re the k e y 
assessments pe r fo rmed in recent years by the Bank. The Gove rnmen t has used the 
f ind ings o f these assessments t o update the budget management r e f o r m p rog ram 
(Programme de Re fo rme de l a Ges t ion Budgetaire). 
In terms o f P F M oversight, the 
p roduc t ion o f annual reports by the A S C E i s a pa r t icu la r achievement. The Public 
Con t ro l Institutions Project funded by IDF has helped t o re in fo rce the capacity o f con t ro l 
ins t i tu t ions t o imp rove p u b l i c f inanc ia l management ove rs igh t and reduce co r rup t ion . 
G i v e n that 68 percent o f aud i t reports in F Y 0 8 were considered n o t acceptable, fu r the r 

7 6 

strengthening o f the capacity o f bo th public sector control institutions and private audit 
f i r m s i s warranted. A new I D F project w i l l be developed this fiscal year to assist the 
CPA Board and a private audit firm assessment w i l l be carried out. 

70. 
Though important steps have been taken to improve the procurement and 
financial management regulatory framework, procurement reviews have revealed 
significant procurement and financial management capacity constraints. Bu rk ina 
Faso has been selected as a p i l o t country fo r initiatives to strengthen capacity and enable 
further use o f country financial management systems. Bu rk ina i s also being considered 
fo r inclusion as a p i l o t fo r use o f national procurement systems. The Government has 
indicated commitment to this process. 

71. 
As a key contributor to the decentralization strategy, the World Bank was 
positioned as a lead supporter o f decentralization in Burkina Faso throughout the 
CAS period, however financing has not, until recently, focused support o n the 
decentralized commune structures. The Bank’s support o f the decentralization process 
has been multi-faceted. Budget support and specific investment ins t rumen ts have 
promoted po l icy dialogue. 
IDA financing has also supported strengthening the 
institutional capacity o f central institutions and decentralized administrative s t ru c tu res 
(provinces, communes and villages) to implement the decentralization process. Until 
recently, however, the po r t fo l io gave l i t t l e direct support t o the communes. An ESW on 
Decentralization was carried out in FY 0 7 to assess the state o f the decentralization 
process. The findings o f that report have yet to be published however. 

72. 
Decentralization has featured as an important e lemen t in bo th PRSC series. 
Under PRSC 6 the framework fo r the t rans fe r o f resources and competencies to 
communes was finalized. Subsequent credits were directed towards the implementation 
o f the framework, however progress on this front has been s low and i s complicated by 
resistance to the re fo rm process. IEG acknowledged that the notwithstanding the slow 
pace o f implementation, the early PRSC ser ies were instrumental in accelerating progress 
towards decentralization. The same can be said fo r the PRSC series under the 2006 CAS. 

73. 
The ACBP has strengthened central institutional capacity in the context o f the 
decentralization process in four cross-cutting central m in is t r ies . The D U C B strengthened 
the capacity o f the ma in urban municipalities to take on the responsibilities trans ferred to 
them through the decentralization process with support to urban management capacity, 
financial resource mob i l iza t ion and financial management o f municipalities. The project 
assisted in the Government’s creation o f a fund fo r investment transfers (Fonds 
Permanent Pour L e DCveloppement des CollectivitCs Territoriales) in April 2007. 

74. 
In the ru ra l context, the CBRD - I1 project builds upon the successes o f CBRD and 
adapts to the emergence o f elected ru ra l communes by channeling funding through and 
supporting capacity bu i ld ing o f the communes. The project i s in the process o f financing 
crucial capacity training in the 302 ru ra l communes. D i rec t funding o f ru ra l commune 
and village development plans w i l l commence later in FY09 . 

77 

75. 
Despite multi-faceted support to capacity development, the impact o f Bank 
operations o n addressing systemic institutional and capacity weaknesses has been 
limited: In addition to capacity-building components in each o f the projects, IDA funded 
the ACBP as an overarching capacity development program t o support central ministries 
responsible fo r implementing pub l ic sector reform. The project supports decentralization, 
human resource management, public expenditure management and formulation, 
management and evaluation o f pub l ic policies in the th ree cross-cutting central ministries 
and the Prime M in is te r ’s Office. The project has suffered f rom a lack o f government 
ownership accompanied with a lack o f government spending in important areas such as 
c i v i l service performance management and 
t rans fe r o f competencies 
in the 
decentralization process. I t i s being re-structured t o improve the quality o f the indicators 
and enhance implementation efficiency. Desp i te instances o f improvement, globally the 
Bank’s initiatives have no t resulted in core institutional capacity development. A W B I - 
led retrospective w i l l be carried out on capacity development initiatives in the Bank 
program to strengthen the Bank’s strategic approach in the forthcoming CAS. 

The Development of 

the Na t iona l Stutisticul System Project (STATCAP) 

76. 
supported improvements to the central statistics agency through capacity-building, 
development of a legal and institutional framework and enhanced statistical 
infrastructure. Though the resu l ts o f the project are promising w i t h the number o f 
statisticians in training and the number o f workshops implemented reaching target, 
statistical capacity remains l o w in Bu rk ina Faso and represents a major constraint fo r 
effective mon i to r ing and evaluation in a l l sectors. 

Increased loca l capacity and participation in local po l icy decision making 

77. World Bank support to this outcome has focused upon direct empowerment 
o f citizens and loca l communities through the CBRD-I1 and DUCP. The CBRD - I1 
supported hundreds o f villages in the participatory preparation o f their loca l development 
plans. A Japanese Social Development Fund-financed project in FY09 w i l l introduce 
participatory mon i to r ing and evaluation mechanisms in to the health and education 
programs with a v iew to replicate the mechanism in other Bank projects. 

78. 
Contrary to indications in the 2006 CAS, the W o r l d Bank did no t engage in 
capacity-building o f c i v i l society to any significant degree and the inclusion o f c i v i l 
society in pub l ic decision-making, whilst encouraged by the W o r l d Bank, did not receive 
particular attention. CGAC consultations held in 2007 and a study on demand-side 
governance in Bu rk ina Faso have recommended increased Bank engagement with c i v i l 
society.

support credits under the second and third p rog ramma t ic series 
Imp lemen ta t ion o f the C A S outcomes also i n v o l v e d 4 c losed projects, 15 ac t ive p ro jec ts 
( inc lud ing 5 regional), 7 n ew p ro jec ts and 8 p ipe l ine projects. IDA and GEF are the m a i n 
sources o f funding in the f o r m o f either c red i ts o r loans. Annexes A and B compare the 
planned and actual deliveries o f non - lend ing and lending support during the C A S p e r i o d

(PRSC 5-8). 

80. Globally, the assessment o f the portfolio i s satisfactory with ove r h a l f o f the 
p ro jec ts considered satisfactory. There are n o unsatisfactory o r p r o b l em p ro jec ts in the 
p o r t f o l i o . There are, however, a numbe r o f p ro jec ts ra ted mode ra te ly satisfactory. In the 
case o f mode ra te ly satisfactory projects, 
f o u r k e y issues requ i re attention: des ign 
comp lex i ty ; g loba l imp lemen ta t ion progress; p ro jec t management and issues re la ted t o 
m o n i t o r i n g and evaluation. 
The po r t fo l io ’s o n l y past p r o b l em project, 
the 
Competitiveness and Enterprise Deve lopmen t Project, has been restructured. 

81. 

The Coun t ry P o r t f o l i o Performances R e v i ew (CPPR) conducted in October 2008 
revea led that the p o r t f o l i o i s p e r f o rm i n g w e l l above AFR r e g i o n averages, with g o o d

effective; (ii) s l ow p rocu remen t processes (related t o Bank delays in non-objections, s l ow 
m o b i l i z a t i o n o f the na t iona l counterpart and delays in s ign ing contracts a n d cumbersome

T h e r e v i ew recommended imp rovemen ts t o M&E systems, reduc ing c om p l e x i t y in 
p ro jec t design; enhancing synergies be tween sectors and res t ruc tu r ing p ro jec ts with wea k

(iii) strengthened government owne rsh ip in p ro jec t design; (iv) M&E support c l in ics ; and 
(v) support t o coun t ry f inanc ia l management and p rocu remen t systems. 

82. 

The disbursement ratio i s to some extent reasonable given that many projects 
are in fact only just commencing implementation and a few have received additional 
financing. As o f the 28 January 2009 , US$345 .6 m i l l i o n o f the t o t a l gross comm i tmen t 
o f US$530.38 m i l l i o n remains t o be disbursed. The re la t ive ly weak disbursement r a t i o 
takes 
i n t o account n e w p ro jec ts w h i c h have been approved but f o r w h i c h n o 
disbursements have been made. I f these p ro jec ts are excluded, the disbursement r a t i o f o r 
the rema inde r o f the ac t ive p ro jec ts i s 5 1 percent. This can be exp la ined i f one takes i n t o 
account the delay in execu t ion f o r many o f these p ro jec ts (generally 5 years). Gaps in 

7 9 

p ro jec t readiness con t r ibu te t o effectiveness delays and s l ow p ro jec t start up w h i c h 
impedes imp lemen ta t ion progress and, in turn, disbursement. 

b) 

Quality o f Products and Se rv ices 

83. 
Ove r the C A S period, the Qua l i t y Assurance G roup (QAG ) ra ted 3 p ro jec ts 
(Transport, Statcap and CEDP). The Transport and S T A T C A P p ro jec ts were ra ted 
mode ra te ly satisfactory o n quality at entry. Qua l i t y o f supe rv is ion was ra ted satisfactory 
f o r S T A T C A P and mode ra te ly satisfactory f o r the t w o other projects. 

84. 
I E G ratings o f Burkina Faso projects have improved over the last 5 years 
(particularly in the con tex t o f ins t i tu t iona l development) and exceed the A f r i c a n Reg iona l 
average. O f concern, however, i s the d rop in the outcomes and sus ta inab i l i ty ra t ings ove r 
the last three years. The coun t ry team i s presently r e v i ew i n g t h i s aspect o f the p o r t f o l i o . 
The Independent Eva lua t ion G r o u p (IEG) evaluated seven projects. F o r s i x o f them, IEG 
ra ted the Bank and B o r r ow e r performances as satisfactory o r mode ra te ly satisfactory and 
the risk t o development outcomes as moderate. W h i l e qua l i ty o f supe rv is ion was 
considered adequate f o r t w o projects, the qua l i ty at en t ry was considered unsatisfactory 
f o r one p ro jec t and su f f ic ien t f o r the other. A l l ICR s rev iewed we re ra ted satisfactory, 
with the excep t ion o f the Commun ity-Based R u r a l Deve lopment p ro jec t w h i c h was 
considered exemplary. 

c) 

Country Dialogue, Aid Coordination and Outreach Activities 

85. 
The country team has engaged in constructive dialogue with the Government 
throughout the CAS period. A n a l y t i c a l w o r k has supported d ia logue o n development 
p r io r i t ies and, in the case o f f i d u c i a r y wo rk , he lped the des ign o f the r e f o r m program. 
The PRSC series was the m o s t e f fec t ive instrument f o r sustained d ia logue o n p o l i c y 
p r io r i t ies and f o r assisting the Gove rnmen t t o address the challenges o f mac ro r e f o rm 
implementation. 

86. 
The presence o f in -coun t ry / in - reg ion TT L ’ s (5 T T L s and 1 c o -TT L ) im p r o v e d 
response times, interactions with the client, m o n i t o r i n g o f p ro jec ts and synergies be tween 
projects. Specialists in Health, Ag r icu l tu re , Energy, P r iva te Sector, Finance and 
Educa t ion also strengthened sectoral dialogue. The a r r iva l o f a n e w C o u n t r y Manage r 
has imp roved the coherence o f the Bank’s approach. 

87. Coordination with other donors has improved. B u r k i n a Faso has been a dono r 
coo rd ina t ion p i l o t coun t ry since 2003. One o f the cornerstones o f the C A S was the 
in tended sh i f t towa rds an inc reas ing ly p rog ramma t ic approach. Progress has been made 
especially in ha rmon i z ing approaches in education, health, H I V / A I D S and water supply. 
Howeve r imp lemen ta t ion d i f f i c u l t i e s remain. The establishment o f the j o i n t Cadre 
General d ’o rgan isa t ion BudgCtaires (CGAB ) has also resulted in deepening coo rd ina t ion 
o f donors in the con tex t o f budge t support th rough a l ignmen t o f p o l i c y advice, a j o i n t 
performance m a t r i x and annual progress reports. In i t ia t ives have also been taken in other 
sectors (transport and energy) t o a l i g n support beh ind c omm o n frameworks, a l though 

80 

further progress i s needed. Through involvement in the Technical Secretariat fo r Aid 
Effectiveness (STELA), the W o r l d Bank has been engaged with the donor community 
and the Government in applying the recommendations o f the recent H i g h L e v e l Fo rum on 
Aid Effectiveness in Accra. The W o r l d Bank i s also leading initiatives t o develop o f 
broad partnership o f donors with a v iew to creating a j o i n t assistance strategy upon the 
preparation o f the new PRSP. 

88 . Results f r om the 2008 Survey on Mon i to r ing Paris Declaration show that the 
Bank has made substantial progress toward the Paris Declaration targets but more efforts 
are needed to strengthen these achievements. The Bank i s o n track to meeting the Paris 
Declaration targets fo r u s e o f pub l ic financial; management (PFM) systems and has made 
progress on increasing lending through Program-Based approaches (PBAs) as we l l as 
conducting j o i n t analytic work. 

8 9 . 
The Bank’s experience in donor coordination du r ing the CAS pe r iod has raised 
th ree particular issues : (1) coordination r e l i e s upon effective national leadership; (2) the 
implementation o f country systems requ ires significant strengthening t o enable greater 
integration o f Bank support; (3) programmatic approaches tend to invo lve h i g h 
transaction costs and depend upon the development o f common understandings amongst 
donors with respect to fiduciary and mon i to r ing and evaluation expectations. 

90 . 
Client Survey. The resu l ts o f the client survey demonstrated that the overall 
impression o f Bank performance amongst clients and stakeholders i s good (6/10). The 
effectiveness o f the Bank in supporting poverty reduction was also rated h igh ly (7/10). 
Respondents l i s t e d financial resources and economic and po l i cy advice as the two most 
important aspects o f Bank support to Bu rk ina Faso. 75 percent o f respondents considered 
that the W o r l d Bank’s requirements fo r accessing finance should be simplified. 

91. 
Engagement with private sector, civil society and outreach activities. The 
W o r l d Bank’s outreach activities have 
included pub l ic university 
lectures, 
communication open-house sessions with journalists and sporadic consultations with c i v i l 
society. C i v i l society remains relatively poo r ly in fo rmed about the W o r l d Bank’s wo rk 
in Bu rk ina Faso. A regular outreach program with c i v i l society has been proposed as a 
means o f imp rov ing in fo rma t ion dissemination and dialogue. The JSDF-financed project 
w i l l also support lo ca l participatory monitoring o f Bank projects. Du r ing the preparation 
and progress review o f the FY 0 6 CAS, the Bank engaged in extensive consultations with 
private sector, c i v i l society and partners across th ree regions. The Bank also engaged a 
broad spectrum o f stakeholders during the recent retreat in October 2008 which included 
a po r t fo l io review, an assessment o f performance under the F Y 0 6 CAS and brainstorming 
on the direction o f the upcoming CAS. 

D. I F C and M I G A 

92 . 
I FC . IFC’s strategy fo r Bu rk ina Faso focused o n (i) imp rov ing the investment 
climate through the D o i n g Bus iness Be t te r Program; (ii) capacity-building fo r medium- 
size-enterprises and support to financial institutions to a l low them t o cater to the SME

segment;, (iii) p rov id ing direct technical support t o medium-size en te rp r ise s operating in 
sectors that have positive externalities on other related sectors (e.g. agriculture, 
construction, transport); and, (iv) proactive support for project development in the 
financial, hospitality, infrastructure and m in ing sectors. 
In agriculture, I FC and the 
Wo r ld Bank worked with the Millennium Challenge Account to develop a program to 
increase agricultural productivity by using loca l banks to support farmers . In transport, 
the IFC and the W o r l d Bank engaged in dialogue with the Government on the new 
airport. 
I FC sponsored a study to review the Government’s new airport proposal and 
public private partnership options. 

93. 
Specific investments included a US$6 m i l l i o n credit l i n e and TA funding o f 
US$141,000 to support the establishment o f new micro-finance subsidiary o f BACB ; a 
Euro 7.5 m i l l i o n loan to Onatel S.A., to a l low the telecom operator expand i t s activities; 
and a US$5 m i l l i o n trade finance l i n e to Ecobank Bu rk ina as part o f an investment

94. M IGA . MIGA’s po r t fo l io in Bu rk ina Faso consists o f 1 project, in support o f the 
country’s tourism sector, with a gross exposure o f US$3.3 m i l l ion . The Agency issued 
guarantees (against the r i s k s o f t rans fe r restriction, expropriation and war and c i v i l 
disturbance) to a Ma l ian investor fo r i t s equity investment and loan guarantee toward a 
hotel renovation and expansion. The project aims to support the country’s efforts t o 
establish i t s e l f as a regional center fo r business tourism. I t i s expected to: (i) create loca l 
jobs; (ii) trans fer knowledge; (iii) support the growth o f small and medium-size 
businesses; and (iv) generate an increase in ta xe s and foreign exchange fo r the 
Government. This investment i s also a j o i n t collaboration between I FC and MIGA. 
Du r ing FY09, MIGA i s wo rk ing with Canadian investors to provide guarantees fo r their 
investment in a go ld m in ing project in Bu rk ina Faso. 

9 5 . WBI: Bu rk ina Faso continues to be an active participant in W B I programs, 
particularly in the area o f sustainable land management and natural capital, as w e l l as 
education. Several participants f rom Bu rk ina Faso also attended W B I Regional events 
thereby learning f r om and sharing development experiences with others in the Region. 
There are no specific country-level programs currently planned fo r FY09, however i t i s 
expected that a number o f regional events w i l l attract participation f rom Bu rk ina Faso. 

96. 
Burkina Faso i s a pilot country f o r the development of a joint World Bank 
Group CAS (Wo r ld Bank, IFC and MIGA) in 2009. 

E. KEY LESSONS LEARNED 

The fo l low ing lessons can be learned f rom the 2006 CAS: 

1. G iven that the CAS aligned support across every pillar o f the PRSP, t h e country 
program wou ld have benefited f r om greater se lect iv ity t o enhance impact and 
visibility o f bank interventions. The CAS did not achieve i t s stated objective o f 

82 

simplifying the coun t ry program, 
operations increased. 

indeed the number o f active-country-based 

2. To m a x im i z e the e f f ic ien t use o f Bank resources, a stronger focus on inter-sectoral 
coordination at the coun t ry l e v e l i s warranted. Closer cooperation between sectoral 
teams t o harness the complementarities and synergies be tween sectors and projects 
w o u l d have imp roved the coun t r y program’s coherence and better re f lec ted the 
in te r re la ted and m u t u a l l y r e i n f o r c i n g nature o f the PRSP objectives t o w h i c h the C A S 
aligned. 

3 . While budget support proved effective in advancing dialogue at the macro leve l , 
i t proved less effective in the context o f sectoral reforms. Consistent progress was 

made in areas under the d i rec t con t ro l o f the central ministries, no tab ly the Ministry 
o f Finance, whereas progress was uneven where r e f o rm imp lemen ta t ion depended 
u p o n the capacity and invo lvemen t o f pa r t icu la r l i n e m in is t r ies . T h e PRSC series, 
w h i c h cove red a m u l t i t u d e o f d i f fe ren t re fo rms across the budget, c o u l d have 
bene f i ted f r o m ta rge t ing k e y re fo rms at the mac ro level. 

4. W h i l e in theory, parallel TA projects are an e f fec t ive comp lemen t t o budge t support, 
in p rac t ice they have l i m i t e d impac t where budgetary a l loca t ions are n o t fo r thcom ing 
f o r the pa r t icu la r a c t i v i t y t o w h i c h the TA i s t i e d o r where the sequencing o f 
budgetary a l loca t ions and suppo r t ing TA i s p o o r l y timed. 

5 . Government ownership i s v i t a l t o the effectiveness o f in te rven t ions . A stark 
contrast can be d r aw n be tween in te rven t ions w h i c h lacked ownership, such as the 
av ia t ion safety p ro jec t and those w h i c h we re supported by p o l i t i c a l w i l l ingness such 
as in the D o i n g Business p rog ram and the urban water p ro jec t . 

6. Donor harmonization and coordination. Budge t support th rough the PRSC series 

s ign i f ican t ly im p r o v e d dono r coo rd ina t ion . P rog ramma t ic approaches in basic 
services were successful inso fa r as they a l igned dono r support behind na t iona l 
sectoral po l ic ies . H ow e v e r s ign i f ican t weaknesses in the imp lemen ta t ion o f coun t r y 
systems continue t o represent a m a j o r obstacle. Fu tu re in teg ra t ion o f the Bank 
p ro jec ts and p rog rams th rough use o f coun t ry systems w i l l requ i re ma r ked 
imp rovemen ts t o coun t ry f inanc ia l management and procurement systems. The Bank 
i s in a strong p o s i t i o n t o p romo te dono r d ia logue and a l ignmen t in the con tex t o f 
budget support and th rough sectoral w o r k i n g groups. 

7. Successful diversification depends on overcoming a multitude o f obstacles 

(infrastructure, p r i va te sector development, transport, expo r t po l ic ies etc) and requires 
the adop t ion o f a tightly integrated approach. Experience unde r the C A S shows tha t 
i t w i l l take time t o achieve d ive rs i f ica t ion . 

8. The development challenges posed by Burkina Faso’s rapid and uncontrolled 

population g r ow t h need t o be be t te r understood and addressed by the Gove rnmen t 

and the W o r l d Bank. 

83 

9 . Burkina Faso’s decentralization process ho lds the key t o im p r o v i n g access t o and 
qua l i ty o f basic services. Adequate f inanc ia l au tonomy and s t rong ins t i tu t iona l 
capacity are c ruc ia l t o the p rope r func t ion ing o f decentralized structures. 
context, d i rec t support t o communes needs t o be enhanced. 

In this 

10. The successful CDD approach has demonstrated that empowered commun i t ies are 
capable o f manag ing and m o n i t o r i n g their own development. Commun i ty -d r iven 
development in i t ia t ives l e d by the Bank during the C A S p e r i o d represent a k e y Bank 
achievement w o r t h y o f fu tu re rep l ica t ion . 

11. Institutional capacity continues to be a major stumbling block to aid 
effectiveness and development. The Bank needs t o i d e n t i f y better targeted and m o r e 
extensive in te rven t ions geared towa rds longe r t e r m strategic capacity development 
objectives. 

12. Tackling governance issues requires a more consistent and comprehensive 
program-wide approach which targets both supply and demand sides. Though 
the mandate o f the W o r l d Bank restricts the po ten t ia l scope o f interventions, the 
p reva i l ing p o l i t i c a l m om e n t um o n G A C issues shou ld be harnessed.

Appendix C: The Unfolding Crisis in the Cotton Sector 

The cotton sector i s in t h e midst o f another crisis. The sector, which has no t fully recovered 
f r om the last crisis in 2004 -2006 that led to the recapitalization o f SOF ITEX in 2007 and Faso 
Coton as well as SOCOMA in 2008, n ow faces impending bankruptcy in the cotton companies, 
heavily indebted fa rme r and village cooperatives who are unable t o make profitable activity f r om 
cotton (un less key financial parame ters such as fa rm gate price, p r i c e o f fertilizers, indebtedness 
and status, improve soon) and l o w productivity wh ich risks diminishing further i f producers 
withdraw f r om the sector. 

Cotton companies are expecting significant losses this campaign due to the drop o f cotton 
prices o n world markets and w i l l likely be forced to recapitalize by October 2009 to avoid 
bankruptcy. After being recapitalized in 2007, SOFITEX and Faso Coton have again 
accumulated significant losses during the 2008/2009 cropping campaign amounting to over 50 
percent o f their capital. 
International bids in early April 2009 were between CFAFSOO and 
CFAF5 lO/kg o f fibber cotton, significantly be low the break-even po in t fo r cotton companies, 
estimated at between CFAF680 to CFAF73Okg. Due to the companies’ l im i ted use o f fo rwa rd 
contracts at the s ta r t o f the campaign to s e l l t h e i r upcoming production o f fiber cotton when 
wo r ld prices were significantly higher, Burkina’s th ree ginners s t i l l had a l o t o f unsold cotton at 
the end o f the 2008/2009 campaign. The lack o f sale contracts, a collateral requirement fo r the 
banking pool, further complicated the access o f cotton companies to their l i n e o f c red i t fo r the 
financing o f the 2009/2010 campaign. W h i l e wo r ld prices partly recovered at the end o f April, 
they remain be low the break-even point. The cotton companies have n ow resumed sales, w h i c h 
allowed banks t o disburse credits fo r the new campaign, however a significant financial de f ic i t i s 
expected f r om the th ree cotton companies fo r the crop year as a whole. The losses sustained are 
enough to trigger the O H A D A l aw o n liquidation. SOFITEX’s management i s proposing to 
carry out a three-phase financial restructuring to: (i) reduce i t s capital; (ii) revalue i t s fixed 
assets; and (iii) receive a state contribution o f CFAF16 b i l l i o n (about US$32 m i l l ion ) on the j o i n t 
current account i t owns w i t h the Government. Faso Coton and SOFITEX w i l l l i k e l y seek 
recapitalization f rom the private sector. Injections o f liquidity may also be needed given that the 
banking p o o l i s forcing the cotton companies to c la r i fy options fo r bus iness continuity now, 
rather than in the fall, as a necessary condition to authorize access to their l i n e o f credit fo r the 
2009/20 10 campaign. 

Heavily indebted producers face another difficult cropping season and risk dropping out o f 
the sector. A significant proportion o f internal debt has been accumulated over the last few 
cropping cycles and appears to be closely associated with the occurrence o f adverse climatic 
events in 2006/2007 and 2007/2008. Approximately 25 pe rcen t o f producers are affected by 
debt, with a debt total o f 4.3 b i l l i o n CFA (approximately US$8 m i l l ion ) o f wh ich 2.8 b i l l i o n 
CFA was accumulated in the 2007/2008 season alone. A study carried out b y the cotton 
producer association (UNPCB) shows that about 22,000 producers are indebted toward their 
cotton producers group, but that as much as 100,000 producers may have been affected through 
their contribution to the existing solidarity guarantee groups. As a resu l t o f e i the r their 
indebtedness o r because they redistributed their profit 
last year through the solidarity 
mechanism, a significant proportion o f f a rm e r s (15 to 20 percen t overall, up to 30 percent in 
some areas) have renounced growing cotton this coming campaign. Conditions during the 

102 

2008/2009 campaign risk aggravating this withdrawal f rom production. So lvab i l i ty constraints 
of the cotton companies f rom the late sale o f cotton contracts have delayed payments t o 
producers wh i ch are n ow on ly expected to be completed in July 2009 - well in to the next 
cropping campaign. Contrary to expectations until June 2008, producers w i l l no t receive an 
additional p r ice (“ r is tou rne” ) on top o f the f loo r price o f CFAF165Ikg o f seed cotton. The new 
f loo r price fo r the 2009/20 10 season w i l l be even lower given developments on wo r ld markets, at 
CFAF lGOkg (3 pe rcen t less than last year). Furthermore, fertilizer prices have on ly marginally 
decreased this year, suggesting an increase in the overall input price (hiked up by financing 
costs). 

The global financial cr is is has catalyzed the current c r i s i s in the cotton sector. The impact 
has resulted in a drop in cotton prices o n the international market due to declining demand, 
increased input prices and more limited access to and higher costs o f credit. However, the 
origins o f the crisis are rooted in underlying structural problems related t o the lack o f 
competitiveness in the sector and limited on-farm productivity. Any response t o deal with the 
existing debt o f fa rme rs and cotton companies in the short t e rm w i l l therefore need to be 
embedded in a broader program o f structural re fo rm and improved competitiveness within the 
sector: 

The Government i s putting together a sound emergency package to respond to the cr is is , 
with a focus on immediate measures to save the coming cropping campaign (2009/2010). 
The Government’s objective i s to encourage seed cotton production at i t s 2008/2009 l e v e l 
(452,000 T) in the coming campaign, w i thou t distorting long-term incentives set by the price-

extending the production o f GM cotton with the sowing o f 120,000 ha in 2009/2010 and 
the coverage o f the en t i re cotton area in 2010-201 1 by this technology expected to r e s u l t 
in approximately a 30 percent increase in y ie ld and an economy o f 4 insecticide 
treatments per campaign. 
increasing subsidies fo r fertilizers, subject to availability o f funds, so that input costs t o

In total, the Government’s intervention package to save the coming cotton campaign could 
amount t o above C F A F l 1 b i l l ion , roughly equivalent to US$23 m i l l ion , with another contingent 
l iab i l i ty o f US$32 m i l l i o n to guarantee SOF ITEX ’S bus iness continuity.

A three year action plan to improve the sector’s competitiveness i s also envisaged. The plan 
w i l l address underlying structural problems in the sector, inc lud ing the managerial efficiency o f 
cotton companies, improved management o f the Price Smoothing Fund, reduction in the cost o f 
fertilizer possibly through a rotating input financing fund and longer t e r m solutions to producer 
indebtedness. The plan w i l l also focus on the r o l l out o f Bt cotton in accordance with biosecurity 
safeguards to increase overall production volumes above the c r i t ica l threshold o f 500,OOOmt 
needed to boost u t i l iza t ion ratios o f installed processing capacity above the m in ima l leve l 
required to arrive at internationally competitive unit processing costs. 

The World Bank has responded rapidly to the cr is is with financial and technical support 
and remains flexible to providing further support. Through the PRSC series, IDA delivery 
was increased and accelerated in 2009 in order to help Burkina’s exceptional budgetary 
financing needs and support the Government’s emergency po l i cy re fo rm and ins t i tu t ion 
strengthening response to the cotton crisis. Add i t iona l support i s envisaged in the CAS.

Appendix D: Improving the Doing Business Indicators 

Over the 3 last years, major reforms achieved related to bus iness s ta r t up, property registration, 
labor, tax regime, construction pe rm i ts . This resu l ted in an outstanding increase o f Burkina’s 
ranking in the D o i n g Bus iness Report f rom 163 out o f 175 countries in 2007 t o 148th o f 181 
countries in 2009. This achievement i s particularly notable as t h e country was also ranked 
amongst the top 10 reformers globally in 2009. 

Desp i te achievements, reforms need to be furthered and accelerated in order to improve 
Burkina’s overall ease o f doing bus iness index and ranking. Reforms related to trading across 
borders i s a p r io r i ty g iven that Bu rk ina Faso recorded i t s poorest performance in t h i s domain. 

The I FC “Doing Bus iness Be t te r in Bu rk ina Faso” program has launched supportive sub-

Appendix E: Overview o f the Etude du Scheina National D’Amgnagement du Territoire 

(SNAT) 

By the Na t iona l Po l icy on Land Planning Decree (Decre t N o 2006 - 362), the Government o f 
Bu rk ina Faso commissioned the Na t iona l Land Planning Scheme (SNAT). The SNAT’s mission 
i s t o introduce bo th a long t e rm perspective and territorial coherence t o the development debate 
in Bu rk ina Faso b y mapping development r i s k s and opportunities. The SNAT involves a th ree 
staged process: (a) a geographical diagnostic o f national development issues; (b) an iden t i f ica t ion 
o f the major concepts, objectives and directions fo r sustainable development in Bu rk ina Faso; (c) 
the validation by Government o f a te r r i to r ia l ly coherent 20 year national development strategy 
for Bu rk ina Faso. This appendix provides an overview o f the diagnostic and second phase 
elaboration o f the SNAT. The Government i s yet to validate the SNAT . 
Context - national realities 

The SNAT diagnostic underscores the impact o f Burkina’s unsustainable population g row th and 
land degradation. Burkina’s population has tripled in the last 30 years and agricultural g row th 
has r e l i e d upon the degrading expansion o f land fo r cultivation (at a rate o f 3 percent per year). 
I t warns that the nation i s fast-approaching spatial saturation and over population, which w i l l 
have dire consequences fo r Burkina’s food security, socio-economic and human development 
and socio-territorial harmony. 

The SNAT emphasizes the importance o f developing a long t e r m national po l i cy wh ich i s no t 
founded on poverty reduction alone. The focus should be to ha rne ss the nation’s d ign i ty and 
enable Bu rk ina to s tee r i t s ow n direction. Burkina’s transition towards development i s a long 
process. The next 20 years ought t o be conceived as a transition period in wh ich the country 
embarks upon the significant task o f reversing negative trends. The SNAT indicates that this 
w i l l be a difficult period wh i ch w i l l yield few tangible resu l ts . 

Fundamental Challenges: 

Demography and the Ro le of Women 

Bu rk ina Faso i s situated at the s ta r t o f phase two o f the demographic transition chart, with 
persistently h i g h birth rates and lowe r ing death rates. Annual g row th rates are between 2.5 to 3 
percent, resulting in a doubling o f the population every generation. Current population i s 
estimated at 13.73 m i l l ion . In order to reach sustainable population growth, Bu rk ina needs to 
develop a clear and decisive national strategy to maintain i t s population be low 20 m i l l i o n by 
2025. This w i l l require a reduction in the population growth rate f i om 2.5 percent to 1.9 percent 
in 2015 and 1.4 percent in 2025. The SNAT iden t i f ie s two key e lemen ts t o curbing population 
growth: (1) intensive fam i ly planning and improved access to quality broad-based health services 
fo r women; and (2) modernizing societal attitudes towards the ro le o f women, inc lud ing their 
economic participation, rights and social insertion. 

107 

Education 

The SNAT envisages the creation o f a new, educated and technically trained ru ra l population, 
capable o f imp rov ing agricultural productivity. The SNAT warns that the focus on increasing 
access to education has negatively impacted upon the quality o f education. Teacher-student 
ratios are a key challenge. To sustain quality education, the number o f teachers needs to increase 
by 8.5 percent per year until 2025. The SNAT recommends that secondary education initiatives 
should be expanded in areas wh i ch demonstrate good potential. Tertiary education and research 
needs to b e properly aligned with the needs o f the country and the existing university poles 
require reinforcement. Bobo-Dioulasso i s identified as a prime candidate fo r becoming a pole o f 
excellence fo r research and education in agricultural activities and agro-processing industry. 

Ag r icu l tu re and its integration w i t h livestock 

The SNAT emphasizes the importance o f developing food self-sufficiency rather than food 
security (wh ich includes the concept ‘ o f imports) in Bu rk ina Faso. 
I t highlights the need to 
increase p roduc t iv i ty o f traditional food crops (millet, sorghum) and products o f good potential 
( r ice and potatoes). 
I t also recommends (i) the integration o f agriculture and livestock to 
improve manure usage, (ii) imp rov ing land management in cotton cultivation; and (iii) 
harnessing the unrealized potential o f Burkina’s f e r t i l e shoal (bas fond) regions, with the a im o f 
extending cu l t iva t ion to an additional 300 000 ha o f bas fonds in 20-25 years. 

Environment and L a n d Tenure 

The environment and land tenu re re fo rm feature as central and over-arching preconditions fo r 
sustainable development. The SNAT indicates that, contrary to common perceptions, Bu rk ina 
Faso does not lack water resources, instead the major constraints relate to regionally 
disproportionate and irregular rains and poor water resource management. The SNAT 
commends the preparation o f the Na t iona l Rural Land Tenure Re fo rm Policy, but raises concern 
over the implementation o f the land reforms. The SNAT recommends a staged land re fo rm 
implementation process, in vo lv ing the immediate identification o f p r io r i ty areas e.g. bas-fonds 
areas, zones o f con f l ic t over land tenure. 

Decisive factors 

The SNAT iden t i f ies th ree decisive factors wh ich w i l l direct the course o f Burkina’s 
development: (1) urbanization; (2) desenclavement; and (3) water and energy. Burkina’s current 
urbanization rate o f 20 percent falls well be low those o f other Sahe l ian countries. Ru ra l 
communities remain cut o f f f rom markets due to the l o w urbanization rates and poor internal 
connections. 78 percent o f agricultural products do not reach markets, 15 percent reach markets 
connected to the ru ra l road networks and on ly 7 percen t reach urban markets. The SNAT 
highlights the importance o f well-managed and progressive urbanization fo r development. I t 
recommends particular focus should be placed o n internal desenclavement and farm to market 
access (80 percen t o f the population are ru ra l ly based and the road network services on ly 22 
percent o f the country). I t also highlights the importance o f extending external r a i l connections 
(recommendations include: (i) extend r a i l Abidjan, Ouagadougou, Kaya up t o Do r i ; (ii) link 
Bobo with M a l i through Koloko; (iii) resurrect dialogue on the r a i l project to connect with 

108 

Ghana; (iv) implement a r a i l link with Benin-Niger v ia Fada N’Gourma). 
renewable energy sources, regional energy interconnections and water management are also 
discussed. 

Investments in 

Vectors o f growth 

The SNAT draws upon the opportunities that e x i s t w i th in different regions and iden t i f ie s good 
g row th potential in industry, mining, tourism and handicrafts. 

The SNAT proposes the gradual creation o f different ‘zones o f activity’ t o stimulate well- 
planned urbanization, j o b creation and growth. Several zones are suggested, including: ru ra l 
micro-centers, the grouping o f particular s k i l l s around particular villages, industrial zones, 
logistical export platforms and business districts. 
In the context o f tourism, the SNAT 
recommends harnessing the small potential niche market by crating 5 regional tourism hubs in 
Fada NGourma, Do r i , Ouahigouya, Bobo-Dioulasso and Ouagadougou. The creation o f these 
zones w i l l requ i re close coordination with ru ra l communes and supportive land reforms. 

Cross-cutting issues 

Tw o cross-cutting issues are identified in the SNAT. The c red ib i l i ty and effectiveness o f the 
State w i l l depend upon clear delineation o f regional responsibilities. The SNAT also proposes a 
new system o f international cooperation with regional neighbors and donors. Bu rk ina needs to 
deepen i t s engagement with regional neighbors and assume a more prominent leadership pos i t ion 
in steering donor interventions. 

The SNAT map 

The SNAT mapping exercise spatially depicts geographic constraints (ecological and over- 
population) and opportunities ( f e r t i l e regions, bas fonds, concentration o f h i g h potential 
products, markets, infrastructure, transport, areas o f urbanization, mining, tourism, transborder 
commercial exchange areas etc)) fo r development in Burkina. I t does not cover social services 
wh ich ought to be equally distributed. The map reveals that population density does no t 
correlate with the most f e r t i l e rain-fed areas. This i s largely due to historical and t r iba l factors. 
The map also shows that over-population predominantly affects the central band o f the country.

Appendix F: Policy note on Regional Growth Poles (May 2009 ) 

1. 
The objective of this note on growth poles i s to elaborate on the spatial approach 
adopted under the first strategic theme of the proposed Country Assistance Strategy FY10- 
12, relating to intensification and diversification o f the economy. T h e no te i s in tended t o 
p rov ide a q u i c k ove rv iew o f the theoretical underpinnings o f the g r ow t h p o l e approach, o f 
experiences in other countries, current p o l i c y o r ien ta t ion and ex is t ing studies in Bu rk ina . The

The Growth Pole Concept 

2. 

The principal objective o f a growth pole i s to develop economic activities around one 
o r multiple industries o r sectors o f potential, by ta rge t ing a c r i t i c a l mass o f investments 
(economic infrastructure, p r iva te sector development, ins t i tu t iona l reforms, po l ic ies t o support 
enterprise and industry). The purpose o f deve lop ing a p o l e i s t o catalyze va lue added ac t iv i t ies 
and t o encourage clusters o f entrepreneurial investment. G i v e n the right conditions, enterprises 
are likely t o reg roup i n t o clusters t o imp rove organization, coo rd ina t ion and competitiveness so 
that they can compete m o r e e f fec t ive ly in external markets. The f o rm a t i o n o f entrepreneurial 
clusters facilitates shared use o f the means o f p roduc t ion (treatment o f surplus p r o d u c t i o n by one 
enterprise t o a v o i d the losses o f another) and c omm o n t ra in ing o f actors o r techn ica l support 
targeted at enterprises situated within the pole. The essential characteristics w h i c h determine the 
competitiveness o f enterprises in g r ow t h poles, acco rd ing t o N a d v i (1 999) are: access t o markets, 
f l e x i b i l i t y and ava i lab i l i ty o f human capital, 
the effects o f in te rmed ia te consumption, 
techno log ica l advances and, j o i n t ac t ion by enterprises t o associate o r collaborate with a c omm o n 
purpose. 

3. 

The development o f a growth pole can either be initiated by the spontaneous 
regrouping of enterprises and other actors in the same domain o r promoted by specific 
public policy. The State’s r o l e in p r om o t i n g g r ow t h po les i s one o f fac i l i ta to r and coo rd ina to r

competitiveness. A strategy f o r g r ow t h p o l e p r om o t i o n shou ld identify spec i f ic measures t o 
remove constraints, im p r o v e q u a l i t y and p roduc t iv i ty , encourage domestic and in te rna t iona l 
investment and enhance infrastructure. 

4. 
Growth poles can be in the form o f regionally delimited poles o r targeted value 
chain poles. 
In order t o determine whether a reg iona l o r va lue cha in approach i s m o s t

Growth pole experiences in Africa 

5. 

A regional growth pole approach was adopted by the Malagasy Government in 
2003-2004 following a se r ies o f studies and analytical work initiated by the authorities and 
the World Bank. The ob jec t ive was t o enhance g r ow t h by reduc ing constraints t o investment, 
im p r o v i n g the inves tmen t climate, focus ing o n deve lop ing in f ras t ruc tu re and access t o f inance 
f o r business and strengthening the capacity o f human resources. The approach was imp lemen ted 
th rough a mu l t i sec to ra l p ro jec t in three regions o f the coun t ry w h i c h corresponded na tu ra l ly with 
po ten t ia l g r ow t h sectors: the N o s y - B E po le f o r tou r ism ; the F o r t D a u p h i n p o l e f o r mining and 
tou r ism (with an innova t ive PPP with R i o T in to ) and the An tanana r ivo -An ts i rabe f o r expo r t

6. 

A value chain growth poled was adopted in Cameroon. T h e coun t r y focused o n three 
sectors: forestry, t o u r i sm and I C T . 
In forestry, the Gove rnmen t has decided t o p romo te

In tourism,

(SNAT) presents a 
comprehensive diagnostic o f the country’s social and economic challenges. The S N A T 
p rov ides recommendations f o r economic g r ow t h and d ive r s i f ica t ion w h i c h inc lude : (i) the

The World Bank has supported reforms to the investment climate and helped carry 
out analysis to identify sectors and value chains that have a strong potential to accelerate 
growth and diversify in Burkina.” The series o f analyses have converged in indentifying the

o f g row th potential wh ich demonstrate favorable characteristics fo r m ine ra l exp lo i ta t ion o r high- 
value (selected value chain) agricultural p roduc t ion and processing. I t i s noted that this approach 
requ i res a strong commitment at the highest l e v e l and strengthened inter-ministerial coordination 
to ensu re effective ro l l -ou t o f g row th po le investments and reforms. The M i n i s t r i e s o f 
Ag r icu l tu re and Livestock, as well as the ministries responsible for trade, the p romo t ion and 
organization o f exports w i l l need to be pa r t icu la r ly implicated. The g row th po le approach w i l l 
p rov ide an ideal opportunity fo r the country to implement the Na t iona l Strategy o n Expo r t 
P romo t ion and the national po l icy o n qua l i ty standards. 

13. 
Agro-industry, identified as one o f the drivers o f growth and diversification, 
requires specific spatial planning of zones around the areas o f production. A land re fo rm 

law, in the process o f being adopted, establishes the regulatory framework fo r land use and 
agricultural p roduc t ion in ru ra l areas. I t confers secure land rights to f a rm e r s and promotes the 
expansion o f developed perimeters o f modern farming. The creation o f medium-sized industrial 
plants requ ires the development o f a coherent strategy to ensure adequate land allocation, 
investments in economic infrastructure (water, energy, transport) and pub l ic utility services. T o 
ensu re the market competitiveness o f agro-industries, professional t ra in ing and capacity 
development, support fo r the qua l i ty standardization and adherence t o international norms, 
coupled with imp roved access to finance are critical. 

14. 

The potential o f mineral exploitation remains limited due to the lack o f rail , 

infrastructure w h i c h wou ld facilitate the transport o f heavy minerals (manganese, phosphates). 
A public-private partnership to develop infrastructure cou ld encourage exp lo i ta t ion and 
developing the full potential o f the mines cou ld be envisaged as part o f the g row th po le 
approach. 

15. 

The tourism and handicraft sectors also have potential f o r growth although tourism, 

in particular, requ ires concerted efforts to (i) disenclave regions through better road connections; 
(ii) develop pub l ic private partnerships at an international l e v e l and; (iii) develop policies to 
imp rove the capacity and professionalism o f actors in the industry. 

16. 

The challenge f o r the Government w i l l be to strengthen the competitiveness o f 

identified high value supply chains at a national l e v e l (a process wh ich i s underway already) and 
to develop regional g row th poles b y encouraging the emergence and clustering. o f modern 
en te rp r ises through the p rov is ion o f qua l i f ied and skilled personnel and necessary infrastructure 
and services. The CAS seeks t o fiuther the dialogue with the Authorities o n the development o f 
regional g row th poles and p rov ide financing to target investments in identified agricultural 
g row th poles in order to catalyze investments and growth. 

Examples o f potential growth poles in Burkina Faso 

17. 

A more thorough analysis and extensive consultations a re necessary to properly 

identify growth poles in Burkina. Given that the f i r s t objective o f this note i s to contribute to 
the discussion o n the t y p e o f g row th pole approach to adopt in Burkina, i t w o u l d be premature t o 
propose with f ina l i ty any specific regions o r zones. However, certain regions naturally f o rm the 

113 

source o f supply chains w i t h value adding potential and a few examples o f potential g row th 
poles are presented be low to further the d i s c ~ s s i o n ~ ~ . 

18. 

Example o f potential agriculture growth pole in the Haut-Bassins region: The Haut 
Bassins region i s comprised o f th ree provinces, Houet, Tuy and Kenedougou. The largest c i ty in 
these provinces i s Bobo-Dioulasso wh ich accounts for over h a l f o f the population o f the region. 
The potential o f the region i s manifested in: 

0 The supply o f h i g h value agro-pastoral products: cotton, cereals, livestock, sesame, 
cashew, f r u i t s and vegetables (with a particular abundance o f fruit in Kenedougou - 
24000 tonnes per year) 
0 Ex is t ing economic infrastructure: an industrial zone i s already in place in Bobo and 
plans are underway fo r the installation o f an additional 2 zones: the airport could 
provide transport opportunities; a multimodal p la t fo rm fo r transport recently 
constructed i s directly linked w i t h the ra i lway w h i c h connects t o the nea res t po r t c i ty 
o f Abidjan; the re-opening o f roads and r a i l networks w i t h the I v o r y Coast w i l l 
enhance market access fo r the region wh ich su f fe red badly during the I vo r ian crisis; a 
central electricity interconnection with I v o r y Coast w i l l enable reduced factors costs. 
A core o f en te rp r ises in the region w i t h strong concentration in Bobo: the figures on 
entrepreneurial activity f r om the Chamber o f Commerce state that 4120 en te rp r ises 
exist in the region, o f wh i ch 65 percent are in commerce, 26,2 percent are in se rv ices 
and 8 percent are in industry. There are numerous small and medium manufacturing 
and processing plants ( o i l processing, dairy, fruit juice, dried h i t and vegetables) as 
we l l as large enterprises such as C ITEC (cotton oil, soap cottonseed meal), SOF ITEX 
(cotton), BRAKINA (drinks and mineral water), F I L S A H (cotton thread) and 
DAFANI (fruit concentrates and ju ices ) . Other industries in metallurgy, mechanics, 
chemicals and auxiliary products a re also found in the region and have developed 
exportation l i n k s with the sub-region, W A E M U countries and Europe and the 
Maghreb (cotton). 
A promising experience in agrobusiness i s the DAFANI factory wh ich started in 2006 
w i t h a production capacity o f 12000 tonnes. The factory has r e l i e d upon a similar 
s t ruc tu re t o SOFITEX, using a partnership with loca l producers to ensure p r ima ry 
product supply. 
Support structures (Chamber o f Commerce, MEBF branch, CEFORE, CEFAC) and a 
laboratory fo r quality control wh ich could be used to l i f t the quality o f export 
products to conform with international norms and build the capacity o f exportation 
companies.

Example o f a potential agriculture pole in the Cascades region: The Cascades region

Ex is t ing WE3 fmanced operations have targeted support to a few value chains: PAFASP adopted a combination 
value chain approach by targeting four production basins for onion production (Ouahigouya, Koudougou, Sourou, 
Tenkodogo). However, the project lacks su f f ic ien t linkages w i t h market access, ago-processing and quality 
assurance. This underlines t h e need for the development integrated service zones 

114 

Supply of agricultural products: cashew, mangoes and bananas a re the f r u i t s most 
produced in the region. The reg ion i s the second largest producer o f horticulture after 
Hau t Bassins and the largest producer o f cashew in Burkina. Cashews are exported 
o n a large scale to Ind ia and Europe. Sugar cane exists as a potential export product, 
even though the industrial processing unit has encountered financial d i f f icu l t ies in 
recent years. 
In this region, the accent cou ld be put o n the processing o f fruit, 
vegetables and cereals (processing o f cereals, dried h i t , cashew hu l l ing ) 
Economic infrastructure: the r a i l l i n k i n g B u r k i n a with I v o r y Coast traverses t h i s 
reg ion and i s in a good state; a special industrial zone cou ld be created to attract the 
emergence o f private processing investment 
The existence o f a number o f agro-industrial en terpr ises : even though there i s no 
formal industrial zone, the region accounts fo r some o f the largest food processing 
u n i t s like SOSUCO (sugar), SOPAL (alcohol and molasses) SOF ITEX (cotton), S N - 
GMB (imported wheat f lou r conditioning). Some o f these en t i t ies are o n the verge o f 
bankruptcy but the emergence o f other enterprises o f medium size capable o f 
developing economies o f scale could produce a positive effect. The existence o f a 
number o f associations and cooperatives specialized in exportation i s equally an asset 
w h i c h cou ld be used to link production and manufacturing with larger installations fo r 
export. 
Adm in is t ra t ive support structures cou ld be reinforced to enable entrepreneurs to 
obtain administrative documents and make arrangements at a loca l leve l .

Example o f a potential tourism growth pole: A Bank evaluation o f the different tourist 
s i t e s conducted in 2008 identified p r io r i t y areas with probable f u t u r e tourist potential and those 
secondary s i tes with limited potential. The evaluation also examined the possibilities fo r 
creating sustainable revenue in each area. The evaluation established a l i s t o f s i t e s by order o f 
p r io r i ty , namely (i) Arly (ii) Nazinga (iii) Hippopotamus Lagoon and Banfora (iv) Sahe l (in 
particular Oursi with i t s l i n k s to t h e Dogon reg ion o f Ma l i ) . T o develop these areas as regional 
tourism g row th poles, however, i t wou ld be necessary to develop the sites, create a PPP at an 
international l e v e l with a strategy o f disenclaving the access to the s i t e and strengthen the 
professional capacity within the sector. 

21. 
Example o f a mining growth pole in Tambao. The development o f the mine in 
Tambao fo r the exploitation o f manganese requ i res a heavy investment in r a i l infrastructure 
wh ich wou ld have positive externalities fo r access to market b y other export products (livestock, 
agricultural products etc). Acco rd ing to the mining study in the CEM , the Tambao mine 
contains 19 m i l l i o n tonnes o f manganese rese rves with an average content o f 50 to 54 percent 
M n 0 2 . The feas ib i l i ty study indicates an investment o f US$844 m i l l i o n i s required with 
investments in the order o f US$350 m i l l i o n fo r the construction o f the r a i l l i n e f i o m K a y a t o 
Tambao. This l i n e o f 250 km wou ld open the no r th o f the country and wou ld link through 
Ouagadougou, the D o r i Niamey l i n e wh ich i s envisaged in the development plans. A PPP fo r the 
construction o f the mine and the ra i lway cou ld be explored because o f the positive externalities 
fo r export o f other products, the disenclavement opportunity, and the poss ib i l i ty fo r 
transportation o f 500 000 to 1000000 tonnes per year over 20 years. The bene f i ts o f this mine 
and infrastructure need t o be verified with specialists and more detailed studies.

Appendix G: The CAS Approach to Demography 

I. Challenge o f Rapid Population Growth 

1. 
Burkina Faso has not yet started the last stage o f its demographic transition, i.e. the 
decline o f fertility. The current rate o f population g row th i s estimated at 3.1 percent per year, 
translating in to a doubling time o f the population in l e s s than 23 years. U n l e s s fe r t i l i ty declines 
rapidly, popu la t ion g row th w i l l accelerate due to imp rov ing mo r ta l i ty conditions and reduced 
emigration flows. Today, almost h a l f o f the Burkinabe population i s le ss than 15 years old. The 
potential fo r population growth, wh ich i s built in to the young age structure (a phenomenon 
known as the population momentum), w i l l further exacerbate the rap id popu la t ion g row th and 
contribute to the youthfulness o f the age structure. 

2. 
Rapid population growth w i l l require that greater levels o f public spending be 
mobilized for the formation o f human capital and the delivery o f basic serv ices , in 
particular in education and health. This situation w i l l be aggravated by the youthfulness o f 
the population as this translates in to larger demand fo r services. In addition, the small fo rma l 
employment sector w i l l face huge pressure f i o m a fast g row ing wo rk ing age population and j o b 
creation w i l l become a c r i t i ca l issue. Finally, the rap id ly rising Burkinabe popu la t ion w i l l 
increase the demand o n the agricultural sector, whose p roduc t iv i ty i s already weak, and w i l l 
hasten land saturation and environmental degradation. 

11. 

Government Response 

3 . 
Over the past decades, the lack o f strong political action contributed to a failure 
to significantly lower fertility rates and slow down population growth. The demographic 
crisis that has resu l ted n o w demands concerted po l i t ica l commitment and engagement. First, the 
consequences o f rap id popu la t ion g row th fo r development and human capital investments need 
to be fully understood and acted upon b y the Burkinabe leadership as well as their development 
partners. This w i l l requ i re enhanced advocacy in the area o f popu la t ion and reproductive health 
as well as the strengthening o f the current institutional framework t o address population issues . 
Second, development strategies inc lud ing poverty reduction programs need a l l t o factor in the 
importance o f demographic change, inc lud ing the use o f consistent data and more realistic 
assumptions. 
Importantly, 
the Government has recently demonstrated clear po l i t i ca l 
commitment to addressing demography as a c r i t ica l development constraint. A new 
development strategy forecast fo r 201 0-201 1 envisages p lac ing heavy emphasis o n demography 
as an ‘emerging development issue ’ . 

4. 

The implementation o f the new National Population Policy (NPP), revised in 
2000, has been disappointing. The efforts in the area o f popu la t ion and reproductive health 
requ i re consistent and l o n g programmatic efforts that are supported with a strong M o n i t o r i n g & 
Evaluation (M&E) framework. Instead, the NPP presen ts a broad spectrum o f interventions that 
are no t time-bound and do lack precise quantitative targets. Furthermore, programmatic 
documents, such as the health strategies, do no t address d i rec t ly the i ssue o f the contraceptive 
prevalence rates. Even specific documents, such as the contraceptive security strategy, rema in 
too vague and do no t use quantitative planning tools. 

117 

5 . 

Interventions in the area o f population and reproductive health urgently require 
scaling up. The demographic evolution generally assumed in Bu rk ina Faso’s development 
strategies w i l l no t happen automatically, but can on ly be achieved w i t h more proactive policies. 
Moreover, the coordination between strategies fo r different sectors needs to be strengthened b y 
mainstreaming a coherent use o f population data and consistent population po l icy interventions. 
I t i s suggested to focus the e f fo r t on a few key interventions that can possibly and rap id ly b r ing 
demographic change. These include: strategic u s e o f realistic demographic data fo r programs’ 
design; effective information, education, and communication campaigns aimed at behavior 
change; universal education especially fo r girls; access to quality family planning services; and 
better employment and economic opportunities o f women. 

111. 

The Country Assistance Strategy Approach and Demographic Change Filter 

6. 

I n most Bank strategic documents in Burkina Faso (e.g. Country Economic 
Memorandum, CAS), population growth i s identified as being amongst the most important 
development constraints (this i s also the case in the SNAT o r E tude Sche‘ma d’ame‘nugement d u 
te r r i to i re funded by the A f r i can Development Bank). The CAS draws upon the new po l i t ica l 
enabling environment t o target demography as a cross-cutting issue which affects Burkina’s 
major development changes o f growth and social service delivery. A holistic approach i s 
adopted wh ich incorporates: (i) po l icy dialogue and technical assistance; (ii) targeted operations; 
and (iii) po r t fo l io mainstreaming. 

7. 

The Bank seeks to draw upon its comparative advantage in policy dialogue to 
promote greater government and stakeholder engagement in demography and to establish 
clear linkages between population growth, macro-economic stability and poverty reduction. 

8. 

Analytical support and technical assistance will help to guide government 
policies, communication strategies and activities. 
In order to assist the Government in 
developing well-targeted and effective population interventions, IDA w i l l support a more 
detailed analysis o f the underlying determinants o f h i g h fe r t i l i t y and limited u se o f fam i ly 
planning. Through technical assistance, IDA w i l l wo rk with other partners such as UNFPA , to 
support the Government in updating i t s population policies and developing and implementing 
effective information, education, and communication (IED) and behavior change communication 
(BCC) campaigns. 

9 . 
IDA financed operations w i l l also target demographic issues. Several existing 
IDA projects in education, health, and community driven development, support the deceleration 
o f rap id population growth. These operations include components to improve: female literacy 
and education; women’s access to, and involvement in economic activities and governance. The 
Health Support Services and HIV/AIDS program specifically supports access to reproductive 
and sexual health services, including family planning. The Transport Sector Development 
Project also incorporates a component on HIV/AIDS education, wh ich includes imp rov ing 
access to condoms. The design o f these operations r e l i e s already on realistic demographic data. 
A new reproductive health operation in FY 10 w i l l strengthen government initiatives to improve 
access to fam i ly planning and increase modern contraceptive usage. The C E M highlights the 
immediate significance o f imp rov ing access in order to mee t the h i g h leve l o f m e t
contraceptive needs in Bu rk ina Faso (currently at 29 percent). As the Bank i s a new player in 
addressing population g row th and reproductive health in Bu rk ina Faso, partnerships with other 

118 

 
agencies that have greater comparative advantage w i l l be explored t o assist in effective 
implementation. 

10. 

I n order to highlight the importance o f demography as a development issue and 
support the widespread dissemination o f information and education, the World Bank will 
pilot the application o f an innovative demographic change filter throughout the portfolio. 

The f i l t e r w i l l draw upon expe r t ise within the Bank and w i l l be designed in collaboration with 
the Government and relevant stakeholders. I t w i l l provide task teams with a check l i s t o f options 
to integrate demographic issues in the design o f new projects and AAA work, as we l l as in the 
re t ro f i t t ing o f existing projects (if feasible). The f i l t e r w i l l encourage: 

(a) The use of adequate and sound demographic data in the design ofproject a n d o r AAA 
activities. This w i l l also entail the use o f such data in a strategic manner. Fo r 
example, urban projects should target their interventions according t o the bes t 
available demographic data on urbanization in order to p r io r i t ize the need ies t 
populations. This may ca l l fo r the gathering o f the bes t available data and analyses to 
be included in the project design; 

(b) The incorporation of a consistent communications stratem on demographic issues. 
The f i l t e r w i l l include a communications strategy, aligned with the relevant new 
government strategies, t o guide task teams in mainstreaming a consistent and clear 
message o n demography in a l l lending and non-lending operations. 

(c) Where relevant, the inclusion of speciJic popu la t ion and family p lann ing IEUBCC 
components in order t o reach p ro jec t personnel and/or constituencies (this i s 
especially important f o r projects that invo lve communities and/or commun i ty 
leaders). This approach w i l l m i r ro r the approach adopted by existing projects to 
address H I V / A ID S . 
In fo rma t ion and education about fam i ly p lann ing choices and 
options w i l l empower women and couples to take conscious decisions o n 
childbearing and enable behavior change. 

(d) Where relevant, an assessment of 
the impact of 
the p ro jec t development objectives 
(PDOs) on demographic and reproductive health outcomes. F o r example, an urban 
project cou ld estimate the impact o f urban improvements o n demographic outcomes 
such as imp roved use o f contraception among urban populations.

Appendix I: Lessons from the Client Survey 2008 

Globally, respondents o f t h e client survey identified government effectiveness/ governance and 
access to education as the top development priorities fo r Bu rk ina Faso, fo l lowed by poverty 
reduction and growth. W h e n considering poverty and growth, the survey findings indicate the 
overwhelming v iew that agricultural p roduc t iv i ty i s a c r i t ica l e lemen t t o bo th poverty reduction 
and generating faster growth in Burkina. At the same time, the survey findings indicate a c lea r 
understanding o f the link between poverty and growth, and private sector development, 
governance, and access to education. 

An interesting dissonance emerges between where stakeholders think the Bank focuses i t s 
attention and resources, and where they think the Bank should focus i t s attention. A p lu ra l i ty o f 
respondents reported that the W o r l d Bank considered g row th i t s p r ima ry p r io r i ty ( fo l lowed by 
governance and environmental quality). However, nearly a third said that t h e Bank should focus 
primarily o n agriculture productivity, fo l lowed by education, growth, environmental quality and 
infrastructure.

In summary, respondents wou ld l i k e to see the Bank significantly invo lved in key p r io r i ty areas - 
agriculture, education and g row th in particular - l e s s so governance wh ich they consider the top 
development p r io r i ty in the country. The survey findings also suggest opportunity fo r greater 
emphasis on private sector development (potentially more coordination with IFC perhaps) and 
focus o f research and knowledge. 

The Bank received h i g h ratings in a number o f areas related to i t s behaviors, relationships and 
work. Stakeholders consider the Bank very responsive and forthcoming with information. In

I N T E R N A T I O N A L M O N E T A R Y FUND AND

BURKINA FASO 

Joint BanMund Debt Sustainability Analysis 

Prepared by the staffs o f the International Development Association 
and t h e International Monetary Fund 

Approved by Carlos A. P r imo Braga and Sudhir Shetty (IDA) 
and M ichae l Atingi-Ego and Anthony Boote (IMF) 

M a y 20,2009 

The debt sustainability outlook for Bu rk ina Faso is aligned with the results of the previous 
debt sustainability analysis @SA) update carried out in November 2008. 52 Despite a clear 

increase i n p ro jec ted g o l d exports i n 2010, the medium- and long-term export outlook 
deteriorates s l igh t ly because exports of cotton a re reduced. Bu rk ina Faso is s t i l l c l a s s i j e d 
as a medium performer 53 and the country remains at high r isk of debt distress. 

V I I . BACKGROUND 

1. 

The analysis presented in this document i s based on the stock o f Burkina Faso’s 
debt at end-2007. The stock o f debt was established fo l low ing a creditor-by-creditor and 
loan-by-loan reconciliation exercise that was ca r r ied out in April 2008 and showed a 
negligible discrepancy between the authorities’ and creditors’ data. Moreover, the stock o f 
debt at end-2008 has been estimated based on aggregated in fo rma t ion provided by the 
authorities. 

2. 
Burkina Faso’s external debt i s composed in the largest part by financing from 
multilateral creditors, which account for almost 80 percent o f the total o f outstanding 
loans. The share o f the Wo r ld Bank represen ts about one third o f the total, that o f the AfDB 
about 15 percent, and that o f the IMF about 3 percent. Loans f rom bilateral creditors 
represent about 20 percent o f the total, o f wh ich about 90 percent were extended b y non-Paris 
Club creditors. Bu rk ina Faso’s loans have long maturities, w i t h an overall grant e lemen t 
wh ich currently stands at about 48 percent and i s projected to remain above 3 5 percent fo r 

5 2 For the jo in t DSA f iom Ap r i l 2008, see EBS/08/136 and Annex 6 in IDA Report No. 4033-BF, August 26, 
2008; for the DSA update fiom November 2008 prepared by Fund staff, see EBS/08/136. The comparison to 
changes since the last DSA r e f e r s to the November 2008 update, un le ss otherwise indicated. 
” With a three-year backward moving average CPIA for 2005-2007 below 3.75. 

138 

the en t i re projection pe r iod o f the DSA. W h i l e there i s a gradual dec l ine in the grant e lemen t 
t o about 37 percent by 2028, this i s explained fo r the most part by a s h i f t in emphasis in new 
lending f r om multilateral to bilateral creditors. W i t h regard to the composition o f external 
financing, the grant-financing share amounted to 56 percent in 2008. 

3 . 

Since the transition from a centralized to a market-oriented economy in the 
early 199Os, Burkina Faso's Government has consistently demonstrated its commitment 
to stay current on its external payment obligations. This includes the period before the 
country benefited f rom debt r e l i e f under the Heav i ly Indebted Poor Country In i t ia t ive 
(HIPC), when the N P V o f debt-to-exports ratio was well above 200 percent. The 3 5 percent 
concessionality f loo r i s strictly enforced fo r a l l central-government foreign-currency 
borrowings, and projects are consistently scrutinized by a Na t iona l Public Debt Committee 
before negotiations a re concluded. 

V I I I . UNDELRYING MACROECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS 

4. 
The medium-term outlook fo r growth i s generally unchanged from the previous 
DSA. Projections fo r real GDP g row th h o l d over the medium-term, but have been lowered 
by 1.4 percentage points fo r 2009 and 1.9 percentage points fo r 2010 because o f the 
slowdown in global demand, notably in the cotton sector. As a resu l t , nom ina l GDP 
projections are slightly lower than in the previous DSA, but the upward trend i s clear fo r the 
medium and long t e r m (Figure 1, Panel 1). Real GDP growth i s projected to average 
6 percent in the long run, in l i n e with the average fo r the past t e n years. In f la t ion i s projected 
to decline to 4.8 percent in 2009,2.3 percent in 2010, and to the historical average o f about 2 
percent in 20 1 1.

Recent commodity price developments warranted a revision o f some projections 
o n the external sector compared to the previous DSA. In the near term , the projected

decline in co t ton p r ices w i l l be o f fse t by an increase in the p r i c e o f g o l d and a dec l ine in o i l 
prices, lead ing t o an imp rovemen t in the terms o f trade o f about 10 percent and a n a r r ow i n g 
o f the current account de f ic i t . The m e d i um te rm expo r t o u t l o o k has been rev ised f o r the 
f o l l ow i n g reasons: 

e 

a 

e 

Commodity prices: C o t t o n p r ices have dec l ined by about 4 0 percent since the i r 
Augus t 2008 peak; they a re about 2 1 percent l ow e r f o r 2009 and 14 percent l ow e r f o r 
2010 than the p rev ious D S A p ro jec ted (Figure 1, Pane l 5 ) . O n the other hand, g o l d 
p r ices are expected t o be about 2 9 percent higher in 2009 and 2 7 percent higher in 
2010. 
Exchange rate: The va lue o f the US do l la r re la t ive t o the CFA franc has been rev ised 
upward by 5.7 percent, w h i c h over the m e d i um t e rm reduces the t o t a l va lue in U.S. 
do l la rs o f B u r k i n a Faso’s exports. 
Medium-term export potential: The f i rs t s ign i f ican t change i s a d ow nw a r d r e v i s i o n 
in the va lue o f c o t t o n exports based o n l ow e r expo r t p r ices and the negative impac t o n 
supply o f the increase in co t ton inventories g loba l ly . D u e t o the shortage o f arable 
lands, the share o f co t ton exports as a percent o f GDP i s p ro jec ted t o decline 
markedly over the l o n g t e rm (Figure 1, Panel 2). The second impo r tan t change comes 
f r o m a dramatic increase in the vo lume o f g o l d exports in 2010, f r o m 10.5 tons in the 
p rev ious D S A t o 16 tons currently, because o f the operations ove r the n e x t ten years 
o f a n ew g o l d m ine . W h i l e exp lo ra t ion i s unde rway f o r add i t iona l mines, w h i c h 
c o u l d lead t o s ign i f ican t l y h ighe r g o l d exports, th is i s n o t re f lec ted in the assumptions 
o f the current DSA. A third change concerns the increase f r o m 2015 onwa rd in the 
exports o f f r u i t s , vegetables and cereals as the authorities’ ag r icu l tu ra l d ive rs i f ica t ion 
strategy comes i n t o p lay . 

7. 
The current account deficit i s expected to narrow moderately in the medium and 
long run as the tighter fiscal stance dampens import demand. E x p o r t g r ow t h i s d r i v e n in 
the m e d i um te rm by the p ro jec ted increase in g o l d exports in 2010 and in the l o n g t e rm by

Revenue is lower in the near term, but will gradually recover to reach 17 percent of GDP , contributing 
to a reduction in the fiscal deficit over the medium term. While lower than expected in 2008, external 
borrowing requirements for the medium term remain in line with those of the previous DSA .

T h e r e a r e no s ign if icant changes to the ind ica to rs compa red to the prev ious D S A 
(F igu re 2). Unde r the baseline scenario, there i s a slight de te r io ra t ion in the N P V o f debt-to- 
exports ratio, the o n l y ind ica to r that breaches the ind ica t ive thresholds. With the dec l ine in

190.7 percent in the p rev ious DSA. Nevertheless, a l l other debt ind ica to rs r em a i n

How vulnerable i s the debt sustainability outlook to further backlash from the 
current global cr is is? The baseline scenario o f t h e DSA assumes (i) a continued 
improvement in revenue performance to mee t the WAEMU target o f 17 percent in 201 5 and 
(ii) a moderate dec l ine in the share o f cotton in total exports that i s compensated in the 
medium t e rm b y a significant increase in the volume and value o f go ld exports. 

12. 
The alternative scenario assumes a further decline in projected revenue 
compared to precrisis levels, a worsening o f the outlook f o r cotton, and lower gold 
prices as the global recovery starts to take hold: 
Revenues are lower by 0.5 percentage points o f GDP in bo th 2010 and 201 1 , 
before gradually recovering to their baseline leve l by 20 17. 

Cotton prices a re 10 percent lower in 20 10, returning t o the baseline in 201 1. 

Cotton export volumes are 20 percent lower in 2010, an impact that carries 
over in to the medium and long run as producers d ive rs i fy away f rom the 
sector in response to lower prices in 2009 and 2010 and declining prospects. 

Go ld prices are 10 percent lower in 201 1 and 5 pe rcen t lowe r in 2012 and 
20 13 before catching up to the baseline leve l in 20 14 (Figure 3). 

13. 
The results under the alternative scenario do not foresee a significant 
deterioration o f the debt sustainability outlook, and most debt sustainability indicators 
would be little affected over the long term. The indicators remain be low their indicative 
thresholds fo r medium performers, w i t h the exception o f the N P V o f debt-to-exports ratio, 
which exceeds 200 percent (Figure 4).

Figure 3. Alternative Scenario with Lower Revenues and Exports: Assumptions 

Revenue is lower by 0.5 percent of GDP in 2010 and 201 1 but gradually recovers to reach the 
WAEMU target of 17 percent of GDP in 2017.

XI. PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS 

14. 
The results f o r the fiscal DSA are similar to those f o r the external DSA. 
Domes t ic debt i s low-gross domestic debt i s estimated at app rox ima te ly 2.7 percent o f GDP 
at end-2008, and ne t debt at 1.3 percent o f GDP. Mo reove r , i t i s assumed t o decline fu r the r 
ove r the p ro jec t ion p e r i o d as the authorities seek t o a v o i d mo re cos t ly domestic f inanc ing o f 
the f isca l de f ic i t . As a result, p u b l i c debt dynamics are la rge ly de te rm ined by the e v o l u t i o n 
o f external debt. 

15. 
Public debt indicators could worsen under some scenarios. 
The standard 
sens i t iv i ty tests revea l the p u b l i c debt ou t look t o be vu lne rab le t o persistent large primary 
de f ic i ts and an unexpected increase in debt creating f lows , unde r w h i c h the debt ra t ios w o u l d 
increase sharply ove r the p r o j e c t i o n pe r iod . These results highlight the impo r tance t o f o l l o w 
p ruden t f isca l and b o r r ow i n g po l ic ies . Fa i lu re t o reduce the cu r ren t de f ic i t s w o u l d lead t o 
ever-increasing debt indicators; howeve r the authorities a re c omm i t t e d t o ongo ing tax 
re fo rms designed t o l ow e r the d e f i c i t t o m o r e sustainable levels. 

X. 

CONCLUSION 

16. 
Burkina Faso’s risk o f debt distress i s high because o f the NPV o f debt-to-exports 
ratio; a l l other debt ind ica to rs r em a i n com fo r tab ly b e l ow the i r po l icy -dependen t thresholds in 
the baseline scenario. Nevertheless, the high risk o f distress underscores the impo r tance o f 
limiting external b o r r ow i n g t o concessional loans, ma in ta in ing a p ruden t f isca l p o l i c y t o limit 
the accumu la t ion o f n e w debt, i n c l u d i n g by sustaining the ongo ing t a x reforms, and making 
con t inued e f fo r ts t o d i v e r s i f y and increase exports. Mo reove r , the authorities shou ld 
con t inue t o im p r o v e their p o l i c y and ins t i tu t iona l environment, w h i c h ove r t im e m a y resu l t in

Annex 12: CAS Consultations 

The country team has engaged in extensive consultations during the preparation o f the 
CAS. Consultations invo lved a four-stage process. 
1. In October, a 2 day CAS retreat in vo lv ing Government, development partners, 
c i v i l society, media and private sector took place. Participants reviewed 
performance under the 2006 CAS and agreed upon orientations fo r the new 
strategy. 
2 . Between October and June, a core CAS t e a m consisting o f government 
representatives and Bank staff has convened regularly to develop the strategy. 
3. In March 2009 , extensive consultations in Ouagadougou and 8 provinces 
(Yatenga Sourou SCno Soum Houet KCnCdougou S i s s i l i and Nahouri). 
Approximately 2000 participants 
f r om Government, c i v i l society, 
ru ra l 
communities, local municipalities, universities, media, parliament and the private 
sector were consulted o n the strategy’s diagnosis o f development challenges and 
the approach and areas o f concentration adopted. 
4. O n 22 M a y 2009 , consultations were conducted with government M i n i s t e r s . 

The approach o f the strategy was well-received during the March and M a y 2009 
consultations. Participants agreed that a spatial approach to diversification and g row th 
w i l l enhance impact, but s tressed the importance o f selecting regions objectively and o n 
the basis o f thoroughly researched projections. Participants were also strongly in favor o f 
support to decentralized social service delivery, c i t ing capacity development fo r 
communes and direct funding to loca l communes as priorities. 

Opinions differed as to the instruments envisaged by the draft strategy. C i v i l society, 
loca l communities and parts o f the private sector expressed concern that budget support 
did no t reach intended bene f ic ia r ies or the private sector. W h i l e development partners 
and government counterparts highlighted the importance o f scaling up budget support in 
the context o f the global financial crisis. Overall, the consultations h igh l igh ted the 
importance o f ensuring an appropriate balance between general budget support and 
project lending, inc lud ing direct support to loca l communes. 

The most frequently cited areas fo r W B G intervention included: 

Agriculture and livestock: training o f farmers , irrigation, agro-processing, access 
to inputs and finance; access to loca l and regional markets; land tenure secur i ty ; 
diversification in to non-traditional products e.g. loca l native edible plants 
Infrastructure: energy and transport costs; ru ra l roads; explore alternative energy 
sources (solar, nuclear); r a i l 
Environmental degradation: natural resource management; disaster risk 
management; environmental damage caused by cotton production and mining. 
Cotton: debt r e l i e f fo r fa rme rs ; subsidized agricultural inputs; W o r l d Bank 
influence on global commodity price 
M in ing : environmental protection; support to SMEs

Secu r i ty was raised a concern in ru ra l areas. 

The consultations highlighted the need fo r the Bank to adopt a better communication 
strategy in Bu rk ina Faso. There i s generally limited knowledge about the Bank’s 
support. Former structural adjustment policies continue to dominate overall impressions 
o f Bank performance in Burkina. 

The consultations also revealed the need to improve in fo rma t ion dissemination on 
particular projects, avoid overly complex micro-project procedures and enhance 
monitoring and evaluation o f Bank projects in the field through c i v i l society and loca l 
community participation.

Burkina Faso-IMF Assessment Note f o r the World Bank 
This no te p rov ides an assessment o f recent mac roeconom ic developments in B u r k i n a 
Faso and progress unde r the Fund-supported three-year Pove r ty Reduc t ion and G r ow t h 
F a c i l i t y p rog ram (PRGF). T h i s assessment i s based o n the f ind ings o f the m i s s i o n for the 
f o u r t h r e v i ew tha t t o o k p lace in Ouagadougou M a r c h 1 8 - A p r i l 1 , 2009 . 

Recent Economic Developments and Program Performance 

In 2008 and ea r ly 2009 , B u r k i n a Faso's economy weathered the t r i p l e ex te rna l shocks 
(oil, food, and the g loba l f inanc ia l crisis) f a i r l y w e l l . Rea l GDP g r ow t h reached an 
estimated 5 percent in 2008 , supported by a rebound in ag r icu l tu ra l p r o d u c t i o n and the 
open ing o f 'three n e w g o l d m ines . With the decline in c omm o d i t y prices, i n f l a t i o n f e l l t o 
6.8 percent year-on-year in M a r c h 2009 after peak ing at 15.1 percent in June last year. 
Domes t ic f o o d prices, however, have dec l ined less than in te rna t iona l prices. The trade 
d e f i c i t w idened t o 1 1 .O percent o f GDP, f r o m 8 .8 percent in 2007 , because o f h ighe r o i l 
impo r ts and l ow e r co t ton exports. 

Desp i te d i f f i c u l t econom ic conditions, p rog ram pe r fo rmance was b road ly in l i n e with 
objectives. A l l quan t i ta t ive performance c r i te r ia we re met, i n c l u d i n g the targets f o r the 
f isca l de f ic i t , revenues, and social expenditure. Howeve r , fo re ign - f inanced cap i ta l 
expenditure was some 2% percent o f GD P l ow e r than programmed, m a i n l y due t o poo r 
p ro jec t planning and execu t ion and h ighe r costs tha t requ i red renego t ia t ion o f loans. 
Desp i te progress o n p repa ra t ion f o r tax p o l i c y re fo rm , some delays have occurred 
because o f la te de l ive ry o f techn ica l assistance, inadequate domestic capacity, and the 
cha l leng ing ex te rna l context. 

Outlook and Policy Challenges 

The g loba l f inanc ia l c r i s is in f luences the near-term o u t l o o k and i s cons t ra in ing g row th . 
M o n t h l y trade ind ica to rs and trade-related revenues are slackening. W h i l e l ow e r p r ices 
dampen the ou t look f o r co t ton exports, the impac t o n the balance o f paymen ts w i l l be 
cushioned by ag r icu l tu ra l in i t ia t ives , l ow e r o i l prices, and h ighe r g o l d prices. Rea l GDP 
g r ow t h i s p ro jec ted t o dec l ine t o 3 % percent in 2009. Changes in c omm o d i t y p r ices are 
expected t o im p r o v e the te rms o f trade and slightly n a r r ow the cu r ren t account de f ic i t . 

There are r isks t o the ou t look . Fu r the r decline in w o r l d co t ton p r ices c o u l d threaten the 
f inanc ia l s tab i l i ty o f the ginning companies, w h i c h w o u l d have nega t ive side-effects f o r 
the en t i re economy. A wo rsen ing g loba l c r is is c o u l d also fu r the r p u s h d o w n remittances, 
fo re ign d i rec t 
investment, and other 
f inanc ia l 
f lows , 
l ow e r i n g inves tmen t and

consumption. An unexpectedly fast global recovery wou ld support a turnaround in 
Bu rk ina Faso. 

In this d i f f icu l t environment, the key challenge i s sustain the re fo rm momentum, with a 
particular focus on fiscal reforms to raise revenues, and growth-enhancing reforms to 
make the cotton sector more e f f i c i e n t and the financial sector stronger. 

Wh i le there i s some scope for countercyclical fiscal policy, debt sustainability concerns 
ca l l fo r caution, and grant financing w i l l be especially important in the event that 
downside r i s k s to revenue materialize. Medium-term fiscal consolidation remains 
necessary to reduce the h i g h risk o f debt distress, and while the fiscal deficit on a 
commitment basis i s projected to widen t o 5 .1 percent o f GDP in 2009, i t should decline 
to 4.1 percent o f GDP b y 201 1. Preparatory wo rk fo r tax po l i cy re fo rm i s underway w i t h 
a v iew to revise the business tax, s t ream l ine tax exemptions, and strengthen VAT. 

In the cotton sector, though financing fo r the next campaign has been secured on 
conditions similar to last year’s, the capital base o f SOFITEX, the largest ginning 
company, i s eroding, and producer association internal arrears have r isen . Reforming the 
sector i s c r i t ica l i f the country’s medium-term g row th and development objectives are to 
be achieved. The authorities have stressed their commitment to increasing t h e 
transparency and efficiency o f SOFITEX. S ta f f encouraged the authorities to wo rk 
closely with the W o r l d Bank and t a k e the necessary steps t o increase productivity. 

The financial system has so far weathered the global financial storm, but could be 
vulnerable to a drying-up o f l iqu id i ty , an increase in nonperforming loans as the economy 
slows, credit concentration, or withdrawal o f foreign banks i f disruptions in international 
financial markets should 
in tens i fy . 
Be t te r surveillance, supervision, and risk 
management at bo th national and regional levels are thus essential. Staff encouraged the 
authorities t o ensure adequate fo l low up to the financial sector action plan that was 
submitted t o Cabinet in March 2009. 

Overall, we be l ieve 
that 
the PRGF-supported program w i l l provide a sound 
macroeconomic framework to guide the authorities’ re fo rm efforts. S ta f f w i l l continue to 
maintain close coordination w i t h donors. 

Relations with the IMF 

The Executive Board discussion o f the fourth rev iew under the PRGF arrangement i s 
scheduled o n June 22, and the mission fo r the 2009 A r t ic le I V consultation and fifth 
review under the PRGF arrangement i s expected to take place in September.

Annex 14: Donor Coordination in Burkina Faso 

S ince the adoption o f the Paris Declaration in Ma rch 2005, the Bank has been wo rk ing 
w i t h other development partners to align support with Bu rk ina Faso’s priorities and 
policies (as l a i d out in the PRSP) and coordinate donor activities to reduce transaction 
costs and achieve greater resu l ts . 

In 2007 the Na t iona l Ac t ion Plan for Aid Effectiveness was produced and a coordination 
body (la Coordination Nationale de 1’EfficacitC de 1’Aide’ ‘CONEA ’ ) was established to 
facilitate aid effectiveness and donor coordination in Bu rk ina Faso. A National 
Coordinator fo r Aid Effectiveness was also appointed to act as an interface between the 
Government and development partners. 

The Government has recently re-asserted i t s commitment to leading the a id coordination 
process, particularly in t h e context o f the upcoming Accelerated G row th and Sustainable 
Development Strategy. In April 2009, the Government released a new Concept No te on 
Imp rov ing A id Effectiveness wh i ch focuses on strengthened government leadership and 
enhanced mutual accountability. To lower transaction costs and facilitate coordinated 
development partner mon i to r ing o f the PRSP , the Government and development partners 
have agreed to the formation o f a ‘troika’ o f donors to lead discussions and represent the 
development partner community. The Government has also launched the preparation o f a 
study on technical assistance and the national po l icy on pub l ic a id in Bu rk ina Faso. To 
centralize and mon i to r systematically the various aid flows, the Government i s in the 
process o f establishing an Aid Management Platform based on web technology 
developed by the Development Gateway Foundation (DGF). This p la t fo rm w i l l 
strengthen alignment o f donor interventions behind national priorities, improve the 
predictability o f aid flows, support the coordination o f assistance by the Government and 
a l low better resu l ts mon i to r ing o f aid flows. 

A technical secretariat (STELA) was established in 2005 to support development partners 
in aligning behind the country’s Na t iona l Ac t ion Plan fo r Aid Effectiveness and in 
developing a Joint Ass is tance Strategy (JAS). Wh i le progress has been slow, the 
development partners have recently renewed their commitment to develop a JAS 
fo l low ing the introduction o f the next Poverty Reduction Strategy expected in 20 10- 1 1. 
A retreat w i l l be conducted in FY 10 to consolidate the approach o f development partners 
towards a id coordination in Bu rk ina and c la r i fy a country diagnostic in preparation fo r 
the development o f the PRSP. Development partners have also committed to imp rov ing 
information sharing through the Country Analytic W o r k website. 

Results f rom the 2008 Su rvey on Mon i to r ing Paris Declaration show that the Bank has 
made substantial progress toward the Paris Declaration targets but more efforts are 
needed to deepen these achievements. The Bank i s on track to meeting the Paris 
Declaration targets fo r use o f pub l ic financial management (PFM) systems and has made 
progress on increasing lending through Program-Based approaches (PBAs) as w e l l as 
conducting j o i n t analytic work. 

160 

Program-Based approaches (PBAs). Since 2000 the W o r l d Bank’s Country Assistance 
Strategies have supported CSLP I and I1 implementation. The CAS 2006-2009 resu l ts 
ma t r ix clarifies the link between W o r l d Bank-supported activities and PRSP objectives. 
Programmatic approaches have been adopted in the education, health and water sectors, 
although full fiduciary integration i s yet to be achieved due to inadequate country system 
implementation. 

Use of national f inanc ia l systems. Significant progress in strengthening public finance 
management has allowed increased use o f national P F M systems b y the development 
partners. The 2008 Survey o n mon i to r ing Paris Declaration indicates that 58percent o f 
Bank disbursements in 2007 used national P F M systems against 3Opercent fo r the 
A f r ican countries group that responded to the survey. The Bank undertook a PER j o i n t l y 
with the A f r i can Development Bank, UN IC E F and European U n i o n du r ing the CAS 
period. 

Reliance on parallel PIUS. The Government and external partners are mak ing some 
e f fo r t to progressively integrate PIUs in to country structures. The Bank i s increasingly 
re ly ing o n single P IUS to coordinate multiple projects fo r a sector, inc lud ing community 
driven development, transport, water and ru ra l development. The size o f P IUs i s being 
progressively scaled down. Their role and functions are sh i f t ing f r om project execution 
t o capacity bu i ld ing and coordination. The Bank has made real progress in integrating 
project management in to existing national structures. The 2008 Survey o n Mon i to r ing 
Paris Declaration shows that 1 OOpercent o f the Bank-financed projects were integrated 
in to national structures in 2008. 

Coordinated Technical Assistance. A progressive move toward budget support i s 
he lp ing the Government and external partners strengthen coordinated capacity support 
around country needs and priorities. 
In January 2005, the Government signed a 
Memorandum o f Understanding fo r j o i n t budgetary support, the Cadre gCnCral pour 
l ’appu i budgCtaire (CGAB), along with nine external partners: the AfDB, France, 
Denmark, the EC, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the W o r l d Bank. 
The CG A B provides fo r coordination o f a l l participating partners’ capacity bu i ld ing 
activities t o strengthen public financial management. External partners also committed to 
rely on national expertise to conduct analytical wo rk related to pub l ic financial 
management. The Government has recently introduced a new mon i to r ing structure t o 
combine budget support and PRSP monitoring. The W o r l d Bank w i l l lead donors as 
chair o f the CG A B process in FY 10. 

Joint analytic work. W h i l e analytical wo rk i s mos t ly carried out separately, some e f fo r t 
i s being made to conduct j o i n t analytical work. The 2005 Country Procurement 
Assessmen t Review was conducted j o i n t l y by the AfDB and the W o r l d Bank. AFD and 
the W o r l d Bank also supported two environmental impact assessments in the powe r 
sector and r e l i e d on them to launch parallel operations. In FY07, external partners also 
supported the Government in assessing the quality o f financial management through the 
PEFA framework and in FY 0 9 a j o i n t PER i s being carried out on decentralized basic 
service delivery.

the ava i lab i l i ty o f the IDA f inanc ing envelope; and (ii) 
the p r io r i t iza t ion ou t l ined in the revised PRSP and the 
new CAS. Full f inanc ing o f pro jec t costs i s expected 
to be applied selectively, p r ima r i ly fo r operations 
supporting reg iona l HIV/AIDS programs and re fo rm 
efforts. Cost sharing w i l l l i k e l y be the r u l e in projects 
with con tr ibu t ions f r om other sources than 
Government, co- f inanc ing by other donors, and 
projects with revenue generating and SWAP 
mechanisms. 
Given the country’s frag i le f inanc ia l situation, the 
Bank w i l l continue t o mon i to r the aggregate f isca l and 
debt situation, and i t s imp l ica t ions fo r recurrent cost 
financing. In a l l cases, recurrent cost f inanc ing w i l l

and (ii) imp l ied fu ture budget outlays. 

The cr i ter ia f o r Bank f inanc ing o f loca l costs are met. 
Therefore, the Bank may finance loca l costs in any
