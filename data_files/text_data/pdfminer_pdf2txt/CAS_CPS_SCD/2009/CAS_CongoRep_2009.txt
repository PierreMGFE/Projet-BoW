EXECUT IVE SUMMARY 

1. 

Since the ceasefire in 2000 and adoption o f a new Constitution in 2002, the Republic o f 
Congo has been largely at peace. Although the po l i t ica l environment remains fragile, the country has 
made substantial progress in rebuilding the state and consolidating peace. Congo i s now in the midst 
o f its second election cycle since the end o f war, w i th legislative elections held in mid-2007, and the 
next presidential election scheduled for July 2009. W i th full restoration o f peace, Congo has the 
potential for building a strong and robust economy and attaining a h igh standard o f l iv ing for i t s 
people: it has a relatively small population o f 3.8 m i l l ion , a significant endowment o f oil, natural 
forests, arable land, a biodiversity o f global importance, minerals, and a strategic location in Central 
A f r ica w i th a deep-sea port at Pointe-Noire that can serve as a gateway to the sub-region. 

ii. 
Since the return to peace, most social indicators have improved, but they are still below 
those o f countries with comparable per capita income. The incidence o f monetary poverty, which 
had risen from 40 percent in 1990 to 70 percent in 1997, had fallen back to 50 percent by 2005. 
Meeting the M i l lenn ium Development Goals remains a challenge, particularly in the health sector. 

iii. 
Congo has made significant progress on macroeconomic stabilization and “first 
generation” structural reforms since the end o f the civil strife. GDP at constant prices nearly 
doubled from 2002 to 2008, while in f la t ion has remained broadly under control. However, economic 
performance has been strongly affected by swings in o i l prices and production levels, particularly in 
the past two years. Fiscal performance strengthened markedly during 2008, enabling the start o f a new 
three-year PRGF program supported by the I M F in December 2008. 

iv. The global financial cr is is poses a serious threat to economic stability and growth in Congo, 
but i t i s also an opportunity, as it gives more urgency to implementing the reform agenda. The 
e f f e c t s o f the c r i s i s have mainly been transmitted through the sharp decline in o i l prices and demand 
for wood exports s ince mid-2008. This has strongly affected the economy and the fiscal situation. The 
large f i s c a l and foreign exchange cushion bu i l t up during the recent o i l price boom and the projected 
strong expansion in o i l production in 2009 should help Congo weather the immediate e f f e c t s o f the 
c r is is . A prolonged slump in o i l prices and demand for export products, as we l l as a contraction o f 
foreign direct investment, could however turn into a serious threat to economic stability. 

V. 

The o i l sector provides much needed resources fo r public investments, yet its 
overbearing dominance in the economy i s a major challenge f o r economic management and 
diversification. The key po l icy challenge for Congo is , therefore, to use i t s o i l wealth to bu i ld a more 
diversified and competitive economy and thereby reduce poverty and improve social outcomes. Congo 
should exploit i t s comparative advantages related to i t s natural resource endowment, geographic 
position and climatic conditions to promote non-oil growth. The Government o f Congo i s keen on (i) 
playing an increased role in regional transit, (ii) improving the productivity o f a weak and backward 
agriculture sector, (iii) promoting the smart exploitation o f its large forestry resources, and (iv) 
developing i t s mining sector. 
v i . 
T o achieve its economic potential, the Government plans to address its huge 
infrastructure gap, improve a poor investment climate, promote efficiency in the use o f public 
resources, and strengthen human capital and public institutions. A f te r an extensive consultation 
process, Congo’s first full PRSP was adopted in Ap r i l 2008. The PRSP has f ive pillars: (i) improving 
governance and consolidating peace and security; (ii) promoting growth and macroeconomic stability; 
(iii) enhancing access to basic social services; (iv) improving the social environment and integration 
o f vulnerable groups; and (v) combating H IV /A IDS . The Bank has been supporting this process 
through the Interim Strategy Note ( ISN ) which was reviewed by the Board in July 2007. 

1 

The ISN was designed to enhance governance and create the foundations fo r equitable 

v i i . 
growth. The ISN suggested three strategic entry points: the H IPC process w i th triggers for 
Completion Point covering key governance issues; the PRSP process to bu i ld up a consensus on 
economic policies; and the strengthening o f key human development and poverty alleviation programs 
in urban and rural areas. 

Most o f the 12 I S N outcomes have not been fully achieved. These outcomes were far too 

v i i i . 
many in view o f IDA ’S small resource envelope for Congo, and were not realistic. The lessons learned 
from I S N implementation have been taken into account in designing the Country Partnership Strategy. 

ix . 

I n line with PRSP priorities and after extensive consultations with stakeholders, the 
Bank’s support to the Government‘s efforts will be organized around two main priority areas, 

namely support to: (i) diversification and growth, and (ii) poverty reduction through improved basic 
service delivery. To ensure effective implementation in both pr ior i ty areas, the CPS w i l l also support 
governance and institutional bu i ld ing as a cross-cutting theme. The new role o f the Bank in Congo i s 
to be a catalyst for change. I t w i l l use i t s l im i ted resources to help Congo use its significant revenues 
for economic reform and poverty alleviation, in close coordination w i th other partners. 

X. 

The CPS will contribute to PRSP implementation through seven specific outcomes: (i) 

more effective management o f o i l revenues and public expenditure; (ii) enhanced agricultural 
productivity and marketing; (iii) better tools for improved forestry management; (iv) a foundation for 
MSME growth; (v) improved infrastructure service delivery; (vi) a foundation for increasing Congo’s 
market share in regional transit services; and (v i i) improved basic services. 

x i . 
portfolio o f five projects (three o f which w i l l receive additional financing, viz. the education, 

The Bank w i l l support the government through careful management o f its existing 

H IV /A IDS , and governance projects), new financing fo r four projects, and analytical work and 

policy dialogue. The new projects proposed include: (i) an economic diversification support project to 
stimulate broad-based growth; (ii) a regional telecommunications project to enhance Congo’s transit 
role in the region, and extend the usageheduce prices o f broadband network services; (iii) an urban 
and water services project to improve services to poor neighborhoods; and (iv) a forestry project to 
support ongoing sectoral reforms. In view o f l im i ted I D A resources, the Government has agreed, in 
principle, to finance a large share o f project costs. Advisory services w i l l focus on H IPC completion, a 
Public Expenditure Review, support to o i l revenue management, an analysis o f the l i n k s between 
growth and employment, assistance to Congo to j o i n carbon markets, and statistical capacity building. 

x i i . 

The program has been developed in close coordination with Congo’s key partners, both 
external (AFD, AfDB, EU, IMF) and internal (IFC). Activities. supported by the program w i l l 

complement those already initiated by these institutions or planned under their assistance programs as 
shown in the results matrix in Annex 1. The country programs o f the f i r s t three institutions were 
approved in 2008, and i t i s envisaged that a jo in t CPS could be formulated in 2012. 

x i i i . 
CPS implementation w i l l face significant risks. The contagion effects from the global 
economic c r i s i s could become more serious, especially i f a prolonged global recession would force 
severe cuts in public spending and lead to f i s c a l slippages. The country could fa l l back into conflict i f 
forthcoming elections are poorly managed. The governance agenda, including procurement reform, 
may be delayed. Strong pressures from the unions may lead the Government to postpone putting key 
infrastructure enterprises under private management. Over the past year, the dialogue w i th the 
Government has considerably improved and recen t progress in meeting the H IPC Completion Point 
triggers i s an indication o f increased ownership o f reforms. The Bank w i l l carefblly monitor the 
situation and provide support to reformers when needed.

COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 
FOR THE REPUBL IC OF CONGO 

I. INTRODUCT ION 
1. 
In 2000, Congo emerged f rom a bru ta l c i v i l con f l ic t , and in 2002, the Bank reengaged in 
the country. A Trans i t iona l Support Strategy fo r FY03 -FY06 was reviewed by the Execu t ive 
D irec tors in August 2003 and an Interim Strategy No te FY07 -FY09 in Ju ly 2007. I t was designed 
to se rve as a bridge between the trans i t iona l strategy and comp le t ion o f the full Pover ty 
Reduc t ion Strategy Paper (PRSP). I t s ob jec t ive was t o scale up the governance focus and create 
the foundations fo r equitable grow th . This Coun try Partnership Strategy (CPS) i s based on the 
full PRSP, wh ich was approved by the Government in April 2008. This CPS was designed in 
close coord ina t ion with a l l stakeholders, inc lud ing the IFC , and prov ides a framework fo r Bank 
support fo r F Y 1 O-FY 12. 

A. 

POLITICAL CONTEXT 

11. COUNTRY CONTEXT 

2 . 

The Republic o f Congo has the potential fo r building a strong and robust economy 
as a gateway to the sub-region, and attaining a high standard o f living fo r its people: a 
re la t ive ly sma l l popu la t ion o f 3.8 m i l l i o n ( o f wh ich over h a l f l ives in urban areas), a s ign i f ican t 
endowment o f o i l , na tura l forests, arable land, a b iod ive rs i ty o f g loba l importance, minerals, and 
a strategic loca t ion in Cen tra l A f r i c a with a deep-sea po r t at Po in te-No ire . However, economic 
g row th was severely hampered by heavy state in terven t ion in the economy in the 1970s and 
1980s and recurrent con f l ic ts in the 1990s, wh ich ravaged the infrastructure and destroyed pub l ic 
ins t i tu t ions . 
3 . 
Since the ceasefire in 2000 and adoption o f the new Constitution in 2002, the 
country has been largely at peace. A l though the po l i t ica l environment remains fragile, the 
country has made substantial progress in rebu i ld ing the state and conso l ida t ing peace. Congo i s 
n ow in the midst o f i t s second election cycle since the end o f war: leg is la t ive elections were held 
in mid-2007, and the next presidential election i s scheduled fo r Ju ly 2009. In June 2008, the 
government reached a po l i t ica l settlement with Pastor N t o um i - the leader o f a rebe l movement 
(known as the N in jas ) in the Poo l region, the on ly rema in ing belligerent element in the country's 
c i v i l war. The disarmament o f his estimated 5,000 fo l lowe rs started in February 2009, and so far, 
2,800 weapons have been collected. Prospects fo r full restoration o f peace o f fe r Congo a unique 
oppor tun i ty fo r focus ing i t s full attention on strengthening i t s s t i l l fledgling institutions, and 
s t imu la t ing robust economic g row th in order t o combat pover ty and inequa l i ty . 
4. 
This institution building and economic renaissance process will be greatly facilitated 
by stronger regional integration. Congo i s a member o f several reg iona l bodies, such as: the 
Organ iza t ion for Ha rmon iza t ion o f Businnes L a w in A f r i c a (Organisation pour I 'Harmonisation 
en Afiique du D r o i t des Affaires - OHADA ) , wh ich aims at harmon iz ing commerc ia l law in 
Francophone A f r ica ; the Econom ic Commun i ty fo r Cen tra l A f r ican States (Communaute' 
Economique des Etats de IY f i ique Centrale, CEEAC), w h i c h fosters trade and economic 
cooperation among the Central A f r ican member states; and the Central A f r ican Econom ic and 
Mone ta ry Commun i ty (Communaute' Economique e t Mone'taire de IY f i ique Centrale, CEMAC ) , 
wh i ch maintains monetary and exchange rate po l ic ies among i t s s ix members'. As discussed later, 
full imp lemen ta t ion o f the commitments under these ins t i tu t ions wou ld go a long way in

ECONOMIC CONTEXT 

7 . 

i) Recent Economic Developments and Medium Term Prospects 
Congo has made significant progress on economic stabilization and “first 
generation” structural reforms since the end o f civil strife in 2000. GD P at constant prices 
nearly doub led f rom 2002 (US$735 m i l l i o n ) to 2008 (US$1,425 m i l l ion ) , while in f la t ion has 
remained broad ly under con tro l . The in terna t iona l environment was cer ta in ly favorable, as the 
surge in w o r l d o i l prices helped Congo imp rove i t s f isca l and external positions. Nonetheless, 
strengthened macroeconomic policies, mos t no tab ly o n f isca l d isc ip l ine and debt management 
also p layed a key ro le in Congo’s economic recovery. Bas ic ins t i tu t ions f o r economic 
management carry out the ir roles reasonably well, even though they are s t i l l hampered by l o w 
capacity. 
8. 
Economic performance has been strongly affected by swings in production levels 
and o i l prices, exacerbated by the onset o f the global financial c r is is in recent months. As 
table 2 shows, GDP contracted in 2007 by 1.6 percent in rea l te rms , mos t ly due to an accident on 
a ma jor o i l platform, w h i c h led to a sharp drop in o i l produc t ion . This illustrates the dominant 
ro le o f o i l in the economy. O i l produc t ion recovered strongly in 2008, but this was pa r t ia l ly o f fse t 
b y the onset o f the g loba l f inanc ia l cr is is in the second par t o f the year. Rea l GDP g row th in 2008 
was 5.6 percent. 
9. 
Economic growth i s expected to accelerate i n 2009 and 2010, before sharply 
dropping in 2011. This g row th i s large ly driven by o i l production. Curren t projections foresee a 
strong increase in o i l ou tpu t in the nex t two years, thanks to new concessions com ing o n stream. 
This wou ld lead to a peak in o i l produc t ion in 2010, fo l lowed by a gradual decline in subsequent 
years as o i l we l ls start gradua l ly drying up (see Figure 1 be lo^)^. This o i l produc t ion trajectory 
wou ld prope l rea l GDP g row th t o a pro jec ted 9.5 percent in 2009 and 11.9 percent in 2010, 
fo l lowed by a f a l l to 1.1 percent in 20 1 1, in tandem with the projected decline in o i l output4. Non - 
o i l GDP g row th has seen a decline since m id-2008 due to the impac t o f the g loba l f inanc ia l cr is is 
on some export-related sectors (especially timber). This impac t i s expected t o worsen in 2009, 
w i t h non -o i l g row th pro jec ted at 3.5 percent against 5.4 percent in 2008, be fore i t wou ld 
gradua l ly recover in 20 10 and 20 1 1. I n f l a t i o n remained subdued in recent years, but accelerated 
to 5.3 percent in 2008, ma in ly due t o food and energy pr ice hikes early in the year. I t i s projected 
t o stay at around 3 - 4 percent in com ing years, as demand i s expected t o rema in l o w because o f 
the crisis. 
10. 
The strengthening o f Congo’s external position over the past years has helped build 
a solid cushion o f international reserves. D r i v e n b y h igher o i l export earnings, Congo’s current 
account de f ic i t over recent years has dec l ined to 6.6 percent o f non -o i l GDP in 2008. The cap i ta l 
and f inanc ia l balance also improved due t o higher net d irec t and short t e r m investments (mos t ly 
related to the o i l sector). As a result, the ove ra l l balance o f payments registered a surplus o f 21.8 
percent o f GDP in 2008 and gross in terna t iona l rese rves grew to a very com for tab le leve l o f 14.1 
months o f imports. This “cushion” i s c r i t ica l in the face o f the curren t ly l o w o i l prices and the 
impac t o f the g loba l cr is is on the external pos i t ion in the months ahead. Indeed, t h e current 
account balance i s pro jec ted to f a l l considerably to -18.9 percent o f GD P in 2009, due to the 
s low-down in o i l prices and the f a l l in in terna t iona l demand fo r other export goods, in par t icu lar 

~~ 

This trajectory i s based on conservative projections and could change i f new significant commercially 
viable re se rve s a r e found and brought into production. 
This projected decline in growth precedes t h e recent arrival o f the global financial cr is is , although the 
c r i s i s could aggravate it, i f it undermines f b t u r e exploration.

timber. As net cap i ta l in f lows are also projected t o decrease, the ove ra l l balance o f payments i s 
projected to turn in to a de f ic i t o f 3.6 percen t o f GDP in 2009.

Fiscal performance strengthened markedly in 2008, enabling the start o f a new 
three-year PRGF program supported by the IMF in October 2008. Adhering t o an e f fec t ive 
f isca l po l icy i s pa r t icu la r ly cr i t ica l , given that monetary and exchange rate po l ic ies are se t by the 
reg iona l monetary body (CEMAC ) . In this regard, Congo has met a l l but one o f CEMAC ’ s 
convergence cr i ter ia in the latest assessment by the Convergence Comm i t tee (see Box 1). The 
2008 f isca l targets o f the PRGF were respected and a substantial reduc t ion in the non -o i l p r ima ry 
balance achieved. Par t icu lar ly encouraging was the continued improvemen t in performance o f 
non -o i l revenue co l lec t ion and the prudent approach t o increasing spending in sp i te o f the o i l 
revenue w ind fa l l registered in the f i r s t h a l f o f the year. In reac t ion t o the f a l l in o i l prices starting 
late 2008, the Government adopted a prudent f isca l stance in the 2009 budget. A considerable 
reduc t ion in current spending i s envisaged, while ma in ta in ing the planned cautious expansion in 
pub l ic investment. The latter i s aimed at o f fse t t ing the impac t o f the in terna t iona l f inanc ia l cr is is 
on the economy. Spending con t ro l i s also in con fo rm i ty with the need fo r long t e r m adjustment o f 
the high non -o i l p r ima ry de f ic i t (45 percent o f non -o i l GDP in 2008), wh ich i s n o t sustainable, 
especially g iven that o i l produc t ion i s projected t o decline gradua l ly f r om 201 1 onwards. 
12. 
Congo’s external debt situation has improved significantly since 2006, and will do so 
further once the H IPC Completion Point i s reached. Since the Dec is ion Po in t in M a r c h 2006, 
Congo’s net pub l ic debt has declined s ign i f ican t ly , f rom to ta l-deb t- to-GDP o f 199 percent at end- 
2004 to 58 percent at end-2008. This i s ma in ly due t o in te r im debt r e l i e f granted in the context o f 
the H IPC process, mos t no tab ly through two substantial agreements with the London C lub o f 
pr iva te creditors in Novembe r 2007 (cancellation o f U S $ l . 6 b i l l i o n in outstanding debt) and with 
the Paris C lub in December 2008 (cancellation o f US$805 m i l l i o n and rescheduling o f U S $ l 5 5 
m i l l ion ) . In spite o f these s ign i f ican t improvements in debt ratios, the mos t recent Debt

Sustainability Ana lys is (DSA)’ conducted by Bank and Fund concludes that Congo’s gross 
external debt i s at high risk o f d is t ress . This assessment reflects ma in ly Congo’s vu lne rab i l i ty t o

Box 1: CEMAC Convergence Criteria 

As a member o f the regional monetary union, Congo i s committed to respecting the CEMAC Convergence 
Criteria. These Criteria have been updated in 2002. They are monitored through a regular multilateral 
surveillance process by a Convergence Committee, composed o f representatives o f the West Afiican 
Economic and Monetary Union, t h e CEMAC, the Union o f the Comoros, and France. The Committee 
provides concrete recommendations to member states on strengthening policies with a view to meeting a l l 
criteria. The la tes t assessment o f the Committee o f Ap r i l 2008 concluded that Congo had met a l l targets for 
the primary indicators, with the exception o f the debt target (see table below). In regional comparison, only 
Benin and Cameroon had met a l l targets in 2007. Congo’s situation i s not expected t o have changed 
radically s ince the Ap r i l 2008 assessment, as the presentation o f latest data related to the indicators reveals.

ii) Real Sector Development - the Dominance o f O i l 
13. 
Congo’s economy has experienced positive growth since the end o f the civil war. 

Rea l GD P g row th in 2001-2008 averaged 3.8 percent and par t icu lar ly encouraging was the strong 
non -o i l growth, wh ich averaged 7.6 percent over the same period. This record needs t o be 
qualified, though, by the fac t that most economic ac t iv i t ies were at a l o w po in t at the end o f the 
c i v i l war. O i l production, in contrast, s l igh t ly contracted during the pe r iod (-0.9 percent), large ly 
due t o a s ign i f ican t drop in produc t ion in 2007 (-17.2 percent). 
14. 

Thanks to the increase in o i l prices over the past years, however, the o i l sector 
expanded significantly in nominal terms, increasing further its share in overall output. The 

share o f o i l in nom ina l GDP has g rown f r om 59 percent in 2001 to 69 percent in 2008. As shown 
in Table 4, the weight o f non -o i l sectors in the economy i s small; the second largest sector 
(services) on ly amounted to 21 percent o f nom ina l GD P in 2008. The we igh t o f non -o i l sectors 
has decreased over the past years, due to un favorab le re la t ive pr ice and exchange rate 
developments, and key g row th constraints related to infrastructure and an unfavorable business

Box 2: Congo’s O i l Sector 
O i l production started in 1957, and during the 1980s and 199Os, Congo’s crude production quadrupled, 
from 65,000 barrels per day in 1980 to an average o f 280,000 barrels per day in 2000, mos t ly f rom offshore 
fields. Fo l low ing a decline in the early 2000s, production increased from 227,400 barrels per day in 2004 to 
288,000 barrels per day in 2008, thanks to new investment and increased o i l recovery f rom mature fields, 
making Congo the 4” largest o i l producer in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, i f no new major discoveries a re 
made, o i l production i s projected to gradually dec l ine after 2010. 
O i l prices rose from an annual average o f US$17 per barrel during 1975-79 to about US$33 per barrel in 
the f i r s t h a l f o f the 1980s. In 1981, the Government adopted an ambitious five-year development plan. 
Public investment increased b y an annual average o f 15 percent between the second h a l f o f the 1970s and 
the first h a l f o f the 1980s. During that period, the Government mortgaged a substantial por t ion o f i t s o i l 
earnings through oil-backed loans that contributed to a grow ing debt burden and chronic revenue shortfalls. 
The o i l bonanza came to an end in the second h a l f o f the 198Os, however, when o i l prices declined to an 
annual average o f about US$18.50 per barrel during 1985-89. L im i ted adjustment led to a long-term 
economic cr is is , wh ich contributed significantly to the internal conflicts o f the late 1990s. 
Today, most o i l production i s carried out under production sharing agreements. Ma jo r external partners a re 
Total, EN1 and Chevron. The Socie‘te‘ Nat iona le des Petroles du Congo (SNPC), the national o i l company, 
i s the Government’s counterpart to international companies in these agreements. In September 2008, SNPC 
started o i l exploitation on i t s own on a small onshore well. 
SNPC’s o i l commercialization and accounting practices a re not yet up to international standards, resulting 
in Government achieving o i l revenue levels we l l below their potential. A key factor was the fear o f seizure 
o f o i l deliveries by “vu l tu re funds”. This problem was solved b y a settlement reached in 2008. Capacity 
bu i ld ing efforts on improv ing effectiveness and transparency at SNPC in commercialization and accounting 
are underway, supported b y the H IPC process. Receipts o f Government o i l sales b y SNPC and private 
operators are transferred in to the treasury account at the BEAC . These transfers are c e r t i f i e d each quarter 
b y KPMG , and published on the in terne t . The d iv is ion o f o i l revenues in to budget spending and saving in 
Congo’s o i l stabilization account at the B E AC i s largely determined b y fiscal targets, wh ich are derived 
from a Permanent-Income mode l that provides a path towards long-term fiscal sustainability. This path 
demands a sharp adjustment over the next years, given the currently high levels o f the non-o i l primary 
deficit. S i n c e 2003, Congo’s overall fiscal balance has been in surplus, enabling the Government to set 
aside substantial amounts in to the stabilization account. 
CORAF, a state-owned re f ine ry , has been in operation fo r the past th ir ty years. I t caters to a narrow 
domestic market (about 7 barre ls per day) and has performed poor ly for most o f i t s existence. Large 
subsidies kept the refinery alive and the prices for domestic consumers low . In 2005, an action plan to 
reduce the unit cost from US$8 per barrel to at most US$5 per barrel was adopted, and i s currently under 
implementation. W i t h the sharp increase in o i l prices, CORAF was able to make a p ro f i t in 2008. W i t h 
further improved performance and improved transport infrastructure, i t could supply the regional market.

1 5 . 
The o i l sector provides much needed resources fo r public investments yet its 
overbearing dominance in the economy i s a major challenge fo r economic management. The 
o i l sector no t on ly makes up the l ion ’s share in production, but has also con tr ibu ted 93 percent t o 
exports and 84 percent to government revenues on average f r om 2005 t o 2008. O i l revenues bring 
the benefit o f re la t ive ly large resources fo r f inanc ing pub l ic spending (the a l loca t ion o f about 
US$1 b i l l i o n to the investment budget per year i s large re la t ive t o the size o f Congo’s economy). 
However, this dependence o n o i l revenues poses challenges due t o the vo la t i le and f i n i t e 
character o f the resource (see below). 
16. 
M o r e generally, the reliance on the o i l sector i s problematic f o r the Congolese 
economy, as this sector has a limited capacity to generate employment, and poses an 
inherent obstacle fo r improving competitiveness. The prominence o f the o i l sector, 
in 
particular during the recent o i l pr ice boom, has d iver ted produc t ive resources f r om traditional, 
more labor-intensive exports towards o i l extraction and related ac t iv i t ies . The s ign i f ican t 
appreciation o f the rea l e f fec t ive exchange rate (about 20 percent between 2001 and 2007 
according to the IMF) has led t o erosion in competitiveness. 

iii) Impact o f the Global Financial Crisis 
17. 
The global financial c r is is poses a serious threat to economic stability and growth in 
Congo, but i t i s also an opportunity, as i t gives more urgency to implementing the reform 
agenda. An early assessment has revealed that Congo i s vulnerable t o the effects o f the g loba l 
f inanc ia l crisis ma in ly through the fo l low ing po ten t ia l transmission channels: 
The steep f a l l in prices fo r i t s ma in commod i ty exports ( o i l and t imber) and the f a l l in 
demand fo r Congolese timber (projected at -50 percent fo r 2009), wh ich have a substantial 
negative impac t on the current account (the severe impac t o n the timber industry has already 
led to a s ign i f ican t reduc t ion in employment in this labor-intensive industry tha t i s the 
mainstay o f several towns in the no r th o f the country); 
The sharp drop in f isca l revenues due ma in ly to the f a l l in o i l prices, wh ich - if prices are t o 
stay at their current l o w levels - w i l l lead to a 50 percent reduc t ion in o i l revenue in 2009 
compared to 2008; 
The negative demand e f fec t o n the economy i f pub l ic expenditure leve ls have t o be reduced 
in case the o i l p r ice shock becomes more severe or prolonged; 
The drop in Fo re ign D i rec t Investment, wh ich cou ld experience a ma jo r reduc t ion in the 
med ium term , i f o i l companies reduce their investments related d i rec t ly o r ind i rec t ly to 
extraction; 
The risk o f con tag ion o f the loca l f inanc ia l sector, wh ich i s considered re la t ive ly sma l l at this 
point, as Congo’s f inanc ia l sector i s underdeveloped and no t well integrated in to the g loba l 
markets. 
Although large o i l savings and balance of payment surpluses accumulated over the 
past years provide Congo with room fo r maneuver to face the cr is is , a deterioration o f the 
situation o r a delay in recovery could result in a difficult economic situation. The authorities 
have taken on a re la t ive ly pruden t f isca l stance fo r 2009, wh ich aims at reduc ing current 
spending, while ma in ta in ing the planned expansion o f pub l ic investment. This should, together 
with the cushion o f the o i l savings and accumulated fore ign reserves, protect the coun try f r om a 
precarious f isca l and external s i tua t ion fo r the moment. However , i f any o r several o f the e f f e c t s 
o f the c r i s i s described above become more severe o r i f the o i l prices and demand fo r other export 
goods f a i l t o recover within the nex t few months, Congo might face a dire f isca l and external 
situation and serious reversal o f i t s pa th t o economic expansion, 

18.

19. 
Responding to the c r is is will require further progress on maintaining fiscal 
discipline and increasing spending efficiency, as well as accelerating structural reforms. To 
avoid jeopardizing much needed public investments in critical infrastructure, controlling spending 
(particularly in the current budget) by reducing nonessential spending items w i l l become even 
more urgent. The same applies to following through w i th structural reforms, particularly those 
aimed at promoting diversification. In this sense, the crisis i s also an opportunity, as i t gives more 
urgency and facilitates political consensus on implementing the reform agenda. 
In. COUNTRY CHALLENGES AND STRATEG IC PR IOR IT IES 

A. MAIN CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES 

20. 

The key policy challenge for Congo i s to use its o i l wealth to build a more diversified 
and competitive economy and, thereby, reduce poverty and improve social policy outcomes. 
I n order to take advantage o f this opportunity, the d i f f icu l t economic and governance challenges 
that come w i th the economy’s strong dependence on o i l w i l l have to be addressed, including 
strengthening i t s capacity in budget and public financial management. Beyond this, however, i s 
the imperative to diversify t h e economy progressively away from o i l by developing Congo’s non- 
o i l economy in order to generate stable income and employment opportunities and add value to 
the country’s other resources. Finally, there w i l l be a need to improve basic service delivery and 
strengthening public institutions, not just as a pre-requisite for sustained growth, but also to make 
sure that the growth outcomes are we l l distributed among the Congolese people in order to help 
reduce poverty and inequality. 
i) Enhancing Transparency and Effectiveness in Oil Revenue Management 
21. 
Sound policies and practices in managing the different steps in the o i l value chain 
are critical fo r seizing the opportunity offered by Congo’s o i l wealth. This includes 
maximizing o i l revenues through favorable contractual agreements w i th o i l companies, 
improving o i l revenue projections, maintaining prudent levels o f spending in view o f long term 
f i s c a l sustainability, and smoothing the impact o f o i l price volatility. Consolidating ongoing 
efforts on increasing transparency and effectiveness in the management o f the national o i l 
company (SNPC) and in i t s financial relations w i th o i l producers and the treasury i s important in 
order to reduce arbitrary and ineffective decision making in the management o f this c r i t ica l 
resource. 
22. 
The finite character o f Congo’s o i l poses difficult challenges f o r o i l revenue and 
fiscal management policies. According to the latest projections based on proven reserves, Congo 
w i l l s t i l l benefit from very substantial o i l revenues for the next two years but w i l l have to adapt to 
a gradual decline in these revenues from 2011 onwards6. Figure 1 depicts the projected o i l 
production profile and level o f o i l revenue over the next years. Even assuming a slow recovery o f 
o i l prices over the coming years from their current low level, o i l revenues w i l l provide very 
substantial amounts o f resources for the country to invest in enhancing i t s infrastructure. On 
average, from 2009 to 2014, annual o i l revenues are projected at FCFA 3,385 b i l l ion (about 
US $ 6 . 8 billion). This w i l l allow the Government to continue i t s current public investment outlays 
o f about FCFA 600 b i l l ion (US$1.2 billion) per year, which i s huge given the size o f the 
Congolese economy. 

As indicated ea r l ie r , this trajectory could change i f new significant commercially viable re se rve s are 
found and brought in to production. 

8 

23. 
Managing volatility o f o i l prices i s another critical challenge, as the recent 
experience with the steep fall in prices in the second half o f 2008 has clearly illustrated. As 
more than 80 percent o f government revenues stem from o i l revenues, o i l price volatility makes i t 
d i f f icu l t for the authorities to maintain continuity in levels o f public spending. Currently, Congo 
i s managing this volatility through a stabilization fund held at the BEAC, coupled w i th the use o f 
an o i l reference price for budgeting. Due to the positive price trends over the past years, Congo 
has been able to feed the stabilization fund w i th considerable amounts o f o i l revenue savings. In 
2009, the government i s considering using some o f these reserves, in case the o i l price f a l l s below 
the re ference point adopted in the budget (US$43 per barrel for Congolese oil). While the current 
approach to stabilization i s generally functioning, i t could be rendered more transparent and 
predictable, including by institutionalizing i t through a legal framework. 
Congo has come some way in improving effectiveness and efficiency in o i l sector 
management, but critical reforms are still outstanding. In t e rm s o f transparency, main 
achievements include the certification o f o i l receipts by external auditors and their publication on 
the in te rne t on a quarterly basis. In 2008, Congo reached candidate status in the E I T I process. 
Structural reforms underway include o i l marketing and accounting practices o f the national o i l 
company (SNPC), and the upgrading o f the national re f ine ry in Pointe-Noire. These reform 
efforts w i l l have to be consolidated and complemented by actions aimed at clarifying and making 
more transparent the fiscal relationship between the national o i l company and the budget, 
institutionalizing f i s c a l rules and savings-versus-spending policies, and improving management 
o f o i l revenue surpluses at the BEAC .

ii) Strengthening Capacity in Budget and Public Financial Management 
2 5 . 
A comprehensive public financial management action plan i s under implementation 
since March 2008, aiming at addressing weak capacity and he lack o f openness o f budgetary 
and public financial management institutions in Congo. The action plan provides a framework 
to advance on reforms aimed at improving the quality o f programming and executing budgetary 

9 

26. 

resources, which i s critical for the effective use o f the o i l wealth. Given the substantial resources 
available for public investments, enhancing capacity in managing projects financed by the budget 
i s o f particular importance. But the quality o f budget and public financial management does not 
only depend on strengthening government institutions, but also on facilitating public access to 
essential budget information and increasing the capacity o f non-governmental actors to 
understand this information. 
Advancing on public financial management and budget management reforms will 
require to focus e f fo r t s on a few priority measures, most o f them already underway. These 
measures are related to the different dimensions o f the budget management chain: 
Budget preparation. With the PRSP, there i s now a solid general strategic framework fo r 
the preparation o f the budget. However, more detailed guidance on allocating budget 
resources i s required through well developed sector strategies. Efforts a re underway to 
elaborate such strategies, which today only exist in a few sectors (health, education and 
transport). The introduction o f a three-year rolling Medium Term Expenditure 
Framework (MTEF) i s a c r i t i c a l step for translating PRSP priorities into the budget and 
ensuring consistency with available resources. The MTEF reform has started and key 
elements (macroeconomic framework, central MTEF and 2-3 sector MTEFs) should be in 
place for the preparation o f the 20 10 budget. 
Budget execution. Monitoring and control systems on budget execution remain 
inadequate. A particularly serious challenge i s the reform o f budget execution 
procedures, including internal controls, which are overly complex and cumbersome and 
give r i s e to substantial fiduciary risks. Theses weaknesses encourage recourse to 
emergency spending procedures (“paymen t par an t ic ipa t ion ” ) . Although they have 
become less frequent, they are s t i l l used, especially in the context o f public works. 
Implementing the Government’s reform plan for computerizing and simplifying budget 
execution procedures i s therefore a high priority. 
Public investment management. Programming and execution o f public investment has 
been hampered by limitations on strategic planning, especially regarding prioritization o f 
infrastructure projects, and clarification o f institutional roles in selecting, preparing, 
appraising, and monitoring projects. A public investment management action plan was 
adopted in early 2009 to address this challenge. 
Procurement. A new procurement code i s near adoption. This code and the institutional 
changes that i t s application w i l l require are critical to redress current procurement 
practices, which are marked by a lack o f competition, transparency and poor contract 
management, 

External controls. Efforts to introduce “checks and balances” on budgetary management 
since the end o f the c iv i l war need to be consolidated. Priorities in this regard are 
measures to: (i) improve the quality and availability o f Government accounts; (ii) 
strengthen the Court o f Accounts (Cow des Comptes) which was created in 2005; and 
(iii) to bring the preparation o f budget reporting laws ( lo is de rkg lemen t ) and their 
examination by the Court o f Accounts up to date. 

Reporting on budget r e s u l t s . There have been important efforts to improve the quality and 
availability o f reports on budget results to parliament and the public. Basic budget data i s 
made available to the public, including by posting reports on the Government’s website, 
albeit with interruptions and delays. Discussions at the Parliament on the budget are 
broadcast on national television.

iii) Potential Sectors fo r Non-Oil Growth 
27. 
Congo should exploit its comparative advantages related to its geographic position 
and natural resource endowment to promote non-oil growth. A priori, sectors w i th strong 
growth potential include transport services, agribusiness, forestry and mining. 
TranspodTransit services. Thanks to i t s deep sea port in Pointe-Noire, the only one in 
t h e sub-region, Congo has a great potential to play a major t rans i t role for the Congo 
River Basin countries. The development o f the transport infrastructure has great potential 
to boost the local economy and intra-regional trade. This w i l l accrue direct benefits 
associated w i th construction activities, port services, and transport services like the 
trucking industry, etc., as we l l as indirect bene f i ts in t h e form o f lower transport costs and 
productivity gains, and improved access to domestic and regional markets. 
Agriculture. Congo has a considerable potential for agricultural production, but currently 
the output from the sector covers less than 30 percent o f the country's food needs, w i th 
the r e s t imported. Once cross-border connections are improved and trade barriers 
lowered, huge potential markets for Congolese agricultural products would be reachable, 
including the 10 m i l l ion strong Kinshasa market, which i s only a short distance away 
across the river from Brazzaville. Yet, out o f 10 m i l l ion hectares o f arable land, only 2 
percent i s currently exploited. 
Forestry. Covering over 65% o f the Congo's land area, forests are key to the social and 
economic l i f e o f the country and a strategic asset to the global environment. Forest 
management practices and degradation trends vary profoundly between the north o f the 
country where forests are better managed and preserved, and the south where population 
density i s higher, law enforcement weaker and degradation more pronounced. More than 
12% o f Congo's land area has been se t aside as biodiversity reserve and national parks, 
and progressive forest management ru les and monitoring systems are increasingly 
adopted. Progress i s also being made in recognizing and strengthening traditional rights 
o f forest communities and indigenous populations. Between 2000 and 2005, industrial 
forest output doubled, and local processing increased significantly. The international 
f inanc ia l crisis hit the Congolese forest sector ea r l ie r and more heavily than any other 
country in the sub-region: several companies have halted production and a few have 
closed. Nonetheless, m i d and long term prospects for the forest industry remain strong 
while additional forest-based sources o f income are emerging through tourism and global 
trade o f environmental services (see Box 3). 
Mining. There are strong indications o f deposits o f magnesium, gold, diamonds, potash 
and iron, but exploration has been extremely limited so far. Negotiations w i th investors 
for concessions are at different stages. A mining code was enacted in 2005, but 
implementing decrees have not yet been issued.

Box 3: Congo’s Forests and Environment 
Forests a re important to the Congolese economy, and to the global environment. They account for 10% o f 
non-oil GDP, 12,000 jobs, US$200 m i l l ion o f exports, and US$40 m i l l ion in f i s c a l revenues. Additional 
contributions to the national economy, not captured by statistics, include bush-meat (critical t o the nutrition 
o f the rural poor) and wood for domestic energy and building materials. Industrial output doubled between 
2000 and 2005 along with the l o c a l processing capacity currently estimated at over 60% o f production 
(although production has recently slowed down due to the current global economic cr is is) . Congo i s 
positioning i t s e l f as a potential provider o f environmental s e r v i c e s to the emerging global markets and i s 
giving more prominence to its national parks as an international tourist attraction. 
Convinced that i f we l l managed forests can help diversify the economy and contribute to sustainable 
growth, the Government demonstrated leadership in completing a comprehensive forest and environmental 
sector study in collaboration with a wide range o f national and international constituencies and the World 
Bank. This study provided a candid analysis o f challenges and opportunities, and served to indentify the 
forest and environment policy measures to be met in the fiamework o f the HIPC Completion Point. 
Whereas good progress has been made on the policy fiont, the study concluded that many issues must be 
tackled to secure sustainability o f the forest resource base, and set the stage for continued economic 
growth. The following needs were highlighted among others: strengthening institutional capacity; adopting 
and enforcing environmental safeguards; creating incentives to ensure that a more balanced m ix o f forest 
t r e e species are utilized and local transformation and value addition are increased; improving governance 
and enforcement o f forest laws and regulation; correcting unresponsive taxation policies; stepping up 
policies and programs that support rural and indigenous populations i n l iv ing in forest areas; improving 
management and promoting tourism in natural parks and creating capacity in the new areas o f forest carbon 
trade. 
The experience o f recen t years has demonstrated that policy reforms alone a re not sufficient to realize the 
potential o f forests and that these must be accompanied by specific investments and work programs in the 
field. W i th this in mind the Government has requested the World Bank to complement the support i t i s 
already receiving from the EU, France and the African Development Bank and f inance a comprehensive 
program o f investment and innovation in the field o f forests and the environment. 

iv) Addressing M a in Structural and Sectoral Constraints to Non-Oil Growth 

28 . 

S t imu la t ing g row th in the above sectors w i l l require, among other things, tack l ing 
impediments to the p romo t ion o f Congo’s po ten t ia l as a transport hub, enhancing i t s investment 
and business climate, p romo t ing e f f ic iency in the use o f i t s pub l ic resources, imp rov ing i t s human 
capital, and strengthening i t s pub l ic institutions. 

a) Promoting Congo’s Potential as a Transport Hub/Fostering Regional Integration 
29 . 
Implementing Reg iona l In i t ia t ives . Regaining the country’s critical ro l e as a gateway 
to the world f o r its landlocked o r quasi-landlocked (e.g. Democratic Republic o f Congo) 
neighbors will require vigorous implementation o f various regional initiatives. A l though 

Congo’s trade with ne ighbor ing countries i s s t i l l a tiny share o f i t s to ta l external trade, the re i s 
po ten t ia l fo r growth, especially in agr icu l tura l products. As a small country close t o some o f the 
sub-region’s b i g markets, Congo stands to benefit f r om greater reg iona l in tegra t ion by expo r t ing 
o r p ro v id ing services .(such as transit services) to these markets. However, tak ing advantage o f 
these marke t opportunities requ ires the Government to implement i t s reg iona l comm i tmen ts 
under the various reg iona l ins t i tu t ions such as OHADA, CEEAC , and C EM A C . This wou ld also 
fac i l i ta te Congo’s ro le as a transit coun try . 

12 

30. 
Deve lop ing key transport corr idors . Regaining its historical transit ro l e will also 
require improving transport infrastructure and transport services, especially on key 
transport corridors. The poo r state o f Congo’s transport infrastructure makes i t unable to 
support the needed economic d ive rs i f ica t ion in to such areas as transit services, forestry, 
agr icu l ture and mining, o r extend qua l i ty basic services t o i t s popu la t ion . The reach o f the r a i l and 
road ne twork i s l im i ted , and i t s cond i t ion poor, with i n s u f i c i e n t maintenance carr ied out. The 
once thriving r ive r transport up the Congo R ive r f rom Brazzav i l le to Bangui has been reduced to 
minimum capacity due t o silting o f the river and l im i ted po r t and transport capacity. L a c k o f a 
br idge be tween Brazzav i l le and Kinshasa remains a bottleneck to increased trade between the two 
ne ighbor ing countries. 
The main transport corridors are: the Point-Noire - Brazzaville ra i l and road 
31. 
corridor, the Brazzaville - Sangha northern river corridor, and the Brazzaville - Kinshasa 
cross-river corridor. M a j o r investments in the po r t o f Po in t -No i re a re underway, as well as 
concessioning arrangements fo r the ra i lway l i n e be tween Po in te-No ire and Brazzav i l le , and 
cons truc t ion o f the accompanying road link. Investment options and development plans are e i ther 
yet to be developed or are s t i l l under discussion fo r the Brazzav i l le port, the Brazzav i l le-K inshasa 
cross-river stretch, and the Brazzaville-Sangha r ive r corr idor . Apa r t f r om phys ica l infrastructure, 
p romo t ing transit services w i l l also en ta i l imp rov ing customs procedures to make them more 
efficient, establishing an appropriate regu la tory framework, 
instituting revenue sharing 
mechanisms w i t h ne ighbor ing countries’, and imp rov ing transport infrastructure maintenance, 
inc lud ing trans form ing the current Road Maintenance Fund in to a second generation road fund. 
32. 
Imp rov ing Te lecommun ica t ion Infrastructure. Similarly, good telecommunication 
infrastructure i s needed for robust economic growth and regional integration. The qua l i ty o f 
Congo’s f ixed l i n e te lecommun ica t ion ne two rk and the p rov is ion o f basic vo ice telephony 
services are poor . Severe funding shortages have rendered the p r inc ipa l operator unable to 
pe r fo rm the needed repairs t o the ne two rk wh ich was severely damaged during the c i v i l 
disturbances o f the 1990s. W h i l e wireless penetration has surpassed fixed l i n e te ledens i ty since 
1999, and the three GSM-based mob i le operators have curren t ly more than 2 m i l l i o n s active 
subscribers (as o f October 2008), the absence o f modern backbone infrastructure at the na t iona l 
leve l i s a ma jo r limiting factor. M o s t telecommunication operators do no t have broadband 
terrestrial networks and re ly o n expensive and poor qua l i ty satellite connec t iv i ty t o link cities at 
the na t iona l leve l . InternationaVregional connec t iv i ty i s also poor . 
b) Enhancing the Investment and Business Climate/Promoting MSMEs 
33 . 
The very low rank o f Congo in the Doing Business Ratings (178 out o f 181 countries 
in 2009 ) underscores Congo’s highly uncompetitive business environment. The coun try 
performs poo r ly in a l l assessed categories, especially on taxes, labor laws and regulations, 
property registration, contract enforcement, and trad ing across borders. In addition, the coun try i s 
characterized b y a very sma l l pr iva te sector, a legacy o f i t s Ma rx is t past that favored c iv i l-serv ice 
aspirations 
(‘tfonctionariat’) over entrepreneurship 
(“entrepreunariat”), as well as an 
underdeveloped financial sector, wh ich provides very limited cred i t t o the economy. So lv ing 
these issues i s c r i t ica l to the emergence o f a robust pr iva te sector’. Experience elsewhere in the 
reg ion has shown that s ign i f ican t and rap id improvements are possible in these areas.

e) Improving Standards of Governance and Transparency 
34. 
Governance and transparency issues constitute the backbone o f the H I P C agenda, a 
reflection of the perceived weaknesses in the governance system o f the Republic o f Congo. 
Whereas some progress was made during the I S N period on transparency issues in the extractive 
industries as discussed in paragraph 23 above, serious issues remain on many aspects o f 
governance. The governance diagnostic study, which was adopted by the Government in March 
2009 highlights, among other things, corruption in revenue collection, in the police force, and in 
the health and education sectors (see Box 4 on proposed mitigation measures). A range o f 
measures have been taken by Government, both on the supply side and on the demand side o f 
governance. Full implementation o f these measures should go a long way in tackling the 
country’s governance challenges. 

Box 4: Governance I s s u e s 
Weaknesses in the governance system o f the Republic o f Congo continue to pose significant risks to progress on 
the country’s development agenda. The diagnostic study on governance and anti-corruption, which was carried 
out during 2008 (finalized i n March 2009 ) and endorsed by government, highlights a deterioration in the quality 
o f service delivery and increased levels o f Corruption in key sectors, compared to the 2003 study financed by 
United Nations Development Program. Perceived levels o f corruption and weak governance in the most affected 
institutions (customs, police and tax authorities) have increased significantly over the said period, while the 
situation in institutions that were hitherto perceived to have the least problems (such as local governments) also 
deteriorated. Corruption was also reported in service delivery institutions, such as schools and hospitals. Despite 
some recent progress, there s t i l l are some governance issues in key public sector enterprises, such as the SNPC. 
The Government has recently launched a se r ies o f initiatives to address the issues cited above. The reinforcement 
o f the National Anti-Corruption Commission and the creation o f the independent ‘Obse rva to i re Lu t te con t re la 
C o r r u p t i o n ’ , anchored i n c iv i l society, have given increased visibility to the issue o f corruption and governance. 
The finalization, in March 2009, o f the draft national Governance and Anti-Corruption Action Plan, and the anti- 
corruption law, are hrther important achievements for these institutions. Both documents are now awaiting 
approval by the Government and, in the latter case, Parliament as well. The Governance and Anti-Corruption 
Action Plan, in particular, se ts out a series o f concrete and measurable actions, and provides a platform for 
moving forward on this important agenda. The adoption and implementation o f action plans on public financial 
management and public investment management, and the impending reform plan on o i l commercialization 
practices, should bring more transparency to public management processes. Finally, important sector initiatives, 
such as the establishment o f national E IT I structures for the o i l sector, the integration o f international 
independent observers into forest control operations, and the publication o f the Congo Forest Atlas (via internet) 
have also been initiated. 
While the creation o f institutions and the design and implementation o f legislation and action plans can only be a 
first step towards addressing deep-seated governance issues, the renewed commitment by the government to take 
decisive action i s equally important. This i s a long term process and results cannot be expected overnight. 
Continued support from development partners on all aspects o f governance i s crucial for full implementation o f 
this agenda. The CPS, therefore, commits the Bank to continued engagement with government to ensure that the 
issues highlighted i n the 2009 diagnostic w i l l be addressed i n a way as to enhance the quality o f public services. 

d) Improving Human Capital and Strengthening Public Institutions 
3 5 . 
Education. The many years o f civil conflict ravaged Congo’s education system, and 
severely eroded the country’s s k i l l s base. However, efforts over the past years have led to some 
gains in enrolment and completion levels, which had suffered during the war. Completion rates 
for primary education reached 73 percent in 2007 , compared to 62 percent in 2003 . For further 
gains, key s truc tura l issues w i l l have to be addressed, such as inadequate and in some cases 
unqualified teaching s t a f f (commonly referred to as “be‘ne‘volesyy), especially in remote, 
underserved areas (redeployment o f teachers on government payroll to remote and underserved 
communities remains a challenge); poor quality o f education and uneven access, especially by the 
poor who cannot ra ise the required fees; inadequate funding, etc. Schooling for minorities, such 

14 

as the pygmies, remains also a challenge. In addition, the new economic d irec t ion that the country 
i s char t ing out w i l l require suitably adapted s k i l l s , especially at the ter t iary l e v e l . Yet, the 
a l loca t ion o f resources among the education sub-sectors i s no t w e l l a l igned with the country’s 
strategic pr ior i t ies . T o meet this challenge, the Government has adopted a strategy that aims at 
imp rov ing qua l i ty and access by strengthening the education sector’s ins t i tu t iona l capacity and 
imp rov ing school infrastructure and supplies. 
3 6. 
Health. The health care system, whose outcomes remain disproportionately inferior 
to the country’s resources, faces similar challenges, name ly : insu f f ic ien t human resources, 
poor infrastructure and lack o f basic maintenance, deficiencies in the d is t r ibu t ion o f medicines to 
health centers wh ich leads to frequent shortages, limited access o f vulnerable groups t o qua l i ty 
services especially in remote areas, c r i t ica l hygiene and sanitation cond i t ions o f the population, 
and weak mon i to r ing and evaluation. Reproductive hea l th in Congo i s poor as re f lec ted in the 
high maternal mo r ta l i t y ratio, (estimated at 740 maternal deaths per 100,000 l i v e births in 2007). 
The ma in causes o f maternal deaths are: induced abortions (41%), b leed ing du r ing de l ivery 
(40%), post-abortion 
in fec t ion ( 18.8%), post-partum hemorrhage ( 12.7%), hypertension- 
eclampsia (1 1%) and, dystocia with their un toward consequences ( inc lud ing uterine rupture, 
vesico-vaginal fistulas, ascending infections), I-IIV/AIDS 
(6%), ma lar ia and other (20%). In fan t 
mo r ta l i ty increased f r om 67 deaths per 1,000 l i v e births in 1990, to 79 in 2007. S im i lar ly , under- 
f i ve mo r ta l i ty increased f r om 103 to 126 per 1,000 l ive b ir ths over the same per iod . The lead ing 
causes o f ch i ld mo r ta l i ty have remained unchanged fo r years, namely: ma lar ia (31%), diarrhea 
(26%), acute respiratory in fec t ions (14%), non-ma lar ia l anemia (6%), and AIDS (7%). As a 
result, Congo i s unlikely to reach the targets o f the Millennium Deve lopmen t Goals. The 
Government’s Na t iona l P lan fo r Sanitary Development (2007 - 201 1) prov ides a sound platform 
fo r the authorities and the ir partners to tackle these challenges in a coordinated fashion. 
37. 
Pub l ic Ins t i tu t ions . As a post-conflict country, Congo continues to suffer from weak 
public institutions and lack o f capacity. G iven t h e country’s amb i t ions to trans form i t s 
economy, the development o f a modem and e f f ic ien t pub l ic sector i s cr i t ica l , par t icu lar ly in the 
area governance as stated earlier. 
These institutional weaknesses are also present among public utilities, e.g. for water 
and electricity. The water utility i s in dire need o f re form . I t s d is t r ibu t ion ne two rk has been 
severely underfunded over the past decades and requires immed ia te attention. Yet, this i s a 
c r i t ica l sector fo r reduc ing pover ty and a t ta in ing millennium development goals. O n l y 45 percent 
o f the country’s urban popu la t ion and 12 percent o f i t s ru ra l popu la t ion have access to re l iab le and 
potable water. S im i la r ly , the e lec tr ic i ty sector i s beset by weak p lann ing and poor managerial and 
f inanc ia l performance, w h i c h has led to delays in needed investments. As a consequence, 
e lec tr ic i ty supply t o urban areas i s insu f f ic ien t and highly unreliable, with access t o e lec tr ic i ty in 
ru ra l areas being ex treme ly limited. 

3 8 . 

B. 

GOVERNMENT’S STRATEGIC PRIORITIES AND PROGRAMS 

39. 
I n April 2008, the Government adopted Congo’s full PRSP, after an extensive 
consultation process and validation by civil society and Parliament. The ove ra l l v is ion o f the 
PRSP i s t o build a d ive rs i f ied economy, p r ima r i ly building on i t s strengths by deve lop ing transit 
services to ne ighbo r ing countries and p romo t ing deeper reg iona l integration, and to reduce 
pover ty by a h a l f by 2015. The f i v e p i l la rs o f the PRSP, w h i c h are consistent with the ma in 
challenges identified in the pover ty diagnostic, are: (i) imp rov ing governance and conso l ida t ing 
peace and security; (ii) p romo t ing g row th and macroeconomic s tab i l i ty ; (iii) enhancing access to 

15 

basic social services; (iv) improving the social environment and integration o f vulnerable groups; 
and (v) combating HIV/AIDS. 
40. 
While the PRSP provides a sound basis f o r reform efforts, i t needs to be rendered 
more operational. This w i l l require developing detailed sector strategies w i th detailed cost 
estimates, a solid Monitoring & Evaluation framework, and an MTEF to ensure that PRSP 
priorities are translated into budgetary allocations. Sector-wide strategies exist only in a few 
sectors so far (education, health, and transport). I t i s envisaged to move towards developing 
program budgets (sector MTEFs) in these “pioneer sectors”, while gradually developing 
strategies in other priority sectors. The preparation o f an overall MTEF i s already underway. The 
strategies and the PRSP w i l l have to be refined through enhancing the poverty diagnosis, in 
particular w i th respect to assessing the impact o f Government policies on the poor. Results from a 
new household expenditure survey are expected in 2010. The new data w i l l be more robust than 
the 2005 data, thus helping to get a better understanding o f the composition and distribution o f 
vulnerable groups in Congo across gender, ethnicity, geography, etc. This i s essen t ia l for better 
targeting o f Government policies and programs. 
41. 
Over the past year, the Government has made progress in the implementation o f its 
PRSP. On the governance and peace consolidation agenda, it has reached an agreement w i th the 
las t group o f rebe ls and initiated the demobilization o f former combatants, paving the way for a 
resumption o f economic activities in the Pool area near Brazzaville. I t has adopted an action plan 
for improving public f inanc ia l management and started to implement it. I t established an An t i - 
Corruption Observatory and taken steps to meet the floating Completion Point triggers for the 
enhanced HIPC initiative (see Box 5). 
42. 
Under the second pillar, promoting growth and macroeconomic stability, the 
Government has taken a number o f initiatives. W i th assistance from external partners, it has 
launched a major infrastructure building program to alleviate severe constraints to economic 
growth. I n the powe r sector, a new 450 megawatt gas-fired power plant in Pointe-Noire i s under 
construction by EN1 Petroleum, for a total estimated cost o f US$400 million; a 120 megawatt 
hydro power plant i s under construction at Imboulou on the Lefini River, w i th support from 
China; and a 32.5 megawatt thermal plant in Brazzaville has been completed. In the transport 
sector, the construction o f the 600 km road between Pointe-Noire and Brazzaville i s underway 
w i th assistance from China. Consultants have been hired to search for a concessionaire for CFCO, 
the state-owned railway company. The container port o f Pointe-Noire has been put under private 
management and an agreement has been reached w i th the French Agency for Development 
(Agence Frunqa ise de De‘veloppernent - A F D ) , the European Investment Bank, and the Bank for 
Central African States (Bunque des Etuts de 1’Afrique Centru le - BEAC ) for the financing o f the 
modernization program for the port. In order to maximize and sustain the benefits from these 
investments, i t i s c r i t i c a l to focus on improving services and ensuring effective management, 
especially maintenance. 
43, 
The Government i s taking steps to improve the business climate, including ensuring 
effective implementation o f OHADA business laws, which are common to Francophone 
countries, creating a one-stop window for establishing a business and bringing the custom code 
into line w i th international standards. I t i s working on the preparation o f a rural development 
s tra tegy . Much more remains to be done, however, to remove obstacles to private sector 
investment, which are s t i l l formidable. This includes implementing existing commitments (such 
as those under OHADA ) and making institutions (such as the one-stop shop) more fu l ly 
operational. 
44. 
Progress i s also being made under the tw o pillars involving the delivery o f basic 
services to the population and the fight against H IV /A IDS . Education indicators are

Box 5: H IPC Completion Point Status 
Congo reached the H IPC Decision Point in March 2006. Total estimated H IPC r e l i e f i s US$ 1,679 m i l l i o n 
(end-2004 Net Present Value terms) . Congo has already benefited substantially from interim debt r e l i e f 
granted under the H IPC process, most notably through two substantial agreements w i t h the London Club o f 
private creditors in November 2007 (cancellation o f U S $ l . 6 b i l l i o n in outstanding debt) and w i th Paris 
Club in December 2008 (cancellation o f US$805 m i l l i o n and rescheduling o f US $ l 5 5 m i l l ion) . 
S ince the creation o f a new coordination s t ruc tu re in November 2007, significant progress was made on 
several triggers (adoption o f the PRSP, the return to macroeconomic stability, gradual increase in pro-poor 
orientation o f the budget, and implementation o f structural reforms in telecom, forestry and education). 
Congo i s expected to reach the H IPC Completion Point in late 2009 i f progress i s made on the remaining 
agenda: 
Procurement Reform: After a long impasse, progress has recently been made on dra f t ing a Procurement 
Code and related texts in l i n e w i t h international good practice, wh ich are expected to be adopted soon. 
Relevant institutions must now be established. I t i s expected that implementation - wh ich i s necessary to 
satisfy the trigger - can on ly begin around November 2009. 
O i l sector: The 2005 audit report revealed a number o f important shortcomings in the presentation o f SNPC 
accounts. F ina l reports on both the 2006 and 2007 audits a re expected in June 2009 and w i l l determine 
whether this trigger can be met without the preparation o f an audit report for 2008. An agreement on the 
contents o f the o i l marketing re form p lan i s w i th in reach after months o f intensive dialogue between the 
authorities and the Bank and the IMF. This p lan should introduce measures to bring marketing practices to 
minimum standards o f transparency and effectiveness. 
Governance: An agreement in pr inc ip le on both the anti-corruption and governance action p lan and the 
anti-corruption law has been reached. B o t h documents are l ike ly to be adopted b y Government soon, and 
the L aw would then be sent to Parliament for adoption. 
Public Investment Management: A sound Ac t ion Plan on Public Investment Management was adopted in 
January 2009 and a set o f indicators to monitor implementation was elaborated w i t h support o f the Bank. 
The plan focuses in particular on enhancing the process o f preparing, appraising and se lec t ing new projects, 
as we l l as improv ing effectiveness and transparency in executing the public investment budget. 

IV. WORLD BANK GROUP PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 

PERFORMANCE OF THE FY07-FY09 INTER IM STRATEGY NOTE AND LESSONS 

A. 
LEARNED 

45 . 

The FY07-09 Interim Strategy Note, which was reviewed by the Board i n July 2007, 
focused on tw o priority areas: (i) scaling up the governance agenda, and (ii) creating a 

foundation f o r equitable growth. T h e Bank’s suppor t t o the governance agenda i n c l u d e d 
s treng then ing p u b l i c f i n a n c i a l a n d inves tmen t management, p u b l i c procuremen t , and o i l sector 
management, as w e l l as the demand side o f governance (e.g. se t t ing up a n a n t i - c o r r u p t i o n

observatory). The Bank’s support to the growth agenda included assisting Government in 
elaborating its PRSP, providing analytical inputs, and implementing the ongoing portfolio. An 
effort was made to engage in a more substantial dialogue on growth, through a high-level 
government seminar held in June 2008, and the subsequent initiation o f analytical work on: the 
corridor approach to spatial infrastructure development; private sector constraints and 
opportunities; and public expenditure. 
46. 
The outcome indicators in the ISN were not realistic in view o f the short period 
covered by the I S N and IDA ’S limited resources fo r Congo. Annex 3 provides a detailed 
assessment o f progress against these indicators. The I S N set forth 12 outcomes on transparency 
and public finance management, basic social services, and ru ra l growth. Most o f these outcomes 
are unlikely to be achieved by the end o f the ISN period in June 2009 . I n the governance area, i t 
takes time to change deeply entrenched habits. Progress i s being made, but a l l major activities 
under the ac t ion plan supported by the ongoing Transparency and Governance Capacity Building 
Project are facing delays. I n the soc ia l sectors, the outcome indicators, as selected in the ISN, 
were not consistent with the result frameworks for the ongoing projects. I n the rura l growth area, 
implementation o f the Bank-supported project was delayed. In any event, it would have been 
impossible for the project to deliver results as expected within the I S N timeframe. 
I S N implementation provides important lessons fo r the preparation o f the CPS. 
These lessons focus in particular on how to make a difference in spite o f a limited IDA financing 
envelope, and how to engage most effectively in a difficult governance environment. 
Realistic expectations. Expectations o f impact o f Bank support should be commensurate 
with the limited amount o f assistance provided. Significant time i s required fo r reaching a 
consensus on sensitive reforms after decades o f economic mismanagement and internal 
conflicts, and the weak capacity in government administration. 
Strategic use o f Bank resources. IDA ’S envelope o f about US$20 million per year pales 
in comparison to Government’s investment budget o f about US$1 billion per year. I n 
order to have a r e a l impact on growth, poverty and social outcomes, Bank support w i l l 
need to be used in a more strategic manner whereby lending and non-lending activities 
w i l l particularly have to focus on spurring efficiency in, and more strategic choice of, 
largely Government financed programs. Similarly, IDA ’S limited funds w i l l have to be 
leveraged with significant co-financing from the Government. Finally, in light o f IDA ’S 
limited administrative budget for activities in Congo, some o f the Bank’s support could 
be provided (at least partially) in the form o f fee-based s ew i c e s fo r selected activities. 
Tackle governance from different angles. The Bank should complement i t s direct support 
to governance reforms with a more substantive engagement on helping accelerate growth, 
which i s a critical concern o f the Government. As the positive response o f the 
Government to the high-level seminar on growth and the policy dialogue on transport 
corridors have shown, this i s important to demonstrate to the authorities the value-added 
o f engaging with the Bank. A second and related lesson was that it would be more 
effective to treat governance as a cross-cutting issue. Enhancing transparency and 
governance standards should not be treated in isolation, but as c r i t ica l factors in 
improving effectiveness in service delivery or infrastructure upgrading. Finally, the I S N 
experience showed that there i s a need to engage not only with the Government, but also 
with the demand-side o f governance to bring about lasting change in these areas. This i s 
particularly t rue in Congo’s post-conflict context, where formal and informal institutions 
in- and outside o f government are s t i l l weak in capacity. The positive effect o f Bank 
support to publication o f o i l revenue data or the creation o f an Anti-corruption 
Observatory are a case in point.

B. 

PROPOSED COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 

4 8 . 

i) CPS Objective and Strategic Approach 
The main objective o f this results-based CPS i s to make a critical contribution to 
promoting broad-based economic growth and improving social outcomes. The proposed CPS 
i s fu l l y in l i n e w i th PRSP priorities, especially those in pillars 2 (promoting growth and 
macroeconomic stability) and 3 (enhancing access to basic social services). The selection of the 
principal themes, the expected outcomes, and the lending and non-lending program o f the CPS 
were a l l guided by intensive consultations w i th main stakeholders and by the lessons learned in 
implementing the ISN. 
4 9 . 
The underlying approach o f the strategy i s to provide critical support to Congo for 
getting the highest possible benefit from its current e f fo r t s to improve the reach and quality 
o f its infrastructure and basic services. The CPS recognizes IDA ’s limited funding envelope in 
comparison to the relatively large resources available to the Government to implement i t s priority 
programs. Therefore, i t focuses on helping the Government improve prioritization and effective 
implementation, as we l l as subsequent management, o f i t s ambitious infrastructure investment 
program, and supports i t s efforts to enhance basic service delivery. Besides playing this strategic 
role, the Bank w i l l seek to leverage i t s small envelope in each new project w i th significant 
amounts from the Government in order to obtain the desired c r i t i c a l mass. This i s consistent w i th 
the Bank’s evolving role, from that o f “financier”, to that o f “catalyst” for change. 
5 0 . 
I n addition, a particular emphasis will be put on building coalitions with other 
partners fo r advancing critical sectoral and cross-sectoral reforms. In order to improve aid 
efficiency, new financing under the CPS w i l l be structured so as to be complementary and 
synergistic to that provided by other development partners. For this purpose, these partners have 
been very closely consulted during CPS preparation. 
5 1. Within the World Bank Group, this strategy was prepared in close collaboration 
with I FC . Although the IFC i s only now beginning to reengage in the country (and thus a j o i n t 
Strategy wasn’t possible at this time), areas o f potential synergy were identified during the CPS’ 
preparation. These include Small and Medium Enterprise Development, and Agribusiness 
Development (see Annex 4 for more on IFC’s areas on interest). This ongoing collaboration w i l l 
be intensified during the implementation phase o f the CPS over these and other areas to maximize 
synergy. 

52 . 
Finally, the proposed CPS program has been designed with a view to helping 
mitigate the effects o f the global financial c r i s i s on the Congolese economy. IDA ’ s limited 
funding envelope for Congo o f approximately US$20 m i l l ion per year would not allow for 
providing significant amounts o f resources for financing f i s c a l gaps or stimulus programs in the 
event of a deeper and more protracted global financial c r i s i s . Fortunately, in recent years, Congo 
has accumulated significant reserves in i t s stabilization account from o i l revenues. In addition, on 
average, from 2009 to 2014, annual o i l revenues are conservatively projected at FCFA 3,385 
b i l l ion (about US$6.8 billion) although these might decline should the global economic situation 
worsen. As indicated ear l ier , this should allow the Government to continue i t s current public 
investment outlays o f about FCFA 600 b i l l ion (US$1.2 billion) per year. In view o f the above, the 
CPS’ strategic approach to mitigating the risks o f an aggravation o f the e f f e c t s o f the global crisis 
on the Congolese economy i s to support the Government in effectively managing i t s own 
resources by strengthening fiscal management as we l l as increasing spending efficiency. A t the 
same time, the CPS program would help the Government respond to the ever more pressing need 
for accelerating structural reforms, particularly those aimed at unshackling the Congolese 

19 

economy from heavy dependence on o i l by promoting a robust, highly diversified economy that 
i s more r e s i l i e n t to such external shocks. 

5 3 . 

ii) M a in Themes o f the CPS 
The Bank’s support to the Government’s efforts will be organized around tw o main 
pillars. These are: (i) support to diversification and growth and (ii) poverty reduction through 
improved basic service delivery. To ensure effective implementation in both priority areas, the 
CPS w i l l also support governance and institutional capacity building as a cross-cutting theme. 
These themes were arrived at after a ser ies o f extensive consultations w i th the Congolese c i v i l 
society, private sector, Parliament, Government (both local and national), and Congo’s 
international development partners (see Box 6 on Consultations). 

0 D i ve rs i fv im the economy to suur broad-based mowth. This w i l l include supporting the 
country’s reform efforts in three key areas: (i) more effectively managing o i l revenues in 
the face o f high price volatility and possible decline o f rese rves in the long-term, and 
using these resources to promote the diversification agenda and improve the se rv ices 
provided by key infrastructure; (ii) adopting and initiating implementation o f a strategy 
for developing growth corridors that would improve exploitation o f natural resources, 
l ink ing production w i th markets, and regional integration - including restoring Congo’s 
traditional transit services industry; and (iii) developing, and implementing a strategy for 
removing key obstacles to private sector development, and for promoting small and 
medium-term en terpr ises (including agro-business).

Improving public service delivery for the people o f Congo. particularly the most 
vulnerable ~TOUDS . This entails improving basic services, especially health and education, 
through we l l focused programs and their e f f i c i e n t implementation. 
54 . 
Support in these t w o areas will be complemented by continued focus on improving 
governance and strengthening institutional capacity. Support to different aspects o f ongoing 
reforms on strengthening transparency, accountability and 
institutional capacity 
in the 
management o f public resources remains a major priority for the Bank. The Bank w i l l play a 
c r i t i c a l role in facilitating the implementation o f recently adopted new legislation and action plans 
to address weaknesses i n the governance system, including on o i l marketing, governance and 
anti-corruption, public investment management and procurement. In dealing w i th these issues, the 
Bank w i l l continue to support both the supply side and the demand side o f governance. 
Improving governance and institutional capacity will not be treated in isolation, but 
rather, i t will be mainstreamed into sectoral interventions. Consequently, a l l existing projects 
w i l l be reviewed, and i f necessary retrofitted, in order to ensure that relevant governance issues 
are adequately addressed. Similarly, a l l new activities w i l l incorporate relevant governance issues 
as well. 
In addition, this governance agenda w i l l be f i rm ly anchored in a thorough political 
economy analysis to be conducted during the preparation o f each operation. 

5 5 .

Box 6: Consultations for the Country Partnership Strategy 

Extensive consultations w i th a l l stakeholders took place for the preparation o f the CPS in three steps. First, 
a high-level government seminar was held in June 2008 on growth, in which the contours o f f u t u r e Bank 
support were traced out, and major analytical work was initiated on the corridor approach to spatial 
infrastructure development, the assessment o f private sector constraints and opportunities, and initiation o f 
the Public Expenditure Review. 
I n December 2008, the Bank team organized meetings w i th cabinet members, technical committees, both 
houses o f Parliament, the private sector, farmer organizations, c iv i l society organizations, academia and 
external partners. Meetings took place in Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire. During these discussions the Bank 
team tested the new approach proposed in this CPS, namely the change o f the Bank r o l e f iom a financier to 
a catalyst for change. The main themes o f the CPS were extensively discussed. 
In Ap r i l 2009 another round o f consultations took place. The objective o f these consultations was t o reach a 
consensus with the Bank’s partners (government, private sector, c iv i l society organizations, academia and 
external partners) on the r e s u l t s matrix and proposed instruments. A l l interlocutors welcomed the proposed 
activities and outcomes. They reviewed carefully the outcome and output indicators and found them to be 
both ambitious and realistic. They agreed that i f these indicators were met, Congo would move decisively 
on t h e path to sustainable and we l l diversified growth. 

iii) Outcomes and Instruments 

56. 

The Bank’s support to the above themes would result in a series o f efficiency and 

growth outcomes. Under the economic d ivers i f ica t ion and g row th agenda: (i) the management 
o f o i l revenue and pub l ic expenditure wou ld be made more effective; (ii) the produc t ion and 
p roduc t iv i ty o f commerc ia l agr icu l ture wou ld be enhanced; (iii) too ls fo r imp roved forestry 
management wou ld be put in place; (iv) the founda t ion fo r the g row th o f micro, small, and 
medium en te rp r ises w o u l d be laid; (v) the services f r om Government’s ongo ing o r planned 
infrastructure program w o u l d improve; and (v i) Congo w o u l d lay the founda t ion fo r increasing i t s 
market share in reg iona l trans i t services. Under the basic service de l ive ry agenda, the p r inc ipa l 
outcome wou ld be the improvemen t in these services, especially emanating f r om increased 
e f f ic iency and transparency o f pub l ic spending. The f o l l ow i n g i s a presentation o f these expected 
outcomes together with the proposed corresponding CPS interventions (projects, ana ly t ica l and 
advisory services) that are needed fo r a t ta in ing these resu l ts . 

5 7 . 

CPS outcome 1.1: The management of o i l revenue andpub l ic expenditure is more effective 
Support f o r improvements in o i l revenue and public expenditure management will 
be provided through multiple channels, 
including the ongoing Transparency and 
Governance Capacity Building Project and its proposed follow-up operation, the ongoing 
Public Expenditure Review (PER), and analytical and advisory work on o i l revenue 

management. I n i t i a l progress made on o i l revenue and pub l ic expenditure management during 
the ISN pe r iod w i l l be consolidated and amp l i f ied during the CPS period. The findings o f the 
ongo ing PER and the planned O i l Revenue Management Review w i l l strengthen the ana ly t ica l 
founda t ion fo r imp rov ing the mob i l iza t ion and use o f o i l revenues. Based on these findings, the 
Bank, in close co l labora t ion with the IMF, w i l l help the Government rev ise i t s f isca l strategy with 
a v iew to addressing vo la t i l i ty and l o n g t e r m decline o f o i l revenues, as w e l l as enhance spending 
efficiency. These findings w i l l also influence the preparation o f the MTEF. The Bank ’s ongo ing 
capacity building support w i l l continue and, together with techn ica l assistance f r om the AFDB 
and the EU, should p lay an instrumental ro le in advancing pub l ic f inanc ia l management and 
budget management reforms, especially with respect to : (i) implementing the new procurement 

21 

system, (ii) preparing MTEFs at the central level and in key sectors; (iii) implementing the action 
plan for public investment management; and (iv) implementing a new automated and simplified 
system o f expenditure management. Progress w i l l be measured through: the reduction o f the non- 
o i l primary de f ic i t as a share o f non-oil GDP, which w i l l record progress made by the 
Government in reducing the budget’s dependency on o i l revenues; the progressive shift from 
direct contracting to competitive procurement; and the increased use o f regular budget procedures 
supported by a new automated and simplified expenditure chain. 

CPS Outcome 1.2: Agricultural production and productivity in high potential zones i s 
enhanced 
5 8 . 
The ongoing Agricultural Development and Ru ra l Roads Rehabilitation Project i s 
the main instrument for achieving this outcome. The Bank’s support in the agr icu l ture sector 
targets both small holder farming and small-medium sca le agro-industries. Support to small- 
holders aims at: (i) improving domestic agricultural marketing (made possible, in part, by the 
planned rural road rehabilitation); (ii) promoting on-farm and off-farm activities (through the 
provision o f improved technology and delivery o f extension services); and (iii) strengthening 
farmers’ organizations to facilitate forward and backward linkages w i th agro-industries. For agro- 
industries, the support aims at improving the incentive framework for private investments in on- 
farm and off-farm activities. In addition, the Bank w i l l assist the government in: (i) formulating a 
national investment program covering extension and adaptive research, agricultural marketing, 
on-farm and off-farm investments, and support to fa rme rs ’ organizations; (ii) implementing 
extensive consultation process w i th potential investors in ago-industries, w i th a view to 
identifying and implementing a menu o f priority measures to address bottlenecks against the 
development o f ago-industries; and (iii) developing an MTEF for agr icu l ture covering activities 
underpinned by the strategic elements referred to above. These efforts w i l l be closely coordinated 
w i th the two agricultural projects funded by the International Fund for Agricultural Development. 
Progress w i l l be monitored through, among other things: the reduction in ru ra l transportation 
costs and the increase in average yields for key products in target areas. 

CPS Outcome 1.3: Tools for improved forestry management put in place 
59 . 
This outcome will be made possible by the ongoing dialogue on forestry reforms in 
the context o f HIPC, which will be consolidated under the proposed Forestry and 
Environment Project. Congo has made some progress in this sphere, including the integration o f 
international independent observers into forest control operations, and the publication o f the 
Congo Forest Atlas on the in terne t . Major reforms are under preparation, including: preparing 
new gazetting and degazetting regulations that take into account forest and indigenous people 
rights; a new forest concession award regulation; a new forest taxation system and a collaborative 
recovery system between Ministry o f Forests and Environment; a new Environmental Impact 
Assessment regulation; and a reorganization o f key monitoring, 
law enforcement, and 
participatory management functions in M i n i s t r i e s in charge o f Forests and the Environment. 
Progress w i l l measured by the adoption and implementation o f these texts. In addition, Congo has 
recently been selected to be part o f the Readiness Mechanism o f the Forest Carbon Partnership 
Facility. The mechanism helps tropical countries develop a strategy to reduce deforestation and 
forest degradation and prepare themselves for a potential market instrument o f positive incentives 
stipulated under the program. Congo expects to receive a preparatory grant o f US$200,000 from 
the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility to develop a Readiness Plan and an additional grant o f up 
to US $ 3 . 4 m i l l ion to execute the plan once approved. 

22 

CPS Outcome 1.4: The foundation for the growth of micro, small, and medium enterprises is 
la id 
60. 
This outcome will be achieved through the proposed Economic Diversification 
Support Project, working very closely with IFC , EU, IMF, the Public-Private Infrastructure 
Advisory Facility, and other partners. Based on the findings o f the recently completed 
investment climate survey, this project w i l l support a number o f priority actions aimed a t 
improving MSME access to financial and non-financial services, as we l l as improving the 
investment climate in such areas as business registration, taxation, public-private partnership 
frameworks, and public-private sector dialogue. This w i l l be complemented by IFC’s plans to 
improve access o f small and medium entrepreneurs to credit, and those o f the recently approved 
regional financial sector project to strengthen the financial sector in CEMAC member countries, 
which should create a favorable environment for enhanced cred i t to the private sector. 
Implementation o f these activities w i l l be closely coordinated w i th the I M F (tax reform) and the 
EU (economic governance). The analytical work on Growth and Employment which i s proposed 
under the CPS w i l l complement this effort, especially by helping the Government devise a growth 
strategy that leads to the creation o f substantial employment in the formal non-oil sectors. 
Progress toward achieving this outcome w i l l be monitored through, among other things: the time 
required for registering a business, banks’ compliance w i th regionally agreed f inanc ia l norms, 
and the effective tax ra te for MSMEs. 

Outcome 1.5: The services from Government’s ongoing/planned infrastructure program are 
improved 
61. 
This will be achieved through management and regulatory reform programs 
supported under various projects. Reforms in the energy sector and improvements in the 
planning and management o f transport infrastructure w i l l be supported by the proposed Economic 
Diversification Support Project; reforms in the water sector by the proposed Urban and Water 
Project; and reforms in the telecommunications sector by proposed Regional Telecommunications 
Project. Progress toward achieving this outcome w i l l be monitored through improvements in, 
among other things: the telecommunication sector regulatory framework, the management o f the 
e l e c t r i c power utility, and annual road maintenance. 

Outcome 1.6: Congo lays the foundation for increasing its market shale in regional transit 
services 
62. 
The main vehicle 
fo r achieving this outcome 
i s the proposed Economic 
Diversification Support Project, in conjunction with other partners. The proposed project, 
which w i l l focus on investment planning for, and improvements in service delivery along, the 
principal transport corridors, w i l l complement the ongoing and planned investments financed by 
the French Development Agency (AFD), the European Investment Bank, the Development Bank 
for Central African States, the Chinese Government, and the Government’s own resources in 
strategic areas like the port o f Pointe-Noire and road infrastructure. The project w i l l also help 
Government manage the concession o f the Pointe-Noire - Brazzaville railway (CFCO), once this 
concession i s put in place w i th the ongoing support from the EU. I t w i l l work closely w i th the 
AfDB, the EU and AFD on laying the foundation for enhancing trade between Brazzaville and 
Kinshasa and up river from Brazzaville. The ongoing Bank-financed Transport Corridor Study i s 
expected to provide a road map for enhancing Congo’s transit role. Whereas the r e s u l t s from 
these actions are long term, and depend upon several other factors (such as the pace o f 
investments underway), measures o f progress during t h e CPS period w i l l include adoption o f the 
various strategies and regulations, and investment programs emanating from this analysis. 

23 

Outcome 2.1: The delivery of basic services is improved 
63. 

This outcome i s expected to be achieved with the support from ongoing operations 
andlor additional financing in education, health, and H IV IA IDS , a new urban and water 
project, and the public expenditure review. The education project w i l l finance enhancement o f 
the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Education, rehabilitation o f school infrastructure, 
improvement of education quality (such as teacher training, scholastic materials, and curriculum 
improvement), and delivery of formal and non-formal education services to out-of-school youth 
and pygmies. The objectives of the Health Project are to strengthen Congo’s health system in 
order to combat more effectively major communicable diseases and improve access to quality 
services for women, children and other vulnerable groups through strengthening the 
organizational, managerial and fiduciary capabilities o f the Ministry o f Health, rehabilitating and 
equipping health care fac i l i t ies , and improving access to quality essential health care services. 
Ma te rna l and child health outcomes and malaria w i l l receive special attention in this project. This 
w i l l be carried out in partnership with the United Nations Fund for Population Activities which i s 
supporting the implementation o f the national road map to accelerate the reduction o f maternal, 
neonatal and infant morbidity and mortality through capacity building o f health centers and 
communities in order to ensure the availability o f family planning services. The HN /A IDS will, 
inter alia: (a) improve diagnosis and treatment; (b) promote condom use and voluntary testing, 
(c) disseminate information for behavior change; (d) improve the quality o f blood transfusion; (d) 
improve counseling; (e) help the adoption o f a legal framework for protecting victims o f 
HN /A IDS and sexual violence; and ( f ) improve bio-medical waste management. The Urban and 
Water In fras truc ture Project w i l l improve the management o f the water utility and the delivery o f 
basic urban infrastructure services. Providing reliable and clean water w i l l help improve health 
outcomes, as well as address a major constraint to private sector development. The proposed 
MTEF for Health and Education (to be made possible by the ongoing public expenditure review), 
and the proposed performance-based system fo r human resources management i n the two sectors 
i s expected to increase the quality and efficiency o f public expenditure in these sectors. Progress 
toward achieving this outcome w i l l be monitored through such indicators as improvements in the 
completion rate and the girl-boy ratio, a reduction in the under-five mortality rate, and the 
containment o f the spread o f HN /A IDS , especially among the youths, sexually active population 
segments, and from mother to child. 

iv) Results-Based Monitoring & Evaluation 
64. 
A major challenge f o r Congo i s to ensure that its policies and budget allocations are 
informed by a sound monitoring and evaluation system that promotes public accountability. 
Capacity in results-based monitoring and evaluation, and information management i s limited. 
Monitoring and evaluation i s currently narrowly focused on administrative process o f 
expenditures and activities rather than on outcomes, impacts, and goals. Although the PRSP was 
based on a sound poverty diagnosis, underlying data i s still weak and requires updating. 
Institutional capacity i s weak and respective roles o f different institutions in monitoring and 
evaluation unclear, such as between the National Center for Statistics and Economic Analysis and 
the proposed poverty observatory, or between central bodies and Studies and Planning 
Directorates in sector ministries. 
65 . 
The PRSP provides a good opportunity to strengthen monitoring and evaluation 
capacity and to develop a comprehensive yet simple mechanism to monitor and evaluate 
government action. As part o f PRSP preparation, a serious effort was made to put i n place an 
institutional s truc ture for measuring PRSP implementation in a coordinated way across 
government. Going ahead, this structure w i l l have to be progressively strengthened, with a view 
to producing reliable findings on how public actions (public spending in particular) re la te to 

24 

0 

6 6 . 

tangible r e s u l t s on the ground. In this regard, the Bank i s supporting the Government in the 
following priority actions to enhance monitoring and evaluation: 
Updating and enhancing the quality o f poverty and social data by completing the census 
and a new se r ies o f (improved) household and specialized surveys (on which the 
Government i s supported by AfDB, AFRISTAT, and the Wo r ld Bank); 
Improving coordination on monitoring and evaluating PRSP implementation, in 
particular by enhancing participation o f sector ministries and clarification o f the roles o f 
institutions involved in data collection and analysis; 
Strengthening the PRSP's resu l ts framework, by narrowing i t s scope to essential 
indicators, and better defining them by adding baselines and measurable targets; and 
Supporting the development o f a new national statistical development strategy for the 
monitoring o f the PRSP and sector MTEFs. 
Status o f the statistical system. The Congolese s ta t is t ica l system, which was supposed 
to be guided in i t s development by the Multi-Year Plan for Statistical Development ( P l a n 
P lu r iannue l de De'veloppement de la Statistique) for the period 2005 -9 , i s currently insufficiently 
strong for monitoring the PRSP and sector MTEFs. The heavy focus in the PRSP on survey data, 
even when routine administrative data should provide the information, shows that the system i s 
not producing the information expected from a fully-functional system. The health project, 
building upon the work o f the H IV /A IDS project, i s working in the area o f a health management 
information system, but many areas a re s t i l l weak. The statistical development plan identified a 
number o f areas for action, many o f which do not appear to have been followed, including the 
passage o f the statistical law. 
Monitoring CPS implementation. The CPS Results Framework establishes the resu l ts 
chain for the Bank's program w i th a focus on outputs and outcomes, linked to longer-term 
country outcomes. The CPS has identified a se t o f outcome and output indicators to measure 
progress (columns 3 and 4 o f the matrices in Annex 1). In most cases, these indicators are 
quantified w i th expected target ranges, and in some cases, more qualitative information needs to 
be derived. Where there a re gaps in information, the Bank w i l l work w i th the Government in 
identifying spec i f ic measurements o f outcomes during the f i r s t year o f the CPS. The outcome 
indicators have been selected taking into account the limited capacity for monitoring and 
evaluation. Indicators in the areas o f agriculture development and social services are expected to 
be monitored under the relevant sector projects. 
Implementation Progress o f the CPS will also be monitored in annual Country 
Portfolio Performance Reviews, as well as a CPS mid-term review which i s planned fo r 
early 2011. I t w i l l assess progress in achieving the main CPS outcomes and outputs, dealing w i th 
risks and problems that might hinder achievement o f t h e outcomes, and identifying systemic 
issues that may affect the portfolio. I t w i l l review problems encountered in the collection and 
analysis of data to measure progress and recommend corrective actions. The Bank w i l l continue 
to provide support and advice in the preparation o f the PRSP progress reports. 

67.

v) Funding 

6 9 . 

The World Bank w i l l support the above program through i t s existing portfolio, new 
financing, and analytical and advisory services, as summarized below. I t should be emphasized 
that'substantial co-financing w i l l be provided by the Government. 

25 

a) Existing portfolio 
70. 
The current World Bank-financed project portfolio consists o f five country-level 
operations and one regional project, w i th an undisbursed balance o f US$72 m i l l ion (excluding the 
regional project). This amount i s expected to be fully disbursed during the CPS period. These 
projects mostly address issues related to improving Government’s delivery o f basic services, 
especially in health and education.

b) New Financing and Analytical & Advisory Services 
71. 
The first two years o f the CPS correspond to I D A 15, with the third year falling 
under I D A 16, for which the funding envelope i s yet to be determined. The CPS covers the 
period F Y 10-FY 12, which includes the last two years o f IDA15 period (FY 1 0-FY 1 1) and the f i r s t 
year o f IDA16 . The overall size o f the IDA envelope during the CPS period i s assumed to be 
about SDR33 million, which amounts to an average annual allocation o f about SDRl 1 m i l l ion . 
These estimates for FYlO-FY12 are indicative only and can change. Actual allocations in these 
years w i l l depend on: (i) total I D A resources available, (ii) Congo’s performance rating in the 
annual Country Policy and Institutional Assessment relative to other I D A countries, (iii) the 
performance and assistance terms o f other I D A borrowers; (iv) the t e rm s o f IDA ’S assistance to 
Congo (grants or credits), in particular a possible shift o f Congo from a grant-only to a mixed or 
credit-only IDA countries i n case i t s debt sustainability situation improves further, and (v) the 
number o f IDA -e l ig ib le countries. The indicative allocation for FY 12 assumes a similar level o f 
replenishment in IDA16 as in I D A 1 5 . 
72. 
The indicative I D A 15 and I D A 16 allocations are proposed t o be distributed as 
follows: US$15 m i l l ion has already been allocated to the Education Project Supplemental, U S $ 5 
m i l l ion to the H IV /A IDS supplemental, and US$2.7 m i l l ion to the CEh4AC Regional Institutions 
Support Project, leaving US$3 7.5 million. The proposed allocation o f this remaining amount i s 
presented in the table below. Although the level o f IDA 16 funding i s not known yet, preliminary 
discussions are ongoing on how to utilize these resources, especially during the third year o f this 
CPS, which coincides w i th the f i r s t year o f IDA 16. The Government has proposed a forestry 
operation and a supplemental to the Governance Project in this f i r s t year o f IDA 16, which i s 
consistent w i th diversifying the economy away from o i l dependence, and strengthening services 
delivery, principal themes o f this CPS.

vi) Congo’s Transition to Middle-Income Country Status 
73 . 
Congo’s elevated level o f budget resources and its high level o f GN I per capita 
create opportunities fo r redefining Bank’s relationship with the country. This includes 

exp lo r ing poss ib i l i t ies o f cost-sharing, as w e l l as prepar ing fo r the trans i t ion f r om IDA t o IBRD. 
Exp lo r ing t h e use o f fee-based services. The Bank i s expected to de l iver the bulk o f the 
proposed non- lend ing assistance through i t s ow n adm in is tra t ive resources. However , 
because o f the Bank ’s limited administrative budget, and in v i ew o f the country’s 
g row ing leve l o f resources, the Government has shown openness t o the no t ion o f fee- 
based Bank advice in certain situations. A l though discussions are s t i l l ongoing, such fee - 
based services cou ld be used on c lear ly de f ined tasks, especially those o f a short duration. 
The Government cou ld pa r t ia l ly fund this technical assistance, with the r e s t o f the funds 
com ing f r om the Bank budget as i s common elsewhere in the Bank . Care wou ld have to 
be taken t o safeguard f iduc ia ry and other standards, as we l l as protect the Bank’s 
independence and neu tra l i ty . 
Trans i t ion f r om IDA t o IBRD. Congo reached a GNI per capita o f US$1,970 in 2008, 
wh ich put the coun try above the income threshold fo r IDA lending fo r a second 

27 

consecutive year. I f i t remains above this threshold for a third year in 2009, IDA 
hardened terms w i l l be applied to Congo. Assuming that this income level i s maintained 
or increased further, Congo w i l l then progressively move towards graduating from IDA . 
The transition to IBRD is , however, a long process and w i l l require the country to meet 
stringent eligibility criteria, to ensure that it i s creditworthy. Debt sustainability i s an 
important element o f these cr i ter ia . As a H IPC country, Congo i s not eligible for IBRD at 
this time. After the HIPC process, and depending upon i t s economic performance, Congo 
w i l l be assessed to determine if it meets the eligibility cr i ter ia . The Bank w i l l also explore 
possibilities o f developing enclave projects for developing infrastructure under the IBRD 
window. 

C. 

PARTNERSHIPS 

75 . 

74 . 
Congo does not have many external partners. The most active partners are the French 
Agency fo r Development, the European Union, African Development Bank, and, most recently, 
the Chinese Government who, in 2006, entered into a fiamework agreement with the Government 
that i s worth up to US$I billion (see Table 7). The Bank has had extensive consultations with the 
traditional partners and intends to work closely with them for the delivery o f the assistance 
program. 
The Bank’s strategy f o r collaboration with the other partners i s based on the 
principal o f synergy and comparative advantage. For instance, the European Union i s taking 
the lead on the Justice sector. This sector i s critical for, among other things, improving the 
business climate (and, therefore, the promotion o f MSMEs), especially with regard to the proper 
functioning o f commercial courts. The Bank w i l l closely coordinate with the EU in this regard, 
but w i l l not be involved in this sector directly. Instead, the Bank w i l l focus on the other aspects o f 
improving the business climate in which other partners are not very present. Similarly, there i s a 
massive infrastructure program that i s ongoing, with financing fiom the Government as well as 
other partners such as China. The Bank’s limited resources w i l l be focused on maximizing 
benefits from, and ensuring the sustainability of, these investments, especially with respect to 
improving their management. This approach i s true for a l l the other sectors as well. 
76. 
During the consultations fo r the CPS, some partners expressed interest in moving 
towards a joint country assistance strategy. AFD, AfDB and the EU a l l approved their country 
assistance strategies in 2008. The end o f the Bank CPS period (June 2012) coincides, more or 
less, with the end dates o f these strategies. By selecting a three-year period for this CPS, the Bank 
w i l l be fully aligned with i t s partners, making a joint country strategy a distinct possibility (see 
Annex 4 for a summary description o f each principal partner’s strategy). I t i s expected that IFC 
w i l l also participate in such a joint strategy.

7 7 . 
A deepening o f the impact o f the global financial c r is is on Congo in the form o f a 
prolonged slump in o i l prices and accentuation o f demand shocks on other export goods 
would constitute a serious threat to macroeconomic stability and growth prospects (high 
r isk) . Congo has built up a strong f isca l and fore ign exchange reserve cushion through i t s o i l 
savings, but a pro longed slump in o i l prices cou ld create severe f isca l tensions. These tensions 
cou ld e i the r lead to a deterioration o f the f isca l stance, with serious negative imp l ica t ions on 
macroeconomic stability, wh ich cou ld resu l t in the PRGF getting o f f- track , o r in s ign i f ican t cuts 
in pub l ic spending. The latter wou ld undermine the imp lemen ta t ion o f the ambitious pub l ic 
investment program and thereby jeopardize the d ive rs i f ica t ion and g row th agenda. The Bank w i l l 
mon i to r c lose ly the situation, in close coord ina t ion with the IMF, and should this threat 
materialize, rea l ign i t s support accordingly. M o r e broadly, the Bank, in cooperation with other 
donors i s helping m i t iga te this risk on different fronts. On f isca l po l icy , it i s c r i t ica l to enhance 
spending e f f ic iency , so as t o imp rove preparedness fo r an increase in f isca l tension. In this regard, 
the Bank i s supporting the Government’s re fo rm e f for ts t o enhance e f f ic iency o f spending, 
through ana ly t ica l wo rk (PER), and through i t s Transparency and Governance Project on building 
capacity in budget management. In the l o n g term , a more d ive rs i f ied economy w i l l be more 
r e s i l i e n t t o external shocks than the current o i l dependent one. The Bank i s supporting the coun try 
in this d i rec t ion through the various ac t iv i t ies described in this CPS. 
78. While Congo has come a long way in trying to consolidate peace and rebuild public 
institutions, the situation i s still fragile (medium risk). A contested presidential election, or 
popu lar discontent, cou ld spark a fresh round o f c i v i l con f l ic t . The Bank, together w i t h partners 
like the EU, has been assisting with disarmament and demob i l iza t ion o f former combatants. This 
has helped reduce the rema in ing direct armed threats t o peace and s tab i l i ty . However, it i s clear 
that in the l o n g term , the risk o f destabilization and con f l ic t can on ly be m in im ized if there i s 
broad-based g row th that reduces pover ty s ign i f ican t ly in a l l parts o f the country. This i s 
consistent with the ma in or ien ta t ion o f the CPS. M o r e transparency and better governance in the 
management o f the country’s resources, par t icu lar ly o i l , i s pa r t icu la r ly impor tan t in this regard. 
The Bank supports this through comp le t ion o f the H I P C process and continued techn ica l 
assistance o n key governance areas. 
The reform progress could slow-down o r derail because o f political economy factors 
(high risk). Vested in te res t may delay e f fec t ive imp lemen ta t ion o f c r i t ica l re forms in areas like 
procurement o r o i l management. Strong pressures f r om un ions may postpone government 
decisions o n putting key infrastructure enterprises under pr iva te management. Resistance f rom 
pub l i c employees cou ld hamper e f for ts to shift personnel t o remote areas to enhance the reach 
and qua l i ty of social services. Under the I SN , the H I P C process contributed t o generating a 
momen tum fo r reforms. The ma in or ien ta t ion o f the CPS i s t o shift f r om a conditionality-based t o 
a more mature m idd le- income type o f relationship, and t o reach ou t t o a large spectrum o f actors. 
Through this approach, the CPS w i l l he lp ma in ta in the momen tum a f ter H I PC Comp le t ion Po in t 
and thereby m i t iga te any risk of reform s low-down thereafter. The Bank w i l l also continue i t s 
support t o non-governmental actors in the governance area, wh ich wou ld foster demand fo r 
increased transparency and accountability, pa r t icu la r ly in the areas o f pub l ic finance and o i l 
sector management. F ina l ly , the Bank w i l l he lp the Government assess the social costs, identify 
po ten t ia l “losers” f r om re fo rm measures and. devise possible compensatory measures as par t o f 
the Econom ic D ive rs i f ica t ion Support Project and ana ly t ica l ac t iv i t ies . 
80. 
Although there have been major improvements in portfolio quality, World Bank 
funded projects still face some fiduciary risks (medium r isk) . The number o f prob lem projects 

79 . 

29 

has declined from two to zero, in a portfolio o f five projects. However, the portfolio at risk by 
amount i s 34.7 percent. The main challenge i s limited capacity, especially in the area o f 
procurement. The recent improvements in portfolio quality are attributed to in tense training and 
constant hands-on support provided by the Bank’s procurement and financial management 
specialists who are now based in the country office. Annual Country Portfolio Performance 
Reviews, whose recommendations a re rigorously followed up, have been instituted starting in 
2008. The country director, who i s also based in the field (in the neighboring Democratic 
Republic o f Congo), has intensified high level dialogue on the portfolio. 
8 1. While desirable, increased investments in infrastructure, mining and urban 
development pose significant social and environmental r i s k s to the natural environment and 
could result in pollution and other undesirable side effects (medium risk). To address this 
issue , the Bank w i l l help the Republic o f Congo finalize a comprehensive body o f laws and 
regulations to deal w i th environmental impact assessment and mitigation (the country lacks 
environmental management tools a t this time). The Bank w i l l help strengthen the M in is t ry o f 
Environment, including the possibility o f creating a new Environment Agency to ensure that 
environmental laws and regulations are known and understood by private sector users, 
administrators and c i v i l society and adequate incentives and capacity are established to make 
enforcement systematic and effective.

Annex 2: Debt Sustainability Analysis for Congo 

1 . 

4 . 

This external debt sustainability analysis (DSA) i s an update o f the las t full DSA 
prepared for the Congo Republic in December 2008 . The DSA update i s based on the stock o f 
debt at end-December 2008, lower world o i l prices, and new borrowing. I t demonstrates that 
Congo continues to be a t high risk o f debt d is tress . The main conclusions o f the December 2008 
DSA remain valid, as the findings o f the update suggest that (see also chart 1 and table 1 below): 
The present value (PV) o f the debt-to-GDP ratio i s l ike ly to breach the indicative 
threshold over the medium t e r m (2009-22), then f a l l sharply and remain below the 
threshold thereafter (see Figure below). In comparison, the PV o f debt service-to-exports 
ratio for the baseline and historical scenarios are projected to be below the threshold 
throughout the period. 
The s t ress tes ts highlight Congo’s vulnerability to various shocks. Under an export shock, 
the PV o f debt-to-exports ratio i s above the threshold from 20 10 and remains there; and 
under a combination shock the PV o f debt-to-revenue ratio i s above the threshold until 
2020 but drops below it subsequently. 
The updated DSA i s based on the A p r i l 2009 World Economic Outlook assumptions on 
global o i l prices, which indicate a r i s e from US$ 52 per barrel in 2009 to US$ 75 in 2014. The 
main macroeconomic projections are an average r e a l GDP growth ra te o f 3.5 percent and a r i s e o f 
the curren t account de f ic i t to about 20 percent o f GDP over the long te rm . 
3 . 
The DSA update incorporates the recen t debt settlement w i th litigating creditors 
(involving a payment o f US$ 800 m i l l ion and cancellation o f US$ 1.7 b i l l ion in arrears in la te 
2008). This settlement resu l ts in a one-time increase in the debt outstanding in 2007, compared 
w i th the December 2008 DSA. 
A new full DSA w i l l be conducted in the second semester o f 2009 . This full DSA w i l l 
also include public debt, which takes into account the s ign i f ican t accumulation o f l iqu id 
government assets.

Annex 3: Performance Assessment o f Interim Strategy No te (FY07 - FY09) 

1. 
The FY04-FY06 Transitional Support Strategy aimed at consolidating peace and 
economic recovery. The rapid r i s e in o i l revenues in 2006 and 2007 led to increased spending 
and l e s s concern w i th improving the quality o f public expenditure and transparency. Under these 
conditions, i t was f e l t that an interim s tra tegy was more appropriate to give time to the authorities 
to bu i ld up a consensus on how to address critical governance issues . The Interim S tra tegy Note 
( ISN ) for FY08-FY09 was reviewed by the Board on July 31, 2007. I t was designed to scale up 
the governance focus and create the foundations for equitable growth. The governance agenda 
targeted better o i l sector governance and improved public financial management. The equitable 
growth agenda Rad a special emphasis on health, underserved communities in urban areas, and 
promoting ru ra l sector development to foster economic diversification and address deep poverty 

issues . 

2. 
The ISN suggested three strategic entry points: the HIPC process w i th triggers for 
Completion Point covering key governance issues, the PRSP process to bu i ld up a consensus on 
economic policies, and the strengthening o f key human and poverty alleviation programs in urban 
and rural areas. The expected two main outcomes were adherence to good governance principles 
and improved emphasis on poverty reduction. 

3 . 
After fiscal slippages and delays in structural reform precluded completion o f an 
earlier Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) approved by the IM F , the 
Government managed to reengage with the 1M.F in 2008. The Government success fu l ly 
completed a Staff Monitored Program that covered the period January to June 2008, and thereby a 
track record that led to resuming discussions on a PRGF arrangement. On December 8, 2008, the 
IMF approved a new three-year arrangement under the PRGF. 

4. 

I n 2008 the Government made progress on key governance and public finance 
management reforms. I t adopted and began implementing a Public Financial Management 
action plan, including a draft plan for managing public investments. Congo became a candidate to 
the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) in February 2008 and initiated work on i t s 
f i r s t report. In the o i l sector, the authorities adopted and began to apply a reform program for the 
state-owned re f ine ry (CORAF) and prepared an 
in i t ia l draft o f actions to bring the 
commercialization o f Congolese o i l up to international standards. They continued to certify o i l 
receipts on a quarterly basis to ensure transparency and accountability. These steps showed 
renewed government commitment to reform, but more time i s required for meeting the ambitious 
outcomes as se t forth in the ISN. 

5 . 

During the I S N implementation period, Bank assistance focused on strengthening 
the dialogue on growth and public finance management and on intensifying supervision o f 
the portfolio. In June 2008, the Bank and the Government held a high-level seminar to discuss 
growth and economic diversification issues. This led to the initiation o f analytical work on spa t ia l 
infrastructure development to strengthen the corridor approach, and on constraints and 
opportunities to private sector development. A public expenditure review was launched in a 
highly participative manner. I t should be completed by November 2009. 

6. 

The portfolio includes 5 projects: the Transparency and Governance Capacity Bu i ld ing 
project approved in 2002, for which a supplemental credit was approved in M a y 2007, the 
H IV /A IDS project approved in 2004, for which a supplemental credit i s under preparation, the 
Basic Education project approved in 2004, for which a supplemental c red i t i s also under

The outcome indicators in the I S N were not realistic in view o f the sho r t period 

covered by the I S N . Most o f t h em are u n l i k e l y t o b e ach ieved by the end o f June 2 0 0 9 . In the

Box: I S N Outcomes 

Transparency and public finance management: 
Outcome 1: SNPC receives unqualified financial audits b y end 2009 . N o t achieved: audits a re s t i l l 
qualified, but accounting has improved. 
Outcome 2 : National E I T I Committee i s constituted and i t s reports r e f l e c t Congo’s increased 
adherence to good governance and transparency in managing o i l revenues. Partially achieved: the EITI 
committee has been established but i s not f i l l y operational; a f i r s t report i s under preparation. 
Outcomes 3 and 4: Anti-corruption observatory c e r t i f i e s satisfactory progress in (i) improv ing o i l 
marketing; and (ii) implementing anti-corruption action plan. Partially achieved: the anti-corruption 
observatory has been established, but i s no t f i l l y operational. The Anti-Corruption action p lan i s under 
implementation. 
Outcome 5 : Government adopts a Public Finance Management Ac t ion Plan. Achieved 
Outcome 6: A l l contract award information related to pub l ic investment i s published. N o t achieved. 
Outcome 7: Congo’s PEFA ratings improve. N o assessment was made. 

Basic social services 
Outcome 8 : Increase number o f voluntary A IDS counseling and testing centers. Good progress was 
made under the H I V / A ID S project, but the I S N outcome indicator i s not part o f the project’s results 
framework. 
Outcome 9 : Increase effectiveness o f education services, so as to increase completion rate to 75% in 
primary, 40% in lower secondary and 15% in upper secondary. N o t achieved: the completion rate in 
primary education increased from 50 percent to 64 percent according to UN data (73 percent according 
to government data). The project being focused on basic education, the indicators for the other parts o f 
the education system were not relevant. 

Ru ra l growth 
Outcome 10: Improve transport infrastructure in rura l areas: not achieved 
Outcome 1 1 : Improve business environment for rura l producers: not achieved 
Outcome 12: Increase household income in targeted provinces b y 15%: no t achieved.

9 . 
ISN implementation provides important lessons f o r the preparation o f the CPS. 
These lessons focus i n particular on how to engage most effectively in a difficult governance 
environment, and how to make a difference in spite o f a limited IDA financing envelope: 
Realistic expectations. Expectations o f impact o f Bank support should be commensurate 
with the limited amount o f assistance provided. Significant time i s required fo r reaching a 
consensus on sensitive reforms a f ter decades o f economic mismanagement and internal 
conflicts, and the weak capacity in government administration. 
Strategic use o f Bank resources: IDA’s envelope o f about US$20 million per year pales 
in comparison to Government’s investment budget o f about US$I billion per year. I n 
order to have a rea l impact on growth, poverty, and social outcomes, Bank support w i l l 
need to be used in a more strategic manner whereby lending and non-lending activities 
w i l l particularly have to focus on spurring efficiency in, and more strategic choice of, 
largely Government financed programs. Similarly, IDA’s limited funds w i l l have to be 
leveraged with significant co-financing from the Government. Finally, in light o f IDA ’S 
limited administrative budget for activities in Congo, some o f the Bank’s support could 
be provided (at least partially) in the form offee-bused sewices for selected activities. 
Tackle governance from different angles: The Bank should complement its direct support 
to governance reforms with a more substantive engagement on helping accelerate growth, 
which i s a critical concern o f the Government. As the positive response o f the 
Government to the high-level seminar on growth and the policy dialogue on transport 
corridors have shown, this i s important to demonstrate to the authorities the value-added 
o f engaging with the Bank. A second and related lesson was that i t would be more 
effective to treat governance as a cross-cutting issue. Enhancing transparency and 
governance standards should not be treated in isolation, but as critical factors in 
improving effectiveness i n service delivery or infrastructure upgrading. Finally, the ISN 
experience showed that there i s a need to engage not only with the Government, but also 
with the demand-side o f governance to bring about lasting change i n these areas. This i s 
particularly true i n Congo’s post-conflict context, where formal and informal institutions 
in- and outside o f government are still weak in capacity. The positive e f fe c t o f Bank 
support to publication o f o i l revenue data or the creation o f an Anti-corruption 
Observatory are a case in point.

Annex 4: Description o f Country Assistance Strategies f o r Congo's Principal Partners 
(For Partners Whose In fo rma t ion Was Ava i lab le) 
1. 
Agence Francaise de Developuement (AFD). In M a r c h 2007, Congo and AFD signed a 
Partnership Framework Agreement. The agreement, w h i c h covers the pe r iod 2008 - 2012, was 
revised in M a y 2008. AFD's support i s focused on t h r e e sectors, infrastructure, environment 
pro tec t ion and educa t iod tra in ing . In the f i r s t area, AFD i s invo lved in (i) imp rov ing drainage 
services in Brazzaville, (ii) enhancing the capacity o f the po r t o f Po in te-No ire t o p lay an 
increasing ro le as a reg iona l port, (iii) supporting maintenance o f t h e river nav iga t ion system, and 
( iv) helping Government prepare and better manage infrastructure projects. In the second area, 
AFD i s focused o n helping Congo develop i t s forestry resources in a sustainable way within the 
broader reg iona l framework . In the third area, AFD supports imp lemen ta t ion o f a new strategy for 
technical education and voca t iona l t ra in ing in close association with the pr iva te sector. Add i t iona l 
support i s p rov ided t o the hea l th sector through a Sector-Wide Approach. Cross sectoral issues 
being addressed in the framework agreement inc lude governance (pub l ic investment program, 
social security, and jud ic iary) , higher education reform, and development o f c i v i l society 
organizations. The Bank w i l l w o r k closely with AFD on ensur ing that the e f f ic iency o f customs 
services in the po r t o f Po in te-No ire i s enhanced. I t w i l l also w o r k with AFD on the forestry sector 
and governance issues . 

2. 
A f r ican Deve lopmen t Bank (AfDB). In M a y 2008, the AfDB adopted a coun try strategy 
paper fo r 2008-12, wh ich aims at con tr ibu t ing to pover ty reduc t ion and attainment o f the 
in terven t ion areas: (i) infrastructure 
M i l l e n n i um Deve lopmen t Goals 
through 
tw o key 
development t o support g row th and improve the l i v i n g environment (water, sanitation and 
electricity); and (ii) p romo t ion o f macroeconomic s tab i l i ty and grow th . Under the proposed 
U rban Deve lopmen t and Water Supply Project t o be funded by the Bank w i l l focus on urban 
services and water supply wh i le the AfDB w i l l focus o n f inanc ing sanitation. Unde r the second 
p i l lar , AfDB envisages an ins t i tu t iona l support t o strengthen the resource a l loca t ion system and 
the business c l ima te . The proposed Econom ic D ive rs i f ica t ion Support Pro jec t w i l l be closely 
coordinated with AfDB. AfDB finances feas ib i l i ty studies 
fo r key reg iona l in tegra t ion 
infrastructure and facilities, inc lud ing the proposed Brazzav i l le-K inshasa bridge, a c r i t ica l road 
link be tween Congo, Gabon and Cameroon, and investment f o r enhancing the e f f ic iency o f the 
Cen tra l A f r ican Power Pool. The AfDB also intends to support statistical capacity development 
through the In terna t iona l Comparison Program work ; this w o u l d support the imp lemen ta t ion o f 
the na t iona l statistical development strategy rather than i t s preparation. 

3 . 
European U n i o n (EU). In January 2008, the Government and the EU signed a new 
program o f assistance fo r 2008-2013 w i t h t w o envelopes, one o f EUR 85 m i l l i o n f o r the regular 
program and the other o f EUR 3.9 m i l l i o n fo r emergency situations. The program w i l l support 
tw o broad objectives, reg iona l in tegra t ion and governance. Unde r the f i r s t objective the focus i s 
on transport in fras truc ture and economic d ivers i f ica t ion . Under the second objective, the focus i s 
on pub l ic finance management (internal and external controls) and economic governance 
( inc lud ing in the forestry sector, the business c l ima te and support t o medium- and small-scale 
enterprises). In addition, support w i l l be prov ided t o the hea l th sector and to furthering the rule o f 
law . The Bank intends t o w o r k c lose ly with the EU on re fo rm ing the management o f the CFCO, 
the ma in item under the transport infrastructure component o f the program, enhancing the 
efficiency of the r ive r po r t in Brazzaville, imp rov ing pub l ic finance management and the t h r e e 
elements o f the economic governance agenda.

Partnership w i th in the World Bank Group 

4. - IFC. Currently, IFC does not have an active project in the country, but continues to 
pursue prospects for involvement i n projects along the following strategic priorities: (i) 
proactively support the improvement o f the country’s business environment so as to foster more 
foreign investment and facilitate the growth o f the MSME sector; (ii) develop and support MSME 
projects that w i l l capitalize on the country’s vibrant o i l sector and derive positive externalities 
from this activity by providing goods and services to this sector; and (iii) facilitate access to 
f inance for these local MSMEs by entering into partnerships w i th banks and other financial 
institutions, and providing capacity-building to both the banks as we l l as the MSMEs. As 
indicated earlier, the Bank shall work very closely w i th IFC, especially on supporting the MSME 
sector, w i th the Bank focusing on the improving the business environment to complement IFC’s 
activities, especially those related to access to credit. The two institutions w i l l also work very 
closely on the agribusiness sector. 

5 . 

M IGA . Congo has been a M I G A member s ince 1991 and contributed to M IGA ’s General 
Capital Increase in March 2003. M I G A currently has no exposure in the Republic o f Congo, and 
there i s no active application. In the course o f implementing the activities proposed under this 
CPS, the Bank w i l l work very closely w i th M IGA , especially w i th respect to attracting foreign 
investors in the infrastructure, mining, and agro-business sectors. M I G A may be invited to 
provide guarantees to Public-Private Partnerships. 

6 . 
FIAS and PPIAF. The Foreign Investment Advisory Service and the Public-Private 
Infrastructure Advisory Facility are expected to work closely w i th the Africa Region in the areas 
o f investment climate reform and strategic work on infrastructure reform and development.
