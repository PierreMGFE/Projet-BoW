EXECUT IVE SUMMARY 
1. 
This Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) comes at the beginning of a new 
political cycle f o r El Salvador. After 20 years in the opposition, the Frente Farabundo 
M a r t i p a r a la L ibe rac ion Nac iona l (FMLN) has come to power fo l low ing the 
Presidential elections that took place in Ma rch 2009 . The democratic transition, 
inc lud ing fair elections, respect for the po l i t ica l process and smooth cooperative 
transition i s significant and i s an important contribution to po l i t ica l stability in the region. 
The FMLN received broad support in the elections, and so far has shown significant 
moderation balancing concerns across party l ines . 
2 . 
President Mauricio Funes ran on a pro-poor platform that stressed 
broadening o f soc ia l programs and inclusive economic growth. The government’s 
electoral p la t fo rm included a clear social po l icy agenda, with an emphasis on 
employment, j o b creation, p rov is ion o f basic health and education services and social 
protection for the poor. The creation o f institutional mechanisms to promote the 
participatory development o f economic and social po l icy was also a cornerstone o f the 
electoral platform. 
3 . 
The new government came to power against the backdrop of a severe global 
economic c r i s i s that i s being strongly felt in El Salvador. Fo l low ing several years o f 
positive growth performance, the current crisis i s having a significant e f f e c t on the 
country’s economy. Desp i te i n i t i a l projections above 4 percent, GDP g row th reached 
on ly 2.5 percent in 2008 . Current projections foresee a GDP decline o f about 2.5 percent 
in 2009 . This wou ld be the first full-year o f GDP contraction in over two decades. By 
early 2009 , tens o f thousands o f Salvadoran households had been affected by the loss o f 
jobs, especially in the export sector, reduction in incomes and a sharp drop in 
remittances. 
4. 
The impact o f the global economic c r i s i s o n El Salvador has generated 
economic and social risks, limiting the ability o f the new government to implement 
its long-term social policy agenda. The current economic contraction and financial 
market instability compound the problem o f a dramatic increase in the poverty rate 
fo l low ing the food and o i l price hike in 2008 , and threaten hard-won recent poverty and 
social gains. A f te r several years o f pro-poor economic g row th the poverty headcount rate 
increased f rom 35 .5 percent in 2007 to 42.3 in 2008 , reaching the highest ratio s ince 
2002 . The dramatic reverse o f poverty trends shows that Salvadorian economy i s s t i l l 
fragile and h igh ly vulnerable to shocks. This i s particularly wo r ry ing in the current 
environment o f the financial crisis which w i l l hit the employment channe l as well. 
I n response to the economic and social reality, President Funes presented the 
government’s “Anti-Crisis Plan” within weeks of taking office. The An t i -C r is is Plan 
(PAC) proposes responses geared to mitigate the immediate effects o f the c r i s i s on the 
most vulnerable population as well as to prepare the conditions fo r a broad-based 
recovery once global conditions s ta r t imp rov ing . The P AC comprises the f o l l ow i n g 
components: (i) an income protection and employment generation program; (ii) the 
creation o f a comprehensive and universal social protection system; (iii) the 
strengthening o f pub l ic finances; and (iv) a comprehensive consultative process to 

5 .

prepare a na t iona l deve lopmen t plan f o r med ium - te rm recove ry and long - te rm 
development. 
6. 
T o compound the challenges described above, the new government was also 
confronted with a rapidly deteriorating fiscal outlook. The cu r ren t f i s c a l challenges 
were b rough t o n by the impac t o f the c r is is o n tax collection, and inc lude : (i) t o recover a 
s o l i d f isca l balance w h i c h has deteriorated due t o the crisis; and (ii) t o finance p r i o r i t y 
investments requ i red t o m i t i g a t e the social effects o f the c r is is and set the stage f o r a 
s t rong economic recovery. T o address the challenges the gove rnmen t i s p ropos ing tax 
r e f o rm and ra t iona l iza t ion o f subsidies t o imp rove the med ium - te rm ou t loo k . 
7. 
The CPS i s based o n the strategic principle o f meeting immediate needs to 
mitigate the impact of the c r i s i s while, at the same time, addressing longer-term 
development challenges. G i v e n the current economic uncertainties, the CPS proposes a 
f l e x i b l e approach where o n l y the lend ing operations o f the first year are specified and 
n e w ac t iv i t ies w i l l be de f ined in close dialogue with the au tho r i t ies as the N a t i o n a l 
Deve lopmen t Plan i s defined. The CPS proposes a three year US $ 6 5 0 m i l l i o n lend ing 
program, subject t o ava i lab i l i ty o f IBRD resources, i n c l u d i n g US$250 m i l l i o n f o r FY 10. 
The government has selected three strategic objectives f o r Bank support: (i) strengthen 
fundamentals 
f o r econom ic 
recove ry by addressing mac ro and 
ins t i tu t iona l 
vulnerabilities; (ii) strengthen de l ive ry o f social services; and (iii) increase economic 
opportunities, pa r t icu la r ly f o r the poo r . The I F C p rog ram inc ludes adv iso r y services and 
f inanc ia l assistance a l igned with the government’s p r io r i t ies and p rog rams building o n 
current and po ten t ia l synergies with the Bank when feasible. 
This CPS has identified modest outcomes which i t expects to influence. The 
Results F ramewo rk (Annex 2) i s organized acco rd ing t o the three strategic objectives 
men t ioned above. Given the l i m i t e d size and breadth o f the current Bank program, the 
CPS proposes a streamlined resu l ts m a t r i x w h i c h includes an ind ica t ive set o f outcomes 
that are consistent with the scope o f the c r is is response p rog ram that has been de f ined t o 
date. Performance towa rds outcomes w i l l be assessed at the CPS Progress Repo r t and the 
Results F ramewo rk w i l l be upda ted t o re f lec t progress made and new p r i o r i t i e s i d e n t i f i e d 
f o r Bank support. 
The lessons in the CAS Completion Report have been taken into account in 
the design o f the CPS, including the importance o f consensus-building efforts to 
ensure successful implementation of the program in a politically polarized 
environment. T h e 2005 C A S underestimated the imp l ica t ion s o f E l Salvador’s d i v i d e d 
p o l i t i c a l environment. W h i l e the expectation i s that the cu r ren t s i tua t ion i s different, the 
Bank and Gove rnmen t i n t e n d t o m i t iga te the r i s k o f i n d i v i d u a l loans becom ing p o l i t i c a l 
instruments by p resen t ing a package .o f loans t o be approved by Congress. A s such, this 
CPS i s accompanied by three operations: a US$lOO m i l l i o n Sustaining Social Gains for 
Economic Recovery D P L , a U S $ 5 0 m i l l i o n Income Support and Emp loyab i l i ty Project, 
and a US$20 m i l l i o n F isca l Management and Pub l ic Sector Development Technical 
Assistance P ro jec t .

I. Introduction 

El Salvador CPS 

1. 
This Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), covering the fiscal years 2010- 
2012, comes at the beginning o f a new political cycle for El Salvador and against the 
backdrop of a global economic c r is is . A f te r 20 years in the opposition, the Frente 
Fa rabundo M a r t i para la L ibe rac ion Nac iona l (FMLN) came to power with an explicit 
agenda to accelerate implementation o f social programs and promote inclusive economic 
growth. However, the current economic reality, and more specifically the fiscal impact 
o f the crisis, w i l l make delivering o n campaign promises d i f f icu l t . The WBG strategy i s 
supporting the government with a flexible approach designed to balance the need to 
mitigate the impact o f the crisis while, at the same time, address the longer-term 
development challenges. The CPS proposes an indicative lending program o f US$650 
m i l l i o n ’ o f which US$250 m i l l i o n i s confirmed fo r FY10 . The I FC program includes bo th 
advisory services and financial assistance aligned with the new government’s priorities 
and programs bu i ld ing o n current and potential synergies with the Bank when feasible. 

11. Country Context 

2. 
El Salvador i s a lower middle income country which stands out in the Latin 
America region for its structural economic reforms and stable macro policies. E l 
Salvador i s a small and densely populated country in Central America with a population 
o f 6.9 m i l l i o n people and a GNI per capita o f US$3,480 (2008). E l Salvador has pursued 
an outward oriented development strategy, inc lud ing being the f i r s t nation to implement a 
.regional free-trade agreement (DR -CAFTA ) with the U .S . in Ma rch 2006. Facilitated by 
a dollarized monetary regime, a sound macroeconomic framework and a strong record o f 
economic reforms, E l Salvador has diversified i t s export sector, and improved i t s access 
to international financial markets. 

3 . 
El Salvador has had relatively strong economic performance in recent years. 
Over the last CAS pe r iod (2005-2009) economic growth steadily imp roved f rom 2.3 
percent in 2003 reaching 4.2 percent in 2006 and 4.7 in 2007, up f rom 2.1 percent over 
the pe r iod 2000 to 2004. The observed acceleration in economic g row th was triggered t o 
a large extent by rap id improvements in the external environment wh ich resulted in 
cumulative export g row th o f 26.2 percent between 2002 and 2007. In addition, the 
country’s traditional sound macroeconomic management facilitated the transmission o f 
positive global developments. A l though fa i r ly positive compared to previous periods, 
economic performance continues to be be low the Central American average in many 
respects. 

4. 
Progress on the economic front has been accompanied by improvements in 
the country’s social conditions, with the main social indicators-including poverty 
and inequality-showing significant gains in recent years. Higher income levels, 
combined with increasing social sector spending and reforms in some key sectors, 

~~~

~~

resulted in a decline in poverty levels f rom 43.6 in 2001 to 35 .5 percent in 2007. In 
addition, a number o f social indicators such as l i f e expectancy, infant and ch i ld mortality, 
and c h i l d nu t r i t ion have improved. School enrollment levels have r i sen significantly - 
f r om 89 percen t and 46 percent fo r primary and secondary in 2001 to 92 percent and 54 
percent respectively in 2007. In several areas, inc lud ing in primary education and access 
to water and sanitation, the improvements in the indicators have been accompanied b y a 
reduction in the gap between the poor and the non-poor. 

5 . 

I n fact, most o f the current decade can be characterized by years o f pro-poor 
economic growth. Du r ing 2002-2006 the annual average g row th rate o f incomes fo r the 
f i r s t deciles (the poorest) was much higher in comparison to Salvadorans in upper parts o f 
the income distribution. Overall, 
inequality -measured by the ’ Gini coefficient- 
diminished b y 6 points, f rom 0.52 in 2001 t o 0.46 in 2008. These improvements are also 
in l i n e with an increase in social spending aimed at attacking poverty, in particular o f Red 
Solidaria -a poverty reduction program in i t ia ted in 2006. 

6. 
Poverty trends in the 2000’s can be divided in t w o periods: a poverty 
reduction phase until 2006 and the reverse o f the tendency in 2007-2008. In the f i r s t 
phase o f the cycle poverty f e l l 8.6 percentage points. This phenomenon was even 
stronger in rural areas (decreased 17.4 percentage points), and also lead to a more equal 
income distribution. 
In 2007-2008, the food crisis hit E l Salvador hard, and almost a l l 
the gains in t e rm s o f poverty reduction were lost. The poverty headcount rate increased 
f r om 35.5 pe rcen t in 2007 to 42.3 in 2008, reaching the highest ratio since 2002. 

7. 
The dramatic reverse o f poverty trends shows that Salvadorian economy i s 
s t i l l fragile and highly vulnerable to shocks. Thus, pub l ic policies should focus on bo th 
protecting and generating employment, and shielding salaries and incomes. The food 
crisis has already showed the f rag i l i t y o f the p r i c e channel: food staples’ prices grew 17 
percent in 2008 while per capita income increased on ly 5 percent. This i s particularly 
wo r ry ing in the cu r ren t environment o f the financial crisis wh ich w i l l hit t h e employment 
channel as well,

In 2006, E l Salvador registered the highest rate o f hom ic ides in a l l L a t i n Ame r ica (58 o f every 100,000 
inhabitants).’ A Bank repo r t o n C r ime and V io lence in Cen tra l Ame r ica (CA ) puts this ra te in perspective:

El Salvador i s an economically unequal society w i th high levels o f poverty and an expanding 
youth population. H a l f o f the popu la t ion in E l Salvador i s under 30 years old. Many young people 
have limited education w i t h just over one- th ird en ro l l ing in high school. The unemp loymen t rate fo r 
y o u t h i s over 10% and o f those who do work, 80% are in low -pay ing i n f o rm a l jobs . Many l i v e in

Increasing levels o f crime and violence continue to affect not only El 
Salvador, but the sub-region more generally, and threaten development progress. 
Cu r ren t statistics ind ica te 12 cases o f v io len t c r imes per day in E l Salvador. The rising 
inc idence o f drug t r a f f i c k i n g in ne ighbo r ing countries i s also cause f o r increasing 
concern. This s i tua t ion i s a f fec t ing you th in pa r t icu la r , as seen by the high incidence o f 
y o u t h gangs. This i s a comp lex issue that goes beyond coun t ry borders. Progress w i l l 
requ i re a comprehensive and mu l t i la te ra l approach, a long with spec i f ic in te rven t ions at 
l o c a l levels, t o strengthen p reven t ion in i t ia t ives (see B o x 1). 

12. Within this context, the FMLN came to power in June 2009, after winning 
the Congressional and Presidential elections, with a pro-poor agenda aimed at 
accelerating implementation of social programs. The democratic transition, i n c l u d i n g 
f a i r elections, respect f o r the p o l i t i c a l process and smoo th cooperative change o f 
adm in is t ra t ion i s s ign i f ican t and stands ou t in the reg ion . The pa r t y rece ived b road 
support, and so far has shown s ign i f ican t mode ra t ion ba lanc ing concerns across party 
lines. 

13 . 

The new government, however, does not have a majority in Congress and 
will need to negotiate a l l initiatives requiring congressional support. This represents 
an add i t iona l challenge f o r the government t o imp lemen t po l ic ies and programs, as w e l l 
as t o r a t i f y W o r l d Bank lend ing ac t iv i t ies . In fac t five operations w h i c h been approved 
under the p rev ious C A S had t o be canceled w h e n Congress f a i l e d t o r a t i f y the loans. 
A l t h o u g h this experience suggests p o l i t i c a l issues c o u l d be a m a j o r obstacle f o r the 
deve lopmen t o f p u b l i c policies, the no tab ly smoo th p o l i t i c a l t rans i t ion process m a y 
ind ica te tha t p o l i t i c a l practices are e v o l v i n g and tha t the t rad i t iona l ly po la r ized system 
c o u l d be overcome within this n ew context. 

14. 
The new authorities have requested support from the multilateral banks to 
help the country cope with the cr is is . In v i e w o f the current situation, the authorities 
have ind ica ted the need f o r a comb ina t ion o f f inanc ing resources t o he lp close ex is t ing 
f inanc ing gaps and finance the development program, as well as techn ica l assistance t o 
support i t s imp lemen ta t ion . Recogn iz ing the impo r tance o f a sound mac ro f ramewo rk , 
the au tho r i t ies have also agreed with the IMF o n a n e w three year Standby Arrangement, 
w h i c h they in tend t o treat as precautionary. 

A. Recent Economic Developments 

15. 
Until 2008 the growth performance o f El Salvador was broadly positive, but 
the global c r i s i s i s having a significant effect on the country’s economy. In 2008 E l 
Salvador started fee l ing the effects o f the g loba l c r is is and, despite i n i t i a l p ro jec t ions 
above 4 percent, GDP g r ow t h reached o n l y 2.5 percent. Cu r ren t p ro jec t ions foresee a 
dec l ine o f G D P by abou t 2.5 percent in 2009. T h i s w o u l d b e the first fu l l - yea r GD P 
con t rac t ion in over t w o decades. 

16. 
There a re several elements behind the evolution of economic activity, 
including lowe r domestic 
investment, a dramatic deterioration in export 

5 

performance, and a marked decline in workers’ remittances. O n the inves tmen t front, 
gross domestic inves tmen t i s expected t o decline f r o m 16.1 percent o f GDP in 2007 t o 
about 13.1 percent in 2009. This dec l ine w o u l d be m a i n l y d r i v e n by l ow e r p r iva te 
inves tmen t w h i c h already dec l ined f r o m 14.1 percent o f GD P in 2007 t o 12.8 percent o f 
G D P in 2008 and i s expected t o further dec l ine t o 11.1 percent in 2009. At the same 
p u b l i c inves tmen t has n o t been able t o o f fse t this change as i t j u s t increased o n l y f r o m 2 
percent o f G D P in 2007 t o 2.1 percent in 2008 and 2009. O n the expo r t front, f o l l ow i n g 
the pos i t ive developments o f the past f e w years, exports receipts dec l ined ove r the f i rs t 
h a l f o f 2009 by 16.5 percent with respect t o the same p e r i o d o f 2008 o n account o f b o t h 
l ow e r vo lume (-14 percent) and l ow e r p r ices (-2.5 percent). F o r the year as a whole, 
expo r t receipts are expected t o dec l ine by about 15 percent in 2009. 

17. 
Remittances, which in El Salvador represented 18.1 percent o f GDP in 2007, 
started to decrease in the second semester o f 2008 and abruptly dropped in the first 
Indeed, ove r the first s i x mon ths o f 2009 remittances reached 
quarter o f 2009. 
US$1,740 m i l l i o n and th is w o u l d be in contrast with the f l o w ove r the f i r s t six mon ths o f 
2008 w h e n remittances reached US$1,939 m i l l i o n (Le., a decline o f m o r e than 10 
percent). Desp i te this decline, f o r 2009 as a whole, remittances are expected t o represent 
15.7 percent o f GDP. 

18. 
The economic contraction i s having a negative impact on the country’s labor 
markets. The g loba l f inanc ia l c r is is and dec l ine in remittances fo r ced E l Salvador’s 
banks t o res t r ic t c red i t t o the S M E sector, the m a i n source o f emp loymen t in E l Salvador. 
The 2008 (formal) unemp loymen t rate was 5.9 percent (the lowes t in m o r e than one 
decade) and even i f E l Salvador does n o t repo r t pe r iod ica l figures, 
the available 
i n f o rm a t i o n po in ts t o an increase in 2009. A c c o r d i n g t o the Salvadoran Soc ia l Secu r i ty 
Institute (ISSS), f o rm a l emp loymen t was f a l l i n g at an annualized rate o f 3 percent in 
Feb rua ry 2009. Taking i n t o account 
the ex is t ing co r re la t ion be tween na t iona l 
emp loymen t rates and soc ia l secu r i ty con t r ibu t ions (.78), 
the country’s unemp loymen t 
c o u l d increase t o about 9 -10 percent by end 2009 (the highest in m o r e than one decade). 

19. El Salvador had been making continued improvements on the fiscal front 
over the past few years, with the non financial public sector deficit falling to 1.9 
percent o f GDP in 2007 from a peak o f 4.4 percent in 2001 and 2002. No tab ly , the 
p r im a r y balance showed a surplus o f 0.6 percent o f GD P in 2007 f o r the first time in 
mo re than a decade. T h e observed f isca l conso l ida t ion was la rge ly due t o s t rong revenue 
performance as the gove rnmen t managed t o increase tax revenues by nea r ly 1.0 percent 
o f G D P between 2005 and 2007. Howeve r , t h i s t rend did n o t persist in 2008 as p u b l i c 
spending increased at faster rate than f isca l revenue (15 and 10 percent with respect t o 
2007 respectively). A s a result, 2008 closed with a f isca l d e f i c i t o f 3.1 percent o f GDP. 

20. 
The c r i s i s has resulted in an increasingly tight fiscal situation. The f isca l 
s i tua t ion has con t inued t o deteriorate during the f i r s t h a l f o f 2009 t o a la rge extent 
because o f the negative impac t o f the c r is is o n tax co l lec t ion . A s in many o the r countries, 
the economic s l ow d ow n has resu l ted in a s ign i f ican t decline in tax revenue. During the 
first h a l f o f 2009 tax co l lec t ion (w h i c h represents th ree quarters o f f isca l revenues) was 

6 

12 percent lower than during the same period o f the previous year and fo r the year as 
whole estimates o f Government revenue have been cut down f r om 17.2 percent o f GDP 
to 15.5 percent. 

21. On the spending side, the government has been showing restraint keeping 
spending levels below those envisaged in the IMF Standby program approved in 
early 2009 . Yet, as a percentage o f GDP public spending i s expected to increase f rom an 
early estimate o f 20.1 percent to a current estimate i f 20.8 percent. The combination o f 
these e lemen ts i s expected to resu l t in a public sector fiscal de f ic i t o f 5.3 percent o f GDP 
in 2009. The Government has also sought multilateral support to cover the fiscal gap o f 
2009.

22. On the external front the current account deficit i s expected to improve in 
2009 . After averaging 3.5 percent o f GDP in 2005-2006, the current account deficit 
expanded to 5 . 5 percent o f GDP in 2007. This d e f i c i t was financed by large capital 
in f lows (7.0 percen t o f GDP), in part related to the sale o f th ree major domestic banks to 
foreign buyers in 2007. The current account de f ic i t further deteriorated in 2008 to 7.2 
percent as a resu l t o f the h i g h food and o i l prices. As w i t h most countries in the region, 
imports have contracted more than exports in 2009. As a resu l t , the current account 
deficit i s expected t o f a l l to 1.7 percent o f GDP as the trade balance improves.

The banking sec to r i n El Salvador has coped relatively well w ith both the 
global c r is is and the change in administration. In add i t ion t o the challenges put by 
g loba l developments, during 2009 Salvadoran investors and bankers were concerned 
about the p o l i t i c a l r isks f o l l ow i n g the election, i n c l u d i n g a possible run o n the banks. T o 
address this concern, the Superintendence o f Banks raised the liquidity requirements f r o m 
25 percent t o 28 percent o f deposits, coun t ing as liquid o n l y assets deposited abroad in 
highly liquid instruments (managed by the Cen t ra l Bank). As a resu l t o f the raised 
requirements and o f the i r own concerns, banks ra ised their liquidity ra t ios t o an average 
that, by M a y 2009, h a d reached 46 percent o f assets. 

24. 
Currently, capital adequacy ratios are at levels comparable to those observed 
before the current financial turmoil and well above the regulatory minimum o f 12 
percent. The system i s re la t i ve ly liquid with ne t liquid assets t o short-term l i a b i l i t i e s o f 
34.4 percent. Howeve r , the comb ined e f fec t o f the g r ow t h s l ow d ow n and l ow e r 
remittances g r ow t h i s lead ing t o an increase in non -pe r fo rm ing loans (NPLs). By 
Feb rua ry 2009 NPLs h a d increased by 3 0 percent re la t ive t o the s am e m o n t h in 2008. 
W h i l e there a re n o data re la t ive t o sectors, i t i s s ign i f ican t tha t the tw o banks with the 
h ighe r exposure t o consumer c red i t have the h ighes t l e v e l o f NPLs and the highest rate o f 
g r ow t h o f these loans. By February, fou r o f the f i v e largest banks had p rov is ioned 
be tween 100 percent and 122 percent o f the NPLs, and o n l y one o f them was m a r g i n a l l y 
b e l ow 100 percent. 

25. 
As pa r t o f the recovery plan, the Government i s also planning to escalate 
public sector banking lending through t w o existing first tier institutions-Banco 
Hipotecario and Banco de Fomento Agropecuario-and 
th rough a second-tier i n s t i t u t i o n 
that w o u l d be tu rned i n t o a f i r s t t ie r bank -Banco Multilateral de Inversiones (BMI).’ 
Howeve r , th is strategy w i l l requ i re close m o n i t o r i n g t o ensure the f inanc ia l soundness o f 
these ins t i tu t ions . 

B. Macroeconomic Prospects and Debt Sustainability 

26. 
Recen t indicators suggesting that economic activity i s starting to turn around 
in the United States are particularly relevant in the Salvadoran context. 48 percent 
o f Salvadoran exports are d i rec ted t o the U n i t e d States and wo rke rs ’ remittances (ma in ly 
f r o m the U n i t e d States) represent m o r e than 15 percent o f GDP. Thus, a recove ry in the 
U n i t e d States i s expected t o r e s u l t (a l though with some lags) in a la rge r demand f o r 
Salvadoran p roduc ts as w e l l as a l l o w remittances f l ow s t o reve r t the dec l ine o f 2009. 
Cu r ren t estimates foresee a recove ry in GDP g r ow t h rates t o about 0.5 percent in 2010, 2 
percent in 2 0 1 1 , and a round 3 percent in 20 12 and 4 percent in 2 0 13 and 2 0 14. (Table 3). 

BMI was created to provide medium and long-term resources to the banks. S i n c e dollarization, the 
commercial banks’ demand for BMI finds declined sharply because they could mob i l ize long-term 
resources much cheaper than the cost o f BMI funds.

tha t w o u l d be consistent with a moderate increase t o 2.5 percent in 2010 and 2.8 percent

observed since February 2009 (when the ba r re l o f WT I o i l reached US$39.1) t o US$69 .9 
by midyear, and the recove ry in f o o d p r ices w h i c h after h a v i n g dec l ined by 4 0 percent in

on the tax collection front. Similarly, the 2010 budget i s expected to include about 
US$350 m i l l i o n (1.5 pe rcen t o f GDP) in programs and projects f rom the government’s 
“Anti-Crisis Plan” pushing public spending to 21.3 percent o f GDP. In order to cover the 
additional financing needs emerging f rom the revised de f ic i t fo r 2010 the government i s 
re ly ing o n multilateral support. The Inter American Development Bank (IDB) i s 
preparing a US$200 m i l l i o n budget support operation planned fo r 201 0 disbursement. 
Beyond 2010, permanent commitments associated to the “Anti-Crisis Plan” could add to 
pub l ic spending between US$200 and US$250 m i l l i o n (depending on h ow coverage o f 
the programs evolves) per year (0.8 percent to 1 percent o f GDP). 

30. 
Public debt levels a re also a concern. After declining f r om 42.1 percent o f GDP 
in 2003 t o 39.1 percent o f GDP in 2007, the stock o f total pub l ic debt increased to 41.2 
percent o f GDP ( o f which 23.7 was external public debt) in 2008 and i s expected to 
further increase in 2009 to 47.7 percent o f GDP ( o f which 30 percent wou ld be external 

pub l ic debt). 

31. 
The government i s aware o f the need to reduce the fiscal deficit once the 
c r is is i s over and bring the debt path to a sustainable level. In this regard, with Wo r ld 
Bank and IMF support, the administration i s wo rk ing on the preparation o f legislation 
that w i l l include a re fo rm o f the tax administration. Measures under consideration include 
administrative actions t o f igh t tax evasion, introduction o f new taxes (such as a new tax 
o n vehicles) and adjustment o f some taxes (such as those on alcoholic beverages). O n the 
spending side, the government i s preparing a p lan to rationalize existing subsidies in the 
water, transport, and gas sectors. This wou ld be in addition to the actions already taken 
on the electricity f ron t (supported by the Bank’s Public Finance and Social Sector 
Development Po l icy Loan) to reduce the electricity subsidy fo r f i r m s . As a resu l t , the 
fiscal de f ic i t i s expected to dec l ine to le ss than 2 percent o f GDP in 2014. 

32. 
A revised DSA has been prepared to reflect the recent deterioration in the 
medium term macroeconomic outlook. The DSA indicates that pub l ic debt i s expected 
to increase to above 50 percent o f GDP in 201 1 and then start declining as the overall 
balance o f the pub l ic sector increases. As for the evolution o f the external debt, Annex 4 
indicates that the total external debt to GDP ratio w i l l decline t o about 40 percent o f GDP 
b y 2014. 

33 . 
Despite the global c r i s i s economic fundamentals remain solid and the 
government has agreed with the IMF on a macro framework to set the debt 
trajectory on a sustainable path. The macro framework described above wou ld be 
supported by a new th ree year Standby Arrangement (SBA) with the IMF that the 
authorities intend to treat as precautionary. The IMF and authorities agreed that given the 
current context i t was more appropriate to reach agreement on a new SBA, than t o extend 
the SBA approved e a r l i e r in 2009.

111. Development Challenges and Government Priorities 

34. 
The new administration faces several development challenges and the way in 
which they a re addressed could have profound implications f o r the future. A s 

summa r ized above, the economic challenges have b o t h a short and l o n g t e rm dimension. 
On the f i sca l front, the short te rm challenge i s t o reduce the d e f i c i t t o sustainable levels. 
In the longe r run, actions are needed t o increase the f isca l space t o finance p r i o r i t y 
investments. S im i la r ly , with respect t o accelerating growth, short t e r m actions shou ld 
focus o n reac t iva t ing the economy, w h i l e in the l o n g run, measures are needed t o address 
the coun t ry ’s l o w s t ruc tu ra l g r ow t h rate. F ina l ly , in terms o f pove r t y reduction,

management and strengthening ins t i tu t ions i s a transversal theme f o r im p r o v i n g l o n g 
t e rm prospects. 

35 . Within this context, the government has prioritized the implementation o f an 
“Anti-Crisis Plan” f o r 2009-201 1 that was announced immediately after its 

inauguration. The An t i -C r is i s P l a n (PAC) recognizes the short-term impac t o f the c r is is 
and, w i t h o u t i g n o r i n g med ium - te rm challenges; proposes responses geared t o b o t h

36. 
The PAC balances we l l the short-term needs as we l l as the medium-term 
strategic priorities f o r the country. The measures p roposed are also in l i n e with c r is is 

response in other countries, i n c l u d i n g p ropos ing measures t o strengthen p u b l i c finance

11 

associated with a change in adm in is t ra t ion . To con ta in the cost o f the P A C and ensure i t s 
financing, the government has been selective in choosing w h i c h programs t o inc lude in 
the PAC , and also ind ica ted that the P A C w i l l be accommodated within the budget. 

37. While the government i s still refining its long run development strategy i t has 
expressed its intention to continue implementation of ongoing policies and programs 
that proved effective and to adjust and strengthen interventions in areas where 
results were not as significant. The f o l l ow i n g sections in t roduce spec i f ic development 
challenges in p r i o r i t y areas: g r ow t h and competitiveness, pove r t y and inequa l i ty , p u b l i c 
sector and ins t i tu t iona l development, and env i ronmen t and disaster m i t iga t ion . 

A. Growth and Competitiveness 

38. 
Beyond the measures necessary to ensure macroeconomic stability in the 
shorter term, one o f El Salvador’s key challenges i s improving growth prospects. E l 
Salvador has succeeded in fos te r ing trade openness and inc reas ing non - t rad i t iona l 
exports. Since C A F T A DR was implemented, yea r ly average trade f l ow s have reached 
US$5,219 m i l l i o n . C A F T A DR has also a l l ow e d the coun t ry t o strengthen exports 
towa rds Cen t ra l Am e r i c a and the D om i n i c a n Republic, and in 2008 exports increased 
12.8 percent. Howeve r , the current g loba l env i ronmen t i s nega t ive ly im p a c t i n g trade 
f lows , and therefore i t w i l l be impo r tan t t o con t inue e f fo r ts t o enhance the country’s 
competitiveness as a w a y t o foster oppo r tun i t ies f o r the p r iva te sector, pa r t icu la r ly f o r 
SMEs. 

39. 
Analytical wo r k carried out over the past years by the Bank has identified a 
number o f priority areas that appear to be bottlenecks limiting the country’s growth 
potential. These areas inc lude the need t o imp rove : (i) human cap i ta l pa r t icu la r ly as 
regards the labo r force; (ii) log is t ics 
in f ras t ruc tu re and services t o h e l p expo r t 
competitiveness; and (iii) the investment c l ima te . 

40. 
Despite the progress made o n the education front, the Salvadoran education 
system still has important gaps in secondary education. E l Salvador has made good 
progress in expanding access t o primary education. In 2007, 97 percent o f c h i l d r e n aged 
6- 1 1 we re en ro l led in p r im a r y school. Howeve r , with a n e t en ro l lmen t r a t i o in secondary 
educa t ion o f 59 percent in 2007,6 i t i s estimated that E l Salvador’s secondary en ro l lmen t 
i s m u c h l ow e r than tha t o f s im i la r m i d d l e income countries. These gaps are compounded 
by qua l i ty i s s u e s (e.g., student performance, as measured by standardized achievement 
tests, i s p o o r at the l ow e r secondary leve l ) w h i c h appear t o a f fec t pa r t icu la r ly the p o o r ( E l 
Sa lvado r , Pove r ty Assessment, Repo r t N o . 29594). F o r example, s i x t h graders p e r f o rm 
b e l ow the reg iona l average in eve ry subject area (mathematics, science, reading). These 
human cap i ta l issues place the coun t r y in a d is t inc t disadvantage in terms o f 
competitiveness as apart f r o m i t s d i rec t r o l e as a factor o f p roduc t ion , educa t ion and 
human cap i ta l determine the rate o f techno log ica l innova t ion in countries tha t p roduce 
techno logy and the rate o f techno log ica l abso rp t ion in countries tha t im i ta te it.

41. 
The new government plans to address these issues through a t w o pronged 
approach. O n the one hand i t i s reorganizing the Ministry o f Education and wo rk ing on a 
comprehensive strategy fo r the sector covering 2009-20 14. Priorities include imp rov ing 
the quality and coverage o f education and upgrading the professional standards o f 
teachers. E f fo r ts w i l l be made to better integrate’ science and technology across the 
curriculum (see next paragraph). O n the other hand, the government i s also wo rk ing to 
improve the human capital o f adults in the labor force through targeted training programs. 

42. 
The Ministry o f Education’s new organizational structure gives a prominent 
r o l e to the development o f science and technology education and research, including 
a focus on improving science education from pre-school to high school and training 
o f scientific and technological professionals. A reflection o f the government’s 
commitment i s the creation o f a position o f V ice Minister fo r Sc ience and Technology 
within the Ministry o f Education w i t h the mandate o f integrating the competitiveness 
agenda in the education system. This emphasis i s particularly welcome taking in to 
account E l Salvador’s relatively l o w ranking on the W o r l d Competitiveness Index (79 out 
o f 134 countries). The indicators on innovation and technological capacity tend to rank 
in the bo t tom quarter. 

43. 
Infrastructure has improved (particularly electricity and telecommunication) 
over the past few years but Salvadoran firms still find it expensive to produce and 
difficult to ship their output. According to the 2006 “ E l Salvador, Recent Developments 
in Infrastructure ” (Report N o . 37689) direct logistics costs fo r value-added goods- 
namely, t ruck ing service contracts, warehousing, and ocean borne shipping tariffs- 
remain a heavy and g row ing burden on Salvadoran producers. Moreover, indirect or 
“hidden” costs caused by delivery delays, lost, damaged and stolen cargo a re hu r t ing 
sales and directly affecting the competitiveness o f the country’s f i r m s . 
Infrastructure 
upgrades appear to be particularly needed in ru ra l areas and the government has indicated 
that this i s one o f i t s priorities. 

44. 
Attention i s also needed to some key determinants o f the Salvadoran 
investment climate. The 2007 L a t i n American and the Caribbean Regional Study 
Economic Performance 
in L a t i n America and the Caribbean: A Microeconomic 
Perspective (Report No . 407 17) reviewed the investment climate o f the region. The study 
found that the p roduc t iv i ty o f the Salvadoran f i r m s (and therefore the country’s g row th 
prospects) could be significantly enhanced by addressing the country’s h i g h crime rates 
wh ich in addition to negatively affecting the safety o f the f i r m s and i t s workers also 
impose costs (such as expenses on security). Similarly, the study also found that 
regulatory and institutional quality aspects were among the key e lemen ts that needed to 
be addressed to improve the country’s investment climate. 

B. Poverty Reduction and Soc ia l Sectors 

45. 
The main anti-poverty program in El Salvador has been the Red Solidaria, 
now renamed “Comunidades Solidarias Rurales”. This program i s designed to combat 
poverty in ru ra l areas through conditional cash t rans fe rs (CCT), p rov id ing cash t o poor 

13 

households based o n children’s regular health check-ups and school enrollment and 
attendance. Evaluations show the program i s fulfilling i t s objectives o f supporting the 
consumption o f poor ru ra l households. Moreover, the expansion o f t h i s program in rural 
areas has been accompanied b y significant increases in the ava i lab i l i ty o f pub l ic health 
and education services, thereby fac i l i ta t ing access t o and, u t i l iza t ion of, these services. 
Coverage o f t h e program reached 100 poo r mun ic ipa l i t ies as o f August 2009 (there i s a 
to ta l o f 262 municipalities in El Salvador). 

46. 
T h e r e i s cu r ren t ly no systematic app roach to social protect ion , a n d no 
specific mechan ism to address urban poverty . Th is i s pa r t icu la r ly important in the 

current environment, as the economic crisis i s expected to have a disproportionately 
higher impact in urban areas. Moreover, data indicate that the evo lu t ion o f remittances i s 
l i k e l y to resu l t in a larger reduction in urban centers than in ru ra l areas.’ Am o n g urban 
poor, you th a re particularly vulnerable. High you th unemployment rates and related l o w 
levels o f education and t ra in ing increase the i r susceptibility t o c r ime and violence. In 
response, the government i s wo rk ing towards a universal social p ro tec t ion system wh ich 
includes support fo r poo r urban households through new program called “Cornunidades 
Solidarias Urbanas. ’’ As part o f the enhanced social protection system, the government 
i s designing a short-term income protection p rog ram to mitigate j o b loss and income 
reduction du r ing the crisis fo l lowed b y a mo re systematic and permanent labor 
intermediation and qua i i f ica t ion system. 

47 . 

I n add i t ion t o strengthen ing social protect ion , the re i s also a need to address 

inequa l i t ies in school enrollments. Acco rd ing t o the F Y 0 7 L a t i n Ame r ican and the 
Caribbean Flagship, Poverty Reduction and G row th : Virtuous and Vicious Circles, 75 
percent o f Salvadoran ch i ld ren in the lowe r 3 deciles o f the income d is t r ibu t ion have l e s s 
than 6 years o f education. M o r e dramatically, about h a l f o f those have one o r less years 
o f education. At t h e other end, only 8 percent o f the poorest have 12 o r more years o f 
education. T h i s i s in contrast w i t h the higher three deciles o f t h e income d is t r ibu t ion 
where approximately 35 percent have 12 o r more years o f education. 

48 . 

E l Sa lvado r has m a d e good progress in t h e h e a l t h sector as changes in some 

hea l th ind ica to rs suggest. An example o f t h i s i s the reduction in the mo r ta l i ty rate o f 
ch i ld ren under five, from 30 to 19 per 1,000 live b i r ths between 2000 and 2007. 
Reductions o f similar magnitude have been reported f o r other health outcomes such as 
maternal mo r ta l i ty and infant ma lnu t r i t ion as w e l l as access t o health services. Many o f 
these achievements a re 
l i k e l y associated with improvements 
in socioeconomic 
infrastructure related t o l i v i n g conditions. T h i s progress notwithstanding, indicators based 
o n micro-data f r om 2004 and 2007 show that hea l th care u t i l iza t ion among ill people 
remained almost unchanged. O n the supply side, however, there are some notable 
changes, inc lud ing an ind ica t ion that the qua l i ty o f health services p rov ided by the 
systems as a whole has improved.8 

Estimates for 2007 indicate that as a percentage o f total volume received by households, 5 3 percent o f remittances go 
to urban areas versus 47 percent to rural. 
* The frac t ion o f hcalth care users ra t ing health services as excellent (or also good in urban areas) increased 
approximately by 3 percentage points. 

14 

49. 
Despite progress in recent years, El Salvador faces significant challenges in 
most social infrastructure categories, particularly in the poorest areas o f the 
country. The po l icy challenges identified in the 2006 report “El Salvador, Recent 
Developments i n In f ias t ruc tu re ” remain va l id today, inc lud ing the need to: address 
shortfalls in the provision o f basic infrastructure within severe fiscal constraints. The 
study found the water sector in particular to be performing far be low expectations. Water 
and sanitation has an important impact on l i v i n g conditions and health indicators and 
actions such as re-designing subsidies t o ensure the poor a re primary bene f ic ia r ies wou ld 
contribute to achieving the goal o f universal access to infrastructure. 

I 

50. 
I t i s important to safeguard the advances in health outcomes achieved ove r 
the last decade. Regional experience in Argentina, Peru and Mex ico has shown 
deterioration in some social indicators fo l low ing economic crisis. 
I t i s therefore 
important t o continue to improve the health system, particularly in times o f crisis, 
inc lud ing the efficiency and effectiveness o f spending on health systems. The 
government i s preparing an action p lan to achieve universal coverage, greater equity and 
enhanced quality through the creation o f an integrated network o f health ca re services. 
The current challenges wh ich need to be addressed relate to increasing access, 
particularly fo r vulnerable populations; reforming the structure and organization o f the 
health ca re system; developing human resources; re-enforcing gains acquired in recent 
years in disease prevention (e.g., dengue, H IV /A IDS , malaria etc.); and formulating a 
national drug po l icy . I t i s also important to strengthen epidemiological su rve i l lan ce , 
particularly in the context o f the H lN l epidemic. 

C . The Public Sector and Institutional Development 

5 1. 
The government intends to accelerate efforts to strengthen public financial 
management (PFM) and increase the transparency o f government spending. A 
recent assessment o f the current situation in El Salvador, sponsored by the European 
Commission in collaboration with the Bank and IDB, determined that the country’s P F M 
system possesses a number o f strengths, such as a sound legal and institutional 
framework fo r managing and mon i to r ing revenue and expenditure budgets, cash f lows 
and balances, and debt. In addition, the country’s integrated financial management 
system (SAFI), conceived no t on ly as a technological p la t fo rm but as a se t o f r u l e s , 
processes, and sk i l ls , has contributed to fiscal discipline and enabled greater transparency 
by a l low ing the timely issuance o f budget execution and other fiscal reports. 

52. Going forward, the agreed program focuses o n further strengthening o f 
public resource management with particular emphasis on expanding the PFM 
system, adhering to established international norms where appropriate, increasing 
the transparency of public spending (including procurement) and improving budget 
processes. In this latter regard, a key goal i s to move towards a medium-term and 
results-based budget framework, with an emphasis o n the “bottom-up” preparation o f 
costed strategic plans and ensuing investment programs, consistent with t h e “top-down” 
fiscal framework. O n the control side, the government has adopted international 

15 

standards (COS0 f ramewo rk ) and has put in place in te rna l regu la t ions t o fu r the r 
stimulate e f fec t ive ope ra t ion o f in te rna l con t ro l u n i t s in a l l p u b l i c ins t i tu t ions . 

Box 2. Governance and Anti-corruption in El Salvador 
E l Salvador has made important progress in developing i t s democratic institutions and overall governance 
fiamework. In the last 20 years, subsequent administrations have undertaken a se r ies o f structural reforms 
to stabilize the economy, open markets and trade, and modernize public sector institutions. These sustained 
reform efforts have succeeded in placing E l Salvador among the leading reformers in the L A C region 
according to indicators pu t for th in the D o i n g Business Report or the G lob a l Competitiveness Index . 
Similarly, governance indicators are also relatively positive such as the Wor ldw ide Governance Ind icators 
(WG I ) or the Transparency International Corrupt ion Percept ion Index (T I -CP I ) . 
Based on the Bank's assessment as we l l as several sources o f information and fo l low ing the L C R G A C 
Approach , the fo l low ing table summarizes the status o f progress and performance o f E l Salvador's country 
systems in 12 dimensions o f Governance and Anti-Corruption (GAC):

Likewise, the PEFA'' report has confirmed most o f these perceptions in a more systematic way and has 
revealed strengths and weaknesses o f existing Public Expenditure and Financial Management systems and 
practices. W h i l e the report recognizes the existence o f a robust legal fiamework, procedures and supporting 
instruments for the overall budgeting and financial management cycle, i t also flags the need for further 
strengthening particularly in two main areas: (i) the linkage between po l icy planning and budgeting; and 
( i i) the auditing and external control mechanisms and credibility. 

53 . 

Strengthening o f existing tax administration systems i s also critical in the 

current circumstances. A l t h o u g h the government has already made progress in 
enhancing the ove ra l l e f f i c i e n c y and effectiveness o f tax co l lec t ion mechanisms, there i s 

For example, the TI-CPI ranks E l Salvador in the 67 place among 180 countries and as t h e 3rd best perceived countries 
in LAC . The WG I ranks E l Salvador in the gth place i n the Government Effectiveness dimension among 17 LAC 
countries and i n the 4Ih place in the Control o f Corruption dimension.

s t i l l room fo r improvement. Further integration between the internal revenue and customs 
agencies i s an area o f opportunity that wou ld y ie ld significant return in t e rm s o f tax 
collection f r om a strengthened control system. Integration o f bo th control procedures and 
databases i s planned as a complement to tax po l icy measures to address the critical fiscal 
situation. 

54. 

Beyond improving expenditure management and controls and in recognition 
o f the importance of adequate and proactive disclosure, a number of actions a re 
planned to facilitate public dissemination of critical aspects o f public financial 
management. A state-of-the art public procurement dissemination too l (COMPRASAL ) 
has been successfully implemented and i s now recording and pub l ic iz ing a l l central 
government procurement activities 
inc lud ing b idd ing processes and contracts. 
COMPRASA L has allowed enhanced transparency and c red ib i l i ty o f public sector 
performance with respect to an area commonly perceived as most vulnerable to 
mismanagement and corruption. I t i s expected that the government w i l l further automate 
b idd ing processes and convert COMPRASAL in to a fu l ly transactional tool. The 
government i s also committed to revisit and adjust, as needed, the legal framework 
governing pub l ic procurement to promote greater transparency and enhance efficiency. 

5 5 . 

Further development o f the transparency and freedom o f information 
agenda i s deemed critical in view of existing negative perceptions and mistrust 
among other stakeholders, particularly members o f the legislature, the media and 
specialized non-government groups. The transparency and freedom o f pub l ic in fo rma t ion 
agenda has gained support among these groups and i t i s expected that, within the next 
two years, the government w i l l have established i t s normative framework and developed 
institutional capacity to make a l l public sector in fo rma t ion accessible to the public. 

D. Environment and Disaster Mitigation 

56. 

Environmental degradation i s a problem in El Salvador and increases its 
vulnerability to natural disasters. E l Salvador has the second highest economic risk 
exposure t o two o r more hazards, according to the W o r l d Bank funded Natural Disaster 
Hotspot study. l1 Due to i t s geographical location and geotectonic characteristics, El 
Salvador i s exposed to a variety o f natural hazards, and i s one o f the most seismically 
active regions o n earth. Na tu ra l disaster data f r om E l Salvador12 indicate 41 natural 
disaster even ts fo r the pe r iod 1982 to 2007, with to ta l economic damages estimated at 
US$4.57 b i 1 l i 0 n . l ~ The country i s also susceptible to climate change forces wh ich can 
exacerbate risk o f natural disasters.

57 . El Salvador faces severe degradation o f its natural resources, especially its 
natural forests, so i l , air quality, and water resources . On ly two pe rcen t o f i t s natural 
forests remain, which in the region compares only with Ha i t i . Yet, there i s evidence o f a 
significant recovery o f secondary forests and biodiversity, as reported b y ongoing studies. 
The health impact o f environmental degradation has been estimated at around 2.5 percent 
o f gross domestic product (GDP). Water po l lu t ion i s one o f the most pressing 
environmental problems that E l Salvador faces. Inadequate quantity and quality o f the 
potable water supply, sanitation facilities and practices, and hygiene conditions a re 
associated with various i l l n e s s e s in bo th adults and children. 

58 . 
These problems compromise El Salvador’s long-term economic growth, 
impose significant socioeconomic costs (particularly f o r vulnerable groups such as 
poor children), and have created a growing unmet demand in urban areas f o r 
adequate water supply, sanitation services, wastewater treatment, and clean and 
efficient public transport. F rom an environmental po l icy perspective, the challenge i s to 
strengthen environmental institutions and policies so that they effectively engage in 
territorial planning, protect the environment and t h e country’s natural heritage (avoiding 
unrealistic regulations 
that m igh t hinder competitiveness and investment) while 
supporting trade-driven g row th and a much needed expansion in infrastructure. 

IV . World Bank Group Strategy 

A. Lessons from the Last CAS (see also the CAS Completion Report) 

59. 

The Bank Group’s assistance over the four-year period covered by the 
previous CAS (FY05-08) envisaged a strategic program o f lending and non-lending 
activities to support the three main pillars o f the government’s development plan: (i) 
to accelerate broad-based, equitable economic growth and increase employment; (ii) to 
improve equity through bu i ld ing human capital and expanding access to socioeconomic 
infrastructure, assets and markets; and (iii) t o enhance security and reduce vulnerability 
inc lud ing support to governance and environmental agendas. 

60. 
During the CAS period, however, the political context evolved in such a way 
that, by the time the CAS Progress Report was prepared (in February 2008) several 
adjustments were made to the original targets and program. An impasse in the 
Na t iona l Assembly on several domestic issues led the opposition to b lock US$500 
m i l l i o n in new foreign bo r row ing requ i r ing a sovereign guarantee, inc lud ing f i v e Bank 
operations, as well as loans f r om the Central American Bank fo r Economic Integration 
(CABEI), the International Fund for Ag r icu l tu re Development (IFAD) and the IDB. The 
Bank operations were eventually cancelled after fa i l ing t o become effective within 18 
months o f Board approval. This setback in the implementation o f the CAS lending 
program led the Bank and the Government to adjust the assistance strategy by 
m in im iz ing the lending targets and emphasizing non-lending activities to prepare the r e - 
engagement fo r the new CAS cycle. 

18 

61. 
The CAS Completion Report found that in most cases anticipated projects 
went ahead under alternative financing arrangements, and progress was made 
towards CPS outcomes, although the pace of reforms did slow during the period. 
The ove ra l l objectives and coun t ry development goals set f o r t h in the o r ig ina l C A S 
rema ined va l id , but spec i f ic targets and C A S outcomes h a d t o be rev ised due t o the 
cance l la t ion o f several l e n d i n g activities. The Progress Repo r t also p roposed a stronger 
focus o n ana ly t ica l and adv iso ry services w h i c h also led t o pos i t ive C A S outcomes in the 
absence o f n ew lend ing . 

62 . An important lesson emerging from the CAS Completion report relates to 
the political polarization in El Salvador and the importance o f consensus-building 
efforts to ensure successful implementation of proposed programs. The 2005 C A S 
underestimated the imp l i ca t ions o f El Salvador’s d i v i d e d p o l i t i c a l env i ronmen t . Desp i te 
p roac t ive l o c a l outreach effort, i n c l u d i n g during the p ro jec t p repa ra t ion phase, the Bank’s 
loans became hostage t o p o l i t i c a l negotiations. W h i l e the expec ta t ion i s tha t the current 
s i tua t ion i s d i f fe ren t (see paragraph 97), the Bank intends t o manage th is risk by 
p resen t ing a package o f loans t o be approved by Congress w h i c h represent a ca re fu l ly 
selected p rog ram focused o n p r io r i t ies where there i s b road support. 
I t i s hoped that th is 
approach w i l l m i n im i z e the chance tha t i n d i v i d u a l loans are captured in a p o l i t i c a l debate 
and tha t Congress can agree o n a comprehensive approach and budge t f inanc ing t o 
address the crisis. The Bank w i l l o f course con t inue i t s consu l ta t ion e f fo r t s and elaborate 
an i n f o rm a t i o n and commun ica t ion strategy t o engage with the coun t r y leg is la t ive branch, 
p o l i t i c a l parties and other stakeholders, i n c l u d i n g l o c a l commun i t ies as appropriate. 

63. 
A second lesson i s the importance of analytical work to identify gaps in 
specific sectors, inform stakeholders and build consensus around important 
development issues. Expe r ience in E l Salvador has shown that the government values 
the Bank n o t o n l y as a lending fac i l i ty , but also f o r the range o f g loba l expertise i t can 
bring t o comp lex development issues. E v e n in the case whe re Bank p ro jec ts were n o t 
u l t im a t e l y app roved in Congress, the Bank con t inued i t s engagement in c r i t i c a l sectors 
th rough ana ly t ica l w o r k with a pos i t ive impac t . A n a l y t i c a l w o r k also prepared the 
g round f o r fu tu re engagement in areas o f m u t u a l interest. T h i s lesson i s also re levan t f o r 
areas where the gove rnmen t and the Bank m a y n o t agree o n a p o l i c y agenda o r need f o r 
financing, but where a con t inued engagement th rough ana ly t ica l w o r k i s use fu l t o sustain 
the dialogue. 

64. 
Finally, an important operational lesson emerging from the CAS Completion 
Report i s to carefully consider capacity and implementation issues early in the 
process o f project design. Fu tu re operations in E l Salvador must be designed based o n 
an assessment o f the capacity ava i lab le in the country, and with due cons ide ra t ion o f the 
coun t ry ’s p o l i t i c a l economy issues. C om p l e x i t y in design shou ld be reduced t o the ex ten t 
possible, and where i t i s not, clear p ro jec t imp lemen ta t ion p lans are needed be fo re the 
p ro jec t becomes e f fec t ive . This la t te r p o i n t i s pa r t icu la r ly re levan t in the current coun t ry 
circumstances characterized by the presence o f an inexpe r ienced adm in is t ra t ion tha t 
needs t o come up t o speed in the midst o f c r i t i c a l cond i t ions and t o create capacities 
w h i l e imp lemen t ing the in tended po l ic ies and programs.

65 . 

B. World Bank Country Partnership Program FY10-12 
The overall aim o f the CPS i s to support the government of El Salvador’s 
focus o n addressing poverty and inequality through three strategic objectives: (i) 
strengthen fundamentals f o r economic recovery by addressing macro and 
institutional vulnerabilities; (ii) strengthen social service delivery; and (iii) increase 
economic opportunities, particularly f o r the poor. Taking i n t o account lessons 

i d e n t i f i e d in the C A S C om p l e t i o n Report, th is CPS i s selective and focuses in areas 
where there i s clear comm i tmen t f r o m the government at va r ious levels. The ana ly t ica l 
w o r k i s designed t o be demand-driven and f l e x i b l e in order t o p rov ide jus t - in - t ime 
support t o the n ew l y elected government in p r i o r i t y areas. 

Principles of Engagement 

66. 

A strategic principle guiding the CPS i s to support the government’s 
approach of balancing the immediate response to the economic and social aspects o f 
the cr is is , while also beginning to respond to the longer-term development 

challenges. Recogn i z ing the imbalance be tween coun t r y needs and resources, and t o 
m a x im i z e the e f f ic iency o f the interventions, the gove rnmen t has requested tha t Bank 
assistance i s based o n this p r inc ip le . As such i t i s re f lec ted in the design o f the operations 
t o be de l ive red w h i c h inc lude shorter-term in te rven t ions but with a v i e w t o suppo r t ing 
longe r - te rm development. 

67. 
A second principle f o r this CPS includes selectivity and flexibility which i s in 
line with best practice in Middle Income Countries, and i s particularly necessary 
given the high degree o f uncertainty in terms o f the global economic outlook. A 

f l e x i b l e approach i s needed t o support the government as i t defines the l o n g t e rm 
government p r o g r am and w o r k s t o achieve p o l i t i c a l consensus. F l e x i b i l i t y w i l l also 
app ly t o the use o f ins t rumen ts , w h i c h inc lude a comb ina t ion o f development p o l i c y 
lending, inves tmen t lending, ana ly t ica l w o r k and techn ica l assistance t o support the 
government’s p o l i c y agenda and sustain dialogue during this c r i t i c a l pe r iod . 
In 
accordance with this p r inc ip le , the FY 10 l e n d i n g p rog ram i s we l l -de f ined and selective, 
howeve r the outer years o f the CPS w i l l be agreed with government based o n the 
e v o l u t i o n o f the coun t ry environment, and where the needs are mos t pressing. I f p o l i t i c a l 
po la r iza t ion shou ld become an issue, as i t did during the p rev ious CPS, the Bank w o u l d 
adjust i t s p rog ram t o achieve results th rough dialogue and AAA. 

68 . 

Lessons learned in the CAS Completion Report suggest successful programs 
require continuous consultation to secure broad support. T h i s p r i n c i p l e has been 

adopted b o t h f o r the p repa ra t ion o f the CPS and o n g o i n g w o r k p r o g r am discussions 
i n c l u d i n g o n spec i f ic operations. B r o a d consultations with re levan t stakeholders 
i n c l u d i n g p o l i t i c a l pa r t ies f r o m the oppos i t ion as w e l l as p r iva te sector representatives 
w o u l d alert t e am s o f po ten t ia l g r id lock and help des ign m i t i g a t i o n measures during 
p ro jec t preparation. In add i t ion t o the p ro jec t l e v e l consultation, the Bank w i l l sustain a 
permanent d ia logue with a l l p laye rs and m o n i t o r po ten t ia l r isks tha t c o u l d a f fec t the 
p rog ram .

70. Macro-stability and Expanding F isca l Space. T h e two - t ranche Pub l ic Finance 
and Social Sector (PFSS) D P L i s cen t ra l t o this ob jec t ive and w i l l help set the f ramewo r k 
f o r a possible f o l l ow - o n p rog ramma t ic DPL series. The PER under p repa ra t ion p rov ides 
analysis and recommendations in the areas o f f isca l management and ta rge t ing o f 
subsidies, and i s comp lemen ted by on-demand techn ica l assistance in deb t management 
and p u b l i c procurement t o op t im i ze the use o f scarce p u b l i c resources. The US$20 
m i l l i o n F isca l Management TAL accompany ing this CPS supports e f fo r t s t o enhance tax 
c o l l e c t i o n capabilities th rough strengthened con t ro ls and in teg ra t ion o f databases and 
procedures. The Sustaining Social Gains for Economic Recovery (SSGER) DPL, .also 
accompany ing this CPS extends the p o l i c y actions o f the PFSS DPL by suppo r t ing 
fu r the r actions t o reduce the cost o f other untargeted subsidies and re leas ing f isca l space 
f o r p ro tec t ing c r i t i c a l expenditures in the soc ia l sectors. G i v e n the f isca l challenges the 

21 

country i s facing, compounded with the natural disaster risk profile, the government may 
also consider the possibility o f a D P L with a Catastrophe De fe r red D rawdown Option 
(CAT DDO ) to provide a source o f immediately available liquidity during a state o f 
emergency caused by a natural disaster. 

71. 
P u b l i c Sec to r P e r f o r m a n c e and T r a n s p a r e n c y . The PFSS D P L supports 
enhancing pub l ic sector performance and transparency, as does the Fiscal Management 
and Public Sector Performance TAL, wh ich also accompanies this CPS. The T A L also 
contributes to resu l ts related to multi-year and performance-based budgeting, fiscal 
transparency and access t o information, e.g., imp rov ing E l Salvador’s ratings in selected 
PEFA indicators and increasing the number o f public sector procurement transactions 
recorded and disseminated through COMPRASAL . Trust Funds also support activities 
related to fiscal transparency and bu i ld ing fiscal management capacity. 

72. 
I n s t i t u t i o n a l S t reng then ing . Bu i ld ing institutional capacities and systems in 
c r i t ica l areas o f the public sector i s needed to strengthen fundamentals for economic 
recovery, but also to implement development policies more broadly. The TAL aims at 
strengthening capacity in several M in is t r ie s , inc lud ing the broader capacity to carry out 
po l icy planning and produce national statistics. 

O b j e c t i v e 2. S t r e n g t h e n d e l i v e r y o f soc ia l services 

73, 
P o v e r t y and Soc ia l P r o t e c t i o n . D raw ing f rom recent Bank analysis o f un fo ld ing 
income vulnerabilities and poverty impacts, the Bank i s wo rk ing w i t h the government to 
strengthen the institutional and policy-making capacity o f the government to develop 
medium t e r m social policies that target the .urban poor. The Income Support and 
Employability Project w i l l support strengthening the capacity in the government to design 
and implement inclusive social policies, particularly on social protection and 
employment. Through i t s labor market services, this Project also provides opportunities 
targeted to young under-employed men as well as to head-of-household women. 

74. 

The SSGER D P L also supports efforts to strengthen institutional capacity and 
po l icy making in the social sector l i n e Ministries and the Secretaria Te‘cnica de la 
Presidencia. B o t h these efforts w i l l contribute to the design o f a Universal Social 
Protection system to improve the targeting o f social assistance programs. A lso in the 
context o f the Income Support and Employability Project, the Bank i s helping the 
Government to design an income and j o b training program, the Flagship o f the 
Government’s Anti Crisis Plan, to limit income poverty impacts and improve poverty 
targeting in urban areas. W h i l e this program i s temporary, i t w i l l build capacity to 
respond to future shocks. 

75 . 

H e a l t h and E d u c a t i o n . The SSGER D P L promotes po l i cy actions in c r i t ica l 
areas to protect the most vulnerable population and has helped establish a strong dialogue 
across government, inc lud ing health and education ministries. A possible fo l low -on D P L 
se r ies along with specific investment operations are likely to provide continuity fo r Bank 
support to key social sector reforms. Ongoing Bank projects and AAA (such as the 

22 

Pharmaceutical Study and Income Vulnerabilities and Poverty Note) also support 
outcomes related to protecting and enhancing coverage o f basic health services. The 
US$143 m i l l i o n Hospital Reconstruction and Basic Hea l th Se rv i ce s Project has been 
supporting the government’s efforts to expand primary health care coverage to more than 
500,000 additional households using the targeting criteria se t by the Red So l ida r ia design. 
Bu i ld ing up on i t s experience in other countries, IFC w i l l seek opportunities in te r t ia ry 
education areas where access to lower segments o f the population could be expanded in a 
sustainable manner. 

7 6 . 

C r i m e and V io lence . W h i l e there are limitations in t e r n s o f Bank interventions 
in this area, i t remains an important country and regional concern and the Bank i s able to 
assist the government in a number o f important components o f this agenda. B o x 1 draws 
on recently completed analytical wo rk and suggests efforts a r e needed t o address social 
inequality and i s s u e s related to youth, unemployment, poverty, and education. Fo r 
instance, the Income Support and Employability Project supports activities to address 
crime and violence through temporary income support and improved labor market 
services in poor municipalities where crime and violence are pronounced, and where 
dwe l l ing improvements and pub l ic safety initiatives are also taking place. l4 Youth- 
targeted activities include a JSDF grant to address youth violence through cultural 
programs and learning. 

O b j e c t i v e 3. I n c r e a s e econom ic o p p o r t u n i t i e s , p a r t i c u l a r l y f o r t h e p o o r 

77 . 

J o b C r e a t i o n . Bu i ld ing on recent analytical work, the Bank w i l l support the 
government’s efforts to mitigate the current labor impact o f the crisis, and also enhance 
employment opportunities in the medium-term. A l though designed to respond to 
temporary social needs, the Income Support and Emp loyab i l i ty Project w i l l include 
longer-term interventions to help create a labor force intermediation and qualification 
system and develop institutional capacity at the loca l and national level. The operation 
wou ld also support efforts to strengthen the capacity to manage labor markets through 
bu i ld ing training capacity and p rov id ing institutional support, inc lud ing through loca l 
employment offices which are not currently able t o respond to po l icy strategy. Increasing 
employment 
i s also 
the 
IFC ’s p r inc ipa l strategic objective 
in E l Salvador. 
Complementing investment operations, IFC w i l l continue to support strengthening the 
investment climate, as i t i s currently doing through a business licensing (registration, 
construction and operation) simplification project at the mun ic ipa l leve l . I t w i l l also seek 
to leverage synergies with the Bank. 

78. 

Sc ience and T e c h n o l o g y . One significant expected outcome o f the institutional 
strengthening supported through the SSGER D P L i s an assessment o f the relevance and 
quality o f science and technology curriculum and teaching, particularly at the secondary 
education level. The Bank expects to remain engaged through analytical wo rk and 
possible lending t o support medium-term po l icy measures to improve sc ience and 
technology education and innovation. 

l4 

The government identified these municipalities through a targeting instrument based on an urban 
poverty map and additional information on crime. 

23 

79 . 
R u r a l Infrastructure. The government i s in teres ted in a more strategic and 
decentralized approach to rural development and has requested Bank support fo r a ru ra l 
infrastructure and development project focused on the provision o f basic infrastructure 
and financing fo r income-generating activities. This project i s being designed to help 
address the impact o f the crisis b y creating employment and support pub l ic investment in 
ru ra l areas in order to improve competitiveness in the longer te rm , inc lud ing a more 
market-oriented approach to ru ra l development, capitalizing o n C A F T A opportunities.’ 

80. 
Financial Sector. IFC’s financial sector strategy w i l l remain closely focused on 
MSME financing and in meeting the needs o f underserved populations. I FC w i l l use 
established loan wholesaling programs w i t h loca l banks to support these groups, as well 
as developing new financial products to meet their needs. In addition, I FC intends to 
maintain i t s support fo r the expansion o f E l Salvador-based corporates, especially those 
able t o integrate SMEs in to their operations or have an impact on low-income groups. 
The Government has also requested a Financial Sector Assessment (FSAP) to help 
identify potential risks and opportunities affecting the financial sector in the current 
circumstances. A small Bank Trust Fund supports imp rov ing Corporate Financial 
reporting. 

8 1. 
Infrastructure. 
IFC’s 
infrastructure investments w i l l be concentrated o n 
imp rov ing E l Salvador’s logistics and power supply. A c t i v i t y in logistics includes 
upgrading the highway network, po r t system, and energy supplies-notably o f renewable 
energy sources such as hydropower. 
In addition, IFC’s Adv iso ry Services arm has 
opened an o f f ice in San Salvador f rom wh ich i t w i l l coordinate Investment Climate 
operations regionally. Beyond the Ru ra l Infrastructure and Loca l Development Project, 
there may be i n t e r e s t during the CPS period fo r additional infrastructure projects. 

82. 
Potential IFC investments would support CPS outcomes related t o creating 
econom ic opportunities. Currently I FC plans to focus on: (i) renewable energy projects 
and (ii) supporting loca l companies in the real sector with expansion plans and/or a 
regional footprint. I FC i s considering a se r ies o f investments in the agribusiness, 
fertilizer, commercial real estate development, and waste managemenuenergy generation 
that fit the country strategy. Opportunities fo r collaboration w i t h the Bank include 
awarding an operating concession fo r the po r t o f L a U n i 6 n and supporting the design o f 
private-public partnership (PPP) solutions t o carry out spec i f ic initiatives in the health 
industry and fo r urban infrastructure and massive transportation in the metropolitan area 
o f San Salvador. In the power sector, I FC expects to build on the j o i n t Central America 
energy strategy developed with the Bank. 

83. 
The Bank i s also preparing several p ieces o f regional analytical wo rk which 
w i l l be relevant f o r El Salvador, particularly in terms o f creating opportunities f o r 
broad-based economic growth. Studies are under preparation at this time in the 
fo l low ing areas: (i) enhancing regional competitiveness; (ii) the C A F T A complementary 

Is As this project i s in the early stage o f preparation there a re currently no outcomes included in the Results 
Framework, however i t i s expected that these would be added at the time o f the Progress Report. 

24 

agenda; (iii) regional energy opportunities; (iv) creating conditions fo r employment 
generation; (v) pharmaceuticals; and (vi) addressing crime and violence i s s u e s in the sub- 
region. E l Salvador i s also participating in a regional project on Remittance P r ic ing 
database wh i ch could support efforts to channel a larger po r t ion o f remittances in to the 
economy. The Bank i s prepared to provide hrther support in these areas should the 
Government reques t it. The dissemination o f these studies may lead to fo l low -up at the 
country leve l . Du r ing the CPS cycle, the Bank also expects to provide specific po l i cy 
advice fo r E l Salvador o n enhancing competitiveness and economic recovery fo l low ing 
the crisis. 

84. 

Proposed Program of Support 
Implementation o f the ongoing portfolio supports the strategic objectives o f 
the CPS. The current Bank’s po r t fo l io in E l Salvador includes a Development Po l icy 
Loan (US$450 million), two investment operations nearing project completion (US$16 1 
m i l l ion ) and a GEF grant (US$5 m i l l ion ) . The two ongoing investment operations are 
rated moderately satisfactory mos t ly due to the slow pace o f implementation, wh ich i s 
common during election transitions. The current undisbursed balance i s US$286 m i l l i o n 
wh ich r e f l e c t s p r ima r i l y the undisbursed balance o f the D P L (US$250 m i l l ion ) . The 
Bank has a small po r t fo l io (US$2.5 m i l l ion ) o f Trust Funds under implementation (see 
Annex 5) wh ich supports ongoing projects and those proposed in the CPS. 

85 . 

The indicative envelope f o r the CPS period FY10-FY12 i s estimated at 
US$650 million, and i s expected to include a mix of investment and DPL lending. 
Three operations accompany this CPS: a U S $ l 00 m i l l i o n Sustaining Social Gains for 
Economic Recovery D P L , a US$50 m i l l i o n Income Support and Employability Project, 
and a US$20 m i l l i o n F isca l Management and Pub l ic Sector Development TA.

The proposed three-year period i s deemed appropriate given the uncertain 
circumstances related to the global environment and the economic situation in the 
U S in particular which factors prominently in El Salvador’s economic prospects. 
Wh i le the CPS does no t cover the en t i re 5 year po l i t ica l cycle i t w i l l cover roughly h a l f o f 
the new Government’s potential tenu re and a l low the CPS to be flexible enough to 
address the current challenges noted in the An t i -C r is is Plan and respond qu ick ly to the 
evolving medium-term agenda. The Progress Report w i l l provide an opportunity fo r 
adjustments as needed. 
Programming f o r the outer years o f the CPS will be flexible. Ea r ly indications 
fo l low ing discussions with government suggest possible f u t u r e lending wou ld support 
areas under the th ree strategic objectives, and include possible financing fo r the health 

87.

sector, urban infrastructure, and higher education. I t i s anticipated that possible f u t u r e 
D P L lending w i l l r e f l e c t a certain leve l o f continuity with the areas supported by the 
PFSS and SSGER DPLs : (i) fiscal reform; (ii) public sector management; and (iii) 
imp rov ing social sector se rv ice delivery and protecting vulnerable populations. The 
indicative envelope fo r FY 1 1 - 12 i s US$400 m i l l ion . The actual allocation fo r outer years 
w i l l be agreed on the basis o f the identification o f specific p r io r i ty operations, assessment 
o f the country’s absorption capacity and i s subject to the availability o f IBRD funds. 

88. 
The proposed program o f analytical and advisory serv ices w i l l facilitate both 
maintaining engagement in p r io r i ty areas while at the same time generating 
necessary analytical foundations to facilitate preparation o f new lending operations. 
Ongoing and recently completed analytical wo rk w i l l be used t o stimulate discussion w i t h 
a broad range o f stakeholders as the government articulates the country’s National 
Development Plan. 
I t w i l l also se rve as a strong underpinning for future lending, 
inc lud ing Development Po l icy Lending. Finally, in l i n e with the CASCR findings, M A 
has proven t o be an effective instrument in E l Salvador in t e rm s o f achieving resu l ts . 

89. 
The Bank w i l l also continue to provide policy and technical advice in the 
growing Global Public Goods agenda, where the Bank has a comparative 
advantage. For example, climate change i s o f h i g h concern fo r E l Salvador because o f 
their vulnerability t o natural disasters wh ich i s expected to increase. E l Salvador i s a 
participant in the Bank-led Forest Carbon Partnership Facility, which aims to achieve 
Reduced Emissions f r om Deforestation and Degradation (REDD). Similarly, government 
in te res t in a C A T D D O and possible infrastructure projects cou ld be an en t ry po in t fo r 
discussions on environmental management. The Country Environmental Assessment 
(CEA), completed in FY08 also remains valid. T h e Bank i s also p rov id ing A M support 
for disaster management through CAPRA (see B o x 3).

90. 
The government has also expressed a strong in te res t in Bank technical 
assistance. The Bank w i l l be responsive to government needs and seek to provide just- 
in-time advice on reques t . Some areas where the government has expressed an in te res t 
include procurement and pub l ic f inance management, and as mentioned above in the 

26 

development o f the Na t iona l Development Plan. In l i n e with the approach taken fo r 
lending operations and AAA, the CPS adopts a flexible approach to respond to 
government priorities. Trust Funds w i l l be sought to leverage CPS activities and enhance 
their impact. 
C. Development Partners 
9 1 . 
The Country Partnership strategy i s coordinated with El Salvador’s other 
development partners, notably the IDB. This CPS was prepared in close coordination 
with the IDB and government to ensure an e f f i c i e n t d iv is ion o f labor based on 
comparative advantage. 
In human development the Bank w i l l t a k e a lead role in 
education and health, and IDB has a regional operation focusing on medicines. In the 
area o f social protection bo th the Bank and IDB w i l l be involved, but the Bank w i l l focus 
i t s efforts o n the design o f essential components o f a universal social protection system. 
IDB i s likely to remain engaged in the infrastructure sectors. There i s strong 
coordination with IDB o n P F M issues, inc lud ing supporting efforts to improve the fiscal 
situation. Past experience shows the value o f some j o i n t activities (e.g., j o i n t PER and 
CAPRA Initiative) and during the CPS period the Bank w i l l continue to wo rk with IDB 
to identify areas fo r possible collaboration. In parallel to the CPS consultation process, 
the Bank held a meeting w i t h development partners to discuss the proposed Bank 
program, as w e l l as opportunities to establish specific channels fo r donor coordination. 

92 . 
The Government has taken the lead in promoting division o f labor among 
donors in line with development needs. In l i g h t o f the financing needs arising f rom the 
international economic crisis wo rk ing with donors has become increasingly important fo r 
E l Salvador. The ma in multilateral partners a re CABE I , the IDB, the European 
Commission (EC), the UN agencies and the W o r l d Bank. B i la te ra l agencies l i k e USAID, 
J ICA (Japan) and A E C I (Spain) continue to provide support in the country. The 
Millennium Challenge Corporation i s funding a transportation project in the N o r t h o f the 
country. The Bank i s wo rk ing with UN agencies closely, in particular in the preparation 
o f the urban employment program. The donor community plans to establish regular 
meetings with other partners to improve coordination efforts, reduce duplication and to 
promote the design complementary programs. There are very few external partners active 
in E l Salvador wh i ch should facilitate donor coordination and d iv is ion o f labor. 

93 . 
The Bank has been collaborating closely with the IMF. A workshop was 
organized j o i n t l y by the Bank and the IDB and IMF in M a y 2009 , before the new 
government took o f f ice in order t o discuss possible areas o f support. These coordination 
efforts have continued since then and consultation w i t h the IMF has been particularly 
close in the context o f preparing the rev iew o f macroeconomic development and in the 
update o f the Debt Sustainability Analysis. L o o k i n g forward the Bank w i l l continue to 
wo rk with the IMF particularly in the context o f the tax reforms being currently 
considered by the administration. 

27 

D. CPS Consultations 
94. 
During the week of August 17, 2009 , the Bank held a se r ies of CPS 
consultations. Participants included NGOs, think t a n k s , universities, the media, private 
sector representatives and members o f Congress. Stakeholders were broadly supportive 
o f the focus o f the Bank program and the Bank’s relevance in E l Salvador. Many agreed 
w i t h the flexible nature o f the CPS, particularly in l igh t o f the current environment and 
given that a longer-term national strategy i s not yet clearly articulated. At the same time, 
participants raised some priorities fo r the Bank t o consider, inc lud ing concerns regarding 
the impact o f the c r i s i s on poverty, unemployment and security; the severity o f fiscal 
constraints and the implications fo r longer-term debt sustainability; and h o w the country 
could sustain higher rates o f g row th in the fu ture . Stakeholders were also particularly 
concerned about the increasing l e v e l s o f crime and violence in E l Salvador. Participants 
o f the CPS process were asked to complete a brief survey t o solicit feedback, and these 
discussions were supplemented by a web-based consultation process. M o s t respondents 
found the Bank had an important ro le to play in E l Salvador. 

V. R i s k s and Mitigation 
95 . On the macroeconomic front, the main risks derive from the global financial 
c r is is and more specifically from a deep and prolonged global deceleration. The 
current global situation i s negatively impacting E l Salvador as credit to the private sector 
becomes tighter, remittances and foreign direct investment decrease, and the U S demand 
for Salvadoran products declines. W h i l e these factors have been taken in to account in the 
preparation o f the CPS, t o the extent that the global slowdown lasts longer o r i s deeper 
than anticipated, the government may find some d i f f icu l t ies implementing i t s program. In 
particular, there i s a risk to the fiscal situation i f tax collection does no t recuperate as 
qu ick ly as predicted. The Bank w i l l maintain actively engaged through development 
po l icy lending. 

96. A critical element behind the efforts to mitigate macroeconomic risks i s 
related to the need to find f isca l space to address the country’s emerging needs and 
also maintain a sustainable fiscal policy stance. On the social front, the expansion o f 
social protection programs i s expected to mitigate some o f the risks by imp rov ing income 
prospects fo r the poorest. R is ing unemployment may exacerbate the p rob lem o f c r ime 
and violence wh ich could also increase social and economic costs and negatively impact 
institutions. The strong focus in the CPS o f addressing inequality and focusing on j o b 
creation, particularly fo r youth in urban areas, aims in part to mitigate this risk. 

97. 

The highly polarized political climate in El Salvador could affect program 
implementation. A l though the recent presidential elections suggest a consensus on the 
need fo r a greater focus on policies to stimulate growth, reduce unemployment, improve 
revenues and address the needs o f the most vulnerable segments o f the population, the 
government w i l l face po l i t i ca l challenges in creating a consensus on future economic 
policies. The recent history, inc lud ing the approval o f the Bank and IDB loans in late 
2008 and agreement on the appointment o f the Supreme Court justice fo r example, 
indicate that there i s room fo r collaboration in the current environment. The Government 

28 

and the Bank recognize the need f o r e f fec t ive d ia logue and consensus-building processes, 
i n c l u d i n g invo lvemen t o f the oppos i t ion in defining f isca l p r i o r i t i e s and the oppo r tun i ty 
t o commen t o n p ro jec t design. The Bank m a y h e l p by p r o v i d i n g techn ica l input t o the 
economic debate and engag ing in p o l i c y dialogue with stakeholders. 

9 8 . 

CPS implementation i s also susceptible to r i s k s deriving from natural 
disasters, to which El Salvador i s subject by virtue o f its geographic location. As 
with other Cen t ra l Am e r i c a n countries, E l Salvador i s highly vu lne rab le t o multiple 
na tu ra l disasters r isks -floods, hurricanes and earthquakes. A m a j o r c l ima t ic o r seismic 
disaster wou ld , o f course, pose a s ign i f ican t threat t o econom ic g r ow t h and f isca l s tab i l i ty 
and c o u l d also delay the government’s p rog ram i n c l u d i n g the need t o d ive r t a l loca t ion o f 
funding t o support emergency related efforts. Gove rnmen t focus o n soc ia l protection, in 
r u r a l and urban areas, i s in tended in part t o h e l p the popu la t ion ’s mos t vulnerable 
segments better withstand th is recu r r ing shocks. 

99 . 
Finally, CPS implementation could be also affected by limited institutional 
capacity. The cu r ren t government i s a new adm in is t ra t ion with n o p rev ious executive 
experience. T h e gove rnmen t w i l l need t im e t o develop necessary imp lemen ta t ion 
capabilities. The Bank p rog ram envisages techn ica l support and t ra in ing as part o f the 
p repa ra t ion o f a l l p roposed engagements t o strengthen abso rp t ion capacity. S t i l l , rea l is t ic 
timeframes and ou tcome p ro jec t ions w i l l need t o be considered in the p repa ra t ion o f a l l 
proposed ac t iv i t ies .

El Salvador 
FY05-08 (extended to FY09 )

Introduction 

The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) f o r El Salvador, covering the period FY05 to 
FYOS, was discussed in January 2005. The CAS aimed to support the Government’s 
development p lan “Safe Country 2004-2009”, and envisaged a strategic program o f lending and 
non-lending activities, including: (i) a se r ies o f programmatic Development Po l icy Lend ing loans 
(US$300 m i l l i o n total), the f i r s t o f wh i ch was considered by the Board at the time o f the CAS 
discussion; (ii) six investment operations (US$185 m i l l i o n total); (iii) several Ana ly t ica l and 
Adv iso ry Activities (AAA), and technical assistance; and (iv) targeted private sector assistance 
provided by I FC and MIGA. 

However, the CAS program evolved substantially as political and economic events 
unfolded. Even though President An ton io Saca had w o n the presidential election o f 2004 with a 
so l id ma rg in o f 58 percen t o f the vote (to 38 percent fo r i t nearest rival), E l Salvador’s po l i t ica l 
environment was characterized by a h i g h leve l o f polarization. Moreover, power in the Na t iona l 
Assembly remained divided between the r u l i n g Na t iona l Republic A l l iance Party (ARENA) and 
the Farabundo Marti Na t iona l L ibe ra t ion F ron t Party (FMLN), g iv ing the latter the poss ib i l i ty to 
b lock the passage o f items requiring a two-thirds majority, such as foreign loans requiring a 
sovereign guarantee. 

I n the initial phase following Board discussion o f the CAS, the Bank proceeded to prepare 
and present to the Board five operations totaling US$265 million between February and 
December 2005: (i) Environmental Services; (ii) Excellence and Innova t ion o f Secondary 
Education; (iii) Social Protection and Loca l Development; (iv) Land Administration; and (v) the 
Second Broad Based G row th Development Po l icy Lending. 

Yet, Bank-approved operations were soon to become pawns in the National Assembly. 
Indeed, an impasse in the Na t iona l Assembly o n several domestic is sue s led the opposition to 
b lock US$SOO m i l l i o n in new foreign borrowing, inc lud ing the f ive W o r l d Bank operations 
mentioned above, as w e l l as loans f rom the Central American Bank fo r Economic Integration 
(CABEI), the International Fund fo r Ag r icu l tu ra l Development (IFAD) and the Inter American 
Development Bank. The Bank operations were eventually cancelled after fa i l ing to become 
effective within 18 months f r om Board approval. 

This setback in the implementation o f the CAS lending program led the Bank and the 
Government to reassess the assistance strategy in late 2007. The shift in the assistance 
strategy was formalized through the CAS Progress Report in February 2008 when, besides the 
five cancelled operations, tw o other lending operations were dropped f r om the o r ig ina l pipeline.

E l Sa lvado r C o u n t r y P a r t n e r s h i p S t r a t e g y FY05-FY09- C o m p l e t i o n R e p o r t 

The Progress Repo r t inc luded a s e t o f rev ised outcomes and greater focus o n AAA and non - 
lend ing techn ica l assistance (TA). I t also extended the C A S coverage pe r iod by one year, 
th rough FY09 , t o co inc ide with the coun t ry ’s p o l i t i c a l cycle. Desp i te the fac t that the Bank was 
unab le t o imp lemen t i t s lend ing program, i t rema ined s t rong ly engaged th rough non - lend ing and 
techn ica l assistance w h i c h we re highly va lued by the Government. 

The continued engagement of the Bank resulted in new lending towards the end o f the CAS 
period (late 2008) when fiscal pressures emerged in the context o f the global financial c r is is . 
Mo reove r , in add i t ion t o the increasing amount o f outstanding sho r t - te rm debt tha t needed t o be 
r o l l e d ove r in a con tex t o f tight c red i t markets (bo th domestic and international), the med ium - 
t e rm f isca l s i tua t ion was fu r the r comp l ica ted by the need t o amo r t ize a b o n d series in 201 1 that 
w o u l d mo re than doub le the country’s debt service tha t year. Aga ins t this backg round the 
Gove rnmen t reached ou t t o the oppos i t ion party which, f o r the f i r s t time in the las t 20 years had 
reasonable chances o f winning the p res iden t ia l elections scheduled f o r M a r c h 2009 (and 
even tua l ly won). This created a series o f incentives f o r b o t h ARENA and the FMLN t o j o i n t l y 
address the country’s f inanc ing needs th rough mu l t i la te ra l budget support, w h i c h in the case o f 
the Bank t o o k the fo rm o f a D P L . A l t h o u g h n o t p lanned at the t im e o f the Progress Report, the 
new Bank - f inanced DPL was consistent with the Bank’s response t o support several countries in 
the R e g i o n w h o were fac ing s im i la r challenges. The D P L was app roved in January 2009 and has 
disbursed i t s first tranche. 

The Government Strategy 

El Salvador has long been recognized as a regional leader in the implementation o f 
economic reforms. Since the ea r ly 1 9 9 0 ’ ~ ~ 
the coun t ry has tack led a numbe r o f k e y challenges 
i n c l u d i n g trade l ibe ra l iza t ion , tax reform, f inanc ia l sector strengthening, and p r om o t i o n o f 
p r iva te pa r t ic ipa t ion in telecoms, energy, and pensions. O n the soc ia l front, the coun t ry also 
increased the resources devo ted t o schooling, hea l th and other basic services. 
I n spite of these key improvements, several key challenges remained, at the time o f CAS 
. Economic performance. A l t h o u g h El Salvador h a d gene ra l ly ma in ta ined a s o l i d 
preparation, with the po ten t ia l t o s low d o w n o r reverse progress: 
t rack reco rd o f mac roeconom ic p o l i c y since the end o f the c i v i l war, the f isca l 
accounts h a d started t o deteriorate and the current account d e f i c i t was o n the r i s e . 
Governance. Fu r the r e f fo r ts t o mode rn ize the p u b l i c sector were s t i l l requ i red t o 
im p r o v e the e f f ic iency and transparency o f p u b l i c ins t i tu t ions . 
Growth. Several areas c r i t i c a l t o g r ow t h needed further imp rovemen t , such as: trade, 
investment climate, infrastructure, and the ove ra l l educational l e v e l o f the popu la t ion . 
Poverty. Desp i te s ign i f ican t progress since the 1 9 9 0 ’ ~ ~ 
reg iona l and spatial 
dimensions o f pove r ty rema ined impo r tan t . 
Vulnerability to external shocks. N a t u r a l disaster o r un favo rab le ex te rna l economic 
developments can have a s ign i f ican t adverse impact, lead ing t o decelerating g r ow t h 
levels.

Crime and Violence. This was a c r i t ica l issue, w i t h significant economic, social 
welfare, health and governance impacts. Persistently h i g h levels o f crime and 
violence affect the investment climate, undermine social capital and erode the assets 
and incomes o f the poor. 

. 

Political polarization and lack o f national consensus. The d iv is ion o f power 

be tween the two lead pa r t ie s 
increased transaction costs fo r the Executive, 
introducing some degree o f uncertainty and slowing down the re fo rm process. 

The Government's "Safe Country 2004-2009" development plan aimed to address these 

challenges. The Government plan, summarized in Annex 1, was articulated in th ree ma in 
p i l la rs : (i) accelerating broad-based growth; (ii) imp rov ing equity and bu i ld ing human capital; 
and (iii) enhancing security and reducing vulnerability. When financing f rom the multilaterals 
failed to receive approval f rom the Na t iona l Assembly, the Government sought and secured 
alternate sources o f financing that did no t require a qualified ma jo r i ty in Congress (e.g., the 
issuance o f short-term bonds or reliance on the Pension Trust or bilateral suppok in the fo rm o f 
grants) to implement i t s development plan albeit at a slower pace and at a higher cost than 
anticipated. 

The Government development plan was adjusted in 2008 to face the social impact of the 
food and o i l price c r i s i s as well as the economic impact of the global crisis. E l Salvador's 

strategy to protect vulnerable households f r om the impact o f h i g h commodity prices relied on the 
expansion o f the existing safety net, reduction o f impo r t t a r i f f s fo r selective agricultural goods, 
support fo r agricultural production, and increases in transport subsidies. The Government also 
strengthened the mon i to r ing o f the financial sector to be able to react to any potential problem in 
the banking sector in the context o f the global financial crisis, and negotiated access to long-term 
multilateral financing. Mu l t i la te ra l support came as a package inc lud ing a US$SOO m i l l i o n 
precautionary Standby Agreement f rom the IMF, a US$500 m i l l i o n budget support loan and a 
US$400 m i l l i o n operation under the L i q u i d i t y P r o g r am for G r ow t h Sus ta inab i l i ty f rom the 
IDB, and a US$450 m i l l i o n Public Finance and Social Sector Development Po l icy Loan (DPL) 
f r om the W o r l d Bank. 

Results achieved and Progress towards Country Development Goals 

&ogress towards Country Development Goals 

A l though po l i t ica l developments during the CAS pe r iod weakened the Government's ab i l i ty to 
advance i t s po l icy agenda in the Na t iona l Assembly, E l Salvador made much progress in 
achieving country development goals which remain re levan t today. 

The macroeconomic environment improved between 2005 and 2008. The Government 

maintained a sound macroeconomic framework du r ing the o r ig ina l CAS period, and over the 
pe r iod 2005-2009 economic growth steadily imp roved reaching 4.2 percent in 2006 and 
4.7 percent in 2007. A l though slightly be low the Central American average, the economy was 
g row ing at double i t s historical levels in the pe r iod 2005-2007. This improvement reflects an 
increase in broad economic activity since the end o f 2005, driven by stronger performance in the 
tourism, non-traditional agriculture, construction, financial and transport sectors. Foreign direct 

Page I 36 

E l Salvador Coun t ry Pa r tne rsh ip Strategy FY05-FY09- Comp le t ion Repo r t 

investment and non-traditional exports also showed positive trends. Some progress was also 
made in stabilizing the non-financial pub l ic sector debt through reducing spending and 
increasing 
tax 
revenues . Notwithstanding progress 
in structural 
reforms and sound 
macroeconomic management, growth decreased to 2.5 percen t in 2008, reflecting a decline in 
export performance, a tightening o f domestic credit markets and a slowdown in remittances and 
foreign direct investment, due to the global financial c r i s i s . 

El Salvador’s relatively strong economic performance was accompanied by important 
socioeconomic progress and reductions in poverty (from 43.6% in 2001 to 35.5% in 2007). 
Access to basic services, inc lud ing safe water and sanitation has increased; and core health 
outcomes, such as l i f e expectancy, infant and child mortality, and c h i l d nu t r i t ion have a l l 
improved. In several areas, inc lud ing in basic education, infant mortality, and access to potable 
water, the gaps between the poor and the non-poor have also declined over the period. The 
Government also designed and implemented a national strategy fo r a more effective social 
protection program which targeted poor households in ru ra l areas. 

El Salvador continued to make progress in its governance agenda, particularly in the 
public sector through improvements in public financial management and control tools. 
Acco rd ing to a recent Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Assessment, 
P F M functions in E l Salvador a re reasonably well-developed and rank above the L A C regional 
average. Du r ing the CAS period further progress was also made in strengthening internal 
controls through the expansion o f the Integrated Financial Management System (SAFI). E l 
Salvador’s ranks relatively well in D o i n g Bus iness (#72 in 2009 DB up f r om #77 in 2008 DB). 
W h i l e indicators related to Starting a Bus iness improved significantly, in some areas ratings have 
remained stagnant and more wo rk may be needed. 

Overview of Results Delivered by the CASp rog ram 

In t e rm s o f W o r l d Bank contribution, as discussed in paragraph 5 , a substantially revised W o r l d 
Bank program and outcomes were established in the CAS Progress Report to respond to 
developments o n the ground and the inab i l i ty to lend in the new po l i t ica l environment. The CAS 
Completion Report finds the resu l ts were satisfactory fo r a l l th ree pillars, with stronger resu l ts in 
Pillars I and 111. The fo l low ing sections provide an assessment o f progress in each o f the th ree 
pillars. Specific indicators and further detail on CAS outcomes and progress towards long-term 
development goals are included in Annex 2 . 

Pillar I: Accelerating Broad-based Growth and Increasinp EmDlovment 

The Country Development Goal under the f i r s t pillar was to provide a foundation fo r an 
accelerated broad-based growth path by fostering trade openness, imp rov ing the investment 
climate, and maintaining a sound macroeconomic framework. The Government achieved a l l the 
CAS outcomes under this pillar. However, the expected growth and employment bene f i ts have 
been overtaken by the effects o f the global financial c r i s is . 

Over the CAS period significant progress was made o n the trade and investment climate 
fronts. E l Salvador was the first country in Central America to begin full implementation o f the 
DR -CAFTA Treaty in mid-2006. The CAS outcomes in this area were the approval by the

C A F T A provisions in 2005, and the Ma rch 2006 ra t i f ica t ion o f the DR -CAFTA . Similarly, El 
Salvador has greatly improved i t s overall investment climate b y s imp l i f y ing regulations and 
facilitating most c r i t ica l requirements to s ta r t and close businesses, access financing, and enforce 
contracts. Bo th CAS outcomes in this area were exceeded, Le., the cost to s ta r t a business as a 
percentage o f income per capita f e l l f rom 128 percent in 2004 to 49.6 percent in 2009, and the 
number o f days needed to s t a r t a business f e l l f rom 11 5 days to 17 days. The “ E l Salvador 
EJciente” program led b y the Presidency O f f ice was probably one o f the c r i t ica l e lemen ts 
contributing to these resu l ts , as well as the passage o f new commerce-related legislation. 

The country’s traditionally sound macroeconomic management was maintained in recent 
years. Until E l Salvador was hit b y the global crisis in mid-2008, the country was o n track to 
achieve the CAS outcomes. The Government made significant progress in reducing the Non - 
Financial Public Sector (NFPS) deficit and in stabilizing NFPS debt ra t io as percentage of GPD, 
primarily through implementation o f the fiscal re fo rm package approved in 2004 that led to an 
increase in tax revenues o f 1 percent o f GDP between 2005 and 2007 (although tax collection 
declined in 2008 as a resu l t o f the crisis) and the elimination o f early retirement provisions to 
improve the sustainability o f the public pensions system. 

Moreover, recognizing the challenges associated with its unfavorable debt service profile, 
El Salvador took steps to improve its public debt management capacity. Progress was 
achieved in the development o f the cash-flow simulation model and scenario analysis and in 
design o f a preliminary debt management strategy. 

World Bank support under Pillar I : Progress towards achieving CAS outcomes under 
Pillar I was satisfactory. The Bank supported the Government’s impressive record in P i l la r I 
through a m i x o f analytical work, development po l i cy lending, ongoing investment lending (e.g., 
Public Sector Modernization Project) and grant-supported technical assistance. The DPL series 
underpinned by important analytical wo r k (CEM, PER, Regional ICA , FSAP) contributed 
substantially t o progress achieved under this Pillar. A l though funds fo r D P L I1 were never 
approved b y the Congress resulting in cancellation o f the loan, i t s triggers were completed. D P L 
I11 was halted p r io r to Board approval, however, i t s preparation contributed to po l icy dialogue 
with the authorities. As new lending came to a standstill, the Bank remained engaged through the 
preparation o f the ROSC on accounting and auditing and the implementation o f several grants 
(REDI, IDF and a WB I /BNPP grant). In addition, the Bank provided technical assistance based 
on the 2005 diagnostic “Needs Assessmen t o f Public Debt Management and Domestic Debt 
Ma rke t Development”, inc lud ing help in the establishment o f a debt management office. Due to 
i t s continued engagement w i t h the authorities, the Bank was able to respond quickly to reques ts 
fo r budget support as the e f fec ts o f the global financial crisis rocked E l Salvador. Lending 
resumed in January 2009, to support the Government’s goal o f maintaining macro stability 
through the implementation o f a two-tranche Public Finance and Social Sector Development 
DPL .

Pillar II: Improving: Eauitv through Building Human CaDital and ExuandinP Access to Basic 
Infrastructure Assets and Ma rke t 

The second pillar o f the Government’s plan a imed t o achieve un ive rsa l p r im a r y education and 
im p r o v e access t o secondary education, im p r o v e access t o basic hea l th services in targeted areas, 
and im p r o v e land tenure security and land transactions. The Gove rnmen t achieved a l l the 
outcomes l i n k e d t o hea l th service de l ive ry and p a r t i a l l y achieved the C A S outcomes f o r 
education. l7 

El Salvador has a strong history o f education reforms and i s expected to meet the 
Millennium Development Goals in the sector. The coun t r y has made good progress in 
expand ing access t o b o t h primary and l ow e r secondary education, and the C A S outcomes have 
been exceeded, with net primary en ro l lmen t rate and primary comp le t ion rate b o t h standing at 
97.7 percent in 2007.’’ At the secondary level, coverage i s s t i l l an issue as o n l y 58.6 percent o f 
ch i ld ren n o w attend secondary education (a 10 percent increase f r o m the 2003 ratio). The 
Gove rnmen t i s addressing t h i s p r o b l em th rough an innova t ive program, “EDUCAME ” , w h i c h 
a ims to p rov ide secondary educa t ion t o young people w h o have abandoned the f o rm a l education 
system and are part o f the labo r force. Further challenges w i l l need t o be addressed, however, 
with respect t o equity, qua l i ty and e f f ic iency b o t h in primary and secondary education. Progress 
in the education sector was ach ieved th rough the imp lemen ta t ion o f the Government’s landmark 
education strategy: “Plan 2021 ”. 
Progress was also achieved in terms of quality and access to health services. Recent 
i n f o rm a t i o n f i o m househo ld surveys indicates tha t the qua l i ty o f hea l th services p rov ided by the 
systems as a w h o l e has im p r o v e d ~ 1 i g h t l y . l ~ Similarly in terms o f C A S outcomes related t o 
expand ing coverage and q u a l i t y o f hea l th services t o the mos t vulnerable, coverage in p o o r 
targeted areas was extended t o 635,805 people, and access t o basic healthcare was im p r o v e d

this progress th rough the c rea t ion o f a H e a l t h Sector Fund t o im p r o v e hea l th coverage, funded by 
excise taxes o n cigarettes, beer, a lcoho l ic beverages, and guns and by ex tend ing coverage o f

This approach was successful in cove r ing the country’s poorest mun ic ipa l i t ies u s i n g the same 
targeting c r i te r ia as the cond i t iona l cash transfer p rog ram Red Solidaria. 

World Bank support under Pillar 11: Bank support to the Government’s CAS 
achievements under Pillar I 1 was moderately satisfactory; w h i l e highly relevant, the impac t 
o f support was m o r e l i m i t e d than envisioned. The Gove rnmen t highly va lued the techn ica l 
expertise b rough t i n t o the p repa ra t ion o f the new operations (Secondary Educa t ion and Land 
Adm in is t ra t ion 11) and secured alternate f inanc ing t o imp lemen t t h em when IBRD lend ing

assistance and non-lending activities. The Bank also continued supervising the Earthquake 
Emergency Recovery and Health Services Extension project wh ich contributed to expanding 
health access to a ha l f -a -m i l l ion people primarily through support to a target community-based 
approach and by advancing on the reconstruction or rehabilitation o f several key hospitals. The 
Bank also produced a study o n H I V / A ID S and a regional study o f Health Strategies and 
Reforms. 

Pillar III: Enhancinp Security and Reducinp Vulnerability 

Under P i l la r 111, the Government aimed to improve governance, reduce vulnerability, provide 
better environmental protection, and reduce crime and violence. Remarkable progress was 
achieved in the design and implementation o f social protection programs. Progress was also 
observed in the other six areas supported by the CAS, albeit more modest. Outcomes were 
pa r t ia l ly achieved in four o f these six areas and there was some progress toward the outcomes in 
areas o f developing environmental assessment capacity and regional catastrophic insurance 
program. 

El Salvador has continued to improve its overall governance framework fo r the public 
sector by further developing and improving its public financial management and control 
tools. In t e r m s o f CAS outcomes, the Integrated Financial Management System (SAFI) 
continued to be expanded and according to a recen t Public Expenditure and Financial 
Accountability (PEFA) assessment, 95 percent o f central government expenditures are being 
recorded, accounted and controlled according to international Performance Measurement 
Framework (PFM) standards, just short o f the CAS goal o f reaching a l l pub l ic sector en t i t ies . 

Progress was also achieved on the public procurement front, where the Government 
implemented the state-of-the-art pub l ic procurement dissemination too l COMPRASAL . This t o o l 
has allowed enhanced transparency and c red ib i l i ty o f pub l ic sector performance w i t h respec t t o 
an area perceived as vulnerable to mismanagement and corruption. 

The Government’s main vehicle in order to expand opportunities to vulnerable groups has 
been the expansion o f the Red Solidaria program. Red Solidaria was launched in 2005 as a 
conditional cash trans fer program targeted to households with children l i v i n g in the country’s 
poorest municipalities and n ow covers about 85,000 households. An independent evaluation 
found that the program i s among the best in the region, along with programs in B raz i l and Chile. 
In t e rm s o f CAS outcomes, approximately 500,000 people were pulled out o f poverty, p r ima r i ly 
in ru ra l areas. The expansion o f Red Solidaria in ru ra l areas has been accompanied by significant 
increases in the ava i lab i l i ty o f pub l ic health and education serv ices , thereby facilitating access to 
and, u t i l iza t ion of, these se rv ices . The challenge fo r E l Salvador mo v ing forward w i l l be t o 
maintain the gains achieved in recent years, to expand the Red Solidaria program in ru ra l areas, 
and t o design specific interventions targeted to the urban poor. 

Environmental protection remains a challenge in El Salvador. The country su f fe rs f r om 
significant environmental degradation which has led to poor water resource management as well 
as loss o f biodiversity and natural resources. Developing a national environmental po l i cy and 
strategy and consolidating the regulatory and legal framework fo r environmental management 

Page I 4 0 

E l Salvador Coun t ry Pa r tne rsh ip Strategy FY05-FY09- Comp le t ion Repo r t 

were h i g h priorities for the Government at the onset o f the CAS. Some progress was made 
towa rd the CAS outcome o f a tes ted strategy fo r protected area consolidation; 3,100 hectares o f 
protected areas were legalized, inc lud ing a l l remaining subtropical dry forest remnan ts in the 
region. 

On the disaster risk management front, the Government has made significant progress in 
improving its ability to manage disasters through some key measures, inc lud ing (i) appointing 
one single entity, the Ministry fo r Environment and Natural Resources (MARN) to oversee the 
national po l icy fo r risk prevention and reduction; (ii) inc lud ing environmental r i s k s and disasters 
in the Na t iona l Environmental L a w regulation, and (iii) imp rov ing prevention and management 
o f environmental risk and degradation through the formulation o f a land development plan (Plan 
Nacional de Ordenamiento y Desarrollo Territorial). S t i l l , the country’s exposure to natural 
disasters remains a significant threat to economic and social development. The creation o f a 
regional catastrophic insurance program, the specific outcome supported b y the CAS, was not 
achieved. As questions began to emerge about the feasibility o f a catastrophe insurance program 
fo r Central America, the scheme evolved in to a flagship program to create the Central Am e r i c a n 
Probabilistic Risk Assessment t o o l (CAPRA). Developed in partnership with other multi-lateral 
agencies, CAPRA i s an innovative Bank knowledge product that uses open-source in fo rma t ion 
to create a comprehensive approach to risk management. CAPRA i s a multi-hazard disaster risk 
analysis and communication t o o l wh i ch supports the decision-making process in risk reduction, 
pub l ic and private investments, emergency management, and financial risk t rans fe r strategies. I t 
i s extremely relevant fo r E l Salvador and cou ld serve as the basis fo r developing a national 
catastrophe risk insurance program. 

Crime and violence continue to pose serious risks to El Salvador’s economic and social 
development, as they do in most Central American countries. Heavy-handed anti-gang 
policies were put in to law in 2003 and 2005 (“mano dura”). Their limited longer-term impact 
made way fo r a broader se t o f po l icy interventions beginning in 2007, inc lud ing imp rov ing 
collection o f data on crimes, convictions and incarcerations to i n f o rm policy-making, efforts to 
professionalize the courts and the police and activities to address underlying socioeconomic 
factors. The potential impact o f these measures has been overtaken by the economic and social 
effects o f the global financial crisis. So while a consensus had been reached on priorities fo r 
tack l ing crime and violence problems, this is sue w i l l have to be taken up again in the new 
context. Crime and violence w i l l likely continue to be a key challenge, no t just fo r E l Salvador 
but fo r the Central American region as a whole, and more s p e c i f i c activities could be considered 
in a new CAS. The regional Crime and Violence Po l icy Options Study which i s under 
preparation by the Bank i s designed to i n f o rm national dialogues on crime and violence. 

World Bank support under Pillar 111: Bank support to the Government’s CAS 
achievements under Pillar I11 was moderately satisfactory. As was the case fo r P i l la r 11, Bank 
support was h igh ly relevant, but i t s impact was more limited than expected. M o s t notably, the 
Bank was a key partner in the design and implementation o f the Social Protection (Red 
Solidaria) program, p rov id ing support fo r institutional design and sustainability, sharing 
international bes t practice on similar conditional cash transfer efforts in other countries and 
supporting the development o f an ongoing impact evaluation e f fo r t to a l low fo r recalibration o f 
the program as needed. The Bank contributed t o progress in the area o f governance p r ima r i ly 
Page 1 41 

E l Salvador Coun t ry Pa r tne rsh ip Strategy FY05-FY09- Comp le t ion Repo r t 

through D P L I and D P L 11, and through the Public Sector Re fo rm and Judicial Modernization 
projects. Some progress was made through the implementation o f the Protected Areas 
Consolidation and Administration Project (PACAP), a GEF grant aimed at Strengthening El 
Salvador’s Natural Protected Areas System, p r io r i t iz ing conservation efforts, and addressing land 
tenure and sustainable development within p i l o t protected areas to p rese rve globally important 
biodiversity. 

The relationship with the Government was also maintained through various analytical works 
(CPAR, CEA, etc.). Lend ing resumed in early 2009 in the fo rm o f a new D P L which, in addition 
to addressing fiscal issues , supports the Government’s efforts t o expand opportunities fo r 
vulnerable groups and expand coverage o f targeted social protection. 

Partners and Other Donors 

IFC 

I FC has focused attention o n Central America more closely by opening loca l off ices and 
assigning investment staff to the region in the last year. This has led t o the development o f a 
substantial pipeline o f new transactions in the food processing, retail, financial institutions, real 
estate development, manufacturing, and renewable energy sectors with country and regional 
perspectives. Financial markets and infrastructure investments w i l l be o f strategic importance 
going forward. I FC has also opened an Advisory Services o f f ice in S a n Salvador. W h i l e on ly 
two projects were committed du r ing this CAS period, E l Salvador has benefitted f rom regional 
projects, particularly in the financial and transport sectors geared towards strengthening regional 
integration. IFC po r t fo l io detail i s available in Annex 6. 

other PartnersDonom 
As mentioned above, to implement programs originally supported by cancelled Bank loans 
(2006-2007), the Government mobilized alternative funding sources including grants from 
bilateral donors. Indeed the Red Solidaria program was financed in part with grants f rom the 
European U n i o n and Luxembourg. Similarly, a significant i n f l ow f r om the United States 
Millennium Challenge Corporation supported other investment projects. C A B E I also provided 
funding to contribute to the implementation o f W o r l d Bank operations that were cancelled. M o r e 
recently, the IMF, IDB and the W o r l d Bank put together (paragraph 10) a complementary 
financial package t o support the country’s economic strategy t o cope with the adverse effects o f 
the global financial crisis. Fo r example, the IMF intervention sought to p rov ide a contingent l i n e 
o f l iqu id i ty to the Central Bank. S im i la r ly the IDB operation under the Liquidity Program for 
Growth Sustainability w indow sought to provide liquidity to the private sector by facilitating 
productive sector access to financial resources. Finally, the Bank’s D P L and the parallel IDB’s 
budget support operation were designed to provide liquidity to the Ministry o f Finance. Effective 
collaboration among multilateral institutions in delivering this package was welcomed and 
acknowledged by Government authorities. 

Important exogenous factors affecting the CAS outcomes 

Political developments weakened the Government’s ability to advance its policy agenda in 
the National Assembly as bo th the 2004 and the 2006 mid-term elections intensified the 
Page I 4 2 

E l Salvador Coun t ry Pa r tne rsh ip Strategy FY05-FY09- Comp le t ion Repo r t 

d iv is ion o f power in the Assembly and provided the ma in opposition party with veto powers over 
certain decisions such as foreign loans. The opposition blocked new foreign bo r row ing between 
September 2006 and June 2007, forcing the Government to use alternative financing vehicles 
such as t r u s t funds (F ide icom isos) . O n the economic front, the global economic turmoil and 
the slowdown o f the U.S. economy have affected El Salvador’s expected growth rates (2008 
and 2009) and negatively impacted poverty outcomes. 

Borrower Performance 

The Government’s development plan, “Safe Country 2004-2009” was ambitious and during 
the almost five years o f implementation o f its plan, the Administration worked to establish 
the conditions to accelerate economic growth and decrease poverty levels. Ow ing to i t s good 
performance and despite the difficult po l i t ica l context, the Government achieved progress 
towards the country development goals, wh ich the CAS supported, under a l l th ree strategic 
pillars o f i t s development plan, exceeding targets in some cases. 

, 

The Government’s strong ownership o f the design and outcomes o f the plan “Safe Country 
2004-2009’’ lead to the achievement o f several key indicators established under the various 
CAS objectives, effectively demonstrating the positive performance o f the Borrower as we l l 
as its commitment to achieving its medium-term development goals. M o r e specifically, the 
Borrower completed actions and policies o r ig ina l ly agreed upon in the development plan 
supported by the CAS, such as the implementation o f the fiscal re fo rm package approved in 
2004, the e l im ina t ion o f early retirement provisions to improve sustainability o f the pub l ic 
pensions, and the implementation o f the action plan to improve tax administration. 

The Government’s failure to obtain congressional approval o f loans from multilateral 
agencies had a serious negative impact on the implementation o f the lending program. To 
i t s credit, however, the Government was able to secure alternate sources o f financing to 
implement projects, and, together with Wo r ld Bank management decided to maintain a po l ic y 
dialogue through other instruments, such as technical assistance, analytical wo rk and grants. 

Bank Performance (Moderately Satisfactory) 

Design of the Country Assistance Strategy and Progress Report 

The CAS and CAS Progress Report design was appropriate and relevant. The Strategy- 
closely aligned with the Government’s “Safe Country 2004-2009” development plan and i t s 
th ree pillars-was amply discussed with the Government and other stakeholders who engaged 
early in the process. These early discussions improved the CAS design and se t the basis fo r good 
implementation. A c r i t ica l decision was the inc lus ion o f the D P L series, wh ich addressed 
emerging challenges, particularly with regards t o macro stability and fiscal consolidation. The 
Progress Report l a i d out the changes in strategic direction and revisions to the Results Ma t r ix . 

I n light o f the evolving Salvadoran political context, the CAS specific outcomes were 
adjusted to respond to developments on the ground and the inability to lend in the new 
environment. The Bank emphasized continued support t o ongoing operations as well as 
proactive and innovative non-lending activities t o maintain the Bank’s engagement on key issues 

Page I 4 3 

E l Salvador Coun t ry Pa r tne rsh ip Strategy FY05-FY09- Comp le t ion Repo r t 

on the Government’s development agenda and provide a foundation fo r possible f u t u r e lending 
should opportunities open up. Such opportunity did open up in the second h a l f o f 2008, when 
the Government requested new lending in the f o rm o f Development Po l icy Lend ing to cope with 
the developing economic downturn. W h i l e this D P L had not been planned in the o r ig ina l CAS, 
i t s objectives were consistent with the th ree p i l la rs o f the Government’s development plan and 
the CAS. 

Risk Idenitjkation 

The CAS identified three sources o f r i s k s that could impact program implementation, 
namely: possible po l i t i ca l gridlock, the threat o f natural disaster, and a deteriorating external 
environment wh ich cou ld forestall needed growth. W h i l e the country did no t experience any 
devastating natural disaster during the CAS period, the other two potential risks did materialize. 
Po l i t ica l gridlock led to the cancellation o f f ive W o r l d Bank loans, and the ongoing global 
slowdown has impacted E l Salvador. A l though the risk o f po l i t ica l gridlock had been 
anticipated, the Bank did not f i l l y appreciate the extent o f the risk, and therefore did not include 
appropriate m i t iga t ion measures at the program and project leve ls . This i s the p r ima ry reason fo r 
the ‘‘Moderately Satisfactory” ra t ing o n W o r l d Bank performance. 

World Bank Engagement with the Government and beyond 

Given the cancellation o f several operations, Bank management opted to remain engaged in 
El Salvador through: (i) the continued implementation o f ongoing projects, which, in some 
cases meant allowing some operations to go beyond their normal life-span thus increasing 
the number o f overage projects in the portfolio, and (ii) the development o f non-lending 
activities. Engagement through proposed non-lending activities was welcomed no t on ly by the 
Government, but also by a my r iad other groups, who supported the presence o f the Bank in E l 
Salvador. For example, the Salvadoran Foundation for Economic and Social Development 
(FUSADES), an in f luen t ia l and well-regarded think-tank, expressed i t s in te res t in wo rk ing 
j o i n t l y with the Bank, especially o n analytical activities addressing transparency, crime and 
violence, poverty and quality o f pub l ic expenditures. The value added o f W o r l d Bank work, 
especially i t s innovative project designs and po l i cy advice in c r i t ica l areas such as economic 
g row th and fiscal management was h igh ly regarded by the Government. Last but no t least, the 
presence o f a loca l o f f ice in San Salvador has been a key factor in maintaining a dialogue with 
the authorities and engaging other stakeholders, inc lud ing the opposition party, opinion-makers, 
representatives o f multilateral organizations and c iv i l society on the ground. 

IBRD Lending 

During the CAS period, the Bank approved seven operations, including three DPLs f o r 
US%650 million and four investment operations f o r US%151 million. Tw o o f these seven 
operations (the D P L I and the Public Finance and Social Sector DPL ) were actually 
implemented, the latter s t i l l ongoing. Five operations were canceled b y the Bank as they failed 
to reach effectiveness within the expected timeframe, due to extreme polarization in the 
Salvadoran Congress. G iven this setback in the Bank’s program, two operations planned in the 
o r ig ina l CAS (the D P L I11 and the SME Participation in CAFTA ) were dropped, and the 
Modernization o f the State was postponed to the next CAS period. 

Page I 44 

E l Salvador Coun t ry Pa r tne rsh ip Strategy FY05-FY09- Comp le t ion Repo r t 

Development Policy Lending 

The approved DPLs have been an appropriate instrument to support El Salvador’s 
development strategy and priorities. Indeed a Quality Assurance Review (QAR) rated the f i r s t 
D P L as “highly satisfactory”, no t ing that the program responded to the Government’s po l ic y 
agenda, was timely and took in to account the po l i t ica l cycle, focused on key issues , and brought 
analytical depth h igh ly valued by the Government and other stakeholders. Quality-at-Entry, 
Quality o f Supervision and Overall Bank Performance were rated “highly satisfactory” in IEG’s 
Implementation Completion Report. Yet, the d i f f icu l ty faced b y the Executive in obtaining 
Congressional support fo r external loans impacted the D P L program. D P L I I , aimed at 
addressing fiscal issues and strengthening the international trade and business environment, was 
canceled and D P L I11 was dropped. Desp i te the cancellation o f D P L 11, the Government 
advanced the implementation o f a l l po l ic y actions agreed under that operation. As fo r the Public 
Finance and Social Sector DPL, i t has been c r i t ica l to maintaining a fluid dialogue w i t h the 
authorities at a time o f economic turmoil, while supporting continuity o f the institutional and 
social sector program and assisting with fiscal needs. 

DPLs prepared during the CAS pe r iod were closely aligned with Government policies and 
underpinned by a substantial body o f analytic wo rk carried out by the Bank in partnership with 
the Government o f E l Salvador. The programmatic D P L approach took in to account the lessons 
learned f rom past operations in E l Salvador and the latest th ink ing on budget support fo r well- 
performing countries such as E l Salvador. The D P L instrument was new and the Salvador D P L I 
was the very f i r s t D P L ever approved b y the W o r l d Bank Board. D P L 11, aimed at addressing 
fiscal issues and strengthening the international trade and business environment, was supported 
b y extensive wo rk done by the Bank and findings se t fo r th in the CEM , PER, DR -CAFTA 
studies, as well as the Investment Climate Assessment. Desp i te the cancellation o f the loan, the 
Government advanced the implementation o f a l l po l icy actions agreed under the f i r s t and second 
D P L operations.

2009, w h i c h con t r ibu ted t o the achievement o f C A S outcomes. 

Investment Lending 
The long effectiveness delays experienced with all operations approved under the CAS 
contributed to Unsatisfactory Implementation Progress (IP) ratings, and subsequent 
cancellation o f several operations. Performance ind ica to rs are ava i lab le in Annex 7. A l l 
inves tmen t operations imp lemen ted during the C A S p e r i o d we re designed and approved unde r 
the p rev ious CAS . Th ree operations su f fe red imp lemen ta t ion challenges (the Pub l ic Sector 
M o d e r n i z a t i o n (closed in 2007), and the ongo ing Jud ic ia l Mode rn iza t ion , and H o s p i t a l 
Recons t ruc t ion and H e a l t h Services). 
These challenges stemmed primarily f r o m o v e r l y 
amb i t ious objectives and comp lex designs. The B a n k in tens i f ied supe rv is ion as i s s u e s arose and 
in mos t cases imp lemen ta t ion recovered. 

The Jud ic ia l M o d e r n i z a t i o n p ro jec t i s expected t o reach p a r t i a l results. The H o s p i t a l 
Recons t ruc t ion and H e a l t h Services p ro jec t w i l l l i k e l y receive an ex tens ion and an assessment o f 
p ro jec t achievements w i l l be p r o v i d e d in the con tex t o f the Imp lemen ta t ion C om p l e t i o n Report. 
However, the s ign i f ican t imp lemen ta t ion delays t h i s ope ra t ion has su f fe red p o i n t t o some ea r ly 
f ind ings : (i) as this p ro jec t finances cons t ruc t ion o f several hospitals, m o r e in tens ive supe rv is ion 
and greater techn ica l expertise w o u l d have he lped imp lemen ta t ion ; (ii) furthermore, th is p ro je c t

hindered implementation. This type o f risk, inc lud ing m i t iga t ion measures, should be better 
reflected in future operations. 

Quality-at-Entry. IEG evaluated f i ve o f the seven operations delivered and rated Quality-at- 
Entry satisfactory in a l l cases (two “satisfactory”, two “moderately satisfactory” and one “highly 
satisfactory”). De ta i l i s available in Annex 7 . 

Quality o f Bank Supervision. Six lending operations were under implementation at the onset o f 
the CAS, o f wh ich two a re ongoing (the Hospital Reconstruction and Health Services and the 
Judicial Reform). The other four closed during the CAS period, together with the D P L I 
approved in FY07 . IEG rated the quality o f Bank Supervision satisfactory on a l l f ive operations. 
Furthermore, IEG rated Overall Bank Performance “Satisfactory” 
fo r four out o f the f i v e 
operations while a f i f t h one was rated “Moderately Satisfactory” rating. De ta i l i s available in 
Annex 7. 

AAA and Economic and Sector Work 

The non-lending program carried out during the CAS period was critical to maintaining 
the Bank’s engagement on key issues o f the Government’s development agenda. The AAA, 
wh ich was closely coordinated w i t h other donors (e.g., the PER was prepared j o i n t l y with the 
IDB), was also an important element behind the Bank’s rap id response t o the Authorities’ 
reques t fo r budget support in the second h a l f o f 2008. A concerted e f fo r t was made to enhance 
dissemination o f analytical work during the run-up t o the Ma rch 2009 elections, wh ich was key 
to in fo rm ing the current Administration p r io r to i t s taking o f f ice in June 2009 . The Bank, IDB 
and IMF held a two-day workshop fo r the incom ing President, members o f his transition team, 
and members o f Congress, to discuss the country’s short- and long-term development challenges 
and propose steps to address those challenges. Participants in the workshop appreciated the 
analyses and best-practice examples brought to the table to help the new Administration wo rk 
through the costs and benefits o f proposed p o l i c y responses. The po in t was also made that such 
independent analyses could be particularly helpful in bu i ld ing a consensus in Congress to 
approve loans f rom multilaterals, a stumbling b lock in the past. 

Economic and sector wo rk conducted during the CAS period has been re levan t and o f good 
quality. Findings in a l l analytical wo rk were used to i n f o rm current or planned Government 
programs. Though at the time o f the CAS Progress Report new investment lending was no t 
under preparation, the Bank continued to provide technical support to project implementation 
and po l icy dialogue in key sectors. In some cases (e.g., social protection, education) the Bank 
supported programs financed w i t h Government financing through non-lending TA. 

Justification of Rating for Overall Bank PerfoPmance 

Bank performance i s rated as Moderately Satisfactory based on the fo l low ing : 

W h i l e Bank management was proactive and engaged despite the d i f f i c u l t po l i t ica l 
context in E l Salvador to try and build consensus in Congress, the Bank cou ld have 
better estimated the extent o f the risk o f po l i t ica l polarization to the CAS program. 

Page I 4 7 

E l Salvador C o u n t r y Pa r tne rsh ip Strategy FY05-FY09- Comp le t ion Repo r t 

On the positive side: CAS (and Progress Report) design was appropriate and relevant 
and Bank management remained f lex ib le to adapt the outcomes as the ‘country po l i t ica l 
context evolved. 

The Bank was able t o maintain a dialogue with the Bo r rowe r in sp i te o f limited 
lending options, to provide a foundation fo r possible future lending; 
The Bank provided extensive and timely support to the Government, bo th f rom Task 
Managers and Management based in Washington, but especially through the 
decentralized o f f ice in San Salvador; 
Project preparation was solid, based on quality sector work, in close collaboration 
with the Borrower. IEG rated Quality-at-Entry satisfactory o n a l l f ive operations i t 
evaluated, that were approved under the CAS; 
Quality-of-Bank Supervision was rated by IEG satisfactory o n a l l f ive operations i t 
evaluated that closed under the CAS. 

Sustainability o f the CAS outcomes 

The sustainability o f the CAS outcomes cannot be guaranteed given the variety o f risks 
identified in the CAS and DPLs. These include: 

Fiscal risks. E l Salvador NFPS debt burden o f 39.2 percent o f GDP at end 2008 i s 
expected to boost to above 45 percent o f GDP in 2009 and cou ld reach 50 percent in 
2010, increasing the country’s vulnerability to potential shocks as the fiscal space w i l l 
s h r i n k accordingly. 
Political risks. Desp i te the strong electoral mandate o f President Funes , a d iv ided 
. External risks. The global recession could continue affecting negatively E l 
Assembly cou ld become an obstacle to certain reforms and the impasse experienced 
during the CAS pe r iod in the approval o f foreign loans cou ld reoccur. 
. Implementation risks. The arrival o f the FMLN to power fo r the f i r s t time s ince the 
Salvador’s economy and delay the recovery. 
end o f the c i v i l war could r e s u l t in significant changes in l i n e ministries, which, in 
turn, could affect implementation capacity. 
Natural disaster risks. The country has proven vulnerable to ea r thquakes and 
hurricanes, wh i ch could hurt the performance o f the economy and negatively affect 
CAS outcomes. 

. 

Lessons and Recommendations 

Two types o f lessons may be drawn from this CAS program design and implementation: 
strategic lessons (some a re sector-specific) and operational lessons. Mos t o f these lessons 
emerged f rom Implementation Completion Reports and Cancellation Notes, and f rom discussion 
with task managers and s ta f f whose assessments are the resu l t o f direct experience or knowledge 
o f our wo rk in E l Salvador. 

Page I 4 8 

E l Salvador Coun t ry Pa r tne rsh ip Strategy FY05-FY09- Comp le t ion Repo r t 

Strategic lessons 
The polarized po l i t i ca l environment in E l Salvador requ i res the Bank to iden t i fy areas o f 
consensus across the board t o define the appropriate m i x o f lending and non-lending assistance. 

G iven the Salvadoran context, the Bank’s consultation process needs to be extended beyond the 
executive branch to engage with the legislative branch and other stakeholders. B y the s am e 
token, proactive loca l outreach e f fo r t and a strong communication strategy are critical. 
Experience suggests that successful programs require continuous consultation to secure broad 
support. 

When considering Development Po l icy Lending in a h igh ly po l i t ic ized context like E l Salvador, 
the Bank cou ld proceed with multiple-tranche operations (as in the case o f the Public Finance 
and Social Sector DPL ) t o m in im ize the number o f Congressional approvals needed in the 
context o f a D P L series, although c lea r ly this line o f action wou ld re su l t in lower f lex ib i l i ty to 
adjust the program. Similarly the re may be value in (i) submitting several loans as a package fo r 
congressional approval, and (ii) focusing project preparation on few larger operations as opposed 
to many small operations. 

In cases where the Borrower decides to u s e grant funds to finance projects prepared with Bank 
assistance, Bank management needs t o decide whether to remain engaged in project 
implementation by o f fe r ing non-lending technical assistance. 
In E l Salvador, non-lending 
technical assistance proved to be a viable alternative to lending. 

Ana ly t ica l wo rk i s an extremely important too l to iden t i fy gaps in specific sectors, i n f o rm 
stakeholders, build consensus around important development is sue s and prepare the groundwork 
fo r fu tu re engagement in areas o f mutual in te res t . Experience in E l Salvador has shown that the 
Government greatly values the range o f global expertise the Bank can b r ing to complex 
development issues . 

In addition, experience in implementing this CAS program has shown that the Bank can have a 
positive impact even in the absence o f a significant lending program. In t e r m s o f resu l ts , many 
CAS outcomes were achieved through technical assistance and analytical work. 

Recommendations 

Greater flexibility in the new CAS. The country faces a number o f challenges associated w i t h 
the global crisis inc lud ing significant uncertainty as to the t im ing o f the recovery. F le x ib i l i t y to 
react to potential emerging but s t i l l unknown challenges appears to be c r i t ica l in this context. 

Need for effective dialogue and consensus-building, Although, recent agreements between the 
Government and opposition pa r t ies regarding the country’s financing needs suggest that the re 
may be some space fo r collaboration and consensus on key issues , the new Administration w i l l 
face serious po l i t i ca l and economic challenges in ensuring support fo r i t s future economic 
policies. The need fo r more effective dialogue and consensus-building i s an urgent challenge, 
wh ich donors, inc lud ing the W o r l d Bank, could help address by p rov id ing necessary technical 
input to the economic debate. 

Page I 4 9 

E l Salvador Coun t ry Pa r tne rsh ip Strategy FY05-FY09- Comp le t ion Repo r t 

Sec to r -spec i f ic : D i s a s t e r Risk M a n a g e m e n t . Given the fiscal challenges L a t i n American 
countries are facing as a result o f the global financial c r i s is , the possibility o f Development 
Po l icy Lend ing with a Catastrophe De fe r red D rawdown Option (CAT DDO ) could be a cost- 
efficient op t ion fo r E l Salvador to strengthen i t s risk financing framework. Contingent loans such 
as the C A T D D O provide a source o f immediately available l iqu id i ty during a state o f 
emergency caused by a natural disaster, while a l low ing the country to pursue i t s development 
programs during a catastrophe. 

Sec to r -spec i f ic : P r o c u r e m e n t R e f o r m . Procurement re fo rm i s complex and often unsuccessful 
u n l e s s the appropriate tools a re applied. Reforms can f a l l in to the trap o f starting by tackling 
structural change (Le., legal reform) rather than addressing non-structural changes. The new 
CAS cou ld benefit f r om the lessons l e a r n t in Panama and Peru, two countries where procurement 
re fo rm has advanced significantly supported by just-in-time technical assistance f r om the Bank. 
B y leveraging the banks international reach and knowledge base the po l i cy dialogue was backed 
up with high-level advice o n h ow to modernize and re fo rm the various components o f the pub l ic 
procurement system. The CAS could h igh l igh t the importance o f a well-functioning pub l ic 
procurement system in a modem state. The Bank’s ro le in p rov id ing technical advice w i l l be 
c r i t ica l in this process. 

Sec to r -spec i f ic : Land A d m i n i s t r a t i o n . A pragmatic and incremental approach to legal reforms 
i s often the bes t approach. The Land Administration I project envisaged support fo r key reforms, 
some o f wh ich turned out to be too ambitious, such as legislative changes. I t became clear that, 
given the sensitivity o f land administration reform, f lex ib i l i ty and incremental learning and 
experimentation was more effective to consolidate gains and move forward. 

Operational lessons 

Future operations in E l Salvador should be designed based o n an assessment o f the capacity 
available in the country, and w i t h due consideration o f the country’s po l i t ica l economy. 
Complexity in design, particularly multiplicity o f implementing agencies, should be reduced t o 
the extent possible, and where i t i s not, clear project implementation plans must be available 
before the project becomes effective. 

Du r ing the project preparation phase, the Bank’s team should elaborate an in fo rma t ion and 
communication strategy in order to engage w i t h the country’s legislative branch o f and other 
stakeholders, inc lud ing loca l communities where appropriate. 

Project management in complex po l i t ica l environments requ i res Bank Task Team Leaders 
(TTLs) with a specific s k i l l s se t encompassing negotiation, con f l ic t resolution, and alliance 
bu i ld ing abilities. 

Bu i ld ing an adequate system o f Mon i to r ing and Evaluation (including baseline data collection) i s 
no t on ly essential to assess progress but also to make effective mid-course corrections du r ing 
implementation as and when needed. M&E needs to be in place in advance o f implementation 
and needs to include a focus on project impacts.

El Salvador CAS - I F C Portfolio 

As o f M a y 2009, IFC had f ive active clients in E l Salvador and an outstanding 
balance o f $86.24 m i l l ion . In Calendar Year 2008, I FC clients employed 5,880 workers 
compared with 1,166 in C Y 2005. Payments t o the government by I FC clients rose to 
$8.5 m i l l i o n in C Y 2008, an increase o f 90% in the same time period. The number o f 
SME loans saw an increase o f 80% to 24,000. The number o f microfinance loans posted 
a r i s e o f 51%. E igh ty percen t o f transactions had h i g h development outcomes in FY 
2009. Financial institutions accounted for $64 m i l l ion , o r 57% o f the committed balance, 
as o f June 30 2009. The balance o f the investments i s in air transportation, commercial 
real estate, and a US$49,000 equity s take in a hand tools manufacturing company. 
I FC has th ree clients in the financial services industry. Fundaci6n Ca lp i i i i s a non- 
p r o f i t organization that supports micro and small en te rp r ises in a l l sectors o f the 
economy. I FC l e n t Calpia $10 m i l l i o n in 2004. Average loan sizes are $1,000 equivalent. 
Up to 20,000 individuals benefit directly or indirectly f r om access to credit provided by 
I FC through i t s fac i l i ty to Calpia. In 2004, I FC len t Banco Ag r ico la $50 m i l l i o n to 
promote primary mortgage lending and strengthen i t s balance sheet by p rov id ing scarce 
long-term funding. This has enhanced i t s ab i l i ty to offer medium- and long-term funding 
to companies in key sectors, complementing the government’s e f fo r t to help SMEs and 
export-oriented corporates benefit f rom regional trade liberalization. A $3 0 m i l l i o n loan 
in 2005 to Banco U n o to finance i t s regional expansion was prepaid when the bank was 
sold t o a foreign investor. 
I FC has supported mortgage lender L a Hipotecaria in i t s p r ima ry bus iness o f 
p rov id ing long t e r m mortgages fo r the l o w and middle income segment o f the residential 
mortgage market in Panama and E l Salvador. By p rov id ing long t e r m mortgages, the 
c l i e n t can make house purchases more affordable, particularly fo r lower income 
consumers. 
In the infrastructure sector, IFC committed $30 m i l l i o n in 2005 to TACA , a 
Salvadorian airline to expand i t s network, and so provide safe air travel service to and 
f i o m Central America. This i s needed to facilitate regional economic growth. 
In the commercial real estate sector, I FC supported Metrocentro with a $25 
m i l l i o n loan in 2004 to anchor urban development in a strategic development zone, 
develop a modern re ta i l ing industry, and creating small business opportunities and jobs. 
E l Salvador has a history o f sound economic policymaking. I t has well-managed 
banks and corporations wh ich have already taken strategic positions in neighboring 
countries. However, the local and regional economies are heav i ly exposed to the U S 
e i the r through exports or worker remittance flows. I FC i s preparing to support i t s current 
c l i e n t s and seek new opportunities to help viable companies survive the c r i s i s and 
maintain employment.

Annex 3. Public Consultations on the CPS 

The Bank h e l d a series o f meetings t o ob ta in feedback o n the Bank ’s p roposed p rog ram in El 
Salvador during the third week in August, 2009. A t o t a l o f about 50 pa r t ic ipan ts f r o m NGOs , 
think tanks, universities, the media, p r iva te sector representatives and members o f Congress 
pa r t ic ipa ted in the consultations in San Salvador. 

A Powe rPo in t presentation was prepared and de l ive red t o describe the Bank’s p rog ram w h i c h 
inc ludes operations in response t o the Government’s Anti C r is is Plan as w e l l as the coun t ry ’s 
longe r - te rm development challenges. Participants were suppo r t ive o f the focus o f the Bank 
p rog ram and the Bank ’s r o l e in support o f the country. At the same t ime , pa r t ic ipan ts raised 
some issues and p r io r i t ies f o r the Bank t o consider. B e l o w i s a summa ry o f the v iews expressed 
by d i f fe ren t stakeholders during the mee t ing . 

The current economic c r is is . The various pa r t ic ipan ts b road ly agreed with the development 
challenges as described in the presentation, and supported the Bank ’s p rog ram in response t o the 
current coun t ry context. Several groups o f stakeholders raised concerns about the impac t o f the 
c r is is o n unemp loymen t and secu r i ty in pa r t icu la r . Some suggested the c r is is w o u l d be an 
oppo r tun i ty t o create m o r e e f f ic ien t p u b l i c po l ic ies f o r the med ium - and long - te rm . 

Several pa r t ic ipan ts ra ised concerns rega rd ing the f isca l s i tua t ion and the imp l ica t ions f o r longe r - 
t e rm debt sustainability. Many suggested the need f o r f isca l r e f o rm and suggested the Bank ’s 
know ledge in this area c o u l d he lp . I t w i l l be impo r tan t that the coun t r y m o v e towa rds a mo re 
sustainable debt t ra jec to ry in the near future. 

Medium-term agenda. There we re several discussions regarding the med ium - te rm agenda, 
i n c l u d i n g h o w t o achieve h ighe r rates o f g r ow t h and the need f o r econom ic development t o 
accompany social development. Some pa r t ic ipan ts men t ioned the pos i t ive r o l e I F C c o u l d p l a y in 
the p r iva te sector. O the r pa r t ic ipan ts men t ioned tha t mo re c o u l d be done t o p romo te P u b l i c 
P r iva te Partnerships f o r example. 

Many pa r t ic ipan ts recogn ized there was scope t o im p r o v e p u b l i c finance management, i n c l u d i n g 
the qua l i ty o f p u b l i c spending and imp lemen ta t ion o f enhanced p rocu remen t practices. There 
was also b road support t o enhance transparency and p u b l i c access t o in fo rma t ion . 

A l l stakeholders were pa r t icu la r ly concerned about the increasing leve ls o f c r im e and v io lence in 
El Salvador. W h i l e the Bank has conducted some ana ly t ica l w o r k in t h i s area pa r t ic ipan ts 
suggested m o r e c o u l d be done as this i s an issue o f c r i t i c a l impo r tance t o the N a t i o n a l agenda. 
Several stakeholders also raised the fac t the Bank shou ld con t inue t o be ac t ive in G l o b a l P u b l i c 
Goods such as the env i ronmen t and c l ima te change. These issues represent serious challenges 
f o r E l Salvador and s h o u l d n o t be l o s t in the current focus o n the econom ic crisis. 

Instruments and Implementation. The re we re some questions ra ised rega rd ing the r o l e o f 
Deve lopmen t P o l i c y Loans (DPL) and the ac t iv i t ies w h i c h i t c o u l d finance. The Coun t ry 
Manage r exp la ined the d i f fe rence be tween inves tmen t and DPL lending, i n c l u d i n g that: 
“Development p o l i c y lending funds are disbursed against satisfactory imp lemen ta t ion o f the 

67 

development p o l i c y l e n d i n g program, i n c l u d i n g comp l iance with tranche release cond i t ions and 
maintenance o f a satisfactory macroeconomic p o l i c y f iamewo rk . T h e bo r rowe r comm i ts n o t t o 
use development p o l i c y lending funds f o r i n e l i g i b l e expenditures. The Bank n o rm a l l y disburses 
the l o a n proceeds i n t o an account that fo rms part o f the coun t ry ’s o f f i c i a l fo re ign exchange 
reserves (no rma l ly held by the central bank), and an amoun t equ iva len t t o the l o a n proceeds i s 
credited t o an account o f the government t o finance budgeted expenditures.” T h i s was impo r tan t 
t o c l a r i f y as some pa r t ic ipan ts be l ieved f i n d s w o u l d be disbursed d i rec t ly t o Sector Ministries o r 
t o finance expenditures w h i c h were n o t agreed within the budget. 

There we re some concerns raised rega rd ing the cu r ren t Government’s imp lemen ta t ion capacity, 
and the fac t tha t there we re s ign i f ican t delays in imp lemen t ing the cu r ren t Bank po r t fo l io . There 
i s a need t o w o r k with the n e w government t o fu r the r build capacity, and the Bank i s w e l l p laced 
t o p rov ide know ledge services, techn ica l assistance and capacity building. This i s impo r tan t f o r 
the short t e rm as we l l , as many o f the in te rven t ions i d e n t i f i e d in the Anti C r is is P lan represent 
new ac t iv i t ies w h i c h w i l l need t o be designed. 

CPS Bank Program. Many pa r t ic ipan ts agreed with the f l e x i b l e nature o f the CPS, pa r t icu la r ly 
in light o f the current env i ronmen t and given that a longe r t e rm N a t i o n a l v i s i o n w i l l need t o be 
developed. 

There we re n o spec i f ic i s s u e s raised with the ind ica t ive p ro jec ts men t ioned f o r the outer years o f 
the CPS. In fact, several pa r t ic ipan ts supported a possible Urban T ranspo r t Project, and several 
stakeholders men t ioned the impo r tance o f science and techno logy and in pa r t icu la r the idea o f a 
N a t i o n a l system t o p romo te innova t ion . 

Some stakeholders did suggest the p o s s i b i l i t y o f w o r k i n g with l o c a l governments d i rec t ly . This 
w o u l d also h e l p commun i t ies t o see tang ib le results o f the Bank ’s f inanc ing in E l Salvador. 

R i s k s . F i n a l l y pa r t ic ipan ts agreed with the risk re la ted t o the p o l a r i z e d p o l i t i c a l env i ronmen t and 
suggested m o r e c o u l d be done t o expand consultations during CPS imp lemen ta t ion and p romo te

In response the Bank w i l l w o r k t o con t inue t o consu l t with va r ious stakeholders regu la r ly ,

Annex 4. Debt Sustainability Analysis 

1. 

The ou t look o n E l Salvador’s med ium - te rm mac roeconom ic prospects has deteriorated 
since the las t D S A was prepared in the con tex t o f the P u b l i c Finance and Soc ia l Sector 
Deve lopmen t P o l i c y Loan . As a resu l t debt dynam ics have also changed. The rev ised debt 
sus ta inab i l i ty analysis in this P rog ram Documen t i s based o n the macroeconomic f ramewo rk 
deve loped by IMF s t a f f f o r the Standby P rog ram and Bank s t a f f projections. 

2. 

T h e debt sus ta inab i l i ty analysis (Table A . l ) indicates tha t the p u b l i c debt t o GD P r a t i o i s 
expected t o con t inue o n an increasing p a t h until 201 1, w h e n i t w i l l reach 50.1 percent o f GD P 
be fo re starting t o dec l ine t o reach 46.2 percent in 2014. This t ra jec to ry w o u l d be consistent with 
a primary f isca l balance d e f i c i t averaging 1.5 percent o f GD P ove r 2009-201 1, and a primary 
balance surplus averaging .7 percent o f GD P over 2012-2014. The f isca l imp ro vemen t after 201 1 
w o u l d b e d r i v e n by b o t h an expected better econom ic env i ronmen t and the f isca l in te rven t ions o f 
the Gove rnmen t (tax r e f o rm and ra t iona l iza t ion o f subsidies). As f o r the t ra jec to ry o f the to ta l 
ex te rna l debt, the rev ised macroeconomic f ramewo r k assumes an average n o n interest current 
account balance surplus o f 0.4 percent o f GDP ove r 2009-2014 and i s consistent with stable debt 
dynam ics until 2011 (at about 44 percent o f GDP) be fo re dec l in ing t o 40.5 percent o f GDP in 

2014.

There are, however, a numbe r o f risks t o the med ium - te rm ou t loo k associated with the
