COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY PROGRESS REPORT 

1. 

This Country Assistance Strategy Progress Report (CASPR) provides a mid- 
term assessment of the implementation of the World Bank’s FY07-10 Malawi Country 

Assistance Strategy. The Boa rd o f the Executive Directors discussed the FY 0 7 -FY 10 
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) fo r M a l aw i on February 13, 2007. The CAS 
represents the W o r l d Bank’s strategic alignment w i t h the M a l a w i G row th and 
Development Strategy (2006-1 1) and seeks to support the Government’s e f fo r t to achieve 
broad-based g row th and poverty reduction. Fo l low ing the IDA 15 replenishment, some 
US$260 m i l l i o n w i l l be available to M a l aw i over FY 0 9 and FY10 , a significant increase 
on the US$180m envisaged in the CAS. 

2. 

The primary focus of the CAS has been on growth promotion, enhanced social 
protection and the improvement of governance. Despite the changes in the external 

environment resulting f r om the global downturn, this report concludes that the current 
strategy remains appropriate. Therefore, n o modifications to the CAS results framework 
are recommended. In l i n e w i t h the ins t i tu t iona l requirements o f the CASPR, this report 
sets out to: (i) assess implementation progress during the first tw o years o f the CAS; (ii) 
rev is i t the strategy on the basis o f implementation experience and lessons learned; (iii) 
address opportunities fo r enhanced IDA programming in the context o f AFR regional 
desire fo r a more ambitious/transformative approach to IDA programs in the face o f the 
global crisis. 

3. 

A. BACKGROUND TO THE FY07-10 CAS 
Malawi is a small, densely populated, land-locked country, with one of 
the 
lowest levels of per capita income in the world (US$230 in 2006). In 2005, around 85 

percent o f the population l i v e d in r u r a l areas, where the ma jo r i ty was engaged in rain-fed 
subsistence agriculture. Mos t people are h i g h l y vulnerable to illness, shocks and annual 
ra in fa l l vo la t i l i ty , which, in conjunction w i t h poo r ly developed input and output markets, 
has resulted in chronic food insecurity and contributed to widespread malnutrition. The 
2006 Poverty and Vu lne rab i l i ty Assessment (PVA), based on data f r om the Integrated 
Household Survey ( M S ) o f 2005, revealed that M a l aw i made very l i t t l e progress in 
reducing poverty between 1998 and 2005, and that over h a l f the population (52% o r 6.4 
m i l l i o n people) was l i v i n g be low the poverty l i n e in 2005. 

The Government of President Bingu wa Mutharika came to of$ce 

4. 
and was re-elected in May 2009. The Government has made substantial progress in 
pursuing sustainable fiscal policies and ma in ta in ing macroeconomic stability. Economic 
g row th between 1995 and 2005 was l o w and volatile, averaging 2.7 percent, w i t h annual 
population g row th o f over 2 percent du r ing the same period. Recurrent weather shocks t o 
smallholder agricultural production and a lack o f investment were compounded by high 
in f la t ion , and h igh nom ina l and real interest rates, fueled b y poor pub l ic expenditure 
management. Since taking office, the Government has brought pub l ic spending under 

in May 2004 

1 

con t ro l and reduced the large pub l ic debt. B y 2006, macroeconomic performance had 
significantly imp roved (w i t h interest and in f la t ion rates h i g h but falling), and M a l aw i had 
completed the first and second reviews o f an IMF Poverty Reduction and G row th Fac i l i ty 
(PRGF) agreed in 2005. M a l aw i reached completion po in t o f the Heav i ly Indebted Poor 
Countries (HLPC) In i t ia t ive in August 2006. 

5. 
The Government has made fighting corruption a key plunk in its program, and 
has achieved results in tackling high-level graf. Perceived corruption in M a l aw i in 
2005 was relatively better than in most low-income countries in Africa.’ However, a k e y 
indicator measuring corruption in M a l aw i deteriorated over the past decade2. Stepping 
up the anti-corruption agenda, between 2004 and 2006 the An t i -Co r rup t ion Bureau 
(ACB ) launched several investigations o f high p ro f i le persons in government as w e l l as 
the opposition, leading to several arrests and convictions. 

6. 
The long-term vision of the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS ) 
is to transform Ma law i f rom a predominantly importing and consuming country into a 
predominately producing and exporting country. The MGDS recognizes that strong and 
sustainable economic g row th i s k e y to reducing poverty and seeks to achieve g row th 
rates o f a t least 6 percent a year. 
In the med ium term, the strategy concentrates o n 
agriculture as the driver o f growth, focusing on increasing agricultural p roduc t iv i ty and 
integrating smallholder farmers i n t o commercial activities. The document has a strong 
focus on results, wh ich has been supported by the W o r l d Bank. 

7 . 
The CAS 
identified three key challenges 
Government’s development goals: 

to the achievement of 

the 

Pervasive risk a t the national and household level resulting p r ima r i ly f r om 
food insecurity caused by weather-related shocks to agricultural production and 
poo r ly func t ion ing agricultural markets, macroeconomic instability, and illness or 
death, especially f r om HIV/AIDS. 

0 P r iva te sector development has been constrained by macroeconomic 
instability, deficient infrastructure, especially l im i t e d and unreliable electricity 
supply, a shortage o f sk i l led personnel, expensive and restricted access to credit, 
crime and corruption. 
Weak institutional capacity. M a l aw i faces severe human resource constraints in 
key sectors, inc lud ing health and education, due in part to the inab i l i ty o f the 
education system to produce sufficient graduates and exacerbated b y the impact 
o f the HIV/AIDS epidemic. 

0 

Malawi’s score on the Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index (TICPI) in 2005 was 2.8 out o f 10, 
compared to the average for other Low Income Countries in Africa (2.5), Mozambique and Madagascar (2.8), Zambia 
(2.6), Uganda (2.5), Niger (2.4), Cameroon (2 .2) and Ethiopia (2.2). 
M a l aw i ’ s T ICP I went d ow n f r om 4.1 in 1998 t o 2.8 in 2008, though the 2009 index shows improvemen t 

at 3.3. 

2 

8. 

The Results-Based CAS targets four key outcomes: 

i. 

ii . 

iii. 

i v . 

Imp rove smallholder agricultural productivity and integration in to agro- 
processing. (Related MGDS Goal: M e d i um term economic g row th through 
small-scale agriculture and agro-processing and food security) 

Put in place a foundation fo r long-term economic growth through improved 
infrastructure and the investment climate. (Related MGDS Goal: Enabling 
environment fo r private sector-led g row th and infrastructure) 

Decrease vulnerability a t the household level to H I V / A I D S and malnutrition. 
(Related MGDS Goal: HN /A IDS and Nu t r i t ion ) 

Sustain improvements in expenditure management, budget execution, and 
the accountability of the civil service. (Related MGDS Goal: Good 
Governance) 

The 
CAS is also aligned with the Bank’s regional strategic priorities. The focus 

9 . 
o f the CAS 
on growth, enhanced social protection and imp roved governance reflects the 
four p i l la rs 
o f the A f r i c a Ac t ion Plan (AAP): accelerating shared growth; building capable 

states; strengthening outcome-based na t iona l strategies and the Bank’s focus on results; and 
strengthening the g loba l development partnership f o r A f r ica . Consistent w i t h the lessons o f 

the 2007 review o f the AAP , the CAS i s fully aligned w i t h the Government’s M a l aw i 
G row th and Development Strategy, and the Bank i s co-financing f i v e out o f eleven 
projects in i t s program w i t h other development partners. Further, sector-wide approaches 
(SWAps) are in place o r under preparation in agriculture, education, infrastructure, water 
and sanitation, and pub l ic sector management. 

B. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE C A S (FY07-FYOS) 

(a) Recent Economic and Political Developments 

10. Malawi’s macroeconomic environment has continued to improve, although 
there are substantial risks to the macroeconomic program. Real GDP grew b y 6.7 

percent in 2006 and 8.6 percent in 2007, exceeding the 6 percent g row th target under the 
MGDS projected under the IMF-supported macroeconomic program. Economic g row th 
in 2008 i s estimated at 9.7 percent. This has pa r t ly been the result o f external factors, 
such as good ra in fa l l and strong international tobacco prices, but has also been 
underpinned by the Government’s continued commitment to prudent fiscal management 
and the implementation o f a fe r t i l ize r subsidy program. However, over-expenditure o n 
the fe r t i l ize r subsidy program in F Y 0 9 may put the IMF-supported macroeconomic 
program at risk. W h i l e there has been l i t t l e progress on export diversification over the 
l a s t tw o years, this w i l l change w i t h the opening o f a u ran ium m ine in 2009 wh ich i s 
expected to boost GDP b y 10 percent and exports b y 25 percent.

11. Malawi reached completion point for the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries 
(H I PC ) Initiative in August 2006 and qualified for the Multilateral Debt Relief 

Initiative. T h i s resulted in a decline in Ma law i ’s debt-to-exports ratio f r om 235.3 percent 
in 2005 t o 40.9 percent in 2006.3 The Government has also continued to reduce the leve l 
o f domestic pub l ic debt by enforcing strict f isca l discipline, wh i le using increased foreign 
f lows ( f r om debt re l ie f and budget support), and increased tax revenues, to reduce the 
domestic debt stock; domestic debt declined f r om 16.5 percent o f GDP in 2005 to 11.8 
percent at the end o f 2007. However, increased expenditure on the input subsidy program 
and on goods and services in recent times has l e d to an increase in domestic debt, wh ich 
shot up t o 19.0 percent o f GDP in 2008. The country’s dependence o n rain-fed 
agriculture and on a few agricultural commodities for exports continue to represent 
significant r i s k s to debt sustainability. Results o f the October 2009 j o i n t BanW IMF Deb t 
Sustainability Analysis are expected to shed more l i g h t on the country’s medium-term 
debt dynamics. 

Inflation has remained in single digits since 2007 . . In f la t ion f e l l in to single 

12. 
digits in January 2007 f o r the first t ime since 2003, but rose steadily between June and 
December 2008, as a result o f the lagged impact o f global o i l price rises and seasonal 
increases in food prices earlier in the year. However, in f la t ion has trended downward 
during 2009, reflecting moderation in food and fue l prices and restrained credit growth. 
As o f September 2009, headline in f la t ion was back down to 7.5 percent. F o l l ow i n g a 
significant reduction in government bo r row ing and lowe r in f la t ion rates, the central bank 
po l icy rate has fallen to 15 percent. Commercial bank lending rates have also fallen, and 
commercial bank lend ing to the private sector increased b y 35 percent between January 
and September 2008.4 

As a share o f GDP, the ex terna l debt stock decreased f r o m 108.3 percent in 2005 to 14.4 percent in 2006. 
This l i k e l y con tr ibu ted t o an increase in p r iva te inves tmen t f r o m 11.7 percent o f GDP in 2007, t o 18.2 
percent in 2008.

13. 

The nominal exchange rate has been pegged since 2006, which has contributed 
to Malawi’s worsening international reserve position. As a result, in 2008, the IMF 

reclassified the exchange rate regime as a de facto conventional peg. The f i x i n g o f the 
domestic currency to the dollar has appreciated the real exchange rate and eroded 
Ma law i ’s international reserve position. In spite o f foreign exchange savings f r om debt 
relief, increased in f lows f r om donors, and an exceptionally good season fo r tobacco in 
2008 
(Malawi’s ma in 
foreign exchange earner), 
international reserves remain 
precariously low , at 1.5 months o f expected imports at the end o f September 2009. The 
situation was exacerbated by increased global fe r t i l ize r and o i l prices in 2008, wh ich 
significantly worsened Ma law i ’s trade balance. As a result o f shortages in the foreign 
exchange market, recent reports suggest long delays faced b y the p r iva te sector in settling 
impo r t invoices, and spreads o f over 20 percent between the o f f i c i a l and parallel market 
exchange rates. 

14. 

A political stalemate between the President and the former ruling party 
hampered the Government’s ability to legislate until the recent election. President 

Mu tha r ika was elected as the r u l i n g United Democratic F ron t (UDF) candidate, but 
subsequently split f r om the UDF to form a new party, the Democratic Progressive Party 
(DPP). The Government did no t command a ma jo r i ty in Parliament and, wh i le i t was 
able to pass some legislation w i t h the support o f various opposition MPs, implementing 
the legislative agenda became increasingly a r d u ~ u s . ~ President Mu tha r ika was re-elected 
in M a y 2009 and the DPP won a ma jo r i ty o f seats, wh ich w i l l hope fu l ly a l low the 
smoother operation o f Parliament. 

After good initial progress, the anti-corruption agenda risks stalling. Progress 

15. 
against corruption faltered wh i le the post o f director o f the An t i -Co r rup t ion Bureau 
remained vacant; a new director was finally appointed in September 2007 after a delay o f 
almost a year. During this period, the Bureau was unable to s t a r t new cases, prosecute, or 
make c r i t ica l strategic directions, as these lega l ly require the director’s approval.6 This 
worsened an existing backlog o f cases created b y h igh turnover o f staff. 

(b) Progress towards CAS outcomes 

Progress towards achieving the goals of the FY07 -FY I0 CAS has been mixed. 

16. 
Good progress has been made towards tw o o f the four CAS Outcomes: outcome (iii) on 
HIV/AIDS and outcome ( iv ) on Public Expenditure Management. However, there has 
been m ixed progress o n outcome (i) in agricultural p roduc t iv i ty and market development 
and s im i la r ly on outcome (ii) w i t h some encouraging developments on transport 

The impact o f this parliamentary impasse was to delay the approval o f US$80m o f IDA projects. The 
Mozambique Interconnector (US$48m) and Agr icu l tura l Development Program Support Project (US$32m) 
are s t i l l waiting fo r legislative approval. 
Between 2006 and 2008, out o f the 1900 corruption complaints received, 700 were authorized fo r 
investigations, around 600 investigations were completed and 172 re ferred for prosecutions. 47 
prosecutions were concluded, w i th 22 convictions secured, 15 acquittals and 6 withdrawals. Tw o o f the 
prosecutions invo lved a sitting and a former cabinet m in is ter .

has a comparative advantage and w i thd raw ing f r om sectors where other donors are taking 
a lead. As a result, the Bank withdrew f r om the health sector after the closure o f the 
Health Sector Support Project in September 2008. However, the Bank remains engaged 
in H I V / A I D S and a successor to the Mu l t i -Sec to ra l AIDS Project i s under preparation.

c. FY09/FY10 AND BEYOND 

(a) Macroeconomic Outlook 

19. 
The global downturn caused by the dramatic escalation of the financial crisis in 
September 2008 has resulted in a significant adjustment in the global economy. The 
IMF W o r l d Economic Outlook (WEO) o f October 2009 projects that g loba l GDP w i l l 
contract by 1.1 percent during 2009, w i t h advanced economies contracting by 3.4 percent 
wh i le Sub-Saharan A f r ica i s expected to grow by a modest 1.3 percent. A l though modest 
global g row th i s projected to resume in 2010, the downturn has already resulted in a 
sharp decline in w o r l d trade, a contraction o f commercial lending, widespread 
realignment o f exchange rates and the systemic reduction o f OECD interest rates. 

20. 
Yet the global downturn has had a limited impact on Malawi so far, and growth 
is expected to stay strong. Firstly, this i s because Ma law i ’s financial institutions have 
been largely insulated f r om contagion, due to their l o w exposure to international credit 
instruments. However, f i v e o f Ma law i ’s n ine banks are fo re ign owned (constituting 32 
percent o f the market) and hence vulnerable to shocks experienced by parent banks. 
Secondly, the global prices o f Ma law i ’s ma in exports o f tobacco, tea and sugar have no t 
been subject to large adverse shocks. F ina l ly , significant additional output i s due to be 
generated f r om u ran ium exports expected to come o n stream during 2009. As a 
consequence, the IMF’s 2009 g row th forecast fo r M a l aw i i s 5.9 percent (o f f ic ia l forecasts 
project a g row th rate o f 7.6 percent in 2009)’ wh ich i s comparably higher than the global 
and regional outlook. 

21. 
The outlook for domestic inflation, interest rates and the exchange rate is 
uncertain, given recent external economic developments and future outlook. In the 
near term, in f la t ion i s projected to continue falling, f o l l ow i n g recent decreases in fue l 
prices, the stabilization o f food prices, and a better-than-average agricultural season in 
2009. However, in the med ium term, the ou t look i s uncertain, as i t i s dependent on 
developments in the w o r l d economy. Fo r example, wh i le fue l prices have come down 
significantly in recent months, the expected resumption o f global g row th in late 2009 i s 
l i k e l y to restore upward pressure o n prices. 
Interest rates in M a l aw i are p r ima r i ly 
determined b y government domestic bo r row ing requirements and the ove ra l l ins t i tu t iona l 
e f f ic iency o f the sector. W h i l e public-sector domestic bo r row ing has stabilized, 
government finances are extremely dependent o n a id flows, wh ich remain uncertain in 
the current global environment. The medium-term path o f the exchange rate i s s im i la r ly 
uncertain. In addition to the va r iab i l i ty o f g loba l economic developments, the exchange 
rate regime i tse l f may also change. The Government i s currently wo rk ing w i t h the IMF 
on the design o f a regime that ensures exchange rate stability, export competitiveness, 
and reasonable levels o f international reserves.

(b) CAS Strategy Implications (FY09-FY10) 

22. 

The objectives of the FY07-10 CAS remain relevant and aligned to the goals of 
the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy. The p r io r i ty areas ou t l ined in the CAS 

(agriculture, infrastructure, HIV/AIDS, nutrition, pub l ic sector management) remain the 
appropriate focus o f Bank resources. However, project scheduling and value have been 
adjusted in some cases to reflect changes in the implementation environment. Fo r 
example, po l i t ica l and administrative constraints have resulted in delayed implementation 
o f certain projects, and the availability o f additional regional financing has resulted in the 
inc lus ion o f projects consistent w i t h regional po l icy (e.g. Regional Communications 
Infrastructure Project). 

23. 

Ongoing analysis and the recent work of the Country Economic Memorandum 
( C EM ) confirm the underlying strategic approach. 

The C E M confirms 
that 
agricultural-led growth, particularly through exports, i s the most viable medium-term 
g row th strategy. I t also emphasizes the need to refocus government p o l i c y away f r om 
ad-hoc intervention towards p roduc t iv i ty enhancements and the need to increase pub l ic 
infrastructure investments in power and roads to promote agricultural growth. The CEM 
additionally recommends that the exchange rate regime be managed to op t im ize exports, 
and that M a l aw i should continue to press fo r the dismantling o f regional trade and transit 
barriers. The imp l ica t ion o f the C E M analysis i s therefore that, wh i le the CAS objectives 
w i l l be d i f f i c u l t to achieve, they remain the most appropriate goals fo r M a l aw i . 

24. 

The strategy of growth promotion, social protection and improving governance 
also remains appropriate in the face of the global downturn. Ma law i ’s iso la t ion f r om 

international commercial finance and the re la t ive ly strong performance o f tobacco 
relative t o other commodity prices have l im i t e d the impact o f the g loba l downturn to 
slower export g row th and a possible squeeze on export finance. However, a prolonged 
global recession, coupled w i t h fa l l ing tobacco prices and r is ing prices o f impo r ted inputs, 
wou ld create an income shock w i t h potentially serious welfare consequences. As a 
result, i t i s important that the CAS program i s sufficiently f lex ib le t o enable a rap id 
scaling up o f the social protection element. The program w i l l rev iew fund ing t o the 
M a l aw i Social Ac t ion Fund and ensure that i t i s able to channel increased project finance 
in the event o f shocks to smallholder income (as occurred during the drought o f 2005). 
As a medium term measure, the Bank has p rov ided financing to the Ag r icu l tu re sector to 
increase agriculture p roduc t iv i ty through the Ag r icu l tu ra l Development Program - 
Support Project (ADP-SP), and i s preparing a Food Secu r i tyRu ra l Development 
Program. The recruitment o f an international Human Development staff member in the 
M a l aw i o f f ice w i l l also enhance the Bank’s engagement in the fo rmu la t ion o f social 
protection po l icy . 

25. 
The main obstacles to implementation of the CAS during FY07 -08 have been 
(a) delays in project approvals and (b) ad-hoc government intervention in agricultural 

markets. Project scheduling has p r ima r i ly been affected b y the impasse in Parliament, 
wh ich stalled the approval o f the ADP-SP, the Mozambique Interconnector, F Y 0 9 energy 
sector project, and the Public Private Partnership (PPP) bill. There has also been slow 
progress elsewhere in the rehabilitation o f i r r iga t ion schemes, the establishment o f a 

9 

warehouse receipt company, and the general pace o f reform. Further, the ad-hoc setting 
o f prices, export bans, and domestic trade restrictions have undermined the investment 
climate and contributed to a relative decline against peer countries. In addition, there 
were significant fiduciary issues under the Hea l th Sector Support Project that affected the 
processing o f the p ipe l ine projects. 

26. While the strategy remains relevant, the detailed implementation plans for the 

CAS could be modified. I t i s clear that agricultural po l icy i s tightly l inked to the po l i t ica l 
economy o f Ma law i . Therefore improvements in agricultural markets and the investment 
environment - though c ruc ia l - are l i k e l y to be gradual. Over the remaining period o f the 
CAS, the Bank should be prepared to: 

a. Ma in ta in solid, real-time analysis o f agricultural po l icy , so that i t can i n f o rm 
government po l icy mak ing and donors 
b. Broaden performance indicators to include the private sector environment and 
agricultural p roduc t iv i ty (as already commenced in the Common Approach to 
Budget Support (CABS ) framework) 
c. B r i n g forwardaugment projects where opportunities fo r progress exist and be 
prepared to delay projects where the p o l i c y framework requires attention 
(b) Opportunities fo r enhanced I D A support 

27. 

Following the successful IDA 15 replenishment, the IDA resources available to 
Malawi are likely to increase significantly. The i n i t i a l Performance Based A l loca t ion 

fo r M a l aw i fo r IDA 15 fo r the FYO9-12 pe r iod i s SDR288m7. This represents a 
significant increase on the IDA levels fo r FY 0 9 and FYlO expected at the t ime ‘o f w r i t ing 
the CAS. Conditioning o n strong performance, this increase w i l l be absorbed through (a) 
enlarging planned projects; and (b) enhancing Ma law i ’s participation in regional projects, 
as foreseen in the CAS. Any increase in budget support should reflect imp roved po l icy 
performance in agriculture, and improvements in the investment environment.

This a l loca t ion i s ind ica t ive o n l y and can change. O n l y the FY09 and F Y l O allocations are firm. The 
actual a l loca t ion f o r FY11 w i l l depend on: (i) to ta l IDA resources available; (ii) the coun try ’s performance 
rating; (iii) the performance and assistance terms o f other IDA borrowers; ( iv ) the terms o f IDA ’S 
assistance to M a l a w i (grants o r credits); and (v) the number o f ID A - e l i g i b l e countries. IDA allocations are 
made in SDRs based on performance, and US$ equ iva len t i s dependent upon the p reva i l ing exchange rate. 
Finally the terms o f assistance (i.e. grants, credits o r m i x o f the tw o ) w i l l depend on M a l aw i ’ s debt 
sustainability pos i t ion .

D. RISKS 
The risks identified in the CAS remain valid. In particular, recent events have 

28. 
underscored the vulnerability o f progress o n the economic r e f o rm program and fiscal 
discipline to po l i t ica l developments and the electoral cycle. Significant delays have been 
experienced in implementation o f W o r l d Bank and other donor projects, such as the 
Ma law i -Mozamb ique Interconnector and the Ag r icu l tu ra l Development Program Support 
Project. Progress on the agriculture/food security agenda has proven to be pa r t icu la r ly 
vulnerable to considerations o f po l i t ica l economy. Unless better engagement w i t h the 
Government on these issues can n ow be achieved f o l l ow i n g the M a y 2009 elections, CAS 
Outcome 1 w i l l be in jeopardy. 

The global downturn w i l l reduce growth i n 2009, and poses a moderate risk of 

29. 
income shocks over the medium term. Ma law i ’s recent economic success has been 
based on a supply response to imp roved export prices,* coupled w i t h a significantly 
imp roved macroeconomic environment, wh ich has stabilised prices and enabled 
investment to respond to incentives. This improvement in economic performance has 
begun to l i f t significant numbers o f people out o f poverty, but w i l l require sustained 
investment and favourable export prices to continue. The sharp contraction o f advanced 
economies in 2009 presents a risk to economic g row th in M a l aw i through: 

Possible reduction i n export demand. Reduced demand fo r tobacco, sugar or tea 
cou ld adversely affect g row th through lowe r export revenues, a worsening trade 
balance, and the possibly in f la t iona ry effects o f an exchange rate correction. The 
effect o f reduced tobacco demand might be delayed i n t o 2010 i f tobacco 
companies absorb surplus production by b u i l d i n g up o f stocks in 2009. 

Possible reduction i n aid, remittances and foreign direct investment (FDI). 
Further pressure on foreign exchange earnings cou ld be exerted through several 
channels. Firstly, public-sector tightening o r exchange rate movements in donor 
countries cou ld reduce the real domestic value o f aid ( fo r example, the value o f 
DFID’s commitments f e l l b y 25 percent in kwacha terms during 2008). Secondly, 
the rise in OECD unemployment cou ld reduce remittances, wh ich are currently 
estimated at 4 percent o f GDP. Thirdly, i t i s l i k e l y that the downturn and credit 
squeeze w i l l reduce new FDI in M a l aw i in 2009/10. 

30. 
HZWAZDS remains a major threat. In spite o f recent progress, the H I V I A I D S 
pandemic has had a significant impact on the human capital essential fo r Ma law i ’s 
growth. W h i l e recent data on the adult HIV prevalence rate i s encouraging, more wo rk i s 
required t o understand the drivers o f the pandemic, and increasing the effectiveness o f the 
prevention e f fo r t i s essential. The f isca l sustainability o f the An t i -Re t rov i ra l Therapy 
(ART) p rog ram i s also no t assured. 

Particularly tobacco.

ANNEX 3: ANALYSIS OF CAS OUTCOMES 

OUTCOME I: Imp rove smallholder agricultural productivity and integration in to 
agro-processing 

1. 
Agriculture and food security is at the core of the CAS agenda. With agriculture 
accounting fo r over 35 percent o f GDP and over 80 percent o f export earnings and 
employment, increasing smallholder p roduc t iv i ty i s k e y to ensuring household food 
security, boosting rates o f economic g row th and reducing poverty. In 2007, concerns 
about the slow rate o f agricultural g row th and the diversity o f small, short-term 
agricultural projects in the country led the Government to define a new Ag r icu l tu ra l 
Development Program (ADP). T h i s aims to coordinate sectoral investments in to a more 
consistent and results-oriented program. lo The W o r l d Bank supported the i n i t i a l 
formulation o f the ADP, and in 2008, the Boa rd approved the US$32 m i l l i o n Ag r icu l tu ra l 
Development Program Support Project (ADP-SP)." The Results Framework fo r the 
A D P now provides a foundation fo r targeting future donor support fo r agriculture in the 
country. As a comprehensive and strategic approach to the agricultural sector, the ADP 
represents a significant step forward. 

2. 
Improve irrigation and farming practices: Much remains to be done to put 
agriculture in Malawi on a commercial footing. The Bank i s in the i n i t i a l stages o f 
wo rk w i t h the M i n i s t r y o f Ag r icu l tu re and Food Security to develop a project to promote 
more commercialized fa rm ing practices. The M i n i s t r y has so far concentrated on 
achieving national food security, and the commitment o f resources under the ADP-SP, 
the I r r iga t ion and Ru ra l L ive l ihoods Ag r icu l tu ra l Development Project (IRLADP) and the 
Community-Based Ru ra l Land Development Project (CBRLDP ) supports this focus. 
However, the Ministry n ow recognizes the importance o f fac i l i ta t ing the g row th o f 
commercial production and marketing a more diverse range o f crops. The country 
remains dependent on tobacco fo r 60 percent o f i t s foreign exchange earnings. The next 
most important crops are sugar and tea, where p ro f i ts largely accrue to the estate sector. 
The challenge remains 
to broaden income gains through improvements in the 
p roduc t iv i ty o f enterprises such as cotton, coffee, paprika, nuts, vegetables, dairy, pou l t ry 
and fish farming. 

3. 
I t is not yet clear what role expanded irrigation will play in this context. 
Ma law i 's efforts to expand the area under i r r iga t ion remain constrained b y the country's 
l im i t e d engineering capacity, the high cost o f maintaining and rehabilitating existing 
schemes, and d i f f icu l t ies w i t h water management structures. The Bank i s wo rk ing w i t h 
the Government to iden t i fy solutions to these constraints in the year ahead. 

lo The A D P outlines na t iona l e f for ts t o achieve 6 percent growth rates, through a l loca t ion o f at least 15 
percent o f the na t iona l budge t t o the agr icu l tura l sector, as mandated b y the A f r i c a n U n i o n under the 
Comprehensive A f r i c a A g r i c u l t u r a l Deve lopmen t Program. 
'' Effectiveness o f the ADP -SP has been substantially delayed by the p o l i t i c a l impasse in parliament. 

26 

4. 
Improve market incentives for surplus production. The Bank has pursued a two - 
track strategy on grain market reforms: restructuring o f the state marketing board, 
ADM ARC ; and the implementation o f a series o f risk management initiatives. In l i n e 
w i t h the restructuring program approved b y the Cabinet in 2006, A D M A R C has 
streamlined i t s activities b y closing ancillary departments (clinics, ta i lo r ing workshops, 
etc.) and contracting out these services to the p r iva te sector. A D M A R C has sold i t s 
shares in various subsidiary companies, closed down the A D M A R C Investment H o l d i n g 
Company ( A M C ) and l a i d o f f more than 300 staff. Several A D M A R C depots are in the 
process o f be ing passed to a new warehouse leasing company, the M a l aw i Ag r icu l tu ra l 
Warehousing and Trading Company (MAWTCO ) . 

5 . 

Recent government intervention in the maize market indicates that reforms 
aflecting the trade of key commodities remain controversial. Ma ize trade has been 
largely liberalized over the past twenty years. By 2007, the private sector accounted fo r 
the bulk o f trade flows, although the Government remained the dominant stockholder. 
However, many in Government remain concerned about the r i s k s o f complete 
dependence on the private sector t o maintain adequate levels o f grain stocks. Uncertainty 
about the reasons fo r r is ing maize prices in the face o f estimated crop surpluses in 2007 
and 2008 l e d to the re-establishment o f stricter p r ice and trade controls in August 2008; 
private traders were asked to sell their inventories to A DM A R C . These restrictions were 
l i f t e d in M a y 2009 but private traders and stockholders have again seen signals that i t i s 
r isky to engage in this trade and particularly r isky t o h o l d significant stocks. 

6 . 
Strengthen integration and links to input/output markets. The Government’s 
Ag r icu l tu ra l Input Subsidy Program (AISP) has been in operation since the 2005/06 
agricultural season, and aims to help poo r households access fe r t i l ize r and other modem 
inputs to increase farm p roduc t iv i ty . However, the sustainability o f this program has 
been drawn i n t o question by the huge increase in costs during the 2008/09 season. The 
A ISP n ow accounts fo r more than 13 percent o f the national budget, and over 7 0% o f the 
budget o f the Ministry o f Agriculture and Food Security. The AISP has n ow been 
expanded to cover tobacco, cotton, coffee, and tea, in addition to maize. M o r e than one- 
ha l f o f a l l maize seed sold in the country i s n ow distributed through the AISP w i t h a 
100% subsidy. The ma jo r i ty o f fe r t i l ize r sold in M a l aw i i s n ow distributed through the 
AISP w i t h more than a 90% subsidy. W h i l e the private sector impo r ted 80% o f the 
fe r t i l ize r used in the program, most re ta i l sales (in exchange fo r subsidy coupons) take 
place through national parastatals. In 2008, fe r t i l ize r companies were no longer allowed 
to accept subsidy coupons. Input subsidies need t o be better targeted in relation to w e l l 
defined and measurable performance indicators and the subsidy program should be 
contributing to the expansion o f commercial markets fo r agricultural inputs. The Inputs 
fo r Assets e f fo r t under the IRLADP offers a strategy fo r better targeting these subsidies 
toward poorer households. 

7 . 
Establish storage and mitigation measures for food security risks over time. 
The establishment o f the M a l aw i Ag r icu l tu ra l Warehousing and T rad ing Company 
(M AW TCO ) aims to deepen markets in urban and peri-urban areas, and encourage 

27 

A D M A R C to concentrate on ru ra l areas. W h i l e progress has been slow, the 
establishment o f M A W T C O i s progressing: M AW T C O ’ s Memorandum and Articles o f 
Association have been prepared and the incorporation o f M A W T C O i s expected soon. 
The core o f the company’s mandate i s to lease excess warehouse assets currently he ld by 
A D M A R C on the commercial market. This w i l l offset the need fo r the p r iva te sector to 
replicate these assets and encourage the development o f warehousing services. Bank 
support fo r developing the regulatory guidelines fo r a warehouse receipt system 
complements these efforts. 

The Agricultural Development Program highlights better risk management as a 

8. 
key Government objective. The Bank has been do ing pioneering w o r k w i t h the 
Government on macro weather insurance and in September 2008, the Boa rd approved the 
Weather Index De r iva t ive Transaction Agreement, wh ich w i l l a l low the country to offset 
the r i s k s o f severe drought on the national maize crop. The W o r l d Bank p rov ided 
technical support fo r a successful c a l l op t ion unde r ly ing the purchase o f maize imports 
f o l l ow i n g drought in 2005. T h i s i s estimated to have saved the country approximately 
US$80 per ton on impo r t costs. Technical discussions continue on related p r ice hedgin 
options. The Government tendered fo r repurchase (REPO) contracts in 2007 and 2008. 
However, no contracts were u l t ima te ly signed. Continuing technical assistance fo r a 
micro-weather insurance program has l e d to the expansion o f this on a p i l o t scale in the 
tobacco sector, and new interest in further expansion in cotton and tea. I t i s hoped that 
greater experience and confidence in Government in the application o f these various risk 
management tools w i l l reduce the l ike l ihood o f short-term, unpredictable trade controls. 
Support fo r on-going strengthening o f the Government’s agricultural risk management 
capabilities i s being provided b y the Bank’s Commod i ty Risk Management Group under 
the IDA - f inanced ADP-SP.

th rough imp roved in f ras t ruc tu re and investment c l ima te 

Improve energy generation and transport 

9 . 

While there has been little visible progress in the energy sector, a number of 
factors give cause for cautious optimism about longer-term prospects. Qua l i ty o f 

electricity supply was the fou r th most serious constraint fo r businesses, according to the 
2006 Investment Climate Assessment ( ICA ) . The Mozambique-Malawi Transmission 
Interconnector Project to connect M a l aw i to the Southern A f r ican Power Poo l was 
approved b y the W o r l d Bank Boa rd in Ju ly 2007. However, po l i t ica l stalemate in 
Parliament p r io r to the M a y 2009 elections has meant that the credit i s s t i l l awaiting 
Parliamentary approval and subsequent signature. T h i s has also delayed the preparation 

l2 Unde r a REPO agreement, the Governmen t w o u l d have f i rs t rights to purchase stocks h e l d in the coun try 
by the pr iva te sector at an agreed pr ice . Shou ld i t b e established that the coun try w i l l have enough ma ize 
du r ing t h e lean season, the pr iva te sector w o u l d be a l lowed to expor t the grain. U n d e r a c a l l option, the 
Government i s able to l o c k in an im p o r t p r ice f o r g ra in h e l d outside the country, w h i c h i t can c a l l u p o n in 
the event o f a shortage. 

28 

o f the proposed FY 0 9 energy sector project. However, Mozamb ique remains interested 
in an extension o f the interconnector i n t o northern Mozambique, and a full feasibility 
study w i l l be launched shortly. In Ma law i , the power capacity balance w i l l soon ease 
somewhat, f o l l ow i n g the return to service o f Units I and I1 o f the Tedzani hydropower 
scheme. Sector management and governance have imp roved w i t h the establishment in 
2008 o f a new sector regulator, the M a l aw i Energy Regulatory Au tho r i ty (MERA), as 
w e l l as the appointment o f a new CEO at the electricity company ESCOM . Other 
development partners are increasingly interested in the energy sector: the M i l l e n n i um 
Challenge Corporation i s interested in mak ing significant investments, and No rway i s 
setting up a Trust Fund fo r investment in energy projects w i t h regional significance, 
inc lud ing support fo r the Mozambique-Malawi Interconnector and i t s extension in to 
northern Mozambique. 

Developments in transport have also been mixed. The Government has 

10. 
completed a Roads Master plan, but has yet to develop a p r io r i t ized sector p lan in 
transport. The Bank’s Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project (ROMARP), wh ich 
closed in June 2006, established the Roads Database and the Road Fund, and supported 
significant institutional re fo rm o f financing and planning in the roads sector. The 
European Commission, A f r ican Development Bank and M i l l e n n i um Challenge 
Corporation are a l l look ing to make significant investments in the transport sector. The 
Government has asked the Bank to investigate l i n k i n g M a l aw i t o the rehabilitated Sena 
r a i l l ine through Mozambique to the po r t o f Beira, as w e l l as imp rov ing existing l i n k s to 
Nacala port in northern Mozambique. 

11. While the CAS did not 
identify specific milestones regarding water 
infrastructure, coordination and financing of 
the sector has improved markedly. 

Implementation o f the US$50 m i l l i o n Second Na t iona l Water Development Project 
(NWDP I I ) has generally progressed well, but some k e y medium- t o long-term reforms 
envisaged b y the Government have been delayed. The European Un ionEu ropean 
Investment Bank (EU/EIB) loan b i l l (wh ich provides complimentary funds to the 
NWDP I I ) has been approved by Parliament after a delay, and w i l l n ow support the 
development o f a proper ins t i tu t iona l framework fo r sustainable urban water service 
delivery. The water situation i s particularly pressing in the commercial center o f 
Blantyre, where further investments are urgently required to he lp m i t iga te disruptions in 
water supply. Development o f the water sector SWAP i s progressing well; the 
preparation process w i t h k e y donors and sector stakeholders was launched in December 
2008. In addition, the Bank team prepared Ma law i ’s successful application fo r funds 
f r om the A f r ica Catalytic G r ow t h Fund (ACGF). The US$25 m i l l i o n i s be ing used to 
complement investments in town, market center, and ru ra l water sub-sectors, and 
implementation i s progressing well. 

Address policy issues in the investment climate 

Despite some improvements, progress on the investment climate has been weak. 

12. 
One o f the k e y achievements o f Bank support has been the establishment o f a 
Commercial Court in 2007. As o f M a r c h 2008, i t took an average o f 125 days to settle 

29 

commercial disputes, significantly be low the target o f 290 days fo r 2008. However, 
Ma law i ’s pos i t ion in the D o i n g Business rankings deteriorated in 2007, 2008 and 2009, 
reflecting the slow pace o f re fo rm relative to other ~ 0 u n t r i e s . l ~ At the current pace o f 
reform, the CAS Outcome Indicators and Milestones related to the business climate w i l l 
no t be achieved (see Results Ma t r ix ) . In addition, ad hoc government interventions in the 
maize and fe r t i l ize r markets continue t o undermine business confidence and discourage 
private sector activity. 

13. 

A Public Private Partnership (PPP) B i l l was published by the Government of 
Malawi in August 2008. This was an agreed dated covenant o f the Business 
Environment Strengthening Technical Assistance Project (BESTAP). However, the b i l l 
has yet to be submitted to Parliament fo r approval. A draft PPP p o l i c y framework i s 
scheduled to be submitted to Cabinet fo r approval and a PPP unit i s n ow located in the 
Privatization Commission. 

14. 
At the Government’s request, the Bank completed a Financial Sector 
Assessment Program (FSAP) and a Corporate Governance Report on the Observance 
of Standards and Codes (ROSC). Bo th the FSAP and the Corporate Governance ROSC 
have been concluded and the Government has been receptive to their k e y messages. 
Results o f the 2006 Investment Climate Assessment ( ICA ) have been fed in to the d ra f t ing 
process o f the new Private Sector Development (PSD) Po l icy and Strategy and were also 
used in the design o f BESTAP. 

15. 
The I F C is also supporting the Government’s efforts to improve the business 
climate. LFC technical assistance contributed to the establishment o f the new Commercial 
Cou r t and i s supporting wo rk towards a new licensing regime. The IFC ’s Sma l l and 
M e d i um Enterprises (SME) Enterprise Development In i t ia t ive worked w i t h the M a l aw i 
Expo r t Promotion Counc i l (MEPC) on a countrywide sector mapping exercise to iden t i fy 
SME export opportunities, and on the production o f an SME exporter handbook, 
completed in November 2008. l4 

Improve access to finance 

16. 
SMEs have started accessing matching grants which are facilitating business 
growth and improving access to financing. The Business G row th Scheme (BUGS), 
under BESTAP includes a US$1.8 m i l l i o n Business Development Services fund. F r om 
this fund BUGS reimburses 50 percent o f costs incurred by SMEs in accessing finance 
(through the preparation o f business plans, feasibility studies, market research etc.), up to 
a max imum o f US$50,000. W h i l e the number o f grants made (89) i s be low the expected 

l3 Ma law i slipped f rom 106 in the Ease o f Do ing Business ranking in 2006, to 110 in 2007, 131 in 2008 and 
again to 134 in 2009. 
l4 The handbook i s a comprehensive guide to the export process in Malawi, containing relevant contacts, 
transportation details, business development services, export documentation templates, trade agreements 
and other information. I t w i l l be handed over to the MEPC to be updated on an annual basis and distributed 
to exporters for a nominal fee. 

30 

level, the engagement o f additional staff and imp roved promotion i s expected to increase 
SME uptake. 

17. 
The I FC is seeking to increase its engagement in Ma law i , focusing on 
investments and advisory activities that help d ive rs i fy the economy, develop the M i c r o , 
Sma l l and M e d i um Enterprise (MSME ) sector and improve access to finance. The IFC i s 
in discussions to comm i t US$1.5 m i l l i o n to H o t e l V ic to r ia in Blantyre. In June 2008, the 
IFC committed US$5 m i l l i o n to Bakhresa Ma law i , a f lou r milling company, and US$3 
m i l l i o n was committed to NBS Bank in F Y 0 8 under the MSME program. The IFC’s 
G loba l Trade Finance Program (GTFP) in M a l a w i seeks to a) expand available financing 
and reduce the need fo r cash collateralized transactions; b) provide longer maturities than 
currently available; and c) deliver technical assistance and t ra in ing t o imp rove operating 
standards. In M a y 2008, a US $ lOm i l l i o n GTFP l ine was signed w i t h First Merchant 
Bank. 

18. 
The I F C is exploring the inclusion of three more banks in the Global Trade 
Finance Program. A US$7 m i l l i o n trade l i n e to NBS Bank was approved by December 
2008, wh i le i n i t i a l discussions towards s im i la r lines to Na t iona l Bank o f M a l aw i and 
Ecobank M a l aw i are underway. The IFC i s also in discussions w i t h mob i le telecom 
company Za in and loca l banks fo r a risk-sharing fac i l i ty to increase access t o finance f o r 
Zain’s distributors. This fo l lows an IFC commitment in F Y 0 7 o f US$15 m i l l i o n to Za in 
Ma law i , as part o f a multi-country fac i l i ty . 

19. 
Given the slow pace of reform by Ma law i and the country’s deteriorating global 
ranking in the Doing Business Survey, there is a need for greater government 
commitment to the investment climate reform agenda. 
In the short term, i t w i l l be 
important to ensure that the PPP B i l l i s submitted and passed b y Parliament, in addition 
to numerous other outstanding pieces o f legislation. 

OUTCOME 111: Decrease vulnerability a t the household level f rom H IV IA IDS and 
ma lnu t r i t ion 

Improved H IV /A ID s awareness, access to drugs and treatment 

20. 
Good progress has been made increasing awareness of H I V I A I D S and 
improving access to. treatment. T h e number o f people living w i t h HIVIAIDS receiving 
anti-retroviral therapy (ART) has imp roved f r om around 57,000 in 2006 to over 140,000 
people b y December 2008. T h i s treatment coverage rate i s one o f the highest in h igh - 
prevalence IDA countries in Southern A f r ica . S im i la r progress was achieved in 
increasing the number o f HIV testing and counseling sites, and the number o f people 
being tested. In 2001, there were on ly 14 sites o f fe r ing testing and counseling services. 
Acco rd ing to the Ministry o f Health, there are currently 410 sites in Ma law i . Over 20 
percent o f orphans and other vulnerable children are receiving free external support 
(medical, psychosocial o r material) and, given underreporting, the actual figure i s l i k e l y 
to be considerably higher. 

31 

21. 
A follow-on operation for the H I V / A I D S Pooled Financing operation is 
planned. As outlined in the CAS, the Bank has discontinued i t s financing in the health 
sector and the Bank’s con t r ibu t ion t o the M a l aw i Hea l th Sector-Wide Approach (SWAp) 
closed, as planned, in September 2008. However, a US$30 m i l l i o n operation i s being 
designed as Add i t iona l Financing to the o r ig ina l HIV/ADDS project. This operation w i l l 
support and strengthen the national response to HIV/AlDS in Ma law i , in l i n e w i t h the 
Government’s Na t iona l Ac t ion Framework, and finance a further three years o f a national 
program. I t w i l l contribute f inanc ia l ly towards the implementation o f the j o i n t program 
o f wo rk w i t h i n the HIV/AIDS SWAp, wh ich i s co-financed b y mu l t ip le donors and the 
Government o f Ma law i . P r io r i ty w i l l be given to ensuring that the momentum developed 
in HIV testing and treatment continues, and that more e f fo r t i s placed o n supporting 
evidence-based prevention strategies. 

Nutrition 

22. 
Malawi is still lacking a coherent and integrated approach to nutrition. A 
nationwide awareness and in fo rma t ion campaign has promoted good feeding practices fo r 
under-5 and school-age children. Sector wo rk i s underway t o p rov ide a basis fo r a 
nu t r i t ion program; the Bank has in i t ia ted wo rk o n a multi-partner study examining 
determinants o f in fan t and c h i l d feeding practices in M a l aw i and consultations have 
begun w i t h the Government. Other development partners, fo r example Ireland, have 
indicated willingness to provide financial support t o a nu t r i t ion program, and assuming 
program development goes ahead, IDA w i l l also consider financing this under the next 
CAS. 

Soc ia l Protection Program 

23. 
The World Bank is supporting the development and implementation of a 
comprehensive social protection strategy. The Bank i s funding three social protection 
interventions to help offset the worst instances o f poverty. The Bank approved the new 
M a l aw i Social Ac t ion Fund (MASAF ) 3 APL 11, wh ich w i l l p rov ide US$35 m i l l i o n to 
support a pub l ic works cash transfer program through loca l government, to assist up to 
600,000 households to purchase agricultural inputs, grains, and other basic necessities in 
the event o f food security-related shocks. With funding f r om the B u i l d i n g Resilient 
Communities Trust Fund, the Bank supported the development o f a Social Support Po l icy 
to promote an integrated approach to social protection investments. The p o l i c y has been 
discussed by Cabinet, and the Na t iona l Social Protection Committee i s now rev iew ing i t 
to incorporate Cabinet comments and consulting w i t h relevant ministries. The revised 
document w i l l be returned to Cabinet fo r approval. Look ing forward, cabinet approval o f 
a social protection program, wh ich identifies instruments fo r the implementation o f the 
Social Support Policy, w i l l be a p r i o r i t y in 2009. Finally, the M u l t i -D o n o r Trust Fund o f 
the G loba l Fac i l i ty fo r Disaster Reduction and Recovery: Track 2 fo r M a l a w i i s p rov id ing 
technical assistance to the Government o f M a l aw i to mainstream disaster risk reduction 
in strategic planning and sectoral development policies. 

32 

OUTCOME I V : Sustain improvements in expenditure management, transparency 
and accountability 

Institutional system for accountability and transparency 

24. Malawi’s macroeconomic program has progressed well over the past three years 

but is now at risk of going off-track. M a l aw i achieved three consecutive years o f good 
macroeconomic management through the implementation o f an IMF-sponsored Poverty 
Reduction and G row th Fac i l i ty (PRGF). The sixth and f i n a l rev iew o f the PRGF was 
approved b y the Boa rd o f the IMF on Ju ly 14, 2008. In December 2008, the IMF Boa rd 
approved a one year program, the Exogenous Shocks Fac i l i ty (ESF), to support 
adjustment to the terms o f trade shocks caused by rap id increases in f u e l and fe r t i l ize r 
prices in 2008. The Fund plans to discuss a new program w i t h the authorities f o l l ow i n g 
the recent elections. However, at the t ime o f writing, the ESF p rog ram was at risk o f 
going off-track, due to significant additional purchases o f fe r t i l ize r fo r the subsidy 
program w i thou t secured financing and uncertainty surrounding the W o r l d Bank’s PRSC- 
2 funding, after appraisal cou ld not be successfully c0nc1uded.l~ As a result, the 
domestic bo r row ing target may be missed. 

25. With increased staffing levels, and the appointment of an Auditor General, the 
National Audit Office has been working on clearing the backlog in the submission of 

audit reports. The capacity o f the Na t iona l Audit O f f ice (NAO ) has been strengthened 
by the recruitment in 2007 o f 60 new assistant auditors and 20 interns. As a result, more 
Government entities are n ow be ing audited. There has also been an improvement in the 
timeliness w i t h wh ich external audits are being conducted and submitted to Parliament. 
T h i s i s pa r t ly because, since the r o l l out o f the Integrated F inanc ia l Management 
In fo rma t ion System ( IFM IS ) in 2005, there has been a significant improvement in the 
preparation o f accounts at the end o f the financial year, and pa r t ly because o f the 
appointment o f a new Aud i to r General in July 2008. The post o f Aud i to r General, who 
must legally sign o f f o n Audit Reports before they are submitted to the legislature, 
remained vacant f o r a long pe r iod during po l i t ica l wrangling over the appointment. The 
2004/05 and 2005/06 Audit Reports have now been submitted t o Parliament, and the 
2006/07 Report i s expected soon. As the financial statements fo r the 2007/08 f isca l year 
were submitted p romp t ly towards the end o f November (only one mon th over the 
statutory requirement), the auditing process w i l l soon be up-to-date. 

26. While considerable progress has been made on capacity development in internal 

audit, significant challenges remain. Commitment and support f r om the Government 
fo r the internal audit func t ion have increased over the past tw o years. A l l ministries n ow 
have internal audit units (IAUs) and internal audit committees (IACs), but so far o n l y 12 

~ 

l5 Appraisal of t h e second Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC-2) could not be concluded because: 
(i) two key prior actions had not been met; ( i i) the Government had not finalized a new le t te r of 
development policy; and ( i i i ) there was need for further clarification from the Government on the 
expansion of the f e r t i l i z e r subsidy program, given the risk i t poses to the macroeconomic program, which i s 
a fundamental requirement of the PRSC. 

33 

o f the largest ministries (out o f the to ta l 2 0 ) have func t iona l I AC s wh ich ac t ive ly meet. 
This ensures coverage o f about 60% o f pub l ic expenditures. There i s a c r i t ica l need to 
expand coverage in a l l ministries and in the ma jo r pub l ic enterprises. W h i l e the capacity 
and reputation o f the Central Internal Audit Unit has increased substantially, many 
ins t i tu t iona l barriers continue to undermine in te rna l controls. M a j o r challenges include: 
(i) retention o f trained staff; (ii) support o f the internal audit functions by management in 
the various ministries, especially the func t ion ing o f IACs ; (iii) action o n audit findings i s 
s t i l l ad hoc and has a weak legislative basis; and (iv) delays in the passage o f the 
Amendment B i l l through Parliament to strengthen the in te rna l audit func t ion w i t h i n the 
Public Financial Management Act. 

The Government has taken measures to strengthen control of the payroll. In 

27. 
September 2006, the Government introduced a new system fo r managing personnel and 
pay ro l l records, the Human Resource Management In fo rma t ion System (HRMIS). The 
system ensures that pay ro l l data i s automatically updated fo l low ing a change to personnel 
data and was expected to reduce the problems o f ghost workers, inaccurate wage 
projections, and unauthorized allowances, recruitments, promotions, and wage increases. 
A database o f a l l Government employees was comp i led in 2006 and reconciled w i t h 
pay ro l l records. Consultants were engaged t o conduct the review o f the in teg r i ty o f 
HRMIS and an inception report was produced and accepted b y the O f f ice o f the President 
and Cabinet. Further, tw o personnel audits covering the whole pub l ic service phys ica l ly 
ve r i f ied the existence o f each staff member and updated the personnel database. 

Substantial progress has been made in procurement capacity building. There 

28. 
has been significant investment in training o f procurement staff o f a l l levels (see Results 
Ma t r ix ) . S ix officers w i t h postgraduate qualifications were seconded t o the M a l aw i 
Polytechnic to support the design and teaching o f a Bachelor’s degree in Logistics and 
Supply Chain Management, offered f r om M a y 2008, to p rov ide a domestic and regional 
hub f o r pub l ic procurement training. 

29. 

Looking forward, the Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) series is 
continuing to focus on improving the budget process, payroll management, debt 

management, and external auditing. The PRSC i s supporting measures to imp rove the 
linkage between the MGDS (Ma law i ’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP)) and 
the national budget, in order to ensure that a l l national budgets are consistent w i t h the 
medium-term p r io r i ty development objectives and strategies outlined in the MGDS. The 
PRSC w i l l also continue to support initiatives to imp rove pay ro l l management, w i t h a 
focus on recommendations f r om the HRMIS rev iew and the personnel audit. On debt 
management, the PRSC w i l l be supporting measures to imp rove coordination between the 
Ministry o f Finance and the Reserve Bank o f Ma law i . F ina l ly , w i t h regard to external 
auditing, the focus w i l l be on fo l low -up o f audit reports. 

Intergovernmental fatal and expenditure management 
Goodprogress has been made on decentralization. A Loca l Development Fund 

30. 
(LDF) has been developed, t o be managed b y the M i n i s t r y o f Finance, implemented by 

34 

the Ministry o f Loca l Government and Ru ra l Development and monitored b y the 
Na t iona l L o c a l Government Finance Committee. The M i n i s t r y o f Finance agreed in 
2008 to lead coordination efforts to a l ign the use o f government funds w i t h donor 
resources to finance services at the community and L o c a l Assembly levels, w i t h a v iew to 
achieving greater efficiency and effectiveness in service delivery. 
In a further step 
forward, MASAF I11 has been incorporated in to the pub l ic financing system. L o o k i n g 
ahead, f ina l iz ing the design o f an Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfer System that enables 
Loca l Assemblies to p lan and implement investments targeted at poverty reduction 
should be a p r io r i ty .
