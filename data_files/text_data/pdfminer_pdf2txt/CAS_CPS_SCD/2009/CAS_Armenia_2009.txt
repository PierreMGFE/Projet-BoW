Executive Summary 

i. 
The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Armenia for FY09-12 has been prepared 
against the background of a severe global economic crisis.  The strategy focuses on the near term 
needs of addressing vulnerability and mitigating the adverse economic and social effects of the 
crisis as well as strengthening the foundations for medium term competitiveness and growth.  

ii. 
Over the past dozen years, Armenia experienced double-digit rates of growth in GDP, 
amidst low inflation.   Macroeconomic policies were supportive, with fiscal deficits being small, 
and monetary and exchange rate policies were prudent.  The authorities pursued a steady 
program of structural reforms which has led to Armenia being ranked consistently as a top IDA 
performer.  The reforms were centered on sharpening competition, improving governance, and 
mitigating social and environmental risks.  The economy today is market-oriented and highly 
open to trade, capital, and technological innovation.  

iii. 
Even as Armenia benefited from greater openness, those same channels have now 
transmitted the global crisis to its economy.  A loss of export demand, a collapse of commodity 
export prices, and a sharp decline in remittances and private capital flows have occurred.  GDP is 
projected to contract by 8 percent in 2009 with significant downside risks. 

iv. 
The authorities have responded swiftly to the economic crisis.  First, in order to restore 
external balance, the central bank returned to a flexible exchange rate regime in March 2009.  
Second, the government has re-prioritized its expenditures towards those that protect or create 
jobs in the short term and towards social programs, especially the well targeted safety net.  Third, 
the authorities have sought external donor flows to offset lower private capital inflows and 
budget revenues and to target them into projects and programs that will complement the anti-
crisis measures. 

v. 
The framework for medium tern structural reforms is provided by the Sustainable 
Development Program (2008) -- Armenia ’s second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper.  The 
Program has three key goals: reducing poverty, including the elimination of extreme poverty; 
ensuring human development; and deepening economic growth.    

vi. 
The CPS is directly aligned with this Program.  It is anchored on the two strategic 
objectives of mitigating vulnerability and strengthening medium-term competitiveness.  It also 
exercises selectivity and progressively disengages from areas where reform or investment needs 
have been substantially satisfied or where other donors can lead, or where the country has 
adequate internal knowledge and capacity.  The CPS envisages increasing reliance upon 
leveraging other development partners.  It responds to the government's request to front-load 
IDA and IBRD resources over FY09-10, consistent with existing rules, in order to respond 
promptly to the effects of the international crisis.   

vii. 
The CPS presents an integrated strategy for the World Bank Group.  It reflects Armenia ’s 
transition to IDA/IBRD blend status from fiscal year 2009, as well as the full integration of the 
IFC program for the country.  The strategy envisages full use of the IDA-15 envelope (projected 
at $150 million), the IBRD lending limit of $395 million over this four fiscal year period, as well 

iv 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
as projected IFC commitments in the range of $120-160 million.  This assistance effort is 
supported by a far-reaching program of advisory services and trust fund support.    

viii. A lending program averaging five operations per year is proposed with a strong 
implementation focus, and supported by a rich AAA program.  Over the CPS period, a series of 
three development policy operations will provide an anchor for policy and institutional reforms.  
The AAA program contains core diagnostic studies and economic and sector work to design and 
implement the crisis response, strengthen the capacity for improved governance as well as 
provide detailed advice on the next generation of reforms.  Moreover, the CPS is embedded in a 
results framework, utilizes outcome indicators and will, in turn, endeavor to deepen the results-
orientation culture within the country.   

ix. 
The Bank’s work on governance and anti-corruption will be cross-cutting in nature, with 
dialogue focused on the key, critical pre-conditions for success with an overall governance 
strategy that will address political economy factors.  IFC will support transparency in the 
business climate through its advisory work on the business enabling environment and possible 
engagements on corporate governance issues.   

x. 
The IFC and IDA/IBRD find that joint approaches and programs would have a 
particularly high pay-off over the CPS period in the finance, business enabling environment, and 
infrastructure sectors.  The Bank Group is strongly committed to harmonizing its assistance with 
country systems and coordinating its activities with other development partners.  On the former, 
the Bank will build capacity; on the latter, close discussions with key multilateral and bilateral 
partners as well as the government lead to a structured allocation across partners of advisory and 
investment tasks in support of long term development. 

• 

Staff would appreciate guidance from Executive Directors on 
 Are the critical development challenges appropriately discussed in the CPS and does the 
twin pillar structure of support provide the best response? 
• Are the key CPS principles of selectivity, flexibility, leveraging partners and front-loading 
of resources appropriate? 
Is the proposed program of Bank Group support responsive to the needs arising from the 
crisis as well as medium term investment needs?  
Is the results framework realistic and does it provide for sufficient accountability?

ARMENIA: COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 

I. 

The Country Context 

A. 

Introduction 

1. 
This Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Armenia has been prepared in the context of 
the global economic crisis and its impact on the country.  It focuses on the near term needs of 
addressing vulnerability and mitigating the adverse poverty effects of the crisis as well as laying the 
foundation for promoting medium term competitiveness and growth.  

2. 
The CPS for FY09-12 presents an integrated strategy for the World Bank Group.  It reflects 
Armenia’s transition to IDA/IBRD blend status from fis cal year 2009, as well as the full integration of the 
IFC program for the country.  With income per head that averaged $3,200 over 2006-08, Armenia ranks 
as a lower middle-income country.  This Country Partnership Strategy envisages full use of the IDA-15 
envelope (projected at $150 million), the IBRD lending limit of $395 million over this four fiscal year 
period, as well as projected IFC commitments in the range of $120-160 million.  This assistance effort is 
supported by a far-reaching program of advisory services and trust fund support.    

3. 
The country’s economic transformation since the collapse of the Soviet Union has been 
profound.  The economy today is market-oriented, highly open to trade, capital, and technological 
innovation, and is based on services (particularly construction), light industry, and metals, although a 
significant share of the population is still dependent on agriculture.  GDP expanded by double-digit rates 
annually over the past dozen years, with growth led by non-tradables and fuelled by high remittances and 
capital inflows.  Macroeconomic policies were supportive, with fiscal deficits being small and monetary 
and exchange rate policies being prudent.  Inflation was kept low, the overall size of the government was 
restrained as private initiative was permitted to drive the economy, and public external debt was also 
extremely low.  Rising budget revenues were directed at raising real spending on public provision of 
public goods and services.   

4. 
The authorities pursued a steady program of structural reforms which has led to Armenia 
being ranked consistently as a top IDA performer over the last several years. The reforms were 
centered on sharpening competition, improving governance, and mitigating social and environmental 
risks.  The scope of the market economy was greatly extended, regulatory reforms in banking and in 
public utilities yielded efficiency gains, public financial management was strengthened, far-reaching 
reforms to improve efficiency and quality of social services were pursued, and the rural economy and 
environment institutions reformed.  As a result of growth, reforms and external inflows (remittances and 
capital), poverty plunged over the past decade.   

5. 
Even as Armenia benefited from greater openness to global trade and investment, those 
same channels have now transmitted the current global economic crisis to its economy.    The 
country has been struck by three simultaneous shocks—loss of export demand, a collapse of commodity 
export prices, and a sharp decline in remittances and private capital flows.  Exports and economic growth 
began to contract from the final quarter of 2008.  GDP is projected to contract by 8 percent in 2009 with 
significant downside risks. As a result, budgetary revenues have begun to fall sharply and poverty and 
social vulnerability is expected to rise sharply in 2009.   

1 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6. 
The central challenge for the authorities is to mitigate the economic and social impacts of 
the current economic crisis, which are likely to persist for several years, while also laying the 
foundations for rapid post-crisis recovery and growth.  With limited domestic resources, the primary 
short-term focus has to be to address current crisis needs and seek to leverage donor funding to support a 
modest fiscal stimulus, boost domestic investments, especially for job creation, and scale up targeted 
social safety net programs.  At the same time, being a small open economy, Armenia’s future is 
inextricably linked to that of the global economy and its best strategy is to be prepared to take full 
advantage of the eventual global recovery.   

7. 
This severe exogenous economic shock has abruptly broken the momentum of over a decade 
of double-digit growth and social progress.  Despite low internal and external debt burdens, the 
capacity of a small open economy such as that of Armenia to use fiscal space to substitute public sector 
demand for the private sector contraction and support output is constrained.  Thus, in addition to the own-
efforts of the country to mitigate the impact of the international crisis, stepped-up donor support will be 
required, importantly for filling fiscal and external financing gaps as well as supporting the public 
investment program.   

8. 
The proposed Country Partnership Strategy for FY09-12 is therefore anchored in the two 
strategic objectives of mitigating vulnerability and strengthening medium-term competitiveness.  A 
variety of Bank instruments will be used to support the strategy.  This strategy is strongly supported by 
the client who values the Bank group as a valued development partner for addressing its complex 
development needs.   Recognizing that the country’s development strategy and the Bank’s support to it 
are challenged by the uncertainties surrounding the depth and duration of the global economic crisis, and 
the international policy response, frontloading of resources, flexibility in the design, timing, and 
sequencing of lending interventions, and enhanced implementation support will be essential.  

9. 
Several principles will consequently guide the proposed CPS. First, there is direct alignment 
with Armenia’s national Sustainable Development Program which is being revised to take account of the 
current international conditions.  In particular, Bank strategy will seek to address the urgent while staying 
focused on the important medium-term issues.  Second, the Bank Group must exercise selectivity and 
progressively disengage from areas where reform or investment needs have been substantially satisfied or 
where other donors can lead, or where the country has adequate internal knowledge and capacity.  Third, 
the Bank Group will increasingly rely upon leveraging other development partners given competing 
demands on IBRD resources and the Region’s admini strative budget.  Fourth, the CPS responds to the 
government's request to front-load IDA and IBRD resources over FY09-10, consistent with existing 
rules, in order to respond promptly to the effects of the international crisis.   

B. 

The Political Context 

10. 
The last CAS period (FY05-08) was characterized by relative political stability, but the 
situation is evolving.  This stability was reflected in the continuity in office of the President of the 
Republic and of a stable coalition in parliament that provided strong backing for the reformist agenda laid 
out in the first Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper of 2004.  In contrast, the presidential elections in 2008 
were controversial and unresolved tensions with the opposition exist.  There has occurred an erosion of 
external support from some of Armenia’s longstandi ng international partners, who would like to see 
decisive action to improve credibility of the electoral process, strengthen mechanisms of voice and 
accountability, and improved governance. 

11. 
The current economic crisis presents difficult choices and places a premium on the 
importance of fostering broad political consensus.  The new government’s socioeconomic program is 
presented in the second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, entitled the Sustainable Development Program 

2 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(SDP, October 2008), which was developed with extensive social participation, but before the impacts of 
the global economic slowdown began to unfold fully in Armenia.  The SDP set ambitious targets for 
further reductions in poverty, deepening human capital and modernizing the economy, in a context of 
continued GDP growth.  The re-formulation of the program now, under conditions of much weaker 
international growth and financial inflows, will require hard choices in public expenditures and external 
debt strategies; and thus there will be significant demands on the government to develop a broad 
consensus on these choices.   

12. 
However, the regional political context offers new opportunities.  The recent agreement on a 
road map towards normalization of relations with Turkey1 and intensified efforts to end the frozen 
conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh with Azerbaijan are encouraging developments.  Resolution of 
differences with these two neighbors would allow Armenia to reap the potential of eased transport and 
transit links, lower costs to trade, and enable possible participation in regional transit and energy corridor 
developments. The geo-political stability of the South Caucasus would also be greatly improved and the 
perception of investment risks reduced.   

13. 
Armenia is also pursuing a deepening of relations with the European Union and its member 
states, while continuing to maintain strong links with other traditional bilateral partners.  Through 
instruments such as the EU’s Eastern Partnership and steps towards negotiating a free trade agreement 
with the EU (a notable agreement on civil aviation services with the EU was negotiated in 2008), the 
country will be able to raise standards and modernize across a wide range of activities, strengthen 
competition, and obtain a political anchor, thereby countervailing its current isolation.   

C. 

Recent Economic Developments 

14. 
Armenia’s macroeconomic performance during th e past CAS period was robust (Table 1).  
Economic growth has been sustained at double-digit level over the past dozen years, and averaged over 
12 percent annually over the last CAS period (2004-2008).  Growth was supported by a highly favorable 
external environment, macroeconomic stability, and some strengthening in economic governance. The 
construction and service sectors became the largest contributor to growth, and exports played a 
diminished role.  Inflation remained in the single digits despite fuel and food price shocks, assisted by a 
prudent fiscal stance (deficits averaged 1½ percent of GDP over the CAS period), but the underlying 
structural fiscal position did not improve because of continued weaknesses in tax administration.  Fiscal 
deficits have been financed overwhelmingly through external concessional borrowing; thus, domestic 
debt is small.  The monetary stance was disciplined and the dram appreciated substantially both in 
nominal terms and real terms.  This real appreciation in combination with strong rise in domestic 
absorption led to widening trade and current account deficits.  

1 The key elements of the road map are mutual recognition of present frontiers, diplomatic recognition and re-
opening of borders, agreements to foster trade and transport links, and establishment of a joint commission to 
examine historical events.

15. 
Rapid economic growth was driven by foreign savings, reflected in a widening of the 
current account deficit, but domestic savings also rose significantly.  The current account deficit in 
relation to GDP exceeded 11 percent in 2008 compared to less than 2 percent in 2006.  A decline in 
export volumes began in 2006, but growing prices for non-ferrous metals, a main export for Armenia, 
helped to mask poor export performance. In contrast, import growth both in volume and value terms was 
very strong in recent years driven by strong remittances, FDI, commercial bank external borrowing and a 
large real exchange rate appreciation.   The strength of the capital account led to the maintenance of a 
comfortable level of gross international reserves throughout the CAS period.  The authorities pursued a 
prudent external debt management strategy with no public sector borrowing on commercial terms; as a 
result, the external debt level was maintained at modest levels.  Moreover, the sharp and sustained real 
appreciation of the currency together with strong economic growth led to a marked decline in the external 
public debt to GDP ratio. 

D. 

Macroeconomic Prospects and Debt Sustainability 

16. 
Strong economic fundamentals – low debt, ris ing savings and a cautious fiscal stance -- 
shielded the economy from the initial effects of the global output slowdown and the financial crisis, 
but the effects of falling external demand began to be felt from the final quarter of 2008.  A marked 
slowdown in remittances and capital inflows is occurring (Table 2), especially in light of the close 
economic and investment linkages with Russia.  The contraction in real output and the ruble devaluation 
is leading to a large fall in dollar GDP in Russia.  Armenia is highly dependent on remittances ($2 billion 
or 17 percent of GDP) and FDI ($940 million)2. These total almost $3 billion, with about three-quarters of 
these amounts originating in Russia.  Exports have weakened because of sharply declining prices of non-
ferrous metals and plummeting external demand.  Domestic profitability in mining has been severely 
squeezed.

As a result, economic contraction is now projected to be 8 percent in 2009 and a further 2 
percent in 2010 (Table 2).  An even sharper contraction in 2009 cannot be ruled out, depending on the 
severity of external developments.   In recent years, growth has been heavily based on an expanding 
construction and domestic services sectors fuelled by remittances and FDI.  The real estate sector has 
already begun to contract, as has metallurgy, and signals are emerging that other sectors (e.g. Armenia’s 
small but growing IT industry) are also under stress.  The recent depreciation of the currency in real terms 
will encourage a shift of resources to the tradables sector.  Unemployment has risen sharply in recent 
months, as numerous mines have been closed, construction industry activity has dropped sharply, and 
migrants working abroad have returned home for lack of employment opportunities outside the country, 
putting further pressure on the rural economy, social safety net and tax receipts alike.  The budget for 
2009 is being revised in light of changing conditions.  Revenues are projected to fall by 6 percent in 2009 
in relation to 2008; thus, the revenue shortfall compared to the original 2009 budget passed by parliament 
may amount to 4 percent of GDP.  Income per head is projected to fall sharply in 2009-103 (returning to 
the 2007 level) before picking up again.    The low level of economic activity is expected to moderate 
inflation and to lead to a stable (if still large) external current account deficit.     

18. 
  Due to significant reforms in earlier years, the banking system is sound, although financial 
intermediation is still shallow and there has been a rapid growth in external borrowing in recent 

3 This sharp fall (see table 2) reflects not only the economic contraction but also the substantial depreciation of the 
currency – in PPP terms the decline would be moderate.

years.  In a bid to support strong lending growth, banks' external borrowings increased ten-fold from end-
2005 to end-2008.  During the same period, the loan-to-deposit ratio increased from 105 percent to 184 
percent, with bank lending being funded through external sources, largely through international 
organizations or foreign parent banks – a less volatile source than commercial sources.  Looking forward, 
Armenian banks will need to develop new, domestic funding sources to supplement their liquidity and 
support further loan growth in the face of a less favorable external environment.  Re-dollarization has 
been rapid in the four months to March 2009, and as a result of weakness in dram deposits, dram credit 
has become scarce.  The banking system is, however, well capitalized (on average capital to asset ratio is 
27 percent), the open foreign exchange position is small, end-borrowers are not exposed to currency risk, 
and stress tests show that the system is robust.   

19. 
The authorities have responded swiftly to the economic crisis.  First, in order to restore 
external balance, the central bank returned to a flexible exchange rate regime in March 2009.  This 
followed a de facto fixed exchange rate policy relative to the dollar during the previous four months with 
the intent of providing support to the banking sector, but with consequent losses in net international 
reserves amounting to half a billion dollars.  With the floating of the dram, the currency rapidly stabilized 
at a rate that represented a depreciation of about 20 percent vis-à-vis the dollar.  With respect to 
currencies of other major trading partners, the dram appreciated versus the ruble over this four month 
period and modestly depreciated versus the euro (Figure 1).   

20. 
Second, the government has re-prioritized its expenditures towards those that protect or create 
jobs in the short term (such as public investment program) and towards social programs, especially the 
well targeted safety net.  It has deferred non-priority current expenditures.  Measures to improve the 
efficiency of public expenditures and tax collections continue to be pursued.  Third, the authorities have 
sought external donor flows to offset lower private capital inflows and budgetary receipts, and to target 
them into projects and programs that will complement the authorities’ anti-crisis measures. In March 
2009, Armenia obtained a standby arrangement with the IMF in the amount of $540 million of which 
$350 million is projected to be disbursed this year to support international reserves.  The projected ex ante 
budget support needs of around $200 million annually over 2009-10 are projected to be met through 
budget support operations from IDA/IBRD, ADB and Russia.  These initiatives have been undertaken 
within a sound policy regime, including open trade policies.

Despite the external shocks and larger external borrowing than originally anticipated, the 
debt outlook continues to be favorable with a low risk of debt distress. External public and publicly-
guaranteed debt in relation to GDP fell from 33 percent in 2004 to 13 percent at the end of 2008.  With a 
growth in the share of debt on commercial terms as well as the projected volume of borrowing, the ratio 
of external public debt to GDP may reach 30 percent by 2012.  This level is projected to be prudent.  Debt 
service will remain modest in relation to both external earnings and fiscal revenues.    

E. 

The Poverty Profile 

22. 
Economic growth has resulted in falling poverty: the incidence of poverty fell from around 
56 percent in 1998 to about 35 percent in 2004 and further declined to 25 percent in 2007 (Figure 
1).3  These developments are attributable to strong reform efforts in transition, steps taken to create an 
improved business climate, as well as a sharp increase in real wages, private transfers from abroad, and 
rising social transfers made possible because of an increasingly strong fiscal position.

23. 
Extreme poverty declined even faster, from about 6.4 percent in 2004 to less than 4 percent 
in 2007.  Moreover, poverty has become shallower and less severe as the poverty gap and the severity of 
poverty have declined considerably faster. But, significant pockets of poverty still remain.  However, a 
recently completed poverty mapping report highlighted the striking disparity in poverty rates across the 

3 Social Snapshot and Poverty in Armenia 2008, the National Statistical Service of the Republic of Armenia, 
February, 2008.  The national poverty line corresponds to AMD 23,168 per adult equivalent per month (about 
US$75) in 2007 prices

regions.  The spatial disparities in poverty incidence and the pace of poverty reduction suggest that the 
benefits of recent economic growth have not been evenly distributed across the country.   

24. 
Rising unemployment and falling remittances as a result of the crisis are likely to reverse 
some of the gains in poverty. The increase is exacerbated by the disproportionately higher impact of the 
crisis on the construction and mining sectors.  The main ways through which the crisis could be 
transmitted to households are: (a) exchange rate adjustment (devaluation of the local currency, consumer 
price inflation); (b) labor markets (via decreased employment and wages); (c) remittances (stemming 
from economic slowdown in source countries) and (d) government (and non-governmental) spending on 
social services such as education, health and social protection. The impact through the financial markets 
(e.g., reduced access to credit, erosion of savings and asset values) and product markets (via lower growth 
and production, relative prices changes) can also be substantial.   

25. 
Simulations of the impact of the crisis suggest that Armenia could see an increase in poverty 
rates in 2009 and 2010.  The overall poverty incidence could increase by about 5.2 percentage points 
between 2008 and 2010 (Figure 3). That means 147,000 people could fall below the poverty line in 2009 
and another 25,000 in 2010.  The projected poverty incidence in 2010 of about 28 percent is higher than 
the 2006 level of 26.5, implying that the poverty reduction recorded between 2006 and 2008 would be 
more than fully offset by poverty increases due to the crisis. The increase in the poverty gap would be 
more pronounced as the already poor become poorer. The projected poverty gap in 2010 is as large as the 
level in 2004.

The extreme poverty incidence and poverty gap could increase by a substantially larger 
margin. The levels of extreme poverty in 2009 and 2010 could easily surpass their corresponding levels 
in 2004 (Figure 4).  An estimated 149,000 people could fall below the extreme poverty threshold in 2009 
and another 31,000 would be added in 2010. The number of extreme poor in 2010 could outnumber that 
in 2004 by about 77,000 people.

Progress towards Millennium Development Goals 

27. 
Armenia has been on track to achieve most, if not all, of its Millennium Development Goals 
(MDGs) by 2015 and hopes to protect these gains from the crisis.  In 2005, the government published 
a first progress report on meeting the MDGs4; this document also sets out more ambitious goals than the 
global targets.  Rates of poverty, infant mortality and maternal mortality have fallen rapidly over the past 
few years, there is virtually full enrolment in basic schools, and the country is in the midst of education 
reforms that are increasing years of schooling and will further strengthen teachers’ salaries, training and 
curricula. However, strong efforts will be necessary in promoting gender equality, combating 
communicable diseases, and ensuring environmental sustainability.   

28. 
Armenia adopted a more ambitious goal for the first priority of the Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs) -- a reduction by half of the share of people living in extreme poverty and 
suffering from hunger by 2015.  As noted, the country has already made significant progress in 
eradicating poverty.  Using the MDG level of $4.30, poverty has fallen from 73% in 2000 to 39.2% in 
2007.  Nevertheless, it has set a target to bring this below 20 percent, which may prove difficult in the 
current global economic environment.

29. 
Armenia has similarly established national targets for the other millennium development 
goals (Table 4). Good progress has been made toward implementation of measures seeking to reduce 
child and maternal mortality rates. The under-5 mortality rate (per 1000 live born) fell from 19.3 in 
2000 to 12.3 in 2007, and the maternal mortality rate (per 100,000 live born) dropped was at 15.0 in 2007, 
compared to 52 in 2000.  The proportion of population with access to improved water and sanitation has 
also improved since 2000.  The attainment of the self-imposed and ambitious targets by 2015 will require 
unremitting effort, and some of the targets may need to be adjusted in light of the global economic 
downturn.    

G. 

Governance and Anti-Corruption 

30. 
Over the last CAS period, the authorities pursued a governance strategy that provided for 
key public sector management reforms, measures to address political and public accountability, 
and efforts to increase civil society voice and participation.  Specifically steps were taken on 
legislative changes to increase the penalties for corruption, higher public financial audit standards with 
parliamentary oversight, reforms in revenue collection and the judiciary.  There was heightened attention 
to judicial reform and improving judicial governance with a view to strengthening the independence of 
the judiciary and improving its effectiveness.   

31. 
Some steps were taken to improve the public administration system inter alia by 
restructuring central government institutions, developing a professional civil service, and reforming local 

6 Armenia continues to exceed these goals as the girl/boy ratio in primary and secondary education was 104 and 105, 
respectively, in 2007.

government.  The authorities also implemented reforms in customs and tax administrations with the aim 
of reducing the direct interaction between clients and officers, adopting rules based approach with less 
discretion for officials, and the use of risk management systems as opposed to universal examinations.  
Armenia joined the Group of Corruption Fighting Countries (GRECO) in 2004 and adopted OECD 
principles on eliminating corruption. 

32. 
However, the record is one of mixed progress.  The main advances are evident in capacity 
building in selected public institutions such as the ministry of finance, which pioneered public finance 
management changes and is among the most advanced in the CIS country grouping, the multi-sector 
public regulatory commission, and the Central Bank.  In other areas, however, changes have been to a 
degree formal, with enforcement weak or absent.  Fundamental political economy difficulties such as the 
enforcement of conflict of interest legislation on public officials, ministers and parliamentarians, checks 
to the power of powerful business interests in evading customs and tax payments, exercising de facto 
monopolies in imports and internal distribution and distorting competition conditions, remain to be 
seriously addressed.  Progress with customs and tax has been fitful and lacking in full commitment.  The 
rule of law is put under challenge. 

33. 
Various international indices confirm this mixed progress.  On the one hand, Armenia 
continues to perform reasonably well in the Doing Business indicators with a rank of 44.   However, 
Transparency International currently ranks Armenia as 109 out of 180 countries in its 2008 Corruption 
Perception Index, falling from 99 in 2007.  Surveys of public and business opinion have repeatedly shown 
tax and customs, education, and governance reform/anti-corruption policy as the three main concerns.   

34. 
The 2009 Anti-Corruption Strategy is expected to centre on conflict of interest management 
and rules of conduct for public officials.  Business processes in various areas (e.g. central government, 
tax and customs services) and improved accountability both on performance and resource management 
aspects will be other elements of the strategy.  Whilst these are important, the strategy will also need to 
pay attention to the fundamental weaknesses identified above in para 30. 

II. 

The Country ’s Development Agenda and Priorities 

A. 

The Country Development Program 

35. 
The Sustainable Development Program (SDP), approved by the government in October 2008, 
is Armenia’s second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP-2). 7  The SDP has three key goals 
covering the period 2009–2021 (with specific medium term targets indicated in 2009–2015): reducing 
poverty, including the elimination of extreme poverty; ensuring human development; and deepening 
economic growth and accelerating development of lagging regions.  

36. 
The specific quantitative targets of the SDP were rapidly overtaken by the impact of the 
global economic crisis and the medium term outlook for the economy is now radically different.  
The SDP is therefore being revised by the authorities within a participatory and consultative framework 
and a new document will be published in the autumn of 2009.  Nevertheless, the central reformist thrust 
of the SDP is expected to be re-affirmed.  Thus, the document provides valuable guidance on the medium 
term reform needs of the country. 

7 PRSP-1 met its key economic and social goals, reform measures were broadly taken as planned, and this effort was 
supported by a series of four poverty reduction support credits from IDA.   

11 

 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
37. 
The SDP puts forth a second generation economic growth and diversification strategy 
aimed at deepening competition and fostering private sector development.  It envisages greater 
fairness in economic competition which will require stronger political will as well as legal and regulatory 
measures. These include: (a) strengthening the law on competition, and improving conflict of interest 
laws and implementing them more forcefully; (b) upgrading regulatory frameworks for public-private 
partnerships; and (c) liberalizing the civil aviation sector and further improving the pro-competition 
regulatory framework in the telecommunications sector. Efforts will be made to ease administrative and 
legal barriers, including those related to weaknesses in corporate governance, for small businesses and 
firms as well as to reduce costly tax and customs administration barriers.   

38. 
The SDP explains 
that reforms 
in 
infrastructure, particularly 
transportation, 
telecommunications, and energy, within a framework of enhanced private participation, are critical 
to ensuring growth.  Road and rail links will have to be substantially upgraded to realize the potential of 
a transit country.  Moreover, recent liberalization in telecommunications and in civil aviation will have to 
be extended.  The authorities envisage renewed efforts at diversifying sources of energy and increasing 
the utilization of indigenous energy resources.    

39. 
The SDP also proposes ambitious reforms in public administration and the judiciary.  In 
public administration the SDP focuses on the following areas: (a) raising governance standards and 
efficiency in the unified revenue-raising institution through deep customs and tax administration reforms; 
(b) increasing the competitiveness of public service pay while improving performance management; (c) 
further developing and rolling out e-government systems; (d) introducing conflict of interest rules for 
public servants; and (e) strengthening public expenditure management (PEM) through development of a 
comprehensive strategy. 

40. 
In all these areas, the authorities see the development of a knowledge economy to be critical. 
Improvements in competition, backbone infrastructure and communication services, and in public 
administration will require investments in information and communication technologies (e.g., to permit e-
government services or to promote efficient information availability and innovation within the private 
sector) and the adoption of new methods of doing business. 

41. 
Over the medium-term the further development of the social sectors remains among the key 
priorities.  Further reforms of the primary health care system are needed in order to complete the 
transformation to a more efficient, family medicine-based system. The SDP focus on improving the 
quality and accessibility of preschool education is highly important, as it responds to the serious 
deterioration and increasing inequity of the preschool sector over the last ten years. In higher education, 
the political will to align Armenia with the Bologna process goals is a critical first step in reforming the 
governance and financing of the system, increasing transparency and accountability, and eventually 
improving quality.  

42. 
Finally, the SDP pays significant attention to the social protection system and lays out 
ambitious objectives on benefit levels, targeting, and moving toward middle income country 
standards. Perhaps the most significant new expenditure commitment in the SDP is the considerable real 
increase in state pensions. This reflects the objective of providing minimum income security against 
poverty in old age, and the introduction of a mandatory funded pension pillar in 2010.  

B. 

Key Economic and Social Priorities  

43. 
In view of the global economic crisis, the two strategic objectives of the authorities are to 
mitigate Armenia’s vulnerability to the current shoc ks and strengthen competitiveness for post-
crisis recovery and growth over the medium term.  Over the rest of 2009 and 2010, the economy will 

12 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
continue to be buffeted by the external shock from the contraction in global output and tight conditions in 
private financial markets.  The first challenge for the authorities is to devise and sustain policies that 
would safeguard economic stability and protect social wellbeing.  Such policies are rooted in an 
expansionary counter-cyclical fiscal stance with donors providing the requisite financing.  This task is 
currently dominating the policy agenda.   The second challenge will be to position the economy to resume 
high rates of growth when international conditions turn more benign.  For a small open economy like 
Armenia, this can be achieved only by strengthening international competitiveness.  This, in turn, 
entails protecting past structural reform achievements and completing the unfinished agenda as identified 
in the SDP.   

Addressing vulnerability 

44. 
As noted, the economy faces severe adjustment pressures from the fallout of the global 
economic crisis.  These arise from the sharp fall off in external transfers (principally remittances) and 
private capital inflows (principally foreign direct investment), the contraction in global demand for 
exports, particularly metals, and the deterioration in terms of trade.  The exposure of the economy and the 
banking system to rollover risks from external borrowing, in contrast, is small and not a source of 
concern.  Addressing these impacts over the next couple of years is critically important in order to protect 
the economic and social fabric of the country.  This requires action along three broad fronts.  

45. 
First, the authorities are implementing counter-cyclical macroeconomic policies within 
prudent limits.  The external shocks have led to a contraction in output and a consequent rise in 
unemployment and poverty.  The authorities have already taken a big step with the exchange rate 
depreciation which will help ease the external adjustment and improve export profitability.  Some 
relaxation of monetary and fiscal policy has also taken place even though the revenue and financing 
constraints are binding. The budget for 2009 is being revised to reflect the depressed revenue base, and 
commensurate changes will have to be made in expenditures consistent with the aim of limiting the fiscal 
deficit to around 6 percent of GDP. The challenge for the government is to alter the composition of public 
spending and to shift it in towards rapid infrastructure operations in rural areas and elsewhere to yield 
quick results with respect to safeguarding or creating short-term employment.   

46. 
At the same time, social protection spending also needs to be protected and targeting of 
some programs improved.  The distributional impact of the crisis is likely to be adverse, with higher 
poverty and inequality, given the sharp downturn in more labor intensive and low skilled sectors.  As 
unemployment rises and returning migrants put further pressure on the labor market, demands on the 
social protection system will grow.  The rise in nominal basic pensions by a total of 75 percent over 
2008-09 will also help to fight poverty.   

47. 
As part of countercyclical policy, the government is also easing credit constraints by public 
provision of credit through the banking system.  Support for output and employment from the private 
sector is being fostered through the provision of lines of credit to the banking system, intermediated by 
the Central Bank, for on-lending to small and medium enterprises.  Such operations will serve to bolster 
liquidity in banks, improve their balance sheet, lower their costs of funding, and thereby stimulate lending 
for commercial purposes.  The authorities continue to maintain a highly open and liberal regime for 
trade, investment and capital flows, and have avoided resorting to protectionist measures.   

48. 
Second, bolstering financial stability is a key objective.  The liquidity and solvency of the 
banking system were strong at the start of the crisis, and the authorities are intent on maintaining this 
strength.  At the same time, financial intermediation is still low.  Following the depreciation of the dram, 
it is expected that the incentives for dollarization and disintermediation would diminish, and the 
authorities are committed to a flexible monetary and exchange rate policy stance to help restore 

13 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
liquidity in the banking markets.  Liquidity will be bolstered by the addition to reserves from the 
drawings on a standby arrangement with the Fund, which could be used to address shifts in currency 
preferences in the banking system.  The Central Bank is widening its temporary liquidity support to banks 
and has broadened the range of acceptable collateral.  To address possible solvency and restructuring 
needs should pressures on the economy intensify, the Central Bank will facilitate restructuring plans, 
consider providing longer term funding or equity to banks, and, if needed, enlarge the deposit insurance 
fund.  Banking supervision will also be enhanced through robust monitoring of compliance with 
prudential norms.  To support the real sector during the crisis, broadening the reach of financial 
intermediation remains important.  At the end of 2008, the ratio of total assets to GDP was 28.1 percent 
and of this loans represented 16.9 percent of GDP.   

49. 
Third, economic and social risks have to be managed.  These cut across agricultural, irrigation, 
and the social sectors. 

• 

• 

• 

In agriculture slow productivity growth has been the main factor for below average growth rates over 
the CAS period (7% compared to 13% for overall GDP), despite steady reforms in extension services, 
provision of higher quality seeds and improved access to credit.  Persistent livestock diseases, such as 
brucellosis and African swine fever led to a decline in the livestock share in gross agricultural output.  
Poor compliance with food safety standards at processing enterprises inhibits agri-food exports.  The 
near-term reform agenda will address control of major livestock diseases, improving food safety and 
competitiveness of agri-food products, through knowledge and technology transfer as well as 
investments. 

In irrigation and drainage, the government has begun to reverse the deterioration of the system and 
established an improved policy and financial framework.  Water Users Associations now cover all 
irrigated land.  Nevertheless, revenues remain at only 42 percent of cost-recovery levels and only 70 
percent of irrigable land is irrigated. There is a need to complete priority irrigation works to minimize 
water losses and strengthen the capacity of less experienced WUAs and creating unions of WUAs, 
and this will be increasingly important if Armenia is to successfully address climate change impacts 
in the future.  

In social protection, the institutional reforms focus on sharpening the targeting of the family poverty 
benefit scheme and improving the delivery mechanism.  The recent changes in the governance 
structure of social protection should be built on to improve quality of service delivery through a 
strengthened information base and improved accountability and transparency.  This would require 
completing the development of the social protection MIS as well as completing the physical and/or 
virtual transformation of all local social protection offices into a “one-stop-shops”.   

• The authorities regard reforms in pensions to be a key element of their development strategy.  The 
institution of a multi-pillar pensions system, with a prominent role for mandatory private individual 
accounts, is seen as essential for raising savings, providing for retirement income with individual 
responsibility, and spurring the development of domestic capital markets.  The reformed pension 
system will provide the incentives for building up sophisticated ICT and backbone services – a key 
component of a knowledge-based economy.  Under rapidly changing economic and fiscal conditions, 
it will be necessary to re-examine the fiscal costs and the phased introduction of this reform.  
Moreover, such a reform spanning administrative aspects (such as the maintenance and reconciliation 
of records, the transition to the new system) as well as the investment aspects (the opening of 
individual accounts, the establishment of the central depository, capital market reforms) necessitate 
careful design work accompanied by an equally careful evaluation of implementation capacity.   

14 

 
 
 
 
 
 
• 

In health care, important reform themes are a further development of primary care and related 
financing reforms (such as the introduction of co-payments for hospital services included in the 
revised basic benefits package in order to decrease informal, out-of-pocket payments), continued 
hospital optimization inter alia to incorporate the narrow specialist care at the hospital level and 
strengthening of delivery of non-communicable disease interventions, especially at the primary care 
level.  Over the past years, rationalization of the hospital system has yielded an efficiency dividend.  
It will be necessary to exploit these achievements to obtain the resources for the next stages of reform 
given the reduced budgetary resources that will be available in 2009-2010. 

50. 
An important new agenda concerns natural disasters and climate change adaptation.  While 
Armenia is a high risk country for potential economic and human losses, with earthquakes being the 
principal risk, the country lacks a comprehensive national disaster risk management strategy and the 
institutional framework is still weak, with a duplication of responsibilities between different government 
agencies.  To counter seismic risk, enforcement of construction code/standards both at design and 
construction stages will be necessary.  The authorities would also need to consider ways of reducing 
financial exposure through catastrophic insurance facilities. The South Caucasus is also highly exposed to 
increased climate extremes, and Armenia is concerned about the impacts from recent climate variability 
as well as longer term slow-onset change impacts.   

Strengthening Competitiveness for Sustained Post-Crisis Growth 

51. 
Addressing the short-term crisis vulnerabilities needs to be accompanied by measures to 
boost competitiveness for medium-term growth.  A critical core of structural reforms, identified in 
the SDP, will be pursued over 2009-2010.  Given the fiscal difficulties, reforms will necessarily focus on 
areas that do not involve large budget outlays or which yield higher budget revenues.  There are five 
specific areas where government action can help unlock key constraints to growth. 

52. 
First, improvements in the public sector efficiency can bring significant fiscal, economic and 
governance gains.  Issues in public governance were discussed earlier and they clearly undermine 
economic efficiency.  There are five areas where public action is needed: 

• 

• 

 In tax and customs administration, the recent merger of these administrations offers the 
opportunity to design a strategic business plan with the aim of ending parallelism between the 
services and ensuring genuine data sharing, joint intelligence and risk management pooling.  Two 
fundamental principles that have guided reform over the recent past need to be pursued with greater 
vigour: (i) the need to minimize interaction between the public and officials so as to reduce 
corruption; and (ii) to shift to risk management-based operating procedures in place of excessive 
direct controls and interventions.    Moreover, early actions to address certain gaps in the tax regime, 
such as reform of taxation of fuels and tobacco to a system of VAT and excise taxes, the move away 
from presumptive taxes and limited use of the simplified tax regime would raise tax yields and 
promote neutrality. 

In public expenditure management, fragmented initiatives need to give way to moves towards an 
integrated program. Strengthening the PEM system’s basic processes suggests deepening the 
budget’s performance orientation while strengthening fiduciary accountability with a focus on 
financial control and integrity. Deepening the budget’s performance orientation will entail 
strengthening the MTEF and planning processes and consolidating the program budgeting reform. 
Strengthening fiduciary accountability and transparency would entail focusing on reporting and 
monitoring (including for non-commercial organizations), internal audit and controls, external audit, 
and parliamentary oversight.  

15 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 

• 

• 

 In civil service reform, attention will be paid to performance management, improved regulation, 
and strengthened link to pay incentives. 
 The broader public sector agenda relates to 
decentralization, regional and local government reform.   

The next phase of judicial reforms will focus on the implementation of the Judicial Code which 
introduced the use of precedent in order to provide consistency to court judgments and measures to 
improve the efficiency of court operations.  This phase of reforms is designed to improve the 
accountability of the judiciary while continuing to strengthen judicial governance institutions. 

In conflict of interest, rules and regulation for ministers, parliamentarians and the public service are 
highly fragmented, sometimes overlapping and inconsistent.  The law also is incomplete in its 
coverage and enforcement is sporadic and not rules-based.  The linkages between public and private 
business interests are often close and clearly conflictive.  Moreover, the system of asset disclosures 
has important shortcomings and is rarely effective. Implementation of assets disclosures may have 
begun in earnest, but has become ineffective.  Reforms in these areas will have to be designed with 
the realization that they need to be embedded in a larger agenda of public administration reform and 
fighting corruption.  

53. 
Second, much can be done to improve the business environment further.  Public governance 
reforms will surely help to draw in private investment.  But more needs to be done to provide a friendlier 
environment to draw in scare private investment.  These include: 

• 

• 

• 

In addressing gaps in the Doing Business issues:  While Armenia’s ranking in the Doing 
Business report series is fairly strong (44th in 2009), progress in recent years has been mixed, and 
the government has defined further improvements as a priority.  In 2008, the government prepared 
an Action Plan, which is based on the Reform Memorandum prepared with the Doing Business 
Reform Advisory (DBRA) team in December 2007 but goes beyond the initial Memorandum 
recommendations and has ambitious targets.  The Government has agreed on a specific program 
with the IFC ’s advisory services (including DBRA and FIAS) to work on improvements in starting 
a business, dealing with construction permits, paying taxes, trading across borders, and inspections 
reform.   

In reforming the regulatory and competition regimes for the knowledge and communication 
economy. This would require the creation of facilitating frameworks, inter alia, to provide for 
public-private partnership (PPP) mechanisms.  Other measures in this area could include 
facilitating measures in telecom regulations for open access and sharing of communications 
infrastructure and assisting interoperability and information use interface with e-government.  It 
will also be important to ensure that more commercially attractive spectrum is available for private 
use and radio spectrum allocation policies promote maximum contribution of the telecom sector to 
economic growth.  As current aviation policy remains restrictive, measures to ensure competition 
and fair allocation in a market-based manner of aviation rights to operate services following the 
ending of the current monopoly of a privately-owned airline will have to be developed.  

Increased access to finance, in particular for SMEs in both Yerevan and the regions, will support 
the development of a diverse and vibrant private sector that can sustain growth in the longer term.  
While SMEs and micro-enterprises account for about 42 percent of Armenia ’s GDP, SME and 
microfinance lending accounted for only 27 percent of total bank lending at the end of 2008, which 
is down from 33 percent in mid-year 2006. However, a sustained increase in the availability of 
finance will require deposit growth and Armenian banks’ access to external sources of financing 

16 

 
 
 
 
 
 
more diverse that the IFI and foreign-parent-bank sources, which currently account for most of the 
cross-border financing to Armenian banks.   

• 

In corporate governance issues relate to poor standards in securities markets and in corporate 
practices.  Basic shareholder rights are provided for by law, but weak in practice. There are no 
requirements for public disclosure of ultimate beneficial owners.  Company boards often lack 
independence from controlling owners and from management. There are no rules on full director 
independence. Reform efforts, in compliance with the OECD Principles will have to centre on the 
company registry to provide for public access to documents and shareholder list.  The legal 
framework to assure properly functioning boards should be developed.  Major weaknesses in 
corporate accounting and auditing exist.  The authorities are committed to raising standards in 
corporate financial reporting and auditing through the implementation of international standards.   

54. 
Third, the infrastructure deficit has to be addressed over time as part of a comprehensive 
strategy for the country.  In meeting the infrastructure deficit, focus will need to be placed on the 
creation of an environment for greater private sector participation and improved efficiency.  Infrastructure 
investment needs are heavy and all sources of financing, foreign and domestic, will need to be tapped 
within a liberal, market-oriented framework.  In addition, across the different sectors, there arises a need 
to develop a capacity for analysis of sector policy to ensure the best informed decisions for sector 
investments, pricing, regulations and management of assets.   

• 

• 

• 

In transport, the road network is of particular importance for a landlocked country with partly 
closed borders.  Investment and operating costs are high, and strategic interests indicate 
investments in both transit transport corridors as well as in rural or lifeline roads.  There is a need 
to develop a coherent strategy for roads based on sound asset management principles, with a 
balance between capital and recurrent expenditures and funding mechanisms that ensure the 
sustainability of ongoing and planned investments at the national and local levels as well as to 
tackle problems with road safety.  Finally, there is a need to put in place workable monitoring and 
regulatory frameworks for the recently concessioned railways to secure the efficiency and safety of 
the operations. 

In energy, the agenda is dominated by the necessity to decommission the nuclear power plant at 
the fast approaching end of its operational life and to develop a strategy for the mix of energy 
generating sources.  The country has substantial renewable energy potential, but the investment 
needs are heavy.  It is vulnerable to energy price shocks as it imports natural gas for heating and 
part of electricity generation and all of its petroleum needs.  Significant improvements can be 
made in the efficiency of energy use as part of a strategy to reduce energy vulnerability.  While 
Armenia is one of the less energy intensive economies in the region, probably due to adjustments 
relatively high and rising energy costs, potential remains for further efficiency improvements that 
would enhance Armenia's competitiveness and reduce energy vulnerability  A recent IFC survey 
of private companies showed that a majority of companies see energy efficiency as an important 
issue for their business, and on average these companies plan to increase their investments in 
energy efficiency improvements over the next three years by eight times as compared to 2006-08. 

In water and sanitation, investments and institutional reforms have resulted in much greater 
private sector engagement, particularly in water supply, with the city of Yerevan now under a lease 
operator arrangement and most of the rest of the country under private management contract. 
Despite these achievements, which have been accompanied by increases in both utility rates and 
revenue collection, revenues remain below cost-recovery levels and leakages are high because of 
the need for significant new investment.  

17 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 

In municipal solid waste management, where serious institutional and strategic deficiencies exist, 
the government intends to expand the role of the private sector in management in line with 
international best practices.   

55. 
And finally, skills development has to be central for Armenia’s vi sion of a knowledge economy.  
With the introduction of a 12-year general secondary education system, focus is shifting to the polar 
points of the education experience: (i) improving and expanding pre-school education; and (ii) reforming 
tertiary education, particularly its governance and financing mechanisms and promoting institutional and 
programme innovation.  Specifically, reforms will have to address improvements in the school readiness 
of children entering primary education in the rural area, and in the integration of the Armenian tertiary 
education into the European Higher Education Area in line with the Bologna Process.   

III. The Bank Group Partnership Strategy 

A. 

Implementation of the last CAS8 

56. 
The 2004-08 CAS was one of the first pilot results-based country assistance strategies in the 
Bank.  Its design supported the PRSP objectives and focused interventions on three areas according to the 
World Bank’s comparative advantage: (i) promoting pr ivate sector growth by improving public sector 
management, strengthening the financial sector, and reducing infrastructure bottlenecks; (ii) making 
growth more pro-poor by promoting a more dynamic rural economy, improving social assistance and the 
workings of the labor market; and (iii)  reducing non-income poverty through improvements in the 
delivery of health, education and social services.  

57. 
The CAS relied on a mix of adjustment and targeted investment credits, as well as related analytic 
work, to strengthen development effectiveness.  It also used the Armenia’s own PRSP goals in the CAS 
results matrix, thus ensuring alignment with the PRSP and national ownership, and developed 
monitorable indicators. The country team subsequently worked with the Government to develop interim 
indicators to serve as inputs to the mid-term progress report and annual CAS progress discussions with 
the government.  

58. 
The 2004-08 CAS focused mainly on IDA, given IFC’s still limited engagement in Armenia at 
the time the CAS was written.  IFC, however, significantly increased its activities during 2004-08 and 
committed about $40 million to ten different projects with six clients.  Toward the end of the CAS period, 
IFC also launched advisory work in energy efficiency finance, housing finance, and business enabling 
environment.  Due to IFC’s increased focus on Ar menia, the FY09-12 CPS is a joint strategy.   

Results achieved 

59. With respect to the first pillar – promote privat e sector led growth -- the Bank program led 
to good results. Economic growth accelerated driven by a solid macroeconomic foundation and deep 
structural reforms consolidating market economy institutions, but also helped by external factors 
(remittances, foreign direct investment).  The Bank program has contributed to the achievement of results 
primarily through the PRSC series but also though targeted operations on the judicial sector, public 
administration, transport, energy and the environment, etc.  Telecom reforms are improving the linkages 
between the country and the rest of the world. Improved institutions (laws, regulatory bodies, private 

8 See Annex II for details 

18 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
sector participation) are in place for the delivery of better public services. The work on the financial 
sector has strengthened regulation and competition, and deposits and credit have grown rapidly. The 
growth of financial intermediation has been further supported by IFC’s investments in three banks and 
one leasing company.  At end-2007, these four financial institutions reported portfolios that hold more 
than 3600 SME and microfinance loans with a total volume of $155 million.  IFC has been able to 
promote growth in the mining, tourism, and retail sectors through direct investments in enterprises in 
these sectors.  The performances of the public sector and the judiciary have improved. Nevertheless, 
technical improvements have not yet translated into improved public perceptions of service delivery in 
some areas, notably tax and customs.   

60. 
Income poverty, the key objective of the second pillar, was also reduced. The design of this 
pillar was tightly aligned to the poverty diagnosis. Emphasis on economic growth as a driver of poverty 
reduction was complemented by (a) in-depth work on agriculture and rural development where many of 
the poor lived; and (b) policies (through the PRSC) and targeted programs that supported the vulnerable.  
As a result, poverty decreased sharply, including poverty in rural areas where increases in rural 
productivity and incomes practically eliminated absolute poverty as was the original intent.   

61. With respect to the third pillar – reduction of non-income poverty -- the results foreseen 
from Bank assistance have been delivered. The public/private approach piloted and then expanded on 
water and sanitation has been innovative and has delivered results.  Key achievements in education 
include increased allocation of public resources, attention to inputs that go into quality (curriculum 
modernization, teacher training), and expansion of the general education system to a 12 year cycle. Still, 
substantive challenges remain commensurate with the objective of turning Armenia into an knowedge-
based economy able to assure access to quality education to all.  In health, larger budgetary allocations 
have contributed to achievement of results most notably in access to health service by the poor and 
availability of family trained doctors. Health expenditures, improved water supply, rising incomes and 
better health practices all contributed to a rise in the life expectancy of the population.   

62. 
The policy and technical work underlying the design and content of the reforms and interventions 
discussed under the three pillars was assisted by an ambitious range of advisory and knowledge 
products developed by the Bank, often in close partnership with country institutions.  Three are notable: 
the book, The Caucasian Tiger: Policies to Sustain Growth in Armenia (2007), which conducted an in-
depth investigation of the effects of transition reforms and developed the agenda for second generation 
reforms; a series of annual Poverty Assessments, that provided not only assessments but were an 
important vehicle for transferring skills to national institutions; and a series of programmatic Public 
Expenditure Reviews, focusing on the social sectors and on infrastructure that provided a resource base 
for policy formation.  

19 

 
 
Box 1: Lessons from the 2004-08 CAS 

• The Armenian experience shows that reform works well when there is steady commitment to reform across a 
long time period.  Moreover, the strength of the Bank ’s engagement can be traced not just to its activities 
during the CAS period but a long and deep relationship of trust built over more than a decade.    

• A key element in making the Bank ’s program effective ha s been the complementary re-enforcing package of 
annual policy support, related investments, and selected analytic work.  For example, health investments were 
combined with health policy targets in the PRSC as well as Public Expenditure analysis focusing on the health 
sector.   

• The use of programmatic instruments, focusing work in areas that the Bank has built up expertise over a long 
time period, has enabled it to provide quick and expert support.  On the policy side, each annual program has 
built on the achievements of the previous one.   

• Public/private partnerships work in Armenia.  

• Results indicators need to be chosen which are both relevant and easily measured.   Where results indicators 
relied on those measured by the government in the PRSP or the annual Poverty Assessment, they have proven 
robust and useful.   

• The vulnerability of growth continues to be a concern.  This makes policies to integrate the economy even 
more important.  

• Further progress on governance is likely to depend on clear high level commitment rather than technical fixes.  

• The shift to IBRD lending implies more strategic choices.  A likely greater emphasis on infrastructure should 
not come at the expense of capacity building and social sector investments.  It will also be important to 
strengthen collaboration across the Bank group, including IDA, IBRD, IFC and MIGA.   

• There is an opportunity to build and gradually rely more on country systems.   

B. 

Bank Group Country Partnership Program 

The Results-Based Framework 

63. 
As one of the first countries to pilot a results-based approach under the last CAS, the 
culture of results-orientation is becoming increasingly well established in Armenia.  The focus on 
results was a major feature of the last CAS and Armenia was successful with respect to the targets then 
set.  At program and project levels, incentives to deliver results have grown, and the wide dissemination 
of successful outcomes (e.g., in poverty, social service delivery, utility quality standards, quality of seeds 
supplied) has had demonstration effects.   

64. 
The CPS will deepen the results-orientation built thus far. The results framework identifies 
the outcomes to which the CPS is expected to contribute and provides measurable indicators to assess the 
achievement of each outcome (see Annex II).  Through dialogue and specific interventions, the Bank will 
endeavor to encourage amongst counterparts the measurement and evaluation of results and the creation 
of business processes, incentives and managerial behavior towards results orientation.  The move towards 
greater attention to results in the country has benefitted from the increasing rigor of results frameworks 
for recent projects and the increased capacity of country systems as supported by the Bank.   Adjustments 
to the matrix will be made at the CPS Progress Report stage to incorporate new activities planned in the 

20 

 
 
 
 
 
 
outer years of the CPS, recognizing that in most instances implementation will not progress fast enough to 
contribute to long-term development outcomes during the planning horizon of this strategy. 

65. 
Plans for monitoring and evaluation under this CPS will capitalize on opportunities for 
increased harmonization.  To this end, indicators from the SDP have been incorporated into the results 
framework where appropriate and the Bank will rely on country data systems and unified reporting 
systems where feasible.  The Bank will actively monitor implementation progress of the CPS with the 
government and key partners through regular CPS implementation reviews, and through the DPO series 
process.      

Principles of Engagement 

66. 

The proposed CPS is based upon the following principles of engagement: 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

Alignment with national strategy-- There is direct alignment with the Armenia’s Sustainable 
Development Program, taking account of the adjustments being made to reflect current 
international conditions.   

Selectivity -- The Bank Group will progressively disengage from areas where reform or investment 
needs have been substantially satisfied or where other donors have comparative advantage, or 
where the country has the knowledge and the capacity to handle for itself;  

Leveraging -- The Bank Group will increasingly rely upon leveraging other development partners 
given competing demands on IDA and IBRD resources and on the internal administrative budget;  

Flexibility.  The CPS is cast as a highly flexible strategy, given the uncertainties on the depth and 
duration of the international crisis.  While the principal objectives and strategic directions of the 
assistance strategy are unlikely to change, flexibility is necessary in the balance between pillars 
and the mix of instruments that will be most appropriate, particularly in the outer years of the CPS 
period.   

Frontloading.  The allocation of Armenia’s IDA and IB RD envelopes has been significantly 
frontloaded in the initial fiscal years of the CPS.  Therefore, the capacity of the Bank to respond to 
Armenia’s growing and complex requirements be yond 2010 will critically depend on whether 
additional lending resources are allocated to the country.   

21 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Proposed Program of Support 

67. 
In line with the results-based framework, the CPS envisages a two pillar strategy of 
addressing vulnerability and strengthening medium-term competitiveness.  It proposes a lending 
program of about five operations per year, strong implementation focus, and a rich AAA program (see 
Table 4).  Subject to the considerations of flexibility indicated above, IDA/IBRD commitments will total 
approximately $150 million per annum over FY09-10 and $120 million over FY11-12, with the front-
loading reflecting the crisis needs.  The overall IDA-15 envelope is projected at $150 million, assuming 
continued high performance with respect to the IDA performance-based allocation system.9  It is expected 
that Armenia will fully utilize the IDA-15 lending envelope.  The IBRD planned lending is $395 million 
over this four fiscal year period.  Subject to finding appropriate projects in the market, IFC intends to 
finance four or five projects per year in FY10-12, with average project size of about $10 million.  This 
would represent a significant increase over recent years; in FY08 IFC supported two projects and in 
FY09, it will support three or four.

9      Armenia has the potential for graduation from IDA by the end of the IDA-15 period, depending on continuing 
per capita performance and growth.  Therefore, no assumptions are made for FY12 as this is part of IDA16 and will 
be decided in that context.

The design of the CPS strongly reflects the context of the global economic crisis.  In FY09, 
Armenia was the first country to benefit from the IDA Fast Track Facility which permitted the use of 
expedited preparation and implementation procedures.  This permitted a frontloading of IDA resources of 
50 percent of the annual envelope in response to the crisis needs to support output and employment.  
Thus, additional financing (totaling $35 million) was rapidly provided, under emergency procedures, for 
rural road rehabilitation, community development and the rural economy, for projects with strong 
implementation performance and where designs for investments existed but could not be implemented 
because of financing limitations.  As a result, these activities started rapidly in spring 2009 and are 
expected to be completed by the end of the construction season at end-2009.  Earlier in the fiscal year, 
IDA also approved additional financing for water ($20 million).  An APL project for enhancing quality 
and relevance in education ($25 million) is also scheduled for FY09. This will support of continued 
reforms, notably the extension of the school year to the 12th grade.  Thus, IDA credits committed will 
total $80 million in FY 09.   

23 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
69. 
Given the economic uncertainties, the program laid out here has been more fully elaborated 
for FY09 and FY10.  The program details for the latter two fiscal years will be presented in the CPS 
Progress Report to be distributed to the Board within 18 months.  The scheduling of this report will 
ensure that adjustments to the country partnership strategy are timely and effective.   

70. 
This fiscal year also saw the first IBRD loan to Armenia after its attaining blend status, 
approved by the Board in February 2009, in the amount of $50 million for a domestic commercial bank 
intermediated line of credit to the small and medium enterprise sector.  This loan is part of the crisis 
response as it will bolster output, investment and employment at a time of credit drought and is expected 
to disburse rapidly.   

71. 
Over the CPS period, the series of three development policy operations will provide an 
anchor for policy and institutional reforms that cut across both pillars.  The first operation being 
presented to the Board in early FY10 will provide fiscal and balance of payments support of $50 million 
and undergird the revised budget and public expenditure choices in a recession environment as well as 
reforms in governance and competition.  The subsequent two operations are still to be defined fully, but 
will cover the critical reform priorities under each of the themes described above. 

72. 
The proposed program of new AAA follows the principles outlined above and also links 
systematically to the Bank’s ongoing portfolio and new lending.  At the beginning of fiscal 2009, the 
Bank provided the new government with a comprehensive set of policy notes covering the reform agenda 
that was being developed under the SPD.  In-depth discussions were held with the prime minister and all 
key line ministers, government agencies, and with academics and the public.  The Bank’s work continues 
to be guided by the analysis of this report.  The further AAA program supported by the CPS contains core 
diagnostic studies and ESW to design and implement the crisis response, strengthen the capacity for 
improved governance as well as provide detailed advice on the design of the next generation of reforms.  
These will be provided as formal reports, just-in-time advisory notes as well as technical assistance.   

73. 

The CPS program of support is organized along the following results-based framework. 

Strategic Objective 1:  Addressing Vulnerabilities 

Results area 1:  A post-crisis Armenia that regains macro-stability 
                           and is poised for high growth 
Outcome 1:  Macro stability maintained through appropriate external and domestic  
 fiscal adjustment    

Outcome 2:  Tax regime and administration reformed:   

Outcome 3:  Financial intermediation rises, with growth in SME credit lines to rise  
 as a share of total credit. 

74. Macro-stability and positioning for high growth.  The AAA work will be directed at providing 
rapid analysis on the evolving macro-economic stresses, particularly on fiscal adjustment and choices in 
public expenditures so as to safeguard the anti-poverty thrust of policies.  Fiscal policy advice would 
focus on both expenditure efficiency and equity gains and on strengthening the revenue base through 
improvements in tax policy and administration. Bank advice would build on Armenia’s solid track record 
of improving the efficiency and transparency of public finances.  The DPOs would be central to this 
objective.  The recently completed series of PRSCs has established a strong framework and the new DPO 
series will build upon it.  A full economic report in FY10-11 will provide comprehensive advice on post-

24 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
crisis re-attainment of rapid growth, with a shift towards tradables.  Advice on trade expansion and policy 
reform in view of the interest in a deep free trade agreement with the EU will be provided.  Key 
infrastructure support through current and new road, energy, and water projects (noted below) will also 
generate employment, support output during the downturn and help position Armenia for growth after the 
current period. 

75. 
Tax reforms.  The DPOs will be central to this objective.  The recently completed series of 
PRSCs has established a strong framework and the new DPO series will continue to have a central focus 
on this objective.  The economic report will provide the analytical framework. 

76. 
The financial sector.  A banking sector diagnostic or an update of the FSAP will be on the 
agenda for the latter period of the CPS.  The Bank will continue with policy advice to the Central Bank, in 
close coordination with the IMF, to advise on financial sector policy and institutional changes needed to 
respond to the crisis.  Bank AAA will focus on banking sector risks and vulnerabilities.  The SME line of 
credit (FY09) is strengthening the investment base for growth during the current difficult credit period 
(and may attract additional financing from other sources to extend gains in the medium term).  

77. 
IFC’s current focus on the financial sector will cont inue, as this is the best way for IFC to support 
the availability of finance to a broad number of companies.  To support its client banks during the current 
financial turmoil, IFC will provide short-term liquidity (such as trade finance) and possible support on 
recapitalization with equity or quasi-equity. During this period, SME finance and microfinance will 
remain key priorities to help ensure that small businesses still have access to capital.  IFC will also 
provide advisory services to support the management of portfolios and NPLs.  This will include work 
directly with client banks, as well as with Government to improve the necessary regulatory environment.  
IFC will also seek to support clients in the real sector with financing where prudent and is considering an 
advisory services program for SMEs on crisis management, including topics such as cost reduction and 
cash flow management, risk management, and options for companies unable to meet current debt 
obligations.   

Results area 2: Adverse poverty impact limited amidst assured health  
                          and social protection 

Outcome 1: 

Income poverty impacts are limited through employment generation from job-creating 
programs and through improved poverty targeting.  

Outcome 2:  

Increased utilization of basic health services by the poor, with a decline in out-of-pocket 
payments. 

Outcome 3: 

Urban households employ safe gas-based heating; solid waste management follows 
international good practice. 

78. 
Poverty, social protection and job creation.   The strong gains in poverty reduction are 
jeopardized by the current economic crisis, and thus generating immediate employment opportunities is 
critical.  The Bank will continue to work jointly with the authorities on increasing sophistication in 
poverty monitoring and on drawing the policy implications of the changing profile of poverty.  Clearly, 
policies to reverse rapidly the expected worsening in poverty over FY09-10 shall have high priority.    

79. 
The set of three emergency interventions in lifeline roads, community development and the rural 
economy will generate employment as well as create new sustainable capacity in infrastructure.  The IDA 
fast track operations in FY09-- The Social Investment Fund (ASIF-3) and the Rural Development Fund 

25 

 
 
 
 
 
(RESCAD) as well as the Lifeline Roads project-- were targeted for their short-term job creation 
potential.  Further additional financing for ASIF-3 is planned for FY10.  The subsequent roads projects 
over FY11-12 will create further job opportunities through direct employment as well as creating 
opportunities for improved market access and economic growth.  In FY10 additional financing for social 
assistance to support institutional changes is being planned.  The roads projects over FY11-12 will further 
assist link poor villages to markets.  The DPO will provide for changes in social protection design and 
support for the development of the multi-pillar pensions system.   The ongoing Social Projection Project 
has already put into place a well functioning safety net, but this will be augmented by further technical 
strengthening through additional financing in FY10.  Bank work under the DPOs will support the policy 
and institutional reforms to further enhance the poverty targeting of selected government programs.   

80. 
Health.  The financing of health reforms and support for the design of the multi-pillar pension 
system will be a part of the AAA agenda.  The ongoing Health APL I and II projects aim at scaling up 
family based medicine and the further optimizing hospital administration in the regions, to extend health 
care quality nation-wide.  Design of reforms to the basic benefits package, adequate costing and 
reimbursement for services will help reduce informal payments and will likely be supported through the 
DPO series.   

81. 
Heating.  The ongoing Urban Heating Project continues to provide heating services in key public 
services, including schools and hospitals.   

Results area 3: Rural and environmental risks decrease  

Outcome 1:  Irrigated acreage rises as institutions for water management develop. 

Outcome 2:  Rural output and employment is supported.   

Outcome 3:  Environmentally-safe mining code under implementation. 

Outcome 4:  Preparedness for handling natural disasters is developed. 

82. 
Irrigation.  A number of projects supporting irrigation sector and rural development (Irrigation, 
Dam Safety, and Dam Safety II) have recently closed or are closing.  These projects have been 
instrumental in restoring irrigation systems and establishing principles of participatory irrigation 
management through formation of water user associations.  A new irrigation loan in FY10 would enable 
the Bank to continue rehabilitation of irrigation systems and facilitate the next institutional step in 
creating federations of Water User Associations.   

83. 
The rural economy.  The crisis-impact work will pay close attention to the impact on the rural 
economy and to enhancing export and growth prospects.  The Bank has long been a supporter of local and 
rural development.  The IDA fast track projects discussed above support rural development.  Those 
projects have strong beneficial impacts on the rural economy not only through their short-term 
employment-generation but also through the development of community infrastructure and by connecting 
rural areas to agricultural markets.  The Social Investment Fund (ASIF-3) and the Rural Development 
Fund (RESCAD) support priority community infrastructure needs while creating immediate employment 
opportunities.  A follow-up Agriculture project in FY11-12 will enable the Bank to continue to deepen 
rural competitiveness.  Continued government investment in upgrading extension services and 
implementing food safety standards are important to ensure growth and the opening of new export 
markets.   

26 

 
 
 
 
 
84. 
Environmental risks.  The DPO is supporting the development of a mining code that pays 
particular attention to environmental aspects and during the CPS period the code will be brought under 
implementation.  Fiscal and regulatory incentives to ensuring environmental protection will be central to 
the code.  The reformed environment will ease the re-start of the mining sector after the current downturn 
and the attraction of foreign direct investment.   

85. 
Natural disasters.  The management of natural disasters, particular the use of insurance products 
and public preparedness, as well as measures to adapt to climate change will feature in the latter part of 
the CPS period.  Support in the form of policy advice and the transplantation of international best practice 
will be important in this regard.  The Bank will consider assisting the country to conduct pilot 
vulnerability assessments in the energy and agriculture sectors and to develop adaptation plans for water 
sector investments.  This work can help build in better climate resilience to Bank-supported investments 
as well as assist Armenia in adaptation planning.  There is also the possibility to use facilities not 
currently included in the lending program for disaster insurance and the environment, such as the Carbon 
Fund.   

Strategic Objective 2:  Strengthening Competitiveness for Post-Crisis Growth 

Results area 4:  Governance is strengthened; as a result, 
         public sector efficiency rises 

Outcome 1: 

Conflict of interest among public officials is substantially diminished; and fair 
competition in commerce is established. At least 60 percent of firms agree that 
implementation of laws is consistent and predictable.   

Outcome 2:    Business surveys show near-elimination of complaints of revenue agency behavior.   

Outcome 3:    Program budgeting leads to efficient expenditure allocations; and civil service 
performance appraisal is introduced.  Judicial decisions are rule-bound.  Strengthened 
accountability, transparency and efficiency in the use of public funds.   

86. 
Competition and conflict of interest.  The advisory work will cover conflict of interest policy 
within the umbrella of a coherent strategy on governance and anti-corruption reforms.  Measures are 
being designed to add to the powers and the reach of the Competition Commission and to enhance its 
technical skills.  Policy steps taken in these areas will be a part of the DPO-supported reform agenda.   

87. 
Revenue agency reforms.  Technical advice to the revenue raising agency in both the areas of 
customs and tax will be provided under the DPO.  The DPO-supported program envisages the 
implementation of the medium-term reform strategy in the agency that provides for rules-based behavior, 
the full extension of risk-based revenue management, reduced interaction between officials and the 
public, and the adoption of modern business practices to these ends.  Customs reforms will provide full 
behind-the-border support to the operation of a free trade agreement with the EU.   

88. 
Public service reforms.  The PEFA prepared by the authorities and the CFAA will be followed 
up with further analysis and technical assistance.  Loans in public sector and financial management 
(FY11-12) will finance e-infrastructure, equipment in agencies and technical assistance.  Improved 
governance has been supported through the recently completed series of PRSCs, and the ongoing Judicial 
Reform II and Public Sector Management projects.  New follow-on loans in public sector management 
and financial management (FY11-12) will finance further improvement in civil service reform, building 
modern accounting, internal controls and auditing systems, and further strengthening electronic feedback 

27 

 
 
 
 
 
on service delivery.   

Results area 5:  Foundations for knowledge economy and 
competitiveness strengthened 

Outcome 1:   

In support of a knowledge-based economy with the necessary infrastructure, strategy 
being implemented for increased internet penetration, amidst the laying of a national 
ICT broadband backbone network. 

Outcome 2:   PPP framework in operation.  Commercially valuable spectrum available for private 
sector use; and aviation fully liberalized.   

Outcome 3:  

In transport management, road network is improved and analysis and  regulatory 
capacities strengthened. 

Outcome 4:  

In energy, investment financing for new generation capacity; and transmission losses 
reduction.   

Outcome 5:  

In water, share of consumers with continuous water supply rises, cost  
recovery improves, budget support for current operations phased out by 2012.   

Outcome 6:  

 A growing private sector faces more open competition and access to finance.   

Outcome 7:  

In education, increase of net preschool (5 years old) enrollment rate.   
Increase in the share of public funding in the total revenues of public higher education 
institutions.   

89. 
Knowledge and competitiveness.  A major effort will lie in developing a comprehensive strategy 
towards a knowledge-based economy and the design of the supporting infrastructure.  An ICT/e-
governance project (FY10) will provide technical support and financing for key infrastructure.  It also will 
provide 
technical support and financing for building critical "backbone" 
telecommunications 
infrastructure, facilitate technology transfer and also augment the education projects (noted below) by 
establishing an innovation fund for higher education centers of excellence.  The DPO will supplement this 
through regulatory and competition reforms as a key theme, and reforms in governance and financing of 
universities to create the conditions and provide the incentives for their increased involvement in 
research, development and innovation.   

90. 
PPP framework.  Regulatory reforms on private sector participation in infrastructure and utility 
services, and policy reforms in telecommunications, civil aviation liberalization will be analyzed in the 
context of the lending being prepared.  The DPO will play the central role in these areas.  The Bank will 
provide advice on the management of PPPs.  Outcomes will provide for the auctioning of commercially 
valuable radio spectrum and the full liberalization of civil aviation once the existing monopolistic 
commercial agreement comes to an end in 2013.  IFC may also support the development of particular 
PPPs either through advisory or investment work.   

91. 
Transport.  Studies will cover management of transport assets and associated regulatory reforms.  
The roads sector operation (FY10) will improve quality.  IFC will seek opportunities to catalyze private 
sector participation in transport and logistics projects, facilitating improved access to markets.   

28 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
92. 
Energy.  AAA will support the authorities in the development of an energy strategy in light of the 
need to decommission the existing nuclear power plant.  The current renewable energy project and 
Geothermal GEF project are supporting the development of alternative energy sources.  New Energy 
Supply Reliability and Energy Efficiency Project (FY11-12) will enhance electricity supply reliability, 
reduce transmission losses and energy intensity of the economy, and contribute to the export of 
electricity.  A new hydro/renewable energy project (FY11-12) could be pursued and IFC is seeking 
opportunities to finance private small renewable energy projects.  IFC is completing an energy efficiency 
survey to identify opportunities and will build on this work through advisory and financing to banks to 
encourage the provision of energy efficiency financing. 

93. Water.  The Bank has been very active in building a new public-private partnership in the 
delivery of water supply to businesses and the public through two ongoing projects -- Yerevan Water and 
Municipal Water projects.  Additional Finance for the Municipal Water Project was provided in FY09 to 
help extend the management contract and set further quality benchmarks. 

94. 
Private sector. IFC has launched an advisory initiative to support improvements in the business 
enabling environment, which will decrease the costs of doing business in Armenia and increase the 
competitiveness of its private sector.  To support growth of the private sector, IFC will also provide and 
mobilize financing. In the banking sector, after the crisis-related needs for short-term liquidity and 
recapitalization have passed, IFC will resume longer term lending to facilitate access to finance to a broad 
number of private companies.  IFC will target reaching 4800 SMEs through its partner banks by FY12, 
with a total SME loan volume of at least $200million.  IFC will also remain engaged in the development 
of housing finance, a government priority, through advisory and investment services.  IFC will also 
directly finance private companies of sufficient size and transparency.  In addition to the possible PPPs, 
transport and logistics, and energy investments mentioned above, IFC will seek to make direct 
investments in sectors where Armenia has a comparative advantage, such as mining, or where the 
investment project has a positive impact on businesses in its value-chain, such as retail, warehousing or 
food production.  

95. 
Education.  Higher education reforms will focus on innovation, and on governance and financing 
aspects.  The education APL-II project (FY09) will enhance school learning by supporting the completion 
of the 12-year general education system while improving the school readiness of children entering 
primary education. The project will also help improve quality assurance in higher education institutions 
so as to support their integration into the European Higher Education Area.  It will build on the ongoing 
education APL I project and extend gains to both the pre-school and tertiary level which have largely 
depended on private fees which lock out the poor.  The project will help improve the school readiness of 
children entering the primary system.  It will also help develop the quality assurance framework.  IFC will 
support the development of student loans through its client banks.   

Use of Bank Group Instruments 

96. 
Investment operations will contribute most heavily to the Bank’s implementation program . 
Their share in total lending will likely be about 80 percent.  The bulk of the investment operations are 
likely to be in the infrastructure sectors.  IFC will invest primarily through financial intermediaries, with a 
focus on short-term liquidity and equity or quasi-equity during current financial turmoil.  IFC will also 
selectively invest directly in companies with the full range of products as appropriate.   

97. 
Development policy operations will remain the main policy-based lending instrument of the 
Bank directed at providing support for the implementation of the SDP.  While the overall share of DPOs 
will likely be about 20 percent, the cross-sectoral content of the DPOs and their leveraging of budget 
support operations from other partners, such as the ADB or the EC give them higher prominence. 

29 

 
 
Moreover, the complementarity of efforts between programmatic support under the DPOs and investment 
lending will be key to supporting reforms, institutional change and essential supporting investment and, 
hence, to making efficient use of Bank resources – as was done under the previous CAS.   

98. 
IFC intends to significantly increase its investment activities in the country. Its focus on the 
financial sector will continue, as this is the most effective way for IFC to reach a large number of smaller 
businesses in the economy.  To support its client banks during current financial turmoil, IFC will provide 
short-term liquidity (such as trade finance) and possible support on recapitalization with equity or quasi-
equity, possibly leveraging financing from the Bank Capitalization Facility and the Global Trade Facility.  
IFC is also seeking to develop instruments that would allow for the provision of local currency financing 
to Armenian banks.   

99. 
Analytic and advisory work will continue to be a core element of the program.  The Bank 
will continue as a leading external source of economic, poverty and sector analysis.  The AAA work done 
over the 2004-08 CAS period has deeply informed the CPS program now being proposed.  Work on 
macroeconomic and reform policy choices presented to the new government in mid-2008 as well as a 
programmatic series of public expenditure reviews was used to shape the government’s economic 
program across a broad swath of activities: taxation regime, raising governance standards and efficiency 
in revenue collection, public management, institutional reforms in regulation and infrastructure, and 
expenditure choices in the social sectors.  Poverty assessments have influenced the design of social 
transfers.  Technical assistance on pension schemes has been used to make strategic choices in the 
institution of a multi-pillar system.   

100. AAA will be used to illustrate policy choices that are particularly important in 
macroeconomic and anti-poverty policies, public expenditure options and core structural reforms.  
Analytical work will maintain its focus on sophisticated structural reforms and on those issues most 
critical to reducing the risks to the population posed by transition and external shocks. As noted, the 
advisory work program will be responsive to opportunities at the regional south Caucasus level and to 
global public goods.  IFC will provide advisory services related to business enabling environment, access 
to finance, energy efficiency, and possibly on PPPs for infrastructure and social services. 

101. The Bank will also build on its experience with programmatic approaches in selected 
sectors across various instruments.  For instance, Bank engagement over time in the energy sector 
would be continued with new investment projects to support transmission rehabilitation and energy 
efficiency measures, but would be informed by analytical work on an appropriate energy sector strategy 
for the country.  IFC will complement the Bank’s ro le through advisory services to banks on energy 
efficiency lending and possibly financing (either direct or through partner banks) to support renewable 
energy and energy efficiency. 

102. The Bank’s work on governance and anti-corruption will be consistent with the Bank’s 
recently approved corporate strategy.10  It will be cross-cutting in nature, with dialogue focused on the 
key, critical pre-conditions for success with an overall governance strategy that will address political 
economy factors.  It will also provide advice on selected interventions in public governance, the judiciary, 
the revenue-collection agencies, social services (addressing corruption in tertiary education as well as out 
of pocket spending in the health sector); and this technical work will be backed up by lending.  IFC will 
support transparency in the business climate through its advisory work on the business enabling 
environment and possible engagements on corporate governance issues.  As with other key reform areas, 
country ownership and leadership are critical in this area together with the coordinated roles of other 
donors.  This is the only way that the Bank’s program can make a decisive difference in the period of the 

10  See Strengthening World Bank Group Engagement on Governance and Anti-Corruption, March 2007

proposed engagement strategy and improve the country’s standing on various governance measures.  

Box 3: One Bank – IFC and IDA/IBRD Integrated Programs 
The IFC and IDA/IBRD find that joint approaches and programs in the following sectors would have a particularly 
high pay-off over the CPS period: 
• In the financial sector, the objectives of the Bank Group program are to deepen financial intermediation, raise the 
share of lending to SMEs, and ensure the continued strong health of banks.  IDA/IBRD will provide advice on 
strengthening supervision, developing contingent liquidity support schemes, providing finance to the banking 
system for on-lending to SMEs.  IFC will focus on liquidity provision through trade credits and possibly assist 
banks in re-capitalization using its new facilities as well as provide SME and micro-financing.  It will also 
provide advisory services related to NPL and risk management. This joint framework will provide comprehensive 
technical and financial assistance at a time of stress, keeping the vision of long term development always in mind.  
• In the business enabling environment, IFC and World Bank teams are jointly developing targets related to the 
business climate for an upcoming IDA DPO and will continue to work together to ensure consistent messaging 
and coordinated actions with the Government.  On issues related to revenues, IFC and the Bank will also involve 
the IMF as appropriate. 
• In energy, IDA/IBRD will assist the authorities build on their strategy to consider long-term generation and 
exports as well as renewed emphasis on renewables and efficiency.  Lending support will be directed at 
transmission improvements and developing renewables.  IFC will seek to support private companies in 
developing renewable energy, either directly or through banks, and will support the development of energy 
efficiency financing by its client banks.   
• In infrastructure and PPPs, all parts of the Bank Group will be heavily engaged in supporting this new priority.  
IDA/IBRD will focus on the regulatory framework and the infrastructure requirements of the knowledge-based 
economy.  It will finance infrastructure and e-development.  Besides its focus on the business environment, IFC 
will look to providing advice on specific PPP deals and possibly financing them.   
• In mining, IDA/IBRD is providing advice on a reform of the mining code, with focus on the fiscal and 
environmental aspects, to create a sustainable and transparent framework for activities and foreign investment.  
IFC has one mining investment in Armenia currently and if the regulatory and licensing regime improves, it may 
anticipate additional opportunities in the CPS period.   

Portfolio management and performance 

103. Total Bank exposure to Armenia amounts to the equivalent of $1.1 billion, (including three 
Global Environment Fund operations), with disbursements amounting to $1 billion.  The active portfolio11 
consists of seventeen IDA credits, one IBRD loan and two GEF projects, for a total commitment of $385 
million, of which $186 million undisbursed. The Bank Group also actively manages a portfolio of about 
35 trust fund grants. 

104. 
Portfolio performance has been highly satisfactory. The disbursement ratio12 of the portfolio -- 
a key indicator of overall portfolio performance -- was 34 percent by end-FY 2008, well above the ECA 
average of 18 percent for the same period. All investment projects are rated in the satisfactory range both 
for Implementation Progress and achievement of Development Objectives.  Over the CPS period, it is 
expected that the total number of projects in the portfolio will decline.  The 2005 Country Financial 
Accountability Assessment (CFAA) report concluded that the overall fiduciary risk is significant. The key 
reasons are: (i) inadequate capacity of core control and supervisory agencies performing the audits within 

11 Data as of March 1, 2009.  
12 Disbursements during the fiscal year as a percentage of undisbursed balances at the beginning of the fiscal year 
(investment operations only) 

31 

 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
the public sector; and (ii) although most of the basic laws are in place with respect to various entities’ 
(private sector and public enterprises, including state non-commercial organizations) financial reporting, 
compliance remains a problem and authorities need to improve the quality of auditing, reporting, 
monitoring and supervision. The PEFA assessment report published in October 2008 also demonstrates 
that several critical Public Financial Management (PFM) elements including internal controls, internal 
and external audit, and financial reporting are still weak.  

105. While the country financial management inherent risk is significant, the control risk at the 
entities level implementing Bank projects is moderate. The Bank projects financial management 
systems have been adequate to ensure that funds have been used for intended purpose. All the projects in 
the portfolio have been audited by private sector auditors acceptable to the Bank. There are no overdue 
audits regarding the projects (credits and grants) or continuing entities. Some delays have been observed 
in the past particularly regarding to audit of companies operating in the water sector. The project 
implementing agencies have satisfactory financial management arrangements in place and sound internal 
control systems. The FM staff involved in Bank projects is experienced and skilled. An issue of concern 
was the high turnover of FM staff, mainly caused by the attractive remuneration packages offered in the 
private sector.  However, recent increase in salaries and slow down in private sector recruitment indicate 
that this issues does not pose a significant risk. All projects have moderately satisfactory or higher FM 
rating. 

106. Nevertheless, continued strong attention to portfolio and enhanced implementation support 
will be required. Infrastructure investments will likely represent a higher share of portfolio, requiring 
more focused supervision to address quality issues and corruption risks. Implementation support could be 
enhanced through (i) introduction of risk-based approaches; (ii) more resources for risky projects; (iii) 
better physical verification of works; and (iv) a greater reliance on civil society organizations in 
implementation.  Results will be monitored through a series of Portfolio Performance Reviews, to be 
conducted every two years jointly with the government.  In line with the Bank’s overall strategic 
direction, it would be important to move towards the use of country systems in Armenia.  There are no 
major fiduciary risks likely to affect the implementation of the CPS programme.   

107. 
IFC has a committed portfolio of $43 million, of which $40 million is disbursed.  The portfolio 
includes seven clients, in banking leasing, tourism, mining, and retail-related infrastructure.  Portfolio 
performance overall has been satisfactory.  About two thirds of this portfolio is debt with the remainder in 
equity, quasi-equity, and a guarantee (through IFC’s global trade facility).   

Box 4: Bank Office Strengthens its Public Outreach 

In March, 2009 the WB Yerevan Office, launched its long-awaited Public Information Center, in partnership with 
the Papazian Library of the American University of Armenia (AUA). The Papazian library serves over 9,000 
regular patrons and is open for general public. The rationale behind the name "Knowledge for Development 
Center" is the belief that knowledge-sharing is essential for people ’s full participation in society and is an 
important step to support reform and development. By situating the center in a local institution, the Bank ’s role as 
a ‘knowledge bank ’ will be enhanced.    

The Knowledge for Development Center houses around 1000 Bank publications of the past five years, a 
dedicated shelf with files on each on-going and active project in Armenia, and provides access to the Bank ’s e-
resources, with full-text publications and up-to-date development indicators via a well-equipped computer corner. 

The center will go beyond one-way ‘information dissemination ’ to a more two-way communication and sharing 
of knowledge with and among users. To this end, the Center will expand its role as a hub for facilitating dialogue, 
consultations, and knowledge-sharing among the academia, media, Government, Civil Society, as well as the 
private sector.

Partnerships 

108. 
The update of the PRSP through the preparation of the Sustainable Development Program has 
served as a vehicle for strengthening the government’s role in donor coordination.  Donors are active in a 
number of key areas (as described below) and Armenia has made efforts to obtain stepped-up donor 
assistance in the light of the financing needs that arose from the international economic crisis.  In addition 
to coordination in the field, many donors including Japan, UK, Netherlands, Sweden and the EU have 
provided grant resources through Trust Funds managed through the World Bank. 

109. 
The IMF approved a standby arrangement in the amount of $540 million in March 2009 for a 
period of 28 months that is heavily front-loaded (disbursements in 2009 will amount to $350 million) to 
deal with the crisis effects.  The key elements of the program provide support for (i) a return to a flexible 
exchange rate regime; (ii) a strengthening of the financial sector to maintain stability and confidence, 
including through Central Bank liquidity support operations, as needed, and (iii) a revision of fiscal 
priorities to maintain macroeconomic stability, while protecting social outlays and public investment, in 
light of the expected revenue shortfall. This new agreement has replaced the PRGF that was approved in 
November 2008. World Bank, IMF and Government of Armenia jointly work on Armenia's short- and 
medium-term macroeconomic and fiscal projections, and Debt Sustainability Analysis. Another area of 
cooperation is tax administration and tax policy reforms. The IMF and the Bank have provided technical 
assistance to the State Revenue Committee to introduce change management system, including for 
reforming the Large Taxpayer Unit. 

110. 
The Asian Development Bank supports rural development, private sector development, and 
promotion of regional cooperation. Armenia joined ADB in 2005. The first investment lending operations 
supported rehabilitation of rural roads and rural water supply. ADB water project covers small towns and 
villages in five marzes included in AWSC service area, where the Bank-assisted project is being 
implemented. Hence, the Bank works closely with ADB to coordinate investments in the area. ADB is 
also considering financing of the North-South road transport corridor, assistance in financial reforms for 
enhancing business environment, as well as budget support in close consultation with the World Bank.  

111. 
The EBRD provides finance to SME's, primarily through credit lines to local partner banks, but 
also directly through its Direct Investment Facility, Direct Lending Facility, as well as co-financing and 
risk sharing with local banks under the Medium-Sized Co-financing Facility. To reinforce the local banks' 
capacity for meeting the private sector's financing needs, EBRD selectively pursues equity participation 
in Armenia's best banks.  It has financed three financial institutions that are also clients of IFC, one with 
equity and two with debt.  EBRD also supports creditworthy renewable energy and energy efficiency 
projects, and finances the country's leading privately-owned power generation and distribution 
companies.  It is co-financing the Bank's on-going Renewable Energy Project that supports investments 
for the development of renewable energy projects, mostly small-hydro power plants. EBRD is also 
planning to provide financing to private operators and concessionaires of public utilities and transport 
infrastructure companies. Where justified by the potential transition impact, EBRD would pursue 
sovereign-backed projects, particularly those with a significant component of grant co-financing. In 
addition, EBRD is providing financing for rehabilitation of five of Armenia's wastewater treatment 
system in Sevan region within AWSC service area. The project is implemented and supervised by the 
management operator of AWSC. The Bank coordinates with EBRD the exchange of information on 
mutual efforts in Armenia's water sector. 

112. 
The European Union is supporting the development of an increasingly close relationship 
between the EU and Armenia in the context of the European Neighborhood Policy (ENP) and the Eastern 
Partnership. Consultations have been initiated for the possible establishment of a Free Trade Agreement, 
implying an even closer alignment with the body of regulations on the EU single market. The EU’s 

33 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
assistance strategy focuses on strengthening democratic structures and good governance, on further 
support for regulatory reform and administrative capacity building and on poverty reduction. Assistance is 
provided via Twinning, TAIEX and EU Advisory Group, and through budget support grants. Budget 
support has focused on vocational education training and judicial sector reform. The EU and the Bank 
coordinate closely with regular exchange of information on judicial sector reform, as part of the Judicial 
Reform Project supported by the Bank. 

113. 
The UNDP country program for Armenia supports economic and social governance, with the aim 
of expanding and strengthening the national social monitoring system; introducing innovative income 
generation schemes; strengthening disaster risk management; and multi-sectoral responses to HIV/AIDS. 
Another area of focus is democratic governance where the UNDP program helps strengthen governing 
institutions with policy, oversight and electoral functions; promote participatory policy-making among 
targeted groups; and increase awareness of human rights. In the area of environmental governance it helps 
strengthen the conservation and sustainable use of natural resources and increase access to sustainable 
energy. There has been close cooperation between UNDP and the World Bank in supporting the 
preparation of SDP, where UNDP's assistance was in the area of facilitating participatory process and 
reflecting the voice of vulnerable groups in the poverty reduction strategy. Moreover, the Bank supports a 
program on institutional arrangements in disaster risk management financed by the Global Facility for 
Disaster Reduction and Recovery (a partnership of the WB, UNISDR and others), thus cooperating and 
sharing information with UNDP in the area of disaster risk management. The UNDP and the Bank also 
cooperate to support community-based activities to manage communal services, particularly heating. 

114. Other UN agencies support areas related to Bank activities—in environmental management; 
renewable energy development; primary and public health programs; and in preschool education. UNFPA 
supports reproductive health, while FAO assists in the areas of food safety, brucellosis control, re-
forestation, capacity building in agricultural biotechnologies and bio-safety, as well as pesticide quality 
control. UNICEF supports the development of pre-school education as well as health and nutrition, and 
child protection. Under the Education Quality and Relevance Project, UNICEF supported the 
establishment of preschool classrooms in 22 most vulnerable communities contributing to the training of 
preschool teachers. It is envisaged to further expand the existing partnership between the Bank and 
UNICEF into the agenda of the new education project and establish preschool classrooms in 150 
vulnerable communities. The WFP is continuing its food security assistance to vulnerable groups, while 
UNHCR has ongoing projects in health and vocational training. 

115. German Financial Cooperation with Armenia started in 1995.  KfW finances investments and 
consulting services in the financial sector and economic infrastructure. The Sustainable Economic 
Development Program promotes micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, the Credit Guarantee Fund 
for Armenian commercial banks, and development of a sustainable housing finance market. KfW has also 
financed energy projects, including rehabilitation of high-voltage sub-stations, hydro power plants, and 
construction of high voltage lines. The Municipal infrastructure program supports water supply and 
wastewater systems rehabilitation, housing for refugees and a management contract in water sector. KfW 
has also supported nature protection through the establishment and management of protected areas. The 
Bank built on the KfW experience in developing the SME line of credit operation. 

116. 
The Russian Federation is expected to extend a loan to Armenian in the amount of $500 million 
to help mitigate the impact of the global economic crisis.  The timing and the purposes of the loan are still 
to be settled, but it is expected that the proceeds will be used for anti-crisis needs as well as for residential 
housing spending in the northern city of Gyumri to benefit populations displaced from the 1988 
earthquake.    

34 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
117. 
The USAID program helps to improve governmental functions—especially tax and customs 
administration, social protection, the judiciary, public sector accounting, management of healthcare, and 
ensuring secure and sustained access to energy and water resources. It also helps private sector 
development by improving access to finance and capacity of small and medium sized enterprises. The 
Economic Growth program supports financial sector deepening, provision of business advisory services, 
and promotion of advanced education and technology. The Democracy and Governance program supports 
youth and community action, civic advocacy, local government, rule of law development programs, as 
well as access to information for community involvement. The Health and Social Development program 
supports primary healthcare reform, reproductive health, as well as strengthening of social protection 
systems. The Bank and USAID are cooperating in assisting the tax administration to implement risk 
based audit practices, and improve VAT refunds and taxpayer services. Close cooperation has also been 
engaged in supporting pension reform. The Bank and USAID are cooperating in providing training to 
commercial banks participating in the Access to Finance for SMEs credit line. 

118. 
The Millennium Challenge Corporation is focused on the reduction of rural poverty through a 
sustainable increase in the economic performance of the agricultural sector. The program mainly supports 
rural road rehabilitation and construction of irrigation canals. Another component of the program, the 
Water-to-Market Activity, provides training to farmers in which there is close collaboration between 
MCC and the Bank in the use of new and improved farming technologies. The Program was developed in 
close collaboration with the Bank teams working on irrigation, agriculture and transport sectors. Because 
the “good governance” criterion included in the 
compact with MCC has not been met, the roads 
component has been suspended and the program will be under quarterly review by the MCC Executive 
Board.  

IV. Managing Risks  

119. The key risks to the implementation of the CPS arise from the external environment, the 
geopolitical situation, and the political economy factors. These risks and measures to mitigate them are 
discussed below. 

• 

The global economic environment.  Economic shocks are clearly predominant today and will quite 
possibly remain so throughout the CPS period.  These could result in a further drop in the demand 
for Armenia’s exports, additional weakening in export prices, and/or a continued reduction in 
remittance and foreign investment inflows.  Developments in the Russian economy are of 
particular importance given the deep trade links, the large population of migrant workers in Russia 
as well as Russian investment in Armenia.  Armenia’s integration into the world economy has also 
rendered it vulnerable to external adverse developments, but its cautious attitude to foreign 
borrowing has lowered risks of banking capital cut-offs. 

• Regional geopolitical factors.  A further risk arises from geo-political factors: continued stand-off 
or a worsening in relations with Azerbaijan over the Nagorno Karabakh conflict and continued 
closed borders with Turkey.  Moreover, political and investment risk in the south Caucasus has 
risen as a result of the Georgia-Russia conflict of August 2008.  Conversely, a settlement of 
regional conflicts and a lessening of international tensions throughout the south Caucasus would 
reduce the perception of risk and stimulate investment.  

• Political economy factors are dominant in the second generation reform dialogue.  As discussed, 
reforms are entering a difficult and sensitive terrain in governance and competition.  The power of 
vested business interests and their influence over parliament and the government is evident in 
links between public service and businesses that raise conflict of interest concerns.  A credible and 
effective governance strategy can no longer be developed without tackling such weaknesses.  A 

35 

 
 
 
 
 
fair playing field for the private sector becomes even more important during times of economic 
volatility. 

120. The economic risks are mitigated in part by strong economic fundamentals: low debt 
(internal and external) that permit fiscal and debt space for counter-cyclical and social support policies, 
and the strong record of structural reforms that have placed the economy well to seize opportunities for 
growth as the international cycle turns.  Nevertheless, a small open economy like Armenia will be unable 
to avoid the fallout from the global economic crisis and would have to go through significant economic 
and social adjustment.   

121. The willingness of the Bank Group and the Fund as well as other partners to offer 
extraordinary financial support and employment-supporting measures is an important mitigating 
factor.  As stabilizing factors for both economic and geopolitical risks, both the EU and Russia are 
reaching out in offering balance of payments support, but also long term trade access possibilities (the 
free trade agreement with the EU and similar arrangements with the EurSec).  The CPS will also retain 
flexibility to adjust Bank lending as needed to respond to shifting needs.  Nevertheless, the extent of the 
global economic downturn and the ability of the government to mitigate its economic and social impacts 
may affect targeted CPS results and these will need to be revisited at mid-course.   

122. Attempts at resolving differences with the two neighboring states, Azerbaijan and Turkey, 
continue.  Should the situation either deteriorate or improve significantly, we would need to revisit the 
CPS framework.   

123. Domestic political tensions remain a factor.  Pressures on the current government by sections 
of the public and claims that the electoral process is flawed and voice and public participation face 
restrictions can undercut action towards addressing the more important economic development needs of 
the country.  The CPS will be implemented in a manner that widens dialogue and knowledge 
dissemination, and so works to build broad support for institutional and policy reforms.

ARMENIA 

Annex 1: CAS Completion Report: FY05-FY08 

ANNEX I 

1. 
The Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report (CASCR) provides an evaluation of Bank 
Group assistance to Armenia for FY05-FY08.  The CAS (report number 28991-AM) was discussed by 
the Board in June 2004 and was among the first set of pilot results based CASs.  Results targets were 
based on achieving the goals in Armenia’s Poverty Reduction Support Program (PRSP).  The CAS 
Progress Report (report number 38585-AM) discussed by the Board in February 2007 reported on interim 
results and also indicated where revisions of the program were needed. This Completion Report examines 
the relevance of the CAS to Armenia’s longer term goals, the achievements of CAS outcomes, and Bank 
Group performance in furthering CAS outcomes.   It draws on project completion and supervision reports, 
IEG and QAG reports, the Government’s evaluation of the PRSP, the IMF PRGF program and other 
documentation, various national and international surveys, as well as inputs from former and current 
Government officials, other stakeholders in Armenia, and the Bank country team.    

Background 

I. Relevance of the CAS 

2. 
From 1995 to 2000, Armenia staged an impressive and sustained economic recovery. Soon after 
independence (1991), Armenia like all other FSU countries, went through a severe economic contraction, 
accentuated by the aftermath of a major earthquake and the conflict with Azerbaijan. After the cease-fire 
(1994), the authorities introduced a comprehensive package of first generation economic reforms that 
focused on (a) achieving a sound macroeconomic environment, (b) relying on the private sector to carry 
out productive economic activities and (c) improving the capacity of the state in the provision of basic 
public services. A process of economic recovery and transformation ensued. 

3. 
From 2000 to 2004 Armenia completed most first generation reforms and began several second 
generation reforms, within a continuing sound macroeconomic framework. The authorities prioritized the 
consolidation of fiscal accounts, the elimination of budget arrears and the reduction of quasi-fiscal deficits 
through realignments of utility tariffs and increased collection rates. In addition, in an effort to improve 
performance and sustainability, the government began to involve the private sector in the delivery of 
public services. Concurrently, reforms were launched in a wide range of areas covering (a) justice, (b) 
finance, (c) taxation and public expenditures, (d) competition and regulation and (e) social services and 
assistance.   By 2004 Armenia had had been growing by about 10 percent per year on average and had 
reached and surpassed the level of income per capita at independence.   Armenia also posted the highest 
policy (CPIA) rating of all IDA countries.   

4. 
Nevertheless important challenges remained in the 2005-08 period, with respect to full 
implementation of second generation reforms, governance and poverty reduction.   First, while growth 
was high, it was concentrated in a few sectors which made it vulnerable to shocks13 .  This underlined the 
importance of improving the business environment and reducing barriers to entry of new firms and 

13  The 2004 IEG Country Assessment Evaluation rated the Bank ’s assistance as satisfactory and its contribution to 
institutional development as substantial but underlined that “high growth rates may be difficult to sustain: growth 
has been focused in a few capital intensive sectors and not yet supported by large-scale entry of new firms. ” 

37 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
businesses.  Second, high growth rates had yet to translate into significant poverty reduction.   Poverty 
remained at 49% in 2002, especially in rural areas and secondary cities, and a gini coefficient of .45 
signaled high inequality.  This underlined the need to diversify sources of growth, strengthen the social 
safety net, improve budget allocations to the social sectors and improve the delivery of services.  Third, 
the modest pace of modernization, accountability and transparency of state institutions had the potential 
to constrain economic growth, poverty alleviation, and economic diversification.  Specific concerns 
included the low level of revenue mobilization and a lack of judicial independence.    

The Government Strategy: 2003 PRSP 
5. 
The Government engaged in an intensive consultative process that resulted in setting a series of 
national goals in its first Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), issued in October 2003.  The PRSP 
focused on the challenges of (i) reducing poverty and inequality, and (ii) improving human development.  
To achieve these, the PRSP emphasized private-sector-led growth and macroeconomic stability and 
committed to strengthen the core functions of the state, including those contributing to poverty reduction. 
The Joint Staff Assessment (JSA) of the IMF and the Bank endorsed this analysis and noted the 
participatory process supporting its design. The JSA stressed the importance of monitoring and 
evaluation, prioritization of interventions and linking the PRSP to the Medium-term expenditure 
framework and annual budgets.  

The 2005-08 CAS Design  

6. 
The CAS design supported the PRSP objectives and focused interventions in three areas where 
the World Bank considered it had a comparative advantage: (i) promoting private sector growth by 
improving public sector management, strengthening the financial sector, and reducing infrastructure 
bottlenecks; (ii) making growth more pro-poor by promoting a more dynamic rural economy, improving 
social assistance and the workings of the labor market; and (iii)  reducing non-income poverty through the 
delivery of better health, education and other basic services.  

7. 
Besides supporting the PRSP, the CAS design addressed the recommendations identified by 
IEG’s March 2004 Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE). The CAE found that Bank assistance over the 
previous 10 years had been well used and achieved substantial impact, but also recommended that the 
Bank focus more forcefully on improving the business climate and public sector management.  
Management agreed with these recommendations and incorporated them into the CAS.  The economic 
growth agenda emphasized the removal of infrastructure bottlenecks with an emphasis on improving 
competitiveness through reducing the costs of linking the country to external markets, creating a strong 
financial sector, and increasing the capacity of the authorities to develop and implement policy.  
8. 
The CAS relied on a mix of adjustment and targeted investment loans, supported by related 
analytic work.   This was consistent with the CAE finding that the mutually supportive investment and 
adjustment operations had helped increase development effectiveness.  At the beginning of the CAS, 
fourteen investment projects were under implementation.  None of them would be cancelled or 
reprogrammed during the life of the CAS. These projects, jointly with the PRSC series, were intended to 
contribute the bulk of results targeted under CAS.  In some areas (rural development, water, education, 
health, social assistance) the agendas and roadmaps were already quite developed based on the on-going 
projects and the analytical work.  In other areas, the PRSC served as the basis for policy dialogue with 
government.   The CAS set out both a base and indicated that with continued policy improvements and 
growth, a high case would be possible, as would the potential to move from IDA to blend status (both of 
which have occurred).  

Identified Risks 

38 

 
 
 
 
9. 
The CAS identified four possible sources of risk. First, the CAS saw political change in the 
Caucasus Region as a downside risk in case of conflict and an upside potential should relations with 
neighbors be normalized.   While neither was considered very likely, it was appropriate to include this 
geopolitical issue.  Second, the CAS indicated that reform momentum could slow as the political 
consensus in Armenia became more complex, and correctly put an emphasis on active knowledge 
dissemination and involvement of civil society. Third, several economic risks such as lower remittances, 
or higher prices of energy could destabilize the economy.  The CAS Progress Report elaborated further on 
the emerging economic risk associated with high exchange rate appreciation.  While these economic risks 
did not undermine growth during the CAS period, the current global crisis underscores Armenia’s 
vulnerability to such shocks.  Fourth, the CAS recognized that Armenia was vulnerable to unexpected 
natural resource shocks (earthquakes, major drought, floods, landslides, or frost.  Although there were no 
major natural disasters during the CAS period, there was a need to add to assistance program an operation 
to address an unexpected Avian Influenza threat.  

Overall Assessment of CAS Relevance  

10. 
The CASCR rates the relevance of the CAS design and the identification of risks to be 
Satisfactory. The CAS built on both the PRSP and the CAE in its design. The CAS notably used PRSP 
goals for which there was high government ownership in the results matrix, thus ensuring alignment with 
national objectives and uses a range of monitorable indicators. The approach also used a proven mix of 
adjustment and investment operations in a mutually supportive manner to achieve these goals.  It is 
noteworthy that virtually all of the operations in the CAS high case were implemented as envisaged with 
only minor modifications, and the majority of strategic objectives were achieved.  Risks were also 
correctly identified and although none emerged in such a manner as to undermine achievement of CAS 
objectives, they were – and continue to be – among th e main development risk factors for Armenia.     

Long Term Development Outcomes  

II. Results Assessment 

11. 
Overall, the rate of economic growth exceeded expectations. Economic growth accelerated to an 
average of 13 percent per annum between 2003 and 2007, while the target in the PRSP and CAS was 6 
percent.  Rapid growth was fueled by a favorable external environment that generated increasing 
remittances and capital; but also sound economic policies including keeping inflationary pressures 
moderate. Investment as a share of GDP jumped to 34.8 percent in 2007 from 24.3 percent in 2003; the 
increase was financed with savings, which rose from 17.5 to 28.6 percent of GDP. External debt was also 
kept low.  As an independent corroboration of these results, in July 2008 Fitch raised Armenia’s rating to 
BB, similar at that time to other Middle Income Countries.  On the downside, Armenia export 
performance and rural sector development continued to lag behind overall growth.   

12. 
The decline in poverty incidence and inequality also exceeded expectations.  The PRSP and the 
CAS had projected a substantial fall in poverty from a base-line of 49 percent in 2002 to 41 percent by 
2006.  In fact, poverty fell even sharper than anticipated, reaching 34 percent in 2005, 26.5% in 2006 and 
further declined to 25% in 2007.  Just as impressive, the percent of extreme poor fell from the PRSP 
target of 15% to below 4%.  Also, income inequality narrowed as the Gini coefficient dropped from 0.45 
in 2002 to .37 in 2006 and 2007.  These results have been spurred by a strong rise in remittances, real 
wages, and social transfers.  Unemployment appears to have fallen, though the statistics are unreliable.  In 
addition, low labor force participation rate (56 percent) possibly masks significant underemployment.  
There are also many who are clustered just above the poverty line, underlining their vulnerability to an 

39 

 
 
 
 
 
economic downturn.  While poverty has declined significantly throughout Armenia, it remains higher 
outside of Yerevan, particularly in the secondary towns. 

13. 
Human development indicators have improved.  The PRSP targeted a substantial increase in 
social expenditures, and this was exceeded in absolute terms (although the target of raising social 
spending to 10.8% of GDP was not met, given the rapid GDP increase).  As a result of this increase as 
well as institutional improvements, prospects to meet the MDG targets have all improved: While the CAS 
indicated that most MDGs would likely be met, prospects in the health area were considered unclear or 
unlikely.  According to the demographic handbook of Armenia, infant mortality (per 1000 live births) fell 
from 15.6 in 2000 to 10.9 in 2007. Reforms have continued in general secondary education, including 
increased teacher salaries, refurbished curricula, and the addition of a 12th grade.  Nevertheless, access to 
pre-school education, which is the responsibility of local governments, remains low and fees in higher 
education are relatively high. The contribution of social assistance expenditures to reducing poverty has 
been significant.  

14. 
The quality of economic governance has improved but has done so unevenly. Armenia remains 
the country with the highest policy (CPIA) rating across IDA countries.  The shift from public to private 
sector continued and with a strengthened regulatory regime in both the financial sector and utilities.  
Technical improvements were made in the budget and revenue areas.  Nevertheless, a significant 
unfinished agenda remains. While Armenia continues to rank relatively well in Doing Business (#44 in 
2009 DB), these ratings have remained roughly stagnant during the CAS period, and point to more work 
needed particularly in customs and taxation.    Considerable work is needed in strengthening public 
transparency and accountability, building a more level and transparent corporate playing field, with 
strengthened corporate financial reporting framework and moving towards a higher level on 
innovation/technology   The WBI “Governance Ma tters” framework indicates improvements in 
regulatory oversight but stable on rule of law.  The WBI ratings on Voice and Corruption have worsened.  
Nevertheless, in comparison to other CIS countries, Armenia remains a leader using the WBI 
methodology, coming first in regulatory quality, and second in control of corruption and in the rule of 
law.  

Overview of Results Delivered by the CAS program  

15. 
The CAS program has three pillars: (i) promoting private sector led growth, (ii) making growth 
more pro-poor, and (iii) reducing non-income poverty.   This CAS Completion Report finds that the 
results were satisfactory for all three pillars, with particularly strong results for the second and third ones.    

Pillar I:  Promote private sector led growth 

16. Within Pillar I, the CAS focused on four specific areas: (i) weak public sector services; (ii) an 
underdeveloped financial sector; (iii) unreliable and costly telecommunications and transportation; and 
(iv) the need for improved natural resource management. The 2002 BEEPS indicates that while Armenia 
outperformed ECA averages on many indicators, they were lower on telecommunications, electricity, 
finance and transportation. Entrepreneurs perceived the financial sector, tax administration, and 
uncertainty in regulatory policies as constraints. Hence the priorities selected by the CAS, particularly on 
public services, telecommunications, transportation and finance, were relevant.   

17. 
The operational instruments to deliver the assistance included the Programmatic Reform Support 
Credit (PRSC) series, complementary investment operations and analytic work. The analytical work 
provided under the 2005 CEM (which was later published as a book: The Caucasian Tiger), focused on 
reform sustainability and competition policy, and has played a vital role in providing rigorous analysis 
and designing the reforms.  This was then followed up by a programmatic public expenditure review 

40 

 
 
 
 
series and just-in-time notes. The PRSCs covered finance, taxation, public expenditure, transportation, 
regulation, tariff policy, etc. Complementary investment operations focused on modernizing public 
administration and the judiciary.    

A:  Improving Public Sector Services, Governance, and Judicial Sector 

18. 
The CAS highlights that performance of the state agencies was limiting private economic activity 
due to obsolete public administrative practices, lagging mobilization of public resources, and limited 
transparency in using these expenditures. In addition, the judiciary was seen as lacking independence and 
having poor administrative practices that introduced uncertainty in the rule of law and property rights. 
This chapter is organized around two sub-themes: (a) improving the capacity of the public sector; and (b) 
enhancing the judiciary.  The CAS results matrix makes primary use of two surveys carried out under our 
projects – the Administrative and Regulatory Costs Survey (ARCS) and the Enforcement Survey prepared 
by the Ministry of Justice (ESD).  These are then checked against various international surveys including 
the Bank’s CPIA rating, EBRD transition index, cr edit rating agencies, BEEPS, Doing Business (DB), the 
WBI Composite Index, and the Judicial Reform Index (JRI) by the American Bar Association

19. 
Although the evidence is mixed, on balance the performance of the public sector has improved. 
Better macroeconomic management is reflected in improved national and international ratings (prior to 
the current global economic crisis) including ratings from the Bank, EBRD, and Fitch. Advances in the 
delivery of public services (health, education, social assistance, telecommunications, electricity, water and 

41 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
transportation), as will be reported later, point to a greater capacity of the state to deliver results. Public 
officials are better remunerated and merit is increasingly the criterion for hiring and promotion.  The 
budget is comprehensive and has become more aligned with the PRSP and national objectives. At the 
same time, improvement in taxes and customs has been more tentative and recent, and these remain areas 
of concern.  Work on reducing corruption and the use of political power for economic benefit has also 
been lagging. The participation of the population in public decision making is limited.  Recent measures 
(ARCS, DB, WBI) provide mixed evidence and BEEPS08 is not yet available to gauge impact. 

20. 
The resources available to the public sector have increased rapidly.  Rapid income growth and a 
modest increase in the ratio of taxes collected to GDP from 14.0 percent in 2003 to 16.1 in 2007 provided 
the government with enough resources to dispel concerns about the state being unable to supply basic 
services. Still, the playing field is not yet level for businesses in paying government revenues and the 
limited buoyancy of tax collection (the IMF estimates the yield could be up to 6 points higher with better 
administration), remains a concern.   

21. 
The Government is moving to reduce the cost of compliance with tax and customs legislation but 
the results are not yet clear. With the PRSC and analytic support from the Bank, IMF and other donors, 
Armenia is working on improving tax and customs practices, which BEEPS and Doing Business surveys 
have identified as major constraints to doing businesses.  Preliminary efforts to overhaul tax and customs 
administrations have centered on facilitating compliance with the tax law, the establishment of a Large 
Taxpayers Unit (LTU), reducing opportunities for corruption through piloting self-declarations in 
customs, and establishing a higher threshold for VAT registration.  However, as these technical 
improvements have largely come towards the end of the CAS, surveys have not yet corroborated whether 
they have led to improved perceptions towards tax and customs.  The 2009 Doing Business report which 
ranked Armenia’s business environment 44th over all, still places taxation in Armenia at 150th place.  

22. 
Progress in public expenditure management has improved the alignment of budgetary allocations 
with national priorities.  To better align the budget to the national objectives, the Government, with Bank 
and IMF support, brought budget classification and public sector accounting and reporting standards in 
line with GFS classification and chart of account; in addition, it rigorously follows a rolling Medium 
Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and is piloting program budgeting, which is ready for broader 
implementation. As a result, today Armenia has a more clearly articulated budget process which lends 
discipline in determining funding priorities.  In addition, budget monitoring and control systems are in 
place and will be strengthened with the implementation of a new Law on Internal Audit has been 
submitted to parliament for approval, and is in line best international practices. Oversight (financial 
reporting and supervision) over state non-commercial enterprises has tightened to mitigate risks, which 
loomed large at the beginning of the CAS and remain substantial. With Bank support, the government has 
completed a Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) analysis in 2008.   The PEFA 
confirms progress in budget transparency and accounting and establishes benchmarks to gauge progress 
in the future.  

23. 
Civil Service Reform: The size of the Government has shrunk, though there may be room for 
further pull backs.  At the same time, the government has increased salaries, which still are below private 
sector counterparts. A new Public Service Law will help to strengthen the merit basis for appointments, 
and the Government is introducing a performance management system.  The Bank’s Public Sector 
Modernization Project is helping the Government to improve and track the application of merit principles 
in Civil Service Management; to ensure equal opportunity in procurement contracts; and to improve local 
government services.  Work is on-going in all of these areas, but full results will come at project 
completion in 2010.  

24. 
Local governments have a stronger fiscal base. Local governments now manage all land and 
property tax databases and receive all the revenues collected.  At the same time, local governments have 

42 

 
 
greater responsibilities, for example in the area of basic education, and it is not clear whether funds are 
yet adequate for their service responsibilities.  The Bank has been supporting decentralization through the 
Public Sector Management Project and the Social Investment Fund which is helping to build the capacity 
of communities and local governments. The CAS proposed to measure increases in the capacity of local 
government and perception of local service quality through surveys undertaken under the PSM project, 
but these questions were regrettably discontinued. 

25. 
Technical efforts to fighting corruption seem to lack traction.   In 2006 the government completed 
implementation of a 2003 Anti-corruption strategy, which focused on greater transparency in government 
(dissemination of budgetary information, aggressive use of web portals to provide information, 
information of legal rights, etc.).  At the same time, public perception is of limited progress — Armenia 
has remained at roughly the same low level in Transparency International’s Corruption Index from 2004 
to 2008; the World Competitiveness Survey (2008) ranks corruption as a major constraint on business. 
And the WBI governance indicators show a worsening of public perception in this area.  Preparation of a 
new anti-corruption strategy is underway and expected to focus on conflict of interest management.  
While important, the effectiveness of any such strategy would benefit from a close look at the symptoms 
of corruption rather than only on technical issues.  The 2008 BEEPS may throw light on which specific 
aspects of corruption are of concern.

Instruments: Judicial Sector Reform Project (JRP) I and II 

26. 
The Bank support for the judiciary has produced some tangible results.   According to the 2002 
BEEPS, only between 25% and 35% of firms using the courts found services affordable, quick, and able 
to enforce fair decisions. To assist in the development of an independent, accessible and efficient 
judiciary in FY01 the Bank approved a Judicial Sector Reform Project. The ICR for this project rated the 
results as satisfactory; but IEG, downgraded the rating to moderately satisfactory because infrastructure 
rehabilitation absorbed most resources and, in their opinion, de-emphasized broader institution building.  
With hindsight, however, the project did make a major contribution to the design of the 2006 
Constitutional amendments and the drafting of the new Judicial Code, both of which set the institutional 
basis for a more independent Judiciary. The Code introduces practices that should facilitate prompt and 
fair judicial rulings. To support deeper reform of the judiciary, the Bank approved a second Judicial 

43 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sector Reform Project. What has been done thus far under JRP II combined with JRP I has produced the 
following results:    

• A modern electronic case management system has been piloted and rolled out to all courthouses; 
• Development of a comprehensive legal information system (ARLIS) launched in 2005 now contains 
about 37,500 laws and averages half a million pages visited per month;  
Improved recording of court proceedings through the use of audio technology;   
• Widespread information diffusion of rights and judicial procedures; 
• A court design that reduces opportunities for private interface between the judges and parties.  

• 

27. 
Available indicators show that the Judiciary has improved. A Survey under JRP I found that, 
between 2000 and 2006, satisfaction of court users increased across a variety of services (courts, 
enforcement, prosecutor, police and legal support.)  At the same time, even the performance of the courts 
and legal support which ranked the highest, are still relatively low at slightly over 4 on a 10 point scale. 
The ARCS Survey also found an improvement from 2004 to 2007 in whether the judiciary was an 
obstacle for business. The Enforcement Survey under the Ministry of Justice (EDS) also shows a slight 
improvement in the share of judicial decisions enforced.   At the same time, ABA’s JRI index of Judicial 
oversight and administrative practices remained unchanged as “neutral” from 
2004 to 2008 The 2008 
BEEPS (not yet issued) and a follow-up survey under the second JRP will update the measurement of 
progress.

Instruments: PRSC series, 2005 FSAP, Financial Sector TA, IFC lending and advisory services 

28. 
The financial sector loomed as a major constraint to growth in the CAS: the 2002 BEEPS 
reported that around 50 percent of the respondents found access to finance and the quality of financial 
services a constraint to growth. Weak corporate governance, poor mechanisms to enforce secured 
transactions, including a difficult debt recovery process, and lacking financial services such as credit 
bureaus and mortgages were additional concerns.  
29. 
The quality of financial sector institutions has improved and several key concerns present at the 
beginning of the CAS have been addressed. First, building on the recommendations of the 2005 FSAP and 
the PRSC, a unified supervisory regime for the financial sector, including banking and non-banking 
institutions, under the authority of the Central Bank, is now in place and has contributed to a tighter 
enforcement of Basle principles. Second, legislative changes have strengthened creditor rights, improved 
civil procedures for debt recovery, and simplified procedures for certification of property sales and 
registration of secured credit. Third, these legislative changes jointly with a new facility for registering 
pledges of movable property in the central cadastre registry provide an adequate legal framework for most 
secure transactions in Armenia.  The IFC made important contributions during this period by adding two 

44 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
more banks to its pre-existing portfolio that included only one bank and a leasing company.  At the end of 
2007, these four financial institutions supported by the IFC reported portfolios including more than 3,600 
SME and microfinance loans with a total volume of about $155 million.  IFC has also provided advisory 
services on mortgage lending and corporate governance for banks. 

30. 
Better institutions contributed to a deeper and more stable banking sector.  Domestic credit 
expanded faster than GDP---the ratio of bank loans to GDP ratio rose from 5.68 percent in 2003 to 13.58 
percent in 2007.  Banking corporate practices have improved, consolidation has reduced the number of 
banks and foreign bank entry has increased competitive pressure. Despite their growth, banks are 
currently well capitalized and supervised, and this has enabled them to fare better than many other 
developing country banks in the current global financial crisis. 

31. 
Today the financial sector is sturdier, although it still is dominated by banking. Access to and 
cost of financing remain larger issues in Armenia than the ECA or CIS average (2005 BEEPS.)  A recent 
analysis of interest rate spreads suggests the need for further bank efforts to improve operating efficiency.  
The share of investment activity which is intermediated through the banking system is also still 
comparatively low, in part related to significant direct investment activity by the Armenian Diaspora.  
Lastly, expansion of the non-banking financial agenda is tied to improvements in the corporate 
governance of the real sector and gains in the informal economy, both areas where rapid improvements 
are needed.

N/A  

32. 
The CAS found the situation in telecommunications to be the “largest comparative disadvantage” 
for Armenia; a long-term monopoly was in place, tariffs were high and the quality of the service poor. 
The PRSC provided a platform for policy dialogue on opening up the telecommunication sector that was 
fed by the findings of the 2005 CEM (which evolved into the publication The Caucasian Tiger) and 
several just-in-time policy notes. This dialogue, combined with a negotiated end of the exclusivity period 
for ArmenTel, which had been established at the time of privatization, has resulted in the telecom sector 
opening to competition. The 2005 BEEPS reported improvements in electricity and telecommunications 
over 2002, but this will need to be verified against the BEEPS 2008 (not yet issued). The gains in 
transportation while positive were less significant. 

33. 
A framework for the regulation of utilities is in place and the private sector is engaged in service 
delivery for all utilities. The Public Services Regulatory Commission (PSRC) was consolidated as the 

45 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
umbrella regulatory agency for telecommunications, energy, railways, and water.  The Bank was in fact 
the main player through both its adjustment operations and its infrastructure investments in getting the 
PSRC to be a reasonably well functioning multi-sector regulatory body.  

34. 
Telecommunications has undergone a substantial transformation. 
 A poorly structured 
privatization occurred in 1998 which granted a 15 year monopoly to ArmenTel. With policy advice from 
the Bank, this was partly re-negotiated in 2004-05 and a new telecommunications law passed, but it is 
only beginning in 2007-08 that Armenia has been able to set out a full plan for modernization of its 
telecommunications sector. The positive results achieved include (a) an increase in the number of mobile 
service operators’ licenses from 1 in 2004 to 3 now ; (b) more than doubling of the number of mobile 
telephone service subscribers within the last two years; and (c) 30 private operators have received licenses 
for the operation of internet services, including high-speed broadband services.  Nevertheless, the 
modernization agenda in telecommunications is major and needs to be addressed rapidly to avoid 
constraining the country’s economic growth prospects; key issues include:  (a) the government ownership 
of some economically valuable spectrum and the institutional framework for spectrum management, (b) 
limited range of telecommunication services outside of the Yerevan area, (c) telecommunication services’ 
quality, and (d) sub-optimal development of the national IT industry, an area in which Armenia could 
have a significant comparative advantage. 

35. 
In addition to telecom reform, the Bank supported the development of Information Technology 
(IT) as a key driver of development.   Currently IT is about a $100 million business, significant in 
Armenia’s small economy.  An Enterprise Incuba tor LIL (closed in FY07) piloted innovative private-
public mechanisms that are providing (a) services to nascent industries and (b) continuous education and 
training to professionals in the field of information technology (IT). The project exceeded the key 
quantitative indicators and IEG confirmed a satisfactory rating on outcomes and Bank performance.  An 
Export Facility LIL (jointly implemented with MIGA) helped create the Armenian Development Agency 
(ADA), ranked by MIGA’s 2006 Investment Agencies Pr omotion Review as one of the most effective 
investment promotion agencies, has attracted several IT companies and is helping Armenia move up the 
technology ladder. 

36. 
As part of an effort to enhance connectivity, the Bank also supported introducing competition in 
aviation.  The CAS did not originally include a focus on aviation, but this issue was subsequently 
emphasized in both the PRSC and analytic work as critical, particularly given Armenia’s closed borders 
with two of its neighbors.  The government has announced a policy of expanding participation in 
international aviation services to raise efficiency and reduce costs. Implementing the policy is 
cumbersome given that exclusive rights were issued to the local airline company. Still, despite this 
handicap, an open skies aviation agreement with the United States was signed and a liberalized aviation 
agreement was negotiated with the EU.   

37. 
Progress in roads and railways has helped interconnectivity, but much remains to be 
accomplished.  An existing Transport Project at the start of the CAS period was concluded successfully in 
FY05 and rehabilitated 227 km of roads, 11 bridges, and 72 km of railway track.  New legislation was 
supported under the PRSC providing for the corporatization of railways.  During this CAS period, the 
Bank provided PPIAF assistance to develop a framework for a railway concession, which was completed 
in June 2008.  Nevertheless, to ensure railway service quality the government needs to establish an 
effective oversight of the operator.   When Armenia became eligible for MCC financing, the Bank made 
the results of its 2005 rural infrastructure study available and helped Armenia design a program in 
transport and irrigation for MCC financing, and shifted out of new financing of these sectors 
(subsequently, the Bank re-entered rural roads in mid-FY09, complementing MCC activities, because of 
the need to provide rapid employment generation as a crisis response).

38. Work on environment centered on three challenges: (a) to reverse deterioration of forested areas, 
(b) to remove risks posed by an aging dam infrastructure, and (c) to use renewable resources to meet the 
growing demand for energy. Progress has been made on all three fronts.  

39. 
A new institutional framework in place is helping rationalize logging. The preparation and 
approval of a Forest Code, with PRSC support, provides the legal basis for combating uncontrolled and 
illegal logging. An autonomous State Forest Monitoring Center has been established to help implement 
the code and monitor illegal logging, though this was done at the end of the CAS period and it is too soon 
to judge its effectiveness.  In addition, the ongoing Natural Resource Management Project (FY02) has 
helped adopt sustainable Forest Management Plans covering over 128,000 ha---more than one third of the 
forest area in the country, when no Forest Management Plans existed at the beginning of the CAS. After 
some initial delay, the latest project ISR seems to confirm that the introduction of appropriate watershed 
practices is now track.   As to the impact at the national level, the percentage of the population using solid 
fuels decreased from 57.8 percent in 2003 to 25.6% in 2007. 

40. 
Armenia is expanding the use of renewable energy sources. Today electricity generation capacity 
is sufficient to meet demand; but aging assets and growing demands indicate the need for new capacity. 
Armenia has an estimated 740 MWs of small hydro, wind and geothermal energy potential. The 
Renewable Energy Project is supporting development of privately owned and operated renewable energy 
(FY06, including GEF grant).  As of mid-2008, 60 operating licenses have been issued to small hydro 
power plants contributing 270 GWh.  However, attractive tariffs for renewable energy are needed to 
further development of renewable resources.   The Bank has financed an energy efficiency study in 2008 
which identifies economically viable opportunities in this area, and IFC has in parallel prepared an energy 
efficiency survey to identify impediments and facilitate business opportunities though its private bank 
partners.  Already, the energy intensity of use has dropped from 97.7 kg oil equivalent per 1,000 PPP 
GDP in 2003 to 70.4 in 2007 

41. 
However, concerns loom on enforcement and the larger environment agenda. Armenia has an 
Environment Action Plan (updated in 2008), but civil society have raised concerns on issues such as 
compliance with Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) regulations and the climate change agenda.  
Further work is needed to help revise the agenda forward and address some the broader concerns that 
have been raised.  

47 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Rating of the First Pillar: Satisfactory. 

42. 
The CASCR rates outcomes under the first pillar as satisfactory. Economic growth accelerated 
driven in part by external stimuli (remittances, etc.), but also a solid macro foundation and timely 
removal of key public sector constraints.  The Bank program has contributed to the achievement of results 
primarily through the PRSC series but also though targeted operations on the judicial sector, public 
administration, transport, energy and the environment.  Telecom reforms are beginning to improve 
linkages between the country and the rest of the world. Improved institutions (laws, regulatory bodies, 
private sector participation) are in place for the delivery of better public services. The work on the 
financial sector has strengthened regulation and competition, and the banking system has become 
stronger and well capitalized. The performance of the public sector and of the judicial sector have 
improved. Nevertheless, technical improvements have not yet translated into improved performance or 
public perceptions of service delivery in some areas, notably tax and customs, and broader governance 
concerns in both the public and private sector remain. 

Pillar II: Make growth more pro-poor 

43. 
The CAS supported the following PRSP objective: “a larger share of the population benefits from 
economic growth and the vulnerable are more adequately protected.” The assistance was organized 
around the concept of shared growth with attention to agriculture and rural development, reducing the 
informal economy and improving the effectiveness of social transfers. The Bank agenda benefited from a 
robust program under implementation (on rural development, social assistance) and solid analytic work.  
A cornerstone of the Bank’s analytic work in this area has been the Programmatic Poverty Assessment, 
which has become owned by the Government which publishes it annually on web as a “Social Snapshot”.  
The significant achievements under this pillar deliver on the dual objective to reduce poverty and spread 
widely the benefits of growth.

44. 
More people benefitted from economic growth as the sharp drop in poverty incidence indicates.  
The Bank has worked very closely with the Government to prepare and analyze annual Household 
Surveys and poverty reports.   In 2007, 25 percent of households were classified as poor, down from 49.3 
percent in 2002. In Yerevan the drop in poverty was dramatic—to 
21% in 2006. The rapid rate of 
economic growth that generated incomes nationwide has been the main driver behind the reduction in 

48 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
poverty, supported by rising remittances and a well targeted family benefit program. Inequality is also on 
the decrease---in 2006 and 2007 the Gini coefficient is reported at .37 down from .45 in 2002.   

45. 
The relative size of the informal economy is shrinking.  Government statistics put the size of the 
informal economy at 35 percent of the formal economy, lower than 45 percent at the beginning of the 
CAS. Given the range of estimates of the size of the informal economy, it is likely that the government 
estimate lies at the lower end; therefore, it is prudent to be vigilant and continue implementing policies 
that foster formalization of economic activity, such as reducing costs of complying with tax rules and 
regulation overall. Implementation of these policies serves as well to improve the access to financial 
services by small companies.   

46. 
Analytic work has begun on how 
to address unemployment and underemployment.  
Unemployment appears to be declining (though statistics are unreliable) but underemployment remains a 
concern: a low percentage of labor force participation, excess labor in agriculture and informal activity 
mask underemployed resources. Labor flexibility does not appear to be a major issue as the reforms under 
the 2004  Labor Code (2004) place Armenia 6th in ECA in labor market flexibility (2009 Doing Business.) 
To better understand the underlying issues Government and the Bank jointly undertook a Labor Market 
Dynamics Study (FY07) to assess the capacity of employment services and provide recommendations on 
improving the labor market.  Findings were used to draft a National Employment Strategy. Recent 
surveys show improved satisfaction among users of employment services, but further efforts are needed 
to better match education, training and job opportunities.

Strategic focus on rural development was highly relevant to poverty reduction.  In the early 
1990s, people migrated to rural areas in search of ways for coping with the economic difficulties; this 
migration pressured productivity and incomes and put a sizeable portion of the rural population at risk of 
poverty. Early on the Bank initiated support for agriculture through a series of self-standing operations 
focused on property rights, irrigation, infrastructure, technology, and credit. The FY05-08 CAS continued 
to build on this agenda.    

48. 
Poverty in rural areas has decreased; absolute poverty has been practically eliminated.  Rural 
poverty fell sharply from 48.2 percent in 1999 to 23.2 in 2006 but slightly worsened to 25.5% in 2007. 
During the same period, the percentage of the very poor in the rural areas dropped from 14.1 percent to 

49 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.3 percent.  Poverty declined even in areas of difficult access: poverty amongst those living above 1,700 
meters fell from 53.7 percent in 1999 to 27.1 percent in 2007. 

49. 
Increases in agricultural productivity and incomes helped reduced poverty.  After 2001, growth 
in agriculture picked up along with the overall the economy; between 2001 and 2006 agriculture grew at 
7.6% p.a. on average driven by productivity gains, which jointly with improved terms of trade, helped 
raise rural incomes. Still, the fact that agriculture has grown at rates lower than the overall economy (7% 
compared to 13% for overall GDP) suggests the scope for further improvements. In addition, employment 
in rural areas has remained relatively stagnant suggesting that the sector still holds an important labor 
reserve.    

50. 
Increases in productivity in the rural areas are the result of sustained efforts to ease the key 
constraints to production and investment.    

 Property rights. Early efforts (completed before this CAS) registered and titled land in rural areas.  
A Title Registration Project closed FY05 helped survey 2.5 million properties and put in place a 
reliable registration system that is foundation of a working land and credit market. Outcomes 
include: (a) significant reduction in the time it takes to register a transaction; (b) significant 
increase in real estate transactions; (c) increase in the level of mortgages; (d) better property 
rights infrastructure.   These achievements have been maintained. 

 

Irrigation. The attention of the authorities has centered on; (a) introducing participatory irrigation 
management practices; and (b) returning a larger amount of land to irrigation. Water User 
Associations (WUAs) - cover all irrigated land in Armenia and there is anecdotal evidence of 
crop yield improving. The on-going challenge is to make WUAs sustainable and continue the 
reform process by establishing Federations of Water Users Associations. The area under 
irrigation has returned to132, 000 hectares after dropping down to 112,000 (from over 200,000 
hectares in Soviet times). The current arrangements of transferring managing responsibility for 
irrigation water supply services to WUAs has resulted in major savings in energy and increased 
economic self-sufficiency (the cost recovery rate is at around 42 percent, it was 8% in 2000).  
About 80 percent of farmers are satisfied with the current arrangements. Two Dam Safety 
projects and an Irrigation Development project (FY99, FY02 and FY05) have supported 
implementation of this agenda during this CAS period. They also contributed to reduce risks for 
around half a million persons living in the vicinity of the dams.  

 Technology. The refurbishing of the research and transfer of technology institutions, a key pivot 
for increasing productivity to rural areas, had progressed with the creation of ten regional and one 
national agency, financed from grants and fees. The Bank’s Agricultural Reform Support Project 
(closed at the end of FY05) and the follow-up Agricultural Reform and the Rural Development 
Project (FY05) has supported this agenda through improving farming services, agro-processing, 
bank lending in rural areas and channeling grants in support of innovative projects. In addition, 
under the PRSC, the government has introduced OECD certification procedures to reduce the 
need for seed imports.  

51. 
The interventions in agriculture illustrate that harmonized and properly sequenced operations 
(property rights, technology, irrigation, finance, and infrastructure), with the support of good 
macroeconomic policy, can be very effective in helping raise income in the rural sectors. Most notable 
has been the early emphasis on property rights, prior to the CAS, which set the stage for achieving CAS 
targets; the certainty of property rights has had important spillovers such as active real estate markets, 
mortgages, creation of water user associations, etc.

52. 
A well targeted and easy to access system of social assistance contributed further to reduce 
poverty. Although Armenia started working on the reform of its social assistance early-on, the CAS 
document expressed concerns about its ability to target the poor and contribute to poverty reduction. 
Therefore the CAS emphasized consolidating previous efforts to deliver a well-targeted, easy to access 
and effective system of social assistance built around two main components: pensions and family benefits 
(FB). The Bank provided its assistance through the FY04 Social Protection project and the PRSC series.  

53. 
More funds for social security and a smaller population of poor households facilitated targeting.  
Pension, family benefits and other social assistance programs received 4.8 percent of GDP in 2007, up 
from 3.2 percent in 2005 (and representing a significant increase in absolute terms, given the very high 
GDP growth rate).  This created favorable conditions for a more effective social security system. 
Pensions, capturing 66 percent of social protection funds, although not targeted, are still slightly 
concentrated on the poor. The Family Benefit (FB) is highly targeted on the poor as intended: 76.7% of 
the FB resources go to persons in the lower two quintiles and 77.3% of the recipients are in the lower two 
quintiles.  All benefits combined as percentage of the poverty line went from 52.3 percent in 2004 to 78.5 
percent in 2006.  The rate of satisfaction of the beneficiaries with the system (access, timelines, etc,) as 
measured under the Social Protection Project is higher.    

54. 
Additional successful efforts have been made to reach the poor. The Social Investment Funds 
series has financed demand-driven small investments in basic infrastructure and has supported community 
development. SIF-2, completed in 2006, financed investments in clean drinking water and schools. Short-
term employment and income increased in the targeted communities. The team rated outcomes as 
satisfactory, but IEG founded them moderately satisfactory out of concern about the adequacy of baseline 
and monitoring data.  A follow-up Social Investment Fund-III (FY06) has prioritized collecting the 
information to evaluate effectiveness ex-ante and ex-post. 

55. 
Additional resources and better targeting have made social transfers more effective in helping to 
reduce poverty. Household survey information shows that social security expenditure is helping reduce 
poverty. The 2008 Public Expenditure Review estimates that, in the absence of social transfers, poverty 
would have risen from 26.5 to 32.8 percent in 2006. The incidence among the very poor would have 
almost tripled from 4.1 to 12.2 percent.  Pensions have had the greatest impact.  In 2008, nominal 
pensions increased by 62 percent, placing them above 20% of the average wage, meeting the CAS target.   

Rating of Pillar II:  Satisfactory.  

56. 
The CASCR rates as Satisfactory the results achieved under this pillar. The design of the pillar 
was tightly aligned to the poverty diagnosis, supported by a Programmatic Poverty Assessment. Emphasis 

51 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
on economic growth as a driver of poverty reduction was complemented by (a) in-depth work on 
agriculture and rural development where many of the poor lived; and (b) policies (through the PRSC) 
and targeted programs that supported the vulnerable.  While there were other factors at work besides 
Bank supported interventions (such as increased remittances), Bank efforts made a clear contribution to 
the analysis and the sharp decline in poverty.  Notably, poverty in rural areas also declined with 
increases in rural productivity and incomes (though many people remain clustered just above the poverty 
line and so are vulnerable to fall back below it during economic downturns).    

Pillar III: Reduce Non-Income Poverty   

57. 
The CAS addressed three non-income constraints to increasing the welfare of the population, 
especially of the poor: (i) poor quality of education: obsolete curriculum, high inefficiency, and 
inadequate budgetary allocations; (ii) unaffordable health care: low and poorly targeted public 
expenditures, with high out-of-pocket payments particularly affecting the poor; and (iii) low investment in 
infrastructure particularly in water and sanitation.  The supporting program relied on both existing and 
new projects covering education, health and water supply, complemented by the PRSC series. Analytical 
work on health and education was done as part of the multi-year programmatic PER program.  The 2008 
just-in-time policy options notes prepared for the new government also covered health and education 
challenges.

58. 
After independence, the quality and coverage of education deteriorated as resources shrank and 
curricula and teaching practices turned obsolete. Early on (1995) the Bank supported government in 
rebuilding the quality of education, but despite gradual progress, the perception of the CAS was of an 
education system still far from meeting the needs of the country. Limited resources, inefficiencies (high 
teacher/pupil ratios), obsolete curricula, and lack of adequate teacher training were the main concerns. 
Bank support to meet these challenges came through an Education Quality and Relevance APL (FY03) 
and the PRSC. The main focus of these interventions was on general secondary education, whose reform 
had commenced with the introduction of the Per Capita Financing (PCF) and school autonomy. 

59. 
Real resources available for education are increasing as a result of a greater share in a rising 
public budget. The share of the total budget going to education increased from 13.2% in 2004 to 15.53% 
in 2007 and its share in GDP reached an estimated 3% of GDP in 2007, when it was 2.2% in 1997. Still, 
the public allocation to education remains relatively low even if private contributions (1.9 percent of 
GDP) are added up.  The government allocated most of the additional resources to improve access and 

52 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
quality in general secondary education (grades 1-10) according to the national priorities. The availability 
of resources has made it possible to increase the average annual salary of teachers, which in 2003 stood at 
43% of GDP per capita and is expected to reach 100 percent of GDP in 2008—latest information 85% in 
2006.  

60. 
Efforts to improve the efficiency of the education system have centered on adjusting general 
secondary education to the declining population. The introduction of per capita financing as a pilot in 
1999 helped rationalize education expenditure and address the risk of an over dimensioned educational 
system---since 2001 the average number of students in general secondary education declined by 20 
percent. The optimization program developed and implemented during this CAS helped increase the pupil 
teacher ratio from 11 in 2003 to an estimated 14.5 in 2008 through an aggressive teacher reduction and re-
training program, which the Bank supported.   

61. 
Access to general secondary education has improved and is equitable. Until recently the general 
secondary education system in Armenia consisted of eight years of compulsory basic education and two 
years of upper secondary education. General secondary education is being expanded from 10 to 12 
years—of which 9 will be basic and mandatory. Enro
llment between 7 and 15 years of age ranges from 
95 and 100 percent, according to the Survey of Living Standards. The net enrollment rate (NER) for basic 
secondary education is 89 percent compared to 114 percent for gross enrollment. The GER for upper 
secondary education in 2005 was 89 percent, while the NER was 70 percent. It follows then that access to 
general secondary education is equitable—to illustra
te 42 percent of the enrollments correspond to 40 
percent of the poorest households. Percentages are higher if vocational education is included. Gender is 
not an issue in education. 

62. 
The Bank has supported government’ s efforts to set the foundation of higher quality education.  
These efforts have included (a) a new National Curriculum and Syllabi, including training over 8000 
teachers in the new curriculum, (b) the unified university entrance examination and school based 
assessment; (c) the Computer Revolving Fund for information and communication technologies; and (d) 
an ambitious in-service teacher training program. Progress on all these fronts is on time. The results from 
the TIMMS 2007 examinations, when available, will set benchmarks from which to track impact. 

63. 
Looking forward, Armenia continues to face major challenges to putting in place a globally 
competitive labor force. There have been substantial improvements in the efficiency and quality of 
secondary education, the primary focus of policy. With these accomplishments in place, the country can 
now shift attention to other development gaps. First, a significant gap in pre-school education, a 
responsibility of local governments, affects the school readiness of the first graders and disadvantages the 
poor. A second gap occurs at the level of Tertiary education. Public financing is low--.2 percent of GDP 
or around 8 to 9 percent of education spending. Tuition fees in public universities account for 30 to 40 
percent of per-capita income. The reliance on tuition fees makes the financing of tertiary education 
volatile and, as in the case of per-school education, biases access against the poor.

64. 
In health the CAS supported (a) provision of affordable quality services and (b) increasing the 
utilization of these services by the poor. By 2004, the primary health care (PHC) system was already in 
place and guaranteeing all citizens a minimum, rather broad, package of services. Limited financing for 
the PHC package led to the emergence of unofficial payments, which limited the access of the poor to 
health services. In addition, a large hospital network absorbed resources that could have gone to finance 
primary health care.  

65. 
The Health Systems Modernization Project (FY04) and the PRSC series also delivered Bank 
support to optimize the hospital sector, aiming at reducing excess infrastructure capacity and improving 
quality and efficiency of selected hospital networks.  Following an initial pilot for hospitals in Yerevan, 
the Government has initiated the hospital optimization program in the regions.   

66. 
The public budget allocation to health has increased in real terms and as percentage of GDP. 
The overall budget resources for health doubled between 2003 and 2006, even if the health sector 
allocation as a proportion of GDP increased only marginally from 1.2% in 2002 to 1.5 % in 2007. The 
incremental resources have gone to finance PHC as the PRSP intended.  In addition, the strategy to 
consolidate hospitals and the number of contracts signed by the State Health Agency dropped from 125 in 
2004 to 115 in 2006, still 15 above the target set in the PRSC. As contract simplification moves to the 
MARZ (regional) level the expectation is that the PRSC targets will be met by 2009.  

67. 
The consistent Government policy to strengthen PHC services has yielded significant results. 
First, between 1999 and 2006, the gap between the richest and the poorest quintiles in using essential 
health services shrank. The utilization of basic health services (PHC) by the poorest quintile of population 
increased from 21.5% in 2003 to 27.7% in 2007.  Second, the share of the population covered by newly 
trained family doctors and community nurses reached 58% in January 2008 when it was only 19% in 
2003. Third, utilization rates increased 33% for outpatient services and 22% for hospitals. Measured 
differently, utilization of PHC services increased from 1 outpatient visit per person per year to 2.8. 
Fourth, the percentage of the population satisfied with quality of outpatient services has increased and 
access to PHC is better spread geographically, although access in rural areas lags national averages. Fifth, 

54 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
it is estimated by the National Health Performance Report (a Bank supported initiative) that increased 
public financing has been accompanied by a reduction in private out of pocket expenditure.  

68. 
The increase in life expectancy, the reported decrease in child mortality (between 2000 and 2005 
according to health surveys) and the nearly universal access mothers have to doctor and hospital care 
point to steady health improvements.  At the same time, statistics collected through the health system 
reported in 2006 an increase in child and maternal mortality.  Authorities responded quickly targeting 
expenditures to forestall threats to child and maternal mortality. While the rapid public response is 
welcome, an accurate appreciation of trends will come only with a new health survey, as health statistics 
fluctuate from year to year.  In fact, while year-year health statistics fluctuate, under five child mortality 
fell to 12.3 (per 1000 live births) and maternal mortality to just 15 (per 100,000 live births) with both 
being the lowest level recorded. 

69. 
Armenia is now in a position to make major gains in the delivery of health services. First, the 
sector has shown it can absorb resources effectively. The effectiveness of the increased allocations can be 
monitored for access, quality and impact; the Bank project has put this monitoring infrastructure in place.  
Second, the government can lower the out-of-pocket expenditures and make the Basic Benefit Package by 
(a) streamlining benefits, (b) continuing the reform of the hospital system to liberate funds to finance 
basic health services, (c) assigning more funds from the budget, and (d) normalizing out-of-pocket 
payment as copayments for services not included in the basic package.

70. 
During the 1990s, a lack of investment resources and weak administrative practices led to a 
deterioration of the coverage and quality of water supply. The Government viewed the main problem as 
the management of the available water resources. Hence, Bank support began with the Municipal 
Development Project (FY02-06), which introduced an example of a performance-based management 
contract for the capital city, and the services of an international water operator were engaged to improve 
the functioning of the Yerevan Water and Sewage Company (YWSC) through hands-on training for the 
technical, financial, and management staff. The project financed emergency investments in Yerevan and 
helped develop a regulatory framework. This resulted in improved water management, increased financial 
viability of the utility and improved water supply and quality in Yerevan. The management contract 
worked well setting the basis for a follow-on lease contract. The legal framework for private sector 
participation is in place and working. IEG confirmed the satisfactory rating for the outcome of the project. 

55 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
71. 
The CAS helped the Government consolidate this public/private partnership through the Yerevan 
Water and Sanitation (FY05), which financed investments under a new lease contract between the 
Government of Armenia (represented by SCWE) and a private operator. The positive results of the 
combined efforts under the two consecutive projects in Yerevan include moving from seven hours of 
water availability to an average of 19.5 hours a day and increasing the percentage of the population with 
24 hours access over 70% in Yerevan today.  In addition, the focus of the Municipal Water and 
Wastewater Project (FY04) is on improving water and wastewater services outside the capital city, 
covering 45% of the population. Under the project, the Government recruited an international water 
operator to manage Armenia Water Supply Company (AWSC) under a management contract.  While the 
lease came to an end in FY09, it was renewed with Additional Financed Bank support thus further 
improving sustainability of the overall water supply system. Important results include increasing drinking 
water availability from 6 hours in 2004 to 12 hours in 2008. SIF-II and SIF III also financed water supply 
investments in small communities.   Nationally, the percentage of population with sustainable access to 
improved water source went from 87.6 percent in 2000 to 94.1 percent in 2007 (as recorded by the 
National Statistics Agency).  

72. 
Armenia has succeeded in attracting private operators to work in water sector utilizing a gradual 
approach that began with a simple management contract to address the critical situation of Yerevan. The 
positive results attained set a basis for longer contracts and are sustaining an approach to delivery of water 
and sanitation services that has been difficult to implement in other transition and developing countries.   

73. 
In addition to supporting water and sewage sector, during this CAS the Bank is supporting 
provision of safe, clean and affordable heating to the residents of the multi-apartment buildings, and the 
urban schools. The Urban Heating Project (FY06) is targeting support to multi-apartment buildings and 
schools. The results (up to 2007) include: (a) 46 percent of households in multi-apartment buildings use 
safe and clean gas-based heating solutions in 2006-2007 season compared to 11% in 2003-2004; (b) 97 
urban school’s heating systems rehabilitated in 20 06-2008; and (c) Renewable Resources and Energy 
Efficiency Fund providing capital grants to the urban poor for installation of gas heaters and connection to 
the gas network.  

Rating of Pillar III:  Satisfactory 

74. 
The CASCR rates as satisfactory outcomes under pillar III. The results foreseen from Bank 
assistance have been delivered. The public/private approach piloted and then expanded on water and 
sanitation has been innovative, has worked and has delivered results.  Key achievements in education 
include increased allocation of public resources, attention to inputs that go into quality (curriculum 
modernization, teacher training), and expansion of mandatory education to a 12 year cycle. Still, 
substantive challenges remain commensurate with the objective of turning Armenia into an ideas 
economy able to assure access to quality education to all.  In health, larger budgetary allocations have 
contributed to achievement of results most notably in access to health service by the poor and availability 
of family trained doctors. Health expenditures, improved water supply, rising incomes and better health 
practices all contributed to a rise in the life expectancy of the population.  The achievements in water 
supply, and the contribution of the Bank in this effort through supporting a public-private partnership, 
are particularly noteworthy.   

III.  World Bank Group Performance 

75. 
Overall, the Bank has delivered the CAS program on time, with high quality, and with strong 
ownership by the Government.  The Bank has leveraged limited budget resources available for a small 
economy to prepare complementary policy and investment operations, and targeted analytical work that 
has helped the Government to strategically consider policy options.  Areas for further strengthening 

56 

 
 
 
 
include a greater focus on governance and more outreach to civil society in developing programs and 
disseminating analytic work.   

Lending  

76. 
The high quality of supervision and implementation on ongoing projects has contributed to a 
timely achievement of results.  From 2005 to 2008, only one project was temporarily in problem status 
and this was addressed (the Public Sector Modernization Project had a moderately unsatisfactory rating 
from December 2007 to August 2008).  Second, a 2005 review found that project accounting and quality 
control practices were satisfactory. Third, the disbursement ratio has averaged over 30 percent per annum 
during FY05-08, among the best performances of Bank clients.  

77. 
The delivery of new operations followed the original program closely, but was also implemented 
with flexibility to changing circumstances. Most operations proposed in the CAS have been delivered, 
either during the CAS or shortly thereafter, with the main exception of an Infrastructure Project proposed 
for FY08, given the strong involvement of MCC in transportation and Irrigation with Bank support 
(subsequently three small-scale infrastructure projects were delivered in FY09).  As the CAS Progress 
Report (CPR) indicated, flexibility was shown in including an operation to address the emerging risk of 
Avian Influenza in FY07.  The CPR further proposed new lending in three ongoing areas where there was 
strong implementation and additional funds were needed to carry progress to the next stage: (a) Judicial 
reform II; (b) Heath Systems APL II, and (c) Additional Irrigation.  A new area proposed in the CPR for 
action in FY08 – Traffic Management – was ultimatel y not prepared as the Government decided to 
proceed in this through other channels.  In FY08, Armenia was declared creditworthy to begin IBRD 
borrowing in addition to IDA, although it did not do so until FY09. 

78. 
The PRSC series has been particularly effective in guiding the overall policy dialogue, 
complementing several related investment operations.  The PRSC series (four operations, corresponding 
to the high case of the CAS) concentrated on the themes the CAS had identified as a priority, mainly: (a) 
improving the environment for private sector growth; (b) improving public sector financial management 
and (c) addressing social sector issues. An ample body of solid analytical work supported the PRSC 
dialogue and the selection of benchmarks. The PRSC framework (a) complemented the work of projects 
in advancing sector reform agendas (such as environment, health, education, and social assistance), and 
(b) facilitated both the dialogue and technical assistance in areas not covered under projects (such as 
taxation and customs reform, aviation policy, and the financial sector). 

Analytical Work  

79. 
The pace and quality of analytic work has been maintained and followed the CAS guidelines.  
Most of the analytic work anticipated in the CAS was delivered (see CASCR Annex 2).  A substantive 
body of the analytical work was prepared to support the PRSC dialogue, notably the Country Economic 
Memorandum that covered competitive challenges and whose content has been widely disseminated in 
book form (e.g. The Caucasian Tiger: Sustaining Economic Growth in Armenia).  The Caucasian Tiger 
has indeed become a case study in how to develop second generation reforms in a post-Soviet economy in 
transition.  Annual programmatic public expenditure reviews have reviewed infrastructure, education, 
health and social assistance expenditure issues. It is noteworthy that in anticipation of the new 
Governments need for policy briefings to maintain policy continuity, the Bank prepared a just-in-time 
broad series of policy notes (for example, on tax, customs, public expenditures, education policy, 
aviation, pensions etc).   Also of note, two analytic pieces – the Poverty Assessment and the Public 
Expenditure and Financial Assessment (PEFA) – were bo th prepared by the Government with the support 
of the Bank (rather than the other way around) thus ensuring strong ownership.   

57 

 
 
 
80. 
A 2006 QAG review rated the Bank analytic work as between satisfactory and highly satisfactory.  
The QAG review of Armenia’s FY02-FY05 AAA focuse d on 14 out of 22 tasks, which absorbed 90 
percent of the total resources.  QAG rated the execution of the analytic program satisfactory, but called it 
borderline highly satisfactory. QAG found analytic work “to be an essential in gredient of Armenia’s 
success story, with notably impact on the Government’s decision-making on policy reforms, consensus 
building on reform and design and implementation of programs (especially the PRSCs) underpinning the 
country’s good economic performance and its significa nt progress towards reducing quality.”  At the 
same time, QAG called for a broader degree of dissemination, including planning at inception.  

Monitoring and Evaluation 

81. 
Monitoring and evaluation proceeded at both the project level and the country level.  At the 
country level, this was facilitated through periodic Country Portfolio Reviews (CPRs), the last of which 
took place in 2007 and was results oriented.    The following 2008 Country Portfolio Review was merged 
with the preparation of this CASCR. In addition, the CMU tracked on a continuous basis the milestones 
set under the CAS; this tracking informed the drafting of the CPR and the preparation of the CASCR.  
Monitoring was facilitated as PRSP indicators were used where appropriate, and the Government 
prepared a comprehensive review of results under PRSP-1 in September 2008.  

82. 
A CAS Progress Report (CPR), presented to the Board February 2007, maintained the results 
expected under the CAS and slightly revised the lending portfolio and the AAA agenda in ways that have 
been noted already. The CPR presented preliminary lessons and recommendations that the CASCR 
incorporates.  

Working with Government 

83. 
The previous CASCR highlighted the strong relationship the Bank has with the Government at all 
levels, and in particular the positive role that the local office has played in the dialogue with the 
authorities. The QAG review made the same point and this CASCR ratifies the finding. The local staff 
combines experience with recurrent training, and several have gone on to positions in the Government or 
private sector. Greater supervision responsibility has also been assigned to the local staff and this has 
contributed to a well performing portfolio and positive policy dialogue in all sectors.  

84. 
The interface with the Government is also supported by effective Project Implementation Units 
(PIU). Initially PIUs were self-standing administrative bodies, but have changed their legal status several 
times and most are now more integrated with line Ministries than before and also have oversight Boards 
(including the line Ministry, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Justice).  A few have the status 
of a Fund (Armenia Social Investment Fund and Renewable Energy Fund) but these also have developed 
a strong interface with the Government and are overseen by Boards (for example, the Chairman of the 
Board for both Funds is the Prime Minister).  

85. 
The effectiveness of these PIUs and their experience in the management of Bank projects 
(procurement, FM, disbursements etc.) have contributed to the satisfactory status of projects and high 
disbursement rates in Armenia.  They have also become effective support units (including on policy 
matters) for their respective Ministries who at times call on them for work outside of Bank operations, 
taking into account their professionalism and performance.  While both the Government and the Bank 
agree that the ultimate goal would be to fully integrate project management into Ministries using their 
own structure and staff (in line with the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness), this would need to be 
done carefully going forward so as not to reduce the strong expertise developed over many years. 

Coordination with Other Partners 

58 

 
 
 
 
 
86. 
Coordination with the IMF has been effective and complementary. The IMF supported the 2003 
PRSP through a three year PRGF approved in May 2005, after the previous PRGF expired in December 
2004. Besides maintaining macroeconomic stability and prudent monetary and fiscal policies, the 2005 
PRGF operation focused on buttressing the financial sector as well as public revenues.  This in turn has 
enabled the government to finance social and growth expenditures.  The two institutions have 
collaborated closely in these areas and financed complementary technical assistance (for example on tax 
administration reforms).  The 2005 FSAP roadmap has been implemented with the support of the two 
institutions.  

87. 
Coordination with other donors in Armenia has been good, emerging mostly from individual 
efforts but within the overall framework of the PRSP and MTF set by the Government.   Examples of 
harmonization include: the work on water where the development partners’ support is covering most of 
the country; there has been close work with MCC in irrigation and in the allocation of competitive grants 
to farmers, likewise with UNICEF in pre-school education; while co-financing arrangements with 
bilateral donors (Dutch and Swedish) have supported reforms in the Judicial system; export promotion, 
and forest management.   The PSMP project provides a framework for coordinating technical assistance 
to the Government on public sector issues.  

Management of Risks 

88. 
The risks identified were realistic and though they did not materialize over the CAS period, more 
recently vulnerability to external economic shocks has emerged.  Internal political tension and change 
during the CAS period did not cloud economic performance or perspectives, as it was feared it might 
happen. The country did not experience major natural shocks. Regional political conflict (mostly related 
to Nagorno-Karabakh) neither intensified nor weakened and any long lasting impact on Armenia of the 
recent Georgia developments is uncertain. Lastly, the external environment was more beneficial than it 
had been expected.  With hindsight, it was providential that the CAS focused on improving the financial 
sector which has proven resilient thus far in the current global economic crisis, but more attention to 
building public savings and to diversifying exports could have helped them further in the current 
situation. 

Rating Bank Performance:   Satisfactory 

89. 
The CASCR rates Bank performance as satisfactory.  Overall, the CAS was well-aligned with the 
priorities of government and showed selectivity in its interventions.   It aligned the annual adjustment 
operation with related investments, and in designing investments, the Bank and the Government piloted 
innovative techniques that were later scaled up (like private participation in the water sector). A strong 
local staff as well as effective PIUs have contributed to a well run portfolio.  In addition, the Bank has 
carried out diagnostic work and develop options in a timely manner for the government (for example, in 
providing just-in-time policy notes for the new Government in FY08) and these have also fed into new 
Bank operations (as recommended by the previous CAS Completion Report).  Analytic work has also 
been notable in ensuring the product was fully owned by the client (for example, the PEFA or the Poverty 
Assessment).  The result has been a steady approach to reform avoiding wide swings in policy or 
direction. Admittedly in certain areas such as governance, progress has not been as fast as had been 
hoped.  More could also be done by the IFC if the corporate environment were to improve.  

IV.  

Lessons and Recommendations 

90. 
The Armenian experience shows that reform works well when there is steady commitment to 
reform over more than a decade.  Armenia’s outstanding performance on growth and poverty reduction 
during the CAS period has strong roots in its early and sustained commitment to rely on the private sector 
to generate economic activity and employment, with a vision of a limited and effective state.  The 

59 

 
 
 
 
Government has used a medium term planning approach through the PRSP and the MTEF as a powerful 
disciplining devise.  Likewise, the strength of the Bank’s engagement can be traced not just to its 
activities during the CAS period but a long and deep relationship of trust built over more than a decade.  
This includes a strong local country office staff and effective PIUs that have contributed to the policy 
dialogue and a well run portfolio.  All this provided fertile ground for the Bank’s annual budget support 
operation as well as just in time analytic work (for example, policy papers for the new Government in 
FY08) to yield results.    

91. 
A key element in making the Bank’s program eff ective has been the complementary re-enforcing 
package of annual policy support, related investments, and selected analytic work.  For example, health 
investments were combined with health policy targets in the DPL as well as a Public Expenditure analysis 
focusing on the health sector.  By making these interventions focused and complementary, the Bank 
leveraged modest resources to obtain results.    

92. 
The use of programmatic instruments, focusing work in areas that the Bank has built up expertise 
over a long time period, has enabled it provide quick and expert support.  On the policy side, each annual 
program has built on the achievements of the previous one.  In investments, many interventions (such as 
water, judicial, health) have built on past efforts, mostly as APLs or Additional Finance.  Several pieces 
of analytic work have also been programmatic in nature, including the annual poverty assessment and 
public expenditure review. At the same time, the Bank should also stand ready to respond to emerging 
priorities (as it did for Avian Influenza). 

93. 
Public/private partnerships and making local public service entities more autonomous works in 
Armenia. The Bank has explored public private partnership through the FIEF operation, through 
supporting management contracts in the provision of water services, and in the provision of road services.  
This experience has generally been positive and suggests it could be scaled up to other sectors.  Similarly, 
the Government has improved services in health and education by increasing local autonomy in schools 
and hospitals, while strengthening their financing and accountability.     

94. 
Results indicators need to be chosen which are both relevant and easily measured.   Where 
results indicators relied on those measured by the Government in the PRSP or the annual Poverty 
Assessment or surveys under specific Bank projects, they have proven robust and useful.  Other results 
indicators (for example, relying on the BEEPS) have run into difficulty as they rely on efforts outside of 
the team or Government.  It is also important not to set indicators too high on the results chain (i.e. 
general satisfaction with judicial services or changes in the public’s he alth behavior) raising questions as 
to whether the indicators accurately gauge impact of the Bank’s program. 

95. 
 The vulnerability of growth continues to be a concern.  As a small economy, Armenia will be 
unlikely to achieve full diversification.  Rather, the focus should be on:  (a) reducing barriers to accessing 
external markets (customs, air travel, rail, roads, etc.); (b) creating an investment environment that favors 
entry and innovation; and (c) provisions to soften external shocks (such as a sound financial sector, 
improved corporate governance and careful debt management).  Rural development poses a particular 
challenge as it still employs a substantial percentage of the population and has increased at a slower rate 
than the overall economy.  In developing a policy response to external shocks, it would be particularly 
important to resist protectionist tendencies and continue to build an open and competitive economy, while 
protecting the poor and those people most affected. 

96. 
Further progress on governance is likely to depend on clear high level commitment rather than 
technical fixes. Early moves on governance ranked the country high in ECA but now other countries are 
catching up and in some cases passing Armenia by.  While the Government is improving the management 
of taxes and customs, these continue to show up as areas of high concern to the population (though there 
may be some lags related to recent reforms).  Many areas of governance reforms – like public 

60 

 
 
administration, civil service reform, and the establishment of a level playing field for businesses – will 
likely require a concerted effort over a long period of time.   A more transparent business environment 
and improved corporate governance would strengthen the sustainability of growth and improve 
competitiveness, while also enabling greater IFC operations. 

97. 
The shift to IBRD lending will bring about changes. Armenia will become a blend country during 
the next CAS.   This will provide Armenia with more funding options to choose from and with a greater 
funding envelope.  A likely greater emphasis on infrastructure is therefore expected, but this should not 
come at the expense of capacity building and the social sector.  Middle income status is also likely to 
intensify expectations of high quality (which the Bank has thus far met in Armenia).  It will also be 
important to strengthen collaboration across the Bank group, including IDA, IBRD, IFC and MIGA.   

98. 
There is an opportunity to build and gradually rely more on country systems.  A modest 
foundation has been established in the current CAS with many PIUs now integrated into Ministries.  
However, further strengthening of procurement and financial management beyond Bank projects is 
needed.  The use of the country PFM systems for projects implementation is currently being discussed 
with the government. The country system elements to be used under Bank projects in the CPS period are 
planned to include the Treasury system for maintaining the projects designated accounts. The other 
country systems will be assessed to be used as the government progresses with the PFM reforms. 
Particularly, the accounting system will be used upon introduction of IPSAS and automated accounting 
system by the government, and auditing - when the COC develops adequate capacity to conduct audits 
following international auditing standards.  The government staffing and internal controls will be used, 
when the designed public internal audit system is introduced.  The challenge forward will be to preserve 
the capital and experience that has accumulated in PIUs while strengthening country systems and line 
ministries, in both policy and administrative areas.

the focus should be on 
sustainability.  
reducing barriers to 
markets and improving 
the investment 
environment  
   Early on Armenia 
posted an investment 
climate and quality of 
governance that stood out 
among CIS and ECA 
countries. However, 
Armenia is falling behind 
competitors.  Although 
technical improvements 
are being made, further 
progress on results will 
depend on clear 
commitment of the 
Government to improve 
governance (particularly 
in tax and customs) 

Comprehensive budget, 
following updated 
classification, well 
aligned with PRSP. Up-
to-date reporting on 
budget execution. 
Unified single treasury in 
place. The main gaps 
concern implementation 
of internal controls.  
Improved reporting and 
oversight of non-
financial enterprises.  
Improvement in public 
procurement currently 
being assessed (via the 
CPAR).   

-- Budget system still 
has problems, 
especially for budget 
classification, 
expenditure 
rationalization and 
reallocation, budget 
formulation, and 
financial reporting of 
non-financial 
enterprises. Public 
procurement lacks 
transparency. 

-- Concerns that 
inadequate levels of 
public financing could 
impair financing of 
basic services 
fostering social 
instability  

Government agencies 
at central and local 
levels lack motivated 
staff and efficient 
systems.  

First phase of judicial 
reforms has not yet led 
to a completely 
independent judiciary.  
Enforcement of court 
decisions often 
delayed and 
inconsistent. 
Unclear and 
inefficient procedures 
to enable citizens to 
protest against 
government agency 
acts.  

Real resources available 
to the government 
increased with rising 
income; in addition the 
ratio of tax to GDP went 
from 14 percent in 2003 
to 16.1 percent in 2007.   

Public salaries increased 
as a percentage of GDP. 
Civil service law 
mandating merit hiring 
under implementation. 
Fiscal sources of local 
governments 
strengthened.  

Constitutional 
amendments set basis for 
an independent and 
effective judiciary;

(ii) Financial services 
adequate for private 
sector growth.  

Low loans to/GDP 
ratio reduces stability 
of the banking sector 

Corporate governance 
of the banking sector 
is weak.  

There are no credit 
bureaus to monitor 
credit operations, 
which reduces 
confidence in banks.  

Debt recovery through 
the judicial system is 
unreliable.  

Financial 
intermediation is 
available only at a 
high cost. 

(iii) Communications 
infrastructure 
promotes economic 
growth. 

Telecoms constrain to 
private sector 
development because 
lack of competition 
was leading to: low 
quality, high cost 
services, especially 
corporate networks 
and internet; limited 
reach especially rural 

Available statistics show 
(a) improved operation 
and transparency of 
judicial system and (b) 
greater user satisfactory 
with court services 
improving.  
Loans to GDP increase to 
13.58 percent in 2007 
compared to 5.68 percent 
in 2003.   

Umbrella finance 
regulatory agency under 
Central Bank in place 
implementing Basle 
principles has brought 
banking corporate 
governance to 
international standards.  

Legislative changes 
strengthening creditor 
rights, improving civil 
procedures for debt 
recovery, and simplifying 
procedures for 
certification of property 
sales and registration of 
secured credit. These 
legislative changes 
jointly with a new facility 
for registering pledges of 
movable property in the 
central cadastre registry 
provide an adequate legal 
framework for most 
secure transactions in 
Armenia. 
Interest rates still high 
despite bank 
consolidation driven by 
higher minimum capital 
requirements and 
competition from foreign 
banks.  
Telecom monopoly 
eliminated; sector open to 
competition, three 
telecom operators now in 
place.   
Umbrella regulatory 
agency (PRSC) for 
services covers energy, 
telecom, railways and 
water.  Significant 

64 

Strong regulatory 
oversight and competition 
have provided a less 
vulnerable financial 
sector.  Nevertheless, 
there is potential to 
further consolidate the 
sector, increase access, 
and reduce rates.    
Improvements in non-
financial corporate 
governance would 
improve conditions to 
deepen the non-banking 
financial sector and 
finance the upgrading of 
the productive capacity of 
the country.  

Progress made in lifting 
perceived constraints in 
electricity, 
telecommunications and 
to a lesser extent land 
transport; however, 
Armenia remains 
challenged in accessing 
external markets and an 
aggressive approach to 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
areas.  
Transport of people 
and goods is time 
consuming and 
expensive especially 
in rural communities.  

Capacity to enforce 
environmental impact 
assessment legislation 
is weak.  
Deforestation and 
poor land management 
further impoverish 
poor people and 
increase impact of 
natural disasters 

improvements in the 
availability and reliability 
of basic services.  
Railroad concession 
issued.  
Ongoing progress to open 
air travel to competition 
and by-pass pre-existing 
privileges.  
Law on forestry/logging 
and agency responsible 
for its enforcement in 
place.  
A larger number of 
communities capable of 
managing commons 
(forests/watershed.)  
Eliminated risks posed by 
old dams to around half a 
million people.   

Goal Two: Make growth more pro-poor

percent of households in 
1999 to 25 percent in 
2007. Absolute poverty 
fell from 21 percent in 
1999 to 3.8 percent 2007. 

(iv) Economic growth 
based on more 
sustainable use of 
natural resources.  

A larger share of the 
population benefits 
from economic growth 
and the vulnerable are 
adequately protected.  

(i) More people benefit 
from economic growth. 

Growth has 
concentrated in the 
urban areas (Yerevan 
and others.) Informal 
economy at 45% of 
formal economy.  
Information about the 
job market difficult 
for the unemployed to 
access.  

Growth spreads outside 
Yerevan, including rural 
areas.  Official estimates 
put informal economy at 
35% of formal economy.  
2004 Labor Code 
introduces flexibility into 
the labor market.  
Government commenced 
implementation of the 
recommendations of the 
Labor Market study to 
improve availability of 
information, matching, 
etc. Preliminary results 
are encouraging 
including high 
satisfaction (77%) of job-
seekers with services 
provided by state 
employment service.  
Since 2001 agriculture 
value added and 
productivity have grown

(ii) Rural areas do not 
have entrenched 
poverty. 

Only small share of 
farmers produce 
agriculture surplus 

improve logistics and 
reduce the cost of 
accessing external 
markets is much needed 
(customs, roads and 
railways, aviation, 
standards, etc.)  

Government has worked 
on a selected set of 
priority environmental 
issues (forestry, dam 
risks); for the future, the 
government needs to 
identify priorities out of a 
broader environment 
agenda. Current 
analytical work by the 
Bank can help prioritize 
and cost an agenda.  

Strong analytic support 
based on Government 
ownership.  Progress in 
poverty reduction 
supported by Bank 
programs in rural areas 
and social protection (and 
also rapidly growing 
remittances).  Still many 
people are clustered just 
above the poverty line so 
vulnerable to shocks.  
Concerns remain with 
underemployment given 
low labor force 
participation. Attention to 
the quality of growth and 
matching of skills 
continue to merit 
attention.  The role of 
Armenians working 
abroad and remittances 
on underemployment 
needs further analytic 
work.  

Multiple harmonized 
operations (land tenure, 
irrigation, technology 

 
 
 
because irrigation is 
unreliable, lack of 
improved inputs, 
technologies and 
marketing difficulties.  

Institutional reforms 
in agriculture not yet 
complete. 

Agriculture vulnerable 
to natural disasters. 

Few opportunities for 
off-farm income 
generation.  

(iii) The vulnerable are 
adequately efficiently 
protected.  

Pensions too low —
21% of average wage 
in 2003.  

Administration of cash 
transfers is not 
efficient enough and 
leads to wastage and 
unnecessary delays.  

Benefit system is not 
transparent enough, 
leading to confusion 
amongst potentially 
eligible beneficiaries.  

transfer, credit, etc.) 
helped integrate 
agriculture into the 
national economy and 
benefit from the rapidly 
growing demand.  

Still, productivity growth 
has been lower than in 
the general economy and 
absorbing a sizeable 
percentage of the 
population the rural areas 
remain fragile.   

High income growth 
facilitates targeting by (a) 
providing public 
resources and (b) by 
reducing the number of 
eligible beneficiaries.  

While a more efficient 
system of social 
assistance is in place, 
efforts should be made to 
make it easy for the poor 
to access benefits and for 
improved accuracy of 
screening.  
Improved targeting and 
efficiency needed to face 
up to difficult situations 
to come. 

rapidly  driven by 
irrigation improvements 
(increased area, greater 
efficiency in use of 
electricity, less losses of 
water), access to quality 
inputs,  technology, and 
marketing infrastructure.  
 Stronger rural 
institutions including: (a) 
11 autonomous 
technology centers and 
(b) water management 
associations covering all 
irrigated areas in the 
country. New SEEDS 
law in place and 
investments in testing 
labs. New water 
management institutions 
and investments have 
reduced demand for 
electricity and overall 
costs.   
Significant reduction in 
rural vulnerability to 
natural disasters.  
With economic growth 
off-farm opportunities in 
rural areas have 
increased.  
Real pensions increased 
rapidly with wages, even 
if ratio of pensions to 
average wage remained 
constant around 20 
percent.  In addition, 
pension/average wage 
increased to 25% in 
2008.  
Targeting of social 
assistance improves (76.7 
of the family benefits go 
to the poorest two 
quintiles.)   
Satisfaction with social 
benefits system improves 
(94.8 % of pensions and 
92.6% of social 
assistance delivered on 
time. 78.3% percent of 
pension and 82.2% of 
pension beneficiaries are 
satisfied.  
Pensions and social 
benefits have contributed 
to the reduction in 
poverty (In the absence

Maintain well 
educated population 
with increased share of 
people completing 
appropriate skills 
training and finding 
employment in 
changing economy. 

(ii) Increase overall 
health status of the 
population. 

Steady long-term 
commitment to 
improving education has 
paid-off. The system of 
per-capital grants and 
school autonomy is 
firmly in place. General 
secondary education has 
posted major 
improvements in access, 
efficiency, and quality. 
The gaps are in pre-
school and tertiary 
education.  Attention to 
skills is also needed to 
help the reconversion of 
the economy.  

Curriculum is not 
appropriate; 
Skills  and incentives 
for teachers do not 
match needs of a 
market economy 
Inadequate facilities 
and equipment 
(including heating and 
information 
technology.)  
Children, especially 
lower income boys, 
are not motivated to 
stay in secondary 
school. 
Enrollment in pre-
school is low, 
particularly among the 
poor, and particularly 
outside Yerevan.  

poverty would have risen 
from 26.5 to 32.8 percent 
in 2006.)   
Goal Three: Reduce Non-income Poverty 
(Population has adequate basic services (health education, water, waste water treatment, heat and 
transport.)  
Updated Secondary 
Education Curriculum; 
Budgetary allocations to 
education increase from 
2.2 in 1997 to 2.96% in 
2007. Annual average 
teacher salary from 43%

2003 to 100% in 2008. 
Ambitious re-training 
program implemented;   
General secondary 
education extended to 12 
years with 10 mandatory; 
Cohort from 7 to 15 is in 
school close to 100%; 
Gross enrolment rate for 
upper secondary 
(voluntary) education at 
89 %, net at 70 %. 
Enrollment in pre-school 
remains low, at around 
22%. 
Higher allocation of 
public resources to health 
with additional resources 
targeted to Primary 
Health care system —
from 1.2 % in 2003 to 
1.5% in 2007.  
Access of the poor to the 
basic health system 
improves (gap in access 
of bottom and top 
quintile has closed.)  
Informal payments 
reduced, but still high; 
Health improvements as 
measured by secular 
increase in life 
expectancy---.from 66.4 
years in 2000 to 72.4 
years in 2008. 
New institutional 
framework for the 
delivery of water and 
sewage in place based on 
regulation and private 
participation. 
There has been a 
substantial progress on 
water. In Yerevan, 

Broadly defined Primary 
Health Care induces side-
payments and reduces 
satisfaction; therefore, 
streamline Primary 
Health Care introducing 
official premium and 
protect the poor.  
Continue increasing 
budgetary allocations to 
health. Improve tracking 
and monitoring to 
ascertain effectiveness.  
Continue hospital 
rationalization.  

People cannot afford 
services because 
formal and informal 
payments are high; 

Public expenditures on 
health are low and 
poorly targeted 
(hospitals absorbed 
53% of public health 
expenditures in 2001); 
Women ’s 
reproductive health 
may be deteriorating. 
People engage too 
often in risk behavior.  

Sequential approach to 
address energy situation 
and bringing private 
agents under the umbrella 
of a regulatory 
framework worked in 
Armenia. Given the 
difficulties the same 
approach has experienced 

(iii) The population 
has increased access to 
basic infrastructure 
services, which 
improves their quality 
of life 

The poor financial 
conditions of utilities 
have prevented 
investment in 
infrastructure. 

Crumbling water and 
sanitation 
infrastructure is

in other countries, the 
Armenian experience 
should be studied for the 
lessons it can teach 
others.  The investment 
needs continue to be 
great.  

leading to increasing 
rates and/or sudden 
outbreaks of water 
borne deceases.  

Many urban 
households are forced 
to heat with wood, 
which is expensive 
and has environmental 
costs.  

supported by the 
Municipal Development 
and a subsequent 
Yerevan Water Supply 
Projects, hours of water 
availability increased 
from 7 in 2003 to 19.5 
hours in 2007, and 
around 74% of Yerevan 
population has 24 hour 
service. The availability 
of safe drinking water is 
over 95 percent in 
Yerevan and most urban 
centers.  Under the 
Municipal Water & 
Wastewater Project, these 
efforts are expanded 
outside Yerevan and it is 
estimated that 25.8% of 
the population in the 
service area now has 
access to 24 hour water 
supply.  

With development 
partners ’ support efforts 
to improve water 
sanitation services cover 
most of the country (with 
the exception of some 
self-served rural 
communities). 
World Bank support for 
gas-based heating has 
already produced positive 
results (46% percent of 
households in multi-
apartment buildings 
utilize safe and clean gas- 
based heating solutions in 
2006-2007 as opposed to 
11 percent in 2003-
2004.)

Annex III 

Annex 3:  Public Consultations on the CPS 

The public consultations held in Yerevan reviewed the directions of the proposed Country Partnership 
Strategy for Armenia, as well as specific programs. Bank staff met with representatives of NGOs, 
academia, professional associations, think-tanks, private/banking sector representatives, and the 
media. Background presentations were delivered to initiate public feedback and comments.  The main 
issues discussed are as follows:  

Progress of Reforms. The pace and scope of reforms was a recurrent issue in the consultations. 
Participants noticed that reforms could have been more visible, while there is a growing public 
demand for higher public sector efficiency. Despite the crisis, stronger commitment and political will 
are required to make real changes. Moreover, the level of public participation in the planning stage of 
reforms and the actual decision making is deemed insufficient.  

Governance and Anti Corruption. Improving governance and reducing corruption is a challenge for 
Armenia ’s development agenda and pe rceived by most participants as a key precondition for high and 
sustained growth. The Bank’s role is seen as decisive in helping raise the efficiency of judiciary and 
enforcing existing regulations. Enforcing laws on management of conflict of interest situations 
involving public officials is seen as particularly important for promoting a competitive business 
environment. Participants proposed bigger involvement of the Bank in the Government’s anti-
corruption strategy. 

Competitiveness. The participants unanimously agreed with the focus of the CPS on boosting the 
economy’s competitiveness. The Bank’s role in providing further advice and assistance through 
structural reforms to improve the investment climate and promote competitiveness is rated as 
prominent.  

E-society.  Private sector representatives stressed the importance of investments that promote the 
high-tech sector and the knowledge-based economy, in order to take advantage of the country’s 
human potential. This could open new horizons for the younger generation among which the 
emigration tendencies are still high. 

Local Self-Governance. The Bank was also recommended to intensify its work with local 
governments, which are seen as effective counterparts in some areas. Further decentralization of 
government functions could lead to more inclusive governance and support economic development in 
rural areas, where the poverty rates are still high.  

Agriculture. Participants mentioned the need for promotion of lower-cost lending instruments for 
farmers. The lack of proper access to financing is seen as an obstacle for the rural economy as a 
whole, and a condition for boosting export of agricultural products. The Bank’s continuous 
involvement in rural infrastructure improvement, including in irrigation, is seen as key for the 
development of the sector. 

Environment.  The participants are concerned with the excessive use of natural resources in the 
country and the lack of proper capacity for environmental impact assessments. They would like to see 
continuous emphasis on environmental protection in the Bank’s CPS, linking it to improvement in the 
quality of people’s lives. 

Media Freedom. The participants see insufficient media freedom in the country, which could slow 
progress towards better accountability at all levels of governance and the eradication of corruption. 

79 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Armenia’s performance has slightly worsened accordin g to the Governance Indicators, especially in 
terms of Voice and Accountability index.  

Monitoring and participation. Civil society representatives expressed their readiness to take a 
bigger role in monitoring and supporting the implementation of the Bank’s activities in Armenia. 
Greater civil society participation could help the Bank better assess the effectiveness of project 
implementation and mitigate risks of corruption.
