EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

i. 
This country assistance strategy —prepared 
jointly by the World Bank, the African 
Development Bank (ADB) Group, and the International Finance Corporation—sets out 
planned lending and non-lending support by the World Bank Group and African 
Development Bank to Liberia over the period FY09-12 (April 2009-June 2011).  

ii. 
Liberia’s economy, institutions, and human capacity were devastated by the 
country’s 14-year civil war, which ended in 2003 .  Since then, this country of about 3.5 
million people has made important progress despite the considerable difficulties and risks that 
remain.  It has held elections, reestablished a public financial management system, begun 
rebuilding public sector institutions, reestablished the delivery of some essential public services, 
and laid the foundations of a local government system.  

iii. 
A twelve-month Joint Interim Strategy for mid-2007 to mid-2008 provided a 
framework for the engagement of the World Bank Group1 and the African Development 
Bank under the rubric of Liberia ’s Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) .2,3 The 
Interim Strategy focused on rebuilding the shattered institutions of the state, as well as the 
infrastructure desperately needed to jump-start economic growth.  Most of the activities pursued 
under this strategy are still in progress.  The ongoing World Bank portfolio of US$160 million 
and ADB portfolio of US$39 million include operations supporting economic governance, 
transport, basic services, and capacity development.  Despite significant constraints stemming 
from lack of capacity, uneven governance, and implementation difficulties, the World Bank 
program has begun to deliver results.  In addition, the African Development Bank program 
introduced under the Interim Strategy is now largely in place, and intermediate results will be 
tangible during the CAS period. 

iv. 
The government has made great strides over the past year, but, like most very poor 
countries, Liberia is likely to be negatively affected in the near-term by the global financial 
crisis and economic slowdown.  The clearance of more than US$1.5 billion in arrears with the 
World Bank, the ADB, and the IMF has opened the door to development programs with the 
international financial institutions and unblocked the path to full debt relief under the 
Multilateral Debt Reduction Initiative.  Prospects are good for settling a large commercial debt 
inherited from past regimes.  In addition, Liberia has shown its commitment to maintaining its 
strong macroeconomic program, the good governance reforms, and the anti-corruption efforts 
that underpinned a first development policy operation under the World Bank Group’s new 
program.  Nonetheless, the country is extremely vulnerable to the ongoing global economic 
slowdown, remaining very poor, highly dependent on a few primary export commodities (mainly 
rubber), as well as on foreign capital, remittances, and on imported food and fuel.

v. 
The government’s first full Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS), introduced in March 
2008, and covers the period 2008–2011.  Based on extensive consultations and a thorough 
poverty analysis, the PRS has four core strategic areas of intervention: peace and security; 
economic revitalization; governance and rule of law; and infrastructure and basic services.  In 
addition, it pursues a number of priority crosscutting themes, including gender equity, peace-
building, environmental issues, HIV and AIDS, children and youth, and monitoring and 
evaluation. 

vi. 
The Joint Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of the World Bank Group and the 
ADB Group is fully aligned with the PRS and is designed to support Liberia ’s transition 
from post-conflict recovery to long-term development.  To address some key constraints on 
growth, as well as to enhance the policy and institutional framework to ensure that growth is 
increasingly pro-poor, the CAS will pursue three strategic themes: (i) rebuilding core state 
functions and institutions; (ii) rehabilitating infrastructure to jump-start economic growth; and 
(iii) facilitating pro-poor growth.  The strategy will also pursue the crosscutting objective of 
capacity development.  Gender and the environment are important elements that will be 
increasingly mainstreamed into World Bank Group and ADB programs.  The activities supported 
will be consistent with a regional integration perspective, given the government’s expressed 
interest in achieving benefits from West African regional integration.  Though the full 
implications of the global economic slowdown are not known yet, the two banks will tailor their 
assistance to help Liberia provide social protection while improving its macroeconomic 
management. 

vii. 
The focus of the CAS is selective, given Liberia’s limited implementation capacity.  
New projects are carefully targeted, largely avoiding entry into new sectors.  The choice of 
activities is consistent with the comparative advantages of both banks as well as the leadership of 
other donors in certain thematic areas, and with the government’s expressed wish to focus of the 
bulk of new investment finance on rebuilding transport and other infrastructure.  

viii. The following measurable improvements are expected by the end of the CAS 
period4:  

• 

• 

• 
• 
• 

Improved efficiency of government budget preparation and execution, and enhanced 
revenue administration; 
Increased professionalization and human resource management of the civil service; 
Improved access to key infrastructure services; 
Improved agricultural productivity and production; 
• More effective management of natural resources;   
• A better business and investment climate; and 
Increased access to social protection in the face of shocks 

ix. 
Under the CAS, both the World Bank Group and the ADB Group will continue 
their current activities in Liberia while also providing new financing and analytical and 
advisory services.  The World Bank Group proposes to deepen its work on public financial 
management and institutional reform, financial sector development and access to finance; expand

its infrastructure and agriculture development programs; and intensify its support for natural 
resource-led but pro-poor growth.  The program will be supported by a combination of IDA 
(US$138 million over the three-year CAS period), regional funding of around $160 million, IFC 
investments and advisory work, and trust-fund financing (approximately US$310 million), 
including through a new multilateral donor trust fund for infrastructure, the Liberia 
Reconstruction and Development Trust Fund, that the World Bank will administer.  The bulk of 
IDA ’s financing is for high-priority infrastructure development.  Budget support is intended to 
provide a signal to other development partners to channel more resources through Liberia’s 
budget.  The World Bank will work flexibly to ensure that its activities respond to the challenges 
posed by the global financial crisis.  Emphasis will be placed on labor-intensive public works, 
technical assistance in the areas of public financial management and procurement, and advisory 
services in the real sectors.  The IFC program focuses on improving the investment climate, 
strengthening the financial sector, facilitating the revival of agribusiness, and advising and 
participating in investments in the real sector, as well as supporting the emergence of small and 
medium-size enterprises linked to the bigger projects being implemented in the country.  IFC is 
working closely with the two banks on public-private partnership solutions to Liberia ’s vast 
infrastructure reconstruction needs. 

x. 
The African Development Bank Group plans to provide an indicative US$88 million 
in new financing from the African Development Fund (ADF) and Fragile States Facility 
(FSF), subject to Liberia’s eligibility to the FSF .  New projects will provide continued support 
for governance reform and for rehabilitating and extending water supply and sanitation, and will 
help to scale up agricultural productivity through rural infrastructure support and agricultural 
production development and marketing.  Potential new investments through the ADB’s private 
sector window will target the banking, mining, and renewable energy sectors.  

xi. 
Analytical and advisory work by the World Bank Group and ADB will be aligned 
with the strategic themes and crosscutting issues of the CAS, and will focus on creating the 
knowledge base for strong policy advice and on identifying specific strategies for enhancing pro-
poor growth.  The World Bank Group ’s work program addresses economic management, 
financial sector reform, women ’s economic empowerment, and pro-poor growth.  ADB’s 
program includes a water sector reform study and action plan, a public expenditure and 
financial assessment, a gender profile, a fragile states needs assessment study, and analytic work 
recommended by the latter study.  

xii. 
Implementation of the CAS is subject to three broad risks.  The first is a large risk of 
external shocks, not only of lower demand and lower prices for Liberia’s key exports but also of 
a slowdown in aid and foreign direct investment inflows, reduced remittances from abroad for 
poor households, and difficulty in importing food and fuel caused by difficulties in obtaining 
trade finance.  A second key risk is related to insecurity and a return to conflict, particularly in 
light of the gradual UN troop drawdown.  Related to this is a significant political and corruption 
risk, as vested interests with varying degrees of commitment to reform compete for scarce 
resources.  Third, Liberia’s fundamental lack of capacity creates enormous implementation risks.  
Though the two banks cannot seek to provide a comprehensive approach to the security and 
political risks inherent in Liberia’s post-conflict environment, the Joint Strategy is designed 
specifically to target risky areas and provide support and incentives for Liberia to continue 
xi

 
current reform efforts.  The close dialogue with the International Monetary Fund under the 
macroeconomic reform program, along with social protection provided through community 
development and cash for work programs, will also help mitigate risks of instability.  Projects 
will be carefully designed to offset corruption risks, while simultaneously building local 
implementation capacity.

I. INTRODUCTION 

1.      This Country Assistance Strategy—prepared jointly by the World Bank, the 
African Development Bank Group, and the International Finance Corporation —sets out 
planned lending and non-lending support by the World Bank Group and African 
Development Bank Group to Liberia over the period FY09-12 (July 2008-June 2011).  The 
joint strategy (CAS) is rooted in a results-based framework and aligned with the priorities set out 
in Liberia ’s PRSP, which the World Bank Board discussed in August 2008.  As the country 
emerges from the immediate post-conflict period, its central challenge is to deepen its reforms 
and strengthen its institutional capacity, in pursuit of stability and shared and sustained growth 
over the medium term.  On this basis, the CAS has three main objectives: (i) rebuilding core state 
functions and institutions; (ii) rehabilitating infrastructure to jump-start economic growth; and 
(iii) facilitating pro-poor growth, with capacity development as an important crosscutting theme.  
Initiatives to address gender and environmental sustainability are integrated throughout the 
strategy, which also respects the importance of efforts to promote West African regional 
integration.  

2.      Both the World Bank Group and the ADB Group will provide new financing while 
continuing their current activities in Liberia.  From the World Bank, planned new IDA grant 
financing —of US$138 million over the three-year CAS period —will be complemented by 
expected trust-fund financing of approximately US$140 million.  The bulk of the World Bank’s 
financing is for infrastructure development, particularly in the transport sector—the highest 
priority identified in the PRSP.  The Bank will also scale up its support for governance reform, 
and work to put in place the foundations of shared growth.  Budget support is intended to provide 
a signal to other development partners to channel more resources through Liberia’s budget.  The 
Bank will work flexibly to ensure that its activities respond to the challenges posed by the global 
financial crisis, working through existing institutions and emphasizing labor-intensive public 
works, technical assistance in the areas of public financial management and procurement, and 
advisory services in the real sectors.  The IFC program focuses on improving the investment 
climate, strengthening the financial sector, facilitating the revival of agribusiness, and advising 
and participating in investments in the real sector, as well as supporting the emergence of small 
and medium-size enterprises linked to the bigger projects being implemented in the country.  IFC 
is working closely with the World Bank and the ADB on public-private partnership solutions in 
infrastructure.  The African Development Bank Group plans to provide an indicative US$88 
million in new financing from the African Development Fund (ADF) and Fragile States Facility 
(FSF), should eligibility to financing under the Fragile States Facility (FSF) be granted.  ADB’s 
new projects will provide continued support for governance reform and for rehabilitating and 
extending water supply and sanitation, and will help scale up agricultural productivity through 
rural infrastructure support and agricultural production development and marketing.  Potential 
new investments through the ADB’s private sector window will target the banking, mining, and 
renewable energy sectors.

II. COUNTRY CONTEXT AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 

A. Country and Political Context 

3.      Liberia’s economy, institutions, and human capacity were devastated by the 
country’s 14 year civil war, which ended in 2003 .  The 2003 Accra Comprehensive Peace 
accord and the deployment of a UN peacekeeping force have provided much-needed space to lay 
a solid foundation for recovery. Since that time, Liberia has made important progress, holding 
elections, re-establishing a public financial management system, beginning to rebuild public 
sector institutions, delivering some essential public services, and laying the foundations of a 
local government system.   

4.      Both the World Bank Group and the ADB Group have been assisting Liberia since 
the conflict ended.  The World Bank Group has focused on emergency stabilization support, to 
begin rebuilding state institutions and restoring public services.  During this period, it has 
supported basic economic governance reforms, community-driven development for service 
delivery, and emergency infrastructure rehabilitation.  ADB provided emergency assistance in 
the health sector in 2001 and 2003 as well as statistical capacity building assistance in 2005, all 
through grant resources.  Since 2005, ADB has been assisting Liberia to rehabilitate and extend 
infrastructure, strengthen institutional capacity through good governance and economic policy 
reform, and address its debt and arrears. 

5.      The government ’s top concern is to stimu late economic growth, by getting major 
transport corridors functioning to open up trade and commerce, revitalizing agriculture, 
and rebuilding Liberia’s devastated energy infrastructure .  Job creation is also crucially 
important, particularly in the short term, to ensure that citizens see tangible benefits from peace 
and reform.  On the policy side, the government is beginning to consolidate economic 
governance reforms, moving beyond the Governance and Economic Management Assistance 
Program (GEMAP)5 to fully owned and functioning public financial management, and to rebuild 
state institutions, including the civil service.  The government is also beginning to rebuild state 
capacity for basic service delivery in health and education, as the NGOs that provided relief 
services during wartime dismantle their operations. 

6.      The political situation remains fragile.  Popular expectations for tangible peace 
dividends remain high.  Strained relations between the Executive and the opposition-controlled 
Parliament have complicated the passage of new legislation necessary to enforce reforms, and 
the delicate political balance constantly threatens the gains made on governance and against 
corruption.  Ongoing Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings are contributing to a 
national dialogue around the events of the war.  The government has taken important actions to 
prevent corruption, including adopting a national anti-corruption policy and strategic framework 
measures designed to reduce corruption, but a perception persists of a culture of impunity for

corruption; GEMAP instituted strong expenditure controls in the Ministry of Finance and introduced a zero-
tolerance policy on corruption.

wrongdoers.6  Finally, Liberia’s fragile economic recovery is threatened by the global economic 
crisis, which could further exacerbate domestic tensions. 

7.      Strong international support has helped to consolidate peace and security.  UNMIL 
has deployed 15,000 peacekeepers and 1,115 police personnel to Liberia.  By early 2007, 
UNMIL had disarmed and demobilized about 102,000 combatants and rehabilitated some 65,000 
of them, though about 37,000 ex-combatants remained to be placed in reintegration programs.  
UNMIL and its partners have also supported the restructuring of the national police and army 
and the re-establishment of state authority throughout the country.  Presently there are 10,231 
peacekeepers and 1,226 police personnel in Liberia, with another draw down of 2,000 military 
personnel expected to begin in September 2009.  A recent assessment concluded that this 
drawdown in coming years would progress more slowly than originally envisaged, in order to 
prevent a premature return to instability.  While security along Liberia’s borders with Sierra 
Leone, Cote d’Ivoire, and Guinea is stable at present, ongoing crises in several neighboring 
countries remain cause for concern.  

8.      Donors have rallied around the new Liberian government, providing significant 
support.  However, because of the weakness of Liberia’s state systems and capacity, most of 
their aid remains off budget and outside of country systems.  The challenge is now to move 
beyond humanitarian to development assistance, to scale up small, transaction-intensive 
interventions, and increase efficiency by moving aid on to the government budget in ways that 
improve domestic capacity. 

B. Economic Context and Outlook 

9.      Liberia’s economy collapsed during the war .  Liberia is a small, open economy 
strongly dependent on trade.  Traditional exports included rubber, cocoa, and more recently iron 
ore, palm oil, gold, diamonds, and forest products.  During the 1960s and 1970s, the economy 
grew rapidly, spurred mainly by exports of mining products (primarily iron ore) and rubber.  But 
mining and rubber production were enclave industries that benefited the political elite 
disproportionately and did not sustain poverty reduction.  Though real GDP in 1980 reached 
US$890 per capita, the economy began losing momentum soon afterwards, partly because of the 
second oil shock, and the festering social discontent erupted into brutal civil war in 1989.  The 
economy contracted sharply during the hostilities, and though it began to recover during a hiatus 
in the conflict between 1997 and 2001, it slumped again during the two subsequent years of war.  

10.      Since the peace accord in 2003, the economy has posted a strong recovery.  Real 
GDP growth gathered speed, spurred by agriculture, retail trade, communications, 
transport, and construction, and, as the security situation improved, both foreign and 
domestic investment in Liberia expanded.  A strong recovery in export growth in 2005 and 
2006 was based mostly on rubber; large-scale mining and timber production have not yet 
recommenced.  Looking ahead, the prospects are favorable for further strong GDP growth as 

6 In principle, civil society will have an important role to play in curbing corruption in Liberia, by holding 
government to account and demanding transparency, but at present it lacks the necessary capacity.

security continues to improve.  Higher private sector-led investment, including substantial 
foreign direct investment, can be expected in the key export sectors of forestry and mining. 
Vigorous growth in construction is expected to continue and a recovery in agriculture is expected 
to pick up pace with the strong demand for food and higher food prices.

11.      Liberia ’s economic recovery has produced a consistent rise in fiscal revenues, albeit 
from a very low base.  Total tax revenues reached 22 percent of GDP in 2006/07, coming from 
international trade (50 percent), income (30 percent), and domestic goods and services (19 
percent).  The government’s commitment to cash-based budgeting has helped to keep spending 
in line with revenues, in the face of enormous demand for public spending.  Liberia ’s per capita 
public spending (US$40 per capita in FY06/07) is among the lowest in the world, and is 
insufficient to meet the country’s vast reconstruction needs.  Thus, Liberia depends heavily on 
aid, estimated at US$300 -500 million annually. 

12.      The improving fiscal trends reflect a wide range of measures taken by the 
government.  The multi-donor GEMAP has provided significant external support for reform of 
public financial management.  The government has taken measures to improve tax and customs 
administration.  It has improved the budget preparation process and implemented an interim 
commitment control system to ensure that spending does not exceed available revenues and that 
procurement practices keep to new public procurement guidelines.  Given the relatively large 

4

 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
domestic revenue base, a major challenge for the government in the medium term will be to 
manage its spending in ways that maximize value for money, combat corruption, and benefit the 
poor. 

13.      As Liberia makes the transition from post-conflict recovery to laying the 
foundations for long-term development, a stable macroeconomic environment will be 
critical to the achievement of rapid, inclusive and sustainable growth.  The Government ’s 
macroeconomic framework would be anchored on sound fiscal, monetary, trade and exchange 
policies to foster competition, maintain price stability and encourage private sector investment to 
provide a foundation for rapid and sustained growth to increase employment and reduce poverty.   

14.      The Government’s macroeconomic framework projects GDP growth to average 7.6 
percent per annum for the 2009-2011 period down from the average of 14.3 percent per 
annum projected prior to the global economic slowdown. Growth is expected to be driven 
largely by new investments in key sectors including mining, rubber (substantial replanting) and 
infrastructure (rebuilding of roads). The global economic slowdown has resulted in lower 
primary commodity prices with adverse effects on planned investments in related sectors.  The 
lower price for logs may also result in delay in some of the start-up from the concessions that the 
government has recently signed. Overall investment in 2009 is therefore expected to be lower 
than planned, contributing to slower growth. The growth projection for 2009 is 4.9 percent, down 
from 7.1 percent in 2008 and significantly below the original projection of 14.3 percent. As 
primary commodity prices improve and the production from the forestry and iron ore industry 
increase and export agriculture improves, GDP growth is expected to rise to about 7.5 percent in 
2010 and further to 10.3 percent in 2011 as the global economy recovers. The authorities intend 
to reduce inflation from nearly 12 percent in 2007 to single digit in 2009-2011. Inflation (end of 
period), which was 9.4 percent in 2008 as a result of higher food and fuel prices, is expected to 
moderate to about 4 percent in 2009 largely as a result of the sharp decrease in food and fuel 
prices. The inflation rate is expected to moderate at around 5 percent in 2010 and 2011. A 
protracted global economic slowdown beyond 2010 with attendant lower primary commodity 
prices, further fall-off in remittances and a possible slowdown in donor support could have 
substantial adverse consequences for Liberia. A low case scenario could see GDP growth falling 
below 4 percent for 2009 and 2010 with adverse fiscal and balance of payments consequences.     

15.      Macroeconomic stability is expected to be supported by prudent fiscal policy. The 
Government is committed to maintaining a balanced cash-based budget for most of the PRS 
period in order to maintain macroeconomic stability and maximize the fiscal space for the 
implementation of the PRS. On the revenue side, the Government will continue its efforts to 
broaden the tax base through tax policy reforms and modernization of domestic tax and customs 
administration. The Government is also making efforts to maximize access to grants and to 
encourage donors (including through initiatives to improve PFM) to increasingly channel grants 
through the government’s budget. The Government therefore expects to raise revenues as a share 
of GDP from an estimated 26.3 percent in 2007/08 to 30.5 percent in 2008/09 and to 33.3 percent 
by 2010/11. On the expenditure side, the Government intends to improve the efficiency, quality 
and transparency of public expenditure while keeping spending to the limits of revenues. The 

5

 
improvement on the expenditure side should come from inter alia new PFM legislation, 
improvement in budget preparation, executing, reporting and auditing as well as improvement in 
procurement planning and implementation. The fiscal policy framework envisages a small fiscal 
deficit of 2.3 percent of GDP (on a cash basis after grants) in 2008/09 largely reflecting the lower 
revenues as a result of the external shock to the economy as well as a result of the resumption of 
debt service. The fiscal balance is expected to revert to a small surplus of 0.3 percent in 2009/10. 
A small deficit of less than 1 percent of GDP is projected for 2010/11. A reduction in fiscal 
revenues from the slower growth below 6 percent could force the Government to eliminate its 
already anemic capital spending and cut the already meager social spending on health and 
education, given its inability to borrow to sustain such expenditures.   

16.      The 2008/09 budget, which was approved by the Parliament on August 5, 2008, 
continues the vein of a cash-balanced budget with zero borrowing.  The “core budget” 
targets spending of US$265.3 million (excluding amortization) to be financed by projected 
revenues of US$249.2 million leaving a gap to be finance by a drawdown of the Government’s 
accumulated balances at the central bank.  It is estimated that about 20 percent of the revenues 
will come from payments from the mining and forestry concessions as well as from the surplus 
of state-owned enterprises.  The budget also consists of a “contingent budget” of US$27.9 
million, to be financed from revenues, which the government considers less certain, including 
payments from concessions which are currently being tendered.   

17.      The monetary policies envisaged under the macroeconomic framework of the PRS 
are expected to contribute to macroeconomic stability by reducing inflationary pressures 
and keeping the exchange rate stable. In the latter regard, the primary tool for the central bank 
is the foreign exchange auction. To enhance the monetary policy framework, the central bank 
will continue to strengthen the policy tools to manage liquidity and exchange rate stability. The 
Government intends to build on its success in strengthening the domestic banking system as 
evidenced by the strong increase in the minimum capital requirements and the capital adequacy 
ratio7 of the banking system, the system for regular on-and-off site inspection of banks and the 
publication of a list of banks licensed to operate in Liberia. The recent assessment from the IMF 
suggests that with the strengthening of the banking and the limited integration with the global 
financial system the risk of capital outflow is not significant. The Government recognizes the 
limited scope for exchange rate policy in the currently highly dollarized environment in Liberia. 
However, the IMF has assessed that Liberia’s real effective exchange rate (REER) does not 
appear to be out of line with fundamentals and have been relatively stable since 2003. The IMF 
has also advised that initiatives to strengthen the demand for Liberian dollar should be market 
based and that the Central Bank of Liberia should not attempt to target a specific level for the 
exchange rate.  

18.      Liberia is an open import/export dependent economy and so policies affecting its 
trade and balance of payments are an integral part of its overall macroeconomic policy 

7 The Liberia Central Bank increased the required minimum capital from US$2 million to US$6 million by 
December 2008, to US$8 million by December 2009, and to US$10 million by December 2010; the capital 
adequacy ratio has been raised from 8 percent to 10 percent since December 2008.

framework. The external current account deficit is expected to widen in the short term as 
exports and remittances falter in 2009 in the face of rising imports to fuel reconstruction need. 
The current account deficit is expected to show only marginal improvements in the medium term 
as export-led growth recovers, driven by the recovery in mining, forestry and the export crop 
sector including cocoa and oil palm. Based on these developments and the expected reduction in 
debt service payments after HIPC completion point, the government expects its external current 
account position to deteriorate from a deficit of 39.4 percent of GDP in 2009 (a much higher 
deficit than the 35.5 percent projected before the global slowdown) to a  higher deficit of 59.9 
percent of GDP in 2010 before improving to a deficit of 49.6 percent of GDP in 2011-also much 
higher that the original projected deficit of 19 percent of GDP. The current deficit is expected to 
be fully financed by official transfers and foreign direct investments. Nevertheless, Liberia 
would continue to require large amount of grant financing for the implementation of the PRS and 
to ensure stability in its external accounts. A protracted global slowdown beyond 2010 with 
lower commodity prices, a further reduction in remittances and possibly lower aid flows could 
possibly result in a widening of the current account deficit, possibly beyond what could be fully 
finance by foreign direct investment and transfers and thereby putting pressure on the limited 
reserves of the central bank.  

19.      In summary, Liberia’s macroeconomic framework, which forms the basis for its 
PRGF support from the IMF, provides an adequate basis for the proposed strategy.  The 
Government has generally demonstrated a satisfactory track record in maintaining prudent 
macroeconomic policies that are sustainable over the medium term. However, this framework is 
subject to significant domestic risks (security and political) as well as external shocks including 
that from the recent financial crisis and the ensuing global economic slowdown.  The adverse 
effects of the global slowdown could be substantial if the slowdown is protracted beyond 2010. 

20.      Several factors make Liberia particularly vulnerable to the downturn in the global 
economy that has followed the significant shock to financial markets.  These include:  (i) 
lower demand and consequently lower prices for primary exports;  (ii) lower remittance inflows 
for poor households;  (iii) reduction in foreign direct investment, possibly resulting in the delay 
of investment projects;  (iv) difficulty in importing food and fuel, due to the lack of trade 
finance; and (v) difficulty in closing the financing gap on the Poverty Reduction Strategy, due to 
a decrease in official aid. 

21.      The depth and duration of the global slowdown are uncertain, and Liberia’s best 
response is to maintain its strong reform agenda and continued fiscal prudence.  Continued 
strong collaboration between the government and its development partners will be paramount.  
There may also be a need to strengthen the regional dialogue, to mitigate an increased threat of 
hostility.

Box 1: Sources of Vulnerability and Opportunity in Liberia 

Strengths 
• Relatively strong fiscal position; Liberia 
operates a balanced cash budget and its 
budget control system is improving. 
• Liberia has not contracted any new debt in 
recent years, and its existing external debt 
burden will be largely forgiven once HIPC 
completion point is reached. 
• Banking system is relatively resilient to 
shocks as it is well capitalized and has 
high loan-loss provisions. 
• Budget surplus in the last few years has 
resulted in the build-up of some reserves. 
• A good track record of reforms, and a 
strong medium-term framework embodied 
in the PRSP, makes Liberia a priority 
candidate for ODA flows. 
Opportunities 
• Liberia has both the labor supply and the 
arable land to provide a significant 
response by increasing its food supply, 
thereby reducing import demand while 
providing the basis for a vibrant agro-
industry. 

Weaknesses 
• High poverty incidence. 
• Large current account deficit, driven by 
import needs for reconstruction in the face 
of slower than expected growth in exports. 
• High dependence on trade taxes. 
• Fragile though improving security situation 
significantly increases the risk premium 
that would be attached to higher cost 
capital as a result of the financial crisis. 
• Weak business environment is a 
disincentive for foreign investors 
• Economy is undiversified and industrial 
sector is extremely small. 
• Weak governance and institutions hinder 
donor and investor confidence. 

Threats 
• A reduction in foreign capital inflows 
(remittances, investment, ODA) could 
increase poverty and affect Liberia ’s 
development prospects. 
• A disruption in trade financing could cause 
food and fuel shortages on the Liberian 
market. 
• Higher economic volatility could increase 
the risks of renewed conflict in the sub-
region. 
• A reduction in investment in forestry, 
agriculture, and mining could reduce fiscal 
revenues. 

C. Debt  

22.      Liberia has made substantial progress in resolving its debt but challenges remain.  
The stock of external debt was provisionally estimated at about US$4.7 billion at end-June 2007, 
almost evenly split among multilateral, bilateral, and commercial creditors (Table 2).

23.      Liberia reached the Decision Point under the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor 
Countries (HIPC) initiative in March 2008, as a result of clearing its arrears to the World 
Bank and ADB in December 2007, and those to the IMF in March 2008.  Reaching this point 
enables the government to benefit from interim relief under the HIPC initiative.  As a result of 
the clearance of the arrears, Liberia’s total debt stock is estimated at about US$3.1 billion at end-
2008. Steps still need to be taken to reach the HIPC Completion Point. Box 2 shows where 
Liberia now stands with regard to these requirements. 

24.       Looking ahead, the achievement of a robust external debt position will depend on 
real GDP growth and on export and revenue performance as well as on prudent debt 
management.  The Liberian government has already reached agreement with its Paris Club 
creditors.  In December 2008, the government began good-faith negotiations with its commercial 
creditors,8 and a debt purchase offer was launched in January 2009 with the intent of 
extinguishing a significant portion of the debt owed to commercial creditors. The debt purchase 
is being supported by a grant under the World Bank ’s Debt Reduction Facility with support from 
donors; including Germany, Norway, the United Kingdom and the United States. 

8 This effort is supported by a technical assistance grant under the Bank’s Debt Reduction Facility (DRF).

25.       The low-income country debt sustainability analysis (LIC DSA) baseline scenario —
which assumes full delivery of traditional debt relief—reveals that Liberia is in debt 
distress, emphasizing the need for debt relief.  Under the alternative LIC DSA scenario—
which assumes full delivery of debt relief from HIPC, the Multilateral Debt Reduction Initiative 
(MDRI), and IMF beyond-HIPC9 at completion point—Liberia’s debt dynamics remain 
manageable, assuming moderate new borrowing, largely on concessional terms, and robust GDP 
growth.  (See Annex 14 for detailed debt sustainability analysis).   A preliminary update of the 
DSA (February 2009) shows an improvement in the long-run outlook relative to the decision 
point. The short-term projections for the NPV of debt-to-GDP and exports ratios have worsened, 
largely reflecting the impact of the financial crisis and the global slowdown on the prospects for 
GDP growth and exports in the short-term. However, increased interest in iron ore mining and 
commercial timber operations have led to improved prospects for growth and exports in the 
longer-term as the global economy improves. 

D. Poverty Profile 

26.      Liberia is one of the world ’s poorest countries.  Current per capita GDP is estimated at 
US$190.10 Close to two thirds of the population lives below the national poverty line, and close 
to half of the population lives in extreme poverty (Table 3).11 Poverty is more prevalent in rural 
areas (where 68 percent of the people are in poverty and 56 percent in extreme poverty) than it is 
in towns and cities (where 55 percent of the people are in poverty and 29 percent in extreme 
poverty).  Poverty shows itself in both low income and poor access to social services, resulting in 
poor health and education status.

27.      Life expectancy at birth is estimated at 45 years—below the average even for most 
fragile states.  Preventable diseases such as malaria, diarrhea, respiratory infections, and measles 
are rife.  Malnutrition is considered a key factor in high death rates, and 19 percent of children 
under five are underweight and 39 percent are stunted.  Access to quality health services remains

will be contracted after the end-2004 MDRI cutoff date.  “Beyond-HIPC ” debt relief refers to the assistance 
necessary to reduce the value of the stock of qualifying debt to zero.

low.  About half the population lacks access to safe water, and more than 60 percent have no 
access to improved sanitation facilities.12 An estimated 86 percent of the population was 
displaced during the civil war, and many have chosen not to return to their original communities 
but to remain in overcrowded and unsanitary slums, particularly in and around Monrovia.  
Access to education and training is limited, and net primary school enrollment is low, at 37 
percent.  

28.      Women in Liberia remain disproportionately affected by poverty.  They have fewer 
opportunities for education and employment, and suffer gender-based discrimination and 
violence.  In particular, non-income dimensions of poverty affect women disproportionately.  
These include high fertility rates (5.2 children per woman and 6.2 children per woman in rural 
areas), high maternal mortality (between 774 and 994 deaths for 100,000 live births in 2000), 
high illiteracy (59 percent of women illiterate compared to 37.4 percent of men), and low access 
to education.  And while Liberian women are very active in the labor market, their work is 
concentrated in the informal sector and may not put them on a sustained path of poverty 
reduction.  

29.      The causes of poor living conditions are rooted in pre-war inequities.  As noted, 
Liberia’s pre-war growth was concentrated in industrial mining and plantation production and 
highly inequitable.  State resources were concentrated in Monrovia, and most infrastructure and 
basic services benefited only urban residents. 

30.      Liberia is unlikely to meet most of the Millennium Development Goals despite the 
country ’s commitment to achieve progress in them.  The government projects a reduction in 
poverty “that is at least consistent with the spirit of the MDGs”.  It also expects that several sub-
targets can be met.   

31.      Reliable poverty statistics for Liberia are difficult to come by, but the government is 
committed to producing basic social data over the three-year duration of the Poverty 
Reduction Strategy.  The Core Welfare Indicator Questionnaire and the Demographic and 
Health Survey in 2007 provided considerable new data that helped to inform the PRS.  In 
addition, a Comprehensive Food Security and Nutrition Survey in 2006 provided baseline data 
on food security and consumption.  A national census was undertaken in March 2008.  

32.      The global economic slowdown is likely to hit the poorest the hardest.  Liberia and its 
development partners need to focus on ensuring that the nearly two million people living below 
the national poverty line are afforded basic protection, that their livelihoods are sustained, and 
that their opportunities to enter the country’s fledgling formal labor market continue to expand.

III. COUNTRY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AND ISSUES 

A. Country Priorities and Agenda 

33.      Liberia’s first full Poverty Reduction Strategy sets out the government’s priority 
agenda for April 2008 to June 2011.  The PRS is based on the following four pillars that 
represent the core strategic areas of intervention: Peace and Security, Economic Revitalization, 
Governance and the Rule of Law, and Infrastructure and Basic Services.  In addition, the PRS 
pursues a number of priority crosscutting themes, including gender equity, peace-building, 
environmental issues, HIV and AIDS, and children and youth.   

• Peace and Security.   The main objective is “to create a secure and peaceful environment, 
both domestically and in the sub-region, that is conducive to sustainable, inclusive, and 
equitable growth and development.” Government aims to rebuild national security 
institutions capable of assuming authority as the international peacekeeping force is 
drawn down.  Emphasis is placed on reforming security institutions and training soldiers, 
police officers, and other personnel in the security sector, as well as building public 
confidence in the government’s ability to maintain peace and security.  

• Economic Revitalization.   The main objective is “to firmly establish a stable and secure 
environment and to be on an irreversible path towards rapid, inclusive, and sustainable 
growth and development.” Growth will be led by the private sector, while the 
government will focus on reforming public institutions and processes in order to facilitate 
investment and strengthen market functions.  Emphasis is placed on agriculture, as well 
as the traditional growth sectors of forestry and mining.  

• Strengthening Governance and Rule of Law.  The main objective is “to work in 
partnership with all citizens to build and operate effective institutions and systems that 
will strengthen peace and promote and uphold democratic governance, accountability, 
and justice for all.” The government plans to develop a decentralization policy, work to 
curb corruption, reach out to civil society, and undertake public sector reform, including 
civil service and judicial reform. 

• 

Infrastructure and Basic Services.  The main objective is “to embark on the rehabilitation 
of infrastructure and the rebuilding of systems to deliver basic services in order to create 
the conditions and linkages needed to achieve broad-based growth and poverty 
reduction”. 
 Priority areas identified through stakeholder consultations are the 
rehabilitation of roads, water supply, and sanitation, as well as improvements in health 
and educational services. 
 Main priorities include: roads and bridges, energy 
infrastructure, transport facilities, and water and sanitation systems, financed over time 
with significant private sector participation.  

13

 
 
 
B. Structural and Sectoral Development and Challenges 

Infrastructure 

34.      Rehabilitation of infrastructure remains Liberia’s greatest post-war challenge.  
During the war the extensive destruction of basic infrastructure, coupled with lack of 
maintenance, contributed to the collapse of productive activities and a reversion essentially 
to a subsistence economy.  The transport infrastructure base needs to be rebuilt: most of the 
country’s 10,000 km of existing roads are in extre me disrepair, and often impassable during the 
rainy season, and the airport and seaport are dilapidated and poorly organized, severely 
hampering international commerce.  There is very little electricity generation.  Urban 
infrastructure requires significant investments.  Major public services were discontinued during 
the war and need to be reestablished, including solid waste collection and the development of a 
landfill, and restoration of water and sewerage facilities.  Needs for information and 
communications technology are enormous.  

35.      Clearly, Liberia’s 
infrastructure needs far outweigh available funds and 
implementation capacity.  Part of the solution will be to seek regional collaborative approaches 
that can lower costs, such as those used by the West African Power Pool, or to take advantage of 
private sector investments, such as roads developed by mining companies; or to structure public-
private partnerships, such as in urban water supply in other West African countries.  The PRS 
sets out a prioritized program of interventions, targeting selected activities in transport, energy, 
water, and sanitation leading to the development of long-term sector strategies.  

Agriculture and natural resources 

36.      Agriculture.  Agriculture is Liberia’s main source of livelihood and employs 70 percent 
of the people who have jobs.  Recovery from conflict has been quicker in the commercial 
plantation sector, where high world prices for rubber and palm oil have spurred investment.  But 
ensuring balanced growth in agriculture will be critical for sustained peace.  Most of the 
country’s households reverted to subsistence farming during the war, and the challenge now is to 
boost their marketable surplus.  The major needs for revitalizing agriculture, as recognized in the 
PRS, are:  to increase yields and production in key cash and export crops from both the 
smallholder and commercial/plantation sectors; to support improved value chains, including 
more efficient supply chains and more opportunity for value addition and off-farm employment; 
to enhance food security by stimulating food crop production; and to build the capacity of the 
Ministry of Agriculture and other institutions to plan and monitor outcomes in the sector.13 This 
includes the need to ensure that women— who make up more than half the people engaged in 
agriculture —
obtain equal access to resources, training, and services.  Reforming Liberia’s 
outdated dual land tenure system—formal and customary—will also play a major part in 
boosting agriculture.  

13 These needs were identified by the Comprehensive Agricultural Assessment and Strategy (CAAS-Lib), supported 
by FAO and the World Bank.

37.      Mining.  Though most commercial mining activities ceased during the civil war, the 
mining sector has a large potential for rapid growth and poverty reduction in the medium to long 
term.  Large-scale iron mining has historically been one of Liberia ’s main sources of growth 
(four large iron-ore concessions contributed about 25 percent of GDP and 64 percent of exports 
in the mid-1970s), and a significant artisanal and small-scale mining sector, mainly in diamonds 
and gold, employs an estimated 100,000 people.  Since 2006, the government has shown a 
commitment to reforming the mineral sector.  It has reviewed and renegotiated concessions that 
were signed during the National Transitional Government period, launched the Kimberly Process 
in 2007, and worked towards a revision of the legal and policy framework for mining—through 
the development of a draft Mineral Policy and a draft model Mineral Development Agreement, 
with draft fiscal terms and conditions for mining and petroleum to be incorporated into 
legislation.  Liberia has also made progress towards implementing the Extractive Industries 
Transparency Initiative (EITI).14 Liberia quickly reached EITI candidacy stage and is currently 
working towards producing its first EITI report.  The ADB and the World Bank are collaborating 
to help the government implement the Initiative.  

38.      Forestry.  Historically, efforts to convert Liberia’s natural forest capital into monetized 
growth have led to growth without development: the so-called “resource curse ”.  Liberia lies at 
the heart of the Upper Guinea Forest Biodiversity Hotspot, which is one of 35 such critical areas 
worldwide for biodiversity conservation.  Forests in this region have been reduced to an 
estimated 14 percent of their original extent, with Liberia retaining 43 percent of what remains.  
Thus Liberia’s actions will be critical to succe ssful conservation in the region.  The government 
has decided to include the forestry sector, in addition to mining and petroleum, in EITI (see 
previous paragraph), and the PRSP and the new Forestry Law reflect a consensus strategy for 
more balanced and integrated development of the country’s forests.  Putting the strategy into 
practice will require conservation measures (also as a means of carbon storage) and sustainable 
management of the forest and secondary processing of forest products, so that forestry can make 
a lasting contribution to economic growth.  As well as respecting environmental considerations, 
the challenge is to encourage pro-poor growth based on: (i) sharing with communities the 
benefits of revenues from commercial concessions; (ii) providing opportunities for meaningful 
participation in value-chains; and (iii) sharing equity in productive forest resources.  Given the 
direction of policy and legislation towards recognition of community rights on forest lands, there 
is also an emerging need to avoid land-use conflict by developing opportunities for synergy 
between small-scale producers and commercial companies. 

Human Development 

39.      Improving human development outcomes remains a daunting challenge.  Since the 
end of the war, the government has sought to improve basic education and health.  Ultimately, 
Liberia will need to balance short-term needs in health, education, and social protection, using a 
consolidated approach to delivering basic human services and a long-term strategy towards 
social protection and risk management.  

14 This global initiative supports improved governance in resource-rich countries through the verification and full 
publication of company payments and government revenues from oil, gas, and mining.

40.      Education.  Wide disparities exist in enrollment, dropout, and survival rates by economic 
status, gender, and location.  Education is provided by a combination of private, church-owned, 
community-based, and public schools with little government oversight.  A rise in the gross 
primary enrollment rate to a relatively high 87 percent suggests that older children who missed 
being educated during the war are returning to school.  Most of the children in school are older 
than the intended age range for the grade they are attending and schools remain overcrowded.  
Dropout rates are high and less than one in five children proceeds to secondary school.  The 
government’s recently introduced Primary Education Recovery Program (LPERP) is the initial 
step towards a full sector plan and setting up an administrative and financing framework.  It aims 
to improve the organization and management of physical and human resources, curriculum, and 
teaching programs, and to supervise the quality of teaching and learning in both public and 
private schools. 

41.      Health.  Filling gaps left by wartime relief agencies is critical to avoid a collapse of the 
health sector.  For example, fewer than 170 doctors are now practicing in this country of more 
than 3 million people.  The government’s newly formed National Health Policy calls for a two-
pronged approach: (i) strengthening the delivery and management of an equitable, effective, 
efficient, responsive, and sustainable health care system; and (ii) securing and expanding access 
to basic health care of acceptable quality.   

42.      Social Protection is fragmented and under-resourced.  Since the conflict ended, the 
social protection agenda has been driven by a series of often-uncoordinated activities financed by 
donors and executed mainly by international NGOs.  Without structured policies for social 
protection, a community-based approach to managing risks and protecting the most vulnerable 
people remains viable in the short run.  Priorities at the community level include provision of 
basic services; food security measures (including community-based agro-processing); and efforts 
to create jobs and means of livelihood.   Over the longer term, the government will need to 
develop a social protection strategy that integrates local government, community development, 
and protection for the poorest and most vulnerable populations and that adequately addresses the 
different sources of vulnerability of various population groups.15  

Private Sector Development 

43.      Private sector growth, if equitable, is poised to be the main engine of Liberia ’s post-
war recovery.  To achieve growth and create jobs on the broad scale that is needed, a dynamic 
small and medium enterprise sector will be essential.  At present, however, entrepreneurship is 
weak in Liberia.  Except for a few major companies such as Arcelor Mittal and Firestone, most 
businesses are small and informal, with low production capacity.  There are no reliable business 
support services.  The most prevalent SME support institutions are public institutions with mixed 
track records, a weak skills/knowledge base, dependence on government funding, and limited 

15 For example, a recent World Bank assessment underscores the complexity and multiplicity of risks that certain 
groups, such as adolescent girls, face in Liberia, making them a priority group of poor people that a social protection 
strategy should target.  See Ruiz Abril, M.E., “Gir ls ’ Vulnerability Assessment, background report for the 
preparation of the Women ’s and Adolescent Girls Econom ic Empowerment Project, ” June 2008.  World Bank: 
Monrovia.   

16

 
                                                 
potential for efficient operations.  Poor infrastructure (energy, roads, and telecommunications) 
compounds the difficulties.  

44.      Important aspects of a basic financial infrastructure, such as market instruments 
for the conduct of monetary policy and an interbank payment system, have yet to be 
established.  The legal and regulatory framework for collateralized lending needs to be 
developed and the legal framework to facilitate the collection of debts and enforcement of 
financial contracts need strengthening.  Overall confidence in the financial system could be 
enhanced by building the capacity of the Central Bank for regulation and supervision and by 
developing processes for sharing information on creditworthiness.  The market for long-term 
capital is yet to be developed and there are no effective vehicles for contractual savings and 
collective investment aside from the National Social Security and Welfare Corporation.   

45.      Despite the challenges, the government is committed to private sector-led growth.  
This focuses particularly on the enabling environment for the private sector, including 
macroeconomic stability, tax and tariff reforms, a clear legislative framework, and transparency 
in business dealings.  Between 2007 and 2008, a number of reforms made starting a business and 
starting a construction project faster and easier, facilitated access to credit, and encouraged cross-
border trade.  On the ease of doing business, Liberia was ranked 157 out of 181 economies in 
2008, up from 170 out of 178 the previous year.16  

46.      IFC has been assisting with private sector development and investment climate 
issues that affect private sector growth and access to finance, including through trade 
finance lines and equity, debt and technical assistance in the development of a commercial 
microfinance bank.  The African Development Bank, through its private sector window and in 
collaboration with IFC and other partners, is providing equity and technical assistance support to 
the financial services sector with a view to providing finance to micro, small, and medium-size 
clients in Liberia. To further strengthen the investment climate, Liberia will need assistance to 
develop the financial sector; streamline the regulatory framework for businesses; continue its tax 
reform efforts, including alignment with the ECOWAS Common External Tariff; and invest in 
infrastructure, including roads, port facilities, telecommunications, and energy provision.  In 
addition, regional issues loom large, given Liberia ’s small economy and the existence of cross-
border issues including security, energy, agricultural trade, and common natural resources such 
as fisheries. 

C. Governance and Anti-Corruption Efforts 

47.      Addressing weak governance structures and building effective and efficient public 
institutions is a significant challenge facing Liberia's development, including advancing the 
Public Sector Reform agenda.  Areas with particularly weak capacity include: (i) the Civil 
Service Agency;  (ii) the public financial management system;  (iii) the Judicial Training 
Institute, and (iv) the Governance Commission.  Decentralizing power and engaging citizen 
participation are also at the forefront of governance related concerns, including building local 

16 Doing Business Report 2008 and 2009. 

17

 
                                                 
capacity and effective links between the Central Government and Counties and Districts.   
Liberia also seeks to establish better inter-ministry relations through a "joined-up government" as 
well as enhance the coordination between the Executive branch, Legislature and Judiciary.  With 
regard to anticorruption efforts, Liberia needs to build national integrity system and oversight 
mechanisms and actually implement anticorruption strategies throughout the state (i.e. 
embedding the Anticorruption strategy at all levels). 

Public Sector Reform 

48.      Civil Service Reform.  Some progress has been made in reforming the dysfunctional and 
bloated civil service that the new government inherited after the war.  The government has 
developed a civil service reform strategy.  Some of the salary arrears to public servants have 
been cleared and there have been three modest increases in basic pay (though salaries remain 
very low and highly compressed).  A large number of ghosts have been eliminated from the civil 
service payroll, which is now down from 42,000 to 35,000.  The Liberia Institute of Public 
Administration is now operating in rehabilitated premises, a Senior Executive Service has been 
launched, and several ministries have begun their own restructuring programs.  A remaining 
challenge is to narrow the gender gaps in the civil service; only about one in five public sector 
employees are women.17   

49.      Rule of law is one of the main pillars of the Government ’s PRSP, but it remains one of 
the weakest areas of state capacity.  The justice system--from investigation to prosecution and 
sanction or enforcement of judgments--is plagued by corruption and inadequate capacity and 
impunity is too often the norm rather than the exception.  The functions of the national police are 
not clearly defined (vis- à-vis military police), and there is a serious imbalance between 
prosecutors and public defense.  Judges are poorly trained, numerous magistrates are not law 
school graduates, and courtrooms are not functioning.  Key areas in the PRSP include:  (i) 
expanding access to justice;  (ii) strengthening and promoting human rights;  (iii) reviewing laws 
and the constitution;  (iv) integrating and enhancing traditional justice systems;  and (v) 
delivering justice to especially vulnerable groups.  In addition, a major World Bank analytic 
piece on land reform indicates the need for urgently working to catalog and administer existing 
land records, build capacity to put a land tenure system in place, and develop a transparent 
system by which land disputes can be adjudicated. 

Public Financial Management 

50.      Economic governance issues have been a key driver of conflict in Liberia and vested 
interests remain entrenched in the public sector.  Robust diagnostics of the quality of 
governance are scarce, but the 2006 Global Integrity Report18 rated Liberia as “very weak” on 
four of six indicators.  Liberia continues to score poorly on Transparency International’s 
Corruption Perception Index (2.1 out of 10 in 2007).

Civil Service.  Monrovia: LISGIS.

51.      However, progress made since 2006 is commendable.  The World Bank Institute’s 
most recent Worldwide Governance Indicators reflects a strong improvement in Liberia’s index 
of “control of corruption”.  Liberia adopted 
(in December 2006) a national anti-corruption policy 
and strategic framework, and has passed a law for the creation of an Anti-Corruption 
Commission with prosecutorial powers.  The World Bank’s most recent Post-Conflict 
Performance Indicators rated Liberia 3.3 (on a six-point scale) on public sector management and 
institutional performance, up from 2.3 the previous year.  Similarly, Liberia showed an 
improvement in public sector management and institutional performance under the African 
Development Bank ’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment, from 3.4 in 2006 to 3.5 in 
2007.  

52.      Financial management reforms in particular show that the current government is 
firmly committed to governance reform over the long term.  As described in Chapter II 
above, the government has put cash management controls in place, maintained a balanced cash-
based budget, and restored transparency to the budget process.  It achieved most of its objectives 
under two IMF staff-monitored programs, which focused on strengthening public financial 
management and the domestic financial sector and implementing anticorruption and domestic 
debt resolution strategies.  It has also introduced regular fiscal reporting, enacted and 
implemented a new procurement law, and introduced better financial controls in key state-owned 
enterprises.  

53.      Further work on public financial management is needed, including making the 
budget more effective.  A public expenditure management and financial accountability review 
(PEMFAR) undertaken by the World Bank, ADB, and IMF proposes a framework for further 
reforming PFM and procurement, building robust audit functions, and anti-corruption measures.  
Success under these reforms will form the basis for phasing out the GEMAP during the CAS 
period (by the HIPC completion point in 2010).  Next steps also include work on fiscal 
deconcentration and building demand-side accountability on governance. 

54.      As the government’s structures and implementation capacity for public financial 
management improve, donors’ scope increases for channeling their aid through Liberia’s budget.  
Direct budget support allows governments to more easily forecast aid inflows, aligns aid 
resources to their  policy priorities, and pursues more economically efficient and scaled-up 
solutions to problems.  Only a small part of the aid to Liberia takes the form of budget support at 
present.  To provide increased assurance to donors, the government will need to continue its 
PFM reforms and sustain its strong performance under the Poverty Reduction and Growth 
Facility, so as to show it can effectively use increased donor resources through the budget.  

D. Cross-Cutting and Other Issues 

Capacity Building 

55.      Capacity is the binding constraint on Liberia ’s reconstruction and development.  
The widespread brain drain that took place during the civil war left the country largely 
bereft of skilled people, hampering reconstruction and reform efforts at all levels.  

19

 
Ministries lack capacity to implement development projects, and the private sector finds it 
difficult to recruit qualified people. Should employment opportunities pick up in the private 
business sector there is a risk that few qualified applicants will be available.  Capacity building 
needs to be pursued in every sector at all levels, including by rebuilding the technical skills base, 
building implementation capacity, rebuilding state administrative capacity, and addressing the 
environment and incentives that make for effective capacity development.  Over the longer term 
Liberia will need to address its critical shortage of training organizations, whether by reviving 
some that existed before the war or by establishing new ones, such as a school for training in 
project management, financial management, and monitoring and evaluation. 

56.      Under the PRS, the government is tackling the need to build capacity on several 
fronts.  These include: a Senior Executive Service program to get qualified Liberians into the 
management levels of the civil service; revitalization of the Liberian Institute for Public 
Administration to train mid-level civil servants; a Financial Management Training School to 
train certified financial accountants to staff key ministries; and the Ministry of Finance’s 
accelerated education programs for young adults, among other measures.  It is working to build 
public implementation capacity for large infrastructure projects, and is taking steps to encourage 
private sector development.  There is also a need to address the dire shortage of skills required in 
the private sector. For the medium term, the government is working on a capacity development 
plan to address critical needs across all of these areas.  

Gender Issues 

57.      Though significant legislative and policy advances have been made since the end of 
the war, women still lack access to productive resources and to equal opportunities and 
participation in management and decision making at all levels of society.  Their participation 
in political leadership and decision making remains low, with only 14 percent representation in 
the legislature (2007), 0.8 percent in the judiciary (2005), 5.3 percent in government bureaus and 
agencies (2005), and 10.3 percent in ministries (2005).  Most important, gender-based violence is 
a serious problem in Liberia affecting women ’s a nd girls’ ability to lead a safe life (PRSP, 2008).  
Domestic violence is endemic, and rape remained the most reported crime in Liberia in 2006.  
Gender issues will require a strong policy response in the next few years, and, in the context of 
limited capacity, strengthening the government’s ability to undertake gender-aware policy 
formulation will be essential.  

Trade Development 

58.      The development of trade and export-led growth is critical to Liberia’s recovery .  
Much of the country’s export base was eroded during the war, as noted earlier, so that the main 
exports today are rubber and scrap metal.  Liberia has large potential for growth in mining, 
agriculture (particularly in tree-crops such as rubber, oil palm, and cocoa), fisheries, and forest 
products, but a prudent policy framework must be put in place to ensure that growth is equitable 
and sustainable, and that it is environmentally responsible.  Basic elements of the needed 
framework include concession agreements that secure a fair share of the rents for government, 
prudent management of tax revenues and royalties, an improved investment climate, and market-
20

 
friendly approaches to promote employment of poor people, including women in largely male-
dominated export sectors.19  

Environmental sustainability 

59.      Liberia retains an important area of the endangered Guinean Forest Ecosystem,  
and its coastal waters and uplands are rich sources of biodiversity.  Its abundant natural 
resources have enormous economic potential, making the sustainability of these resources a 
primary issue for the government.  At the same time, Liberia also faces potential natural disasters 
from climate-related hazards, including floods, landslides, excessively high temperatures, 
drought, windstorms, and coastal erosion following sea level rise.  Data are insufficient either to 
establish a baseline or to assess whether Liberia will meet the MDG on environmental 
sustainability.  At the same time, the government ’s capacity to monitor progress is weak.  The 
government is nonetheless committed to addressing environmental issues and has made some 
progress since 2003.  It has developed a National Environmental Policy and adopted two major 
environmental 
laws—the Environmental Protection and Management Law and 
the 
Environmental Protection Agency Act—as well as the new Forestry Law noted earlier.  The 
Environmental Protection Agency became fully functional in 2006.  The World Bank has carried 
out training programs in the EPA and the Forest Development Authority on environmental 
impact assessment, strategic environmental assessment, social assessment, the resettlement 
framework, process framework, and participatory strategies for infrastructure, mining, and 
forestry-related investments.   

Regional Integration 

60.      Liberia has a keen interest in regional integration, being aware that national efforts 
alone will have great difficulty achieving the rapid, inclusive, and sustainable economic 
growth that is needed.20 Its own battered economy is small, and its resources very limited.  
Better physical connectivity with neighboring countries will be critical for accessing regional and 
global markets and thereby diversifying its economy.  Additional growth opportunities could be 
unlocked through regional approaches to the management of a number of important shared 
resources (fisheries, the Mano river basin) and trans-boundary development challenges 
(conflicts, infectious diseases, and the potential negative environmental, social, and economic 
impacts of mining development).  In particular, building a stronger and more competitive 
agriculture will require collaborative efforts with neighboring countries in agricultural research 
and the dissemination of new technologies.  The potential of the mining sector for economic 
growth and poverty reduction can be more fully exploited through regional collaboration to 
harmonize regulatory frameworks and fiscal regimes; contain negative transboundary impacts; 
and develop economic clusters and networks of energy and transport infrastructure catalyzed by 
mineral investments.

that promotes jobs for low-skilled workers, and less dependency on primary products and extractive industries over 
time.

IV. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INTERIM STRATEGY AND LESSONS 
LEARNED 

61.      As Liberia moved rapidly from civil war to the founding of a functioning and 
successful state, the World Bank Group/ADB responded with an Interim Strategy for the 
period July 2007 to June 2008.  The Joint Interim Strategy Note (ISN) of June 2007 set out a 
three-pronged approach that was fully consistent with the government ’s Interim Poverty 
Reduction Strategy and focused on: (i) revitalizing the economy; (ii) strengthening governance 
and the rule of law; (iii) rehabilitating infrastructure and delivering basic services.  The 
components of the Interim Strategy were designed to help rebuild state capacity, ensure visible 
impact, and coordinate closely with the activities of other donors. 

62.      Overall implementation of the Interim Strategy has been satisfactory.  Both the 
World Bank Group and ADB have maintained a consistent engagement in Liberia, leading the 
donor community in their core areas of expertise: economic governance, community-driven 
development (World Bank only), and infrastructure rehabilitation.  Despite the significant 
constraints that are posed by lack of capacity, uneven governance, and implementation 
difficulties, the World Bank Group program has begun to deliver results.  The African 
Development Bank program introduced under the Interim Strategy is largely in place, and 
intermediate results will be tangible during the CAS period.  

63.      The ISN implementation has yielded some important lessons: 

• Respect Liberia’s limited implementation capacity.  Implementation capacity is the 
defining barrier to rapid development in Liberia.  Both the banks have found it a 
challenge to implement their existing portfolios, not only because of counterparts’ weak 
capacity for project management but also because of difficulties in attracting qualified 
bidders for works.  Though the government has a strong reformist bent, the country’s 
almost total lack of technical capacity has left much of the burden of implementation on 
bank teams.  During the ISN period, a rapid scale-up of implementation capacity in two 
Liberian agencies —the Ministry of Public Works and the Liberia Agency for Community 
Empowerment (LACE)—provided the foundation for the approval of eight World Bank 
emergency operations.  These two agencies had the most promising implementation 
capacity, but they are already overstretched and will need sustained support to keep up 
with increasing demands.  The ADB Institutional Support project, aiming to rebuild 
national capacity in the areas of good governance and economic management, was 
approved in late 2006 but did not become effective until April 2008, for lack of 
implementation capacity; thus far, it has made just one disbursement.  Out of four 
operations approved in late 2007-early 2008, only two other ADB projects have just 
recently made their first disbursements.  

• Consolidate interventions and keep to the principle of strategic selectivity.  Up to 
now, the World Bank Group has spread itself thinly in Liberia.  As one of the most active 
donors since the peace accord, it has created high expectations that far outrun its program 
resources and staff capacity.  Going forward, it must be more selective and better 
22

 
leverage a full range of resources, including those of the IFC, multi-donor trust funds, 
and co-financing with other donors.  The African Development Bank’s support since the 
peace accord has focused mainly on infrastructure and governance reform.  Consistent 
with the ADF-11 operational priorities and the Bank’s strategy for enhanced engagement 
in fragile states, ADB will continue and build on its ongoing operations and will also 
reengage in lending to Liberia ’s main productive sectors—particularly agriculture, and 
potentially mining.   

• Build capacity for portfolio management and strengthen project-level monitoring 
and evaluation.  The current Liberian portfolios of both banks are very young.  The 
World Bank’s six active IDA projects are only about one year old, on average, and 90 
percent of them are rated satisfactory thus far.  The ADB ’s five active projects have an 
average age of four months (from effectiveness date); one project is rated satisfactory 
while others have not been rated yet.  A detailed review by the World Bank of its 
portfolio M&E arrangements found weaknesses in the articulation and implementation of 
project results frameworks, ranging from unclear formulation of project development 
objectives to lack of baseline and target data.  During the CAS period, a stronger 
emphasis will be put on monitoring and evaluation to ensure that operations are on track 
to deliver expected outcomes.  The ADB is increasing its field presence through the 
Sierra Leone Field Office with a view to enhancing its portfolio management and 
capacity building efforts. 

V. WORLD BANK GROUP AND AFRICAN DEVELOPEMT BANK GROUP 
ASSISTANCE STRATEGY 

A. Principles for World Bank Group and African Development Bank Group Engagement 
in Liberia 

64.      Align with the government’s Poverty Reduction Strategy.  The overarching aim of the 
Joint Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of the World Bank Group and the ADB Group is to 
support Liberia’s transition from post-conflict recove ry to long-term development.  The strategy 
addresses some key constraints on growth as well as enhancing the policy and institutional 
framework to ensure that growth is increasingly pro-poor.  It is fully aligned with the pillars and 
objectives set out in Liberia’s PRSP.  The CAS will pursue three strategic themes: (i) rebuilding 
core state functions and institutions; (ii) rehabilitating infrastructure to jump-start economic 
growth; and (iii) facilitating pro-poor growth.  These themes are fully aligned with pillars II, III, 
and IV of the Poverty Reduction Strategy.  The CAS will also focus on the crosscutting objective 
of capacity development.  Gender and the environment are important elements of the strategy 
that will be increasingly mainstreamed into World Bank and ADB programs.   

65.      Focus on selectivity and achieving results.  The focus of the CAS is selective, given 
Liberia’s limited implementation capacity.  Most of the CAS results will be generated from 
existing projects – which spanned a wide range of sectors during the reengagement period.  New 

23

 
 
projects are carefully targeted, largely avoiding entry into new sectors.  The choice of activities 
is consistent with the comparative advantages of both banks as well as the leadership of other 
donors in certain thematic areas, and with the government’s expressed wish to focus of the bulk 
of investment finance on rebuilding transport and other infrastructure.  The two banks will work 
with government and to ensure that they are working in a harmonized and coordinated way with 
the donor community, across all PRS priorities.  

66.      Mainstream principles of good governance at both the country program and the 
operational level.  The CAS includes a strong core governance program, focusing heavily on 
helping Liberia rebuild its public financial management capacity, as well as its institutional and 
human resource capacity in the civil service.  At the operational level, the World Bank will 
continue to work to ensure that, despite enormous capacity constraints, robust fiduciary standards 
are maintained.  The CAS program incorporates the building of implementation capacity in all 
projects, as well as providing for intensive supervision and monitoring and evaluation support. 

67.      Make choices that are consistent with a regional integration perspective, given the 
government’s key interest in achieving the benefits from regional integration .  The ADB 
and other development partners are committed to supporting efforts to increase regional 
cooperation and dialogue through, for example, the World Bank’s dialogue in Liberia’s 
neighboring countries, World Bank and ADB participation in the International Contact Group for 
the Mano River Union, and the ADB ’s upcoming Regional Integration Assistance Strategy for 
West Africa.   

B. Expected Outcomes  

68.      Figure 1 illustrates the strategic themes and expected key outcomes of the Joint 
Strategy (Annex 1 shows the complete results framework). 

Theme 1: Rebuilding core state functions and institutions 

69.      The CAS will help Liberia to continue to implement a robust governance reform 
program.  The World Bank and the ADBs work focuses specifically on further strengthening the 
core public financial management system and reforming and modernizing the civil service.  This 
work is critical for rebuilding Liberia ’s shattered state institutions, ensuring that the country can 
bring manage its own resource flows transparently, bring aid on budget, and greatly increase its 
human capacity to carry out core state functions.  Much progress has been made in these areas 
over the past year under the two banks' Interim Strategy and this work will continue through the 
CAS period.

Capacity Development 

CAS Outcome 1:  Improved efficiency of budget preparation and execution and enhanced 
revenue administration 

70.      Public Financial Management.  The World Bank and the African Development Bank 
will provide continued complementary support to strengthen public financial management and 
help begin the task of fiscal deconcentration, mainly through technical assistance and policy 
based budget support operations.  The World Bank’s Economic Governance and Institutional 
Reform Project (EGIRP—US$11 million) and Development Policy Operation (US$15 million) 
will be harmonized with the ADB ’s budget support operations of an indicative amount of 
US$32.7 million (including US$4.7 million from the African Food Crisis Response).  These 
operations cover the three-year period of the CAS and focus on consolidating and extending 
existing work on public financial management and procurement reform.  Specifically, they will: 
(i) support implementation of the proposed Public Financial Management Law and regulations 
and strengthen financial management training programs; (ii) support the strengthening of 
capacity for macro-fiscal analysis (including gender analysis), budget preparation, and execution; 
(iii) provide technical assistance on public procurement reforms, including support for the Public 
Procurement and Concessions Commission and key ministries and agencies; (iv) consolidate and 
strengthen the tax and customs administration reform efforts by implementing a new 
computerized Integrated Tax Administration System and a new customs administration system; 
(v) support the training and equipping of  a new team of auditors within the General Auditing 
Commission in order to strengthen the government’s external audit function; (vi) strengthen the 
capacity of the Ways and Means Committees to ensure proper scrutiny of the execution of the 
budget; and (vii) support government’s measures to limit the social impact of rising food prices..  
These programs support the central elements of the government’s macroeconomic strategy to 

25

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
provide the foundation for rapid, inclusive, and sustainable growth. They will help the 
government apply sound policies that foster competition, maintain price stability, create 
employment opportunities, and encourage private sector investment.  In addition, analytic and 
other work will be initiated to help inform the Government’s decentralization process, which 
may include fiscal decentralization. The World Bank is working with the IMF on a fiscal 
decentralization study which will help to inform the Governments’ long term strategy in this 
area. Work will continue to build up local financial management capacity in the Ministry of 
Finance, through a variety of capacity building interventions, including the Bank-supported 
Liberia Institute for Public Administration. Finally, work will be continued to foster demand-
driven governance and accountability, particularly through continued support to the Liberia EITI 
program, which provides a platform for dialogue and capacity building of civil society groups 
such as the National Traditional Council and the Publish What You Pay Coalition, with a 
particular focus on transparency within the extractive industries area.  The World Bank will also 
explore pilot social accountability activities around some of its own projects. 

CAS Outcome 2: Increased professionalization and improved HR management of the 
civil service 

71.      Civil Service Reform.  The World Bank will continue to provide implementation 
support for the government ’s civil service reform strategy.  This is supported by three ongoing 
operations including:  (i) a LICUS Trust Fund Grant of US$900,000 focusing on analytic work 
(e.g.  development of a pay and employment strategy and organizational reviews) and capacity 
building for the Civil Service Agency and the Liberia Institute of Public Administration; (ii) a 
Trust Fund for Liberia grant of US$2.3 million supporting the Senior Executive Service, which 
aims to help fill the major capacity gap that exists in key ministries at the level immediately 
below ministers; and (iii) the Economic Governance and Institutional Reform Project which 
supports the development of a human resources and payroll module within the integrated 
financial management and information system.  These projects complement DfID ’s Civil Service 
Capacity Building program and the work of other donors, including UNDP and USAID. 

Theme 2: Rehabilitating infrastructure to jump-start economic growth 

72.      Faced with the huge investment needs in infrastructure, the government has 
indicated that its preferred use of lending from the World Bank and ADB is for roads, 
agricultural infrastructure, and water supply and sanitation.  This is due to the high priority 
of these facilities in the Poverty Reduction Strategy and difficulties in attracting investments for 
them from other sources. 

CAS Outcome 3: Improved access to key infrastructure services 

73.      Transport.  The World Bank will lead in supporting the rehabilitation of roads and 
bridges to connect critical parts of the country.  A series of emergency infrastructure programs, 
financed by IDA and the Liberia Reconstruction and Development Trust Fund—a new multi-
donor trust fund for infrastructure administered by the World Bank—will continue with a new 
program totaling US$85 million (US$53.2 million in FY09 million in FY09 and the remainder in 

26

 
 
outer years).  This will support the rehabilitation of Monrovia streets, a pilot road-resurfacing 
program that could be scaled up in future projects, and a first portion of two major roads that 
would be completed potentially under the LRTF.  The World Bank will also help develop the 
institutional capacity to manage the sector and develop the Special Implementation Unit of the 
Ministry of Public Works into a fully professional infrastructure implementation unit, the 
Infrastructure Implementation Unit, which would then be phased into a Road Authority as other 
line ministries acquire the capacity to carry out their own infrastructure projects.  Associated 
with this support would be a move towards achieving sustainable financing for routine and 
periodic maintenance of the road network through establishment of a Road Maintenance Fund.  
In line with government priorities and the widespread need for social protection, many works 
will be done using labor-intensive methods.  The World Bank support will also focus on 
improving the infrastructure and management efficiency of the Monrovia port.  The ADB ’s 
ongoing labor-based public works project will rehabilitate the Fishtown-Harper road, construct 
drainage points and bridges, and rehabilitate selected schools and health facilities.  It will also 
build capacity within the Ministry of Public Works for infrastructure maintenance using labor-
based methods.  A significant component of ADB’s proposed agricultural sector project is the 
construction and rehabilitation of rural and feeder roads, irrigation, and social infrastructure, as 
well as capacity building within the Ministry of Agriculture.  Finally, the CAS will continue 
facilitating the private-sector-led rehabilitation of the port of Monrovia —a key access point for 
Liberia’s international trade.  

74.      Water and sanitation.  The ADB will lead the CAS financial support and advisory 
services for this sector.  The interventions aim to increase the volume of water supply in 
Monrovia and some rural areas and to strengthen the responsible line ministries’ ability to take 
on these functions.  Ongoing operations consist of the ADB/DfID/WB Monrovia Water Supply 
and Sanitation Rehabilitation Program and 
the White Plains Water Treatment Plant 
Rehabilitation Project.  Under the CAS, the ADB will finance the Monrovia Expansion and 
Rehabilitation of Three County Capitals’ Water Supply and Sanitation project.  The design study 
for this project is ongoing.  The ADB’s proposed ag riculture sector project includes a significant 
water management/irrigation infrastructure component.   

75.      Energy.  CAS support for energy will concentrate on electric power supply; the World 
Bank and IFC together are supporting efforts to get electricity up and running in Monrovia and 
key rural areas.  The challenges are immense, given the low starting base, and expectations of 
results should remain modest for the CAS period.  As lead adviser to the government, the IFC 
will help select a private operator to develop, operate and manage an integrated electricity 
system for Monrovia; it will advise on the preparation, design, and implementation of a 
transparent competitive tender process for this purpose.  The type and scope of private sector 
participation in developing and financing the electricity system will be influenced by a number 
of factors, including government sector policy and decisions on market structure, transaction 
structure, and regulation; issues surrounding cost recovery, tariff levels, tariff affordability, and 
the government’s willingness to charge market tariffs; availability and level of donor grants for 
capital expenditure which would reduce the required tariff level; and the ability of private 
operators to raise necessary private financing in a downturn..  In addition, to enhance the 

27

 
understanding of key energy sector development issues and improve and inform the public 
policy, reforms and investment decision framework necessary to jump start the sector, the World 
Bank Group will carry out a study of Liberia’s energy sector in collaboration with the 
Government of Liberia and other Liberian stakeholders. To provide a comprehensive picture, the 
review will cover three key areas to be developed over the period of the CAS:  (i) development 
of the electricity sector and regional integration; (ii) the petroleum sector; and (iii) rural energy 
access and development.  The World Bank Group will also provide technical expertise for 
bringing modern energy services to rural areas and assist the realization of the West Africa 
Power Pool (WAPP) priority regional project.   

76.      Urban Development.  The World Bank will continue to assist urban development, slum 
upgrading, capacity building, and decentralization and to provide supporting policy advice.  As 
well as the investments in improving Monrovia’s streets, mentioned above, efforts will be made 
to sustain earlier emergency work in the area of solid waste collection, and the government is 
exploring a financing mechanism to gradually assume the cost of collection.  Ongoing support to 
identify a suitable site for a permanent landfill for Monrovia will continue.  Efforts to improve 
municipal revenue collections, introduce financial controls, consolidate operations, and build 
capacity at the sub-national level remain of prime importance.  

Theme 3: Facilitating Pro-Poor Growth  

CAS Outcome 4: Improve agriculture and natural resources management in ways that 
generate pro-poor growth 

77.      A key part of the CAS addresses needs in agriculture and natural resources 
management, which have been important traditional sources of growth.  Lending and non-
lending services seek to restore and improve productivity in these sectors, with an emphasis on 
jobs and incomes for poor workers and producers and on environmental sustainability.   

78.      Agriculture.  Liberia’s high poverty rates, low post-war productivity in agriculture, and 
dependence on imported food mean that the world food price crisis has taken a heavy toll on 
many of its people.  The two banks have responded with social protection programs, as described 
later in this chapter.  Going forward, Liberia needs not only to increase its domestic food 
production but also to raise productivity and achieve sustainability of supply in its export crops, 
which are a major source of jobs, income, and foreign exchange.   

79.      The World Bank Group will focus on improving agricultural productivity and production.  
The Agriculture and Infrastructure Development Project (US$5 million component) supports 
food crop and smallholder tree crop production for export.  Additional financing has been 
provided under the World Bank ’s Food Price Crisis Response Program to expand food crop 
production and to support quick-impact interventions to improve post-harvest infrastructure for 
the current planting season.  The project will also establish local seed multiplication facilities to 
produce around 1,000 metric tons of certified seed.  IFC is providing technical assistance in the 
agribusiness sector, and is considering several opportunities in tree crop investments.  The 
Foreign Investment Advisory Service (IFC and MIGA) is providing technical assistance for a 

28

 
 
model concession contract for tree crops.  Following from the recommendations of the DTIS, 
IFC and the World Bank will support the Government to design a national outgrower program 
for oil palm and rubber sectors to leverage FDI and promote a more inclusive plantation sector. 
The World Bank is also supporting the policy capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture and will 
work toward improving market access through the reconstruction of rural roads.  

80.      The ADB ’s Agriculture Sector Rehabilitation project (indicative UA 12 million or US$19 
million) aims to revamp the rice value chain, rice being Liberia ’s main staple food.  The project 
aims to increase agricultural productivity and income of small and medium scale farmers through 
the rehabilitation and reconstruction of rural feeder roads, storage, processing and marketing 
facilities, and water management/irrigation infrastructure for swamp rice cultivation, as well as 
increased extension and input support for production of crops.  This project has an indicative 
infrastructure component of over 80 percent.  The project will also support sector-specific 
capacity building efforts.  In addition, the African Development Bank will provide financing of 
UA3.0 million (US$4.7 million) under the Africa Food Crisis Response (AFCR) as part of 
budget support in 2008.  The government intends to use the AFCR funds for fertilizers, crop 
protection, and dissemination of the New Rice for Africa, and related activities which will ensure 
efficient implementation of subsequent medium-term food security interventions.  

81.      Forestry.  The World Bank will continue its analytical and advisory work under the 
multi-donor Liberia Forestry Initiative supported by a US$2 million grant from the Trust Fund 
for Liberia.  This uses a “three C’s” approach to forestry (commercial, conservation, and 
communities, with carbon financing cutting across all three), to achieve accountability, 
transparency, security, social responsibility, implementation of Liberia’s new Forestry Law, and 
drafting of a community rights law.  Public investments in forestry are currently financed by 
other donors and by tax revenues from logging.  In addition, GEF grants totaling US$1.7 million 
are supporting conservation and biodiversity efforts.   

82.      Mining.  Both industrial and small-scale artisanal mining are potentially important 
sources of growth and poverty reduction in Liberia, and both banks will contribute support in this 
sector. The World Bank Group expects to remain involved mainly on the governance front, 
through existing interventions such as the Economic Governance and Institutional Reform 
Project (EGIRP) and technical assistance under a regional mining initiative The projects will 
focus on assisting the government to identify ways and implement selected reforms to (i) 
promote and develop large-scale industrial mining as a source of substantial revenues and 
regional economic development; and (ii) develop and organize small-scale and artisanal mining 
in order to generate jobs and improve rural livelihoods. Regional dimensions of mining are 
discussed in the sections below. ADB’s private sector window is exploring supporting a project 
in iron mining in collaboration with IFC, and will continue to explore opportunities in this area.  
IFC is exploring several investment opportunities in the iron ore and gold sectors. 

83.      Natural Resource Management and Transparency.  Both banks are providing a range 
of support for Liberia’s implementation of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative 
(EITI), to enable Liberia to continue its strong progress towards EITI compliance.  This work is 
being done jointly to ensure complementarities of support to the government’s EITI Secretariat 
29

 
and the Ministry of Finance.  ADB has funded a scoping study for EITI in the forestry sector and 
provided Liberia with US$150,000 through the Nordic Trust Fund for Governance for the 
implementation of the costed work plan of EITI.  The World Bank is providing resources under 
its EITI Trust Fund.  Taking the work one step further, the World Bank will support a scoping 
study of the EITI ++ Initiative, bringing in the full value chain of natural resource management. 

84.      Regional Initiatives.  The World Bank will provide regional financial and technical 
support, leveraging some US$160 million in IDA financing, to tackle some of the most pressing 
issues affecting Liberia and its neighbors.  This includes collaborative efforts to raise 
productivity in rice production systems in countries bordering the Mano river and to facilitate 
cross-border trade of staple foods in this sub-region.  A regional mining initiative is expected to 
be launched, seeking to spur the harmonization of the mining regimes across the region and 
developing regional geological information database, stimulate broad economic linkages around 
large-scale mine development, build the capacity of core ministries on mining and associated 
finance and environment issues, and mitigate negative environmental and social impacts of 
mining across the sub-region.  In fisheries, the World Bank, with other development partners, 
will support a regional initiative aimed at sustainably increasing the overall wealth generated by 
Liberia’s marine fisheries and the proportion of that wealth captured by Liberia; this will include 
efforts to reduce illegal fishing and to strengthen Liberia’s capacity to govern and manage its 
fisheries.  In energy, the Bank and IFC will work in concert with the West Africa Power Pool 
program to facilitate a private sector response to restoring Liberia’s electricity generation 
capacity and taking advantage of energy work and connections within the sub-region.  In all of 
these areas, technical assistance has been ongoing informing the country dialogue and paving the 
way for implementation of the regional operations. 

CAS Outcome 5: Improved business and investment climate  

85.      Fostering private sector involvement in the development of key economic sectors is 
essential for overcoming Liberia’s key constraints on growth, including high prices of 
imports, governance, and poor infrastructure.  Through its post-conflict initiative, IFC has 
reengaged strongly in Liberia.  The Corporation plans to combine advisory, technical assistance, 
and investment operations to introduce innovative ways to mitigate risk, help improve the 
investment climate, strengthen the financial sector, build the capacity of small and medium 
enterprises, and mobilize local and foreign investors. 

30

 
 
Box 3: IFC strategy in Liberia  

IFC seeks to catalyze the role of private business in developing key sectors of Liberia ’s economy.  Its five 
broad goals under the Joint Assistance Strategy, as detailed in Annex 21, are to: 
• Strengthen the financial sector and increase access to finance.  The establishment of 
AccessBank Liberia, a commercial microfinance bank by  Access Holdings was strongly supported 
and financed by IFC and partners. IFC will provide Technical Assistance support to AccessBank 
Liberia; expand its Global Trade Finance Program and accelerate technical assistance for banks; 
explore opportunities to (i) establish a leasing company with a credible partner; and (ii) undertake 
wholesale lending to banks for SMEs. 
• Support private participation in infrastructure and finance select private companies.  As well as 
helping the government to select a private operator for supplying electricity to Monrovia, IFC will 
foster private participation in infrastructure (ports, airports, etc) and growth sectors (mining, oil palm, 
rubber, etc) and finance select private sector projects.  Working closely with the World Bank and 
African Development Bank, it will explore opportunities for exceptional financing from development 
partners for public-private partnerships (PPPs) in infrastructure, and pursue innovative project 
development for infrastructure PPPs. 
• Provide technical assistance and advocacy support for improving the investment climate.  
Activities in the first phase included identifying barriers to formalization of businesses, re-drafting the 
investment code, and creating the Liberian Better Business Forum for public-private dialogue, with an 
IFC-staffed secretariat.  The second phase centers on supporting regulatory reform and investment 
generation.  
• Support capacity building programs in both the private and public sector, including through a 
proposed IFC Schools Advisory Services program which will include technical and vocational schools, 
and access to financing through local commercial banks.. 

• 

Increase investments and advisory services support to SMEs.  IFC working on establishing an 
SME fund for Liberia (to be managed by a fund manager), complemented with technical assistance to 
the enterprises selected for investment.  The fund could offer creative financing solutions for small 
businesses that lack enough equity capital with which to obtain long-term financing to expand their 
businesses.  The TA  could also develop other SME expansion strategies e.g. incubate opportunities 
for SMEs along the value chain of Liberia ’s gr owth sectors (e.g.  out-grower schemes in oil 
palm/rubber, linkages program to distributors of soft drinks, breweries, water); structure wholesale 
lending products to local banks for on-lending to SME prospects; explore opportunities to create 
business incubators; and offer services to improve corporate governance in SMEs. .  

86.      Access to Finance.  Both IFC and the private sector window of ADB will work to 
increase access to finance for Liberian banks and businesses, especially small and medium 
enterprises. IFC will play a lead role in supporting private sector development, with a particular 
emphasis on encouraging SMEs. To improve the financing opportunities available to private 
businesses, IFC helped to establish a commercial microfinance bank—AccessBank Liberia— 
which will serve as a catalyst for the growth of microfinance banking in the country. IFC will 
also expand its Global Trade Finance Program; and accelerate technical assistance for Liberia’s 
banks, to improve the take-up and use of the Global Trade Finance program.  ADB ’s private 
sector window supports the Access Bank Liberia project, and is also exploring support to the 
Liberian Bank for Development and Industry to increase access to commercial and investment 
banking in Liberia.  Financing will be sought for technical assistance from trust funds such as the 
Fund for African Private Sector Assistance.  IDA will seek to complement IFC ’s activities 
through technical assistance for developing a policy framework for revitalizing the financial 
sector.  Activities in this sector will be closely coordinated with those of the IMF.  

31

 
 
87.      Investment Climate.  To help improve the overall investment climate, the IFC program 
includes continuing work to improve the regulatory environment and support investment 
generation through work with Liberia ’s National Investment Commission.  The first step of IFC 
support includes: identification of barriers to formalization, re-draft of the investment code, and 
creation of the Liberian Better Business Forum for public-private dialogue, with an IFC-staffed 
secretariat.  Recommendations on the way forward have been accepted by the government. 

88.      The second phase of the Investment Climate program is centered on the twin objectives 
of supporting regulatory reform and increasing investments.  Activities include:  

i) 

ii) 

iii) 

iv) 

reducing informality by easing the business registration process (financed by the 
Investment Climate Facility for Africa);  
improving trade logistics by reducing the time and costs of import and export 
transactions to foster Liberia’s integration into global markets;  
supporting investment generation through: (a) building the National Investment 
Commission capacity to facilitate investment attraction and investor outreach, by 
assisting its transition from an investment regulatory to a facilitating role; and (b) 
supporting the government’s development and implementation of a Special 
Economic Zone strategy to energize private sector investment in the development 
of a new industrial zone; and  
supporting the reform efforts of the Liberia Better Business Forum (LBBF) and 
the Liberia Business Reform Committee (a cabinet-level committee established 
by the President to identify and drive implementation of business climate and 
Doing Business reforms).  This support resulted in the achievement of 21 reforms 
in three Doing Business indicators in 2008.  

CAS Outcome 6: Increased access to social protection and social services in the face of 
shocks 

89.      Liberia ’s response to the global slowdown should focus on maintaining the strong 
reform agenda and continued macroeconomic prudence.  Continued strong collaboration 
between the Government and development partners will be paramount.  There may also be a 
need to strengthen the regional dialogue, to mitigate an increased threat of renewed hostility.  
Box 4 shows possible responses to the economic crisis, which the World Bank Group and the 
ADB Group could support as the situation unfolds.

Box 4: Possible Policy Responses to the Global Slowdown 

Shock-proofing public finances 
 Begin medium-term expenditure planning, including the Public Sector Investment Program (PSIP) to 
anticipate cash flows over a longer timeframe and plan for lumpy investments (infrastructure) 
 Broaden the fiscal revenue base through increased taxpayer registration 

Strengthen the supply response mechanism in agriculture 
 Provide mechanism to reduce risks (crop failure) in agriculture 
 Rebuild the extension and research services 

Protect the vulnerable  
 Support household income via public transfers including school feeding and cash for work 
 Develop simple means-testing for better targeting social protection efforts 
 Expedite the establishment of the labor market information system 

Educate the Liberian public about the causes of the financial crisis  
 Educate the press corps and spread awareness in Liberia about the global origins of the financial 
crisis, and the limitations on the government ’s abilitie s to contain its effects on the Liberian economy  

90.      Social Protection.  The need for social protection in Liberia is likely to increase as a 
result of the worldwide economic slowdown.  Both banks responded rapidly to the food price 
crisis in Liberia.  The World Bank organized the Liberia Emergency Food Price Crisis Response 
under its Global Food Crisis Response Program (GFRP), together with US$10 million from the 
new Food Price Crisis Response Trust Fund (FPCRTF).  The response combines quick-impact 
social protection measures for the most vulnerable populations with activities to spur agricultural 
production in areas with the most productive potential.  It also begins the process of building up 
new social protection institutions that will be important to stability in the medium term.  Specific 
activities include: (i) a program for vulnerable women and children, including a school feeding 
program implemented in partnership with the World Food Program, that is designed to feed up to 
62,000 children and keep 4,300 girls in school; (ii) a cash for work program for dry-season 
employment, which is expected to transfer cash to 17,000 people, including in marginalized 
urban areas in Monrovia where unrest is a significant threat to social stability; and (iii) a program 
to expedite the agricultural supply response by supplying essential inputs and interventions to 
reduce post-harvest losses and increase productivity in rice and cassava.  The ADB’s new Africa 
Food Crisis Response makes available quick-disbursing financing to allow the government to 
implement social protection measures, with additional activities to spur agricultural production.  
In addition, the World Bank and the ADB will favor labor-intensive building methods where 
feasible, recognizing that it will take considerable time for the private sector to generate enough 
jobs to meet Liberia ’s dire needs, and that lack of jobs could have serious consequences for 
social stability.  

91.      Community-Driven Development.  The World Bank will continue its existing CDD 
program (Liberia Community Empowerment Project II, US$5 million), which is being 
implemented through the Liberia Agency for Community Empowerment (LACE) with additional 
financing from other donors.  This program supports the rebuilding of community cohesion and 
social capital in addition to much-needed community infrastructure.  In addition, LACE will 
continue to implement the new social protection mechanism noted above.   

33

 
 
 
 
 
92.      Going forward, the World Bank will prepare a series of policy notes on shared 
growth that will help lay the basis for government ’s response to protecting the poorest, 
including employment generation, service delivery, and other social protection 
mechanisms.  In addition, the ADB has recently developed a framework of accelerated resource 
transfer to ADF countries in response the economic impact of the financial crisis.21 Possible 
short-term actions consist of either alternative use or accelerated use of currently available 
resources, with exploration of more resources for the longer term.   

93.      Finally, the World Bank will continue existing support for increasing access to basic 
services.  It will continue a strong program of analytic work in the education sector, aimed at 
improving government capacity to manage the sector and provide a possible foundation for 
accessing the Education For All Catalytic Fund.   The Liberia Emergency Health Project will 
also continue work to strengthen government capacity, rebuild critical health infrastructure, and 
train much-needed health workers.  In both health and education, other donors are taking the lead 
in managing pooled funds, but the World Bank is valued for its technical expertise and ability to 
mobilize donors. 

Cross-cutting objective: capacity development 

94.      Liberia’s stock of skilled people is sma ll even by the standards of post-conflict 
African countries.  To meet pressing needs, the World Bank and the ADB will exploit existing 
capacity across organizational boundaries, drawing on agencies that have some relevant 
implementation capacity if the more logical choice of government agency lacks this capacity.22   
In addition, World Bank ’s existing programs embed a wide-range of capacity building activities, 
explicitly seeking to build capacity with a combination of start-up implementation support, 
technical assistance, and training.  Meanwhile, the two banks will continue seek to help build 
capacity within implementation agencies for the longer term.  As partly described above, efforts 
will focus particularly on the Special Implementation Unit, the Ministry of Finance, Civil 
Service Agency, LACE, and the Liberia Water and Sewerage Corporation.  The World Bank will 
support a project coordination unit in the Ministry of Agriculture to begin to develop project 
management capacity; it is expected that future agriculture sector operations from both banks - 
and others - will be located within this unit.  In addition, the banks will continue their work with 
Parliament and the Ministry of Finance around the budget process—a critical component of 
public financial management reform.  The World Bank will support a training program for 
members of Parliament on budget development and analysis, budgetary oversight and processes, 
and fiscal policy and planning, and will also help to strengthen the capacity of the Liberian 
Institute of Public Administration.  In addition to the existing Senior Executive Service program 
that aims to attract qualified Liberians back to the civil service, the World Bank will look further 
support the mobilization of the Liberian Diaspora to support Liberia ’s development.  It will 
continue support for the Institute for Public Financial Management, an innovative program to 

21 Bank Response To The Economic Impact of the Financial Crisis (ADF/BD/WP/2009/32). 
22 For example, the Liberia Agency for Community Empowerment (LACE) was created through World Bank project 
finance as a national agency for community-driven development.  But now, to help respond to the food-price crisis, 
it is being modified to be able to implement a US$3 million cash-for-work scheme under the Emergency Food Crisis 
Response Program.  

34

 
                                                 
train young Liberians to take over management of public finances in the coming years.  Finally, 
it will look to provide support to civil society to increase its capacity to demand accountability in 
governance.  The ADB is providing capacity building assistance to the Ministry of Finance in 
public financial management and macro-fiscal analysis.   Both banks will carry out further 
assessments of capacity building needs during the CAS period, so as to broaden the 
understanding of the capacity challenge in Liberia, and will develop a set of tailored instruments 
supported by analytic work, grants, and secondments, among others.   

Strategic mainstreaming 

95.      Gender equity.   The CAS will promote gender equality and women’s economic 
empowerment wherever such opportunities arise.  The World Bank will continue its program of 
technical and advisory services to build capacity on gender equality and women’s empowerment 
in Liberia, supported by trust funds such as the Multi-Donor Trust Fund for the Gender Action 
Plan and the Bank-Netherlands Partnership, through its Governance Window.  The activities will 
build on ongoing projects and programs including the US$4.6 million project for Economic 
Empowerment of Adolescent Girls, supported by the Nike Foundation and the Government of 
Denmark, and the UNIFEM Results Based Initiative.  Analytical work will focus on 
understanding determinants of and constraints on Liberian women’s economic empowerment, to 
help with the prioritization and mainstreaming of relevant gender interventions in the proposed 
lending portfolio.  This work will be aligned with the World Bank Gender Action Plan’s focus 
on women’s economic empowerment.  The World Bank will also contribute to strengthening the 
collection of sex-disaggregated data to facilitate the tracking of gender-relevant indicators.  

96.      Environmental sustainability.  Under the CAS, the World Bank and the ADB will 
allocate resources mainly through the infrastructure, agriculture, and potential extractive 
industries programs to further build environmental planning and management capacity in 
Liberia’s line ministries and agencies—notably the Environment Protection Agency (EPA), the 
Ministry of Public Works, the Forest Development Authority (FDA), the Ministry of Lands, 
Mines and Energy, and the Liberia Water and Sewerage Corporation —in tandem with the 
scaling up of investments in the sectors for which they are responsible.  The Global Environment 
Facility will support work to strengthen the management of natural resources and protected 
areas.   The Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) will be mobilized to 
help Liberia develop a natural disaster risk reduction and prevention strategy both at the national 
and community levels. 

C. 

Lending  

97.      The implementation of the CAS is supported by a number of existing and new 
financial instruments.  These include:  IDA, the African Development Fund, the Fragile States 
Facility (should access be granted), the Trust Fund for Liberia, the Liberia Reconstruction and 
Development Trust Fund, and others, as well as by analytical and advisory work as described in 
the following section.  

35

 
98.      The banks ’ new lending programs during the CAS period will combine development 
policy operations, budget support operations, and investment lending in support of the 
three strategic themes and the crosscutting objective of the joint strategy.  The development 
policy operations are intended to help address Liberia ’s external financing needs while the export 
sectors recover, as well as to support the policy and institutional changes that are needed to 
create the environment for pro-poor growth and safeguard against external shocks.  The 
investment lending will support the rebuilding of the economic and social infrastructure 
necessary for enhancing growth and improving social stability, scaling up primarily from 
existing programs. 

99.      The operational pipeline for the World Bank and ADB over the next three years 
adds up to some US$503 million (Table 4).  The World Bank’s three-year IDA allocation is 
about SDR 85.8 m (or US$138 million23).  It is also expected that IDA regional resources will be 
determined during the CAS period based on operational needs and under the new rules for IDA 
15 for small country programs, leveraging up to around US$160 million in additional resources. 
The FY09 program will include up to 55% frontloading to help finance larger up-front 
infrastructure investments, avoiding spreading these out across fiscal years. The Liberia 
Reconstruction Trust Fund is expected to contribute around US$120 million in donor financing 
to complement the IDA program.   

100.     The African Development Bank Group ’s assistance to Liberia under the CAS will 
be provided within the framework of ADF-11 (2008-2010), part of ADF-12 (2011-2013), and 
the Fragile States Facility (subject to Liberia’s eligibility to the FSF).  ADF 11 performance-
based indicative country allocation (as of 2008) amounts to UA 29.81 million (US$46.5 million).  
The indicative potential FSF supplemental financing amounts to UA13.01 million (US$20.3 
million), and indicative potential FSF financing from the targeted support window amounts to 
UA 1.3 million (US$2.00 million).  Total indicative ADF and potential FSF financing under 
ADF-11 cycle thus amounts to UA 44.12 million (US$68.8 million).  Indicative financing in the 
amount of UA 9 million (US$14.0) may be sought from ADF-12 resources.  Additional 
financing from the African Food Crisis Response amounts to UA 3.0 million (US$4.7 million), 
and will be provided under the 2008 budget support operation.  Total indicative financing during 
the CAS period is thus UA 56.12 million (US$87.5 million).   ADB allocates an indicative 
US$32.76 million under Pillar I (2 BSOs), an indicative US$31.2 million under Pillar II (WSS), 
and indicative US$18.72 million under Pillar III (agriculture), an indicative US$2.00 million for 
capacity building activities, and an indicative US$2.82 million for potential participation in 
regional programs.   

23 This reflects an average annual allocation of SDR 28.6 million during each of the years. Actual allocations in the 
outer years will depend on: (i) the country ’s own performance; (ii) its performance relative to that of other IDA 
recipients; (iii) the amount of overall resources available to IDA; (iv) changes in the list of active IDA-eligible 
countries; (v) terms of financial assistance provided (grants or loans); and (vi) the amount of compensatory 
resources received for MDRI.  IDA and ADB allocations are made in SDRs and in UA respectively, and the US$ 
equivalent is dependent upon the prevailing exchange rate.

101.     Preparation of Projects under OP/BP 8.0024.  Since 2006, all projects in the Liberia 
portfolio have been prepared under emergency procedures, first OP/BP 8.50 and subsequently 
the new OP/BP 8.00 “Rapid Response to Crises and Emergencies ”.  OP/BP 8.00 has put in place 
streamlined project preparation procedures to enable quick response to urgent needs on the 
ground in Liberia.  On the other hand, the new policy is premised on the need for intensive 
project management and supervision, particularly in low-capacity post-conflict environments like 
Liberia.  Over time, it is expected that Liberia will transition into regular investment lending with 
less of a demand on intensive implementation support from the Bank.  The focus in the CAS on 
building implementation capacity aims to fulfill this objective.  In the meantime, it is proposed 
that some Bank projects will continue to be prepared under the aegis of OP/BP 8.00.  Projects 
financed by the Liberia Multi-Donor Trust Fund will be prepared using the Bank's rapid response 
policies and procedures, since the use of these procedures form part of its governance 
arrangements agreed by all donors. These arrangements will be reviewed at the time of 
preparation of the CAS Progress Report.   

D. 

Non-lending Program  

102.     Knowledge creation and transfer is a fundamental part of the work of the World 
Bank Group and the ADB in Liberia, particularly in view of the relatively small allocations 
of funding relative to Liberia’s vast needs.  A large body of analytic work has been 
substantially completed during the past year under the ISN, including a public expenditure 
financial accountability (PEFA) survey; a comprehensive poverty diagnostic; a public 
expenditure management and financial accountability review (PEMFAR); a comprehensive 
assessment of agriculture; education and health sector assessments; and a diagnostic trade 
integration study, and policy notes on pro-poor growth.  Currently underway are more 
comprehensive studies in education and natural resource management.  Analytic work on EITI++ 
and mining may also be carried out. A second poverty diagnostic will be completed and will be 
followed by a poverty assessment.  The dissemination of these reports will provide the basis for 
policy discussions with government and other development partners on the country ’s 
development priorities. 

103.     The two banks will align their analytical work, like their lending, to the strategic themes 
and crosscutting issue of the CAS, focusing on creating the knowledge base for strong policy 
advice and on identifying specific strategies for enhancing pro-poor growth.   

104.     Table 5 provides an overview of anticipated analytic work over the CAS period.  
The two banks will undertake analytic work jointly where possible.

Trust Funds  

105.     While it was still in arrears to the international financial institutions, Liberia relied 
heavily on trust funds to allow World Bank and ADB interventions.  Because of the need to 
access a number of different instruments (e.g. LICUS, TFLIB, NTFG), this led to a highly 
fragmented and transaction-intensive portfolio. Under the CAS, trust funds will be used 
selectively, to leverage existing resources or to put in place large interventions where IDA and 
ADF do not play a role (Table 6).  The recently launched Liberia Reconstruction and 
Development Trust Fund (LRTF) for infrastructure is expected to make available around 
US$120 million during the CAS period.  Contributions and pledges currently include Germany 
(US$24 million in 2007/2008); Sweden (US$10 million); European Commission (US$80 
million); Ireland (US$4 million); and the World Bank (US$3 million – LICUS Trust Fund). For 
infrastructure investments, the ADB will assess whether the alternative of channeling such 
resources through the LRTF is preferable. The fund will leverage World Bank capacity and 
knowledge to assist the government in preparing and implementing infrastructure reconstruction.  
LRTF projects will be integrated into the IDA portfolio; they are designed and prepared under 
IDA emergency policies and procedures in order to exploit synergies with existing World Bank 
39

 
 
 
 
 
 
infrastructure projects.  Projects will be programmed according to Government PRS priorities 
and are expected to center mainly on transport and sanitation infrastructure in the initial period. 

106.     Other planned and potential trust-funded activities during the CAS period include: 
the support from the Global Environment Facility, mentioned above, for management of natural 
resource and protected areas; potential support for land tenure reform from the new State and 
Peace building Trust Fund; and continuation of very successful TA support for telecoms 
regulatory reform.  Trust fund financing may also be sought during the CAS period from the 
Education for All Catalytic Fund, which could bring large resources to bear in the education 
sector, where IDA and ADF operations are constrained.  Pending continued satisfactory 
performance, the Cash For Work program under the Food Price Crisis Response program may 
seek resources to scale up its activities.  Smaller trust funds could be used judiciously to support 
ongoing initiatives, for example to support EITI implementation, debt reduction, activities 
supporting the rule of law, and financial sector reform.  ADB will continue to pursue trust fund 
financing for governance reform, including land reform.   

VI. CAS MONITORING 

107.     The CAS has been designed with a strong focus on achieving and demonstrating 
results on the ground.  The CAS Results Framework (shown in Annex 1) uses Liberia’s PRS as 
its starting point, and narrows down the range of PRS objectives to those that the World Bank 
and ADB can demonstrably contribute to during the CAS period.  Given that results during the 
CAS period will come mainly from already-existing operations and the quicker-disbursing 
interventions, the results framework is closely linked with the expected results of the ongoing 
portfolio of operations and analytical work.  The framework has been formulated in light of the 
capacity constraints on results management in Liberia.  The CAS Monitoring and Evaluation 
Plan (shown in Annex 2) details the baselines and targets for all indicators and milestones, as 
well as the sources and responsibilities for data collection and monitoring.  

108.     The CAS outcomes will be monitored jointly by the World Bank Group, the ADB 
Group, and the government over the CAS period.  As noted, the ADB Sierra Leone Field 
Office will enhance the M&E activities of ADB in Liberia.  Regular portfolio reviews aligned 
with the results framework will be carried out, jointly with other development partners when 
possible.  At mid term, a CAS Progress Report will be prepared, and mid-course adjustments 
may be made in light of its findings or of changing country circumstances.  A completion report 
will be prepared at the end of the CAS period.

109.     All new operations will be designed with a focus on clearly defined outcomes, sound 
results measurement, and M&E arrangements adapted to Liberia’s situation.  During the 
start-up phase of the two banks’ current Liberian operations, monitoring information was scarce 
but programs needed to get up and running quickly.  As the program matures and more data 
become available, collection and reporting on outcomes is being strengthened across the 
portfolio.  An effort will be made to improve project-level M&E, paying appropriate attention to 
the emergency context of many operations.  In this connection it will be important, given the 

41

 
 
 
limited capacity in many ministries, to align with and strengthen existing sectoral M&E efforts 
as well as to support the system that is being established to monitor the implementation of 
Liberia ’s PRS.  The World Bank and the ADB are planning to focus particularly on supporting 
the development of sound M&E systems related to infrastructure, agriculture, and public 
financial management. 

VII. PARTNERSHIPS AND PARTICIPATION 

A. Partnerships and Donor Coordination 

110.     Total official development assistance to Liberia is estimated at US$357 million for 
2007.25 This excludes UNMIL ’s peacekeeping operations.  The largest donor is the United States 
government, which provided almost US$100 million, followed by the combined contribution of 
the UN agencies, at almost US$90 million, and the World Bank, at about US$40 million in 2007.  
In addition to ODA, Liberia receives significant support from private foundations including the 
Soros Foundation, Clinton Foundation, and Gates Foundation.  The bulk of aid to date has been 
dedicated to security sector reform, health, education, and infrastructure.  Data on aid flows are 
limited and most of the funding is not channeled through government structures.   

111.     Development assistance is coordinated through the Liberia Reconstruction and 
Development Committee (LRDC), which was established in 2006.  LRDC is a transitional 
mechanism that provides a platform for dialogue between the government and development 
partners, and is organized around the four PRS pillars.  Cooperation among lead donors has been 
strong, but aid coordination vis-à-vis the government has been less so, and the government has 
had limited tools and information with which to monitor the aid flows coming into the country.  
The government is making significant efforts to strengthen its capacity to monitor aid flows and 
interventions.  For its part, the LRDC has made it a priority to foster harmonized and accurate 
donor reporting on disbursements for development.  Its recently completed Paris Declaration 
Survey on Aid Coordination and Harmonization will help in establishing a benchmark and 
monitoring system.  More predictable sector strategies, combined with more Liberian (versus 
donor) execution of projects, and, eventually, donors’ contributions to budget support, will 
improve the government’s control over its reconstruction resources and agenda.  In fact, more 
donors are moving towards putting their aid on budget, including early indications from the EC 
and the ADB. 

112.     Liberia provides a strong example of donor coordination at the operational level.  
Table 7 shows the main areas of support by each main donor.  Consistent with a fragile-states 
approach, donors concentrate in a few key areas, aligning their support and sending common 
messages to government.  For example, the US, the World Bank, the ADB, the EC, and the IMF 
all support fundamental economic governance reforms, but ensure that their programs are 
mutually reinforcing.  In water supply and sanitation, where the ADB is now the lead agency, the 
World Bank will not undertake new work during the CAS period.  The World Bank is the

relies on the UNDP to administer more than US$20 million in World Bank grant funding.  In 
road building, the European Commission will channel resources through the World Bank-
managed Liberia Reconstruction and Development Trust Fund for infrastructure.

113.     A move to budget support will increase efficiency.  As the government increases its 
capacity for transparent financial management, a transition will be needed whereby donors 
channel more of their aid through the national budget.  This will allow the implementation of 
larger, more effective, and “mainstream” programs, rather than the proliferation of “pilot” and 
small post-conflict initiatives that has been typical since the conflict ended. 

B. Participation 

114.     In 2007/08, government carried out comprehensive consultations as a part of the 
development and validation process for the Poverty Reduction Strategy.  As well as 
providing deep insights into people’s interests, the key messages of the consultations became the 
basis for the four pillars of the PRS, which together make up the country ’s strategic framework 
for development.  The key messages of the consultations were:  

(cid:129) National security.  Despite an improvement in security since the end of the civil war, crime 
and violence are still prevalent.  Liberians cited the shortage of qualified security staff, the 
incidence of corruption, and the public ’s distrust in the police force. 
43

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(cid:129) 

Economic revitalization.  The public noted that agriculture, roads, and access to finance are 
the highest priorities. 
(cid:129) Governance and rule of law.  The consultations revealed that corruption is present at all 
levels of government. 
Infrastructure and basic services.  The consultations emphasized shortages in four sectors, in 
the following order of importance: (i) roads; (ii) safe drinking water and electricity; (iii) 
educational facilities and trained teachers; and (iv) healthcare facilities and trained medical 
personnel. 

(cid:129) 

VIII. MANAGING RISK  

115.     Liberia ’s fragile economic and social situation puts it at risk from external shocks.  
The CAS supports a holistic approach to mitigating such risks.  This includes World Bank 
Group support from the Food Price Crisis Trust Fund to put in place a cash-for-work social 
safety net program and a program to increase agricultural productivity, and ADB ’s increased 
budget support and investments in raising agricultural productivity.  IFC is globally working to 
shore up the private sector with facilities that will ensure private sector trade flows through its 
trade finance program, focus on keeping infrastructure projects on track and shift advisory 
support to help companies weather the crisis.  In addition, the World Bank will support 
appropriate macroeconomic policy responses to external shocks through its programs of targeted 
budget support, and both the World Bank and ADB will work with the IMF to ensure that their 
policy positions are mutually consistent.  And, as noted in Box 4 above, the World Bank stands 
ready to assist the government with further possible policy responses to the global slowdown. 

116.     Liberia faces considerable risks following the disruptions caused by the civil 
conflict.  A major risk is that of insecurity.  Although the deployment of UNMIL 
peacekeepers and police has restored peace and stabilized most parts of the country, the state 
institutions and mechanisms (including the police and judiciary) that are responsible for 
protecting citizens ’ human rights remain fragile and underdeveloped.  In particular, the large 
number of ex-combatants awaiting reintegration and rehabilitation opportunities, as well as the 
political groups who have been marginalized in the new political context, might pose challenges 
to security.  Further, the unstable regional context, including in Côte d’Ivoire and Guinea, 
continues to present an external risk.  Thus, UNMIL ’s continued presence under a strong 
Security Council mandate is critical, as are enhanced efforts by the government to reform 
security institutions and reintegrate ex-combatants into Liberian society.  

117.     Widespread unemployment and the perception that peace has only limited tangible 
benefits pose a risk to stability during the CAS period.  This risk cannot be fully mitigated.  It 
is being addressed through the creation of a national urban and rural employment program, under 
the Liberia Agency for Community Empowerment, which that can be scaled up in the future.  
The work to be carried out on pro-poor economic growth will need to generate both short-term 
and structural employment for the working classes as a critical part of Liberia’s return to stability 
in the medium term. 

44

 
 
118.     The government ’s shortage of capacity to implement reforms poses another 
significant risk.  This risk is mitigated by the support provided by development partners, but 
substantial additional efforts to build capacity are urgently needed.  As discussed above, the CAS 
will build capacity at the project implementation level, support civil service reform, and help to 
build the capacity of specific government agencies in charge of implementing reforms.  The 
World Bank Institute will continue its support on strengthening the Liberian Parliament’s role in 
the budget process. 

119.     Corruption is an additional risk.  Corruption and the abuse of power and privileges 
continue to impede effective policy implementation, public service delivery, and the reduction of 
poverty.  Yet the government has shown a firm commitment to fight corruption, by finalizing an 
anti-corruption strategy and passing anti-corruption legislation.  It has shown its commitment to 
enhancing governance, transparency, and accountability in the work of the public sector through 
the continued implementation of GEMAP and it is embracing the Extractive Industries 
Transparency Initiative. 

120.     A further risk concerns the government ’s ability to get legislation passed by 
Parliament, where the President’s political party lacks a majority.  A failure to win the 
support of members of other parties could undermine the government’s reform efforts .  
Continued strong demonstrations of international support for the current administration’s anti-
corruption efforts—combined with judicious attention to internal fiduciary controls and external 
private sector/civil society scrutiny and appropriate capacity building—are expected to help 
mitigate these risks.  

121.     Given the emphasis on building new infrastructure and potential development in 
Liberia ’s mining sector, the government ’s ability to address environmental issues and 
manage environmental and social impacts is crucially important.  Dedicated capacity to 
regulate and manage environmental impacts is not yet keeping pace with needs.  Under the CAS, 
the World Bank and the ADB will allocate resources (primarily through infrastructure programs) 
to further build environmental planning and management capacity in key line ministries and 
agencies, notably the EPA; the Ministry of Public Works; the FDA; the Ministry of Lands, 
Mines, and Energy; and the Liberia Water and Sewerage Corporation, as investments are scaled 
up in the sectors for which they are responsible.  

IX. SCALING UP AND EXIT STRATEGY 

122.     If current circumstances continue, the World Bank will continue to provide post-
conflict allocations from IDA in line with current IDA allocation policy, the IFC will 
continue to engage and actively explore private sector financing opportunities, and the 
ADB will operate under ADF and Fragile States Facility (should access be granted) policy.  
Provided Liberia’s policy performance is satisfactory, the World Bank expects to provide modest 
annual budget support operations.  Satisfactory implementation of the investment portfolio 
would provide an important basis for moving forward with the new operations outlined in the 
joint strategy.  

45

 
 
123.     In the event of unsatisfactory progress on reform, the World Bank and ADB would 
enter into dialogue regarding the basis of future budget support operations.  Should poor 
portfolio performance arise, the World Bank and ADB would adjust their operations as needed, 
revising implementation schedules and planned activities, or, in the case of severe obstacles, 
would partially suspend their activities.  Lack of progress on reform would also affect the private 
sectors appetite for investment and thus the ability of IFC and ADB to finance private sector 
projects.  Despite the significant challenges and risks, the World Bank Group and the ADB 
Group remain committed to staying engaged in Liberia over the long term.

5.2  Increased access to micro-credit 
for micro-enterprises (IFC,ADB) 

• Administrative and 
regulatory barriers severely 
limit the ability of 
businesses, especially SMEs, 
to operate effectively and 
efficiently. 
• Outdated provisions of the 
investment code create 
obstacles to domestic and 
foreign investment. 
• Majority of payments are 
made in cash, which 
undermines security and 
flexibility of finances and 
credit 
• Financing for productive 
investments for the poor and 
for MSMEs is limited 
• High volume of non-

Annex 13:  Liberia:  Country Financing Parameters 

1.  This note describes the application of the policy for expenditure eligibility in World Bank financing 
to the Liberia program and proposes a corresponding set of country financing parameters. The 
Government of Liberia has been consulted and welcomes the increased flexibility the parameters 
would provide. 

I.  BACKGROUND 

2.  Liberia has embarked on the process of recovery from a devastating 14-year civil war.  In January 
2006, an elected government headed by a strong reformer, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, came to power, after 
a two-year transitional appointed government – the National Transitional Government of Liberia 
(NTGL). The new government has firmly demonstrated its commitment to reform, agreeing on 
implementation of the Governance and Economic Management Assistance Program (GEMAP), which 
has instituted strong expenditure controls in the Ministry of Finance, as well as introduced a zero-
tolerance policy on corruption.  The government is making good progress towards these reforms and 
donors are beginning to implement projects using the government’s system.  

3.  Accrual Status.  Liberia entered accrual status in December 2007, after clearing arrears to the Bank. 
Prior to arrears clearance, Liberia has been in non-accrual status since 1987, and as a result has been 
receiving a combination of financing from the LICUS Trust Fund, the special Trust Fund for Liberia 
(TIFLIB)28, as well as an IDA pre-arrears clearance grant.  

4.  Fiscal and Debt Situation.  The government budget has risen rapidly during the reconstruction 
period, from US$80 million in 2005/06 to an estimated US$199 million in 2007/08, but per capita 
public expenditure remains extremely low and most aid flows are external to the budget. Although 
there have been significant improvements, the public financial management system remains weak. 
Total revenue excluding grants was US$85 million (14.8 percent of GDP) in 2005/06, rose to US$147 
million (21.9 percent of GDP) in 2006/07, and is projected to rise to over US$186 million (24 percent 
of GDP) in 2007/08.  As the government functions on a cash basis, this also sets a ceiling on 
expenditures. Capital expenditures are low, and the majority of investment expenditure is financed by 
foreign development assistance. However, revenues are expected to continue growing rapidly as the 
lifting of UN timber sanctions in 2006 is expected to contribute to additional increase in government 
revenues from timber exports when production fully resumes in 2008, and a large iron-ore mining 
operation is projected to come on stream by late 2010. 

5.  Following the war, the government inherited large external and domestic debts. The external debt 
was estimated at US$4.8 billion (almost 700 percent of GDP).  The value of all outstanding domestic 
claims was US$914 million in January 2007.  The government has made substantial progress towards a 
resolution of its unsustainable debt burden.  Liberia cleared its arrears to the World Bank and African 
Development Bank in December 2007 and entered a PRGF/EFF program with the IMF in March 2008, 
enabling Liberia to access funds to clear its arrears to the IMF, thereby, restoring its drawing and

Assistance to Liberia: Proposed Establishment of a Trust Fund for Liberia, (IDA/R2004-0211) August 9, 2004. Its aim is to 
provide support for infrastructure, service delivery, and a distance learning center.

voting rights, and reaching the Decision Point under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative.  The HIPC 
Initiative will enable the government to access debt relief from multilateral donors.  

6.  Public Financial Management.  The government has taken significant steps to improve fiscal 
management.  The interministerial Cash Management Committee (CMC) and the payment process of 
which it is part have been strengthened, introducing signature accountability for authorizations at every 
step from the budget to the final payment.  To accompany a new procurement law that decentralizes 
procurement to the line ministries, procurement agents in these ministries have been trained in public 
financial management.  This has resulted in a more efficient authorization process with fewer 
documents being rejected by the CMC as incomplete or not justified by the annual budget.  
Transparency is assured by the oversight of GEMAP experts within the Bureau of the Budget, the 
Ministry of Finance, and the CBL, thus assuring that the integrity of the chain of expenditures has been 
established and maintained.  The draft budget, the final budget, quarterly budget execution reports and 
annual fiscal outturn reports are published on the web site of the Ministry of Finance, as are monthly 
revenue outturns and the regular financial reports of the SOEs. Similarly, reports by those revenue 
generating institutions covered by GEMAP are published on the GEMAP website.  

7.  Donor Response.  Weak governance during transitional appointed government led to an agreement 
in late 2005 among all major donors on the Governance and Economic Management Assistance 
Program (GEMAP)—a multi-donor mechanism to get basic public financial management controls in 
place and build government capacity to manage public finances.  The World Bank, the US, and the EC 
are financing major components of the control mechanisms of the GEMAP, which has received strong 
support from the new President and her Cabinet. GEMAP–supported public financial management 
reforms have led to tangible increases in government revenue and increased transparency in the budget 
process.  In addition, the government entered a three-year IMF Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility 
(PRGF) in March 2008, focusing on strengthening revenue collection and expenditure control.  

8.  Bank Strategy.  The Bank’s current operations in Liberia are guided by the Interim Strategy Note 
(ISN), approved by the Board on June 14, 2007.  The ISN is aligned with the I-PRSP along three of its 
four pillars – economic revitalization, governance and rule of law, and infrastructure and basic 
services.  The Bank is currently in the process of developing a three-year Country Assistance Strategy 
(CAS), building on the government’s recently completed PRSP.  

9.  Bank Portfolio.  The Bank currently has US$162 million in commitments with another US$400 
million of Bank-managed projects in the pipeline from various financing sources29. With the 
completion of the CAS, the Bank is expecting an annual IDA allocation of approximately US$45 
million.  The existing portfolio includes US$126 million in infrastructure and basic services (road 
rehabilitation, port rehabilitation, energy, water urban works, health, education and community-driven 
development projects); US$17 million for economic revitalization projects (forestry, public financial 
management, procurement reform and budget support); and US$4.5 million for governance and 
judicial reform.  

10.  Pipeline.  The tentative pipeline for the coming three years, totals around US$400 million is 
expected to focus heavily on infrastructure, including roads and bridge rehabilitation; with continued 
support to the public financial management reform program and a civil service reform program; 
support to the growth sectors to stimulate economic recovery (forestry, agriculture and mining) and 
some smaller support to social protection.  

29 This includes the expected IDA allocation, IDA regional financing, and LRTF donor contributions.

II.  COUNTRY FINANCING PARAMETERS 

11.  Section II discusses the four components of country financing parameters (cost sharing, recurrent 
cost financing, local cost financing, and taxes and duties) as they apply to Liberia. 

A.  Cost Sharing 

12.  In Liberia’s fragile post-conflict environment, th ere is little scope at this time for Government to 
provide direct contributions to project financing.  While it is feasible that some co-financing from other 
donors could be made available in some instances as a means of reducing the Bank ’s share in project 
financing, it is expected that flexibility to go up to 100 percent financing will be needed in all Bank-
financed projects for the medium term.  As public financial management reforms are implemented, aid 
begins to be channeled through the budget, and production of timber resumes with the lifting of UN 
sanctions, Government may have greater leeway for own-financing of its public expenditure program 
including development projects. 

13.  The Bank is now focusing on interventions that are reflected in the Government ’s PRS to ensure 
greater ownership of Bank-financed programs. At the project level, ownership is being ensured 
through close supervision and capacity-building of government institutions.  A significant proportion 
of projects are now government executed, primarily through the Special Implementation Unit within 
the Ministry of Public Works, and Project Financial Management Unit within the Ministry of Finance.  
In addition, some projects work directly to strengthen government capacity, such as the Community 
Empowerment project financed by TFLIB, which is building the capacity of a new Liberian 
Community Empowerment Agency which is a national entity responsible for all community-driven 
development work in the country.  

B.  Recurrent Cost Financing 

14.  It is expected that the government will request the Bank to finance recurrent costs in all projects 
implemented over the medium term.  The majority of recurrent costs will finance external and 
domestic experts responsible for launching projects and for the capacity building required for eventual 
government takeover, in addition to general operating costs, including salaries for workers on projects.  
The upcoming IDA-financed infrastructure projects, the Economic Governance and Institutional 
Reform Project and other governance projects will all include these types of recurrent costs.  The 
government’s weak fiscal situation argues for Bank financing of recurrent costs simply to ensure 
sustainability of the Bank and government’s development investments until the situation begins to 
normalize.  

15.  All World Bank financing over the next three years will take the form of IDA or trust fund grants, 
to avoid adding to Government ’s debt burden.  Bank financing of recurrent costs per se would not have 
an adverse impact on the country’s debt sustainabilit y.  Nonetheless, the Bank will continue to monitor 
the fiscal situation, public expenditure management, and public sector reforms to ensure that recurrent 
cost financing is embedded in a credible and sustainable government macroeconomic strategy.  As the 
situation normalizes, the Bank will re-assess the need for Bank-financed recurrent costs, in order to 
ensure sustainability of Bank projects. 

16.  Based on the above assessment, no country-level limit is being set on recurrent cost financing.  
Recurrent costs may be financed as needed in individual projects, subject to project or program-level 

81

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
assessment.  In determining Bank financing of recurrent costs in individual projects, the Bank will take 
into account sustainability issues at the sector and project levels, including a consideration of implied 
future budgetary outlays. 

C.  Local Cost Financing 

17.  The criteria for World Bank financing of local costs have been met.  First, the recently completed 
PRSP estimates the financing needs for Liberia ’s reconstruction and development over the three-year 
PRS period to be approximately US$1.6 billion, which is well beyond the internal resources of the 
government.  The government estimates that it will be able to commit US$510 million to PRS 
financing, leaving a financing gap of about US$1.1 billion.  

18.  Second, the financing of foreign expenditures alone would not enable the World Bank to assist in 
the financing of individual projects.  The World Bank’s current portfolio focuses primarily on projects 
in the infrastructure and social sectors, both of which have a high element of local expenditure.  
Further, the government is deeply concerned about unemployment and its potential threat to security 
and development, and has requested the Bank to support local employment creation through labor-
intensive infrastructure construction, which necessitates a high proportion of local costs.  Current 
infrastructure rehabilitation projects include local cost financing of approximately 25% of the total 
project amount.  Thus, the World Bank may finance local costs in any proportions required by 
individual projects. 

D.  Taxes and Duties 

19.  In design, Liberia has a reasonable tax system.  Direct taxes include a progressive personal income 
tax beginning at 2 percent and capped at 35 percent, with withholding at source.  Larger businesses 
face a company income tax of 30 percent; small businesses pay a 4 percent turnover tax while the 
smallest enterprises pay a fixed petty trader tax.  However, in application, because of weak capability 
to collect direct taxes, government depends upon trade taxes for 48 percent of its tax revenue 
(2006/07).  Customs duties provide the bulk of this revenue, and ranges from 2.5% to 25%. In addition, 
an export tax of 0-4 percent on exports, diamonds, and precious metals can be credited against income 
tax and thus serves as a partial palliative to poor tax collection.  Since 2001 there has been a 7 percent 
tax on goods and services, although the government intends to progressively increase GST to 10% over 
three years starting in 2008/09.  Table 2 provides a summary of the main tax rates.  Bank financed 
projects are taxed at the same rates as the country ’s normal rates, or in some cases are exempted from 
taxes and duties.

taxes and duties associated with project expenditures.  The application of this general approach will be 
subject to an ongoing monitoring of tax policy and how taxes are applied to Bank-financed projects.  
At the project level, the Bank would consider whether taxes and duties constitute an excessively high 
share of project costs.

Remarks/Explanation 
All projects are expected to be financed at 100%, 
given the government ’s extremely small budget 
and inability to provide counterpart funding. In 
the near term, only when co-financing is available 
will IDA ’s share be less. Ownership of Bank-
financed programs is being ensured through 
alignment of the Bank ’s program and the PRSP 
and through ongoing dialogue.. At the project 
level, ownership is being ensured through close 
supervision and capacity-building of government 
institutions. A significant proportion of projects 
are now government executed, primarily through 
the Special Implementation Unit within the 
Ministry of Public Works, and Project Financial 
Management Unit within the Ministry of Finance. 
The Bank, working closely with the IMF, would 
monitor the fiscal situation, and public 
expenditure management and public sector 
reforms to ensure that recurrent cost financing is 
embedded in a credible and sustainable 
government macroeconomic strategy. In 
determining Bank financing of recurrent costs in 
individual projects, the Bank will take into 
account sustainability issues at the sector and 
project levels, including a consideration of 
implied future budgetary outlays. 
The requirements for local cost financing are met. 
The Bank may finance local costs in any 
proportions required by individual projects. 

Taxes and duties are considered reasonable. The 
application of this general approach will be 
subject to an ongoing monitoring of tax policy 
and how taxes are applied to Bank-financed 
projects. At the project level, the Bank will 
consider whether taxes and duties constitute an 
excessively high share of project costs.

Annex 14:  Joint Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability Analysis 

The low-income country debt sustainability analysis (LIC DSA) reveals that Liberia is in debt distress, 
emphasizing the need for debt relief.30 31  Under the alternative scenario which assumes full delivery of 
HIPC, MDRI and IMF beyond-HIPC32 debt relief at completion point, debt dynamics remain 
manageable, assuming moderate new borrowing, largely on concessional terms, and robust GDP 
growth.  While domestic debt is substantial, the inclusion of domestic debt in the analysis does not 
significantly change the overall assessment of Liberia’s debt sustainability. 

A. Introduction 

1. 
The external and public sector LIC DSAs presented below are based on the common standard 
LIC DSA framework33, with some modifications to the stress tests to address data limitations in Liberia 
and the potential for domestic debt contingent liabilities to be realized.34  The DSAs present the 
projected path of Liberia’s external and public sector debt burden indicators, and draw some 
conclusions on the forward-looking sustainability of debt. Methodologically, the LIC DSA differs from 
the HIPC Debt Relief Analysis (DRA) in that it compares the evolution over the projection period of 
debt-burden indicators (based on single-year denominators) against policy-dependent indicative 
thresholds. In contrast, under a HIPC DRA, the debt burden indicators (based on three-year backward-
looking averages of denominators) are compared to uniform thresholds in order to evaluate eligibility 
or to calculate HIPC debt relief as of a historical reference date.35 

30  These DSAs have been produced jointly by the World Bank and Fund staffs. Liberia ’s fiscal year runs from July 1-June 
30. 

31  Liberia has not yet been rated under the World Bank ’s C ountry Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA).  However, 
for the purposes of this analysis, the staff ’s have conser vatively assumed a weak policy rating (without prejudicing any 
future CPIA assessment).  Accordingly, the corresponding indicative thresholds for the external LIC DSA are 30 percent 
for the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio, 100 percent for the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio, and 15 percent for the debt service-to-
exports ratio.  See “Operational Framework for Debt Sust ainability Assessments in Low-Income Countries —Further 
Considerations ” (http://www.imf.org/External/np/pp/eng/ 2005/032805.htm and IDA/R2005-0056, 3/28/05) and “Applying 
the Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries Post Debt Relief ”, (SM/06/364 and IDA/SecM2006-0564, 
8/11/06).  Assuming a more favorable CPIA rating of “medium ”
 would not change the substance of the external LIC DSA 
analysis. 
32  Liberia ’s debt to the IMF under the 3-year PRGF/EFF will not be covered by MDRI since it will be contracted after the 
end-2004 MDRI cutoff date.  “Beyond-HIPC ” debt relief refers to the assistance necessary to reduce the value of the stock 
of qualifying debt to zero. 
33  See “Debt Sustainability in Low-Income Countries:  Pr oposal for an Operational Framework and Policy Implications ” 
(http://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/sustain/2004/020304.htm and IDA/SECM2004/0035, 2/3/04) and “Debt Sustainability 
in Low-Income Countries:  Further Considerations on an Operational Framework, Policy Implications ” 
(http://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/sustain/2004/091004.htm and IDA/SECM2004/0629, 9/10/04) and “Applying the Debt 
Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries Post Debt Relief ”, (SM/06/364 and IDA/SecM2006-0564, 8/11/06). 
34  On the historical averages for the stress tests, average GDP growth is calculated using data from 1961-1980 which 
excludes significant volatility during the last 25 years due to political instability; the historical averages for some of the 
other key variables are taken over different subsets of the last 10 years due to the poor quality of data.  Also, as noted in 
“Liberia: Enhanced Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor C ountries – Preliminary Document ”, Annex II (Country Report 
No. 08/53), service exports for Liberia were estimated using data from comparator countries, as was done for the HIPC 
DRA. 
35  In addition, the results of the LIC DSA differ from the HIPC DRA because of two other methodological differences 
related to the definition of:  (i) discount rates; and (ii) exchange rates.

B. Baseline Scenario 

2. 
The baseline scenario relies on the same long-run macroeconomic framework as that 
underlying the HIPC DRA and is consistent with the program projections under the PRGF/EFF 
arrangements.  Average annual real GDP growth is projected to moderate over the projection period, 
from 10.5 percent in 2007/08–2012/13 to the long-run average of 3¾ percent in 2013/14–2026/27. 
This pattern reflects the projected decrease in foreign direct investment (FDI)-to-GDP ratio from short- 
to medium-term exceptional levels above 30 percent, to a still significant, yet markedly lower, long-
term level of about 7 percent.36 While direct donor-financed reconstruction and investment is expected 
to remain an important factor supporting growth over the medium term, it is expected to decline 
gradually over the long term as a share of GDP. The ratios of key macroeconomic variables (for 
example, government revenues, current account deficit and FDI) to GDP may be overstated due to the 
probable underestimation of GDP owing to the absence of official national accounts data following the 
destruction of Liberia’s statistical capacity during the civil war. 

3. 
Liberia is assumed to exercise continued fiscal discipline resulting in limited borrowing over 
the medium to long term. It is assumed that the government will continue with the cash-based balanced 
budget until reaching completion point. The projection then assumes borrowing in 2010/11 to fund 
fiscal deficits (including grants) of 1.5 percent of GDP in the initial year, and 3 percent of GDP per 
year for the rest of the projection period. Two thirds of the deficit in each year is assumed to be 
financed by concessional external debt and the remainder by local currency domestic debt. Underlying 
this, revenues are assumed to increase gradually from 24 percent of GDP in 2007/08 to their long-term 
level of 27½ percent of GDP (28.6 percent of GDP, including grants) in 2012/13. Expenditures, 
excluding debt servicing due which is financed by HIPC assistance, are expected to peak at their long-
run level of 31.6 percent of GDP in 2012/13. 

4. 
Under the assumption that FDI and donor flows continue to be robust over the medium term, 
the external position is projected to remain manageable. Over the longer term, the current account 
deficit (excluding grants) is projected to decrease gradually as a percentage of GDP from about 69 
percent in 2006/07 to around 23 percent in 2026/27.  External grants and FDI are expected to remain 
the predominant form of financing, but decreasing as a percentage of GDP from 42 percent in 2006/07 
to around 19 percent in 2026/27.  As official transfers and FDI taper off as a percent of GDP, the 
current account deficit (including grants) is expected to decline gradually to just below 11 percent of 
GDP by the end of the projection period, matching the gradual fall in the trade deficit as a percentage 
of GDP as the impact of continuous FDI is fully reflected in export growth.  Income growth and 
improved financial intermediation are expected to stimulate private sector savings and result in a 
narrowing of the private sector savings-investment deficit in the long term. 

5. 
The baseline scenario assumes full delivery of traditional debt relief, multilateral arrears 
clearance and interim HIPC assistance.37  In addition, a financing gap is assumed to be met through 

36  FDI-related imports are assumed to represent about 85 percent of FDI over the projection period. 
37  The stock of external debt at end- 2007/08 reflects large up-front borrowing from the IMF to clear arrears to the IMF, as 
well as other reschedulings, and fully grant-financed clearance of World Bank and African Development Bank arrears.  

86

 
 
 
 
                                                 
additional voluntary interim-period assistance beyond-HIPC Initiative relief, as detailed in the decision 
point document. Consistent with LIC DSA guidelines, the baseline does not reflect the delivery of 
HIPC, MDRI and IMF beyond-HIPC assistance at the completion point; however, this is presented in 
an alternative scenario.38 

C. Debt Sustainability Analyses 

External Debt Sustainability 

6. 
The baseline scenario, which assumes full delivery of traditional debt relief and a financing gap 
to be met, in part, through HIPC interim assistance, indicates that Liberia is in debt distress (Table 1a, 
Figure 1).  The NPV of external debt-to-GDP ratio remains well above the threshold (30 percent), 
while the NPV of external debt-to-exports ratio moves below the 100 percent threshold by 2016/17, 
reflecting the cumulative effect of FDI on exports.  The debt service ratios (to export and revenue) 
become manageable after 2018/19 reflecting the high degree of concessionality of the outstanding 
stock of debt owed to multilateral (mainly on IDA or IDA-like terms) and bilateral creditors.  
However, Liberia’s debt service ratios are above their respective thresholds (15 percent for exports and 
25 percent for revenues) during 2011/12 to 2017/18, due mainly to payments associated with the 
PRGF/EFF arrangements. 

7. 
The alternative scenarios and bound tests indicate that the evolution of Liberia’s external debt 
position is subject to considerable vulnerabilities and highlight the importance of debt relief (Table 1b, 
Figure 1).  In particular, most debt indicators deteriorate significantly under the bound tests (temporary 
shocks).  Nevertheless, since Liberia ’s new borrowing is assumed to be moderate and largely on highly 
concessional terms, a permanent (unfavorable) shock to the terms of new borrowing will not result in a 
drastic deterioration of debt indicators.  However, given Liberia’s development needs, any 
deterioration in the debt ratios will make meeting its spending priorities substantially more difficult.  

8. 
Debt relief through HIPC Initiative, MDRI and IMF beyond-HIPC assistance and possible 
bilateral and multilateral beyond-HIPC interim-period assistance, would significantly improve 
Liberia’s debt situation.  Assuming the full delivery of such assistance at completion point, all three 
debt-burden indicators (NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio, NPV of debt-to-exports ratio, and debt service-to-
exports ratio) would be significantly below their indicative thresholds. 

Public Sector Debt Sustainability 

9. 
Under the baseline scenario, Liberia ’s public debt (including domestic debt) is expected to 
decline steadily as a percentage of GDP throughout the projection period (Table 2a, Figure 2).  In the 
first few years of the projection, the steady fall in the debt-to-GDP ratio is largely driven by strong 
GDP growth and assumed moderate borrowing.  In the outer years, borrowing remains moderate and 
GDP growth of 3¾ percent is robust enough to continue contributing to the decline in the ratio. 

38  See “Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the Join t Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income 
Countries ” (www.imf.org and IDA/SECM2007/0226, 03/05/2007).

10. 
Domestic debt does not play a significant role in public debt dynamics.  While the stock of 
domestic debt at the beginning of the projection period is substantial at around 40 percent of GDP, it 
has been restructured on concessional terms consistent with the government’s domestic debt strategy, 
and new domestic borrowing, assumed to commence after the completion point, averages 1 percent of 
GDP.39  

11. 
The various stress tests indicate that Liberia ’s public debt dynamic is most vulnerable to GDP 
shocks (Table 2b, Figure 2).  Although the one-time 30 percent depreciation shock in 2008/09 (bound 
test B4) has a large adverse impact on debt dynamics, it should be interpreted cautiously, given that 
currently about 95 percent of government revenues are collected in U.S. dollars.40  The DSA also 
shows that the inclusion of part of domestic claims which are currently classified as “contestable” 
following the government ’s vetting of domestic debt claims (bound test B5) would increase the debt 
stock in 2008/09, but not affect debt ratios significantly over the long term.41 

D. Debt Distress Classification and Conclusion 

12. 
The low-income country debt sustainability analysis reveals that Liberia is in debt 
distress. Under the baseline scenario, external debt burden indicators remain well above their 
indicative thresholds.  This emphasizes the need for debt relief. Debt relief under the HIPC Initiative, 
MDRI and beyond-HIPC assistance significantly improve Liberia ’s external debt situation and bring 
Liberia’s debt indicators to a manageable level. 

13. 
Alternative scenarios and bound tests indicate that the evolution of Liberia’s external debt 
position is subject to vulnerabilities.  The achievement of a robust external debt position will depend 
on real GDP growth, export and revenue performance as well as prudent debt management.  The 
inclusion of domestic debt in the analysis does not significantly change the overall assessment of 
Liberia’s debt sustainability. 

39  Debt owed to the Central Bank of Liberia represents over 90 percent of the total domestic debt at end-June 2007 and was 
rescheduled on concessional terms with a 30 year maturity, 10 year grace period on principal, and interest rates increasing 
from 1.0 percent at the start of the repayment period to 2.5 percent for the latter part of the period. 
40  If Liberia were to start collecting a greater portion of revenues in Liberian dollars, resulting in a greater mismatch on the 
government ’s balance sheet, the implications of this scenario would become more important. 
41 The outcome of the further vetting of approximately $0.3 billion of “contestable ” domestic claims is uncertain due to the 
need to establish the validity of claims and the discount factor, as well as potential legal action on the part of claimants. 
Without prejudging the results of the vetting exercise, the scenario assumes that the discounted value of claims will be 10 
percent of GDP (approximately $80 million).

Annex 15:  CAS Consultations 

A consultation mission with stakeholders at the government and community levels was carried out in 
June 2008 to discuss and validate the joint strategic directions and markers for success of the Bank and 
AfDB.  This mission was built on the government’s comprehensive consultations held in 2007/08 in 15 
counties in Liberia as a part of the development and validation process for the Poverty Reduction 
Strategy.  The team met with and presented the proposed program covering the period of the PRS to 
key government officials, donors and partners, and civil society (local and international NGOs).  

The main purpose of the consultations was to receive feedback from the different stakeholders on 
whether the proposed programs of the Bank and AfDB are aligned with the priorities of the PRS and to 
determine if more should be done and by whom.  Through this exercise, it was evident that there is 
harmonization and coordination among the donors and development partners as well as in the NGO 
community.  However, these stakeholders face many challenges and difficulties ahead in the 
achievement of their respective development goals and objectives in Liberia.  For instance, the need 
for capacity building was emphasized repeatedly by all stakeholders.     

On the government side, the team met with the Minister of Finance, Minister of Agriculture, Minister 
of Land, Mines and Energy, Minister of Public Works and the Advisor to the President from the 
LRDC.  The following is a summary of the consultations with the government: 

• Ministry of Finance:  The Minister pointed out that the CAS must signal full alignment with the 
PRS to the donors.  Infrastructure is a high priority of the PRS because Liberia cannot achieve 
shared growth without this.  The Bank should do as much in infrastructure as possible and that the 
AfDB should link agriculture with roads.  However, despite the emphasis on these sectors, there 
should also be focus on budget support.  As the government does better, the Bank and AfDB 
should increase budget support, retain objectivity while signaling willingness to take risks to the 
rest of the donor community.  The CAS should also have heavy focus on implementation and 
impact on the ground.  And through non-lending activities or TAs, the government will continue to 
demonstrate leadership in structural policies issues, e.g., DTIS.  The role of the PFMU should be 
reviewed and phased-out in 3 years as the government develops more capacity.   

• 

 Ministry of Agriculture:  The Minister summarized the basic challenges affecting the sector in a 
post-conflict setting – (i) low yield and productivity which are mainly due to the quality of seeds, 
lack of fertilizers and pest management issues; and (ii) deterioration of capacity in the research 
institute.  Research was decimated as a result of almost 2 decades of war.  The market system is 
weak because of low rural demand and lack of access to markets.  The entire system needs 
improvements and the need for specialists and scientists is urgent.  Through the assistance of the 
Chinese government, FAO and WFP, in 2 years, the production of rice and cassava doubled but it 
is still below pre-war level.   

What can be done as a short-term emergency response in the context of the PRS?  The Minister 
enumerated the priorities: 

a) Soil and Water Management – Liberia is blessed with water yet the population still has no 
access to it.  The irrigation system needs to be improved. 
b) Planting Material – This is fundamental.  High quality equals high yield.   

89

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
c) Rubber Plantation – Even during the war, these plantations continued to operate.  However, 
there has been no replanting during the last 15 – 20 years thus, the inventory is old. 
d) Oil Palm – There is tremendous interest for this product.  Maybe in 10 years, Liberia will 
be a big exporter.   
e) Cocoa – There is more interest in cocoa than in coffee.  As a result, the US is funding 
sustainable tree crop program. 
f) Coffee – Tree stock is old and needs to be rebuilt.  There is also a need to reinvest in seed. 
g) Low wages in the Agriculture Sector – The earning scale in the sector needs to be improved 
in order to attract new farmers and old farmers to return to farming.  Community-based 
facilities should be made available for the use of the public.   

Where are interventions needed? 

a) Focus on planting materials in food (rice, cassava and vegetables) and cash crops (rubber, 
oil palm, cocoa and coffee); 
b) Review storage processing areas; and  
c) Improve the institution through capacity building.  Improve the skills of farmers by 
providing them with training.   

• Ministry of Land, Mines and Energy:  The Minister indicated that the government is working with 
Arcelor Mittal on a 200 MW power plant project in Buchanan.  There is also a need for 
transmission line with 20-50 MW of power in the interim of the hydropower interconnection 
through the WAPP. 

• Ministry of Public Works and Ministry of Transport:  The Minister named the 5 priorities in terms 
of roads work – Monrovia Streets, Cotton Tree, Small Bridges, Monrovia Ganta and Sealing.  The 
team brought up the issue of maintenance and the need for an appropriate, institutional set-up and 
financing mechanism.  The contractor is responsible for the maintenance of the roads.  The 
Minister also expressed that the procurement process of the WB is complicated to which the team 
responded that these are institutional guidelines which have to be followed.   

• LRDC:  The Advisor to the President indicated that the government is still building the foundation 
in Liberia.  In order to meet the priorities of the PRS, all sectors in the matrix need to have a 
dialogue as a group to have an understanding of what they want and can achieve realistically given 
the constraints.  The Bank and AfDB have the resources, capacity and reach and therefore the need 
to leverage is vital.     

With respect to donors, the team met with major players in Monrovia.  Representatives from the 
following organizations were able to attend the meeting:  EC, FAO, IMF, USAID, UNICEF and WFP.  
With such broad and complex programs, the team expressed to the donors that in order to achieve the 
goals and objectives of the PRS, there has to be harmonization, collaboration and synergism in the 
partnerships and therefore constant dialogue and leveraging of resources and skills are necessary.  
Pooling of funds, more importantly, the MDTF which the Bank is coordinating will bring donors 
together.  The following are the key messages from the donors: 

• The donors support focusing of efforts because there is so much to do and each donor as a 
single entity cannot do everything.  The group has to work closely together to complement each 
other, continue the dialogue and remain to be engaged.  (USAID) 

90

 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
• Use comparative advantage in aligning with the PRS.  Align with the other donors and not to 
duplicate each other.  Land issue is emerging and needs a lot of technical work, e.g., how to 
issue land registry for land ownership.  The Bank and AfDB have a lot of experience in this 
area and can provide TA.  The group should also think about Liberia’s exit from GMAP and 
aim at financial management.  (IMF)   
• Those donors who bring in small financing compared with the others can contribute TAs. 
(FAO) 
• The Bank should provide some financing in social sectors to build confidence of other donors. 
The Bank should make sure to work with all sectors. (UNICEF)   
• The donors should participate in joint program initiatives.  (WFP) 

On the side of civil society, 2 separate consultations were held – one with the Management Steering 
Group (MSG) and one with the local NGOs.  19 organizations were represented during the meeting 
with the MSG to which the team expressed that they will be consulted annually at the minimum.  The 
following is a summary of concerns and discussions: 

• What can be done to help farmers increase rice production?  What is their incentive?  Is there 
training available for farmers?  What about storage for farmers?  The team responded to these 
issues by naming the programs the Bank and AfDB are involved with.  To increase rice 
production, AfDB’s NERICA program can help.  As for the storage issue, the Bank is already 
addressing this through the DTIS which looks at the chain.  The AIDP is designed mainly for 
cash crops and responded rapidly with US$3m food crisis funding.  Another US$3m food crisis 
funding for nutrition in vulnerable areas was approved. 
• Liberia is interested in growing more rubber due to the Firestone phenomenon.  Can this 
success be transferred to rice? 
• There are no roads in the SE, hence there is no agriculture because farmers cannot mobilize 
their produce. 
• The situation in Monrovia with regards to urban squatters is becoming worse.  Urban planning 
is necessary in order not to lose investors.  There has to be a shift in aid that from humanitarian 
to development.  If this issue is not addressed, the progress achieved today could be destroyed 
by an unfortunate humanitarian crisis. 
If pillars are not done right, all donors, all of civil society will be out of Liberia. 

• 

Another meeting was organized in the offices of NARDA, a group which coordinates civil society at 
the local community level.  A total of 22 participants attended representing their respective 
organizations.  After the team explained to the group their roles and the programs in support of the 
PRS, several questions and clarifications were raised: 

• 

It was evident that the development of the Agriculture Sector is a priority to some members of 
the group.  The team was asked to clarify what the Bank will be doing and whether the AfDB ’s 
NERICA program is the only program addressing this issue.   
• NARDA representative asked if there can be a recommendation as to which organization is 
capable.  Another asked how grants are monitored to which the team explained that these are 
done through monitoring and evaluation systems, mid-term reviews, audits and review of the 
results matrix.  These questions were clear signs of mistrust in government. 
• Other representatives asked if the team is thinking of health, sanitation and water management 
to which the team responded by enumerating the projects each is already involved with. 

91

 
 
 
 
 
 
• Another NGO asked how they can participate and access grants.  The team explained that as 
local NGOs, they act as service providers to the different sectors they work with.  They can 
participate by providing bids in order to engage in contracts. 
• Capacity building or in general training for Liberians was brought up.  One asked that as 
expatriates come and go, is there any plan for a sustainable training program.

42 When a member has overdue financial obligations outstanding for more than three months, the amount of such arrears 
will be shown in this section. 
43 This schedule represents all currently scheduled payments to the IMF, including repayment expectations and repayment 
obligations. The IMF Executive Board can extend repayment expectations (within predetermined limits) upon request by 
the debtor country if its external payments position is not strong enough to meet the expectations without undue hardship or 
risk. 
44 This schedule is not the currently applicable schedule of payments to the IMF. Rather, the schedule presents all payments 
to the IMF under the illustrative assumption that repayment expectations – except for SRF repayment expectations – would 
be extended to their respective obligation dates by the IMF Executive Board upon request of the debtor country. SRF 
repayments are thus only shown on their current expectation dates, unless already converted to an obligation date by the 
IMF Executive Board.

IX. Safeguards Assessment 

An update safeguards assessment of the Central Bank of Liberia (CBL) was completed in August 
2008. The update found that while the CBL had largely addressed the measures to increase 
transparency recommended by the 2007 interim safeguards assessment, significant risks exist in the 
control framework of the bank. Of particular concern during the course of the assessment was a delay 
in the assumption of co–signing authority for CBL financial matters by the Fund-supported Special 
Advisor. The assessment also found that internal audit capacity was weak and that the Audit 
Committee was not exercising effective oversight of CBL financial reporting, audit, and control 
systems. A priority measure to utilize the services of an external auditor to conduct a series of special 
audits was completed in August 2008 and it indicated that the monetary data submitted by the CBL are 
accurate and in compliance with TMU definitions, and that progress has been made to improve some 
aspects of the overall control environment, including the assumption of co–signing authority by the 
Special Advisor. The CBL has also made progress 
in 
implementing other safeguards 
recommendations, including drafting investment guidelines for CBL financial resources. 

X. Exchange Rate Arrangement 

Liberia maintains an exchange rate system that is free of restrictions on payments for current and 
capital transfers. The currency of Liberia is the Liberian dollar. The U.S. dollar is also legal tender. 
The current exchange rate arrangement is a managed float, with no predetermined path for the 
exchange rate. The exchange rate of the Liberian dollar is market determined, and all foreign exchange 
dealers, including banks, are permitted to buy and sell currencies. Liberia’s exchange rate at 
end-January 2009 was L$64.5=US$1. 

XI. Article IV Consultation 

The 2008 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Monrovia during October 20-31, 2008 in 
Monrovia. The staff report (Country Report No. 09/4, 1/13/09) was discussed by the Executive Board 
on December 22, 2008 and is posted on the IMF website.
