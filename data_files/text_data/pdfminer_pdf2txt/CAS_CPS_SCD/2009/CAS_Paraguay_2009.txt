EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

The v ic to ry o f Fernando Lugo , a fo rme r Ca tho l ic bishop, in the p res iden t ia l elections o f 
April 20, 2008 ended 61 years o f Co lo rado Party dominance. President Lug0 heads a 
cen te r - le f t coa l i t ion , the Alianza Pa ra e l Cambio (APC), consisting o f a wide array o f 
p o l i t i c a l organizations with a b road ideo log ica l base and o rgan iza t iona l capacity. 
President Lugo ’s v i c t o r y p resen ts an h is to r ica l opportunity for Paraguay t o address 
longs tand ing governance, social and economic challenges and im p r o v e the l iv ing 
standards o f i t s popu la t ion . Since this i s the first time in recent h is to ry tha t there i s an 
a l te rna t ion o f powe r in Paraguay, the A P C faces impo r tan t challenges in hand l ing an 
adm in is t ra t ion that has responded f o r some 60 years t o the interests o f a single p o l i t i c a l 
t rad i t ion . 

O n the economic front, be tween the years 2004 and 2008 Paraguay experienced i t s 
strongest economic expansion since the 1970s. GD P grew b y 4.3 percent in 2006, b y 6.8 
percent in 2007 but s lowed d o w n t o 5.8 percent in 2008 due t o the g loba l econom ic crisis. 
This strong economic pe r fo rmance resulted in a decline in ove ra l l pove r ty leve ls , f r o m 
46.4 percent in 2002 t o 35.6 percent in 2007. Ex t reme pove r t y has also f a l l e n f r o m 21.7 
percent t o 19.4 percent during the same period, a l though i t increased between 2006 and 
2007 due t o rising f o o d prices and lack o f sp i l love rs f r o m g r ow t h to f o rm a l emp loymen t . 
At the same time, Paraguay has a ve ry unequal d is t r ibu t ion o f income and assets. F o r 
instance, in Paraguay the richest 10 percent o f the popu la t ion accounts f o r a lmos t h a l f o f 
to ta l income, while 2 percent o f the ag r icu l tu ra l establishments (about 6,400 farms) 
occupy almost 82 percent o f the ag r icu l tu ra l ly exp lo i ted l a n d (namely, 2 0 m i l l i o n o f the 
24 m i l l i o n hectares in ag r icu l tu ra l use, or one -ha l f o f Paraguay’s to ta l area o f 40 m i l l i o n 
hectares). 

The year 2008 started o f f buoyan t ly , but the g loba l c r is is hit in October m a i n l y th rough a 
sharp reduc t ion in trade (commod i ty expo r t orders and p r ices f e l l and there was also a 
sharp reduc t ion in re-exports due t o the depreciation o f the B r a z i l i a n Real) and wo rke rs ’ 
remmittances. The guarani r a p i d l y los t a quarter o f i t s value, and trade-related economic 
a c t i v i t y s lowed d o w n (i.e., a l l ag r icu l tu ra l ac t iv i t ies and the m a j o r i t y o f services i n c l u d i n g 
re-exports). The 
f inanc ia l sector, m o s t l y comp r is ing 
fo re ign -owned banks, has 
strengthened i t s cap i ta l p o s i t i o n over the past years but, as the impac t o f the g loba l 
economic crisis deepens, c red i t qua l i ty m a y deteriorate due t o a s l ow d o w n in the rea l 
sector. The ou t look f o r 2009 and beyond i s very unce r ta in due t o the sharp f a l l in external 
demand f o r ag r icu l tu ra l products, possible further declines in c omm o d i t y prices, domestic 
uncertainty, and the impac t o f these developments o n revenue co l lec t ion . Howeve r , the 
authorities’ Medium Term Mac roeconom ic F ramewo rk i s appropriate, and includes f isca l 
measures equivalent t o about 2 percent o f GD P this year t o buffer the economy f r o m the 
g loba l s lowdown . 

O n the social front, the adm in is t ra t ion inhe r i ted a back log in social services due t o a 
comb ina t ion o f lack o f funds and weak state institutions, w h i c h has resulted in l o w 
standards o f p r o v i s i o n o f basic services. 
In the water and sanitation area, about 61 
percent o f the popu la t ion has access t o d r inkab le water (on ly 49 percent in ru ra l areas), 
w h i l e o n l y 8 percent o f the p o p u l a t i o n has access t o ne two rk sanitation. O n the education 

1 

front, participation rates are among the lowest in L a t i n America (especially in secondary 
education where desertion rates are high). The health sector i s confronted w i t h very h igh 
maternal mo r ta l i ty rates, wh i le according to W o r l d Health Organization (WHO), 39 
percent o f the population does not have access to health se rv ices . Addressing these needs 
in a sustainable manner w i l l require not only financial resources but also strengthening 
state institutions that are responsible fo r delivering basic services. 

In the longer term, Paraguay faces the challenge o f d ive rs i fy ing i t s economy away f rom 
commodity exports to provide more rewarding jobs to citizens that today depend on l ow 
paying activities in the rural and in fo rma l sectors. 
In addition, Paraguay needs to 
strengthen the ab i l i ty o f the State to provide social and economic services b y collecting 
additional resources in an equitable and non-distortionary manner. 

The Lug0 administration has developed a program fo r Paraguay to transition to a modern 
economy based on imp rov ing governance and reducing corruption, addressing the needs 
o f vulnerable groups and restoring growth in l i g h t o f the global c r i s is . The elements o f 
the Government’s program a re embodied in the M in is t ry o f Finance Economic and Social 
Plan for 2008-2013 and in the recently announced An t i -C r is is Strategy. Three major 
cross -cu t t ing and inter-related themes -governance, poverty and growth - emerge f rom 
the Plan, and c lea r measures and objectives have been identified fo r each o f these themes. 
The Bank concurs w i t h the Government’s assessment o f the challenges ahead and has 
developed the proposed Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) to support the Government’s 
objectives in each o f the cross-cutting themes w i t h spec i f ic interventions as follows: 

Governance. The Bank intends to increase i t s assistance to Paraguay in the 
governance area, wh ich i s consistent w i t h the utmost p r io r i ty the authorities have 
assigned to this area, as we l l as w i t h the recent selection o f Paraguay as a p i l o t for the 
implementation o f the Bank’s Governance and Anticorruption (GAC) Strategy. In 
particular, the Bank w i l l assist the authorities in obtaining concrete results in their 
anticorruption drive b y supporting their adherence to the WB /UNODC Stolen Asset 
Recovery In i t ia t ive (StAR). The Bank w i l l further support efforts by the authorities to 
increase the effectiveness o f public investments, b y assisting w i t h the development 
and implementation o f a governance framework for a l l Bank projects. Very 
importantly, the Bank w i l l support the Government’s objective to initiate a sustainable 
process for bu i ld ing state institutions through a se r ies o f programmatic Development 
Po l icy Loans (DPL) focusing on imp rov ing accountability o f public enterprises, 
in i t ia t ing c i v i l s e r v i c e reform, and strengthening the internal control system for the 
public administration. 

Poverty. In close collaboration w i t h other donors, the Bank w i l l support the 
authorities to: (i) enhance social safety ne ts through non lending activities that could 
be fo l lowed b y an investment operation; (ii) develop participatory mechanisms for 
land reform through an investment project; (iii) improve the quality o f secondary 
education and establishing a scholarship program fo r Paraguayans to receive 
education abroad to improve the quality o f future c i v i l servants and leaders through 
lending; (iv) expand the coverage o f water supply and sanitation through the recently 
approved Water and Sanitation Modernization Project; (v) reduce vulnerabilities for 
the rural poor through the Sustainable Rural Development Project; and (v i ) expand 

11 

community-based activities to cover the poorest 40 d is t r ic ts and vulnerable 
populations in metropolitan Asuncion through an Add i t iona l Financing fo r the 
Community Development Project. In addition, the D P L programmatic s e r i e s w i l l 
include a component to help safeguard and imp rove key social programs. 

Growth and Environment. To help mitigate the e f f e c t s o f the global crisis on the 
economy and the poor, the Bank w i l l provide quick disbursing funds through the 
proposed DPLs. 
In addition, the Bank w i l l help Paraguay make better use o f i t s 
valuable hydroelectric assets perhaps through an investment project to expand the 
power transmission grid. The IFC w i l l seek opportunities to engage w i t h the private 
sector in transport, financial services and, more broadly, in supporting sma l l and 
medium en te rp r ises inc lud ing through technical assistance to reduce barriers to doing 
business. In addition, the Bank w i l l support Government’s efforts to better define the 
longer term growth and diversification agenda through analytical wo rk and non- 
reimbursable T A . 

The new administration and i t s shared v is ion offer an historic opportunity fo r the 
international community to engage more deeply with Paraguay and contribute to ach ieve 
the country’s development goals. Wh i le carefully mon i to r ing the underlying risks, the 
Bank and the IFC w i l l aim at stepping up their involvement in Paraguay under the CPS, 
bo th w i t h lending and non-lending activities. The overall support wou ld be selective, Le., 
focused on a few projects in areas where the W o r l d Bank has clear advantage and 
expertise, and where proven implementation capacity exist. The Bank w i l l wo rk closely 
w i t h others in the international community, as i t w i l l continue to be a m ino r player in 
Paraguay. 

The CPS provides for an indicative lending envelope o f US$500 m i l l i o n over the f ive 
year pe r iod through FY13 . This amount implies a moderate increase in Bank exposure, 
wh ich i s jus t i f ied b y the challenges the country i s facing and b y the strategic role the 
Bank has been called upon to play in helping Paraguay achieve progress in the agreed 
focus areas. The proposed program w i l l be front loaded, w i t h about fo r ty percent o f the 
indicative envelope devoted to programmatic development po l i cy lending and an 
additional 13 percent in pre-identified investment lending. This w i l l help protect delivery 
o f basic s e r v i c e s to vulnerable populations and infrastructure investment f rom the adverse 
impact o f the global f inanc ia l c r i s i s . The remainder o f the Bank’s indicative lending 
program has not been pre-identified, so as to maintain f lex ib i l i t y during implementation 
given the overall country and program risks, the changing nature o f Paraguay’s needs, 
and the unce r ta in t ies surrounding the global financial c r i s i s . There is , however, an 
ongoing dialogue between the Bank and the authorities concerning possible lending for 
financing safety ne ts and electricity. 

The indicative envelope w i l l be reviewed at the time o f the CPS Progress Report, taking 
in to account the level o f absorption and implementation capacity, the Government’s 
ab i l i ty to maintain a sound macroeconomic framework, the progress made in the 
governance, poverty and growth agenda and the Bank’s lending capacity at that time. 
The CPS Progress Report w i l l hence provide an opportunity to carry out a comprehensive 
assessment o f the progress achieved in CPS implementation and reassess priorities.

There are a number o f imp lemen ta t ion challenges f o r the Government’s P rog ram that 
c o u l d put the CPS imp lemen ta t ion at r i s k : 

Creating a legislative consensus on the development agenda. Since the A P C lacks a 
m a j o r i t y in Congress, the authorities w i l l need to make a special e f f o r t t o forge a 
consensus beyond i t s constituency t o ensure that i t s economic and social agenda has 
leg is la t ive back ing . Since in Paraguay, Gove rnmen t implemented grants and loans 
have t o be i n d i v i d u a l l y approved by Congress outside the budget process, such 
consensus shou ld also encompass a po l i t ica l agreement o n the r o l e o f external 
assistance in suppo r t ing the coun t ry ’s development e f fo r ts . This would a v o i d past 
controversies that b locked the app rova l o f external grants and loans, i n c l u d i n g those 
f r o m the Bank . 

Starting a process to improve key elements of 
the public administration. Since 
imp lemen ta t ion capacity in l i n e ministries and agencies i s weak, t rans fo rm ing p o l i c y 
objectives i n t o concrete outcomes i s a challenge. Planning, f inanc ia l management, 
and m o n i t o r i n g and eva lua t ion capacity across m in is t r ies and agencies needs to be 

strengthened in the short- to medium-term. At the same time, opportunities f o r c i v i l 

society t o oversee, sponsor, o r even implement Government’s ac t iv i t ies w i l l need to 
be further developed. 

An add i t iona l risk re la tes t o Paraguay’s a b i l i t y t o address i t s f rag i le soc ia l situation. 
Despite high economic growth in recent years, Paraguay s t i l l exhibits high levels o f 
exc lus ion and pove r ty . In particular, poor social in f ras t ruc tu re and de f ic ien t p r o v i s i o n o f 
basic services are fueling social tensions. In addition, the high concen t ra t ion o f land 
owne rsh ip has escalated tensions among large landowners and small-scale and landless 
farmers. The p o l i t i c a l t rans i t ion has generated expectations that urgent soc ia l needs w i l l 
be met. There i s a s ign i f ican t r i s k that the authorities m a y n o t be able t o m e e t such 
expectations, thus engendering b road social discontent and even tua l ly e rod ing popu la r 
support f o r the Lug0 Adm in is t ra t ion . 

Mo reove r , the l e s s than favo rab le env i ronmen t presents an impo r tan t challenge f o r 
Paraguay. GD P i s expected t o f a l l in 2009 by -0.5 percent and m a y o n l y recover 
ma rg ina l ly in 2010. Howeve r , the extent and magnitude o f the g loba l f inanc ia l c r is is i s 
s t i l l unknown , and so i s the magn i tude o f i t s impac t o n Paraguay. In this respect, there i s 
a risk that the monetary and f isca l po l ic ies envisaged in the Government’s an t i -c r is is plan 
m a y n o t be su f f ic ien t t o p a r t i a l l y cush ion the economy f r om the impac t o f the crisis. 

The B a n k w i l l ca re fu l ly m o n i t o r the above men t ioned risks (as well as f iduc ia r y and 
p rog ram -spec i f ic risks) w h i l e m o n i t o r i n g the de l ive ry o f expected outcomes under each 
o f the t h r e e cross-cutting themes identified earlier (see Results M a t r i x in A n n e x 1). The 
steps that the authorities expect to take with Bank ’s support, a l though sma l l and specific, 
are expected to help reach a c r i t i c a l t u r n i n g p o i n t in the country’s deve lopmen t agenda.

I. INTRODUCTION 

1. 
The election o f Fernando Lug0 as President o f the Republic presen ts Paraguay 
w i t h an opportunity to tackle more effectively i t s long standing poverty and governance 
i s s u e s . Whether Paraguay w i l l be able to take advantage o f this opportunity w i l l largely 
depend upon Paraguay establishing a broad consensus o n development challenges and 
vision, and the Government’s ab i l i ty to implement change. The Bank’s Country 
Partnership Strategy (CPS) has been developed w i t h the objective o f assisting the new 
authorities weather the global economic c r i s i s and implement reforms that lead to 
tangible r e s u l t s in strategic development areas, w i t h a clear p r io r i ty on i s s u e s pertaining 
to governance, poverty alleviation and growth. The CPS also intends to assist Paraguay 
develop a consensus on the po l icy agenda to address long-standing structural challenges 
through programmatic analytical work and i t s dissemination. The proposed strategy w i l l 
cover the term o f President Lugo, C Y 2009 to C Y 201 3 . Recognizing that Paraguay’s 
economy i s subject to domestic and external shocks, and that the po l i t ica l environment i s 
volatile, the proposed CPS provides an indicative program while i t incorporates 
f lex ib i l i ty to ensure responsiveness to the county’s needs, particularly those derived f rom 
the international financial crisis. 

11. THE COUNTRY CONTEXT 

A. 

POLITICAL CONTEXT 

2. 
The victory o f Fernando Lugo, a former Catholic bishop, in the presidential 
elections o f A p r i l 20, 2008 ended 61 years o f Colorado Party dominance. W i t h a margin 
o f 10 percentage points above the Colorado candidate, the v ic to ry gave President Lug0 
and his movement strong legitimacy. His reputation as an anti-corruption champion and 
his l i fe - long commitment to the poor confer President Lug0 a strong moral authority. 

3. 
President Lug0 heads a cen te r - le f t coalition, the Alianza Para e l Cambio (APC), 
wh ich includes one ma in po l i t ica l party (the Liberals), th ree m ino r ones, and about one 
dozen po l i t ica l movements that span a wide range o f ideologies. D e s p i t e the range o f 
po l i t ica l views, the coa l i t ion shares key priorities that include a deep commitment to 
improve governance and government institutions and to reduce corruption, to improve the 
livelihoods and opportunities for the poor in a sustainable fashion, t o strengthen the 
management o f the country’s vast hydroelectric resources, and to consolidate the 
country’s democratic process. The APC has also adopted a pragmatic economic po l icy 
stance based on maintaining sound macroeconomic management and a balanced v iew o f 
the role o f the State, wh i le safeguarding the environment. Lugo’s victory, therefore, 
opens up an opportunity for Paraguay to s t a r t tackling i t s long-standing governance, 
corruption, and poverty i s s u e s .

Wh i le the economy i s l i ke ly to benefit f rom this stance, and f rom reduced levels 
o f corruption, significant economic po l icy reforms may be slow in materializing. This i s 
not only because addressing the backlog o f needed structural re fo rms i s a daunting task in

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK 

Econom ic Recovery (2003-2007) 

5 . 

Over the past four years, Paraguay experienced its biggest economic 
expansion since the 1970s. Paraguay went th rough a period o f economic stagnation in 
the late 1990s and ea r ly 2000s, as a r e s u l t o f t e r m s o f trade shocks, a domestic banking 
c r is is and the economic turbulence in the Southern Cone. Be tween 2003 and 2005, 
supported b y a successful s tab i l iza t ion program, the mac roeconom ic s i tua t ion turned 
around, with g r ow t h averaging 3.6 percent during this pe r iod . G r ow t h momentum 
con t inued in la te r years, supported by a favorable ex te rna l env i ronmen t and con t inua t ion 
o f sound economic po l ic ies . GDP grew by 4.3 percent in 2006 and by an exuberant 6.8 
percent in 2007 (Figure 1), and was s e t t o con t inue at a comparable pace in b o t h 2008 and 
2009. 

6. 
The resurgence of growth was driven by agriculture and the r e c o v e r y in 
domestic demand. Between 2003 and 2007 ag r icu l tu ra l p roduc t ion g rew 7 percent per 
year o n average. Re la ted sectors, such as b e e f processing (accounted 
f o r under 
manu fac tu r ing ) were also ve ry dynamic, advanc ing 6 percent o n average during the same 
period. While these sectors were driven m a i n l y by the upsurge in commod i ty prices, 
p r o d u c t i v i t y gains also p layed a r o l e - e v e n in the l ives tock sector which has t rad i t iona l ly 
been based on extensive practices. A l s o dynam ic were assembling industries and 
communications, w h i c h grew o n average mo re than 8 percent each du r ing the pe r iod . 
And with free p r iva te sector entry i n t o po r ts and shipments, log is t ics also started t o catch 
up, a l though la rge oppo r tun i t ies rema in f o r further e f f ic iency gains. O n the expenditure 
side, consump t ion g r ow t h accounted f o r 82 percent o f to ta l GD P growth between 2003 
and 2007, with investment accounting f o r the re s t . Investment was pa r t icu la r ly dynam ic 
in the la t te r years o f the pe r iod when i t expanded ve ry sharply. O n the external front, 
im p o r t g r ow t h fully o f fse t expo r t g r ow t h during this pe r iod .

Prudent fiscal management from 2003 through 2007 contributed to the 
recovery. The res to ra t ion o f macroeconomic s tab i l i ty , w h i c h re-established confidence 
and pushed up consumption, was anchored in a tight f isca l stance. But f isca l p o l i c y also 
con t r ibu ted t o recove ry in an ind i rec t manner: tax p o l i c y reforms, coup led with 
imp rovemen ts in tax and customs administrations, brought about an impo r tan t f i r s t wave

o f economic fo rma l iza t ion . W h i l e tax revenues rema in s ign i f ican t ly b e l ow comparable 
middle income countries, these re fo rms supported a s tab i l iza t ion o f revenues around 18 
percent o f GDP . Since the l e v e l o f p r im a r y spending was ma in ta ined at about 16-17 
percent o f GDP, i t was possible to achieve an average p r im a r y surplus o f 2 percent o f 
GDP . M o s t state-owned enterprises (SOEs) were also kept under a s t r ic t budget 
constraint2 (Figure 2), a l though that was achieved primarily th rough cuts in investment 
rather than in recurrent spending. The resulting ove ra l l f isca l surplus f o r the consolidated 
government was about 1 percent o f GD P f o r the 2004-07 pe r iod .

Public debt levels are low . Sound f isca l policies, l ow e r in te re s t rates, higher

o f Paraguay (BCP), decreased r a p i d l y f r o m 59 percent o f GDP in 2002 to around 30 
percent in 2007.3 The interest rate p r o f i l e o f central government ex te rna l debt i s h i g h l y 
favorable: 33 percent has a f i x e d i n t e r e s t rate (most o f i t at 3 percent o r less), while the 
remaining two-thirds that carries va r iab le in te re s t rates i s ow e d t o mu l t i la te ra l and

This i s the case for instance o f commerce i n informatics, a key activity in Ciudad del Este (the country’s 
second largest city and a well known center for intermediating goods from abroad mainly to the more 
protected market o f Brazil under a legal tourist regime). 
An exception to this i s PETROPAR, the state-owned petroleum company, which has run up a significant 
stock o f commercial debt due to subsidization o f diesel fuel consumption. 
While the government’s debt has been falling rapidly in recent years, the Central Bank accumulated debt 
through the issuance o f significant amounts o f sterilization bills. 
Domestic bonds are o f short maturity ( le ss than 3 years) and are primarily bought by domestic banks. 
The CBPY does not have a system to register re-exports through Ciudad del Este, and the country’s two 
large hydropower (co-owned with Brazil and Argentina, respectively) are treated as foreign companies. 
These make the BOP (and National Accounts) statistics very unreliable in Paraguay.

between roughly 1 and 2 percen t o f GDP. Paraguay d i d not run large cu r ren t account 
su rp luses when commodity p r i c e s increased in 2006 and 2007 because imports started to 
boom due to strong domestic demand and h igh o i l p r icesS6 The strong r i s e in international 
commodities p r i c e s that began in 2007 resulted in a surge in foreign exchange inflows, 
supported also b y higher levels o f worker's remittances, and b y increased corporate 
social responsibilities and infrastructure spending o f the two hydroelectric plants. These 
put pressure on the guarani to appreciate f rom Gs.5,300/US$ at the end o f 2006 to below 
Gs.4,000/US$ in mid-2008. Between June 2007 and June 2008, the Central Bank 
accumulated US$1 b i l l i o n in international reserves in an e f fo r t to moderate this 
appreciation. 

10. 
Despite progress in recent years, poverty and inequality remain high relative 
to other Latin American countries. Inc idence o f moderate poverty peaked at 46 percent 
in 2002, and has s ince then fallen to 35 .6 percent. Extreme poverty has fallen from 21.7 
to 19.4 percent during the same period (Figure 3). This f a l l suggests that the recen t 
economic growth has been to some extent pro-poor. Despite this positive trend, poverty 
levels are now only back at the levels observed in the la te 1990s, and extreme poverty 
increased between 2005 and 2007. The increase was due to r is ing food p r i c e s and lack o f 
spillovers f rom growth in to poverty, suggesting that poverty i s a structural problem that 
requires a concerted and holistic effort to be addressed effectively. Moreover, the nature 
o f poverty appears to have changed: wh i le moderate poverty used to be a p r ima r i ly rural 
phenomenon, i t has recently become more prevalent in urban areas.' Paraguay also 
s u f f e r s f rom h igh income inequality. A t 0.55, Paraguay's Gini coefficient o f income 
distribution i s the fourth highest in La t in America (Figure 4). The richest 10 percent o f 
the population accounts fo r between 42 and 47 percent o f total income. Similarly, 
inequality in land distribution i s among the highest in the wo r ld . Reducing poverty and 
inequality in a sustained manner thus remains an important challenge, particularly w i t h 
labor market opportunities. * m . . . . ,

11 . 
The year 2008 started o f f buoyantly, but the global c r i s i s hit in October. This 
was ma in ly through a sharp reduction in trade (commodity export orders and p r ices f e l l 
and there was also a sharp reduction in re-exports due t o the depreciation o f the B raz i l ian 
Real) and workers’ remmittances. The guarani rap id ly lost a quarter o f i t s value, and 
trade-related economic activity slowed down (Le,, a l l agricultural activities and the 
ma jo r i ty o f s e r v i c e s inc lud ing re-exports). The financial sector, mostly comprising 
foreign-owned banks, has strengthened i t s capital pos i t ion over the past years but, as the 
impact o f the global economic c r i s i s deepens, credit quality may deteriorate due to a slow 
down in the real sec tor . GDP growth wh ich advanced at rates higher than 7 percent m id - 
year, c losed the year at 5.8 percen t due to the global c r i s i s .

12. 
The administration’s medium-term macroeconomic policy framework i s 
appropriate. The administration i s committed to continue implementing prudent 
macroeconomic policies, and 
focusing on 
fiscal sustainability, 
improved 
competitiveness and equitable growth - as laid out in the Government’s Strategic 
Economic and Social Plan for 2008-13 presented in September 2008. A key objective o f 
the Plan i s to create fiscal space, particularly on the revenue side, to allocate more 
resources to p r io r i ty social and investment programs, especially those aimed at reducing 
poverty. In order to achieve this, the Government i s committed to maintaining in f la t ion 
w i t h i n single digits, gradually increasing tax collections through better administration and 
the introduction o f new taxes, and imp rov ing the efficiency o f public spending. The p lan 
also envisages important reforms to SOEs that wou ld help address the contingent 

l iab i l i t ies that these companies represen t .8 

13. 
At the same time, the l e s s favorable external environment presents an 
important challenge. As a small open economy w i t h limited access to international 
financial markets, Paraguay w i l l be affected b y the ongoing financial c r i s i s p r ima r i ly on 
the real s ide . Fa l l ing commodities prices and a decline in global demand for Paraguay’s 
exports represent the main transmission channels and w i l l especially a f f e c t the agriculture 
sector, a key driver o f growth. Prices fo r soy beans, one o f Paraguay’s ma in exports, 
have already f a l l e n 42 percent s ince their peak in July 2008, and there are indications that 
demand for meat in some o f Paraguay’s ma in export markets has begun to dec l ine . As a 
result, Paraguay’s current account f e l l into d e f i c i t (estimated around 2.2 percent o f GDP) 
in 2008 fo r the first time s ince 2001. The economy w i l l also be affected by the f a l l in 
remittances and foreign direct investment, although the impact i s expected to be l e s s 
pronounced than in the case o f trade.’ 

14. 
The effects o f the financial c r i s i s on Paraguay’s currency have already 
become apparent. M i r r o r i n g the devaluation o f the B raz i l ian rea l as investors fled to 
safety, the guarani depreciated sharply in recen t months. In October the Central Bank 
reversed intervention po l icy course and began to s e l l international reserves in order to

Due to the lack o f audited information and the fact that many liabilities are i n the form o f short-term 
commercial credits, these contingent liabilities cannot currently be reliably quantified. 
I n 2007, remittances (as recorded in the balance o f payments) reached U S 2 0 0 m i l l ion (approximately 2% 
o f GDP), while foreign direct investment amounted to approximately US$240 million.

con ta in the slide in the guarani (F igu re 5). While this in te rven t ion led t o a loss o f US$460 
m i l l i o n in in te rna t iona l rese rves , at US$2 .8 b i l l i o n (or 3.7 mon ths o f impo r ts ) the Cen t ra l 
Bank's fo re ign exchange cush ion remains com fo r tab le and well above h is to r ica l leve l s . 

15 . 
The deterioration in the r e a l sector presents a significant risk f o r the 
financial sector. Since the last bank ing c r i s is in the ea r ly 2000s, the l e v e l o f f inanc ia l 
intermediation has improved, and the b a n k i n g sector i s generally considered t o be sound, 
with an average capital adequacy ra t io well above the regu la to ry f l o o r o f 10 percent." 
D o l l a r i z a t i o n remains h i g h but i s o n a dec l in ing trend: 39 percent o f bank c red i ts t o the 
p r iva te sector are n o w denominated in U S dollars, d o w n f r o m 47 percent in 2005. But 
c red i t grew fast between m id -2007 and end-2008, ra is ing some concerns over the qua l i ty 
o f banks ' c red i t p o r t f o l i o . The expected economic s l ow d ow n w i l l be mo re acute in 
ag r icu l tu re (w h i c h accounts f o r 26 percent o f outstanding bank credit) and the services 
sector. This m a y lead to an increase in non -pe r fo rm ing loans, w h i c h cu r ren t ly account f o r 
1 percent o f banks' loan p o r t f o l i o . P re l im ina ry estimates suggest that banks c o u l d 
w i ths tand a moderate t o s ign i f ican t de te r io ra t ion in their loan p o r t f o l i o . To deal with 
higher c red i t risk, comme rc ia l banks are already reduc ing and becom ing mo re cautious in 
their lending, w h i c h m a y res t r ic t liquidity. 

16. 
The outlook f o r the non-banking financial sector i s uncertain. Cooperatives 
account f o r 30 percent o f to ta l loans in the system and f o r 16 percent o f to ta l deposits, 
and they are interlinked with the b a n k i n g system th rough loans and deposits. Unlike

I n light o f the evident deceleration o f the economy, the Government has

Even though the regulatory floor i s above the Basel minimum o f 8 percent o f risk-weighted assets, i t

Under a baseline scenario, economic growth will fall from an estimated 5.8 
percent in 2008 to -0.5 percent in 2009 , in line with lower global and regional 
economic growth forecasts. On the supply side, the growth reduction w i l l come 
p r ima r i ly f rom a fa l l in agricultural production, caused b y the decrease in soy and other 
agricultural commodity p r ices as we l l as reduced yields due to the ongoing severe 
drought. Ac t iv i ty in other sectors, especially livestock production and re-exports o f 
manufactured goods i s also projected to slow down significantly. On the demand side, 
there w i l l be a significant slowdown in private consumption and investment. In the 
medium te rm , as global g row th recovers, Paraguay i s expected to converge towards a 
long-term growth rate o f 4.5 pe rcen t (Table 2). K e y assumptions fo r this baseline 
scenario are (i) the suc cess fu l implementation o f the Government’s p r io r i ty spending 
programs in 2009 and the maintenance o f higher levels o f public investment; (ii) the 
recovery in global economic g row th beginning in 2010; and (iii) a gradual recovery in 
commodity p r ices . 

19. 
The authorities fo resee running a counter-cyclical fiscal policy to counteract 
the effects o f the c r i s i s . In the short term , tax collections w i l l decrease as a result o f 
lower imports. Revenue f rom V A T on imports, import duties, and excises (representing 
5 5 percent o f to ta l tax revenues) w i l l fa l l , as w i l l corporate income tax revenue f rom 
export and impo r t related activities. Expenditures in 2009 are expected to increase f rom 
the very l ow levels observed in 2008, due to moderate pub l ic sector salary increases, an 
expansion o f social safety net programs and, most importantly, a significant increase in 
capital spending. Even though the public sector’s ab i l i ty to execute non-wage spending, 
particularly investments, remains low, the re i s a backlog o f infrastructure programs 
initiated in 2008 that i s expected to be implemented w i th in the coming months. Overall, 
the base case scenario foresees a primary deficit o f 1 percent o f GDP for 2009 and an 
overall deficit close to 2 percent o f GDP, wh ich w i l l gradually improve as tax revenue 
recovers. A l though Paraguay’s 
fiscal position provides some headroom 
countercyclical fiscal po l icy , the country w i l l need to re ly on an estimated US$300 
m i l l i o n financial package o f support f rom i t s international development partners, 
inc lud ing the Wo r ld Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the Andean 
Development Corporation (CAF) and the Japan International Cooperation Agency 
(JICA), to ensure s u f f i c i e n t resources, especially i f tax revenues are affected more 
strongly than currently expected. The authorities have not requested support f rom the 
IMF, but have agreed to bi-annual A r t i c l e I V missions.

Paraguay’s debt burden and debt servicing indicators a r e manageable under 
reasonable assumptions. Under the baseline scenario, public debt levels w i l l remain 
sustainable. Public debt’* wou ld increase f rom 19.3 percen t o f GDP in 2008 to 22.9 
percent in 2010, and wou ld then gradually fa l l to 19.1 percent b y 2013. Under an 
alternative scenario in wh i ch the primary deficit expected for 2009 i s maintained 
throughout the projection period, debt levels wou ld be higher at 22.5 pe rcen t in 2013. 
Sensitivity analyses suggest that the main vulnerabilities o f Paraguay’s debt position stem 
from l ow growth and a depreciation in the exchange rate, as a large share o f public debt i s

o f banks, financial cooperatives or SOEs - also pose important risks. I f the economy 
grew on average 1.6 percentage points l e s s than under the baseline scenario throughout 
the projection period, debt levels wou ld reach 23.4 pe rcen t b y 2013. A contingent 
l iab i l i ty shock or a 30 percen t real depreciation over the baseline wou ld have a much 
greater impact on debt levels, pushing them up to 29 percent b y the end o f the projection 
period.13

There are important downside risks to the baseline scenario. An even more 
pronounced fa l l in commodity p r ices and a stronger reduction in Paraguay’s agricultural 
production resulting f rom the ongoing drought and/or a credit squeeze wou ld have 
important e f f e c t s on growth. Thus, a s t ress - tes t was performed on the base case w i t h the 
fo l low ing assumptions: (i) commodity p r ices fo r soy f a l l b y an additional 10 percentage 
points in 2009 compared to the baseline scenario and continue depressed in 2010; (ii) 
production o f soy, wheat, corn and meat falls an additional 10 percentage points; (iii) 
remittances f rom Paraguayan workers abroad f a l l b y 50 percent. Under this scenario, to 
the economy wou ld s h r i n k b y 2 percent and the current account d e f i c i t wou ld increase to 
5 percent o f GDP in 2009 and 2010 (Table 3). l 4 The exchange ra te depreciation wou ld be 
even more pronounced than under the baseline scenario. This simulation suggests that 
Paraguay’s vulnerability to external factors i s very high.

STRUCTURAL CHALLENGES 

22. 
Paraguay faces a number o f important long-term developmental challenges wh ich 
the new administration w i l l have to address in order to transform Paraguay in to a 
transparent, equitable and dynamic economy. These challenges broadly relate to th ree 
areas - governance, poverty, and growth and environment. 

l 3 De ta i ls o f th is D S A are inc luded in Annex 6 o f the DPL document. 
l 4 The impac t on the current account i s dampened somewhat because impor ts w i l l f a l l in response to lowe r 
domestic demand.

Governance 

23. 
The p u b l i c sector exh ib i ts s ign i f ican t weaknesses in the fo rmu la t ion and 
imp lemen ta t ion o f p u b l i c po l ic ies as well as in the de l ive ry o f p u b l i c services. U n d e r l y i n g 
these findings i s the fact that Paraguay’s ins t i tu t ions have suffered f r om limited p o l i t i c a l 
compe t i t ion , poo r checks and balances among state powe rs and limited accoun tab i l i ty 
and transparency in the p u b l i c adm in is t ra t ion (Annex 2 p rov ides a broader desc r ip t ion o f 
governance). The recent p res iden t ia l elections are a clear ind ica t ion that a healthier and 
m o r e compe t i t ive p o l i t i c a l process i s starting t o get underway, with the expectation o f 
im p r o v e d p u b l i c debate and social consensus building. There are also increasing e f fo r ts 
in the p u b l i c adm in is t ra t ion t o o f fse t the systemic practices o f patronage and co r rup t ion . 
The i n i t i a l steps towa rds the development o f a p ro fess iona l c i v i l service i s an impo r tan t 
goa l in this process. 

24. 
Paraguay faces very serious challenges in the area o f co r rup t ion con t ro l . 
A c c o r d i n g t o a recent a s ~ e s sm e n t , ’ ~ the pe rcep t ion o f co r rup t ion i s high in a l l 
governmental ins t i tu t ions , i n c l u d i n g state-owned enterprises and the t w o b ina t iona l 
en te rp r ises . A c c o r d i n g to this report, a high degree o f co r rup t ion i s associated with 
campa ign finance, and p u b l i c contracts o r concessions, a l though large scale co r rup t ion 
also th r ives in contraband and other i l l i c i t ac t iv i t ies . Co r rup t ion also affects multiple 
aspects o f d a i l y l i f e . These findings corroborate the ou tcome o f an earlier survey 
conducted b y a p u b l i d p r i v a t e C o u n c i l established t o p romo te in teg r i t y in 2005 (the 
“Consejo Impulsor del Sistema Nacional de Integridad-CISNI“). 

Poverty 

25. 
In spite o f recent imp rovemen ts in pove r t y and income inequa l i ty rates since 
2002, b o t h we l fa re measures rema in high re la t ive t o the r e s t o f L a t i n Am e r i c a (see para. 
10). In addition, current o f f i c i a l data shows n o progress in pove r t y reduc t ion when seen 
ove r the last decade. Part o f income inequa l i ty originates th rough inequa l i t ies in access t o 
basic oppo r tun i t ies among ch i ld ren . I t i s therefore use fu l to focus social and economic 
po l ic ies o n the need t o increase oppo r tun i t ies f o r a l l . A W o r l d Bank study o n the equa l i ty 
o f oppo r tun i t ies in access t o basic services among ch i ld ren in L a t i n Am e r i c a shows that, 
a l though Paraguay i s close t o h a v i n g un ive rsa l access t o e lec t r ic i ty , i t s t i l l has a l o n g r o a d 
ahead in education and water and sanitation. The study suggests Paraguay needs t o focus 
o n inc reas ing coverage rates and, in particular, o n pay ing close a t ten t ion t o the coverage 
rates o f disadvantaged groups. 

26. 

S o c i a l Exc lus ion . Indeed, Paraguay faces tremendous challenges in t e rm s o f 
social exc lus ion that cond i t ion many o f the high expectations that the n ew Gove rnmen t 
faces as i t en te rs o f f ice . In the r u r a l areas, as no ted above, Paraguay has the highest 
concen t ra t ion o f l a n d owne rsh ip in the wo r ld . While s ign i f ican t investments in cap i ta l 
and 
land 
imp rovemen ts are being made b y some o f the 
large stakeholders, 
nonag r icu l tu ra l r u r a l j o b s are scarce. Thus, about 24 percent o f the ru ra l popu la t ion l i v e s 
in extreme pove r ty , and a to ta l o f 3 5 percent l i v e s b e l ow the pove r t y line ove ra l l .

Ind igenous people (about 87,000 people na t ionw ide o r about 1.7 percent o f the na t iona l 
popu la t ion ) face pa r t icu la r challenges: in the 4 12 ind igenous commun i t ies registered 
na t ionw ide , o n l y 5 5 percent o f res iden t s have secure land access (either t i t led o r with t i t l e 
in process). O n l y 26 percent o f these commun i t ies have their o w n hea l th centers o r posts. 
In addition, the hab i ta t occup ied by m a n y ind igenous commun i t ies has undergone 
deforestation in recent year and consequent env i ronmen ta l degradation, and in m a n y 
cases cannot p rov ide the commun i t ies with adequate sustenance. As a consequence o f 
these problems, m a n y peasants and ind igenous people have m ig ra ted t o c i t ies and se t t led 
in ma rg ina l zones. 

27. 
As the ru ra l poo r m o v e t o u rban areas, they face a shortage o f m in imum -s tanda rd 
housing, p u b l i c services and emp loymen t oppo r tun i t ies . In the A s u n c i o n M e t r o p o l i t a n 
area alone, some 150,000 peop le l ive in 78 i n f o rm a l settlements. Demog raph ica l ly , 
Paraguay i s a young coun t ry with 2/3 o f the na t iona l popu la t ion b e l ow 3 0 years o f age 
and some 36% b e l ow 15. One in th ree Paraguayans between age 7 and 17 works, o f ten in 
an ill-defined and insecure env i ronmen t . A c c o r d i n g t o the 200 1 In teg ra ted Househo ld 
Survey, some 38,000 m i n o r s be tween the ages o f 5 and 17 w o r k e d as domestic servants 
in p r iva te homes. O n l y 3 in 10 p o o r ch i ld ren between the ages o f 5 and 9 have a na t iona l 
identity card, a circumstance tha t limits access t o p u b l i c b e n e f i t s and programs. 

28. 
Soc ia l P ro tec t ion . Paraguay features limited risk coverage th rough pa r t ic ipa t ion 
in the fo rma l labo r market. In addition, despite a decrease in f o rm a l unemployment, 
unde remp loymen t and i n f o rm a l i t y are o n the rise. In te rna t iona l experience has p roven 
that well targeted cond i t iona l cash transfers are an e f fec t ive means o f comba t ing extreme 
pove r ty . The mos t impo r tan t e f f o r t Paraguay has made in this d i rec t ion i s th rough the 
cond i t iona l cash transfers p rog ram ( T E KO POR A ) w h i c h was i n i t i a l l y in t roduced in the 
poorest areas o f the coun t ry . Howeve r , p rog ram coverage has so fa r been limited, due t o 
the large number o f p u b l i c social programs under imp lemen ta t ion w h i c h are compe t ing 
f o r limited management and f inanc ia l resources. In the short-term, therefore, Paraguay 
needs t o focus o n p r i o r i t i z i n g social programs, w i th a v i ew at concen t ra t ing i t s resources 
o n the mos t e f fec t ive ones. Mo reove r , with the p ro jec ted deceleration o f the economy, a 
well targeted se t o f social p rog rams w i l l be needed in order t o p ro tec t the mos t 
vulnerable. 

H e a l t h . 

29. 
The new Gove rnmen t faces urgent challenges in the hea l th sector, 
i n c l u d i n g high infant and ma te rna l m o r t a l i t y rates, and poo r qua l i ty and l i m i t e d access t o 
hea l th services. P r o v i s i o n o f p u b l i c hea l th i s inadequate and has suffered persistent 
de te r io ra t ion over the last ten years. Paraguay has also been exposed t o epidemics that 
affect the popu la t ion , such as outbreaks o f malaria, dengue, and y e l l ow fever. The 
de te r io ra t ion in hea l th outcomes has occurred despite an increase in Government 
spending f o r hea l th by US$18 per capita in 2007. The l o w impac t o f increased p u b l i c 
spending i s attributable t o f ragmen ta t ion in the p r o v i s i o n o f p u b l i c hea l th care between 
the M i n i s t r y o f H e a l t h and the pens ion and hea l th fund - with a v ib ran t but o f ten 
unregulated ne two rk o f p r iva te p rov ide rs f i l l ing in numerous gaps. Desp i te these 
overlaps, acco rd ing t o the WHO , almost 40 percent o f the popu la t ion does n o t have 
access t o hea l th services. Ove ra l l , p u b l i c spending focuses substantially o n inputs, 
pa r t icu la r ly human resources, where incentives and tasks are n o t a lways w e l l defined. 
F ina l ly , the sector i s affected by a s ign i f ican t degree o f po l i t ic iza t ion .

30. 
Education. In the 
last decade, Paraguay’s .education system has made 
considerable strides, inc lud ing an improvement in system coverage at a l l levels, increases 
in the average educational level o f the population, and improvements in the sector’s 
internal e f f i c i e n c y . In addition, public expenditure on education (around 4 percen t o f 
GDP) i s one o f the highest in the region. Despite these achievements, participation rates 
in Paraguay are among the lowest in the region, especially in secondary education where 
desertion rates are high. Therefore, Paraguay needs to carefully evaluate the r e s u l t s o f 
educational reforms and prepare a program for the near future, wh ich i s the focus of 
current efforts b y bo th the Bank and other donors. The medium-term agenda includes, 
inter alia, an expansion in the coverage o f m idd le leve l education (grades 7-9), 
improvements in equity in access to the th i rd cycle o f elementary education and middle 
level education, as we l l as improvements in system efficiency and in educational quality 
in v iew o f increasing coverage. 

3 1. 
Public Pensions. W i t h on ly 0.6 percent o f workers in the lowest income quintile 
participating in the system, Paraguay i s the country in L a t i n America w i t h the lowest 
coverage and the most inequitable access to pensions. Therefore, in the medium-term, 
there i s an urgent need for Government to gradually improve the pension system, w i t h the 
objectives o f mak ing the system more un i fo rm and equitable, and o f increasing i t s 
coverage. 

Growth and Environment 

32. 
Paraguay’s long run growth performance has been disappointing. GDP per capita 
grew b y 1 ?4 percent on average s ince 1960, but over the past 25 years, GDP per capita 
declined b y a yearly average o f ?4 percent. The r e c e n t growth acceleration between 2004 
and 2008, the largest expansion s ince the 1970s, was welcomed, but sustaining i t w i l l be 
a challenge due to a number o f weaknesses in the economic structure. Wh i le private 
investments have contributed to the development o f new products and opened new 
markets over the past few years (e.g., beef exports to Israel and Russia, sesame exports to 
Japan, stevia exports to the region, and organic sugar to Europe), the export base i s s t i l l 
narrow and h igh ly dependent on commodities. The investment in private ports and a 
public-private association for animal health has eased some o f the logistics and 
certification barriers faced b y products such as soy bean and bee f . As noted above, 
Paraguay has improved education coverage, particularly at the p r ima ry level. However, 
Paraguay’s economic potential i s s t i l l constrained by weak human and physical cap i ta l , as 
we l l as the economic and f inanc ia l vo la t i l i ty the country has experienced (see Annex 4 on 
Growth Prospects). 

3 3 . 

Agriculture. Beyond the macro trends described above, agriculture in Paraguay i s 
a story o f three sectors - a h igh ly productive, mechanized agricultural sec tor focused on 
exports (concentrated on soybeans and b e e f wh ich together represent about 90 percent o f 
registered exports) wh i ch exists alongside large extensions s t i l l under-utilized and a large 
number o f poo r ly educated smallholders w i t h l i t t l e access to effective agricultural 
extension se rv ices , land and capital. W i t h i n small landholders, some are so poor and 
deprived o f land, human capital and bas ic se rv ice s that they are un l ike ly to survive 
without significant social assistance. Others, however, have had better access to basic 
11 

services-particularly education-and are s low ly fo rm ing a small but success fu l middle 
class in rural areas, devoting time to bo th agricultural and service activities. Among small 
landholders, the youth has for the most part migrated to Asuncion or to Argentina, Spain 
or the Un i ted States. 

34 . 

Transport, Communication and Water. There are a number o f infrastructure 

bottlenecks that l im i t social inclusion o f the poor and the country’s competitiveness as an 
exporter. The paved network, although accounting fo r l e s s than 10 percent o f the overall 
road network, connects major trade cen te r s w i t h i n the country and w i t h Mercosur. The 
challenge ahead i s to deploy an appropriate program o f routine maintenance to avoid 
losing this key investment. The rural roads network comprises very few all-weather 
roads, p rov id ing rural communities w i t h limited access to markets and bas ic social 
services. In river-based transportation, the key i s s u e i s the l a c k o f dredging and signaling, 
wh ich imposes excessive logistic costs. This i s currently an unfunded mandate fo r the 
public entity that administers the country’s s ta te ports, Adm in is t rac idn N a c i o n a l de 
Navegac idn y Pue r tos (ANNR), wh ich i s also responsible fo r regulating private ports. 
The A N N R and the M in i s t ry o f Public Works are exploring ways to address this issue , 
inc lud ing the possibility o f unbundling the functions o f ports and waterways regulator 
f rom those o f operating the country’s ports. In addition, the private sector (key r ive r use rs 
such as private ports, barges operators, and load owners) have expressed willingness to 
create a public-private partnership that wou ld be responsible fo r r ive r maintenance and 
signaling. In telecommunications, despite a significant liberalization o f the ce l lu la r 
network, f ixed l i n e s and fiber optic cable were u n t i l recently under the monopoly o f 
Compafiia Pa raguaya de Comun icac iones (COPACO), 
the country’s state-owned 
enterprise. This monopolistic situation i s responsible for the very l im i ted penetration o f 
broadband internet and lack o f affordable and good quality long-distance dialing. The 
new administration has shown a strong commitment to address this i s s u e and, in Ma rch 
2009, issued a resolution (w i t h Wo r ld Bank technical support) that opened access to fiber 
optic. However, the liberalization o f Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), over wh ich 
COPACO s t i l l enjoys a monopoly, i s s t i l l pending. In the water supply and sanitation 
sector, w i t h on ly 61 percent o f the population connected to piped water supply networks 
(and on ly 49 percent in rural areas), s e r v i c e coverage in Paraguay remains l o w even in 
comparison w i t h other lower middle income countries. On ly 8 percent o f the national 
population has access to piped sanitation. 

3 5 . 

Business Climate. Paraguay’s overall ranking in the D o i n g Business indicator 
dropped f rom 108 in 2008 to 115 in 2009, wh ich i s be low the average fo r L A C and fo r 
lower m idd le income countries. The downward change reflects lower rankings in four 
areas: starting a business, registering property, getting credit and trading across borders. 
Wh i le Paraguay continues to fare comparatively we l l in the first three areas, the 
deterioration in the latter area puts the country in the lowest quartile. Improvements in 
ranking were achieved in two areas: closing a bus iness and enforcing contracts, although 
Paraguay continues to lag behind comparator countries in both o f these areas. Paraguay’s 
poorest performance i s in employing workers, trading across borders, and closing a 
business. The country also needs to consolidate i t s 2007 gains in the opening a business 
indicator, by modernizing the handling o f relevant transactions b y the c i ty o f Asunci6n 
and other major c i t ies . 

12 

36. 
Electricity. Wh i le Paraguay i s blessed w i t h abundant hydropower generation 
capacity, key weaknesses in transmission and distribution hamper the development o f 
productive activities in bo th rural and urban areas, as we l l as the prospects for formal 
exports. Wh i le electricity coverage reaches 93.8 percen t o f a l l households (just below the 
L A C average o f 94.6 percent), average per capita consumption per year was on ly 8 5 3 
kWh , far lower than in Chile or in B raz i l . Moreover, system losses are very h i g h and 
w e l l above the 13.5 percent weighted average fo r the L A C region. The authorities are 
currently discussing w i t h B raz i l possible ways o f making the bilateral treaty on the Itaipu 
damn more flexible, thereby a l low ing Paraguay to better u t i l ize this important asset. 

37. 
Environment. Paraguay has lost at leas t 80 percent o f i t s forests over the last 50 
years and losses o f 500 h d d a y occurred between 1966 and 1991. O f the remaining 2 
m i l l i o n ha in the Upper Parana A t lan t ic Forest (UPAF, i .e . forests east o f the Paraguay 
River), only an estimated 800,000 are s t i l l considered productive. This i s due to 
destructive logging practices that have degraded the forests, and a r e s u l t o f deforestation 
that has fragmented much o f the U P A F in to unmanageably small remnant patches. Wh i le 
deforestation appears t o have slowed recently in the e a s t - d u e both to resource depletion 
and some success w i t h a “Zero Deforestation” law-it 
i s estimated to have increased in 
the A r i d Chaco, wh ich i s home to 78 percent o f Paraguay’s remaining native forests. 
W i t h the r igh t incentives and institutions, however, Paraguay could exploit 
comparative advantage in forestry, as rates o f return for key varieties in Paraguay appear 
to be higher than in other countries in the Southern Cone. To this end Paraguay started to 
promote forest conservation and payments for ecological services. The country has also 
started to reform i t s Forest Management Services b y granting the ins t i tu t ion greater 
autonomy.

111. 
TH E GOVERNMENT’S ECONOM IC AND SOCIAL PROGRAM 
3 8 . 
The new Government’s v is ion i s based on the need to improve governance and 
reduce corruption, address the needs o f vulnerable groups, and restore growth in l igh t o f 
the e f f e c t s o f the international financial crisis. The e lemen ts o f a program to achieve 
these goals were outlined in various presidential addresses and a re n ow embodied in the 
M in is t ry o f Finance Economic and Social Plan for 2008-2013’6. The Plan i s part o f a 
broader Government’s Program that the new administration i s preparing and updating on 
the basis o f submissions b y the ind iv idua l Ministries, and has been adjusted in l i g h t o f the 
global economic c r i s i s (see para. 17). 

39. 
The main features o f the program can be subsumed in to t h r e e major cross-cutting 
themes below. 

P Governance: S t reng then ing s ta te ins t i tu t ions t o imp rove p o l i c y mak ing , p u b l i c

Assessment. 
The new Government has established an agenda t o in i t ia te a 
t rans i t ion t o a transparent, equitable and dynam ic economy tha t w i l l benefit f r o m the 
support o f the in te rna t iona l commun i ty . The B a n k agrees that substantial progress in the 
three cross-cutting themes and in the sub-areas identified in the Econom ic and Social 
Plan, i s needed f o r Paraguay t o reach a tu rn ing p o i n t in i t s development agenda. The CPS 
w i l l therefore focus o n assisting the authorities achieve progress in selected aspects o f the 
t h r e e cross-cutting themes underpinning future B a n k and I FC support. Howeve r , the 
B a n k i s a re la t i ve ly sm a l l dono r in Paraguay and, as such, i t w i l l be highly selective in i t s 
in te rven t ions with the expectation that these w i l l be comp lemen ta ry t o the e f fo r ts 
undertaken with the assistance o f other in te rna t iona l donors.

LESSONS FROM PREVIOUS ENGAGEMENT - THE FY03-07 CAS 

41. 

S ta r t ing in 2003, the B a n k in i t ia ted a process o f reengagement with Paraguay 
after a l o n g p e r i o d o f inac t iv i ty . The Bank responded q u i c k l y and pos i t ive ly t o the 
professional management demonstrated b y the new adm in is t ra t ion u p o n i t s com ing t o 
o f f i c e in April 2003 by p repa r ing a new C A S f o r FY03-07 (subsequently extended t o 
FY08). The p rog ram inc luded an Econom ic Recove ry L o a n f o r US$30M t o h e l p address 
the f inanc ia l c r is is and mee t s ign i f ican t budgetary sho r t fa l ls at the time. The C A S also 
envisaged engagement in n ew sectors such as health, roads, pensions and social 
protection, and p r o v i d e d support in p repa r ing a strong package o f f inanc ia l sector 
re fo rms . 

42. 

Imp lemen ta t ion o f the C A S faced s ign i f ican t d i f f i c u l t i e s and f e l l short o f the 
expected outcomes. Only US$146.5 m i l l i o n in loans were app roved f o r the extended 
C A S pe r iod FY04-08 ou t o f the base case envelope o f US$325 m i l l i o n . O n l y f ive loans 

14 

reached e f fec t iveness and two additional projects were approved but are s t i l l not 
effective”. W i t h the benefit o f hindsight, implementation o f the CAS program wou ld 
have been stronger i f the Bank had better taken in to account various factors including: 

0 The complexity o f governance i s s u e s in Paraguay, particularly as they pertain to 
the relationship between the executive and the legislature. The constitutional 
requirement that Congress approves each loan ind iv idua l ly after Board approval 
led to substantial delays in the effectiveness o f projects, and ultimately to the 
cancellations o f the Maternal C h i l d Basic Hea l th Insurance Project, as well as the 
Strengthening o f the Ministry o f Finance Technical Assistance loan and the 
Financial Sector Technical Assistance loan. 
The limited capacity o f the public administration to plan, execute and monitor 
public investment operations. The establishment o f quality project teams 
constitutes a serious challenge that affects project implementation, particularly at 
the i n i t i a l stages. There i s , overall, a l ow level o f professional capacity in the

Limited Bank presence on the ground has imp l ied a lack o f continuity in po l icy 
dialogue, and an inab i l i ty to provide t ime ly preparation or implementation 
support. To address this problem, project management was in some cases

The success o f the A A A program was also lower than expected. A 2007 Q A G 
assessment 
found the AAA program moderately satisfactory overall, and h igh ly 
satisfactory in t e r m s o f i t s strategic relevance, coherence and integration. However, the 
program was rated only moderately satisfactory in t e r m s o f i t s l i k e l y impact, local 
participation, consultation and dissemination. Nonetheless, some AAA products were 
deemed useful b y the Government (e.g., the FY08 Integrated Fiduciary Assessment, the 
FY08 Education Sector Study, and the FY08 and FY03 Policy Notes) and others added 
long lasting value to the development agenda in Paraguay as, for example, the FY07 
Land Tax study, wh ich i s being used b y the Lug0 administration as a key input in to i t s 
own tax po l icy reform program. S i n c e the Q A G panel report was issued, the Bank has 
increased i t s emphasis on c l i e n t participation to improve ownership and has enhanced 
collaboration w i t h other donors. 

44. Many lessons can be drawn f rom the experience o f the 2003 CAS, inc lud ing the 
need to invest in bu i ld ing broad project ownership during the preparation stage, and that 
o f leveraging technical assistance w i t h grant funding t o the extent possible. 
conclusion, the 2003 CAS served as a too l for the Bank to maintain a seat at the po l icy 
table and had a l im i ted but s t i l l significant development impact. The shortfall in the 
delivery o f the lending program l im i ted the degree o f partnership and risk-sharing

V. THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 

A. 

STRATEGIC CONTEXT 

45. 
Th is CPS proposes an increased engagement o f the B a n k as Paraguay in i t ia tes a 
new phase in i t s e f fo r ts t o surmount s ign i f ican t and entrenched development challenges. 
The process ahead w i l l mos t p robab ly be d i f f i c u l t and there are no guarantees o f success. 
Howeve r , the new Adm in is t ra t ion ’s key strategic p r io r i t ies constitute a so l id basis f o r the 
B a n k t o focus i t s support. 
In the near t e rm , there i s also strong coincidence in the 
approach proposed by the authorities to m i t iga te the effects o f the g loba l f inanc ia l crisis, 
w h i c h w i l l also be an impo r tan t focus o f ou r partnership. The Bank ’s proposed strategy 
also seeks t o further strengthen the e f fo r ts undertaken b y c i v i l society t o t rans fo rm 
Paraguay in to a mo re democratic, equitable and prosperous society. In this context, and 
in order t o ensu re an e f fec t ive response to the emerging needs a r is ing from chang ing 
domestic and external conditions, the B a n k proposes t o focus o n the f o l l ow i n g strategic 
in i t ia t ives :

The proposed program, while c lea r ly delineated, has some built-in f l e x i b i l i t y t o 
a l l ow the Gove rnmen t t o make adjustments as the economic, po l i t ica l , and social 
environment evolves. Therefore, o n l y the i n i t i a l t w o years o f the CPS ind ica t ive p rog ram 
w i l l be identified, w i th the outer years l e f t open in order t o accommodate future‘needs 
(see Box 1 b e l ow f o r k e y p rog ram parameters). 

Box 1: K e y Parameters o f the Country Partnership StratePy 
An average indicative Bank lending program o f about $100 m i l l ion per year up to a total o f $500 
m i l l ion i s projected for the five year period FY09-FY13. The CPS, however, does not propose a 
detailed lending program beyond FY 10, with the identified program being about U S 2 6 5 million, or 53 
percent o f the entire envelope. 
There i s a c lea r recognition o f the significant risks involved in the implementation o f the proposed 
strategy. The political environment, the country’s implementation capacity and uncertain external 
conditions constitute significant factors that could end up adversely affecting the viability o f the 
proposed assistance scenario. Thus, i t i s proposed that intensive monitoring and flexibility be 
considered critical elements o f CPS implementation. The Bank w i l l engage the authorities periodically 
in order to assess progress and w i l l be prepared to change the proposed partnership terms i f adverse 
conditions would make the proposed strategy impracticable. 
Up to 40 percent o f the CPS envelope (Le. $200 million) w i l l be in the form o f Programmatic 
Development Policy Loans (DPLs) in the governance area. The indicative program also includes about 
US $ 6 5 million in identified investment lending in the three thematic areas (see Table 4 below). 
Non-lending support w i l l also be provided in the form o f AAA , grants and f e e for services, when 
appropriate, in support o f government priorities and the lending program. 
The indicative envelope o f $500 m i l l ion over the FY09-FY 13 period would increase Bank exposure in 
US dollar terms, but still leaving the Bank a relatively minor creditor. The indicative envelope would be 
revised at the time o f the CPS Progress Report in the third year o f implementation, subject to the level 
o f absorption, implementation capacity and Government’s ability to maintain a sound macroeconomic 
framework, as well as the Bank’s lending capacity at that time. 
At the proposed lending levels, and under the macro-framework presented i n Annex Table B6, total 
IBRD debt i s expected to remain below 3 percent o f GDP and converge to 14 percent o f total public 
debt over the medium term. Debt service to the World Bank i s expected to represent less than 2 percent 
o f total f isca l revenues. 
The Bank plans to collaborate closely with IFC, particularly in sectors that could enhance growth or 
offer new opportunities to increase value added, such as finances, infrastructure, SME development, 
agribusiness and trade. 

47. 

The CPS was prepared o n the basis o f extensive consultations with the 
Government, the in te rna t iona l commun i ty and c i v i l society. This b road consultative 
process he lped shape the CPS and i n f o rm e d i t s design (see Annex 6). In addition, during 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the CPS, a special e f f o r t w i l l be made t o strengthen donor 
coo rd ina t ion f o r a l l activities, m o v i n g f r o m coo rd ina t ion t o j o i n t ac t iv i t ies and missions 
and even t o seeking f o rm a l co - f inanc ing f o r ou r projects.

Governance 

49. 
The Lug0 administration i s placing governance a t the forefront o f i t s re fo rm 
agenda. In particular, President Lugo’s program emphasizes the need to break w i t h past 
practices that enabled corruption and to establish a new standard o f governance for the 
country based on improved democratic dialogue, increased accountability, transparency 
and integrity. W i t h i n this overall context, and in l i n e w i t h Paraguay’s recen t decision to 
become a p i lo t for the implementation o f the Bank’s G A C strategy, the Bank intends to 
significantly increase i t s governance assistance to Paraguay (See B o x 2). The G AC 
provides a broad framework for the various initiatives through wh ich the Bank w i l l 
provide i t s governance assistance to the country. The ma in expected outcome o f Bank 
support in this field w i l l be that the current administration w i l l mark the turning po in t o f a 
credible process through wh ich Paraguay w i l l attain adequate governance standards and 
institutional development. 

Lending. A se r ies o f th ree Programmatic Development Policy Loans (DPLs), w i t h a 
tentative envelope o f US$ 200 million, w i l l support fiscal management and public 
sector reforms, inc lud ing improved accountability o f public en te rp r ises , c i v i l service 
re fo rm and the overhaul o f the internal control system for the public administration. 
Technical Assistance for supporting the authorities’ re fo rm efforts i s being provided 
b y several bilateral donors inc lud ing the EU, USAID and Japan. 
In addition, the 
DPLs w i l l provide t ime ly budget support to ensure that c r i t ica l social spending i s not 
affected. This program w i l l contribute to the Government plan’s overall objective o f 
achieving sustainable and more equitable growth b y p rov id ing direct support to th ree 
o f i t s areas o f focus: macroeconomic policy, state-owned en te rp r ise s and state 
modernization. The D P L se r ies i s also designed to assist the Government in i t s 
efforts to contribute to the anti-crisis p lan f rom January 2009. 

Non-Lending. The Bank’s program w i l l contribute to furthering the governance 
agenda through the various G AC initiatives (See B o x 2) 

Other. Equally important wou ld be to support the Government’s effectiveness 
agenda in the area o f service delivery, b y incorporating a governance component in to 
Bank-financed investment operations - -bu i ld ing on the success fu l experience o f the 
Roads Maintenance Project, which includes a Governance Ac t ion Plan wh ich 
supports the supply s ide o f governance and encourages social participation, control 
and accountability. 

IFC. The I FC aims to ease the microfinance environment v ia improved regulation 
and a potential expansion in advisory se rv ice s . In early FY09, the Business Enabling 
Environment (BEE) o f L A C ’ S Advisory Services (AS) Fac i l i ty visited Paraguay and 
presented to the Government and to the private sector experiences in other countries 
on s imp l i fy ing processes for attaining construction and operating l i censes . This was 
w e l l received and the BEE team i s prepared to wo rk on this topics should the 
authorities request i t . IFC i s w i l l i n g to place an investment officer in the W o r l d 
Bank’s o f f ice i f their program in Paraguay warrants it. 

19 

Box 2: GAC in Paraguay 
The Paraguay GAC strategic objective i s to establish the Bank as an advisor o f choice for the Government 
o f President Lug0 i n its mission to develop a viable governance path towards increased soc ia l equity, 
economic growth and stronger democratic institutions. The Bank recognizes there are important 
development partners that have been playing a proactive and substantive role in supporting governance 
related activities in Paraguay and the Bank w i l l work in c lose coordination with them. Building on 
previous areas o f involvement, the GAC Pilot seeks to engage the government in a mu l t i- pronged GAC 
agenda dealing with: 

Broad governance issues where the Bank can play a facilitating role in placing governance as a 
priority in the overall public policy agenda. 
I n this area the Bank supported an International 
Conference on Governance and Development convened by President Lug0 in August 2008 with the 
objective o f presenting to the domestic political community relevant international experience in the 
handling o f governance challenges. The Government has made two additional requests for assistance 
in: ( i ) facilitating the return o f stolen assets through the StAR initiative: and (ii) improving the 
domestic investigative and sanctioning capacity to handle corruption. Both these activities respond to 
specific government needs and enjoy strong ownership by the new administration. The Bank 
envisages to take a leading role in both initiatives, while ensuring close coordination with other donors 
in the respective fields. 

0 Country fiduciary agenda derived mostly from our recent Integrated Fiduciary Assessment (IFA). 
The IFA has provided the analytical basis for a reform agenda aimed at improving transparency and 
accountability in key government functions, i.e., public investment planning and implementation, c iv i l 
service reform, state enterprise oversight and improved internal and external control mechanisms. This 
proposed agenda w i l l be supported by a se r ies o f programmatic DPLs over the next years, together 
with a strong effort to coordinate the reform agenda with other development partners providing 
t e c h n i c a l assistance support in these areas. 

0 An investmentportfolio agenda consisting i n the mainstreaming o f a l l Bank funded operations within 
the regular state structure (thus, doing away with PIUs and the outsourcing o f project implementation 
to international agencies) and i n increasing reliance on country systems in key fiduciary areas. This 
agenda faces significant governance challenges, as 
i t has 
implied phasing out ring fencing 
arrangements which were customary in Bank operations and tackling the c iv i l service, organizational 
and fiduciary challenges derived from the increased reliance in country systems. I n line with this 
agenda, the Government has recently issued new c iv i l service r u l e s to a t trac t qualified personnel in the 
handling o f internationally funded investment projects. 

0 A sector andproject specific agenda. Starting with the path-breaking Road Maintenance Project, new 
operations are expected to develop explicit governance frameworks to deal with governance challenges 
in the respective sector. GAC-related incremental preparation budgets have enabled the conduct o f 
governance related analytical work in the education, rural and water and sewerage sectors. 
I t i s 
expected that new operations in these fields w i l l have a much stronger governance content. One 
specific challenge for the r u r a l sector i s the development o f detailed frameworks to introduce increased 
transparency and accountability in community driven projects, users’ associations and the broader 
communities. 

In implementing the GAC, the Bank w i l l seek to mobilize trust funds and other resources which would 
allow the country to make progress in the various areas and initiatives. 

Poverty 

50. 
The Government’s b road and amb i t ious ob jec t ive o f reducing poverty entails, 
inter alia, a reduc t ion in pove r ty l e v e l s th rough emp loymen t creation, an imp rovemen t in 
social indicators, a decrease in inequa l i t y th rough increased access t o public se rv ice s and 
land, and a reduc t ion in the inc idence o f c h i l d labo r . Within these b road objectives, i t i s 

20 

expected that Bank support w i l l contribute to imp rov ing l i v i n g conditions fo r the rural 
poor through imp rov ing access to and the effectiveness o f social programs in education, 
water and sanitation, safety nets and access to land (see Annex 5 for country’s indicators 
w i t h respect to MDGs). 

0 Lending. In the immediate term, and to mitigate the impact o f the global financial 
c r i s i s on the vulnerable population, the D P L se r ies i s expected to provide the 
resources needed b y the Government to maintain the social programs already 
included in the 2009 budget. In addition, the proposed additional financing to the 
Community Development Project w i l l continue past support to loca l communities, 
and the recently approved Water and Sanitation Modernization Project w i l l support 
an expansion in coverage o f water supply and sanitation services. In the medium- 
term, the Bank program i s expected to assist the authorities in designing and 
implementing a market based land re fo rm through a proposed Land A ccess and 
Administration operation. In addition, a Secondary Education project i s included in 
the first two years o f the indicative program under the CPS. I t i s expected that this 
project w i l l contribute to improve educational coverage and outcomes, particularly in 
the rural areas, and help the authorities establish a scholarship program to develop a 
future cadre o f Government officials. The Bank and the authorities are also discussing 
possible Bank engagement in expanding safety ne t s through non-lending activities 
that could be fo l lowed b y an investment operation. 

Non-lending. In terms o f A A A , the Bank w i l l continue an active engagement w i t h 
the authorities in the poverty area. The successful poverty assessment non-lending 
TA , wh ich helped to improve poverty measurements and also carried out, j o i n t l y w i t h 
local researchers, an analysis o f poverty issues , w i l l be continued. This w i l l be 
supported b y a programmatic dialogue on safety nets, and on the coverage o f 
vulnerable populations through the country’s formal health and pension systems. In 
addition, the Bank w i l l continue to mob i l ize grant funding, inc lud ing f r om the Japan 
Social Development Fund, to address the needs o f vulnerable groups (two JSDF 
grants supporting indigenous groups are currently ongoing). 

Sustainable Growth and Environment 

5 1 . 

The authorities’ key objective i s to foster sustainable growth w i t h a focus on 
employment generation and managing better the country’s hydroelectric potential, while 
safeguarding macroeconomic stability and the environment. The Bank and IFC w i l l 
support this objective through programs for the short- and medium-term. In the short- 
term, the focus w i l l be on safeguarding macroeconomic stability and, in particular, on 
helping mitigate the effects o f the global financial c r i s i s on economic activity, 
employment and poor households b y p rov id ing quick disbursing funds as part o f the 
proposed programmatic DPLs. The IFC’s immediate focus w i l l be on facilitating 
financial intermediation and helping the authorities improve the investment climate. The 
Bank and IFC w i l l also launch programs for the medium-term aiming at e i the r supporting 
interventions that unambiguously enhance g row th prospects, o r facilitating the internal 
dialogue on h ow best to promote sustainable g row th (See Annex 6 on G row th Prospects). 
S p e c i f i c interventions wou ld include:

The f lex ib le nature o f the CPS creates a need f o r clear guidelines as t o when and

PORTFOLIO 

56. 
The Bank ’s p o r t f o l i o in Paraguay i s small, cons is t ing o f t w o p ro jec ts under 
imp lemen ta t ion (the Road Ma in tenance P ro jec t f o r US$74 m i l l i o n app roved in FY07 , and 

23 

the Secondary Education Project fo r US$24 m i l l i o n approved in F Y 2004), and three 
projects awaiting effectiveness pending Parliamentary approval (the US$37.5 m i l l i o n 
Sustainable Ag r icu l tu ra l and Rural Development Project approved in FY08, the US$9 
m i l l i o n additional financing for Community Development Project, also approved in 
FY08, and the Water and Sanitation Sector Modernization Project)'*. Overall, the 
po r t fo l io i s considered satisfactory, as indicated b y the satisfactory ra t ing o f the two 
projects under implementation and the two projects wh ich have recently closed (the 
i n i t i a l phase o f the Community Development project and the Fou r th Rural Water Supply 
Project). However, the tw o project awaiting effectiveness fo r over six months have been 
downgraded to unsatisfactory status given delays in their approval b y Parliament. 

57. 
F rom the beginning o f 2006, the Government and the Bank made a strong effort 
to improve po r t fo l io performance in a context o f h igh fiduciary risk. Particular focus was 
placed on institutional aspects o f operations, ensuring not on ly fiduciary compliance but 
also capacity bu i ld ing . A systematic financial management and procurement assessmen t 
o f the po r t fo l io i s carried out on a regular basis. In addition, the SEPA (Sistema de 
Ejecucibn de Planes de Adquisiciones) i s expected to be introduced as the po r t fo l io 
grows in size to ensu re greater transparency in the procurement process. The system has 
been presented to the Government and i s currently being implemented b y the Road 
Maintenance Project. I t w i l l be subsequently implemented b y the Sustainable Agriculture 
and Rural Development Project and the additional financing for the Community 
Development Project as soon as they become effective. The expectation look ing forward 
i s to continue deepening this effort in particular in the design o f new operations. 

5 8 . 
However, the ma in challenge to po r t fo l io performance continues to be posed by 
extensive delays in obtaining Congressional approval o f new projects, as in Paraguay a l l 
externally funded loans and grants require Congressional approval on a case b y case basis 
outside o f the budget process. The Executive i s committed to inc rease the f l ow o f 
information to Parliament on donor funded projects and the Bank w i l l support these 
efforts b y ensuring that in fo rma t ion on planned Bank funded projects i s readily and 
widely available However, s ince major improvements are needed in the institutional 
processes whereby the Executive and the Legislative branches approve external 
assistance, wh ich are also at t imes politicized, this i s s u e w i l l continue to pose serious 
consequences for the predictability and level o f development assistance. 

59 . 
Progress in po r t fo l io management was accompanied b y positive s teps towards 
strengthening financial management. The 2006 budget l aw prohibited the use o f 
outsourcing in the implementation o f new projects. This w i l l initiate a strong effort to 
strengthen state s truc tures for the management o f investment projects. In addition, an 
important tax and customs reform was initiated in 2004, and technical improvements to 
the budget process were 
implemented in the areas o f financial planning, cash 
management, and budget accounting. W i t h the support o f the IDB and the Un i ted States 
Agency for International Development (USAID), the Comptroller General o f the 
Republic has been strengthened, wh ich has contributed to some improvement in the 
external audit function. Despite these efforts, external audit s t i l l exhibits considerable

weaknesses, inc lud ing the limited effectiveness o f fo l low -up on audit recommendations. 
The Government i s also in i t ia t ing reforms o f the internal audit function ( A u d i t o r i a

procurement, modern legislation has been recently adopted. This, together w i t h the 
creation o f the General Directorate for Public Procurement and the development o f a 
public procurement system, has strengthened transparency. 

In 

60. 
Despite these accomplishments and the commitment o f the new Government to 
improve public financial management and the accountability and control environment, 
substantial challenges remain for both the authorities and the donor community. In the 
areas o f f inanc ia l management and control, the initiatives undertaken are too re cen t to 
show significant resu l ts and need to be monitored. M o r e efforts a r e required to strengthen 
control agencies. The Bank w i l l continue i t s dialogue w i t h the authorities during the CPS 
period in order to identify opportunities to assist the Government in planning and 
implementing reforms fo r imp rov ing public financial management and accountability. 
This w i l l be carried out b y expanding non-project fiduciary wo rk and b y iden t i fy ing 
opportunities for p rov id ing support through grant funding. 

61. 
IFC. Du r ing the last CAS period, IFC committed and f u l l y disbursed US $1 5 
million to finance the expansion o f a cellular telecommunication company. In FY08, IFC 
extended two trade l i n e s o f US $5 m i l l i o n each to two local financial institutions w i t h the 
goal o f strengthening the f inanc ia l sector wh i le expanding access to finance for exporters. 

C . 

IBRD FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES 
62. 
IBRD offers a full array o f financing and risk management products, wh ich could 
provide f lex ib i l i t y to Paraguay in managing i t s debt, inc lud ing the ab i l i ty to change the 
financial characteristics o f existing and future loans as to better manage financial risks 
relating to currency, in te res t rate, r o l l over and commodity p r ice vo la t i l i ty . W i t h i n this 
context, Paraguay may want to consider engaging staff o f the W o r l d Bank’s Treasury to 
become f u l l y aware o f the f lex ib i l i ty , depth and breadth o f IBRD’s full menu o f banking 
products and se rv ices , 
including IBRD’s technical assistance in designing and 
implementing a broad strategy for public debt management aimed at reducing both 
market risks and overall costs o f funding. 

63. 
IBRD recently introduced a new p r ic ing structure that makes IBRD loans more 
competitive for Paraguay. Furthermore, maturity o f IBRD loans was recently extended, 
a l low ing fo r maturities o f up to 30 years. This combination o f p r ic ing and extended 
maturities should be very attractive to the Government o f Paraguay as i t pursues i t s own 
developmental agenda throughout the new CPS period. 

D. 

DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS 

64. 
A large number o f international organization and bilateral donors are active in 
Paraguay. Paraguay, however, lacks a formal a id coordination mechanism and, up to 
recently, donor coordination has taken place largely on an ad hoc basis. S i n c e the 

25 

appointment o f President Lugo, the Government has made concerted efforts to take the 
lead in coordinating donor support, and the donor community n ow mee ts regularly, 
j o i n t l y w i t h Government counterparts, to identify a common strategy in support o f the 
new administration. E f fo r ts notwithstanding, Paraguay’s weak financial and institutional 
capacity provides the ground for a donor-driven s e t o f investment programs. Through the 
proposed CPS, the Bank w i l l support the Government’s efforts to assume the leading role 
in reviewing investment programs and particularly in deciding wh ich projects to include 
in the indicative program for the latter part o f the CPS period. 

65 . 
In the past, the Bank has maintained an active dialogue w i t h other international 
organization, inc lud ing the IADB, and key bilateral donors, inc lud ing the Un i ted States 
and Japan. 
In addition, the Bank has been in close consultations w i t h the I M F team, 
wh ich c a r r i e s out bi-annual Article I V consultations after the country successfully 
completed t h r e e successive arrangements, and has maintained close t i e s w i t h the IFC, 
particularly as i t plans to s tep up i t s involvement in Paraguay over the coming years. The 
Bank has also coordinated w i t h other relevant donors at the sectoral level and at the level 
of ind iv idua l projects. For example, the Bank has engaged very closely w i t h key partners 
in the po l icy areas covered b y the DPL , inc lud ing tax system, public sector financial 
control, expenditure management and human resources management. Table 5 be low 
provides details on key donors’ assistance programs and Bank collaborative efforts. For

No tw i ths tand ing Paraguay’s economic expans ion and s t rong performance over 
the past fou r years, a numbe r o f impo r tan t risks must be acknowledged. Some o f these 
are external risks, others are coun t ry related risks, and we w i l l o n l y address those risks 
that c o u l d a f fec t the de l ive ry o f the p rog ram under the CPS. 

68 . 

P o l i t i c a l a n d Gove rnance R isks . The m i n o r i t y h o l d o f the A P C coa l i t ion in the 
Leg is la t ive and i t s limited government experience m a y nega t ive ly impac t o n the 
Gove rnmen t ’s a b i l i t y t o fo rmu la te and implement i t s development agenda. 

6 9 . 

This m a y have t w o operational consequences f o r the Bank ’s p rog ram and, mo re 
generally, f o r a l l programs o f external assistance. First, the p repa ra t ion o f new projects 
might take longe r than expected while consensus i s be ing reached among Government 
and stakeholders. While in some sectors, such as education, a we l l defined sectoral 
strategy i s already in place, other projects are mo re l ike ly t o s u f f e r preparation delays, 
such as l a n d red is t r ibu t ion . The B a n k w i l l seek t o ca r ry ou t non - lend ing ac t iv i t ies in 
areas o f strategic p r i o r i t y f o r the authorities t o help c l a r i f y op t ions and u n i f y views. In 
add i t ion , p ro jec t p repa ra t ion shou ld se t as a c r i t i c a l p r i o r i t y the development o f consensus 
and owne rsh ip o f spec i f ic investment in i t ia t ives . Second, the re i s also a risk that even if 
the re i s consensus o n a sector strategy, a highly f ragmen ted Congress m a y f a i l t o approve 
n ew investments (with Bank ’s o r other donors’ support) once these have been prepared. 
T o m i t iga te such risk, the B a n k w i l l con t inue t o increase the know ledge available t o the 
va r ious stakeholders. A Commun ica t ion and Governance grant w i l l be imp lemen ted t o 
help strengthen the commun ica t ion s k i l l s o f b o t h the Gove rnmen t and the execu t ing 
agencies. D e s p i t e these efforts, this risk i s assessed as high, since the current ins t i tu t iona l 
env i ronmen t i s conduc ive t o subop t ima l dec is ion m a k i n g in this area. 

7 0 . 

S o c i a l R isks . Despite high economic g r ow t h and advances in employment, the 
social s i tua t ion i s fragile, given the high l e v e l s o f exc lus ion in the country. The l a c k o f 
hous ing and soc ia l services, as we l l as the recent increases in f o o d prices, are fue l ing 
tensions in the u rban areas. In the regions, the high concentration o f l a n d owne rsh ip has 
escalated tensions among large landowners and p o o r small-scale farmers and landless 
peasants. The p o l i t i c a l t rans i t ion has generated high expectations, pa r t icu la r ly among the 
poo r , that urgent social needs w i l l be me t and the n e w Gove rnmen t i s expected t o 
imp lemen t soc ia l emergency measures. There i s therefore a social risk associated with the 

28 

authorities not being able to deliver on their program as qu ick ly as the public expects, or 
in a manner that mee ts expectations. This could engender social discontent leading t o 
lack o f support fo r the Government. D e s p i t e the fact that much o f the Bank’s and other 
partners’ programs are geared to help improve social conditions in the short and medium- 
te rm , the social risk i s assessed as high. 

71. 
Fiduciary Risk. 
The ineffectiveness o f the control system, together with the 
inefficiency o f the budget process and the lack o f fiscal transparency, are the ma in 
challenges Paraguay 
faces 
in procurement and 
financial management. These 
shortcomings, coupled w i t h Paraguay’s underlying po l i t ica l and institutional weaknesses, 
are particularly ha rm fu l to the smooth implementation o f donor funded operations. As 
public sector investment depends crucially on IF Is and bilateral donors’ lending and 
grants, continued weakness o f the fiduciary environment wou ld seriously undermine the 
implementation o f the Government’s program. The Bank w i l l ensure close supervision o f 
the program under implementation over the CPS period. The new administration’s strong 
commitment towards imp rov ing the in teg r i ty environment and the actions that i t plans to 
undertake in the near future -including those under the Programmatic DPL-should 
lead 
towards a gradual improvement o f fiduciary conditions in the country. In the meanwhile, 
the fiduciary risk i s assessed as high. 

7 2 . 
External Shocks and Na tu ra l Disasters. Paraguay i s h igh ly vulnerable to further 
deceleration o f the wo r ld economy, and additional setbacks in international p r ices and 
demand fo r the country’s export products. A sustained drop in growth could also affect 
the credit quality o f the domestic financial system, and may particularly affect financial 
cooperatives. In addition, although not l i k e l y in the short to medium te rm , supply shocks 
related to higher international o i l p r ices could become a drag on the economy. Lastly, 
Paraguay’s economic activity i s h igh ly prone to natural disasters such as f i r e s , droughts 
and floods. The Bank w i l l help address the r i s k s through f lex ib i l i t y in i t s program, 
thereby a l low ing resources to be redirected qu ick ly towards areas o f need during the CPS 
implementation period.’’ Also, in the past, the Bank has made available to the authorities 
o f the treasury services i t offers to help the country navigate external shocks. A future 
area o f engagement may consist, precisely, in a more active use o f those s e r v i c e s . 
Continued prudent economic management w i l l be c r i t ica l to reduce the l ike l ihood and 
impact o f such shocks. The risk associated w i t h external shocks and natural disasters i s 
assessed as high.

Other donors are actively helping Paraguay develop i t s natural disaster response capacity.

PARAGUAY: CAS Completion Report 
Da te o f CAS: November 26,2003: Report No . 27341-PA 
Period covered by the CAS Completion Report: FY04 -FY08 
CAS Completion Report completed by: Frank Eanvaker, Consultant, September 2008 

Summary 

This document evaluates the achievement o f CAS objectives i n Paraguay together w i th the respective contributions o f the 
Government and the Bank. 

The 2003 CAS was prepared at a time when Paraguay was emerging from a long period o f economic decline and deepening 
poverty. After President Nicador Duarte Frutos was elected i n A p r i l 2003 he espoused a far-reaching agenda o f structural 
and policy reforms aimed at correcting fiscal imbalances, fostering growth and reducing poverty. A t the same time, he 
sought to restore confidence i n Government and encourage greater c iv ic participation. 

The Bank responded positively and promptly by preparing a CAS based upon discussions w i th the new administration. 
Fo l low ing upon a long period o f low Bank activity in Paraguay and l i t t l e lending, the CAS was structured i n terms o f re- 
engagement. I t proposed a strong program o f lending and AAA for the CAS period FY04-07 . I t was later on decided not to 
extend the CAS period to FY08 through a Progress Report, but rather to wait for the new administration to take office i n 
order to synchronize the CSP period w i th the electoral cycle and design a new CSP which more adequately reflected the new 
administration’s priotrities 

The operational re-engagement o f the Bank under the FY04-07 CAS began w i th an Economic Recovery SA L (ERL) that 
was presented to the Board in December 2003 along w i th the CAS. The ERL successfully provided financial support for the 
Government’s short- and medium-term action program i n the areas o f fiscal stabilization, deficit reduction, taxation,, public 
administration. financial sector reform, pension reform and the f igh t against corruption. Results in terms o f renewed 
economic growth and poverty reduction exceeded the targets o f the CAS . 

The CAS envisaged substantial additional ad.justment lending in the financial sector but that had to be scaled back because 
the financial sector reform agenda d id not move forward on as broad a front as expected. A t the same time, differences 
emerged between the executive and the legislature which made i t d i f f icu l t for the Government to get Congressional approval 
for external loans as required by the national constitution. As a result, some Bank loans were withdrawn or cancelled before 
loan signingieffectiveness. O f the 13 lending operations envisaged i n the base-case CAS scenario only four were approved 
and became effective. 

I t i s now clear that the CAS overestimated the prospects for Bank lending under a new administration and actual lending f e l l 
far short o f the CAS program. Nevertheless, the Bank was able to re-engage effectively w i th Paraguay. Even when projects 
were dropped, withdrawn or cancelled the Bank was able to achieve positive results i n helping the reform agenda move 
forward w i th other instruments such as grant financing and analytic work. Project preparation work also contributed directly 
to progress w i th the Government’s reform agenda, particularly i n areas such as financial management and budgeting. 
The program o f AAA envisaged in the 2003 CAS was effectively delivered. An assessment o f AAA i n Paraguay by a Q A G 
panel concluded that the program was h igh ly satisfactory i n terms o f i t s strategic relevance to the i s s u e s confronting 
Paraguay. I n many cases analytic work was undertaken in cooperation w i th other international agencies inc lud ing the IMF , 
the I D B and the European Union. I t has served to advance and enhance the policy dialogue w i th the Government. As a 
result, the Bank and Paraguay are now we l l placed to move ahead further w i th a broad-based po l icy dialogue backed by 
selective lending operations strategically targeted at areas where the Bank can contribute most effectively to foster growth 
and reduce poverty.

I. INTRODUCT ION 

1. 

The FY04-07 Country Assistance Strategy for Paraguay was written at a time when 
the outlook for Paraguay appeared brighter than i t had for many years past. The country 
was emerging from a long period o f economic stagnation during which time income per 
capita (according to the World Bank Atlas methodology) had fallen from US$1,8 I O in 1998 
to US$1,170 in 2002 and 46 percent o f the population had fallen below the poverty line. 
Poor economic performance had been exacerbated by declining world prices for soybean 
and cotton exports and by financial turmoil in neighboring countries, including a 
devaluation o f the Brazilian currency in 1999 and an economic collapse o f Argentina in 
December 200 1 . 
2. With the election o f President Nicador Duarte Frutos in Ap r i l 2003, a window o f 
opportunity was opened for reforms that could arrest and reverse the economic decline o f 
Paraguay. The new administration espoused a structural reform agenda that focused on 
f i v e key areas: (i) correcting f i s c a l imbalances; (ii) restoring confidence in government; 
( i i i ) fostering economic growth with social equity; (iv) reducing poverty; and (v) 
encouraging greater civic participation in government. The Government moved quickly to 
build a coalition o f support for i t s reform agenda and a lso sought the support o f the 
international financial community. The Bank responded promptly by preparing Policy 
Notes that served as a basis for discussions with the Government on critical policy issues.’ 
Following those discussions the Bank also prepared a CAS that was presented to the Board 
together with an Economic Recovery SAL in December 2003 - only four months after the 
new administration took office. I n parallel to those efforts, the Government reached an 
agreement with the IM F on a 15 month stand-by arrangement. Other international and 
bilateral financial institutions, including the IDB, were also forthcoming in extending 
support. 

11. PARAGUAY’S NAT IONAL DEVELOPMENT GOALS 

3 . 

4. 

The Government clearly explained i t s development strategy in a 
letter o f 
development policy dated November 19, 2003 and delivered to the Bank in the context o f 
an Economic Recovery SAL. Additional and more detailed information on economic and 
financial policies were contained in a Letter o f Intent dated December 5, 2003 and 
delivered to the IMF in the context o f a 1 5 month stand-by agreement. 
I n i t s l e t t e r o f development policy the Government candidly acknowledged that many 
years o f economic stagnation had exacerbated poverty and insecurity in Paraguay. I t also 
acknowledged serious shortcomings in the ability o f the Government i t s e l f to provide basic 
infrastructure and soc ia l services. The situation called for a radical change in the country’s 
development model and, in articulating the vision, objectives and strategic guidelines for a 
medium-term program o f action, the Government identified four strategic objectives. 
The first strategic objective was to restore confidence in the State and its 
representatives. To that end, the Government undertook to modernize the public 
administration, make i t more e f f i c i e n t , more transparent and l e s s prone to corruption. I n 
particular, state institutions were to operate within a clearly defined rules-based framework 
and their performance would be assessed on the basis o f results.

7. 

A second strategic objective was to foster an active participation o f the citizenry i n 
building democratic institutions. I n that context, the Government would seek to involve 
civic society in the processes o f policy formulation and program implementation. The 
country’s “social capital” would be enhanced by strengthening the institutional framework 
o f citizen cooperation. 
A th i rd strategic objective was to revitalize economic growth and employment by 
investing in physical and human capital w i th in the context o f a sound macroeconomic 
framework. The need to strengthen financial sector institutions and restore sound 
management to f i s c a l and monetary policy was clearly understood. In particular, there was 
an urgent need to regain control o f the public finances and place them on a basis that would 
be sustainable in the long-term. 
The fourth strategic objective was to fight poverty, corruption and insecurity. 
Programs o f basic health care, and education were to be strengthened and extended to 
sections o f the population that were underserved. Likewise, basic infrastructure services 
including low-income housing were to be provided to lower-income communities. 

111. THE BANK’S PROGRAM OF SUPPORT 

9 . 

The program proposed i n the CAS was broadly supportive o f the Government’s 
program while recognizing that progress would depend critically upon the effectiveness 
w i th which the authorities pursued structural and policy reform. Since there had been a 
long period o f low Bank activity in Paraguay and little lending, the CAS was structured i n 
terms o f re-engagement. The proposed strategy took into account a long-history o f 
political difficulties and institutional weaknesses that had obstructed reform efforts in the 
past. 
In a situation which was recognized to be “high risk / high reward” the CAS 
incorporated clear performance criteria according to which lending would be tied to the 
administration’s progress in matters o f economic management and reform. A base case 
lending scenario was proposed subject t o compliance w i th key triggers in public 
administration, f i s c a l and financial sec to r r e f o rm s and portfolio implementation. I f the 
triggers were not met, lending was to revert to a core program o f investments in support o f 
the millennium development goals. The CAS also included a high case scenario although i t 
was acknowledged that Paraguay was unlikely to meet the c r i te r ia for the high case un t i l 
the latter years o f the CAS period a t best. W i th in those constraints, the proposed program 
o f Bank assistance was based on four pillars. 
10. .The first pillar was to support key structural reforms needed to stabilize the public 
finances and strengthen the financial sector. A n Economic Recovery SAL was presented to 
the Board at the same time as the CAS and i t provided financial support commensurate 
w i th an ambitious program o f reforms that the new administration had submitted to 
Congress for approval. The intention was that a stable structure o f public f inances and a 
strengthened banking system would bolster the confidence o f private investors and thereby 
lay the foundation for sustained economic recovery. Analytic work was also envisaged to 
advance the Bank’s dialogue on key economic reforms. 
11. A second pillar o f Bank support was to a s s i s t the Government in i t s effort to improve 
governance and the transparency o f public administration. I t was envisaged that support 
would be provided though a s e r i e s o f technical assistance loans and grants. I n that context, 
loan to transform the M in is t ry o f Finance into a “ministry o f excellence” by 
a 
professionalizing the c i v i l service s ta f f , upgrading internal procedures and controls and by 

Annex 2 
Page 4 o f 27 

reorienting i t s institutional goals towards service to the public, was viewed as a flagship 
project to be followed by similar initiatives in other ministries and at other levels o f 
government including municipalities which would then be better prepared to accept 
responsibility for decentralized public services. 
I t was envisaged that the operations 
program would be supported and complemented by ana ly t i c work including a land tax 
study and an institutional and governance review. 
12. A third pillar o f the CAS was to support sustainable growth by helping to improve the 
business environment and thereby foster private sector development. A t the same time, 
special attention was to be given to increasing production and productivity in rural areas 
where the majority o f the poor live. A wide range o f initiatives was envisaged, including 
investments in rural roads and i n water supply and sanitation. Agricultural extension and 
natural resource management were to be upgraded and support would be provided for 
sustainable forestry management w i th a view to developing Paraguay’s huge potential for 
forestry products. 
13 . The fourth pillar for Bank support focused on the Government’s program for social 
inclusion - closely linked to poverty reduction and rural-based growth. Support was to be 
provided for systemic social sector reforms to better target the rural poor including 
outreach to the indigenous population. A program o f lending and A A A was proposed in 
such areas as education reform, maternal and child health insurance, social protection and 
pension reform. 

I V . CAS OUTCOMES 

16. 

14. The 2003 CAS was results based. Explicit country performance indicators were 
specified i n a CAS Program Matrix, which i s included a t the end o f this completion report 
as Attachment 1 along w i th actual outcomes. N o clear distinction was made i n the CAS 
between overall country indicators and indicators specific to the CAS i t s e l f . 
15 . Actual outcomes for the country performance indicators were mixed. I n broad t e r m s 
the outcomes for f i s c a l and financial stabilization were generally good, as were the 
outcomes w i th respect to sustainable growth, B y way o f contrast, outcomes in the areas o f 
governance and social inclusion f e l l far short o f the targets in many cases. 
I t i s c l e a r in restrospect that the CAS was overly optimistic w i th respect to the 
structural and policy reforms that could be successfully implemented by a new 
administration. Notwithstanding the bold reform agenda that was articulated by President 
Nicador Duarte Frutos when he first took office, the administration underestimated the 
challenges in delivering such an ambitious program, particularly those related to 
governance and institutional competence. N o t only did outcomes f a l l short o f targets but 
progress was slower than envisaged in many areas. 
I t i s also c l e a r in restrospect that the CAS overestimated the prospects and 
possibilities for new lending in areas where the Bank had previously only a limited 
presence. The CAS proposed a base-case lending program o f thirteen operations but only 
four o f them were approved and became effective. In many cases the shortfall was directly 
related to the inability o f Government to obtain legislative approval for projects that were 
well prepared and ready for implementation. I n other cases, the high priority given to 
reforms such as those in the financial sector and social security diminished as time passed. 

17. 

Annex 2 
Page 5 o f 27 

18 . However, when due allowance i s made for the initially ambitious targets, steady and 
significant headway was made i n the overall country relationship w i th Paraguay. The 
country dialouge has flourished both at the macro level and at the sector level, underpinned 
by a high-quality program o f ana ly t ic and advisory work. Overall project implementation 
has been good and in some sectors, such as transport and water supply, the Bank has helped 
with the introduction o f innovative development strategies. Even when projects were 
withdrawn or cancelled, the Bank was able to contribute to moving the reform agenda 
forward by mobilizing other intruments such as grant financing. During the CAS period the 
Bank deepened i t s engagement in Paraguay and became a strong partner. The Bank’s 
recent broader involvement in issues o f governance and the adoption o f Paraguay as a pilot 
country fo r the GAC initiative i s further evidence o f a deeper and broader country 
relationship. 

P i l la r I : Fiscal and F inanc ia l Stabilization 

Overview 

19. This pillar o f the CAS was clearly perceived as an urgent priority driven by the 
difficult economic circumstances confronting the Government when i t took office in 
August, 2003. Country outcomes were good as evidenced by a consistently strong 
economic performance throughout the CAS period. The indicative indicators that were 
targeted in the CAS were largely achieved as shown in Attachment 1. CAS outcomes were 
good ove ra l l . Although a flagship Economic Recovery SAL was outstandingly successful, 
a follow-up Financial Sector Adjustment Loan had to be reduced i n scope and content 
because the pace o f reform was slower than anticipated. Analytic work undertaken by the 
Bank was strategically relevant and o f high quality. 

Macroeconomic Performance 
20. By most indicators Paraguay has performed better than anticipated during the 
2004-07 CAS period. 

I t can be seen from Table 1 below that real GDP growth has 
averaged 4.4 percent compared with only 3 percent projected i n the CAS. The driving 
fo rces behind that growth have been threefold. First, macroeconomic management was 
generally sound. Second, the strong performance o f neighboring countries, particularly 
Argentina and Brazil, had a ripple e f f e c t . Third, Paraguay has benefited from strong 
commodity prices with exports growing at c lose to 3 5 percent a year i n nominal dollar 
terms. However, by the same token, Paraguay i s now even more vulnerable to external 
shocks because imports have also grown at a rapid pace that may be unsustainable i f the 
external economic environment were to deteriorate. Another crisis in neighboring 
countries or a roll-back in commodity prices would have serious repercussions fo r 
Paraguay. 
21. Macroeconomic management was generally sound during the CAS period. The IMF 
affirmed that performance under the 2003 stand-by arrangement was satisfactory and 
largely achieved the objectives o f restoring stability and starting a reform process t o create 
conditions for sustained growth and poverty reduction. Another stand-by arrangement was 
requested by the Government on a precautionary basis and i t was approved in May, 2006. 
I n the context o f a f i f th review o f the arrangement in December 2007, IM F s t a f f stated that 
“A l l quantitative performance criteria established for end-September 2006 under the IMF- 
supported program were met, and the expectation i s that quantitative targets for end- 
December 2007 w i l l also be observed.” I t i s particularly noteworthy that the relative s ize o f 

public sector debt has declined much more rapidly that was anticipated in the CAS. I t now 
stands at a manageable 20 percent o f GDP.

The Bank program o f support 
22. 
I n parallel to the CAS, the Bank prepared an Economic Recovery Structural 
Adjustment Loan (ERL) in the amount o f U S 3 0 million to support the Government’s 
reform program. The CAS and the ERL were presented to the Board together in 
December 2003, just four months after the new administration took o f f i c e . By providing 
financial support for the Government’s short- and medium-term action program in the areas 
o f f i s c a l stabilization and deficit reduction, taxation, public administration, financial sector 
reform, pension reform and the fight against corruption, the ERL contributed directly to 
f i s c a l and financial stabilization as well as other objectives identified i n a l l four pillars o f 
the CAS. 
23. The ERL was structured as a single tranche operation to help Paraguay more 
effectively finance the large financing gap that was revealed in 2003. A set o f policy 
actions was identified as a condition for Board presentation and a second se t o f benchmark 
indicators was identified to assess the continuity o f progress in the reform program after the 
formal closing date o f the loan. I t was anticipated that follow-up loans, such as a planned 
Financial Sector Adjustment Loan, would provide a vehicle for monitoring and ensuring 
continuity o f the Government’s reform program. 
24. An implementation completion report for this operation found the achievement o f 
project objectives t o be satisfactory or highly satisfactory. By providing early support to 
the administration’s economic and institutional reform agenda, the ERL helped the 
Government avoid a severe financial crisis, meet its short-term debt obligations and gain 
time to restore a f i s c a l balance. 
25. Fulfillment o f the f i s c a l stabilization objective in particular was highly satisfactory. 
An overall f i s c a l deficit amounting to 3 .1 percent o f GDP in 2002 was turned around t o a 
surplus in 2004 that exceeded the target established by the IMF Stand-By arrangement. 
The improvement was the result o f a strong increase i n public revenues together with tight 
control over public spending. 

Annex 2 

Page 7 o f 2 7 

26. 
Tax policy objectives were also met satisfactorily. 
During 2004 tax revenues 
increased by 36 percent (or 2 percent o f GDP) over the previous year as a result o f efforts 
to reduce evasion and corruption, and increase efficiency. The approval o f a Tax Reform 
Law i n July 2004 was an important breakthrough which introduced new revenue 
instruments, broadened the value-added tax and extended the coverage o f the company 
income tax to agriculture and ranching. 
27. Progress i n putting the public sector pension system on a sound financial footing was 
also satisfactory. In December 2003 Congress enacted measures to reduce the financial 
deficit o f the system and introduce greater consistency between pension plans. Specific 
changes included raising the contribution rate from 14 to 16 percent and raising the 
mandatory retirement age to a uniform 62 years across the board. 
28. Financial sec tor objectives were also met satisfactorily. The enactment o f a Deposit 
Guarantee and Bankruptcy Law would make i t eas ie r to resolve another banking crisis i f 
one were to arise in the future. The public sector’s contingent liabilities were thereby 
effectively reduced. 
29. Finally, there was satisfactory progress in meeting the program objectives w i th 
respect to a more e f f i c i e n t and l e s s corrupt public administration. A new Customs Code 
was adopted i n 2004 to modernize procedures and curtail corruption. Public procurement 
practices were improved and information on public procurement was posted on the internet. 
A census o f public sector employees was undertaken to help rationalize the management o f 
human resources. 
30. Collectively, these achievements constituted a propitious beginning for the new 
administration and vindicated Bank support through the ERL. 
3 1 . The CAS envisaged additional follow-up support for financial sector adjustment 
w i th a financial sector adjustment loan (FSAL). A Program Document proposing a two- 
tranche FSAL i n the amount o f US$60 m i l l ion was distributed to the Board o f Executive 
Directors i n August 2004 but i t was subsequently withdrawn to allow the Government 
further time to submit a new banking law to Congress and thereby satisfy a condition o f 
Board approval. A draft banking law, satisfactory to the Bank, was eventually submitted to 
Congress in December 2004. However, Board presentation o f the FSAL was also 
conditioned upon other financial sector reforms which did not proceed as smoothly as 
anticipated. To better manage perceived risks to the program posed by uncertain progress 
w i th the reform agenda, the Bank and the Government agreed to a strategy o f risk 
mitigation whereby Bank support for Paraguay’s financial sector reforms would be 
restructured on a programmatic basis. Under this approach, a sequence o f three single- 
tranche programmatic financial sector loans was envisaged. They were to be presented to 
the Board in line w i th measurable progress in the reform program. Bank support was to be 
back-loaded to r e f l e c t the perceived increased risk. 
32. The first o f this sequence, a programmatic financial sector adjustment loan (PFSAL I) 
i n an amount o f U S $ 1 5 million, was approved i n Ap r i l 2005. I t provided up-front support 
for prior reforms. The Government encountered a long delay i n securing Congressional 
approval for the loan and the deadline for effectiveness had to be extended beyond the 
customary 18 month Bank policy deadline. The delay i n Congress did not necessarily 
reflect a lack o f Congressional support for financial sector reform. Other Bank loans were 
similarly blocked at the time as well as loans from other international and bilateral financial 
organizations. The situation was reflective o f a wider political confrontation that resulted 

Annex 2 
Page 8 o f 2 7 

in a stale-mate between the executive and the legislature. As a resu l t , some other Bank 
loans had to be cancelled. In parallel to PFSAL I, a Financial Sector Strengthening 
Technical Assistance Loan was designed to ass is t Paraguay with the modernization o f i t s 
financial system by strengthening the Superintendence o f Banks, streamlining the 
settlement o f payments and monitoring the progress o f other financial reforms. However, 
the loan was withdrawn after the Central Bank decided that did not wish t o finance 
technical assistance with loan funds. 
33 . Notwithstanding these difficulties, the implementation completion report for PFSAL 
I indicated that the Government has remained in compliance with the reforms supported by 
the loan and there have also been advances in other areas that were to be supported by 
subsequent Bank loans.2 However, overall progress was insufficient to justify moving 
forward with additional Bank support for the program although the Bank continued its 
policy dialogue with the Government and stood ready to provide an effective response to 
new financial sector initiatives. 
34. Among the achievements o f PFSAL I which s t i l l remain in e f f e c t , the following merit 
particular mention. The Central Bank established specific criteria to identify troubled 
financial institutions so that measures may be taken to improve their financial condition. 
Financial institutions were prohibited from pledging their asse ts as security for deposits 
held by persons in the same institution. The Government reached an agreement with 
commercial banks to renegotiate public bonds. The Central Bank established norms 
concerning asset classification, loan loss reserves, accrued interest payments and 
refinancing operations as they apply to bank lending. The Central Bank also approved a 
strategic plan to improve banking supervision. A draft banking law was submitted to 
Congress in 2004 although i t has not yet been enacted. Amendments to simplify the draft 
law are currently being considered. A draft law to combat money-laundering was also 
submitted to Congress in 2004 although i t took until December 2007 for Congress to 
approve a new penal code for money laundering. Under Paraguayan law, the 
implementation o f the new penal code w i l l be delayed for one year t o allow fo r the training 
o f judges and prosecutors. 
35 . The Bank closely coordinated the design o f PFSAL I and the broader underlying 
program with both the IMF and the IDB . A t the time o f loan approval, the IM F had had in 
place a stand-by program which included structural benchmarks for financial sector reform. 
The IMF continued to monitor financial sector developments under a follow-up stand-by 
arrangement which the Government entered on a precautionary basis. The IDB has 
focused, in particular, on assisting Paraguay with the consolidation o f state owned banks 
and with developing a regulatory framework for the cooperatives sector. 
36. The operational program in support o f fiscal and financial stabilization was 
accompanied by analytic wo r k in key areas. A review o f the Paraguay country A A A 
was undertaken by a QAG panel which found that, in terms o f its strategic relevance, the 
program was highly satisfactory. This finding was particularly applicable to the analytic 
work in the areas o f f isca l and financial stabilization. 
I n 2005 a Financial Sector Assessment was undertaken at the request o f the 
Government and in the context o f the joint IMF-World Bank Financial Sector Assessment 

37.

Annex 2 
Page 9 o f 27 

Program (FSAP).3 The Assessment noted that the recovery o f the economy provided a 
window o f opportunity to address key financial vulnerabilities that would otherwise pose 
an obstacle to future growth. I t advocated a more comprehensive e f f o r t to financial sector 
reform that would contribute to building trust in the financial system. 
I t made specific 
recommendations for strengthening the prudential regulation o f the fast-growing credit 
cooperatives sector, drastically restructuring the BNF (a publicly owned bank), overhauling 
insolvency procedures, regulating pension funds and upgrading the payments system. 
Those issues continue to figure prominently in the policy and reform dialogue between the 
Government, the IMF, the IDB and the Bank. 
38 . A public expenditure review was also undertaken in 2006.4 I t advocated revenue 
raising measures to provide additional resources for needed investments in basic 
infrastructure and social s e r v i c e s which are presently insufficient for economic growth. A t 
the same time i t underscored the importance o f controlling the growth o f current 
expenditures, especially with respect to public sec to r wages. I t noted that public 
employment, in addition to consuming an overly large proportion o f public spending i s 
structured according to patronage rather than discharging the functions o f the s ta te . I t also 
advocated strengthening the presently weak budget process to better prioritize investments 
and facilitate the e f f e c t i v e delivery o f public services. The effectiveness o f the review was 
enhanced by a concise executive summary which clearly identified the principal 
recommendations for policy makers. 
39. O f particular significance was an Integrated Fiduciary Assessment (IFA) undertaken 
by the Bank with support from the IDB and the European Union.’ The Assessment was the 
first o f i t s kind in Paraguay and it incorporated the indicators-based methodologies o f 
PEFA and o f OECD-DAC which provided crucial insights into the efficiency and 
credibility o f the budget and procurement processes. I n the absence o f lending, the IFA has 
become a key instrument for a continuing policy dialogue with the Ministry o f Finance. 
Seminars were held with the Ministry to review the resu l ts o f the IFA and non-lending 
technical assistance was mobilized t o help the Ministry design an ac t ion plan. The 
collaborative manner in which the IFA was undertaken enabled the Government to take 
ownership o f the process and o f the product. That, in turn, made i t a more effective 
instrument for improved f i s c a l management. 
40. Other analytic work that clearly had a bearing on f i s c a l and financial stabilization as 
well as other pillars o f the CAS included (i) a study o f Real Property Taxation which 
constitutes a major, but as yet underutilized, source o f revenue for sub-national government 
and (ii) a Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA). Both tasks contributed 
effectively to the country dialogue. Technical assistance to the Ministry o f Finance for 
improved governance and transparency (reviewed under P i l la r 2 below) also contributed to 
better f i s c a l management.

administration. However, country outcomes were mixed and generally f e l l short of the 
targeted indicative indicators (see Attachment I). Paraguay improved i t s relative ranking in 
the Corruption Index o f Transparency International but did not rise from the fifth to the 
fourth quintile as targeted. The Bank program o f assistance likewise f e l l short o f the CAS 
objectives but nevertheless helped the authorities improve governance and transparency in 
a number o f key areas. 
The Bank program o f support 
42. The most prominent instrument o f Bank support for improved governance and 
transparency was a project f o r the modernization of the M in is t ry o f Finance. The 
scope o f the proposed project was ambitious and the goal was to transform the Ministry 
into a “ministry o f excellence” by streamlining i t s in te rna l procedures, professionalizing the 
s t a f f and strengthening a tradition o f service towards the public. I t was envisaged that 
improved management practices within the Ministry o f Finance would be linked to similar 
improvements in line ministries such as Education which was a lso aiming to improve 
management practices with Bank assistance from an ongoing Education Reform Loan. 
Hence, the modernization o f the Ministry o f Finance was envisaged as a stepping stone to 
parallel changes in other ministries and eventually t o other levels o f the public 
administration including municipalities. 
43. The modernization loan was approved by the Board on Apr i l 5, 2005 in an amount o f 
US$7.5 million. There was a considerable delay before the loan was signed because the 
Government first waited for Congress to approve a financial sector adjustment loan to 
which the modernization loan was linked. Once the loan was sent to Congress, it became 
clear that prospects for timely Congressional approval were remote and the Bank decided 
to cancel the loan in March 2007. 
I n part, the lack o f Congressional approval for the modernization loan reflected 
differences between the executive and the legislature that resulted in a stalemate. However, 
there was also widespread resistance to the idea that Government should borrow externally 
to finance technical assistance especially when grant funding i s available from many 
bilateral donors for that purpose. I n addition, the ambitious scope o f the project may have 
provoked resistance from a conservative and cautious bureaucracy. 
45. Yet the cancellation o f this loan did not presage an end to modernization and reform 
in the Ministry o f Finance. The modernization agenda continued to move forward i n a 
number o f areas, albeit at a more moderate pace, and the Bank continued to play a role with 
resources from trust funds in some cases. An IDF grant remained active until 2007 and i t 
financed a number o f initiatives that had been identified and targeted in the course o f loan 
preparation. I n part it financed analytic work aimed a t enhancing the broader framework o f 
f isca l management such as public sec tor deficit financing, an analysis o f social 
expenditures within the budget and the adoption o f multi-year budgeting. Other initiatives 
financed by the IDF grant were more administrative and organizational. They included the 
development o f guidelines for public hearings on contracting; a seminar on procurement; 
the design o f security systems fo r an electronic data base; a workshop on monitoring and 
evaluation and the purchase o f hardware and software for that purpose; equipment, training 
and technical assistance for the Transparency Office o f the Ministry and; the design o f a 
data base for the management o f human resources. Supervision revealed that a l l those 
initiatives were effective in helping the Ministry o f Finance improve i t s operational 
efficiency . 

44. 

Annex 2 
Page 1 1 o f 27 

46. The Bank also provided support f o r improved management efficiency in the 
Ministry o f Education. One o f the primary objectives o f the Education Reform APL that 
was approved in June 2003 was to a s s i s t Paraguay improve the management and efficiency 
o f the education system by “creating additional capacity for sector analysis, planning, 
monitoring and evaluation, and improving management and development of human 
resources’’.6 The. project successfully pursued that objective during the CAS period. By 
June 2008, the revised closing date, a model for the selection and contracting o f personnel 
had been designed, approved and implemented nationwide. Certification and accreditation 
policies had also been designed and approved and w i l l start to be implemented in 2008. The 
entire administrative planning and budgetary systems have been re-engineered and, in 
Decmber 2008, the new system w i l l be introduced to the Ministry o f Education and to the 
Department o f Asuncion on a pilot basis. I t i s anticipated that the improved planning and 
budgetary systems w i l l increase efficiency and contribute to greater transparency and the 
better management o f human resources. 
47. The CAS also envisaged a deeper extension o f governance and public sector 
reform to improve fiscal management at the municipal level. However, a municipal 
finance project proposed in the base case program was not prepared. I n part, that was 
because the project would focus on a better application o f the real property tax which i s the 
main (but greatly underutilized) source o f municipal revenue. Until a study o f the rea l 
property tax was undertaken, the analytic underpinning o f the project could not be put in 
place. 
48. A r e a l property tax study was finalized towards the end o f the CAS period.’ 
I t 
concluded that the current yield o f the tax i s far below international norms. To inc rease the 
yield without incurring the expense and long gestation period o f creating a fu l l national 
cadastre, i t proposed a revision o f the property tax law based on the principle o f s e l f - 
assessment o f property values that has worked well in many other countries. A s e l f - 
assessment system could quickly develop a market value tax base that would greatly 
improve the revenues o f l o c a l government while, at the same time, create incentives for the 
more e f f e c t i v e and efficient use o f rural land resources. The study provides valuable 
source material that could constitute a strong analytic base for addressing governance 
issues at the l o c a l level in Paraguay going forward. 
49. The World Bank Institute has also been active in Paraguay ever since 2000 when 
the Government invited the W B I to give orientation and training to representatives o f 
civil society on how other countries have approached the issue o f corruption. With 
WB I support, a Government-sponsored Anti-Corruption Commission (later renamed the 
National Integrity Commission) developed a plan to combat corruption in the three areas o f 
customs, procurement and the judiciary. The Commission presented its plan to the donor 
community and the ID B responded with support for additional work on procurement and 
on customs. The Bank focused on the judiciary and, in that context, mobilized an IDF 
grant to support Paraguay’s legal and judicial reform. The grant focused on assisting the 
Supreme Court in three areas as follows: (i) strengthening the judicial function; (ii) 
improving the administrative framework o f the judiciary; and (iii) strengthening the public 
registries and judicial s t a t i s t i c s . The grant effectively complemented technical assistance 
provided by the IDB , UNDP and USA ID and successfully achieved its strategic objective

o f strengthening the capacity o f the Supreme Court and the Council o f Magistrates to 
perform their functions. 
IDF grants were also mobilized in support o f Paraguay’s civil service reform 
and to assist the National Congress streamline i t s internal procedures and gain ready 
access to legislative information, With respect to c iv i l service reform, grant funds were 
successfully employed to strengthen the National Secretariat for Public Administration 
(NSPA) by helping to develop an action plan for training key personnel and for upgrading 
personnel data. As a result, in 2004, the NSPA designed and carried out a national census 
o f public employees to provide up-to-date and reliable information for the management o f 
human resources. Support for the modernization o f Paraguay’s Congress began in 2005 
and continued beyond the end o f the CAS period. I t includes support for (i) improving the 
channels o f communication by updating the Congressional website, ( i i) adopting best 
practices from internationally recognized legislative bodies including the establishment o f a 
congressional research center, (iii) accessing the Global Legal Information Network 
(GLIN) system and (iv) increasing transparency and efficiency through an electronic 
document management system, modernizing the Library o f Congress and establishing a 
workflow management system t o manage and monitor legislative initiatives. 

P i l lar 3 : Sustainable Growth 

Overview 
51 . Growth i s a multi-sector endeavor and the program envisaged by the CAS for this 
pillar was correspondingly multi-faceted. 
I t included support fo r the development o f 
infrastructure; investment in agriculture and forestry; and support for private sector 
development. Progress was made in a l l o f these areas but a t a slower pace than had been 
envisaged in the CAS. Nevertheless, country outcomes were generally good with respect 
to indicative targets as documented in Attachment I. CAS outcomes varied greatly from 
sector to sector. I n sectors where the Bank had a long-standing presence progress was 
generally satisfactory. However, the CAS was not able to move forward in new areas such 
as private sector development and municipal development. 
Agriculture and Forestry 
52 . A sustainable ru ra l investment project was programmed for FY05 but was 
postponed to allow f o r the completion o f an ongoing Na tu ra l Resources Management 
Project (PARN) and a thorough evaluation o f its outcome. Although that project dated 
from the mid-nineties, the loan was not closed until 2006. Hence, a significant part o f 
project implementation took place during the period o f the 2003-07 CAS. Notwithstanding 
implementation problems which had resulted in delays and necessitated major restructuring 
a f t e r a mid-term review, the project achieved most o f i t s objectives satisfactorily. As a 
result o f the project, the implementation completion report concluded that improved natural 
resource management and more sustainable approaches to agriculture are now an accepted 
paradigm in Paraguay while participatory decision-making and working with smallholder 
farmers and indigenous peoples i s more commonplace.* The infrastructure development 
component o f the project was also rated satisfactory and some 400 km o f l o c a l roads were 
rehabilitated. However, the institutional development component o f the project was rated 
unsatisfactory due principally to an overly ambitious attempt to decentralize while, at the 
same time, coordinating many agencies and attempting to strengthen weak institutions.

5 3 . The successor project that had been anticipated fo r FY05 was prepared as a 
Sustainable Agriculture and Rural Development Project (SARD) in 2006-07 and a loan for 
U S $ 3 7 . 5 m i l l ion received Board approval in January 2008. The project drew upon the 
lessons learned from P A W and also from the experience gained from an ongoing 
Community Development Project (PRODECO). Whereas the 2003 CAS had envisaged 
that 
the micro-catchment model for agricultural extension and natural resource 
management would be expanded nation-wide, the project area was delimited more 
manageably to 39 municipalities in the two poorest departments o f the Eastern Region o f 
Paraguay. Other lessons incorporated into the successor project included an effective and 
transparent process o f participatory and decentralized planning and decision making; 
flexibility to accommodate the culturally-defined decision making mechanisms o f different 
ethnic groups; and strong support from technical agencies to the beneficiaries. The PARN 
further effectively included indigenous people as project beneficiaries. This i s a positive 
lesson from experience and indigenous communities w i l l continue to be actively included 
as beneficiaries under PRODERS. 
54. The implementation difficulties encountered with PARN and the delay in preparing a 
successor project serve to underscore the need for careful project design and preparation 
even a t the cost o f extending the time-horizon. A Forestry Development Project, initially 
programmed fo r FY06 was put on hold pending a clearer definition o f the Government’s 
position v is-&v is the regulatory framework for sustainable forestry management including 
transport regulation, pricing and royalties, plantations and reforestation. The projecthas 
now been cancelled. . Meanwhile, GEF resources have been mobilized t o support a 
Maracayu Nature Park Reserve project and more GEF finance i s proposed fo r supporting 
biodiversity in areas that w i l l overlap the SARD project. 
5 5 . Analytic work in support o f lending for agriculture and forestry included the study o f 
Real Property Taxation already cited above. That study c i t e s evidence pointing t o a 
considerable underutilization o f land and i t suggests that the absence o f significant tax 
revenues from rural land enables underutilized land to be held without cost. A conclusion 
o f the study i s that a well structured reform o f land taxation could well enhance the 
efficiency o f land use in rural areas. 
I t also suggests that, in view o f the widespread 
deforestation that has occurred in the past, a new land tax exemption for natural forests 
managed i n a sustainable manner could be an effective instrument to encourage 
environmental conservation. 

Infrastructure 
56 . A loan in the amount o f US$74 million f o r a Road Maintenance Project was 
approved in August 2006 as envisaged in the CAS. I n many ways the project marked a 

new beginning for the Bank in the road sector o f Paraguay, notwithstanding a history o f 
previous loans fo r highways in the eighties and nineties. Whereas earlier projects had 
focused on building new roads, the 2006 project i s concerned with road maintenance. The 
development objective o f the project i s to establish a sustainable road management strategy 
that ensures the upgrading and maintenance o f the road network making optimal use o f 
scarce resources. That involves developing the institutional capacity o f the Ministry o f 
Public Works, arresting the deterioration o f the priority road network and improving access 
fo r the poorest rural communities. With Bank assistance, Paraguay has been able to 
fundamentally reshape i t s approach to prioritizing road maintenance. 

Annex 2 
Page 14 o f 27 

57. As with many other Bank loans, i t took longer than anticipated to obtain the approval 
o f Congress but the loan became effective i n January 2008. Notwithstanding the delay, the 
Ministry o f Public Works has moved forward with a number o f project activities including 
the preparation o f a Road Strategy, the establishment o f a Road Planning Directorate and 
the adoption o f an action plan to improve procurement and financial management. 
I n 
addition, bidding has begun for the design o f a Road Plan, a budget monitoring system and 
a new toll system. Several elements o f an Improved Governance Framework have been put 
in place and the overall progress o f the project i s judged to be satisfactory by Bank 
supervision s t a f f . 

5 8 . The Bank has had a long association with Paraguay in water supply and 
sanitation. A fourth ru r a l water supply and sanitation project dating from 1997 was 
still under implementation during the first pa r t o f the CAS period. The project was 

innovative in that: (i) i t developed a sustainable model for service delivery through local 
private participation via minimum subsidy concessions; (ii) i t increased access to water 
supply and sanitation for indigenous populations; (iii) i t introduced low-cost piped 
sewerage for small towns; and ( iv ) i t provided for technical assistance to l o c a l Water-User 
Boards through a second-tier system o f water user associations. Most importantly, in 
October 2004, the Government adopted a uniform national policy for financing water and 
sewerage investment in rural areas based on financial policies developed by the Fourth 
Rural Water and Sanitation Project. I n addition, innovative schemes for private sector 
inverstment have been introduced. Altogether this i s an extraordinary achievement that 
few other LAC countries have been able to attain. A Water Sector Modernization project 
that was planned for the last year o f the CAS period i s actively being prepared and i s 
anticipated for FY09. 
59. However, other planned projects have not materialized. A Technical Assistance Loan 
for Private Sector Development was not pursued because the authorities do not favor 
financing technical assistance by borrowing from abroad. A Municipal Services and 
Infrastructure P ro jec t was a lso not pursued, in part because i t was linked to a reform o f the 
Real Property Tax that would increase municipal revenues and provide additional resources 
for local roads, water supply, sanitation and solid waste management. The Bank finalized a 
study o f the Real Property Tax in 2007 but i t may take time fo r the authorities to consider 
i t s recommendations and take action. 
60. The Bank a lso undertook a study o f the Investment Climate in Paraguay for 
submission to the new administration that takes office in 2008. The study was based on 
information from a 2006 survey o f 613 private registered firms operating in Paraguay, o f 
which 25 percent were located in the capital, Asuncion. Hence, the data related exclusively 
to the formal sector o f the economy. Many firms cited unfair competition from the 
informal sector as an obstacle to business because informal businesses did not have to 
comply with the same standards as the corporate sector. The study constitutes a valuable 
source o f information to help the Government identify and relieve perceived bottlenecks 
that constrain private sector development. 

P i l la r 4: Social Inclusion 

Overview 

61. The CAS envisaged a broad program o f Bank support for the Government’s Poverty 
Reduction Strategy, particularly as i t affected education, health, social protection and 
community development. Country outcomes with respect to indicative targets for these 

A n n e x 2 
Page 1 5 o f 27 

sectors were mixed as evidenced in Attachment I. Likewise, CAS outcomes varied greatly 
from sector to sector. There was good progress in meeting objectives in education and 
community development, but outcomes w i th respec t to health and social security f e l l short 
o f the CAS objectives. 
The Bank Program o f Support 
62. An Adaptable Program Loan in the amount o f US%24 million f o r an Education 
Reform Program was approved in July 2003 and was implemented during the CAS 
period. The development objectives o f the program were to improve the management and 
efficiency o f the system and to improve education outcomes and equity o f opportunity in 
secondary education. 
Improvements in management and efficacy were successfully 
achieved as indicated in the section above on governance. Substantial progress was also 
made w i th respect to expanding access to secondary education and improving the quality o f 
education. The net enrollment for secondary schools increased from a base o f 3 3 percent i n 
2001 to 40 percent by end-2007 which constitutes a substantial improvement albeit short o f 
the 44 percent end-of-project target. Also by end-2007, the complete redesign o f 
alternative secondary education programs was well under way based on results from a first 
round o f field testing. The final redesigned modules are expected to be completed by mid- 
2008. A program o f scholarships for low-income students has been introduced and the 
end-project target o f 4,500 scholarships was already reached by 2006. Overall project 
implementation has been successful in reaching i t s development goals. 
63. The Bank also successfully completed an evaluation o f secondary education as 
envisaged i n the CAS.9 The work was done in close collaboration w i th the Ministry o f 
Education and w i th other stakeholders including the IDB. The collaborative nature o f the 
work enhances i t s value as a tool for education management and planning in Paraguay. I t 
w i l l also serve to underpin a second phase o f the adjustable program lending which i s being 
prepared for FY09. 
64. The CAS also envisaged a strong program o f Bank support f o r the health sector 
in Paraguay. Analytic work on the health sector was effectively delivered in 2006.” 
Several conclusions from the report fed directly into a Maternal-Child Basic Health 
Insurance project for which a loan o f US$22 m i l l ion was approved by the Board in Ap r i l 
2005. However, when the Government submitted the loan to Congress it was rejected. The 
reasons for the rejection are threefold. First, i t reflected a stand-off between the executive 
and the legislature that affected many other projects as noted elsewhere. Second, the 
structure o f health care finance i s a contentious issue in Paraguay. Third, there were 
perceptions that a previous Bank loan for a Ma te rna l Health and Ch i ld Development 
Project had failed to achieve the expected results. Indeed, the implementation completion 
report for that earlier project rated the outcome as unsatisfactory and the sector report on 
health service delivery concluded that the project f e l l significantly short o f i t s service 
delivery goals. That shortfall i s reflected in the low utilization o f installed capacity in 
health f a c i l i t i e s which i s l e s s than 50 percent in Paraguay. 
65. Nevertheless, the effort that went into preparing the Maternal-Child Bas ic Health 
Insurance Project has been f ru i t fu l in assisting the Government move forward with a 
number of initiatives that were conceived as part o f the project. The M in is t ry o f Health

66. Social protection was another area identified in the CAS f o r Bank support. 

Analytic work on social protection policies, including the pension system, was delivered in 
2004 as envisaged in the CAS.” The study sought to articulate a strategic vision for social 
protection policies that would embrace programs devoted to the alleviation o f poverty and 
those that seek to provide economic security to the elderly. I t a lso reviewed issues relating 
to the financial management o f soc ia l protection policies. The study was well received and 
many o f the findings were incorporated into a National Strategy to Fight Poverty that was 
adopted by the Government in 2006 and later into a Strategic Plan fo r Reform o f the 
Pensions system that was adopted by the Ministry o f Finance i n 2007. 
67. The CAS a lso envisaged that the Bank would f inance a So c ia l Protection Technical 
Assistance Project. Preparatory work was begun but, by end-2005, i t became c l e a r that the 
authorities were disinclined to finance technical assistance by borrowing externally and 
project preparation was suspended. Nevertheless, the Bank’s preparatory work effectively 
assisted the Government redesign the social security system as documented in a paper 
delivered to the Government in June 2006 and entitled “Pa raguay ; Resultados de l a 
Asistencia Te‘cnica del Banco Mund ia l 2004-2005 a1 Sector de Seguridad S o c i a l ” . 
I n 
addition, the Bank, in cooperation with the IDB, assisted the Government in designing a 
conditional cash transfer program (TEKOPORA) as well as the operational framework o f a 
Fund fo r Soc ia l Equity that was established in 2005. 
68. 

I n 2002, just p r io r to the CAS, the Bank had approved a loan o f US$9 million 
f o r a Pilot Community Development Project (PRODECO ) and the project was 

implemented during the CAS period. PRODECO has proven to be one o f the most 
successful social sector initiatives for addressing the development potential o f the very poor 
in Paraguay. The project sought to test a decentralized, bottom-up development approach 
as a means o f enhancing incomes and increasing the quality o f l i f e o f poor rural and 
marginalized urban communities in three Departments in the south o f the country. The 
project provides grant finance for small-scale demand-driven initiatives prepared and 
submitted by beneficiary groups. Eligible initiatives include income generating projects 
such as artisan workshops as well as community development projects that would 
complement productive investments. A n important component o f PRODECO has been to 
strengthen the capabilities o f local communities to design, implement and monitor income- 
generating and community development initiatives. 
69 . Supervision ratings have been consistently satisfactory both for the development 
objective o f the project and fo r implementation progress. By end-2006 i t had already 
surpassed the quantitative beneficiary targets defined at project appraisal. Some 500 sub- 
projects had been approved benefiting more than 5,100 families and almost 30,000 persons. 
Those figures compare with an original target o f 3,700 families and 18,500 persons. 
Nearly 30 percent o f the sub-projects benefit vulnerable and socially marginalized groups 
(including indigenous peoples, women and youths). That figure exceeds the original target 
by a factor o f 75 percent.

70. A mid-term evaluation o f the project and other monitoring data reveal that the project 
has been able to decentralize decision making to the local level. Reviews o f the quality o f 
supervision show that the project has effectively contributed to a culture o f results, 
transparency and soc ia l participation, although a recent ex-post review o f procurement has 
also highlighted the need to strengthen the oversight o f community-procured TA services. 
PRODECO i s recognized as a key contributor t o the country’s poverty reduction strategy in 
the three departments where i t operated. On that basis the Board approved additional 
funding o f US$9 m i l l ion in March 2008 so that the program may be extended to a further 
f i v e departments. 

V . O V ERA L L BANK PERFORMANCE 

The Lending Program 

7 2 . 

71. The CAS was structured in terms o f the Bank re-engaging with Paraguay after a long 
period o f l i t t l e lending. A base case program o f thirteen loans was envisaged for a total o f 
US$325 million. I n the event, only seven loans were approved during the FY04-07 CAS 
period and in FY08 , but three o f them were either withdrawn or cancelled prior to loan 
effectiveness. O f the remaining six projects proposed i n the CAS, three were dropped. 
Another three were postponed and are likely to be approved i n the following CAS period. 
Total lending in the FY04-08 period amounted to only US$146.5 m i l l ion - l e s s than ha l f o f 
the base-case scenario notwithstanding the fac t that the triggers for base-case lending were 
substantially met (see Attachment 4). 
I n retrospect i t would appear that the base-case lending program proposed i n the CAS 
was overly-ambitious given the country situation at the time. The administration o f 
President Nicador Duarte Frutos began its term o f office in 2003 with far-reaching plans for 
reform and i t was right for the Bank to respond positively. I n order for the reform program 
to be effectively implemented with financing from the Bank, however, the executive branch 
would need to work in close cooperation with the legislature and this proved to be a 
stumbling block. Since Congress, in accordance with the constitution, must approve a l l 
external borrowing, the Bank program was particularly vulnerable to the deadlock that 
quickly emerged. 
73. Even i f Congress had been supportive the successful implementation o f an active 
lending program would have been a challenging task after a long period i n which the Bank 
had only a minimal operational presence in Paraguay. The Bank underestimated the 
support i t would need to provide i n order that Paraguay may reactivate and execute a 
lending program on the scale envisaged. The resident mission in Asunci6n was not 
strengthened commensurately with its expanded responsibilities and i t had to rely on back- 
up support from the Buenos Aires office. 
I n some cases project supervision had to be 
outsourced t o the UNDP. Those shortcomings are only recently being addressed. 
74. Yet i t would be a mistake to infer that the shortfall i n actual lending signified a failure 
of the Bank to reengage effectively with Paraguay. Even when projects were dropped, 
withdrawn o r cancelled the Bank was able to achieve positive results in helping the reform 
agenda move forward with other instruments such as grant financing and analytic work. 
Project preparation work a lso contributed directly to progress with the Government’s 
reform agenda, particularly i n areas such as financial management and budgeting. 
I n 
addition, the program o f A A A was very successful as indicated in the corresponding 
section be low. 

Annex 2 
Page 18 o f 2 7 

Po r t fo l io Quality 

75. Over the 2003-08 period the total active portfolio o f projects under implementation in 
Paraguay averaged only five projects. Because the active portfolio i s so small, performance 
problems that may be encountered w i th just one o r two projects appear to have a large 
e f f e c t on the total portfolio in percentage t e rm s . I t can be seen from Table 2 below that the 
percentage o f projects classified as problem projects or projects a t risk has varied greatly 
from year to year from zero to 100 percent. Hence , the analysis o f aggregated portfolio 
data i s not particularly illuminating in the case o f Paraguay. 
76, Nevertheless, operational experience over the past several years points to a number o f 
special circumstances in Paraguay that frequently impact the performance o f projects 
financed by the Bank and by other external donors. The fact that Congress i s 
constitutionally required to approve each and every external loan can result in a long 
interval between loan approval by the Board and loan effectiveness. Bank policy requires 
loans to become effective w i th in 1 8 months o f Board approval. 
I n exceptional 
circumstances the Regional Vice President may approve an extension o f the effectiveness 
deadline. The deadline fo r many loans to Paraguay had to be extended beyond 18 months.

77. Experience shows that Paraguay has institutional weaknesses and governance 
constraints which adversely a f f e c t the pace o f project implementation. As a result, closing 
dates frequently have to be extended beyond the time envisaged at appraisal. That, in turn, 
means that follow-up projects are pushed back until l a t e r in the CAS period and may be 
deferred beyond the CAS period altogether. The Secondary Education and Community 
Development projects are cases in point. A longer-than-expected implementation period 
may sometimes be necessary in order for the development objectives to be attained and 
fully secured. That may, however, a lso increase supervision costs. 
AAA 
78 . The program o f A A A envisaged i n the 2003 CAS was delivered i n full with the sole 
exception o f a Poverty Update that was postponed until FY09 (see Attachment 3). In 
addition to the CAS program, other major ana ly t ic work was also undertaken. Reference 
has already been made t o an Integrated Fiduciary Assessment which has become the single 
most important vehicle for advancing the Bank’s policy dialogue with the Ministry o f 
Finance. The Bank also prepared Policy Notes for the incoming administration o f 2008. 
The Policy Notes review policy options in many sectors, including sectors where the Bank 
already has an operational presence or where i t may develop an operational presence in the 
future. 
79. An assessment o f the Paraguay program o f A A A was undertaken by a QAG panel 
which concluded that the program was highly satisfactory in terms o f its strategic relevance 
to the issues confronting Paraguay. The A A A was a lso rated highly satisfactory in t e r m s o f 
the coherence and the integrated nature o f the program. The internal quality o f the work 
was also found to be fully satisfactory. 
80. However, local participation, consultation and dissemination were identified as areas 
in which the A A A program f e l l short o f i t s otherwise high standards. The QAG report 
made i t clear that the moderately unsatisfactory rating for these aspects o f the program 
reflected, to a large extent, the reluctance o f the authorities to engage proactively with other 
stakeholders. Nevertheless, and irrespective o f the cause, unsatisfactory participation, 
consultation and dissemination i s a shortcoming that can seriously detract from the overall 
effectiveness o f the A A A program. Accordingly, the Bank has taken steps to strengthen 
this aspect o f A A A i n Paraguay. 
81. Since the QAG panel made i t s assessment, the Bank has undertaken additional 
analytic work with a heightened emphasis on client participation, consultation and 
dissemination. I n that respect, the Integrated Fiduciary Assessment (IFA) already referred 
to i n paragraph 3 5 above was o f particular importance. From its very inception the IFA 
could count upon the support and participation o f senior s t a f f from the Ministry o f Finance 
including the Vice Minister o f Administration and Finance and the Director o f Budget. 
Workshops were held to agree upon a calendar o f activities and upon the areas o f 
responsibility for the Government and for the Bank-IDB team respectively. A follow-up 
action plan to the IFA has a lso been agreed on a participatory basis. I n the absence o f 
lending, the IFA has become a key instrument fo r pursuing a dialogue with the Ministry o f 
Finance on policy and structural reforms.

Program Costs 

82. The cos t o f A A A in Paraguay i s i n line with other comparator countries in Latin 
America and elsewhere although the spread between them i s not very great. Paraguay a lso 
compares favorably with respect to supervision costs. 
I n terms o f project preparation, 
however, Paraguay appears to be relatively high cost and i t s unfavorable ranking i s made 
more significant by the relatively high spread between comparator countries. This may 
reflect preparatory work done on projects that are dropped from the program before Board 
presentation. On the other hand, preparatory work done on projects that do not move 
forward i s not necessarily lost. I t may very well contribute directly and indirectly to the 
achievement o f the overall objectives o f the CAS. 
Co l labo ra t ion w i th other donors 
83 . The Government does not have an established framework for coordinating donor 
assistance. Nevertheless, the Bank endeavors to coordinate its operational and analytic 
work with other donors on an ad hoc basis as appropriate. I n some cases there are Bank- 
wide agreements with other agencies for working together on A A A o f common interest. 
Reference has, already been made to an Integrated Fiduciary Assessment (IFA) which was 
undertaken within the framework o f the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability 
program (PEFA). The fac t that PEFA i s an international partnership between the World 
Bank, the European Community, the UK’s Department for International Development, the 
Swiss S ta te Secretariat fo r Economic Affairs, the French Ministry o f Foreign Affairs, the 
Royal Norwegian Ministry o f Foreign Affairs, the IM F and the Strategic Partnership with 
Africa undoubtedly engaged the interest o f the Paraguayan authorities and motivated them 
to cooperated proactively in the IFA . Other analytic work done jointly with other donors 
include a 2006 Financial Sector Assessment based on the joint IMF-World Bank FSAP and 
a Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) prepared jointly with the IDB .

84 . Where warranted, the Bank has a lso cooperated on occasions with other agencies in 
specific project work. A Community Development P ro jec t has defined a common strategy 
with two complementary grants from the Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF) targeted 
a t indigenous areas in Eastern Paraguay. Similarly, a Sustainable Agriculture and Rural 
Development Project has a lso coordinated with the JSDF and with other donors that are 
active in rural development including KfW, IFAD and the IDB . There i s liason with the 
IDB in many projects financed by the Bank.

The Bank has effectively re-engaged with Paraguay and re-engagement has produced 
positive results in assisting Paraguay make progress with its reform agenda. 
Lesson: The Bank should continue with a policy o f engagement i n Paraguay. 
86. The effective delivery o f the Bank’s assistance program i s affected by the 
uncertainties that prevail in terms o f Government policy priorities and legislative prospects. 
I t i s a lso subject to higher transaction costs because o f institutional weakneses and a fragile 
fiduciary environment. 
Lesson: The Bank should seek to expand i t s operational program i n Paraguay 
gradually to mitigate potential risks. 
The successful implementation o f an expanded lending program would require 
strong support from the Bank. 
Lesson: S t a f f and budget resources devoted t o the Paraguay program, including the 
resident mission in Asunci6n need to be strengthened in order to manage the risks 
posed by a fragile institutional, fiduciary and governance environment. 
I s s u e s o f governance i n Paraguay are complex, particularly as they concern the 
relationship between the executive, the legislature, the judiciary and c iv i l society. 
Experience shows that the CAS program may encounter difficulties as a result o f these 
complexities if they are not fu l ly understood or resolved. 
Lesson: The Bank should consult widely with multiple stakeholders, including c i v i l 
society to ensure that there i s a broad consensus with the objectives o f the CAS and 
the instruments for attaining those objectives. 
8 9 . Experience in Paraguay shows that CAS objectives can be successfully attained with 
a variety o f instruments including lending, technical assistance, the use o f grant finance and 
AAA . I f one o f these approaches (such as lending) encounters obstacles, other instruments 
can be mobilized to advance the CAS objectives. 
Lesson: The Bank should adopt a flexible approach in designing and implementing 
the country assistance strategy to Paraguay. I t should be s e l e c t i v e in matching 
instruments to changing policy priorities and political circumstances. 
90 . Technical assistance can play an important role i n enabling Paraguay to move 
forwards with a program o f structural and policy reform. However, experience shows that 
there i s resistance to financing technical assistance with external loans. 
Lesson: The Bank should seek to finance technical assistance by mobilizing grant 
funds wherever possible.

I n a small country such as Paraguay, a sustained commitment in sectors such as 
transport and water supply has allowed the Bank good access to key decision makers and 
has thereby enhanced the effectiveness o f economic and sector work. 
Lesson: The Bank should continue to expand and sustain an active operational 
presence in key sectors. 
Experience shows that there are significant risks associated with implementing a CAS 
program in Paraguay. 
Lesson: The CAS should be designed t o mitigate risk by undertaking fiduciary 
assessments and by employing instruments such as programmatic adjustment lending 
or adaptable program lending that can facilitate risk management where the sector 
policy framework i s incomplete.

CPS Preparation Process 

The CPS was prepared on the basis o f an extensive consu l ta t ions process i n i t i a l l y (du r ing 
the t h i r d quarter o f 2008) focused o n strategic p o l i c y d i rec t ion at the coun t ry o r sectoral 
f o l l ow e d b y consultations o n the proposed CPS i t s e l f . Key re su l t s o f the 
level, 
consultations processes inc lude : 

The i n i t i a l c l ien t survey o f fe red impo r tan t ins igh ts o n the pe rcep t ion (pos i t ive and 
negative) that k e y stakeholders had about the work o f the W o r l d B a n k in 
Paraguay. I t also ind ica ted a number o f b road areas where the B a n k c o u l d serve 
as a development partner f o r Paraguay. 

During the P o l i c y N o t e s discussions in June 2008, the elected Government 
expressed strong i n t e r e s t in working with the W o r l d B a n k in areas such as: land 
access and ru ra l pove r ty , the mode rn iza t ion o f the p u b l i c adm in is t ra t ion and the 
management o f state owned en te rp r ises , regu la t ion , in f ras t ruc tu re (transport, 
water, and e lec t r ic i ty ) , as well as safety ne t s and education. F o l l ow - u p meetings, 
i n c l u d i n g a de ta i led discussion o n the CPS with the enlarged economic cabinet in 
February 2009 , he lped t o better define areas o f B a n k support as well as the 
instruments t o be used (e.g., ex is t ing p o r t f o l i o , new lending, and non - lend ing 
technical assistance). Consu l ta t ion with the in te rna t iona l c omm u n i t y o n the d ra f t 
CPS helped the B a n k to better define some o f the i s s u e s and understand po ten t ia l 
synergies with mu l t i la te ra l and b i la te ra l programs. 

Discussions with C i v i l Society p rov ided ideas f o r enhancing a number o f the 
proposed ac t iv i t ies . For instance, the focus o f a proposed Educa t ion ope ra t ion was 
sharpened to inc lude a process t o review the needs f o r re fo rms in h ighe r 
education, while s ta r t ing with a small p rog ram o f scholarships abroad. A lso , C i v i l 
Society pa r t ic ipan ts proposed that the dialogue o n safety nets, w h i c h might lead 
t o p ro jec t p repa ra t ion when the authorities consider i t appropriate, be enhanced 
with a discussion o n the type o f t ra in ing and re t ra in ing needs t o enhance labo r 
m o b i l i t y , pa r t icu la r ly during the current econom ic s lowdown . C i v i l Society also 
encouraged the Bank t o c l a r i f y the ways in which i t can assist the authorities in 
inc reas ing their pa r t ic ipa t ion in the p u b l i c investment p r o g r a m - e s p e c i a l l y in 
those programs that are co - f inanced by the W o r l d Bank-and 
the B a n k agreed to 
prepare a qu ick response note f o r c i v i l society o n this matter. 

A. Strategic Dialogue: 

Strategic discussions o n p o l i c y d i rec t ion took place with the new Gove rnmen t p r i o r t o 
i t s c om i n g t o o f f ice . In pa r t icu la r , the n ew l y e lec ted President, Fernando Lugo, 
chaired a one day seminar in Asunc ion in June 2008 to d i s c u s s the findings o f 
fourteen Policy Notes prepared by the B a n k o n top ics rang ing f r o m f isca l 
management and the wage bill, t o social inc lus ion and in f ras t ruc tu re . The seminar, 
and b i la te ra l discussions between B a n k and the elected gove rnmen t team organized 

Annex 3 
Page 2 o f 4 

the day before, generated a close dialogue on key aspects o f the new Government’s 
program and in de f in ing the framework for future Bank support. 

To continue w i t h i t s strategic engagement, the Bank, j o i n t l y w i t h other donors, 
assisted the Government in organizing a high-level seminar on governance and 
development. The seminar, w i t h key note speaker inc lud ing Ricardo Lagos (former 
President o f Chile), included participants such as the vice President o f the Oriental 
Republic o f Uruguay and Directors o f the W o r l d Bank and the Inter-American 
Development Bank, and addressed a large audience, comprising, inter alia, the media, 
academia, po l i t ica l figures and private sector representatives. At the strategic level, 
the seminar provided the elected authorities and key stakeholders w i t h a too l to 
openly engage on country priorities and direction, and to d iscuss the role o f social and 
infrastructure policies. 

A Client Survey was completed in August 2008 to better understand the overall 
situation in Paraguay and how the Bank i s perceived b y i t s main interlocutors, and 
other key stakeholders. The Survey provided very useful in fo rma t ion and was a 
valuable guide to the Bank as i t seeks to move forward in increasing i t s support to 
Paraguay. A summary o f survey’s objectives, methodology and main f ind ing i s 
provided be low (see B o x 1 below). 

Box 1 : 2008 C l ient Survey - Aligning Wo r ld Bank’s Priorities in Paraguay 
Objectives: A client survey was conducted i n August 2008 to ass is t in understanding how stakeholders in 
Paraguay perceive the Bank and better inform the preparation o f the CPS. 
Methodology: Ma i l- in quantitative surveys were sent to 453 potential participants in June 2008. Potential 
participants were drawn, among others, from the office o f the President, Prime Minister, Minister or State 
Secretary, federal government staff, Parliamentarian members or staff, bilateral or multilateral agencies, 
private sector, NGOs, academia, the media, professional associations and the judiciary. The response rate 
was fairly low at 34%. As 93% o f respondents were from Asuncion, comparisons among geographic 
locations were not possible. The process was managed on the ground by a l o c a l professional services 
company. 
Ove ra l l Findings: Governance i s identified, overwhelmingly, as key development priority in Paraguay. 
The Bank’s focus on governance i s therefore validated by survey findings. However, education emerges as 
key contributor to poverty reduction and faster growth.. Therefore, stakeholders would like to see the Bank 
play a significant role in education, an area where the Bank has been successfully involved in the past. 
Stakeholders recognized the value o f Bank involvement in other critical area such as infrastructure, 
governance and poverty. Going forward, Paraguay wants the bank to focus on tangibles - Le. access to 
education and basic infrastructure - to reduce poverty. 
Perceptions o f the Bank: Overall perception o f the Bank and its efforts to collaborate and include 
stakeholders i s very positive. There i s a c a l l for greater Bank involvement in Paraguay. However, NGO 
respondents have a negative perception o f the Bank on certain issues (albeit number o f respondents in this 
category was very low), which i s often picked up by the press in articles against the Bank in general or 
specific government interventions supported by the Bank in the past. 
Perceived weaknesses: No t enough i s being done to prevent corruption in Bank projects. The Bank i s 
technocratic i n light o f political realities, and its flexibility i s a concern. Finally, the Banks’ ability to adapt 
knowledge i s somewhat low. 
Fam i l ia r i ty w ith the Bank: Familiarity with the Bank i s low among certain groups o f stakeholders 
(NGOs, media). This might explain the respondent NGO’s negative perceptions o f the Bank on certain 
issues. There i s a need to increase Bank awareness among stakeholders, as higher familiarity i s correlated 
with more positive views o f the Bank.

B. Consultations on the Proposed CPS: 

Consultations with the international community and with civil society were carried out 
b y the Bank, in partnership w i t h the Government o f Paraguay, in December 2008 in 
Asuncion and in February 2009 in Asuncion and Coronel Oviedo (the third or fourth 
largest c i ty in the country, and a p lace where i t i s easy to inv i te participants from a vast 
ru ra l part o f the Eastern side o f the country). 

Consultations w i t h the donor community were very positive. The representatives o f 
the international community were supportive o f the Bank’s approach as outlined in 
the CPS and expressed appreciation fo r the Bank’s transparency and fo r i t s openness 
in collaborating w i t h them. In particular, the European Union, Spain, Germany and 
Uruguay concurred w i t h the Bank on the need to support the state modernization 
agenda through a se r ies o f development po l icy lending operations (DPLs). Some 
donors questioned whether governance should be given as much prominence in the 
CPS, but i t was agreed that the CPS’s focus on governance i s appropriate given that 
the Government’s program i t s e l f i s heavily centered on this issue . The question o f 
whether the CPS was excessively loaded w i t h non-lending T A was raised, but most, 
inc lud ing the representative o f the IDB, welcomed the proposed technical focus and 
praised the important ro le that the W o r l d Bank has been p lay ing as a leading source 
o f knowledge fo r both the Government and the en t i re donor community in Paraguay. 

0 The ma in message emerging f rom consultations w i t h c i v i l society in both Asuncion 
and Coronel Oviedo i s a c a l l for the Bank to help incorporate c i v i l society’s views 
and participation in the Government’s public investment program, particularly those 
programs w i t h f inanc ia l support f rom the Bank. I t was explained that the 
Government’s program supported b y the Wo r ld Bank has invo lved c i v i l society in 
various ways (e.g., directly, as in the Community Development Project, and l e s s 
directly, as in the Road Maintenance Project), and i t was evident that the mechanisms 
o f engagement promoted b y the Bank were not clear to c i v i l society representatives. 
In this regard, i t was proposed that the Bank commission a po l icy note to address this 
i s s u e in FY10. This wou ld s e r v e the purpose o f both explaining the type o f 
government-civil society partnerships that were forged in the past, and opening a 
dialogue on new way in wh ich this collaboration can take place in the future. 
Members o f c i v i l society also noted the need for the Bank to f a c i l i t a t e the consensus 
bu i ld ing dialogue over public po l icy priorities, such as, for example, on the e f f e c t s o f 
the global financial c r i s i s in Paraguay and on the appropriate response to the c r i s i s . . 
I t was suggested this could take place in the context o f the Bank’s proposed dialogue 
on growth. 

Members o f the central or l o c a l Government, who attended the consultations, 
facilitated significantly the dialogue and helped the Bank explain to the various 
aud iences h ow i t operates in order to support a country’s development agenda. In 
particular, we wou ld l i k e to thank:

Governance and Anticorruption in Paraguay 

Context 
1. 

Paraguay presents serious challenges in the areas o f governance and control of 
corruption. The recent Presidential elections had a strong focus on the need to improve 
governance and b r ing about significant change in what i s perceived as a critical 
handicap for mov ing in to a more advance phase o f development. The Lug0 
Administration obtained a strong mandate f rom the electorate to improve governance 
conditions in the country and has shown a strong commitment and determination to 
take serious steps in that direction. 

2. 

The root o f the problem can be traced back to Paraguay's history and po l i t ica l 
economy. Under a dictatorship during most o f the second half o f the 20th Century, 
Paraguay started in the early nineties a timid transition to democracy under the same 
party -the Colorado Party - that had been the cornerstone o f the dictatorship and had a 
firm g r ip over a l l state activities. Since the n ine t ies , the re has been a steady progress 
toward po l i t i ca l competition and democratic processes. However, there has been 
limited progress in removing the pervasive cu l tu re o f patronage, clientelism and 
po l i t ica l control in the management o f Government that continues to be the legacy o f 
the Stroessner's dictatorship. One dimension o f this culture i s the exorbitant powers 
provided to Congress over the selection and salary scales o f c i v i l servants. As a result, 
Paraguay's c i v i l s e r v i c e i s amongst the weakest and most po l i t ic ized in L a t i n America, 
despite the fact that Paraguay's expenditure on public sector sa la r ies i s we l l above the 
regional average (Figure 1). A n independent diagnostic o f the key manifestations of 
corruption i s presented in B o x 1 below. 

I 

Box 1: Governance Assessments 

According to a recent assessment', the perception o f corruption i s high for a l l powers o f government, 
including the state-owned enterprises and the two hydro power plants jo in t ly owned by Paraguay with the 
governments o f Brazil and Argentina, respectively. The lack o f transparency and controls over social 
spending in Paraguay by the Itaipu binational enterprise particularly noteworthy. Corruption affects 
multiple aspects o f daily l i f e o f a Paraguayan citizen, including transit policy " f e e s " and "payments made to 
ease the handling o f key processes by a highly complicated bureaucracy. According to this report, large 
corruption i s associated mainly with campaign finance, and government's contracts or concessions. 
Although cronyism, patronage, and traffic o f influences are present and frequently visible in day to day l i f e , 
i t i s the corruption associated with illegal activities on a large scale, such as contraband, money laundering, 
and drugs, which influences the politics and economy o f the country the most, even though i t i s l e s s visible. 
Complementing these results are the findings o f a 2005 comprehensive survey to diagnose the incidence o f 
corruption conducted by a public/private Council established i n 2005 to promote integrity (namely the 
"Consejo impulsor del Sistema Nacional de Integridad-CISNI"), which signals that the political parties 
are perceived as the most corrupt institutions i n the country. Others institutions perceived as fostering 
corruption include the Customs Administration, the Supreme Court, the General Prosecutor's o f f ice , and 
congress2.

Ove r the past t e n years, Paraguay has made some progress in selected areas o f 
governance. The B a n k th rough WB I p layed an impo r tan t r o l e in h e l p i n g the coun t ry

some tang ib le progress in the areas o f p u b l i c p rocu remen t and customs. D e s p i t e this 
progress, ove ra l l achievements rema in l im i t e d and p u b l i c distrust in the state and i t s 
ins t i tu t ions 
i s deeply rooted. 
Paraguay has, howeve r , shown some re la t ive 
imp rovemen t in the drive and strength o f i t s c i v i l society, and has exh ib i ted an increase 
in social and p o l i t i c a l openness and an imp rovemen t in p o l i t i c a l s tab i l i ty as the p o l i t i c a l

During the last Adm in is t ra t ion , the re was a s ign i f ican t e f fo r t t o im p r o v e

short term f inanc ia l v i a b i l i t y was at stake. Im p r o v i n g tax co l lec t ion and strengthening 
the revenue base became a c r i t i c a l p r i o r i t y . The Dua r te A dm i n i s t r a t i o n achieved an 
impo r tan t success in this area, as evidenced b y an average budget s u r p l u s o f 1% o f 
G D P since 2004. This e f fo r t has been comp lemen ted by impo r tan t in i t ia t ives a imed at

1. Paraguay's long-run growth performance has been disappointing. GDP per capita grew 

Per capita income, in '000 of constant 2002 US$ 

b y 1 ?4 percent on average s ince 1960 , but over the past 25 years, GDP per capita declined b y 
'/z percent on average per year. The 
improvement in the 1970s was largely 
related to the construction o f the Itaipu 
hydropower 
plant, w i t h 
important 
spillovers to the economy, and to the 
development o f agriculture in the eastern 
part o f the country. Higher growth in the 
1970s contributed to bridge the gap w i t h 
other L a t i n American countries, but then 
the gap stagnated in the 1980s. Paraguay

2 * The recent growth 
between 2004 and 2008, the largest 
expansion s ince the 1970s, was welcomed, but i t highlighted a number o f weaknesses o f the 

economic ~ t r u c t u r e . ~ A t the aggregate level, as demand accelerated over the past years, the 
economy started to show signs o f overheating. Analyses prepared b y the IMF suggest that 
current growth may be higher than its potential. Equally important, wh i le some diversification 
occurred (the demise o f cotton production was met w i t h a major supply response b y country 
producers to opportunities that arose in the wo r ld market for soy bean and bee f ; also, new 
products such as stevia, sesame seeds and sugar cane, are now important source o f income fo r 
small and medium farmers). The challenge o f a growth strategy is , thus, to find a mixture o f 
policies that w i l l l i f t sustainable growth upwards over the long run, wh i le at the same time help 
diversifying in terms o f bo th products and markets. 

G row th Accounting and Determinants4 

3 . The growth accounting methodology allows analyzing the contribution o f factor 
accumulation and productivity to growth. Table 1 summarizes the findings o f a g row th 

breakdown made b y Loayza et. al. (2005) for the period 1960-2000 and extends their re su l t s fo r 
2000-2006. In the first breakdown, TFP i s constructed as the residual o f the contribution o f labor 
force and o f capital. In the second breakdown, labor i s adjusted b y increases in education 

' Prepared by Pedro L. Rodriguez, Country Manager, LCC7 
' The trend i s similar if GDP per capita i s measured i n purchasing power parity or at market exchange rates. 
For example, as construction demand accelerated i n 2006, the state-owned cement company, which enjoys a monopoly given 
the recent ban imposed on clinker imports, collapsed due to lack o f maintenance and continued po l i t ica l interference on the 
company's operations. This situation paralyzed the construction sector-which 
i s a key channel o f transmission from the export 
boom into employment generation. 
This section relies heavily on the comprehensive analysis o f growth accounting and growth determinants in La t in America and 
the Caribbean developed by Loayza, Fajnzylber, and Calderon (2005). I t extends their results for the most recent period not 
covered i n their paper.

accomplishments. F ina l ly , in the third breakdown, b o t h labo r and cap i ta l are adjusted f o r their 
l e v e l o f u t i l iza t ion , p r o x i e d b y the emp loymen t rate. 

4. The contribution o f total factor productivity has been negative during the 1980s, as in 
other Lat in American countries, but, unlike them, i t has not recovered until the early 

2000s. Nega t ive p r o d u c t i v i t y g r ow t h was a c omm o n trend in L a t i n Am e r i c a during the 1980s (1 7 
countries experienced such negative T F P acco rd ing t o Loayza e t . al.), but mos t countries showed 
pos i t ive TFP con t r ibu t ion du r ing the 1990s. Paraguay i s one o f the few countries in the r e g i o n 
that was unable to recover f r om the f a l l in i t s p r o d u c t i v i t y g r ow t h o f the 1980s. The con t inued 
negative TFP g r ow t h in the 1990s m a y re f lec t the p o l i t i c a l unce r ta in ty in this pe r iod w h i c h has 
reduced the incentives t o invest in Paraguay, as suggested by Fernandez and M o n j e (2004). B y 
contrast, Paraguay experienced pos i t ive TFP g r ow t h since 2000, and a l l the mo re so since 2003. 
As i s shown in the nex t section, this i s related to better terms o f trade, but also t o imp rovemen ts 
in the macroeconomic s i tua t ion and t o the imp lemen ta t ion o f s t ruc tu ra l re fo rms .

5 . Another methodology to assess growth performance consists 
in studying the 
determinants of growth, such as structural and stabilization policies and cyclical factors. 

Loayza e t a l . (2005) have estimated the impac t o f such factors over 1976-2000 f o r a pane l o f 
L a t i n Am e r i c a countries. Tab le 3 presents the coe f f ic ien ts o f these models, as w e l l as the r e s u l t s 
for Paraguay and extends the analysis t o the mos t recent pe r iod . A c c o r d i n g t o the model, the 
decline o f per capita G D P g r ow t h in the early 1980s i s exp la ined m a i n l y as a co r rec t ion after the 
ove rhea t ing o f the la te 1970s, comb ined with g r ow i n g economic ins tab i l i t y and a negative terms- 
of-trade shock. The economy recovered somewhat in the late 1980s, in pa r t because o f im p r o v e d 
t e r m s o f trade, higher trade openness, and a favo rab le exchange rate. The con t inued de te r io ra t ion 
o f economic g r ow t h during the 1990s was caused m a i n l y by the succession o f b a n k i n g crises that 
affected Paraguay f r o m 1996 until 2002. Since 2000, economic g r ow t h recovered, f o l l o w i n g a 
c y c l i c a l upturn after the bank ing crises, but also because o f im p r o v e d t e r m s o f trade and 
structural re fo rms .

6. Economic instability has been one o f the main factors explaining the poor performance 

o f Paraguay until recently. The lack o f macroeconomic stability became a significant constraint 
on the overall performance o f the economy during the 1990s pe r iod and contributed negatively to 
growth for the entire period o f analysis-Trade 
shocks over the 1995-2003 period, and financial 
sector instability between 1998 and 2003 explain instability during these years. Thus, 
maintaining the achieved macroeconomic stability, and reducing overall macroeconomic 
volatility, w i l l continue to be an important component o f the growth agenda for Paraguay.

7 . By contrast, structural reforms have generally been supportive even during bad times. 

The contribution o f s t ruc tu ra l reforms has been positive although their contribution to growth f e l l 
during the second half o f the 1990s. Over the entire period o f analysis, the contribution o f 
structural policies has generally been higher than in other La t in American countries, reflecting 
mostly Paraguay's increased trade openness, improved education, and financial deepening. 
Strengthening po l icy efforts in a l l these areas should also remain h i g h on the g row th agenda.

used to fos te r it, t h e r e a r e a n u m b e r o f sec to ra l po l ic ies that a r e i m p o r t a n t in a n y case. 
These include f ive important areas: 

Transport. The h igh costs o f transport and logistics, together with access to finance, are the 
major obstacles to private sector development, especially fo r export industries. The share o f 
costs associated w i t h transport i s b y far the largest among the logistical costs faced b y 
private sector en te rp r ises . The main causes fo r h i g h transport costs include factors such as 
the poor condition o f the road network, lack o f coordination among operators and use rs of 
f luv ia l ports, and a lack o f dredging and signaling along the f luv ia l transport system. The 
inefficiency o f the customs system further contributes to increasing costs. Currently on ly 
14% o f the total road network i s in good condition, wh ich largely corresponds to the total 
proportion o f the network wh ich i s paved. Wh i le 50% o f imports and 47% o f exports 
(2006) are transported b y river, the lack o f s u f f i c i e n t dredging and signaling along major 
waterways (particular the R io Paraguay) imposes additional transport costs estimated at 
U S $ l 5 0 m i l l iodyea r , s ince barges cannot be fully loaded and - in many areas - can on ly 
operate during daylight. Finally, a i r transport i s also plagued b y institutional weaknesses in 
sector planning and airport operations as we l l as underinvestment in airport infrastructure 
which limit airfreight volumes and passenger t ra f f ic . In v iew o f the current constraints and 
the importance o f the transport sector to private sector development, i t w i l l be necessary to 
strengthen management o f the road network, and to p r io r i t ize the allocation o f scarce 
resources to rural roads and to the overall network maintenance. In the medium-term, 
important steps may include an improvement in the systems used for road network 
planning, as w e l l as a modernization o f the t o l l system, and improved budgetary execution. 
In terms o f f luv ia l transport, there i s a urgent need to improve dredging and signaling as 
we l l as customs processing. Air transport cou ld benefit, among others things, f rom 
integrated multi-modal sector planning, and a separation o f the roles o f sector planning, 
regulation and airport operations under e f f i c i e n t operators.

Telecommunications. Paraguay 
to 
face bottlenecks 
fixed-line 
telecommunications services due largely to underinvestment and i n e f f i c i e n c i e s in the 
public telecoms monopoly (COPACO) that undermine growth opportunities in information 
technologies and ca l l cen ters as we l l as the use o f the internet for e-government and in 
schools. A t only 0.9%, the depth o f broadband penetration lags significantly behind 
MERCOSUR partners such as B raz i l (4%), Argentina (6.6%) and Chile ( 8 . 8% ) 5 . 
COPACO’s monopoly on fiber optic cable access has led to internet access charges that are 
approximately 10 t im e s higher than those in the U S or 12 t imes higher than those in 
Korea6. Wh i le COPACO charges about US$0 ,4 l /m inu te fo r calls to the US and Canada 
and about US$0,66/minute for calls to Europe, average p r ices f rom L a t i n American 
coun t r ies that have liberalized i n t e r n e t access7 run about US$0.03 and US$O.OS 
respectively. 

‘ Charges for 1 Mb/s service from COPACO under a 1 year contract run about US$600/month. while 1.44 Mb/s services (without

Korea Telecom cost about US$SO/month.

0 The Electricity Sector. Wh i le Paraguay i s blessed with abundant hydropower generation 
capacity (primarily f rom the I ta ipu and Yacyreta dams), key weaknesses in transmission 
and distribution hamper the development o f productive activities in both rural and urban 
areas, as w e l l as the prospects for true formal exports. Wh i le electricity coverage reaches 
93.8% o f a l l households (‘just be low the L A C average o f 94.6%), average per capita 
consumption per year was only 853 kWh , far lowe r than in Ch i le (2.745 kwh lcap i tdyea r ) 
or in B raz i l (2.166 kwhlcapitalyear). Moreover, system losses (31.1% overall - - 8.1% in 
transmission and 23% in distribution) are very h i g h and w e l l above the 13.5% weighted 
average for the L A C region. 

0 Agriculture and Na tu ra l Resources. The agriculture sector i s the mainstay o f Paraguay’s 
economy, representing approximately 21% o f GDP and 5 5% o f exports. I t also employs 
about 32% o f the national labor force. Du r ing 1991-2005 the agriculture sector’s share o f 
GDP grew at a rate o f 3.7% annually and experienced a shift in production, away from 
cotton and increasingly concentrated in soy and beef, which together rep resen t about 90% 
o f total exports. A l though overall productivity in the sector has increased, that o f small 
fa rme rs has deteriorated, thus contributing to an increase in extreme poverty in the rural 
areas. The uneven distribution o f agricultural land, a h igh concentration o f both production 
and exports in a few products, and the lack o f o f f - fa rm employment and processing o f 
agricultural crops in ru ra l areas, are among the most pressing challenges. Paraguay’s land 
ownership G IN1 c o e f f i c i e n t i s the highest in the wo r ld . The sector i s also faced w i t h limited 
access to neighboring markets. Important priorities in a re fo rm agenda fo r the short t e r m 
include (i) development o f a coherent national po l icy fo r land administration and land 
access combined w i t h financing to promote land acquisition and productive investments b y 
small (or landless) farmers: (ii) efficient agricultural extension services specifically 
targeted to small farmers ideally through cooperation w i t h agricultural en te rp r ises and 
cooperatives wh ich could transfer know-how; and (iii) the creation o f rural off-farm 
employment. In the medium-term, i t w i l l be important to develop a strategy o f agricultural 
diversification and to attract additional investment to rural areas in order to encourage local 
processing o f agricultural products. Perhaps the single greatest weakness in t e r m s of natural 
resource management in Paraguay l i e s in the forestry sector. Paraguay has lost at least 80 
percent o f i t s forests over the last 50 years and losses o f 500 h d d a y occurred between 1966 
and 1991. O f the remaining 2 m i l l i o n ha in the Upper Parana Atlantic Forest (UPAF, i .e . 
forests east o f the Paraguay River), only an estimated 800,000 are s t i l l considered 
productive. This i s due to destructive logging practices that have degraded the forests, and 
a r e s u l t o f deforestation that has fragmented much o f the U P A F in to unmanageably small 
remnant patches. Wh i le deforestation appears to have slowed recently in the east - - due 
both to resource depletion and some success w i t h a “Zero Deforestation” law - - i t seems to 
have n ow moved west in to the Arid Chaco, wh ich i s home to 78 percent o f Paraguay’s 
remaining native forests. 

Business Climate: Paraguay’s overall ranking dropped f rom 108 in the 2008 report to 115, 
wh ich i s be low the average fo r L A C and fo r low -m idd le income countries (see Table 1). 
The change r e f l e c t s stronger downward s h i f t s in four areas: “starting a business”, 
“registering property”, “getting credit” and “trading across borders”. Wh i le Paraguay 

continues t o fare compa ra t ive ly well in the f i r s t three areas, the de te r io ra t ion in the latter 
area puts the coun t ry in the lowes t qua r t i le . Imp rovemen ts in r a n k i n g were achieved in t w o 
areas - “c los ing a bus iness” and en fo rc ing contracts”, but Paraguay continues t o l a g behind 
comparator countries in those areas. Paraguay’s weakest areas are “emp loy ing workers”, 
“ t rad ing across borders”, and “c los ing a business”.
