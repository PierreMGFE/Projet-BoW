EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

1. 

Djibouti is a small country of about 830,000 people, strategically located in 
the Ho rn of Africa at the southern end of 

the Red Sea. The coun t ry i s almost a c i t y - 
state-about 
two - th i rds o f t o w n dwe l le rs l i v e in the cap i ta l c i ty . The hinterland, a n 
extension o f the deser ts o f E t h i o p i a and Somalia, i s sparsely occupied by a poo r pastoral 

and nomad ic popu la t ion . Politically stable, the country plays a neutral role in the 
frequently tense regional politics of the Ho rn of Africa. 

11. 

Djibouti’s economy i s based on rents deriving from its strategic location: port 
revenues, military revenues, and foreign aid. D j i b o u t i i s p o o r l y endowed with na tu ra l 

resources, with limited arable land, ra in fa l l , and water. The manu fac tu r ing sector i s weak 
and ag r icu l tu re non-existent. A s a result, the economy i s based m a i n l y o n revenues and 
r e n t s generated d i rec t ly and ind i rec t ly f r o m the ac t iv i t ies o f the in te rna t iona l P o r t o f 
D j i b o u t i and related businesses, i n c l u d i n g the trade t r a f f i c t rans i t ing t o and f r o m 
land locked Ethiopia, the m a i n use r o f D j i b o u t i po r t s (with a popu la t ion o f about 75 
m i l l i o n people).

111. 

Fo r the last four years-the period of 
the last Country Assistance Strategy 
(CAS)-Djibouti’s economic growth has been strong. Rea l GDP g r ow t h accelerated 

f r o m an annual average o f 3 percent in 2001-2005 t o 4.8 percent in 2006 and 5 .9 percent 
in 2008. T h i s surge in g r ow t h was driven m a i n l y by f isca l expansion and large f o r e i g n 
d i rec t investments (FDI) in the port, tourism, and cons t ruc t ion sectors. G r ow t h was 
accompanied by increased in f la t ion , however, w h i c h reached 14 percent in the 12 -mon th 
pe r iod t o Augus t 2008 as a resu l t o f the g loba l spike in energy and f o o d prices. 

iv. However, Djibouti’s economic growth has not been sufficient to address the 
country’s deep structural poverty and break the cycle of 
low social and economic 

outcomes. Desp i te re la t i ve ly high pe r cap i ta income (US $ 1,060 in 2007), the inc idence 
o f pove r ty i s high in D j i b o u t i (42 percent absolute and 75 percent relative). Pove r ty i s 
exacerbated by the presence o f a large number o f refugees living in D j ibou t i , w h o p lace 
further pressure o n the country’s already strained soc ia l services. Desp i te some progress 
in increasing school en ro l lmen t and reduc ing mo r ta l i ty , outcomes r em a i n compa ra t ive ly 
l o w . A s a food -de f ic i t country, 
t o t a l l y dependent o n impo r ts t o meet i t s f o o d 
requirements, D j i b o u t i i s highly sensitive to external shocks such as surging f o o d and f u e l 
prices and na tu ra l phenomena such as 
f loods and droughts. F ina l ly , high 
u n em p l o ym e n t - e s t im a t e d at 45-60 p e r c e n t - c o n t r i b u t e s t o the f rag i l i t y . 

v. 

Djibouti is not immune to the impact of the globalfinancial and economic crisis. 

A l t h o u g h the risk o f d i rec t c r is is con tag ion i n t o the coun t ry ’s emb ryon ic f inanc ia l sector 
remains low , the g loba l c r is is m a y reach D j i b o u t i m a i n l y th rough the reduc t ion o f f o r e i g n 
d i rec t investment. The impac t o f this r isk , cu r ren t ly considered limited, w i l l depend o n 
h o w deeply D j ibou t i ’s m a j o r economic partners w o u l d be affected and o n D j ibou t i ’s o w n 
p o l i c y response.

vi. 

Djibouti’s new Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper-the 
Na t iona l 
Initiative for Social Development (INDS)-provides 
a comprehensive vision for 
economic growth and poverty reduction. Presented to t h e World Bank’s Execu t ive 
B o a r d on October 17, 2008, the strategy a ims to: (i) accelerate g r ow t h w h i l e ma in ta in ing 
macroeconomic stability; (ii) achieve un ive r sa l access t o basic services and the 
development o f human capital; (iii) p romo te ha rmon ious and balanced l o c a l development 
tha t preserves the environment; and (iv) im p r o v e governance and capacity building. 

v i i . 

The proposed CAS for FY2009-2012 has been prepared in consultation with 
the Government and other stakeholders in an effort 
to increase harmonization and 
complementarity. The objectives, themes, and p rog rams inc luded in the proposed C A S 
were discussed with the Government, c i v i l society, and other donors during fo rma l 
consultations between Novembe r 2008 and February 2009. The feedback p r o v i d e d during 
these consultations has b e e n inco rpo ra ted i n t o the strategy. The C A S places a s t rong 
emphasis on w o r k i n g in concert with donors, focusing Bank programs on the Bank’s 
comparative advantage, avoiding p rog ram dup l ica t ion , and strengthening aid 
ha rmon iza t ion . The C A S also represents an e f f o r t t o strengthen coo rd ina t ion within the 
W o r l d Bank Group, with con t r ibu t ions f r o m the In te rna t iona l Finance Co rpo ra t ion ( IFC ) 
and the M u l t i l a t e r a l Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). 

... v i i i . 

The CAS is highly selective and builds on the achievements of 
the previous 
CAS. As la id ou t in the C A S Comp le t ion Repo r t (Annex 2), so l id pe r fo rmance was 
achieved under the p rev ious CAS : p o r t f o l i o management imp roved d rama t ica l ly , and 
every p ro jec t i s expected t o mee t i t s development objectives. In the areas o f governance 
and competitiveness, however-two 
areas where the Gove rnmen t h a d n o t ye t made a 
strong comm i tmen t to reform-not 
a l l outcomes were achieved. Based o n the Bank ’s 
p rev ious experience in Djibouti, the l i m i t e d IDA resource envelope, and the lessons 
learned about development effectiveness in sma l l states, the proposed C A S fo r FY 2 0 0 9 - 
2012 targets a sma l l numbe r o f activities. The selection o f lending p rog rams has focused 
o n areas where the Bank has a strong performance record. The Bank w i l l also p r o v i d e 
capacity building assistance in other sectors where i t has expertise. 

ix . 

The CAS is framed around three strategic themes aligned with the INDS. 
0 Supporting growth. The Bank w i l l support the Government’s e f fo r ts t o 
strengthen the business environment, with a focus on reducing constraints and 
costs 
t o p r iva te 
sector development, 
especially 
the powe r , 
telecommunications, and f inanc ia l sectors. 
Supporting human development and access to basic services. The Bank 
w i l l h e l p D j i b o u t i increase access t o and qua l i ty o f education and hea l th 
services, and strengthen social p ro tec t ion and d i rec t support t o p o o r people. 
Supporting governance and public sector management. T h e Bank w i l l 
continue to engage in p o l i c y d ia logue and techn ica l assistance t o strengthen 
the budget process and imp rove m o n i t o r i n g and evaluation.

The proposed assistance strategy recognizes tha t there a re nonetheless risks 
the CAS or l im i t its impact. G r o w t h and sustained 
that could derail implementation of 

macroeconomic s tab i l i ty depend o n the steady f l o w o f Gove rnmen t revenues f r o m the 
p o r t and m i l i t a r y bases and, m o r e c r i t ica l ly , o n the f l o w o f FDI and dono r f inanc ing . 
W h i l e revenues f r o m rented military bases are l i k e l y t o r em a i n and m a y p a r t i a l l y m i t iga te 
the risk o f revenue loss, p o r t revenues and FDI are vu lne rab le t o ex te rna l economic and 
p o l i t i c a l shocks, i n c l u d i n g the persistence o f the current g loba l f inanc ia l crisis. R i s k s 
related t o imp lemen ta t ion capacity also ex is t , but experience f r o m the p rev ious CAS 
shows that we l l - focused p ro jec ts with simple design and close and p roac t ive supervision, 
together with add i t iona l capacity building assistance, can s ign i f ican t ly m i n im i z e this risk.

INTRODUCTION 

1. 
The last Country Assistance StrategV (CAS) for D j ibou t i was discussed by the 
World Bank’s Executive Boa rd in M a r c h 2005. The CAS f o r 2005-2008 supported 

imp lemen ta t ion o f the country’s f i rs t Pove r ty Reduc t ion Strategy Paper (PRSP) with a 
focus o n growth, human development, and governance. 

2 . 
The CAS for FY2009-2012 is based on Djibouti’s Na t iona l In i t ia t ive for 
Social Development (Initiative Na t iona le pou r le Dkveloppement Social - INDS). T h e 

CAS w i l l build o n the founda t ion l a i d in the p rev ious strategy and support con t inued 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the INDS agenda. The three guiding p r inc ip les f o r B a n k engagement 
ove r th is t im e p e r i o d inc lude : (i) a l ignmen t with the INDS; (ii) se lec t iv i ty f o r o p t im a l 
impact; and (iii) comp lemen ta r i ty and ha rmon iza t ion with other donors.

COUNTRY CONTEXT 

A. Political and Soc ia l Context 

3 . 
D j ibou t i is a small, resource-poor country of 23,200 square kilometers, 
strategically located in the H o r n of Africa at the southern end of the Red Sea. D j i b o u t i 

i s p o o r l y endowed with na tu ra l resources, l a c k i n g arable land, su f f ic ien t r a i n f a l l and 
unde rg round water, and o i l o r na tu ra l gas resources. The na t iona l popu la t ion i s estimated 
at 830,000, o f w h i c h 87 percent l i v e in urban areas.’ D j i b o u t i i s essentially a city-state- 
about two - th i rds o f t o w n dwe l le rs live in the cap i ta l c i ty . The hinterland, an extension o f 
the deserts o f E t h i o p i a and Somalia, i s sparsely occupied by a p o o r pastoral and nomad ic 
popu la t ion . D j ibou t i ’s popu la t ion i s young, with about 40 percent under age 15 and o n l y 
15 percent over age 40. 

The country plays a neutral role in the frequently tense regionalpolitics of the 

4. 
H o r n of Africa. D j i b o u t i has become E th iop ia ’s sole link t o the sea since fighting b r o k e 
ou t between E t h i o p i a and E r i t rea in 1998. D j i b o u t i h a d also ma in ta ined a co rd ia l 
re la t ionsh ip with E r i t rea until a border dispute emerged in May -June 2008 . The t w o 
countries have n o t yet engaged in d i rec t negotiations, but the s i tua t ion i s stable. D j i b o u t i 
p lays an active r o l e in hos t ing peace meetings be tween the parties t o the v i o l e n t c o n f l i c t 
in Somalia, and t h e coun t ry continues t o accommodate a la rge number o f refugees f r o m 
ne ighbo r ing countries, pa r t icu la r ly f r o m Somalia. 

D j ibou t i has strengthened relations and partnerships with other key nations. 

5. 
In add i t ion t o D j i b o u t i ’ s strong h is to r ica l partnership with France, re la t ions with t h e 
U n i t e d States have deepened f o l l ow i n g the increased U.S. m i l i t a r y presence in the r e g i o n 
and the establishment o f a U . S . military base in the country. S im i la r ly , a Ge rman n a v a l 
base was established in M a r c h 2002 t o m o n i t o r sea t r a f f i c between Soma l ia and the

revenue f l ow s in the fo rm o f ren t p a i d f o r use o f military bases. 

6. 
Arab countries, including the United Arab Emirates, have become important 
economic allies. In 2000, D u b a i Po r ts W o r l d obtained a 20-year management contract f o r 
the Port o f D j i b o u t i and la te r t o o k over the adm in is t ra t ion o f customs and D j i b o u t i 
Airport operations. The resu l t has been a s ign i f ican t increase in investment, e f f ic iency , 
activity, and revenues in Djibouti’s ports. 

7. 
Djibouti i s internally at peace and secure. The p ow e r balance be tween the 
country’s main e thn ic groups remains a k e y determinant o f domestic p o l i t i c a l stability. 
The two ma jo r components o f D j i b o u t i ’ s popu la t ion are the Issas and the Afars. The 
fo rme r extend i n t o ne ighbo r ing Somalia, while the la t ter extend i n t o E t h i o p i a and Eritrea. 
Compe t i t ion for power be tween the t w o groups led t o a c i v i l w a r f r o m 1991 t o 1994, 
w h i c h f o rm a l l y ended th rough a peace agreement signed in 2001. In the past, close ethnic 
ties t o vo la t i le and con f l ic t -p rone ne ighbo r ing countries has sparked a n i n f l o w o f 
refugees, increasing compe t i t ion f o r already scarce resources and a f fec t ing in te rna l 
p o l i t i c a l stability. Under the current v o l a t i l e reg iona l circumstances, the country’s 
leadership i s under pressure t o a v o i d upse t t ing the precarious balance o f s tab i l i ty ; this 
s i tua t ion diminishes the Government’s a b i l i t y t o make decisions on econom ic and social 
reforms. 

8 . 
Djibouti’s political system remains dominated by the presidential majority. 
The President i s e lec ted d i rec t ly f o r a six-year t e r m and appoints a p r im e m in is te r . The 
current President, in o f f i c e since 1999, was re-elected in 2005 in a p o l l tha t was 
boyco t ted by the opposition. The Pa r l iamen t i s also elected. In t h e mos t recent 
parliamentary e lec t ion in Feb rua ry 2008, the ruling un ion p o u r la majorite‘ p r b i d e n t i e l l e 
(UMP ) coa l i t ion w o n a lands l ide victory in l o c a l and reg iona l elections and k e p t a l l 65 
seats o f the na t iona l assembly. The e lec t ion was boycotted by the oppos i t ion coalition, 
the un ion p o u r 
l ’a l te rnance de‘mocratique 
(UAD). The 
j u d i c i a r y b ranch

I n September 2008, Djibouti concluded an agreement with the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF) for a new poverty reduction and growth facility (PRGF ) . Under 
the agreement, D j i b o u t i w i l l receive U S $ 20 m i l l i o n in f inanc ia l assistance and w i l l be

Djibouti is essentially a rent-based economy, with rents deriving from its 
strategic location: port revenues, military revenues, and foreign aid. A g r i c u l t u r a l

Inflation has accelerated in 2008, mainly due to rising global prices for 
imported energy and food. The annual average i n f l a t i o n ra te rose f r o m 3.1 percent in 
2005 t o 5.0 percent in 2007, and i s estimated at 12 percent in 2008. T h i s increase i s p a r t l y 
a side e f fec t o f increased consump t ion f o l l ow i n g r a p i d econom ic expansion, but i t i s 
primarily exp la ined by the p r i ce surge o n in te rna t iona l ma rke ts f o r f o o d and energy. 
D j i b o u t i produces ve ry l i t t l e f o o d and energy domes t ica l ly and i s fully dependent o n 
imports, thus rema in ing s t ruc tu ra l ly vulnerable t o external p r ice shocks. 

13. 
Thefiscal deficit increased in 2006 and 2007, but has declined i n 2008 despite 
the food and energy crisis. D j i b o u t i ’ s f isca l stance turned f r o m slightly res t r ic t ive in

2005 (0.2 pe rcen t o f GDP) to expansionary in 2006 (-2.5 pe rcen t o f GDP) and 2007 (-2.6 
percent o f GDP) f o l l ow i n g increased spending related t o the reg iona l elections, the 
November 2006 summit o f C omm o n M a r k e t for Eastern and Southern A f r i c a 
(COMESA ) countries hosted in D j i b o u t i , and rising e lec t r ic i t y subsidies. These increased 
expenditures were o n l y partly o f fse t by the country’s stable revenue pe r fo rmance (20.3 
percent o f GD P in 2006 and 20.5 percent in 2007). The f isca l de f ic i t i s estimated at 1.9 
pe rcen t o f GDP in 2008. F isca l revenues have decreased as a r e s u l t o f the e l im i n a t i o n o f 
the consumption tax on basic f o o d i tems (about 0.5 percent o f GDP), but increased 
transfers t o the p u b l i c e lec t r ic i ty company, Electricite‘ de D j ibou t i (EDD), were l a r g e l y 
compensated th rough donors’ assistance. Over the medium term, the f isca l d e f i c i t i s 
assumed to remain stable because the Gove rnmen t intends to keep the public wage b i l l 
constant in rea l t e r m s while bene f i t ing from increased revenues th rough the i n t r o d u c t i o n 
o f a value-added tax (VAT) in January 2009. 

14. 
The widening current account deficit reflects mainly a surge in imports 
financed by FDI, but also the increase in food and o i l prices. The ex te rna l current 
account sh i f ted f r o m a sma l l d e f i c i t in 2005 t o a de f ic i t o f 25.6 pe rcen t in 2007 and o f an 
estimated 40.4 percent in 2008. T h i s increase has been offset, however, by the la rge 
cap i ta l and f inanc ia l account surplus, which has l e d gross o f f i c i a l reserves t o g r ow t o 
US$ 130 m i l l i o n at the end o f 2007 and U S $ 174 m i l l i o n at the end o f 2008. As a resu l t , 
by the end o f 2008, in te rna t iona l reserves cove red the equivalent o f about 3.3 mon ths o f 
impo r ts . 

15. 
External debt remains high. Ex te rna l debt increased f r om US$ 437 m i l l i o n in 
2006 t o U S $ 504 m i l l i o n in 2007 and US$ 614 m i l l i o n in 2008. Some 90 percent o f

GDP, debt se rv ice remains stable at 3.3 percent in 2006 and 2007 and 2.9 percent in 
2008. F o l l ow i n g the PRGF agreement between D j i b o u t i and the IMF, the Government 
and Paris C l u b creditors agreed in October 2008 t o a res t ruc tu r ing o f ex te rna l debt. The 
agreement, concluded under t h e Evian approach, was based on H o u s t o n t e rm s . I t 
included exceptional add i t iona l measures in v i e w o f D j i b o u t i ’ s limited capacity o f

in p r inc ip le to consider an e x i t debt treatment i f necessary t o restore debt sustainability at 
the end o f the current agreement’s conso l ida t ion pe r iod in 2012, p r o v i d e d tha t D j i b o u t i 
concludes a f o l l ow - u p p rog ram with the IMF, imp lemen ts comparable treatment with i t s 
other external creditors, and m a k e s a l l payments unde r the current agreement o n time. 

16. 
Monetary conditions continued to ease in 2006 and 2007, but the situation 
changed slightly in 2008. The mone y supply (M3) expanded by 17.2 percent in 2008. 
C red i t t o the private sector increased by 23 percent in 2007 after rema in ing stagnant for 
severa l years, ow i n g mainly t o consumption, construction, a p u b l i c investment b o om and 
the en t ry o f new banks. The D j i b o u t i a n f ranc depreciated against the E u r o in 2006 and 
2007. This should have im p r o v e d the competitiveness o f D j i b o u t i ’ s merchandise exports, 
but structural weaknesses such as l im i t e d na tu ra l resources, high e lec t r ic i ty and labo r 
costs, l o w skills, 
limited labo r p roduc t iv i t y , and a weak institutional env i ronmen t 
continue t o constrain the development o f expo r t sectors beyond p o r t and transportation 
services activities. 

17. 
The banking sector has been expanding rapidly. The banking sector i s w e l l 
capitalized and p ro f i tab le , and banks have p rog ress ive ly reduced their p o r t f o l i o o f 
nonpe r fonn ing loans. Four new banks launched operations in 2006-2008, ra is ing the 
numbe r o f banks in D j i b o u t i to six. Fou r add i t iona l banks are expected t o enter the 
ma rke t by the end o f 2009. The banking sector has undergone substantial structural 
changes in the past five years, i n c l u d i n g the closure o f a i l ing banks. The establishment o f 
n ew banks i s expected t o foster compe t i t ion by reduc ing b o r r ow i n g costs and w iden ing 
the numbe r o f f inanc ia l ins t rumen ts availqble t o sma l l and m e d i um enterprises (SMEs). A

18. 
Djibouti’s trade system is fully open, with no protective tariffs or non-tariff 
barriers. Because cap i ta l movemen t i s free and banking i s liberal, the coun t ry has 
become a reg iona l center f o r trade services, taking advantage o f the Po r t o f D j ibou t i ’s 
natural strategic loca t ion and increased geopo l i t ica l importance.

19. 
Th e risks of direct crisis contagion into the f inanc ia l sector remain low, due to 
the relatively underdeveloped f inanc ia l system and the largely cash-based economy. 
The stock market i s non-existent, and f inanc ia l in te rmed ia t ion i s based m a i n l y on 
banking. T h o u g h the bank ing sector has been expand ing rap id ly , there are s t i l l o n l y six 
banks in D j i b o u t i , and mos t o f them o r ig ina te f r o m deve lop ing o r emerging countries. 
Nonetheless, the t w o largest incumben t banks a re owned by large French banking groups 
and account f o r m o r e than 9 0 pe r cen t o f a l l deposits and c red i t extensions. These banks 
operate la rge ly independently and a re well capitalized, reasonably liquid, and p ro f i tab le . 
A substantial c r is is w o u l d a r i s e i f both banking systems we re affected in pa ra l le l by a 
liquidity shock and the F rench banks were n o t su f f ic ien t ly supported by the state. 

20. 
Th e impact of the global crisis on the real economy andpoverty reduction w i l l 
depend on how deeply Djibouti's major economic partners are affected 
and on 
Djibouti's own poZicy response. The m a j o r risk in the medium t e rm arises f r o m l ow e r 
FDI f lows . FDI has been high at about 31.3 percent in GDP in 2008, but i t i s expected t o 
d rop t o 8.1 percent o f GDP in 2009 due to the l i k e l y postponement o f a large new 
investment p ro jec t (construction o f second container te rm ina l in Doraleh). A l t h o u g h i t i s 
reassuring tha t many o f the planned investment p ro jec ts fo r 2009 and 2010 have been re - 
confirmed, a few, i n c l u d i n g the cons t ruc t ion o f an o i l r e f i n e r y and a p ipe l ine , are at risk 
o f being cancelled due t o the impac t o f the g loba l c r is is in home countries o f investors. 
The authorities are cu r ren t ly assessing the po ten t ia l impa c t o f the c r i s i s , in close 
coo rd ina t ion with the IMF and the W o r l d Bank. The im p a c t o f the global c r i s i s o n 
D j i b o u t i ' s economy i s p ro jec ted t o s low down FDI (B o x 2), and hence reduce the growth 
o f the economy by 1-1.5 percentage po in ts annua l ly in the medium te rm . Shou ld the 
g loba l s i tua t ion worsen, the authorities w o u l d l i k e l y have limited leverage t o m i t iga te 
such a development and w o u l d r e l y o n a tightening o f the f isca l p o s i t i o n in response to a 
decrease in revenues. Changes in i n f l a t i o n and in the exchange rate w o u l d have t o be 
c lose ly mon i to red as external pressures m a y be c o n f l i c t i n g (e.g., movements in 
commod i ty prices, adjustments in the U S $ exchange rate, s l ow down o f cap i ta l i n f l ow s 
and imports). Ex te rna l assistance, in t e rm s o f b o t h techn ica l assistance and f inanc ia l 
support, w o u l d be needed t o h e l p m i t iga te the pove r t y impact o f such a shock. 

21. 
Medium-term growth prospects w i l l be driven by investment project trends 
and the expected growth of po r t activities. Econom ic g r ow t h i s p ro jec ted t o s low d o w n 
moderately t o about 5 percent in 2009, m a i n l y due t o the postponement o f cons t ruc t ion o f 
the second container te rm ina l in Do ra leh . Over the C A S period, g r ow t h i s forecasted t o 
rebound t o rates o f about 7 percent with the expected increase in p o r t and transshipment 
ac t iv i t ies i f investments rema in stable. In a m o r e conservative scenario, the economy i s 
p ro jec ted t o g r ow at a rate o f 5 .5 percent annually in the m e d i um term. A n n u a l average 
in f la t ion , estimated at 12 percent in 2008, i s expected t o f a l l under 7.5 percent in 2009 as 
w o r l d o i l and f o o d p r ices d rop f r o m their 2008 highs. T rad i t iona l exports are forecasted 
t o continue rising in 2009-2010, f o l l ow i n g the recent expansion o f p o r t ac t iv i t ies and 
cattle processing fac i l i t ies , while the trade d e f i c i t i s expected to diminish in 2009 as a 
result o f reduced in te rna t iona l f o o d and o i l prices and a f a l l in FD I - re la ted impo r ts after

the comp le t ion o f la rge projects in 2008. The gradual p i c k - u p in FDI w i l l l i k e l y resu l t in 
a renewed widening o f current account de f ic i t s b e g i n n i n g in 2010. 

22. 
Expenditures on social and poverty reduction programs are likely to increase 
with the implementation of 
the INDS, but the fiscal position is projected to improve 

gradually after 2009. The f isca l d e f i c i t w i l l increase in 2009 due t o l ow e r grants, h ighe r 
investments, and military expenditure re la ted t o the border c o n f l i c t with E r i t rea . 
Howeve r , tax re fo rms and imp rovemen ts in tax administration, i n c l u d i n g the in t roduc t ion 
o f the VAT and the ra t iona l iza t ion o f exemptions in the Free Trade Zone in 2009, are 
expected t o increase tax revenue over the m e d i um term. The ou t look f o r increased

Debt sustainability is expected to improve in the medium term, but remains 
high. A Debt Sustainability Ana lys is (DSA) conducted in September 2008 indicates that 
the ne t presen t value (NPV) o f t o t a l p u b l i c and p u b l i c l y guaranteed ex te rna l debt (50 
percent o f GDP in 2007) i s p ro jec ted t o r em a i n above the sus ta inab i l i ty th resho ld until 
201 6, re f lec t ing short-term vulnerability. The N P V o f the debt-to-export ra t io i s p ro jec ted 
t o cross the 100 percent threshold in 2009, and t o im p r o v e considerably as a resu l t o f t h e 
expected opening o f an o i l re f ine ry in 201 1. Howeve r , the DSA indicates tha t the debt 
service-to-exports ra t io remains b e l ow the sus ta inab i l i ty th resho ld o f 1 5 percent, even 
when exports o f re f ined products are excluded f r o m the denominator. The Paris C l u b debt 
rescheduling negotiated in October 2008 has not changed substantially 
the debt 
sustainability situation, as i t s ob jec t ive was m a i n l y t o address immed ia te liquidity 
p rob lems and regularize D j i b o u t i ’ s situation vis-a-vis ex te rna l creditors, ra the r than to

The largest risk to maintaining macroeconomic stability i s associated with an 
increase in debt and a simultaneous slowdown in economic growth. At t h e t im e o f C A S

Djibouti suffers from a very weak statistical base. The last census was carried 
out in 1983, and a l l population statistics are based o n a demographic survey f rom 1991. 
This poses serious problems fo r the accuracy o f almost a l l statistics in D j ibou t i , including

Some progress has been made in improving living standards in recent years, 
and Djibouti is on track to achieve some key M i l lenn ium Development Goals (MDGs): 
MDG 2 on universal primary school enrollment, M D G 3 on gender equality, and M D G 4 
on ch i ld mortality. A W o r l d Bank assessment o f the 2004-2006 PRSP noted a few 
advancements in l i v i n g standards. Although dropout and repetition rates remain high, ne t 
primary school enrollment has grown significantly to 66.2 percent, up f r om 34.7 percent 
in 2002. The elimination o f gender inequality in school enrollment i s on track, w i t h a 
Gender Parity Index (ratio o f g i r ls to boys) o f 0.70 at the p r ima ry leve l and increased 
female literacy. In fan t and child mortality rates have improved, and malnutrition (as

Overall, however, social and human development indicators are still 
unsatisfying and depict a picture of fragility among the poor. Djibouti ranks 149th ou t o f

GOVERNMENT OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY 

A. The National Initiative f o r Soc ia l Development 

32. 

Launched in January 2007, the INDS provides a comprehensive vision for 
economic growth and poverty reduction in D j ibou t i . The strategy was comp le ted in 

January 2008 and replaces the fo rme r PRSP process (B o x 3). A m o n g i t s k e y targets are : 
(i) an economic g r ow t h rate o f about 7 percent annually; (ii) a reduc t ion in pove r t y t o 28 
percent’ by 2012; (iii) an increase o f the gross school en ro l lmen t r a t i o t o 83 percent at the 
p r im a r y l e v e l and 61 percent at the secondary leve l , accompanied by a reduc t ion in 
gender and geographical disparities; and (iv) a reduc t ion o f the infant m o r t a l i t y rate t o 6 0 
per 1,000 live births, and in the ma te rna l m o r t a l i t y rate t o 400 p e r 100,000 l i v e births. 
The new strategy r e s t s o n fou r m a i n p i l la rs . 

33 . 

Th e f i r s tp i l l a r o f the INDS aims t o ensure macroeconomic s tab i l i ty and create 
cond i t ions f o r strong and sustainable economic g r ow t h through: (i) inc reas ing p u b l i c 
investment in social sectors and sectors that generate growth, w h i l e m a i n t a i n i n g a p ruden t 
f isca l d e f i c i t and ove ra l l mac roeconom ic s tab i l i ty ; (ii) strengthening the f inanc ia l sector; 
(iii) im p r o v i n g the lega l and business env i ronmen t t o attract p r iva te investment; (iv) 
reduc ing p roduc t ion costs, no tab ly in energy, water, and communications; 
(v) 
d ive rs i fy ing t h e sources o f g row th ; (vi) im p r o v i n g the labo r environment; and (vii) 
p romo t ing D j i b o u t i as a compe t i t ive economic and services hub, taking advantage o f i t s 
geo-strategic loca t ion and l i n k s recen t ly established with key inves to rs in the reg ion . 

34. 
The secondpillar o f the INDS seeks t o develop human resources and im p r o v e 
access t o basic services, no tab l y f o r w om e n and youth. In particular, the ob jec t ives are: 
(i) im p r o v i n g access t o education, while increasing the qua l i ty o f educa t ion services, 
reduc ing gender and geographic disparities in the sector, and im p r o v i n g the management 
o f the sector; (ii) im p r o v i n g the coverage and qua l i ty o f hea l th care; (iii) reduc ing 
unemp loymen t th rough the development o f labo r intensive activities, m ic ro - f inance and 
other funding mechanisms, p r om o t i o n o f sma l l and medium enterprises, and j o b t ra in ing 
and placement; and (iv) expand ing access t o other essential services such as water, 
energy, and communications.

The th i rdp i l l a r o f the INDS, in complement t o the f i r s t t w o p i l la rs , re f lec ts the 
Government’s intent t o p romo te the ha rmon ious development o f r u r a l and urban areas by: 

This target seems very ambitious. The PRSP JSAN (September 2008) advised that indicators related to

lands improvement, and storage fac i l i t ies ; and (ii) im p r o v i n g ag r icu l tu re and l ives tock 
p roduc t iv i ty while p rese rv ing the environment. 

36. 

The fourth pillar o f the INDS seeks t o im p r o v e governance and strengthen 
p u b l i c sector management by: (i) increasing p u b l i c service e f f ic iency ; (ii) im p r o v i n g 
transparency in the budge t process; (iii) devo lv ing m o r e au tho r i ty t o decentralized leve ls

system to t rack progress t ow a r d INDS objectives. 

B. Selected Key Development Challenges 

Sustaining growth and improving competitiveness 
37. 

Diversifying the economy remains a critical challenge. The coun t ry wants t o 

d ive rs i fy the sources o f g r ow t h t o reduce i t s heavy dependence o n the services sector, 
centered o n the ports. The c rea t ion o f n ew economic ac t iv i t ies w o u l d generate add i t iona l 
f isca l revenues and sustain the country’s g r ow t h prospects. The areas that o f f e r the mos t 
tou r ism , and 
p rom is ing opportunities f o r d ive rs i f ica t ion inc lude l ives tock , fisheries, 

12 

mining. Yet t h e po ten t ia l f o r d ive rs i f ica t ion appears l i m i t e d in the medium term. A

the economies and people o f im p o r t i n g countries. Howeve r , pe r iod ic droughts have a 
negative impac t o n l ives tock p roduc t ion . F i s h p r o d u c t i o n i s estimated at 1,000 me t r ic 
tons per year with po ten t ia l f o r about 48,000 m e t r i c tons, but the d is t r ibu t ion n e tw o r k i s 
n o t operational. Tou r is t attractions inc lude several sandy beaches, ra re fauna and flora, 
and numerous islands, as well as the geographical nature o f the countryside, w h i c h 
features ravines, plains, active volcanoes, and lakes, i n c l u d i n g salt lakes such as L a k e 
Assal. There i s also t h e po ten t ia l t o develop sea tou r ism , name ly scuba diving and fish

Inves tmen t in the tou r is t sector 
i s s t i l l limited, howeve r . In mining, 
oppo r tun i t ies e x i s t m a i n l y in salt p roduc t ion , with huge reserves in L a k e Assal. 

38. 

I n order to attract more investment to D j ibou t i , the cost of doing business 
needs to be reduced significantly, especially outside the offshore centers. D j i b o u t i ’ s 

business env i ronmen t i s characterized by a d icho tomy between the conduc ive inves tmen t 
env i ronmen t o f the Free Zone and p o r t zones o n one hand, and the heavy regu la t ion o f 
the domestic economy o n the other hand. F o r example, the single w i n d ow adm in is t ra t ion 
in the Free Zone p rov ides fast, effective, and inexpensive services, a l l ow i n g a n e w 
business t o be created in a short t im e f r am e (between 3 hou rs and 3 days). The s i tua t ion 
changes d rama t ica l ly outside the Free Zone, where i t t a k e s app rox ima te ly 37 days t o 
open a business. F o rm a l consultations with the bus iness commun i ty have ind ica ted that 
the cost o f d o i n g bus iness in D j i b o u t i i s high, and tha t f i r m s (and thus p r iva te sector 
development) are pa r t icu la r ly vulnerable t o the qua l i ty , supply, and cost o f in f ras t ruc tu re 
services (especially electricity, water, telecommunications, and transport). 

39. 

Electricity access remains limited, tarvfs a re high, and the power sector 

operates under a heavy f inanc ia l burden. D j i b o u t i ’ s e lec t r i f ica t ion rate rema ins low , 
with o n l y 57 percent o f urban areas connected t o the grid. In a recent survey o f SMEs 
comm iss ioned by the W o r l d BankY6 the l a c k o f a reliable, secure, and low -cos t energy 
supp ly was c i ted by m o r e than h a l f o f interviewees as t h e single mos t severe constraint t o 
do ing business in D j i b o u t i . Rea l generation capacity i s limited (1 19 M W installed, but 
o n l y an average o f 57 M W was e f fec t ive ly ope ra t iona l in 2008), and re l ies primarily o n 
an ageing plant running o n expensive impo r ted f u e l o i l . A s popu la t ion g r ow t h and

and leaves v e r y l i t t l e reserve f o r generation equ ipmen t maintenance o r other unexpected 
accidents. In addition, e lec t r ic i ty ta r i f f s (averaging U S $ 0.32 p e r KWh) are high due t o 
persistently elevated o i l p r ices and va r ious techn ica l and non - techn ica l ine f f ic ienc ies o f

Over the medium to long term, the Government plans to strengthen the 
availability of electricity by linking up with the considerable and more affordable 
hydropower resources available in Ethiopia. T h i s link w o u l d t a k e p lace th rough an 

electric interconnection transmission l i n e funded by the A f r i c a n Deve lopmen t B a n k 
(AfDB), w h i c h i s expected t o be comp le ted by m id -2010 . At the same time, the 
Government o f D j i b o u t i w o u l d seek t o m a i n t a i n some degree o f energy independence by 
rep lac ing and expanding i t s t rad i t iona l the rma l generation capacity, and by deve lop ing 
alternative sources o f energy. Plans inc lude the exp lo ra t ion and deve lopmen t o f 
D j i b o u t i ’ s own geothermal resources, in partnership with fo re ign investors. 

The telecommunications sector is also characterized by limited access and 

41. 
high costs. D j i b o u t i Telecom, the p u b l i c te lecommun ica t ions company, i s the sole service 
p rov ide r in the country. The company i s ve r t ica l ly integrated and p rov ides landline, 
m o b i l e (GSM), and In te rne t services t o the entire coun t ry under a m o n o p o l y business 
mode l . O w i n g t o the absence o f an e f fec t ive and independent te lecommun ica t ions 
regulator, the incumben t also undertakes regu la to ry functions. T a r i f f s are the highest in 
the region, and cheap alternative services such as V o i c e ove r In te rne t P ro toco l (Vo IP ) a re 
b locked by the incumben t at i t s p o i n t o f access t o t h e external w o r l d . Ins ta l la t ion o f 
satellite-based technology ( V S A T ) i s also n o t allowed, as a “protectionist” strategy f o r 
t h e incumbent. I11 management o f frequency spectrum and numbering leads t o fu r the r

Road maintenance funding is inadequate, and the century-old railway to 

Ethiopia needs to be upgraded. The established road ne two rk i s su f f ic ien t t o m e e t 
D j i b o u t i ’ s needs, but qua l i ty suffers due t o p o o r sector o rgan iza t ion and insu f f ic ien t 
funding o f road maintenance. The in f ras t ruc tu re and equipment o f the D j i b o u t i -E t h i o p i a 
r a i lw a y are in poo r techn ica l cond i t ion , and the Chemin de Fer D j ibou t i -E th iop ie (CDE ) 
i s de facto f inanc ia l ly bankrupt. The r a i lw a y o n l y covers a 5 percent share o f the transit 
t r a f f i c t o Ethiopia, a l though i t w o u l d make economic sense f o r b o t h D j i b o u t i and E t h i o p i a

attempts t o concession the r a i lw a y t o a p r iva te operator have been unsuccessful t o date.

The poor are vulnerable and not sufficiently protected against the impact of 

systemic crises and other shocks. As ind ica ted above, droughts, f loods and other na tu ra l

Strengthening governance 

5 1. 

Institutional capacity i s weak, but the Government is committed to making 
improvements. Despite D j i b o u t i ’ s f a i r l y elevated per-capita income, ins t i tu t iona l capacity 
i s constrained by 
insu f f ic ien t s k i l l s and management capacity 
in the p u b l i c 
administration, as well as by the f ragmen ta t ion o f dec is ion -mak ing processes. Howeve r , 
the authorities appear comm i t ted t o making con t inued imp rovemen ts in governance. The 
President o f the Repub l ic ind ica ted recen t ly that im p r o v i n g governance i s one o f the 
highest government p r io r i t ies , and has requested the Bank’s assistance in conduc t ing a 
governance and an t i -co r rup t ion survey. 

52. 
Public finance management and economic governance have improved 
recently, but risks remain. A 2004 Coun t ry F inanc ia l Accoun tab i l i t y Assessment 
(CFAA ) iden t i f ied serious weaknesses in budget p repa ra t ion and execution, as w e l l as in 
in te rna l con t ro l . T o m i t iga te t h i s risk, an ac t ion plan was developed cons is t ing of: (i) 
upg rad ing the p r im a r y budget f u n c t i o n (revenues and expenditures); (ii) r e f o rm i n g 
in te rna l con t ro l procedures and upg rad ing in te rna l audit; and (iii) conduc t ing a s tudy o n 
h o w t o better coordinate the three m a i n aud i t bodies.12 Imp lemen ta t ion o f the ac t ion plan 
has p rov ided the system with the basic too ls and procedures o f budge t management. The 
Budget D i rec to ra te n o w has better capacity (human and technical) t o formulate, prepare, 
and execute the budget in m o r e rea l is t ic conditions, but mo re w o r k i s needed t o 
imp lemen t results-oriented budgeting within a mu l t i -yea r perspective. In addition, l i t t l e 
progress has been achieved in r e f o rm i n g the in te rna l con t ro ls and granting m o r e 
au tonomy t o l i n e m in is t r ies . P r io r i t ies f o r re in fo r c ing and im p r o v i n g c r i t i c a l aspects o f

Adequate policy planning and implementation rely on improving data 
availability and enhancing statistical capacity. As stated above, the las t census was 
conducted in 1983, and data accuracy i s a m a j o r issue. According t o the IMF, weaknesses 
a re pa r t icu la r ly acute in the areas o f national accounts, trade, ex te rna l debt, and some 
f isca l data. There i s an i n d i c a t i o n that awareness o f the impo r tance o f statistics among 
government o f f ic ia ls i s increasing. In 2006, Djibouti re ce ived a grant f r o m the Trust Fund

WORLD BANK EXPERIENCE UNDER THE PREVIOUS CAS 

A. Progress toward CAS Outcomes f o r 2005-2008 

54. 
With an envelope of SDR 14.6 million (about US$22 million), the 2005-2008 
CAS was aligned to the 2002 PRSP. I t focused o n three PRSP pillars: (i) g r ow t h and 
competitiveness; (ii) human resources development; and (iii) g o o d governance. 
F o l l ow i n g i s a brief r e v i ew o f progress achieved in these areas ove r the p rev ious C A S 
pe r iod . A mo re detailed eva lua t ion o f progress i s inc luded in the C A S C om p l e t i o n Repo r t 
(CAS CR) in Annex 2. 

5 5 . 

Outcomes in the areas o f growth and competitiveness 
The CAS CR concluded that the growth outcome was achieved. IDA 
assistance in this area was designed to help D j i b o u t i to: (i) r e f o rm p u b l i c expenditure, 
i n c l u d i n g by reduc ing the unsustainable share o f the wage bill; (ii) restructure the u t i l i t i e s 
sector t o enhance competitiveness and imp rove access among p o o r people; and (iii) 
develop the transport sector t o enhance the Po r t o f D j i b o u t i as an eng ine f o r g r ow t h and 
employment. G r ow t h accelerated t o 4.8 percent in 2006 and 5.3 in 2007, and i s l i k e l y t o 
rema in strong at 5.9 percent in 2008. 

56. 
The sustainability of 
this growth path, however, depends on the continued 
attraction of 
foreign investment through reducing factor costs, maintaining fiscal 
stability, and upgrading manpower skills. A l t h o u g h the r a t i o o f tax revenues t o GD P 
remained stable at about 2 0 percent, expenditures increased by about 2 percent o f GD P 
f r o m 2005 t o 2007. Increased spending l e d t o a r i s e in the f isca l de f ic i t , w h i c h was 
exacerbated by the 2008 spike in o i l and f o o d prices. A c c o r d i n g t o the D S A conducted by 
IMF and W o r l d Bank s t a f f in 2008, D j i b o u t i ’ s risk o f debt distress remains high but 
appears manageable. F ina l ly , the C A S C R no ted that, during the previous C A S period, 
the coun t ry fa i led t o address high labo r costs and skill shortages, o r t o restructure u t i l i t i e s 
as a means o f res to r ing f inanc ia l v i a b i l i t y and reduc ing ta r i f fs . 

Outcomes in human resources development 

57. 
I n the area of human resources development, the CAS focused on a range of 
activities: (i) im p r o v e d access t o and qua l i ty o f education; (ii) emp loymen t generation 
th rough commun i ty development schemes; (iii) assistance f o r vu lne rab le groups w h o 

18 

were affected by na tu ra l catastrophes (pa r t icu la r ly floods); and (iv) advancements o n key 

social issues, such as gender equality, the fight against FGM, and the abuse o f qat. 

5 8 . 

Tangible results were achieved in education and health. The Gross E n r o l lm e n t 
Ra t io (GER) at the p r im a r y l e v e l increased f r o m 5 2 percent in 2005 t o 68 percent in ea r ly 
2008, i n c l u d i n g f o r girls, and the p r im a r y repe t i t ion ra te was reduced f r o m over 10 
percen t in 2005 t o 4 percent in 2008. G o o d progress was made in the development o f 

school management comm i t tees , which i s helping t o improve resu l ts . Howeve r , 

comp le t ion rates have deteriorated over the last schoo l year as a r e s u l t o f the dec is ion t o 
shorten the primary cyc le f r o m 6 t o 5 years. In the health sector, the p r o p o r t i o n o f births 
taking place in hea l th fac i l i t ies increased f r o m 40 percent in 2002 t o 93 percent in 2008, 
and imm u n i z a t i o n o f ch i ld ren aged 12-23 mon ths grew f r o m 45 percent t o 7 1 percent 
during the same period. The prevalence o f H IV among pregnant w om e n aged 15-24 
dec l ined from 2.7 pe rcen t in 2002 t o 2.1 pe rcen t in 2007, and among patients be ing 
treated for sexua l ly t ransm i t ted in fec t ions f r o m 2 2 percent to 12.6 percent over t h e same 
timeframe. N o i n f o rm a t i o n i s available o n the popu la t ion ’s awareness o f H IV p reven t ion 
methods. 

59. 
Access to basic economic and social infrastructure has improved in 21 poor 
neighborhoods covered by the IDA-funded Public Works and Social Development 
program. O n l y 8,300 person-months o f w o r k was created, as compared t o the target o f 
17,500; i t has become clear that this amb i t ious target was un rea l is t ic . The capacity o f the 
imp lemen t ing agency, ADDS, has been strengthened. Howeve r , the number o f p o o r 
residents benefiting from the IDA-funded p ro jec t i s n o t w e l l established, and i t i s d i f f i c u l t 
t o assess the operation’s e f f ic iency due t o the l a c k o f economic analysis o f sub-projects. 

60. 
There i s a greater awareness of 
the negative impact of qat consumption on 
labor productivity and health. The planned analysis o f the soc ia l and econom ic 
imp l ica t ions o f qat impo r ta t ion and eonsump t ion at the househo ld and mac ro l e v e l was

B. Portfolio Management 

62. 
As of end-February 2009, the current IDA portfolio comprises f ive operations. 
Total IDA funding volume stands at US$ 43.5 m i l l ion , with an undisbursed balance o f 
US$ 14.5 m i l l ion . The ongoing IDA program focuses on health, education, energy, and 
public works. In addition, as o f February 2009, Djibouti had an active po r t fo l io o f 13 
t r u s t fund grants (Bank and country executed) fo r a total commitment o f U S $ 14.8 
m i l l ion , o f wh ich US$ 2.1 m i l l i o n remains undisbursed (Annex 3). These funds include a 
US$ 6 m i l l i o n grant fully disbursed f r om the Education fo r A l l Catalytic Fund, a U S $ 5 
million grant f u l l y disbursed f rom the G loba l Food Crisis Response Program, a US$ 2 
m i l l i o n Av ian Flu grant, and other (smaller) grants from t h e Global A l l iance fo r Vaccines 
and Immunization (GAVI), the Global Environment Fac i l i ty (GEF), the Institutional 
Development Fund (IDF), the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) 
and TFSCB. As o f end-February 2009, a l l projects a re rated satisfactory. The 
disbursement ratio for the en t i re po r t fo l io was 44 percen t fo r FY2008, against 34 pe rcen t 
in FY2007. 

63. 
Portfolio performance has been broadly satisfactory. In June 2008, the Bank 
and the Government completed a Country Po r t fo l io Performance Rev iew (CPPR). I t 
concluded that projects in D j i b o u t i a re broadly well implemented and reach their 
development objectives. Success factors include: (i) focused and simple project design, 
adapted to Djibouti’s implementation capacity; (ii) intensive supervision o f the po r t fo l io , 
with a problem-solving approach buttressed by a strong dialogue with the Government 
and support f rom the Country Management Unit; (iii) strong fiduciary track record; and 
(iv) proactive involvement o f the M in is t ry o f Economy and Finance’s External Financing 
Unit in fo l low ing up with sectoral ministries and Project Implementation Units (PIUs). 

64. 
The CPPR highlighted some generic portfolio management issues for 
particular attention. These include: (i) slow s t a r t o f projects, as exemplified by delays 
between project approval and effectiveness; (ii) procurement delays; (iii) need fo r be t te r 
integration o f project monitoring and evaluation functions in the l i n e ministries; (iv) need 
fo r an increased role fo r government institutions (such as the C o w des Comptes) in 
project management, such as in project audits; and (v) need fo r stronger capacity in the 
daily management o f t r u s t fund grants. An action plan has been drawn up t o address these 
issues, and i s under implementation b y the Government.

PROPOSED WORLD BANK STRATEGY 

A. Guiding Principles 
65. 
The CAS for FY2009-2012 is aligned with the INDS. Through bo th the 
existing po r t fo l io and new lending, t h e Bank Group w i l l support the implementation o f 
the four-year INDS and help achieve a number o f INDS goals. The CAS resu l ts 
framework i s directly aligned with development outcomes derived f r om the INDS. The 
program o f assistance was discussed with the Government, donors, private sector, and 
c i v i l society during CAS consultations in D j i b o u t i between November 2008 and February 
2009. 

20 

66. 
The new CAS is highly selective. Cons ide r ing the Bank ’s experience in 
D j i b o u t i , the limited IDA envelope, other stakeholders’ ac t iv i t ies in the country, and the 
lessons lea rned about e f fec t ive development approaches in sma l l states, l3 Bank support 
w i l l target o n l y a few ac t iv i t ies . The B a n k w i l l p rov ide a grant f o r one p ro jec t per year 
and undertake one or t w o ana ly t ica l studies per year, while m a i n t a i n i n g a constructive 
dialogue in a broader set o f sectors through techn ica l assistance. 

67. 
The new CAS is built on the success of the current portfolio. There are la rge 
financing needs in a l l sectors. Howeve r , given l i m i t e d capacity o n the Gove rnmen t s ide 
and the Bank ’s experience in f ew sectors, the proposed C A S intends to focus o n areas 
where the Bank has a s o l i d pe r fo rmance record. In particular, wherever possible, the C A S 
w i l l p rov ide add i t iona l financing f o r projects tha t have achieved their development 
objectives in order t o scale up impac t and strengthen development effectiveness. 

68. 
Bank activities w i l l reflect the Bank’s comparative advantage and complement 
the work of other donors. The choice o f ac t iv i t ies t o be supported in this C A S depends 
largely o n the Government’s p r io r i t ies , but also on the extent and nature o f support being 
p rov ided by other donors. Care w i l l be taken t o a v o i d the dup l ica t ion o f in te rven t ions and 
emphasis w i l l be p laced o n ac t iv i t ies where the Bank has a compa ra t ive advantage in 
light o f other donors’ invo lvemen t , expertise, and f inanc ia l con t r ibu t ions . Co - f inanc ing 
programs with other donors w i l l be considered as a means t o leverage the Bank’s l im i t e d 
f inanc ia l con t r ibu t ion . 

69. 
The overall size of the IDA envelope during the CASpe r iod i s assumed to be 
about SDR 16 m i1 l i0n . l~ The C A S covers the p e r i o d FY2009 -2012 , w h i c h inc ludes the 
entire I D A 1 5 p e r i o d (FY2009 -201 l), and the f i r s t year o f I D A 1 6 . The F Y 2 0 0 9 a l loca t ion 
w i l l be SDR 3.6 m i l l i o n . A l loca t ions f o r FY2010 -2012 are expected to be about SDR 3.8 
m i l l i o n per year, on average, but these estimates can change. A c t u a l a l loca t ions in these 
years w i l l depend on: (i) t o t a l available IDA resources; (ii) the coun t ry ’s performance 
r a t i n g according t o the Coun t ry P o l i c y and Ins t i tu t iona l Assessmen t (CPIA); (iii) the 
performance and assistance terms o f other IDA borrowers; (iv) the terms o f IDA’S 
assistance t o D j i b o u t i (grants o r credits); and (v) the number o f I D A - e l i g i b l e countries. 
The ind ica t ive a l loca t ion f o r FY 2 0 1 2 assumes tha t the I D A 1 6 rep len ishmen t w i l l be at 
the same l e v e l as in I D A 1 5 . Since D j i b o u t i i s in debt distress, i t w i l l receive a l l i t s 
allocations in the f o r m o f grants u n l e s s i t s debt sustainability p o s i t i o n changes. 

70. 
This CAS intends to leverage IDA grants through access to global funds. 
Given that the IDA a l loca t ion i s l im i t e d in compa r ison t o the coun t ry ’s f inanc ing needs, 
the Bank w i l l continue t o seek to leverage these resources th rough access t o g loba l funds 
(e.g., Ca rbon Fund, EFA, GEF, IDA Guarantees) and t o w o r k with D j i b o u t i t o im p r o v e

B. Proposed Assistance Strategy 

71. 

With the above principles in mind, the Bank Group strategv i s articulated 
around three core objectives. The C A S themes are : (i) suppo r t ing economic g row th ; (ii) 
supporting access t o basic social services and human development; and (iii) suppo r t ing 
governance and p u b l i c sector management. 

CAS Theme 1: Supporting economic growth 

Reducing constraints and associated costs to private sector development (CAS 

72. 
Outcome 1.1). Acce le ra t ing economic g r ow t h w i l l requ i re strengthening the business 
environment by reduc ing t h e constraints and costs o f d o i n g business in D j i b o u t i . Building 
o n the assistance that began under the p rev ious CAS , the Bank w i l l support the 
Government’s e f fo r ts t o boost p r iva te sector deve lopmen t by: (i) inc reas ing access to, and 
r e l i a b i l i t y ‘and qua l i ty o f service delivery in the e lec t r ic i ty and te lecommun ica t ions 
sectors; (ii) reduc ing the cost o f e lec t r ic i ty and te lecommun ica t ions services; (iii) 
im p r o v i n g the e f f ic iency o f p u b l i c u t i l i t i e s f o r e lec t r ic i ty , water, and telecommunications; 
and (iv) strengthening the f inanc ia l sector. The Bank p r o g r am w i l l i n v o l v e a comb ina t ion 
o f lend ing in the p ow e r sector and techn ica l assistance t o enhance the business 
environment. 

73. 

Ongoing assistance. Th rough the ongo ing Powe r Access and D i v e r s i f i c a t i o n 
p ro jec t (US$ 7 m i l l ion ) , the Bank has he lped EDD expand e lec t r ic i ty d i s t r i b u t i o n and 
i d e n t i f y key system e f f ic iency gaps; i t has also p r o v i d e d funds t o buy f u e l f o r e lec t r ic i ty 
generation, thus o f f e r i n g r e l i e f to EDD’s strained finances and, in turn, reduc ing the f isca l 
cost o f the sector while assessing oppo r tun i t ies f o r better f u e l p rocu remen t practices. In 
addition, ongo ing techn ica l assistance t o the design o f a master plan f o r e lec t r ic i t y w i l l 
support m o r e e f fec t ive and econom ica l ly sound p lann ing f o r n ew investments in the 
e lec t r ic i ty sector. 

74. 
Planned assistance. Th rough a p roposed n e w energy p ro jec t (US$ 6.2 m i l l ion ) , 
the Bank w i l l help D j i b o u t i to: (i) imp rove access t o e lec t r ic i ty th rough targeted energy 
e f f ic iency and demand-side management measures tha t w o u l d reduce the user cost o f 
electricity, while shaving o f f peak demand and tape r ing EDD’s need f o r large, cap i ta l - 
intensive investments in n ew generation capacity; and (ii) im p r o v e EDD ’ s ove ra l l 
performance th rough h igh - impac t techn ica l and non - techn ica l loss reduc t ion measures 
that w o u l d increase the r e l i a b i l i t y and qua l i ty o f e lec t r ic i ty services at a l ow e r ope ra t ing 
cost. 

75 . 

The Bank ’s techn ica l assistance in the te lecommun ica t ions sector w i l l p r o v i d e 
recommendations f o r p o l i c y and regu la to ry re fo rm . Techn ica l assistance w i l l also b e 
p rov ided t o assess the needs, priorities, and challenges in enhancing the coun t ry ’s 
business env i ronmen t and investment c l ima te . The Bank has undertaken, j o i n t l y with the 
IMF, an FSAP t o help design measures t o strengthen the banking regu la to ry f ramewo rk . 
Th is exercise i s mo t iva ted by the fact that the banking sector has expanded r a p i d l y and 
undergone substantial structural changes in the past three years, i n c l u d i n g the closure o f 

2 2 

a i l ing banks. Similarly, techn ica l assistance may be provided to help the Central Bank o f 
D j i b o u t i manage i t s foreign exchange rese rves . 

76. 
IFC . In an effort to support the development o f alternative sources o f energy in 
Djibouti, IFC made an early stage equity investment with Reyk jav ik Energy Invest t o 
develop a geothermal power project in FY2008. This was the f i r s t investment by the new 
InfraVentures facility, intended t o provide seed funding to promising projects that are no t 
yet able t o secure full funding. The project has encountered delays, inc lud ing as a resu l t 
o f the financial c r i s i s in I c e l a n d and the general uncertainty o f raising the balance o f 
funding required fo l low ing the global financial crisis. I FC i s currently wo rk ing with the 
sponsor group t o undertake i n i t i a l te s t drilling, raise the additional capital required, and 
complete the feasibility assessmen t . I f these activities proceed with strong resu l ts , the 
project could be structured and f inanced by end-FY2010. I f implemented, the project 
cou ld help D j ibou t i address i t s power shortage and reduce carbon emissions. 

77. 

M IGA . MIGA has a substantial engagement in D j ibou t i . In December 2007, 
MIGA issued US$ 427 m i l l i o n in investment guarantees related to t h e development, 

design, construction, management, operation, and maintenance o f a container terminal in 
Doraleh. At the time o f i t s issuance, this constituted MIGA’s largest single project 
exposure. This ongoing coverage extends fo r a period o f 10 years against the r i s k s o f 
t rans fe r restriction, expropriation, war and c i v i l disturbance, and breach o f contract. The 
project, sponsored by investors f rom the United Arab Emirates, i s expected t o help 
Djibouti become a major bus iness hub in East A f r i c a b y imp rov ing fac i l i t ies , increasing 
po r t traffic, and opening up new opportunities for investment and g row th (such as 
attracting other A f r ican coun t r ies t o u s e the po r t as a gateway as well). I f FDI remains 
significant, MIGA wou ld be w i l l i n g to provide more assistance as needed. 

CAS Theme 2: Supporting access to basic social services and human development 
78. 
Increase access to quality basic education (CAS Outcome 2.1). The Bank has 
been invo lved in this area over the past four years, in collaboration with key donors such 
as the AfDB, I s l am i c Development Bank (IsDB), United States, France, and Japan. 
Du r ing this CAS period, the Bank w i l l continue to wo rk closely with other donors t o 
support the Government’s e f fo r ts to: (i) further expand access to basic education, 
especially in ru ra l areas and fo r girls, inc lud ing by reducing dropout and repetition rates; 
and (ii) enhance the quality o f education, especially by increasing teacher training and the 
availability o f school books. 

79. 
Ongoing assistance. IDA w i l l continue to support the implementation o f the 
Government’s education re fo rm agenda with a US$ 10 m i l l i o n School Access and 
Improvement project. This project has been implemented in parallel with an F T I 
education grant o f U S $ 6 m i l l ion , managed by the Bank. 

80.

Djibouti benefits from the support of a small group of bilateral donors (e.g., 
France, United States, U n i t e d A r a b Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait) and multilateral 
donors (A rab Fund fo r Econom ic and Soc ia l Development, IsDB, AfDB, Eu ropean 
Commission, OPEC Fund f o r In te rna t iona l Development, United Na t ions agencies, IMF,

This CAS was prepared i n close collaboration with the donor community, and 
is designed to complement other donors’ efforts. In key areas, such as the Powe r and 
Urban Pove r ty Reduc t ion projects, IDA’S lending assistance has been p repa red in close 
co l labo ra t ion with AfDB, IsDB, and AFD and complements their inves tmen ts in these 
sectors. As shown in the C A S r e s u l t s m a t r i x (Annex 1)’ the re are many synergies 
between IDA assistance and other donors’ proposed interventions. These l i n k s w i l l be

MANAGING R I S K S 

94. 

The realization of Djibouti’s national initiative for social development, and 
the effectiveness of 
this CAS which is aligned to it, are subject to several external and 
internal risks. 

95 * 

Djibouti’s economy depends mainly on the por t and i ts development, the 
rental of military bases, and grants and soft f inanc ing from d o n o r s - a l l of which are 
subject to external geo-political and f inanc ia l uncertainties. The surge in the g r ow t h o f 
p o r t ac t iv i t ies with E t h i o p i a since the end o f the 1990s i s attributable t o the w a r be tween 
E th iop ia and Eritrea, and E th iop ia ’s subsequent reliance o n the Po r t o f D j i b o u t i f o r mos t 
o f i t s impo r ts and exports. To limit the risk tha t th is increase in the share o f E th iop ian 
trade t ra f f ic w i l l be reversed, D j i b o u t i needs t o imp rove the ove ra l l competitiveness o f 
the p o r t by reduc ing costs and im p r o v i n g transport l i n k s (road and ra i lways ) t o E th iop ia . 
T h i s risk i s be ing m i t iga ted th rough the ongo ing mode rn iza t ion o f the P o r t o f D j i b o u t i , 
and the construction o f a container te rm ina l and o i l te rm ina l and c rea t ion o f a Free Zone 
at the Po r t o f Doraleh. There i s also the prospect that large investments f r o m the United 
A r a b Emirates m a y support the development o f D j i b o u t i as a transshipment hub. 

19 

Partners include AfDB, IsDB, AFD, Japan, the World Food Program (WFP), the United Nations 
Children’s Fund (UNICEF), and the World Bank. 

27 

96 . 
Djibouti faces the risk of 
lower FDI flows if 
the global f inanc ia l and 
economic crisis persists and affects Djibouti’s main partners. A s stressed in section 11, 
although many planned inves tmen t projects f o r 2009 and 2010 have been re-confirmed, a 
few projects can be jeopardized, i f the g loba l c r is is hits hard the home countries o f m a i n 
investors. I f th is happens, the authorities w o u l d l i k e l y have limited leverage t o m i t iga te 
such a development and w o u l d rely o n a tightening o f the f i s c a l pos i t ion in response t o a 
decrease in revenues . Ex te rna l assistance, in terms o f techn ica l assistance and f inanc ia l 
support, w o u l d be needed t o h e l p m i t iga te the impac t o f such a shock. 

97 . 

Djibouti is located in an unstable region that has experienced many wars and 
episodes of civil unrest. In M a y 2008 , border tensions with E r i t rea led t o brief fighting 
between the t w o countries’ a rm i e s . The s i tua t ion i s n o w stable, though there have been n o 
direct negotiations between the t w o parties. D j i b o u t i ’ s high refugee popu la t ion , a resu l t o f 
reg iona l ins tab i l i ty , creates tensions around access t o already scarce na t iona l resources, 
such as food, water, and land f o r grazing. There i s a risk tha t reg iona l secu r i ty cond i t ions 
cou ld worsen and the numbe r o f refugees w o u l d increase. This s i tua t ion w o u l d l i k e l y lead 
t o f isca l unsus ta inab i l i ty due t o increased spending o n defense and in te rna l security, as 
w e l l as the add i t iona l service needs o f the refugee popu la t ion . Such cond i t ions w o u l d also 
affect the Bank’s a b i l i t y t o implement i t s programs. This r i s k w i l l be c lose ly mon i to red 
throughout the C A S pe r iod . Ano the r impo r tan t reg iona l risk i s linked t o sea p i r a c y in the 
Gulf o f Aden, as this can pose a threat t o trade th rough the Po r t o f D j i b o u t i . In a bid t o 
address the insecu r i ty and ins tab i l i ty that has a l l ow e d the p i r a c y t o grow, the Gove rnmen t 
i s con t inu ing t o p l a y an active r o l e in fac i l i ta t ing discussions o n the f u t u r e o f the 
government in Somalia. I t w i l l also coordinate i t s e f fo r ts with the Gove rnmen t o f Yemen. 

98 . 
The Bank’s limited f inanc ia l assistance could also pose risks for 
the 
effectiveness of 
the CASp rog ram . I t i s possible tha t the Gove rnmen t m a y n o t consider 
the f inanc ia l support under the C A S su f f ic ien t f o r them t o invest in pu rsu ing a long - te rm 
dialogue and re la t ionsh ip with the Bank. The Bank w i l l o f fse t this risk by w o r k i n g t o 
ensure greater engagement and m u t u a l understanding o n the C A S with the D j i b o u t i a n 
Government and stakeholders, in order t o highlight the Bank’s va lue in bringing t o bear a 
va r ie ty o f non - f inanc ia l instruments o f assistance, i n c l u d i n g p o l i c y advice, ana ly t ica l 
work, and techn ica l assistance based o n the Bank’s g loba l know ledge and reach, support 
t o I N D S implementation, access t o g loba l funds, and a conven ing p ow e r tha t can h e l p 
leverage other donors’ assistance f o r greater development effectiveness in D j i b o u t i . 

99. 
Another source of 
risk relates to the Government’s limited capacity to 
implement and monitor the INDS. Full imp lemen ta t ion o f the I N D S p r o g r am im p l i e s a 
s ign i f ican t increase in D j i b o u t i ’ s p u b l i c investment p rog ram in a con tex t o f re la t ive ly l o w 
skill leve ls and limited budgetary, administrative, and management capacity. Expe r ience 
f r o m the p rev ious C A S shows that we l l - focused p ro jec ts with simple des ign and close 
and p roac t ive supervision, together with add i t iona l capacity building assistance, can 
s ign i f ican t ly m i n im i z e this r isk . The highly selective approach t o d e f i n i n g the proposed 
C A S p rog ram w i l l also h e l p address this r isk . Nonetheless, 
ins t i tu t iona l capacity 
constraints c o u l d po ten t ia l ly limit the Government’s a b i l i t y t o u t i l i z e fully and e f fec t ive ly 
the increased support f r o m other donors. IDA w i l l keep this broader issue unde r rev iew .

Da te o f CAS: Ma rch 1,2005 
Per iod covered by CAS Comp le t ion Report: FY2005-2008 

I. INTRODUCTION 

1. 
This annex reviews 
the experience 
imp lemen t ing 
the 
In terna t iona l Deve lopmen t 
Association’s (IDA) Coun try Assistance Strategy (CAS) fo r the pe r iod FY05 -08 (Report 3 1613-DJ) 
dated March 1, 2005, wh ich was endorsed by the Boa rd on M a r c h 24, 2005. I t assesses the 
effectiveness o f IDA ’S strategy in (i) a l ign ing i t s objectives with D j ibou t i ’s long- term strategic 
goals; (ii) se t t ing relevant, measurable and realistic C A S outcomes; and (iii) ach iev ing i t s expected 
outcomes in an e f f ic ien t and sustainable way . I t evaluates IDA ’S performance in designing i t s 
strategy taking past assessments and lessons in to consideration (such as Independent Eva lua t ion 
Group - IEG - evaluations); and p resen ts a se t o f lessons fo r subsequent C A S design. In add i t ion t o 
discussions with the country team and government counterparts, this assessment i s based on 
reference documents such as the CAS, Pro jec t Appra isa l Documents (PADS) Imp lemen ta t ion Status 
and Resu l ts Reports (ISRs), supervision reports (Aide-Memoires, and Back - to o f f ice Reports), 
reports related t o Economic and Sector Work , Imp lemen ta t ion Comp le t ion Reports (ICRs), and 
Independent Eva lua t ion Group (IEG) reports and Project Assessmen ts . 

11. Context o f the 2005-2008 CAS 

11. a. Djibouti.Longer Term Strategic Goals 

2. 
D j i b o u t i adopted i t s first Pover ty Reduc t ion Strategy Paper (PRSP-I) in M a y 2004, in a 
context marked by a wo r ry ing surge in pove r ty and g lar ing disparities be tween ru ra l and urban 
areas. The PRSP aimed at: (i) strengthening competitiveness fo r higher and sustainable g row th by 
ma in ta in ing overa l l macroeconomic stability, wh i le speeding up structural reforms t o create a better 
investment climate fo r pr iva te investment; (ii) accelerating human development through improved 
school enrollment and qua l i ty o f education, strengthening the health care system, broadening the 
social safety net; and imp lemen t ing the na t iona l gender strategy; (iii) p romo t ing reg iona l and loca l 
development t o reach out to poor urban neighborhoods, nomads, and isolated ru ra l communities; 
and ( iv) imp rov ing governance and pub l ic sector management through greater transparency and 
accountability. 

3 . 
Good progress was made in ach iev ing the objectives o f PRSP-I. Econom ic g row th 
accelerated f rom 1.6 percent in 2004 t o 4.8 percent in 2006 and 5.3 percent estimated fo r 2007, 
fue l led by increased i n f l ow o f fore ign d irec t investment in port-related ac t iv i t ies and construction. 
Progress was also made in imp rov ing key social indicators. Acco rd ing t o the 2006 household 
survey (EDIM), progress was made in imp rov ing access t o p r ima ry education (enro l lmen t rates 
increased f rom 42.7 pe rcen t in 2000 t o 66.2 percent in 2006), increasing alphabetization among 
young females, and reduc ing in fan t mo r ta l i ty . D j i b o u t i was able t o ma in ta in macroeconomic 
stability, accelerate g row th and improve some social indicators, but the re i s l i t t l e ind ica t ion that 
pover ty has been reduced. 

4. 
Imp lemen ta t ion o f the PRS - I s lowed down after the f i r s t year, and planned programs were 
on l y pa r t ia l ly implemented, pa r t icu la r ly in the second pillar o f developing human capital. Resource 

33 

gaps, administrative capacity constraints and the lack o f an e f fec t ive mon i to r ing and evaluation 
system are the ma in reasons behind the poor and limited imp lemen ta t ion o f the strategy. Lea rn ing 
f rom the PRSP-I weaknesses, the Government adopted a Na t iona l In i t ia t ive fo r Social Deve lopmen t 
( In i t ia t ive Na t iona le p o u r le De'veloppement Soc ia l - INDS) in January 2008. This i s a p rov is iona l 
document, wh ich wou ld be f ina l ized fo l low ing comp le t ion o f the demographic census. The INDS 
rev iewed progress under t h e PRSP-I. I t emphasized achievements in the social sectors, but noted 
that PRSP- I never became the sole frame o f reference f o r decision-makers, and that the cu l ture o f 
p lann ing was no t well established among the authorities. Key indicators o f progress under PRSP-1 
are in Table 1 be low .

11. b. The 2005-2008 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) 

5 . 
The 2005-08 C A S ind ica ted that so l id performance had been achieved under the prev ious 
CAS (2001-04), ma rk ing a clear departure f rom the past. After a l o n g pe r iod o f c i v i l s t r i f e and 
deepening pover ty in the 1990s, g row th and macroeconomic s tab i l i ty were restored. Performance o f 
the po r t fo l io improved dramatically. During the consultation process f o r prepar ing the CAS, the 
Bank team and the authorities discussed two options. The f i r s t op t ion was t o target one o f the fou r 
p i l la rs t o b r ing about c r i t ica l change in that particular area, taking account o f limited IDA 
allocation. The second op t ion was t o use sma l l but strategic interventions mixing lending and 
economic and sector w o r k (ESW) in each o f the four areas. The second op t ion was selected. The 
risk o f the approach was t o spread limited resources too thinly. W i t h the benefit o f hindsight, 
however, the op t ion selected enabled the Bank t o advance t h e coun try dialogue across the board.

The 2005-2008 C A S was broad ly a l igned with the pr ior i t ies ou t l ined in the fou r p i l la rs o f 
D j ibou t i 's PRSP. The C A S focused on three broad themes: (i) competitiveness and growth; (ii) 
human resources development and pover ty alleviation; and (iii) good governance. The relevance o f 
the CAS outcomes to the longer t e r m strategic goals has n o t changed during implementation. 

7. 

In support o f the f i r s t pillar (grow th and competitiveness), IDA 'S assistance was designed t o 
help D j i b o u t i (i) re fo rm pub l ic expenditure, inc lud ing a reduc t ion o f the unsustainable share o f the 
wage b i l l ; (ii) restructure the u t i l i t i e s sector t o enhance competitiveness and imp rove access o f the 
poor; and (iii) develop the transport sector as a way o f enhancing the Po r t o f D j i b o u t i as an engine 
fo r g row th and employment. In the area o f human resource development, the C A S argued f o r 
continuation o f the support t o (i) improved school access and qua l i ty o f education; (ii) emp loymen t 
generation through commun i ty development schemes; (iii) vulnerable groups w h o are v ic t ims o f 
natural catastrophes ( f lood in particular); and (iv) advancing key soc ia l i s s u e s (gender equa l i ty and

f igh t against female genital mu t i la t ion and the abuse o f Qat - a stimulant). T o promo te good 
governance, t h e CAS indicated that i t wou ld support imp lemen ta t ion o f t h e ac t ion plans proposed 
by the Coun t ry F inanc ia l Accoun tab i l i ty Assessment (CFAA ) and the Coun try Procurement 
Assessmen t Repor t (CPAR) - bo th completed in 2004 - and agreed upon with the authorities. 

111. CAS Outcomes 

CAS Theme 1: Improving competitiveness, growth and income distribution 

8. 
Under this broad CAS objective, three actions were envisaged. Crea t ing f isca l space to 
expand p r i o r i t y pub l ic services was to be achieved through reduc ing the share o f the pub l ic wage 
b i l l in to ta l expenditure and recruiting add i t iona l pub l ic service professionals at the expense o f 
administrative and security personnel. The ma in instrument fo r this outcome was the po l icy 
dialogue through the preparation and discussion o f a Coun t ry Econom ic Memorandum (CEM ) and 
o f the Pub l ic Expenditure Rev iew (PER). B o t h t h e C E M and the PER were completed in 2006. The 
C E M made fo rce fu l ly the case that, in the absence o f re forms aimed at reduc ing the high p roduc t ion 
costs and addressing the pauc i ty o f skilled workers, D j i b o u t i wou ld rema in locked in a trap o f s low 
growth, high pover ty and high unemployment. I t stressed that r e n t s derived f r om D j i b o u t i strategic 
loca t ion (military revenues, fore ign a id and po r t receipts) were channeled through the government 
budget and captured by the c i v i l service e l i t e in the f o rm o f high wages and fringe bene f i ts . 

9. 
The second action proposed in the CAS was the restructuring o f high cost u t i l i t i e s , t o 
improve the competitiveness o f the economy and access o f the poor t o basic services. Average 
ta r i f fs fo r e lec tr ic i ty and water at US$0.20/kWh (US$26/kWh fo r industries) and U S $ I . l / m 3 
respectively were among the highest in the reg ion . These high t a r i f f s were t h e resu l t o f reliance o n 
cos t ly impo r ted diesel, high ne twork losses, overs ta f f ing and h i g h taxation. The C A S proposed a 
dua l power and water pro jec t and a GEF grant fo r renewable and energy e f f ic iency . 

10. A power pro jec t was approved in Ju ly 2005. I t s objectives were t o increase access o f the poo r 
t o e lec tr ic i ty through expansion o f distribution, testing the feas ib i l i ty o f using wind energy and 
imp rov ing t h e performance o f the utility through techn ica l assistance. The wind component was 
eventually abandoned, however, because o f delays in procurement and increased cost o f equipment 
due t o fast g row ing w o r l d demand. The pro jec t was restructured in 2008 t o help the utility meet a 
hugely increased b i l l fo r impor ted d iese l o i l . In terconnec t ion with E th iop ia and the development o f 
geothermal energy with I F C support are expected t o lowe r the cost o f e lec tr ic i ty in the medium- 
t e r m . The ine f f ic ienc ies in the management o f the utility rema in to be fo rce fu l ly addressed, 
however. The water component o f the pro jec t was abandoned, as the European U n i o n agreed t o 
p rov ide assistance to the sector. 

11. The third ac t ion proposed in the C A S t o support the Po r t o f D j i b o u t i as the m a i n engine o f 
economic g row th and employment generation was the development and rehab i l i ta t ion o f the 
transport infrastructure. Over the past decade, the po r t ac t iv i ty increased considerably, as a r e s u l t o f 
(i) changing t ra f f ic patterns fo l low ing the E th iop ia-Er i trea war in 1997; (ii) the government 
decision t o transfer the management o f the po r t to Duba i Por t In terna t iona l (DPI) in 2000; and (iii) 
the rehab i l i ta t ion o f the road link to Ethiopia, with Bank support. The C A S proposed t o support the 
p r iva t iza t ion o f the D j ibou t i -E th iop ia r a i l link through the p rov is ion o f a pa r t ia l IDA guarantee fo r a 
concession scheme. N o progress has been made in that respect, however, as the selection o f a 
pr iva te operator dragged on and was no t successful. The C A S mentioned also that a transport sector 
rev iew was being carried out. The study, issued in April 2004, made techn ica l recommendations on 
h o w t o imp rove the ro le and e f f ic iency o f the Por t o f D j ibou t i .

12. Outcome 1 (growth): Increase average annual GDP g row th to 4.5 percent in 2008. 
Achieved. G row th accelerated t o 4.8 percent in 2006 and 5.3 in 2007. Sus ta inab i l i ty o f tha t 
outcome i s dependent on continued a t trac t ion o f fore ign investment through reduc t ion o f fac tor 
cost, f isca l s tab i l i ty and upgrading manpower s k i l l s , however. 

13. Outcome 2 (fiscal stability): Imp rove f isca l s tab i l i ty by ma in ta in ing t h e f isca l de f ic i t t o l e s s 
than 2 percent o f GDP. N o t achieved. F isca l po l icy was expansionary in 2006 and 2007. Tax 
revenue to GDP remained stable at about 20 percent, but expenditure increased by about 2 
percentage po in ts o f GDP f rom 2005 t o 2007. The sharp o i l and food pr ices increases in 2008 
underscored the vu lnerab i l i ty o f the budget t o external factors. 
14. Outcome 3 (debt sustainability): Ma in ta in external debt within sustainable limits. Not 
achieved. A debt sustainability analysis was conducted by the IMF and W o r l d Bank s ta f f in 2008. 
A lmos t a l l bo r row ing i s f r om o f f i c i a l lenders, and most o f it i s concessional. The analysis 
concluded, however, that the country’s risk o f debt distress i s high. D j ibou t i ’s ra t io o f n e t present 
value (NPV) debt-to-GDP ra t io i s expected to rema in we l l above the threshold o f 30 percent fo r 
countries rated as “poor performers” (according t o the Coun try Performance and Ins t i tu t iona l 
Assessmen t - CP IA ) over the next 20 years. D j i b o u t i has also incurred external arrears in past 
years. 

15. Outcome 4 (cost o f factors): reduce the cost o f factors by addressing high labor cost and 
skill shortages, issue a new labor code, and restructure u t i l i t i e s to restore f inanc ia l v i a b i l i t y and 
reduce t a r i f f s . N o t achieved. The C A S men t ioned that the wage b i l l absorbed about 15 percent o f 
GDP and h a l f o f budget expenditures. During the CAS period, these percentages dec l ined slightly 
to 14.6 percent and 49.6 percent respectively in 2007. A phys ica l audit o f the c i v i l service was 
completed and a single registry o f c i v i l servants was established in 2007. These instruments shou ld 
help with the restructuring o f the c i v i l service in l ine with development pr ior i t ies . Under a high case 
scenario, a second f isca l conso l ida t ion cred i t was envisaged. Such cred i t was n o t extended, 
however, as D j i b o u t i did no t mee t the c r i te r ia fo r mov ing t o high case. A new labor code was 
adopted in December 2005, but i s s t i l l n o t e f fec t ive fo r lack o f implementing decrees. The f inanc ia l 
v iab i l i t y o f u t i l i t ies has no t been restored and t a r i f f s have n o t been reduced. 

CAS Theme 2: Human resource development and poverty alleviation 

16. 
In support o f this broad objective, the CAS proposed the con t inua t ion o f programs f o r 
education improvement, employment generation in poor neighborhoods, and rehab i l i ta t ion o f 
infrastructure in poor areas devastated by f loods in 2004. A second phase o f an Adaptable Program 
Lending (APL ) fo r education was approved in 2005, to imp rove access to, and the qua l i ty and 
e f f ic iency o f p r ima ry education. The D j i b o u t i Urban Pover ty Reduc t ion Project, a second phase o f 
an APL , was approved in April 2008 t o increase access t o and use o f loca l infrastructure and basic 
urban services, commun i ty development and m icro- f inance by the poor segments o f the popu la t ion 
o f D j i b o u t i and secondary centers. F o l l ow i n g devastating floods, wh ich exposed the vu lnerab i l i t ies 
o f a large number o f poor families, an Emergency F loods Rehab i l i ta t ion pro jec t was approved in 
September 2004, with additional f inanc ing in February 2007. 

17. Outcome 5 (education): Increase (i) gross enrollment ra t io (GER) t o 73 percent in 2008, (ii) 
ra t io o f g ir ls t o to ta l student popu la t ion f r om 44 percent in 2003 t o 48 percent in 2008; and (iii) 
student 6-11 o l d comp le t ing p r ima ry schoo l ing f rom 55 percent in 2003 to 80 percent in 2008. 
Pa r t ia l lv achieved. The Gross Enro l lmen t Rate (GER) increased f rom 52 percent in 2005 t o 68 
percent in ea r ly 2008, inc lud ing f o r girls, and the p r ima ry repe t i t ion rate was reduced f r om over 10 

36 

percent in 2005 to 4 pe rcen t in 2008. Comp le t ion rates have deteriorated in the last school year, 
however, as a r e s u l t o f the decision to shorten the p r ima ry cyc le f r om 6 t o 5 years. Good progress 
has been made in the development o f school management committees, w h i c h i s helping t o improve 
resu l ts . Further expansion o f the education system may no t be sustainable, however, in the absence 
o f a reduction o f teachers’ wages and a be t te r a l loca t ion o f resources in the education budget in 
favor o f the poor. 

18. Outcome 6 (health): Reduce in fan t mo r ta l i ty rate (IMR) t o 85 pe r 1000 l ive births and 
maternal mo r ta l i ty rate (h4MR) to 570 per 1000,000 live births in 2006; and ensure that at least 80 
percent o f the popu la t ion i s aware o f at least 3 measures t o prevent transmission o f HIV/AIDS. 
Achieved. In the hea l th sector, the ongo ing pro jec t helped increase the p ropo r t ion o f birth in health 
facilities, f r om 40 percent in 2002 t o 93 percent in 2008 and the vacc ina t ion rate o f ch i ldren 12-23 
months f rom 45 percent to 71 percent during the same period. The reduc t ion in the IMR was 
stronger than expected. N o in fo rma t ion i s available on MMR, however. The ongo ing HIV/AIDS 
pro jec t reported a decline in HIV prevalence rate among 15-24 year o l d pregnant women f r om 2.7 
percent in 2002 to 2.1 percent at end 2007 and among sexually transm i t ted diseases (STD) patients 
f r om 22 percent t o 12.6 percent du r ing the same period. N o in fo rma t ion was p rov ided on the 
population’s awareness on HIV preven t ion in imp lemen ta t ion status reports (ISRs), however. 

19. Outcome 7 (employment and social protection): Deve lop h igh- labor intensive pub l ic 
works in support o f t h e rehab i l i ta t ion o f basic services and commun i ty development. Par t ia l ly 
achieved. The I C R fo r the f i r s t phase o f the social development and pub l ic wo rks pro jec t was issued 
in Ma r ch 2008. I t ind ica ted that access t o basic economic and social infrastructure has been 
improved in 21 poor neighborhoods, but on ly 8,300 person-months o f w o r k was created compared 
t o the target o f 17,500, wh ich was deemed unrealistic, however. The capacity o f the implementing 
agency has been strengthened. F rom available documentation, t h e number o f poor res iden ts 
bene f i t t ing f r om the pro jec t i s no t w e l l established, however, and i t i s d i f f i c u l t t o assess the 
e f f ic iency o f the operation because there was no economic analysis o f sub-projects. The flood 
emergency rehab i l i ta t ion project, c los ing in FY09, has so 
far helped rehabilitate social 
infrastructure destroyed by the 2004 floods, r e s e t t l e 360 families, and set-up an executive 
secretariat fo r disaster management. 

, 

20. 
W i t h i n the framework o f a pover ty assessment, an analysis o f the social and economic 
imp l ica t ions o f Qat impo r t and consumption at the household and macro leve l was t o be carr ied out. 
Given Bank limited resources, however, focus was put o n ra is ing awareness through h igh - leve l 
country dialogue. In February 2008, the Qat i s s u e was discussed between the President o f D j i b o u t i 
and the MNA V ice President. In Ju ly 2008, the Government launched a pub l ic campaign aimed at 
sensitizing the popu la t ion about the negative consequences o f Qat consump t ion (d is tor t ion o f 
household expenditure, loss o f wo rk ing time and reduced economic produc t iv i ty) . The campaign 
received much p ress attention and triggered pub l ic debate, in par t icu lar as i t equated t h e health and 
economic risk o f Qat consumption with those o f tobacco and alcohol. 

CAS Theme 3: Promoting good governance 

21. 
Tw o IDF grants were extended in September 2005 t o build capacity, the f i r s t one fo r 
US$0.36 m i l l i o n in pub l ic procurement reform, and the second one f o r U S 0 . 3 4 m i l l i o n in the 
Ministry o f Finance. Under the f i r s t project, a new pub l ic procurement code has been prepared, but 
has no t yet been adopted. With support f r om the second one, budget preparation has improved, but 
add i t iona l wo rk i s needed t o better integrate the investment and current budgets within a medium- 
t e r m framework and invo lve l i n e ministries in budget preparation and implementation. In sp i te o f 

37 

training, 
in terna l and external f inanc ia l con tro ls are s t i l l weak. Good progress was made in 
budgetary discipline, inc lud ing a reduction in domestic arrears. 

22. Outcome 8: Imp rove economic governance through e f f ic ien t and transparent procurement 
and t ra in ing o f s ta f f o n new customs in fo rma t ion management tools. N o t achieved. Procurement 
under Bank- f inanced pro jec t has marg ina l ly improved, but no t in country systems. There was no 
improvement in customs’ use o f modern management tools. 

23. Outcome 9 : Imp rove pub l ic finance management (budget preparation, rea l ism o f budget and 
consistency with medium-term economic framework and PRSP, in terna l and external controls, 
parliamentary oversight, cash management and e f f ic iency o f ex ante controls). Pa r t ia l ly achieved. 
The Budget D irec tora te has been strengthened. I t s capacity t o forecast revenues has been imp roved 
and i t has acquired new too ls to be t ter mon i to r budget implementation. F inanc ia l con tro ls have been 
enhanced through capacity building o f the General Inspectorate o f Finance (IGF), inc lud ing 
preparation o f a manua l o f procedures and a w o r k program, and a better d iv is ion o f labor b e tw e e n 
con tro l institutions, IGF, General State Inspectorate and the Chamber o f Accounts. 

Overall Assessment 

24. 
Imp lemen ta t ion o f the assistance program has con tr ibu ted t o imp rov ing social indicators, but 
has no t done much to address the competitiveness agenda and governance issues, two areas where 
the Government was no t strongly comm i t ted t o reforms. D u r i n g the C A S period, fo re ign d irec t 
investment increased steadily, f r om US$59 m i l l i o n in 2005 t o US$197 m i l l i o n in 2007, mos t ly f r om 
A rab sources. This surge contributed to the strategy o f the Government t o trans form D j i b o u t i in to a 
reg iona l trade and services hub, but i t might have weakened i t s resolve t o undertake d i f f i c u l t 
reforms. Also, expectations that A rab o i l producers w o u l d p rov ide pe tro leum products at be low 
w o r l d market prices gave the authorities a false sense o f security. When o i l prices hit an a l l t ime 
high in mid-2008, they had no other op t ion than to reques t the Bank to he lp pay the b i l l s o f the 

power utility. 

25. The assistance program was appropriate. I t helped D j i b o u t i move t o a second generation 
PRSP and be t ter focus on pover ty reduc t ion issues . Some steps have been taken to start the process 
o f c i v i l service reform, wh ich i s essential fo r mak ing the budget more pro-poor over t ime . 
Insu f f ic ien t attention was g iven to addressing the competitiveness agenda, however. The CEM 
focused sharply on that issue, but l i t t l e has been done in the lending program t o lowe r costs o f 
factors o r improve the s k i l l s o f the labor force. The power pro jec t cou ld have been an oppor tun i ty 
to help D j i b o u t i restructure i t s utility, but i t s ma in emphasis was o n extending d is tr ibu t ion , n o t 
reduc ing extremely high costs. In the education sector, no attempt was made to adjust teachers’ 
salaries. Ach iev ing un iversa l p r ima ry education i s simply not feasible when the average salary o f a 
c i v i l servant i s 10 t imes the average income per capita. 

IV. Bank Performance 

Quality o f Products and Services 

26. The CAS was implemented under the base case scenario o f about US$31.4 million o f 

I D A credits. During FY05-08, 4 out o f 5 operations planned under the base case scenario were 
delivered, fo r US$28.5 m i l l ion , o f which US$5 .1 m i l l i o n in grants. These inc luded the f l o o d 
emergency and rehab i l i ta t ion pro jec t and i t s add i t iona l financing, the power p ro jec t (approved 
w i thou t the water component), the second phase o f t h e school access and improvement, and the 
urban pover ty reduc t ion project. In addition, the Bank showed flexibility in he lp ing D j i b o u t i 

3 8 

address the 2008 food and o i l crises, by extending a grant t o compensate the loss o f tax revenues 
when the Government removed the consumption tax on key food staples, and by res truc tur ing the 
power pro jec t t o finance the power utility's o i l bill. 

27. The Bank raised resources to complement I D A funding. During the C A S period, the Bank 
made extensive use o f IDF grants and similar fac i l i t ies . Bes ides the two grants men t ioned above f o r 
imp rov ing procurement and pub l ic finance management, the Bank approved (i) a US$0.25 m i l l i o n 
grant under t h e t r u s t fund fo r statistical capacity building t o support the Statistics O f f i c e in February 
2006, (ii) a US$6 m i l l i o n grant under the Educa t ion fo r a l l - Fast track in i t ia t ive (EFA-FTI) 
Ca ta ly t ic Trust Fund in M a y 2006, (iii) a US$2 .1 m i l l i o n grant under the A v i a n and Human 
In f luenza (AHI) Fac i l i t y in October 2006, (iv) a US$0 .24 m i l l i o n IDF grant to help the Government 
streamline i t s pension system in August 2007, and (v) a U S 0 . 2 9 m i l l i o n IDF grant t o help the 
Government establish an e f fec t ive M&E system f o r the MDS in April 2008. Ac t iv i t ies under these 
grants are s t i l l ongoing. W h i l e satisfactory progress was made in education and A v i a n flu, delays 
were encountered in statistics and pension re form . 

28. The CAS design was adequate. Building on progress made under the prev ious CAS, it 
supported imp lemen ta t ion o f key objectives o f the f i r s t PRSP. D u r i n g the consu l ta t ion process fo r 
preparation o f the CAS, the Government and the Bank selected the op t ion o f cover ing several areas 
o f the PRSP, instead o f focusing on one o f the fou r p i l lars . The expected benefit o f the approach 
was to use Bank invo lvemen t as a catalyst fo r increased donor assistance in support o f the PRSP. 
This approach was successful in the urban pover ty reduc t ion program (para l le l f inanc ing by the 
A f r i can Development Bank, the Is lam ic Deve lopmen t Bank and o f the Agence F r a n p i s e de 
De'veloppement), and in the education sector (additional f inanc ing f rom the ca ta ly t ic fund f o r 
education fo r all). The mix o f instruments t o achieve the CAS objectives was also adequate. 

29. However, the Bank work was no t always sequenced properly. During C A S 
implementation, while the economic and sector w o r k focused on h ow to move on the g row th and 
competitiveness agenda (CEM) and to increase pro-poor expenditures (PER), the lend ing p rog ram 
became exc lus ive ly concerned with imp rov ing social indicators and services. The power project, 
wh i ch the CAS envisaged as a means to he lp D j i b o u t i restructure i t s loss mak ing utility, was 
eventually designed as an instrument to extend services to the poor. N o rea l e f fo r t was made t o 
address the basic problems o f the bankrupt utility, however. In addition, the proposed IDA pa r t ia l 
risk guarantee t o support a concession scheme f o r the D j ibou t i -E th iop ia ra i lway cou ld n o t be 
activated because o f the comp lex i ty o f finding appropriate solutions in a reg iona l context. In the 
education sector, the second phase o f the APL was prepared before the PER was issued. 
Accord ing ly , i t did no t benefit f r om the analysis o f pub l ic expenditure issues in the education 
sector. It was clear, however, that expansion o f the system was f isca l ly unsustainable. I t w o u l d have 
been highly advisable to reach agreement with the Government on a medium-term expenditure 
program fo r the sector. 

30. The performance o f the Bank i s rated as moderately satisfactory. The ana ly t ica l w o r k 
was good. As discussed above, in designing i t s operations, par t icu lar ly in the powe r and education 
sector, the Bank did no t t r y with su f f ic ien t v igo r t o reach agreement with the Government on cost 
reduc t ion and sustainability, however. Po r t fo l io management was fully adequate. 

Portfolio Assessment 

3 1. Overall implementation o f the portfolio during the CAS period has been satisfactory (6 
projects) with on ly one prob lem pro jec t during FY08 , the second school access and improvemen t 
project, with flags in mon i to r ing and evaluation, and disbursement. However, a l l pro jec ts start with 

39 

tw o flags, the country record and coun try environment flags2 wh ich are au toma t ica l ly raised fo r a l l 
projects in D j ibou t i . Disbursement ra t io fo r the e n t i r e po r t fo l io has been stable over the C A S 
period, with a ra t io higher than 33 percent. 

32. A Coun try Po r t fo l io Performance Review (CPPR) carr ied ou t in June 2008 no ted tha t 
supervision o f the po r t fo l io was focused on resu l ts , but was hampered in i t s e f for ts by the l im i t e d 
capacity fo r M&E in D j ibou t i . I s s u e s were brought to the attention o f management and addressed 
expeditiously. The safeguards and f iduc ia ry aspects were adequately mon i tored . Bank teams 
prov ided strong support t o pro jec t imp lemen ta t ion units, pa r t icu la r ly as concerns procurement and 
f inanc ia l management issues .

IEG Eva luat ion o f IC&. During the C A S pe r iod the Independent Eva lua t ion G roup (IEG)

Pub l ic Works, t h e In terna t iona l Road Co r r ido r Project, and the f i r s t phase o f t h e Educa t ion A P L . 
The I C R fo r the Social Deve lopmen t and Pub l ic Works received a moderately satisfactory ra t ing o n 
outcome. For lessons learned, IEG stated that there i s a need t o prepare pro jec ts with rea l is t ic 
targets and timetables, with associated r i s k s flagged up front. Imp lemen ta t ion in clear phases w o u l d 
fac i l i ta te r e s u l t s at a reasonable pace while consolidating support fo r the pro jec t . Pro jec t preparation 
should be thorough, but envisage a flexible pro jec t design t o adapt t o the development pace o f the 
country, and in th is case the evo lu t ion o f the executing agency. Close support and intense 
supervision i s requ ired fo r projects in countries with l o w imp lemen ta t ion capacity t o ensure tha t 
problems are iden t i f ied early on and that solutions are put in place and fo l lowed up.” 

34. The I C R fo r the first phase o f the Educa t ion A P L was issued in December 2005. I t was 
reviewed by IEG in February 2006. IEG concurred with the ICR ’s ra t ings (satisfactory fo r outcome, 
substantial fo r ins t i tu t iona l development and highly likely f o r sustainability). K e y lessons f r om 
experience are: broad consultation i s essential in ensuring success, A P L i s a good instrument f o r 

To date, the flag for the country environment records risk remains permanently raised in the portfolio 
management system, because the CPIA rating has b e e n historically low, and, despite recen t economic 
management improvement, the rating remains below 3.5. Similarly, t h e country record flag remains raised, 
following a net disconnect o f 20 percent between the outcome IEG rating and the ISR rating for projects 
evaluated between FY2002 and FY2006.

long-term commitment, and Bank supervision needs t o pay more attention t o mon i to r ing and 
evaluation. 

35 . 
Fo r the In terna t iona l Road Co r r ido r project, which financed the rehab i l i ta t ion o f the road and 
associated service infrastructure f rom the po r t t o the E th iop ian border, IEG concluded that the 
pro jec t achieved i t s objectives, and the outcome was rated satisfactory. T rave l time f r om the po r t t o 
the border has been reduced f rom be tween 6 t o 10 hours t o l e s s than three hours and transport cost 
have been reduced by 60 percent. T ra f f ic increased faster than expected. The in terna l rate o f return 
at 42 percent was higher than estimated at appraisal. IEG also reviewed the I C R fo r a G l o b a l 
Env ironmen t Fund (GEF) grant fo r the f inanc ing o f a reg iona l pro jec t t o imp rove coastal and 
marine environments o f the Red Sea and G o l f o f Aden. The outcome o f the pro jec t was rated as 
satisfactory. 

Cost o f CAS implementation 

36. Average pro jec t preparation costs, exc lud ing add i t iona l financing, in the C A S pe r iod were 
re la t ive ly l o w (at US$240,000 / US$283,000 when P H R D g r a n t s are included). In comparison, the 
average preparation costs exc lud ing add i t iona l f inanc ing were US$472,000 (US$5 57,000 when 
PHRD are included) in Yemen over the same pe r iod (FY05-08). However, it w i l l be no ted that the 
preparation cost amounts to US$306,000 in F Y 0 8 . This amount i s s t i l l t h e lowes t f o r the reg ion . 
Fo r the ESW, the average comp le t ion cost was US$89,000 over FY05-08, and was be low the 
reg iona l average (US$l25,000) fo r FY06 .

37. The country dialogue was adequate. The Government was helpful in addressing p ro jec t 
implementation issues as they arose. I t was less inc l ined t o take appropriate measures t o reduce 
costs in the p rov is ion o f pub l ic services. The i s s u e s raised in t h e C E M and PER shou ld have b e e n 
brough t to the fore more force fu l ly , but this was no t an easy task, as the D j ibou t ian authorities did 
no t f e e l the urge t o introduce d i f f icu l t reforms during a pe r iod marked by a fast increase in the flow 
o f pr iva te investment. During the CAS pe r iod fore ign d irec t 
investment dwa r fed IDA 
disbursements. 

38. The Bank worked effectively with its development partners. The donor commun i ty i s 
par t icu lar ly sma l l in D j ibou t i , and the Bank does n o t have an o f f ice there. Close coord ina t ion with 

41 

donors was maintained by Bank missions during the CAS period, however. As men t ioned above, 
the Ban k was able to develop a mu l t i -dono r program fo r urban pover ty reduc t ion with the A f r i c a n 
Development Bank and the Is lam ic Deve lopmen t Bank. The t h r e e ins t i tu t ions have operated within 
a common framework and coordinated with a new pro jec t financed by the Agence F ranCa ise p o u r 
l e De 've loppemen t (AFD) in the same domain, each however establishing a separate and para l le l co- 
f inanc ing agreement with the Government. In total, the Bank U S $ 3 m i l l i o n were substantially 
leveraged t o a to ta l o f $38.5 m i l l i o n that i s he lp ing cover infrastructure needs in the poorest 
neighborhoods o f D j ibou t i -v i l le and in f i v e secondary centers. 

Lessons learned 

39. Manag ing tensions among d i f feren t ethnic groups and b e tw e e n loca l popu la t ion and a large 
number o f imm igran ts f rom unstable ne ighbor ing countries invo lves a delicate ba lanc ing act. A f t e r 
the los t decade o f the 1990s due to c i v i l s t r i f e and deepening poverty, t h e Government has been 
able t o restore po l i t ica l s tab i l i ty and economic grow th . Progress was made also in imp rov ing soc ia l 
indicators. This i s a ma jor achievement. I t i s impor tan t n o w f o r the Government t o build up o n 
success achieved to address key issues, wh ich may stand in the way o f sus ta ined economic g row th 
and pover ty reduction. 

40. The Bank assistance program helped D j i b o u t i make rap id progress on soc ia l indicators, but 
had l i t t le i n f l u e n c e on the g row th and governance agenda. Building upon success achieved, it i s 
impor tan t n ow t o consolidate r e s u l t s and help D j i b o u t i achieve i t s v is ion o f a service hub in 
be tween the A rab w o r l d and the Eastern A f r i c a Region. The vu lnerab i l i t ies exposed during the food 
and o i l crises o f 2008 should s e r v e as a basis fo r deepening the po l icy dialogue b e tw e e n D j i b o u t i 
and the Bank . 

41. Consultations with the Government fo r t h e preparation o f the new C A S shou ld be centered 
on h o w t o improve competitiveness and ensure that improvements in the p rov is ion o f soc ia l 
services are sustainable. The new CAS shou ld be highly selective and focus o n enhancing 
competitiveness and imp rov ing t h e p rov is ion o f basic services in a sustainable way .
