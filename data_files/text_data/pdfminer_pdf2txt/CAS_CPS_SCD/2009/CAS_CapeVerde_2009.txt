EXECUT IVE SUMMARY 

1. 

ii. 

Background. This FY09-12 Country Partnership Strategy for Cape Verde sets out the proposed 
financial and technical support o f the World Bank Group in line with development priorities established 
by the country’s Authorities in their Second Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper for 2008-1 1. 
Since Cape Verde graduated to Middle Income Country status in January 2008, this w i l l be the first Bank 
strategy that treats Cape Verde as an IBRD-IDA blend country. 
Country Context. Cape Verde i s a small archipelago with a stable democratic system. I t 
achieved annual real economic growth o f seven percent per year during the 2004-07 period, to reach a 
GNI per capita estimated a t US$2,380 for 2008, and reduced poverty by 10 percentage points to 27 
percent, due largely to strong economic management. Nonetheless, the economic slowdown in Europe 
affected economic performance in Cape Verde in the second h a l f o f 2008, due to a decline in foreign 
direct investment, tourism and remittances flows that impacted negatively on Cape Verde’s growth. The 
medium-term outlook i s subject to a number o f further significant downside risks. The f i s c a l position 
could be undermined i f the financial situation o f Electra, the electricity and water utility, does not 
improve and i f large public investments programs are not well managed. Cape Verde’s strong track record 
o f macroeconomic management and solid s truc tura l reforms augur well fo r i t s willingness to take prompt 
and difficult decisions that help mitigate the effects o f the current global financial turmoil. 
iii. Country Priorities. Cape Verde’s overarching vision i s to achieve economic transformation 
based on its geo-strategic, natural and cultural assets, notably as a hub for transshipment, offshore 
f inanc ia l and other services and tourism. These priorities are the foundation for i t s GPRSP-I1 fo r 
2008-1 1, which focuses on the following five pillars: public sector governance; human capital 
development; competitiveness; infrastructure; and soc ia l cohesion. Cape Verde has set ambitious goals to 
boost economic growth and reduce unemployment under the GPRSP-I1 that w i l l be hampered by the 
global financial cr is is , given the country’s vulnerability to decreases in tourism, remittances and foreign 
direct investment. 
iv. 
Bank Program and Instruments. The Bank’s overarching objective for this CPS i s to help the 
Government sustain high levels o f growth and reduce unemployment, poverty and inequality. The 
proposed Bank strategy aims to provide selective, demand-driven assistance that deepens the Cape Verde- 
Bank partnership in th ree key areas that constitute the pillars o f the CPS: (1) promoting good governance 
and public sector capacity; (2) improving competitiveness and the investment climate fo r private sector- 
led growth; and (3) strengthening human capital and soc ia l inclusion. Moreover, in the same way as Cape 
Verde i s pursuing a broader transformation agenda, the World Bank Group aims to transform its 
relationship with Cape Verde over the period o f the Strategy. This w i l l involve a much broader menu o f 
financial and technical support than in the past, ranging from the ongoing IDA, AAA and trust fund 
support to include IBRD lending; an expanded IFC program; MIGA and IBRD guarantees; new hedging 
products; specialized technical assistance, for example on debt management; and facilitation o f South- 
South Exchanges. 
v. 
The Bank w i l l concentrate its financial resources in selected areas within the three pillars o f the 
CPS so as to achieve transformative change. This implies focusing resources in a sector over time until a 
transformation point i s reached beyond which the sector i s elevated irreversibly to a higher functioning 
level. For example, the fu l l IBRD envelope o f US$52 .8 million w i l l be assigned to the critical energy 
sector and build on previous assistance in that sector in order to support decisive change. The PRSC 
ser ies o f around US$10 million per year over four years w i l l focus on governance and competitiveness 
reforms and build on the previous PRSCs and the ongoing Growth and Competitiveness operation in 
order to reinforce this priority area. New IDA-and GEF-financed investment projects totaling US$13 
million over the next four years w i l l also address governance and competitiveness reforms, as well as 
bolster support through the ongoing Road Sector operation so as to achieve transformative change via 
continuing and enhanced support to the transport sector. The program o f lending w i l l moreover seek to 

v i i 

promote social inclusion even as i t supports higher growth and efficiency. I t builds on an existing, well- 
performing portfolio o f three operations totaling US$48 .5 million that i s well-aligned with the CPS 
objectives. Non-lending support during the CPS period w i l l cover core diagnostics and include policy 
notes that provide flexible and rapid responses to Government on key issues. Capacity enhancement w i l l 
be an integral part o f Bank support and to this end, the Strategy w i l l draw on trust fund resources and 
specialized skills within the Bank. The Bank’s program w i l l also continue to be coordinated closely with 
donor partners, notably partners in the Budget Support Group that engages in joint policy dialogue with 
Government on budget support. 
vi. 
IFC and M IGA . The Strategy provides a framework for the participation o f IFC and MIGA, 
especially to support the development o f private participation in infrastructure. IFC’s current investment 
portfolio in Cape Verde i s limited, with a to ta l o f U S $ 8 million in investments in the telecommunications 
and banking sectors. Looking ahead, IFC w i l l focus on opportunities to improve financing options for 
SMEs in Cape Verde, and public-private in fras truc ture projects, notably in telecommunications. IFC’s 
PEP-Africa program, in coordination with IDA, has prepared studies on key sectors for the economic 
transformation agenda. MIGA does not have any exposure in Cape Verde at present, but i s prepared to 
provide guarantees for private sector-led investments in infrastructure as well as technical assistance on 
structuring sustainable public-private partnerships. 
vii. 
R i s k s . The first main risk relates to the medium-term e f f e c t s on Cape Verde o f the ongoing 
international financial c r i s i s and the global economic slowdown. Cape Verde i s highly exposed to 
external risks in light o f i t s open economy and i t s dependence on tourism receipts, remittances, donors 
financing and fore ign direct investment. The difficulty in predicting a turnaround in the global context 
heightens these risks further and makes it difficult to gauge the amplitude and duration o f adverse e f fec ts . 
A preliminary sensitivity analysis indicates that adverse external shocks would have more negative effects 
on growth than on f isca l and external balances, due to self-stabilizing features in these accounts. Factors 
that mitigate the risks related to the global c r i s i s include Cape Verde’s build-up o f sizable international 
reserves in recent years; i t s standing line o f credit with the Central Bank o f Portugal; i t s continued 
monitoring under the IMF PSI, i t s access to budget support from the Budget Support Group o f donors, 
including the Bank, and the country’s solid track record o f proactive economic management and timely 
adjustment to shocks. The forthcoming Poverty Assessment w i l l simulate the poverty impact o f potential 
shocks across different groups so as to identify additional mitigation measures for vulnerable groups. I f 
unpredictable negative developments warrant it, an early CPS Progress Report i s envisaged so as to 
ensure flexibility and timely adjustments in the Bank’s response. The second main risk i s that the next 
Presidential elections w i l l take place early in 201 1 and the timing o f more difficult institutional reforms 
w i l l need to take this into consideration. The third main risk i s that the Government faces a range o f 
contingent liabilities related to public or semi-public companies either not operating efficiently or being 
affected by the economic downturn. The Bank w i l l provide support that directly addresses the financial 
position o f t h e most prominent o f these risks, namely Electra. A fourth risk i s that shortcomings in 
administrative capacity could a f fec t the implementation o f the GPRSP-I1 and reforms supported by the 
Strategy. To this end, the Bank and other donors are financing a combination o f capacity-building 
activities and technical support. The fifth main risk i s that, with Cape Verde’s graduation to M I C s ta tus 
in January 2008, donors may begin to withdraw concessional aid at a faster pace than foreseen. The Bank 
w i l l seek to moderate this risk by supporting Cape Verde’s continued access to concessional financing as 
an IDNIBRD blend country and by encouraging donor partners to do the same. 
viii. 
I n i t s discussion o f the CPS, the Board may wish to consider the following issues: 
Does the CPS adequately address key development priorities for Cape Verde? 
Does the CPS adequately address risks, notably in the context o f the global economic slowdown? 
I s the policy, institutional and results framework underpinning the CPS appropriate?

I. INTRODUCT ION 

1. 

This Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY09-12 sets out the proposed financial and 
technical support o f the World Bank Group (WBG) in line with development priorities established 
by Cape Verde’s Authorities. Cape Verde’s overarching v is ion i s that o f achieving economic 
trans forma t ion on the basis o f i t s geo-strategic, natural and cu l tura l assets, no tab ly as a hub for 
transshipment, offshore f inanc ia l and other services and tourism. These pr ior i t ies are the foundation fo r 
i t s Second G row th and Poverty Reduc t ion Strategy Paper (GPRSP-11) fo r 2008-201 1, wh ich focuses on 
the same f ive p i l la rs as the earlier GPRSP through 2008, namely pub l ic sector governance, human capital 
development, infrastructure, competitiveness and social cohesion. Cape Verde achieved annual rea l 
economic g row th o f seven percent and reduced pover ty by 10 percentage po in ts during the previous CAS 
pe r iod through strong economic management. I t has se t ambitious goals to boost economic g row th and 
reduce unemployment under the GPRSP-I1 that w i l l be hampered by the g loba l f inanc ia l crisis, g iven the 
country’s vu lnerab i l i ty to declines in tourism, remittances and fore ign direct investment. Supporting 
Cape Verde to ma in ta in the impetus o f reforms and consolidate i t s progress on a strong medium t e r m 
development agenda through this crisis per iod w i l l be a key challenge fo r the strategy. 

2. 

Since Cape Verde graduated to Middle Income Country (M IC ) status in January 2008, this 
will be its first Country Partnership Strategy as an IBRD - IDA blend country.’ The Bank has 
enjoyed a strong and productive wo rk ing relationship with Cape Verde and the Au thor i t ies have asked the 
Bank Group to deepen i t s partnership in three key areas that constitute the p i l la rs o f the CPS: (1) 
P romo t ing good governance and pub l ic sector capacity; ( 2 ) Imp rov ing competitiveness and the 
investment climate fo r private sector-led growth, and (3) Strengthening human cap i ta l and social 
inc lus ion . The Bank w i l l concentrate i t s f inanc ia l resources in selected areas within these p i l la rs so as to 
support Cape Verde in pursuing a broader transformation agenda. Moreover, the WBG aims at 
trans form ing i t s relationship with Cape Verde over the CPS period. This w i l l invo lve a considerably 
broader menu o f technical and f inanc ia l support than in the past, rang ing f rom the ongo ing IDA, AAA 
and t r u s t fund support to include IBRD lending; an expanded I F C program; MIGA and IBRD guarantees; 
new hedg ing products; specialized technical assistance, fo r example on debt management; and fac i l i ta t ion 
o f South-South Exchanges. This program o f support wou ld be implemented in close coord ina t ion with 
donor partners. 

11. COUNTRY CONTEXT 

2.1 GEOGRAPHICAL, HISTORICAL AND POLITICAL CONTEXT 

3 . 

Cape Verde i s a small archipelago o f ten islands located o f f the west coast o f Africa. The 
coun try has around 500,000 inhabitants and i s located some 300 miles o f f the coast o f Senegal and i s 
slightly larger than the State o f Rhode Is land with 1,557 square miles. I t s loca t ion on the geographic 
band o f the Sahel greatly influences i t s climate. Cape Verde has few natural resources’ and s u f f e r s f r om 
serious water shortages. These have been exacerbated by cycles o f long- term drough t that have 
contributed to s ign i f ican t emigration throughout Cape Verde’s history, so that i t i s be l ieved that around 
tw ice as many Cape Verdeans l i v e abroad as on the islandsm3 The Diaspora maintains close relations with 

’ As o f January 2008, Cape Verde has graduated from the UN l is t o f Least Developed Countries. The country has no t graduated 
from IDA and w i l l continue to borrow from IDA under the Small States Exception. 
The most important natural resources a r e salt, pozolan (volcanic rock used in cement production) and limestone. 
The population in Praia, the capital, i s estimated at 106,052 and in Mindelo, the second largest city, at 67,844. Some 500,000 
people o f Cape Verdean ancestry l ive in the Un i ted States, ma in ly in N ew England. Portugal, France, I ta ly , Senegal and the 
Netherlands also have large Cape Verdean communities.

the country, sending home remittances equivalent to 9.2 percent o f GDP in 2007. W i t h barely 10 percent 
o f i t s surface as arable land and with limited m inera l resources, Cape Verde’s a r id conditions and 
mountainous terrain place the country at a disadvantage fo r agr icu l tura l produc t ion and it i s a net importer 
o f food and fuel. 

4. 

Cape Verde has recorded important political gains during the last few decades and i s 
recognized as one of the most open countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. First co lon ized by Portugal in 
1456, the islands were settled by refugees fleeing po l i t ica l and re l ig ious persecution in Europe, who in 
turn brought slaves f rom the A f r ican continent and developed a mestiqo (m ixed race) culture, with 
influences f rom the cu l tura l traditions o f Europe, the M i d d l e East and Africa-this 
cu l tura l heritage has, 
fo r example, g iven r i s e to a r i c h and d is t inc t ive mus ica l trad i t ion . Cape Verde gained independence in 
1975, and fo l low ing a brief po l i t ica l un ion with Guinea-Bissau until 1980, charted i t s ow n course as a 
one-party state until constitutional reforms in 1991 brought about a peaceful trans i t ion to a mu l t i-par ty 
democracy. Since then, Cape Verde has consolidated i t s democratic ins t i tu t ions and developed a strong 
track record o f peaceful elections and transfers o f power, a f r e e and diverse press, and active c i v i l society 
and grass-roots organizations. The Pa r t ido African0 da Independ inc ia de Cab0 Verde (PAICV), wh ich 
ru led the country f rom independence in 1975 until 1991, regained power in January 2001. The P A I C V 
also obtained a new pa r l iamen tay ma jo r i ty in January 2006 and President Pedro Pires was reelected fo r a 
five-year t e rm in February 2006. W i t h the nex t presidential elections scheduled fo r February 20 1 1, there 
i s a w indow o f oppor tun i ty fo r ma jo r structural reforms in the early phase o f implementation o f the CPS 
before the country prepares fo r the nex t general elections. 

2.2 POVERTY AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS 

5 . 

Rapid growth since the early 1990s has sharply reduced poverty, although inequality 
remains high. The analysis o f the latest three pover ty surveys’ suggests that the share o f the popu la t ion 
in absolute pover ty decreased f rom 49 percent in 1988-89 to 37 percent in 2001-02 and to 27 percent in 
2007 (see Table 1). This i s an impor tan t achievement, driven by rap id g row th in rea l income per capita- 
fo r example, during the last CAS pe r iod (2005-2008) income per person rose at 5 percent per year, faster 
than in most sma l l island s ta tes o r the average fo r Sub-Saharan A f r ica . At the same time, inequa l i ty rose 
sharply during the 1990s and has remained high since then, with a Gini coe f f ic ien t fo r consumption o f 
0.49 in 2007. Progress in reduc ing pover ty has been slower in ru ra l areas, where 72 percent o f the poor 
l ive and where 30 percent o f the popu la t ion l i v e s in absolute poverty, compared to 12 percent o f the urban 
population. I t has also var ied across islands and socioeconomic groups: the islands with the largest ru ra l 
populations (Santo Antgo, Santiago, Silo N ico lau and Fogo) have experienced the highest rates o f pover ty 
and food insecurity.6 The ma jo r investments that drove the recent economic boom were concentrated on 
the island o f Sal (with i t s tour ism infrastructure), in the capital c i ty o f Praia, and in M inde lo on the island 
o f Sgo Vicente, with i t s deep water po r t and active business commun i ty . 

The most recent municipal elections in May 2008 saw the opposition M pD (Movement for Democracy) w in a narrow majority 
o f mayoral contests, including the key municipalities o f Santa Catarina, SBo Vicente, Sal and Praia. 
These comprise the 1988-89 and 2001-02 IDRF household surveys (Znqukrito d s Despensas e Receitas Fam i l iares) and the 
2007 QUIBB (Unified Survey o f Core Welfare Indicators).

Cape Verde i s on track to meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDG). W i t h sustained 
economic g row th and s ign i f ican t investments in human capital, there has been so l id progress on social 
indicators and on the ,M i l lenn ium Development Goals (see Annex B5 and Append ix 8). The country 
ranks 102 out o f 177 countries in the UNDP ’s 2007/2008 Human Development Index, wh ich i s the third- 
highest rank ing in A f r ica . Cape Verde i s on track to reach most o f the MDGs by 2015. The sharp 
reduc t ion in pover ty since 1990 has been complemented by s ign i f ican t ly increased access to education 
and health care. The net pr imary enrollment rate in elementary education rose f rom 72 percent in 1990/91 
to 95 percent in 2005/06, while net secondary enrollment reached nearly 60 percent in 2005/06. The 
l i teracy rate in Cape Verde i s 79 percent (84 percent in urban areas and 74 percent in ru ra l areas), and 
while i t s t i l l varies by gender (72 percent fo r women and 87 percent fo r men), Cape Verde has now 
achieved pa r i ty fo r girls and boys in school e n r ~ l l m e n t . ~ 
In fan t mo r ta l i ty has been reduced f rom 45 to 25 
per 1,000 live births since 1990, maternal mo r ta l i ty has also declined as births attended by sk i l led health 
personnel have r i s e n sharply f rom 54 percent in 1995 to around 90 percent, and l i f e expectancy at birth 
(71 years) i s the third highest in A f r ica . Cape Verde has made impor tan t efforts to contain the spread o f 
in fec t ious diseases. The mos t recent survey po in ts t o an HIV/AIDS prevalence rate o f 0.8 percent, versus 
0.5 percent in the mid-l990s, while the incidence o f tuberculosis has been around 165 per 100,000 since 
the early 1990s. Cape Verde has also made progress on reforestation, with the forest area rising f rom 14 
percent to s l igh t ly over 20 percent o f land area since 1990. In addition, i t has become an increasingly 
open economy, with trade rising f rom 56 to 75 percent o f GDP since 1990, in te rne t access rising f r om 
zero to 7 percent over the past decade and telephony (mob i le and fixed l ine ) experiencing an e igh t- fo ld 
increase to 40 percent since 2000. 

7. 

At the same time, Cape Verde faces important social challenges with high unemployment 
among vulnerable groups. Though the propor t ion o f the labor force unable to f i n d fo rma l wo rk f e l l

from 26 to 18 percent between 1998 and 2008, unemployment remains high, particularly among youth, 
women and ru ra l populations, and there are sharp differences across islands, reflecting a misalignment 
between skills and job opportunities and constraints in domestic migration. At the same time, 
unemployment has risen sharply among migrant workers from the African continent as construction for 
the tourism industry on the island o f Sal has stalled with the global cr is is , leading to economic hardships 
and increased petty crime.8 Moreover, among the employed population, almost one-quarter work less 
than 3 5 hours per week, and a significant share o f the economically active population, especially the poor, 
gain their livelihoods in the informal sector, where they work temporary jobs primarily in construction or 
working as street vendors. In ru ra l communities, especially during bad agricultural years, families have 
depended on temporary jobs created by the Government’s works program (known as FAIMO), which had 
now been replaced by a community-driven small works program known as Micro-realizaq6es. 
Unemployment among young people i s seen as a key contributor to social problems (e.g. increasing 
delinquency, early pregnancy, prostitution, drugs and a lcoho l abuse). 

8. 

Gender inequality i s less pronounced than elsewhere in Africa, but still needs to be 
addressed. Women in Cape Verde are likely to be poorer than men. I n urban areas they account fo r 
close to 40 percent o f non-agricultural jobs, and when employed tend to earn less than men at similar 
levels o f education and experiences. I n rural areas, they account for c lose to 50 percent o f farmers, but 
tend to farm smaller plots o f land. In the public sphere, women account for 15 percent o f the members o f 
the Legislature, while 50 percent o f the current Administration’s Cabinet Ministers are women. Women 
have experienced impressive gains in education and health, including parity in enrollments, declines in 
maternal mortality, and a decline in total fertility from 5.4 to 3.4 since 1990. I n 2005 Cape Verde ratified 
the women’s rights protocol o f the African Charter and its legal framework promotes equal rights. 
Continued challenges include reducing the incidence o f domestic violence, strengthening access to basic 
social services for female-headed households and furthering equality o f opportunity in access to jobs and 
to justice. 

2.3 RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS 

9 . 

Cape Verde has experienced robust economic growth in recent years. Real GDP averaged 7 
percent during 2004-07, peaking at 10.8 percent in 2006. The strong economic performance re f lec ts a 
major economic transformation i n the economy towards a service-based economy led by the tourism 
s e ~ t o r . ~ Growth has been driven by strong public and private investment (through significant FDI) 
directed largely towards infrastructure development, tourism, and the telecommunications industry. 
Sound monetary policy, targeted a t strengthening the peg o f the Cape Verde escudo to the euro, has been 
an important factor in maintaining price stability. Official fore ign reserves grew from 2.8 to 3.9 months 
o f imports during 2005-07, and when an interest rate misalignment with the Euribor rate contributed to a 
temporary decline in reserves, the Central Bank raised its in teres t rates by 100 basis points in October 
2008, reversing the trend in net outflows. As a result, i t i s estimated that in 2008 reserves remained at 3.9 
months o f prospective imports. Fiscal policy has also been characterized by prudence. Higher than 
expected tax collection and continued expenditure control brought the 2008 f i s c a l deficit (including 
grants) down to 1.2 percent o f GDP from a high o f 6.3 percent o f GDP in 2005. This f isca l performance 
has helped contain external and domestic debt (see Table 2 in Section 2.4), although f isca l risks persist, 
notably due to the weak performance o f the electricity utility, Electra (see Box 1 in Section 3.4).

Intent for the 5th PSI review that they intend to request an extension o f the PSI fo r at least four more 
years until 2013 (Le. a one-year extension o f the curren t PSI followed by a new 3-year PSI). 

1 1. 

The Cape Verdean economy withstood the 2008 food and fuel shocks and the initial months 
o f the global crisis relatively well, but slowed in the latter part o f the year and 2009 i s expected to be 
more difficult. Inflation rose to an estimated 6.8 percent in 2008 from 4.4 percent the previous year as a 
result o f increases in food and fuel prices that were largely passed through to consumers." The country's 
large stocks o f cereal reserves and the appreciation o f the Cape Verde escudo against the United States 
dollar in the first eight months o f 2008 somewhat mitigated inflationary pressures from rising food and 
fuel prices, so that Bank simulations o f the net impact on poverty from the shocks suggest around a one 
percent increase. Cape Verde's economy also held up relatively well in the first months o f the global 
financial cr is is , with net tourism receipts declining by l e s s than two percent in 2008 compared to 2007.'* 
Foreign direct investment rose by 9 percent in 2008, due to the strong performance in the first semester, 
but during the second half o f 2008, rea l estate investments decelerated because developers, mainly 
Europeans, faced difficulties securing long-term financing. Remittances declined by 17 percent in 2008, 
following on an ea r l ie r decline in 2007. These trends are expected to continue into 2009 (see next 
Section). 

2.4 MEDIUM TERM OUTLOOK AND SUSTAINABILITY'3 

12. 

The global financial c r i s i s means that growth projections in the GPRSP-I1 will need to be 
revised downwards. Before the global financial c r i s i s arose in la te 2008, the GPRSP-I1 was issued with 
projected growth ra tes o f around 8 percent fo r 2008-09 and double-digit growth for 2010-1 1. These rates 
were based on projections o f continued strong growth in tourism and infrastructure, but w i l l clearly need 
to be revised downwards-ven 
before the cr is is , a double-digit growth rate had occurred only in 2006, 
largely due to one-off events. The medium term outlook, revised in March 2009, points to a GDP growth 
rate o f 3-4 percent in 2009, revised downwards from a January 2009 projection o f 5 percent growth for 
the year. Revisions reflect principally the impact o f the global slowdown on tourism and foreign direct 
investment (FDI) flows-FDI 
i s expected to decline by 14 percent in 2009 and single digit declines are 
also expected in tourism and remittances in light o f the recession in the Euro zone. Growth i s projected to 
recover slightly to 4-5 percent in 2010, and then to increase to 6-6.5 percent in 2011 and 2012, 
considerably below the medium term trend observed in recent years. The eventual recovery i s expected 
to be led by private investment in tourism, public investment in infrastructure, and private con~umption.'~ 
Inflation i s projected to decline to an average o f 3.3 percent in 2009 and 2.7 percent in 2010 (see Table 2). 
The projected trend in inflation reflects an anticipated decline in commodity prices and the related easing 

The authorities introduced some measures to curtail the impact o f food and o i l price, including the elimination o f international 
trade taxes and VAT on cereals; improvements i n importation and distribution efficiency; increased amounts and coverage o f 
non-contributory pensions; investment i n new equipment to increase f u e l efficiency; creation o f a sole logistic company to handle 
imports; strengthening o f regulatory capacity, and a revised petroleum products adjustment mechanism to increase transparency. 
U t i l i ty tariffs were also raised by 5 percent in June 2008 in response to higher petroleum prices. In the medium to long term, 
Cape Verde w i l l invest i n renewable energies to reduce its dependence on o i l imports. Bank and IMF staff have moreover 
recommended building up buffers o f foreign reserves and fiscal space, and Cape Verde i s receiving TA from IMF staff to 
enhance its capacity to assess macroeconomic risks. 
'' The tourism sector i s also driving growth i n other sectors, such as construction, retail, transportation, agribusinesslfishing, 
The true shortfall as a result o f the c r is is i s not merely relative to actual values for 2007 but relative to projections for 2008, as 
tourism receipts were expected to grow by 32 percent i n 2008 and 24 percent in 2009 .

supply inputs, including food, handicrafts and light manufacturing.

o f inflationary pressures. Continued f isca l discipline and the fixed exchange rate with respect to the euro 
provide a solid anchor for low inflationary expectations. 

13. 

While the medium-term impact o f the global economic slowdown on Cape Verde i s hard to 
estimate, Cape Verde has built up some buffers against external shocks as a result o f strong 
economic performance in recent years. The Authorities have some scope to manage the external 
shocks since the country has built up f isca l space and international reserves that enable Cape Verde to 
mitigate their impact. Progress in the implementation o f structural measures has also been steady, 
reinforcing the positive e f f e c t s o f prudent macroeconomic management. Inflation i s expected to stabilize 
at around 2 percent by 2010-1 1, in line with euro zone rates, as a resu l t o f the currency peg. Despite 
continued f i s c a l prudence, the overall budget deficit (including grants) i s projected to increase steeply to 
5.7 percent o f GDP in 2009 to provide some f i s c a l stimulus and average about 5 percent o f GDP during 
20 10- 12. Tax revenues as a percentage o f GDP are expected to decline as the economy slows down but 
average 22 percent for 2010-12. Overall expenditure i s projected at 37 percent o f GDP in 2009, notably 
due to an expansion in public investment designed to ease infrastructure bottlenecks. Spending w i l l 
gradually decline to 34 percent in 2012. Improvements in tax administration and in public expenditure 
management w i l l help to contain the f i s c a l deficit. The overall budget and the Government's medium 
term f isca l program are appropriate as the spending expansion i s directed to in fras truc ture spending, the 
deficit i s mostly financed by concessional loans, and debt sustainability i s preserved. The current account 
deficit (including o f f i c i a l transfers), which deteriorated from 5 percent o f GDP in 2006 to 9.1 percent in 
2007 and 13 percent o f GDP in 2008 i s projected to deteriorate further to 14.7 percent o f GDP in 2009 as 
a result o f the slowdown in tourism receipts and remittances. Projections indicate that the current account 
deficit (including official transfers) w i l l improve slightly to 13.9 percent in 2010 and average 12 percent a 
year during 201 1-2012. As the Cape Verdean economy recovers and the economic conditions in Europe 
improve, imports o f investment goods are expected to increase-largely driven by FD I inflows-and 
tourism receipts w i l l grow, although remittances are expected to remain subdued. Notwithstanding the 
large current account deficit, international reserves are projected to remain above 3 months o f imports.

Significant progress with debt sustainability management sets a good basis f o r maintaining 
sustainable debt levels over the medium term. The share o f total central Government net debt and 
guarantees to GDP started to decline in 2005, and has been declining sharply since then. I t f e l l to 57 
percent o f GDP in 2008, down from 87 in 2005, owing to the rapid GDP growth and prudent f i s c a l 
stance. The domestic debt-to-GDP ratio was reduced from 3 3 in 2005 to 13.8 percent in 2008. An 
analysis o f the sustainability o f Cape Verde’s public debt carried out in December 2008 concluded that, 
despite the likely gradual reduction in access to concessional loans, the risk o f debt distress i s low and a l l 
external debt indicators would remain below the relevant thresholds under the baseline and alternative 
scenarios (see Appendix 3). The main risks to the debt outlook are currency exposure and contingent 
liabilities. Notwithstanding the f a c t that the debt trajectory has shifted upwards s ince the 2008 Debt 
Sustainability Analysis (DSA), Cape Verde’s risk o f debt distress remains low. 

15. 

The medium term effects o f the rapidly changing external environment on Cape Verde’s 
economy are difficult to gauge and overall risks remain tilted towards the down-side. A preliminary 
sensitivity analysis undertaken in March 2009 shows that a decline in tourism inflows equivalent to 1 
percent o f GDP would reduce current growth projections by around 0.75-1 percentage points, with a more 
modest impact on the f i s c a l balance, o f 0.1 percent o f GDP. l5 Due to partial self-stabilization-xplained 
by the fact that l e s s tourism implies the need for l e s s imports for tourism-the 
impact on the balance o f 
payments would be small, between 0-0.1 months o f prospective imports. An increase in o i l prices o f 
US$10 per barrel (from US$44 per barrel) would reduce the growth rate by 0.1-0.3 percentage points and 
would have an effect on the balance o f payments equivalent to around 0.1 months o f prospective imports, 
however the f isca l impact would be negligible. There are also downward risks to the economic outlook 
associated with steeper decreases in FD I and other capital flows, including donor assistance. Indeed the 
tightening o f liquidity conditions in Europe has already led to a deceleration in new real estate projects 
because developers, mainly Europeans, have faced difficulties securing long-term financing.I6 Moreover, 
remittances could decline further as a result o f weakening labor markets in the European Union, with 
potentially negative e f fec ts on household welfare and on external balances. Additional risks include 
volatility in commodity prices and a potential indirect impact o f the financial c r i s i s on Cape Verde banks. 
While domestic banks have virtually no exposure to sub-prime assets, ownership o f banks in Cape Verde 
i s highly concentrated under Portuguese ownership. A further f isca l risk derives from Electra, the public 
electricity and water utility, which i s in a critical financial situation. Losses equivalent to 1.3 percent o f 
GDP erased half o f Electra’s net worth in 2007, and credit has been curtailed by the o i l companies that 
constitute i t s main suppliers. The resulting power supply disruptions have an immediate negative impact 
on economic growth. The explicit risks to the budget are known, as domestic debt equal to around 4.5 
percent o f GDP at the end o f 2008 had to be issued in favor o f Electra.” 

16. 

A number of,factors help to mitigate these down-side r isks . The mitigating factors include: 
the recent build-up o f foreign exchange reserves and f i s c a l space; the accumulation o f gra in stocks to 
buffer against droughts and other food shocks;” the standing line o f credit extended by the Central Bank 
o f Portugal to support the peg o f the escudo to the euro; effective public expenditure management (with 
expanded public investment foreseen in 2009 together with res tra in t on current expenditures); and 
continued adherence to the IMF PSI. I n addition, the Government has a strong track record o f f i s c a l 
discipline and o f rapid and prudent adjustments to changing economic  condition^.'^ This w i l l place the 

l 5 T h e potential impacts identified in the (partial) sensitivity analysis do not take in to account shifts i n structure or off-setting 
policy measures by the Government that could potentially mitigate e f fec ts such as weaker tourism demand or FDI. 
l6 Sensitivity analysis indicates that an adverse shock to FDI, grants or remittances equivalent to 1 percent o f GDP would yield 
impacts on GDP, the balance o f payments and fiscal accounts that are similar to those for tourism inflows. 
” The implicit fiscal risks are currently being assessed by the government, especially the amounts needed to recapitalize the

KEY DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES 

3.1 PROMOTING EFFECTIVE GOVERNANCE 

17. 

Cape Verde could usefully consolidate and extend significant recent advances in 
governance. I t receives fairly high ratings for r u l e o f law and accountability.20 I t has conducted a ser ies 
o f reforms since 2005 that are described in more detail in the CAS Completion Report (see Appendix 2). 
However, important reforms remain to be completed in such areas as state reform and decentralization, 
procurement and financial management, and security and the r u l e o f law. The Government i s committed 
to advancing on these reforms under the f i r s t pillar o f t h e GPRSP-11. 

18. 

A broad and participatory State restructuring effort has been well designed but civil service 
reform (CSR) has been slow and some follow-up actions may be politically difficult. The 
Government has launched a comprehensive review o f its CSR legal and regulatory framework, with the 
goal o f providing the State with a better trained and motivated workforce. Several c ruc ia l pieces o f 
legislations have been drafted or adopted already,21 and a human resource database has been developed 
and integrated with payroll, which i s a key step towards CSR. However, progress has been delayed by 
vested interests and by the need to identify the requisite techn ica l skills to design key parts o f the reform 
package, e.g. in relation to remuneration. Further work i s required on streamlining, organizing and 
enhancing the capacity and efficiency o f the civil service to meet the GPRSP-I1 objective o f efficient 
attention to citizens' needs. As an example, a fairly straightfonvard merging o f functions has proven 
difficult to implement in the case o f the Road Institute and a unit with overlapping functions in the 
Ministry. 

19. 

Decentralization i s taking root but further reform i s needed to reap the full benefits. Since 
municipalities in Cape Verde are 
and have limited resource bases, central Government transfers 
constitute their most important source o f funds. Municipalities have become active in their areas of 
responsibilities, and transfers to them have risen since the 2005 local finances law, but the framework law 
on decentralization, adopted by the Council o f Ministers in March 2008, s t i l l needs to be ratified by 
Parliament and implementation in order to rationalize existing state structures, and i t has been difficult to 
achieve a consensus. The Government recogn izes that key challenges include: (a) enhancing the regional 
coordination model without creating more s truc tures ; (b) clarifying roles and responsibilities not only 
through the law but via concrete transfers agreements/decisions; and (c) addressing such issues as land 
sales regulation, municipalities' arrears and accountability. 

20. 

The Government intends to consolidate important achievements in the area o f financial 
management and e-government. Achievements during the past few years under the e-government 
initiative, under the auspices of the NOS1 (the Operational Nucleus for the Information Society, or Cubo 
Verde Digital), include: (a) rollout o f a functioning Integrated Financial Management and Information 
System (known as SIGOF) in the national Government and the largest municipalities; (b) timely

for control functions and strengthening o f the Court o f Auditors, and (e) reengineering o f various 
administrative processes to create an electronic single-window for the most used services. Further 
extension and capacity building around systems, as well as ensuring appropriate treatment o f contingent 
liabilities and introducing program-budgeting to align annual budgets with the GPRSP-I1 and both 
sectoral and overall Medium Term Expenditure Frameworks (MTEFs) are key priorities. I n addition, the 
Government intends to further the financial management reforms in the areas o f (a) oversight o f f isca l 
risks at the sub-national level; (b) oversight o f contingent liabilities related to public sector entities; (c) 
increasing the effectiveness and coverage o f internal controls, which w i l l require further recruitment and 
capacity building, and (d) enhancing the scope, content and follow-up o f external audits conducted 
through the Tribunal das Contas, which w i l l also require further recruitment and capacity building. 
Moreover, the Authorities consider that the timeliness and comprehensiveness o f donor information on 
projects could also be enhanced. 

21. 

A new procurement law in line with international good practices sets a good foundation for 
further progress on procurement reform. The new law was approved by the Legislature in 2007 and 
implementing rules and regulations were issued in December 2 0 0 8 . A new procurement management and 
information system i s being set up that w i l l be linked with the SIGOF. The critical next steps include 
establishing the new public procurement institutional framework, which includes a new regulatory 
authority (known as ARAP) to deal with policy, complaints and audits, as well as procurement 
management units in the contracting authorities to conduct procurement transactions a t the level o f these 
authorities. The Government i s now working towards accompanying the above steps with comprehensive 
national procurement capacity development, a strengthened procurement control framework and effective 
independent audits by ARAP to ensure compliance with the new r u l e s . 

22. 

Cape Verde has taken steps to address challenges from the global drugs trade and from 
money-laundering that could undermine security and good governance. Cape Verde has been caught 
up in a rerouting o f drugs from Colombia and Venezuela through various West African States for 
consumption in Europe, and the fragile conditions o f some States on the African continent has served to 
enhance the risk fo r Cape Verde as well. Moreover, its large off-shore banking sector makes i t vulnerable 
to money laundering (see Section 3.3). A t the same time, street crime had begun to r i s e in Praia and on 
Sal. The Authorities have taken prompt enforcement measures to address these challenges before they 
take root and have implemented measures in the area o f national defense and security and the r u l e o f 
l a d 3 that are c ruc ia l fo r safeguarding the quality o f l i f e o f Cape Verdeans and attracting and protecting 
foreign investments. Indeed, Praia i s seen by international investors as one o f the most secure capitals on 
the continent. At a sub-regional level, Cape Verde has been coordinating with other ECOWAS countries 
on security issues. Cape Verde has hosted two international conferences on drugs enforcement and on 
anti-money laundering (AML) since October 2 0 0 8 to brainstorm on effective approaches, has adopted 
legislation on AML to strengthen controls, and i s developing legislation to counter the financing o f 
terrorism (CFT), although more w i l l need to be done in the context o f strengthened banking supervision, 
notably o f the off-shore banking sector. These are more crime-focused aspects o f a broader program to 
strengthen the rule o f law that has been under way to promote greater access to justice through, e.g., 
digitization o f the laws and the Official Gazette, establishment o f Casas de Direito (legal centers) to 
provide legal services to the poor (with a particular focus on women), and strengthening o f alternative 
dispute resolution mechanisms. 

23 These inc lude the crea t ion o f the Na t iona l Police, the re fo rm o f the A rm e d Forces, the t ra in ing o f the j u d i c i a l po l ice and the 
enhancement o f ma r i t ime surveillance.

3.2 

STRENGTHENING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT 

23. 

Cape Verde’s key challenge in the area o f human development i s a misalignment between 
the s k i l l s required in the jobs market and the education and training provided to its youth. While 
Cape Verde has made significant progress in primary and secondary education, the country faces a 
significant challenge in ensuring employment opportunities for its relatively young population. The main 
reason i s that insufficient youth emerge from secondary schools or from the Technical and Vocational 
Education and Training (TVET) system with the requisite skills sets for the services and technology 
industry.24 Higher education in Cape Verde i s still nascent, with the country’s two universities (one 
private, one public) established only in 2001 and 2005 and as yet characterized by fairly limited and 
inequitable access. The challenge i s : (a) to better identify market demand for skilled labor in specific 
growth sectors such as construction, tourism and commerce; (b) to improve the existing planning, 
financing and coordination mechanisms in order to promote more, and more effective, demand-driven 
training delivery using existing, under-utilized training centers in more cost-effective ways and with 
greater engagement by the private sector. The required techn ica l and managerial skills for key sectors 
such as tourism, construction and finance are still rare, and those who possess them often have higher 
ambitions. Thus upgrading TVET i s imperative to ensure Cape Verde’s competitiveness in growth 
sectors, and to this end, the Government recently created an I n s t i t u t e for Employment and Professional 
Training to address these issues . 

24. 

Cape Verde has satisfactory health indicators fo r i t s level o f income, but faces challenges in 
terms o f adequate resources to address both infectious diseases and the rising non-communicable 
diseases that characterize a middle income country. As noted above (Section 2.2), Cape Verde has 
made significant progress in reducing both infant and maternal mortality rates, increasing l i f e expectancy, 
and containing the spread o f infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. However, its open 
economy, large inflows o f tourism and proximity to the continent place Cape Verde at continued risk o f 
communicable diseases, while the cost o f outreach to more remote underserved populations i s high. A t 
the same time, as l i f e expectancy has increased, so has the prevalence o f non-communicable diseases 
(NCDs), such as hypertension and diabetes, which generally imply much higher unit costs to treat. The 
National Health Policy for 2007-10 identifies addressing NCDs and promoting preventive health as key 
priorities; proposes possible scenarios which would sustain the development o f the health system, and 
develops strategic orientations for health sector reforms. A subsequent public expenditure tracking 
survey fo r the health sector detected several problems to be addressed, such as weak budgeting and 
expenditures processes at the decentralized level (delegacias de satide). Thus an appropriately resourced 
program i s needed to increase coverage and efficiency in health services. 

3.3 ADDRESSING STRUCTURAL AND SECTORAL CHALLENGES FOR COMPETITIVENESS 

25. 

Cape Verde has taken numerous measures to promote competitiveness, even though i t still 
faces a range o f challenges. The key areas in which further advances are required are related to the ease 
o f doing business, support for smaller businesses, access to land and finance, the cost o f labor, and trade 
facilitation. Substantial progress has been made in each o f these areas in recent years, but there i s further 
scope to promote a robust reform agenda in each case. 

26. 

Cape Verde has been advancing solidly on the ease o f doing business and i s turning to 
increase support to micro and small-scale enterprises. Although Cape Verde experienced a decline in 
i t s Doing Business ranking in 2009 , the ranking has not captured the remarkable improvements in the 

24 To reduce unemployment to 10 percent by 2012, 6,000 people need to be trained annually. In 2008, only 1,853 were trained. 

10 

ease o f starting o f a business in Cape Verde.25 The one-stop shops-known as Casu do Cidadzo-on Sa l 
and in.Praia enable entrepreneurs to register a business in one day and citizens to obtain basic registration 
documents within minutes. S ince July 2008, more than 300 businesses have been registered within 24 
hours, and since December 2007 over 3,000 certificates have been issued through the on-line facility, 
including many to emigrants abroad. The 2009 Doing Business survey ranks Cape Verde at 79 (out of 
178 countries) for ease o f dealing with licenses and permits and 40 for enforcing contracts-its cost of 
enforcing contracts in terms o f both duration and expense are significantly ahead o f regional averages 
(see Appendix 4). Laws and regulations are publicly available (on the internet) and are not changed 
arbitrarily. Mechanisms exist to resolve con f l ic t o f r u l e s and these are regarded as highly transparent, 
ensuring a high level o f protection o f property rights. A greater challenge and a key priority fo r 
Government i s to enhance support to micro and small scale enterprises (MSMEs) to operate on a more 
equal footing. To this end, the Government launched the Agincia de Desenvolvimento EconGmico e 
ZnnovaqCo (ADEI) with a mandate to provide incubator services, coaching and consulting services, 
business development services including access to finance, market linkages, and promotion o f 
information and communication technology. Plans are under way to open the ADEI o f f i c e by July 2009. 
The agency w i l l face challenges in ensuring it has (a) highly qualified staff to provide high-value 
techn ica l assistance; (b) technology in f ras t ruc tu re , for the incubator and other information and 
communications technology requirements; (c) a management information system that i s up to the task, 
and (d) a c lear demarcation o f responsibilities with NOS I . 

27. 

Effective land management i s an essential element o f a policy to promote competitiveness. 
A new land use law has been approved and a law on land registration i s well advanced. The legal 
framework fo r titling and applying l i e n s for most lands i s c lear and land i s frequently used to collateralize 
loans. Moreover, the implementation o f the cadastre system i s progressing well with UNDP support. At 
the same time, loca l governments are not yet well equipped to deal adequately with land management 
issues, and rural-urban migration has led to squatting on public lands in rural areas or at the urban 
periphery, with unclear control rights for the de facto tenants. I n addition, land registration remains 
expensive and time consuming, leading to problems with unregistered transactions and subsequent delays 
i n regularization or in compensating true owners i f the land i s to be reallocated for public use. Land use 
planning thus, features as an in teg ra l element o f the GPRSP pillar on infrastructure development. 

28. While the new labor law contains some positive reforms, various elements o f the reform 
have increased rigidities in the labor market that need to be addressed. A new labor law was 
approved in 2007, following many years o f negotiations among the Government, unions and the business 
sector, and reflects a delicate balance o f different interests. The law introduces some favorable labor 
market measures, notably the elimination o f wage indexation to inflation-which 
i s important in light of 
Cape Verde’s currency peg and consequent limitations on devaluation as a means o f enhancing 
competitiveness-and greater flexibility for employers to change selected aspects o f the labor contract. 
At the same time, the law introduced important protections for workers, including limits to the number o f 
years workers can be offered temporary contracts, the obligation to pay vacation days not taken, more 
days o f maternity leave, and extended worker protections. The key challenge i s that it remains difficult to 
release a redundant or non-performing worker, requiring a sequence o f notices and compensation that i s 
regarded as costly. This in turn means tha t only a relatively privileged few enjoy the benefits o f these 
protections since the cost o f firing workers i s an important factor behind the creation o f less formal sector 
informal sector i s estimated to account for 40 percent o f the economy. W h i l e labor 
jobs-the 
productivity i s high in Cape Verde, the high costs o f labor relative to the value o f their output make i t 
hard for the country to compete (see Figure 1). Therefore success fu l pursuit o f Cape Verde’s economic 
transformation agenda w i l l require additional labor reforms, especially in relation to the cost o f firing 

*’ A one-stop shop for business registration had been open on Sal since March 2007 and a second one-stop shop was opened in 
the capital c i ty in July 2008, however the Do ing Business survey was l im i ted to the capital c i ty and had a cu t-o f f o f June 2008.

workers, so as not to undermine the advantages offered by its geo-strategic location-even as i t seeks to 
maintain social cohesion with its labor policy. I n light o f the delicacy o f these reforms, the Government 
i s evaluating the appropriate timing for next steps in this area.

Cape Verde has a large financial sector relative to its GDP that has in general been able to 
support the goals o f growth and economic development. The market for financial services appears 
competitive and credit has supported (and outpaced) the recent high growth rates in the economy. The 
country has five on-shore commercial banks with assets amounting to about 90 percent o f GDP. They are 
funded in large measure by emigrants, who provide half o f a l l time deposits. Cape Verde also has seven 
functioning off-shore banks and several others that have recently been licensed but are not yet operating, 
with total assets amounting to an additional 150 percent o f GDP.26 A l l banks are private. The two largest 
on-shore banks (both foreign-owned) account for 90 percent o f the on-shore market by assets. The 
banking sector i s amply profitable and-being 
relatively well-insulated from developments in 
international financial markets-has 
so far been l i t t l e affected by the f inanc ia l turmoil. Second-round 
effects from the global slowdown may prove more important, as large tourism-related construction 
projects slow and remittances decline, although this must be weighed against continued overall growth in 
the economy. Domestic banks have experienced no apparent pressure on deposits or on wholesale 
funding from parent banks. Still, strong domestic credit growth and strengthened prudential regulations 
drove the aggregate capital asset ra t io of the banking sector down to the prudentially required minimum 
o f 10 percent, implying inadequate capital to support further rapid growth or a severe downturn. 
Moreover, the strong re l iance on emigrant deposits presents a risk in a system without deposit insurance 
that competes for funding with insured U.S. and Euro area banks.27 

30. 

Even with Cape Verde's large financial sector, access to finance remains challenging f o r 
smaller enterprises and there are certain risks that warrant close supervision. I n terms o f access to 
finance, credit to the private sector i s well above the regional average-at 45 percent o f GDP-and 
banking transactions have been facilitated by the rapid spread o f ATMs, point-of-sale transactions and 
electronic banking since 2000, however the Government remains concerned about adequate access to 
finance for SMEs. W h i l e around 45 percent o f firms have loans, small, domestically-owned 
microenterprises, notably those whose managers have less education, face difficulties in obtaining 

26 The banking sector dwarfs the nascent stock market, which had a capitalization o f 16 percent o f GDP at end-2007 and limited 
turnover, especially o f shares. 
'' Banks see the 14 percent reserve requirement and 50 percent loan-to-deposit ratio as reassuring to depositors. 

12 

overdrafts or loans.28 However, an arguably more pressing concern fo r the f inanc ia l sector i s that the o f f - 
shore sector i s on the one hand not contributing significantly to the Government’s objective o f 
diversifying growth in the economy, and on the other hand, presents important risks, especially 
reputational risk. This i s because: (a) balance sheets have been expanding rapidly as non-resident 
deposits have been attracted by favorable bank-secrecy and taxation regimes; (b) the regulatory regime i s 
lighter than for on-shores; (c) compliance with prudential requirements-including capital adequacy-is 
low, and (d) there has been forbearance in supervision mostly as a result o f inadequate use o f enforcement 
tools. The risks o f money laundering and vulnerability to contagion from the financial c r i s i s in other 
countries are therefore also higher. Priority reforms to mitigate reputational and other risks should focus 
on harmonizing the regulatory framework with those for the on-shore sector, tightening licensing 
requirements to allow only banks with clear majority ownership links with well-supervised financial 
institutions abroad to operate in Cape Verde, implementing the newly approved anti-money laundering 
legislation and strengthening supervisory practices and capacity. 

31 . 

Cape Verde has taken several key steps to reduce trade barriers and facilitate trade, 
including accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO). In 2004, a streamlined tariff regime 
was introduced that removed discriminatory taxes on trade, other than bands established with ECOWAS 
partners, and brought the sin l e average most-favored nation tariff down to 10.9 percent. I n July 2008, 
Cape Verde became the 153‘ member o f the WTO, and the country expects to enter into an Economic 
Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the European Union (EU), which i s by far i t s largest trading partner. 
Cape Verde also has relative efficient customs when compared with other countries on the continent. I t s 
introduction o f ASYCUDA++ systems accelerated processing o f cargo, and procedures are relatively 
streamlined in terms o f the number o f steps for approvals, although there i s still scope to reduce the 
number o f days for exporting and importing products-nineteen and five, respectively.

3.4 INVESTING 

IN INFRASTRUCTURE 

32 . 

Investment in infrastructure i s critical f o r the Government’s economic transformation 
agenda, especially in energy, water, transportation, and infrastructure fo r the tourism and fisheries 
sectors. The Government has a limited ability to tap into long-term financing for infrastructure projects. 
Despite significant flows o f private investments to tourism and r e a l estate, the country r e l i e s heavily on 
donors to finance major public investments. Cape Verde invests heavily in infrastructure (US$400 per 
capita in 2006), however a review o f the broader reform agenda suggests that infrastructure i s the key area 
i n which c lea r progress on reforms, including more public-private partnerships (PPPs), i s most required to 
achieve economic transformation. 

33 . 

The high cost and inadequate supply o f electricity i s without doubt one o f the most 
important constraints to the economic development o f the country.29 While Cape Verde w i l l always 
face high costs o f electrification as an archipelago, the present sector arrangements warrant s ign i f ican t 
upgrading and a reassessment. Electra, the national power utility, supplies electricity in the nine inhabited 
islands o f the country and also operates as a water distribution utility in the four main islands.30 Electra’s 
financial performance has deteriorated rapidly, mainly due to lack o f investments in generation, delayed 
and partial tariff adjustments, customer arrears, obsolete equipment, and an escalation o f non-technical 

** Recent studies by IFC PEP-Africa and t h e 2006 Investment Climate Assessment point to weak capacity for preparing bankable 
projects as an impediment to accessing credit, i n addition to the cost o f credit. 
29 The 2008 DTIS and 2006 ICA survey findings indicate that electricity supply i s by far the number one constraint faced by 
Cape Verdean operators. Sixty percent o f enterprises consider that power supply i s a major obstacle to their operations, and the 
private sector reports that outages account for losses amounting to up to 1 1 percent o f sales. Enterprises also complain o f high 
rates (twice those o f Portugal) and poor service. 
30 The main islands are Santiago, SsLo Vicente, Boavista and Sal. Water supplies in the smaller islands are managed by the 
municipalities. 

13 

losses due to fraud and unauthorized connections to the grid (see Box 1). W h i l e Electra increased 
generation by over 8 percent per year to 250MWh during 2002-06, the current system r e l i e s almost 
entirely on multiple, inefficiently small, expensive and polluting diesel-run generators on each island, 
connected to clients by an inadequately low voltage transmission system and an ageing distribution 
network. The resulting power supply disruptions have an immediate negative impact on economic 
growth, and while power outages are infrequent compared to other countries in the region, there i s not yet 
a widespread practice o f back-up generation so that the outages are more costly and disruptive to 
business. Even though Cape Verde has exceptional wind energy potential, at 3 percent o f generation this 
i s as yet largely untapped. Finally, with losses equivalent to 1.3 percent o f GDP in just one year (2007) 
erasing half o f Electra’s net worth, the company i s de-capitalized and without credit from its main 
suppliers, the o i l companies. The explicit f i s c a l risks to the budget are clear, s ince domestic debt issued 
to cover Electra’s losses reached approximately 4.5 percent o f GDP by the end o f 2008.31 Government 
therefore intends to invest heavily in more sustainable, low-cost wind generation (including via PPPs) and 
in upgrading the network while seeking greater efficiency in the management o f Electra. 

Box 1. Electra’s Inst itut iona l and Operat iona l Challenges 
Access to electricity in Cape Verde i s relatively high at 70 percent (90 percent in urban areas but l e s s than 50 percent i n rural 
areas). The cost o f electricity and water service provision i s high due to the small scale o f each service center and consequent 
widespread use o f diesel rather than l e s s expensive heavy fuel o i l for thermal generation, scarcity o f fresh water resources and 
the need to desalinize sea water, and high logistical costs due to the insularity o f the country. 
Unsatisfactory and deteriorating financial performance. Electra was privatized i n 1999, when EDP (the main Portuguese 
integrated power u t i l i ty) acquired a majority equity stake, and coverage expanded rapidly un t i l 2003, when most o f the key 
relevant indicators began to deteriorate. T h e company’s disappointing operational performance, combined with delayed and 
partial tar i f f adjustments, resulted in a deterioration o f Electra’s financial performance, and s ince EDP and the Authorities 
were unable to resolve their dispute over tariffs, they agreed in 2006 to an amicable resolution involving a financial 
restructuring o f Electra that reduced its debts substantially (from €76 to €45 million) and raised Government’s ownership 
stake to 85 percent, and EDP departed. A new management team took over, but has not been able to improve Electra’s 
operational performance. On the contrary, distribution losses rose to 25 percent in 2007, compared to 18 percent i n 2003, with 
losses exceeding 30 percent in Praia, reflecting a significant level o f uncontrolled fraud. 
K e y challenges. These include: (a) improving the company’s commercial performance; (b) ensuring the approval o f more 
timely and better calibrated tar i f f adjustments by the Economic Regulation Agency (ARE); (c) significantly increasing 
generation and reducing its cost by consolidating generation in larger units using heavy fuel oil, upgrading transmission lines, 
and pursuing substantial investment in wind energy through independent power producer arrangements (which would also 
provide a steady supply o f energy during non-peak hours for desalination); (d) upgrading the ageing distribution network; (e) 
instituting good corporate governance practices i n Electra, with more active monitoring, and (9 mobilizing direct financing 
and guarantees for Electra. 

34. Water supply i s a critical issue owing to low and erratic rainfall. The country has the lowest 
underground water resources in sub-Saharan Africa after Djibouti. Water i s an expensive commodity.32 
Desalination plants require substantial energy supplies and account for about 88 percent o f the water 
supplied by Electra, although use rs complement this with water from surface run-off or underground 
sources (using wells and boreholes) that i s not supplied by Electra. Electra’s production o f water 
averaged slightly over 4 million cubic meters during 2003-06, o f which around 30 percent translated into 
losses rather than sales, which i s worrisome in light o f the high cost o f desalination. 

3 5 . 

Effective regulation o f serv ice providers i n the various infrastructure sectors i s essential. To 
this end, the Government established the Ag2nciu de RegulumentuCfio EconGmicu (ARE) in 2004 to 
regulate petroleum products, electricity, water, telecommunications and urban and maritime passenger 

3 ’ The implicit fiscal risks are currently being assessed by the government, especially the amounts needed to recapitalize the 
company. 
3 2 The costs o f running generators and buying desalinated water are two o f the cost drivers behind the 11 percent o f total hotel 
operating costs which are made up by utilities. 

14 

transport. Since then, responsibility for telecommunications has been transferred to the National Agency 
for Communications. ARE i s responsible for setting and implementing tariffs fo r petroleum products, 
electricity and water but has not always carried out this mandate effectively, and w i l l require further 
capacity-building support. 

36. 

Transportation i s another key area requiring a strong reform agenda, one that takes an 
integrated, multi-modal approach to linking the islands o f the archipelago. There has been rapid 
growth in the movement o f vessels, merchandise and passengers between 1995 and 2006. For example, 
tons o f merchandise rose by 260 percent to 1.7 million tons and the number o f passengers increased by 
250 percent to 673,000 over the period. Nevertheless, shipping costs in Cape Verde are extremely high, 
with a container costing €1,000 to transport from Praia to Sal versus €2,000 from Lisbon to Sal. Inter- 
island transport costs not only erode the cost advantage o f Cape Verdean suppliers over overseas 
suppliers but also discourage economic activities in the peripheral islands that depend on inputs from 
outside. While the Government has privatized inter-island shipping, the maritime fleet33 remains small 
and obsolete, providing insufficient and unreliable services. Moreover, logistical f a c i l i t i e s for transferring 
cargo from maritime to road or a i r transport are extremely limited, adding to storage costs and delays that 
undermine competitiveness. Impressive investment has been undertaken to upgrade airports (in Praia and 
on Sal, Silo Vicente and Boa Vista), and port fac i l i t ies (notably in Mindelo and Praia, with plans under 
way to expand the port o f Palmeira on Sal), as well as to rehabilitate the core road network to a level that 
can be maintained on a sustainable basis. Nonetheless, bottlenecks in coordination between air, sea 
(ferry) and road transport remain to be addressed to support trade, tourism and inter-island connectivity 
more broadly. Addressing these bottlenecks i s essential i f Cape Verde wishes to make use o f i t s geo- 
strategic location to achieve its economic transformation objectives. 

37. 

The transportation sector concentrates most o f the key unfinished elements o f Cape Verde’s 
privatization agenda, and reform o f the sector i s essential to the country’s development. W h i l e port 
infrastructure i s undergoing considerable rehabilitation and upgrading to address physical constraints, 
management o f the sector by the State’s port authority, ENAPOR, continues to be inadequate, with an 
unwieldy bureaucracy and poor governance that deter investment in inter-island shipping services. There 
i s strong political w i l l to develop Cape Verde as a hub/gateway for cargo and passengers; however Cape 
Verde s u f f e r s from competition from Dakar, which has a much larger cargo base and equally rapid 
customs clearance. Privatization o f ENAPOR has long been on the Government’s agenda but has been 
delayed since the 1990s4ue in part to the difficulties it would likely imply in down-sizing the number 
o f stevedores and administrative port staff. The same holds for Estaleiros Navais de Cabo Verde 
(CABNAVE), a shipyard, and INTERBASE, a fish freezing and storage facility. In the case o f a ir 
transport, the national airline (Transportes Ae‘reos de Cabo Verde or TACV) has long been slated fo r 
privatization but the process has been postponed repeatedly due to s t i f f resistance within the firm, the 
dilemma o f how to handle less profitable inter-island routes and insufficient political commitment. Until 
recently, TACV had a monopoly on domestic flights and it continues to etljoy public subsidies, although 
competitive carr iers have now been allowed to open scheduled services in the domestic market. Good 
international access via a i r and reliable inter-island service w i l l be essen t ia l to drive down high 
transportation costs, which i s i n turn essential so as not to constrain growth in Cape Verde’s tourism 
industry. Thus to achieve the economic transformation objective o f becoming an international hub for 
transshipments and transit, Cape Verde w i l l need to make transformative changes in institutional 
arrangements for its ports and its a i r transport. 

38 . 

Since tourism accounts fo r 18 percent o f GDP and the vast majority of FDI, i t i s important 
that a long-term comprehensive strategy be developed f o r investing in the sector. The Government 
i s preparing a Tourism M a s t e r Plan that should clarify how the country’s development strategy w i l l 

3 3 The 13 members o f the association o f ship-owners have a fleet o f about 20 vessels i n operating condition. 

15 

pursue tourism development; what kind o f tourism should be pursued; how benefits can be extended to 
more islands and to small enterprises through the value chain; what kind o f infrastructure investments (in 
water, electricity and waste management) are needed to sustain the industry; what kind o f structuring o f 
investment incentives i s required to ensure sustained rather than speculative investment, and how to 
ensure that tourism i s not developed at the expense o f the environment. Moving forward, i t i s c lear that 
more careful zoning and development master plans are needed to promote desirable spatial development 
within municipalities or fo r each island, and further engagement o f the municipalities and UNOTUR, the 
new Chamber o f Tourism, i s warranted with regard to the development o f tourism on public lands under 
the Integrated Tourism Development Zones. Finally, i t w i l l be important to systematically brand Cape 
Verde in a way that looks beyond its white sand beaches to highlight the country’s more unique cultural 
and natural features, including its music. 

39. 

The fisheries sector needs investment in infrastructure and strengthening of its institutional 
and regulatory framework. The sector’s contribution to GDP has fa l len from 2 percent o f GDP in 2000 
to 1 percent in 2007 , however with 60 o f this generated by small-scale fishermen (who generally earn 
incomes well below average GDPhapita), the sector may represent as much as 5 percent o f the 
economically active population-creating jobs for small-scale fishermen, fishmongers (most o f whom are 
women) and seasonal workers employed in industrial fishing and canning. There i s limited industrial 
fishing by publicly owned fleets and productivity has been low. Fish resources are not exploited, handled 
or graded effectively; current subsidies for ice, fuel and vessel credits are not well targeted, and the sector 
i s facing overfishing as production has not risen beyond 10,000 tons per year. The 2007 World Bank 
Fisheries Assessment concluded that Cape Verde simply has l e s s exploitable fish than has been assumed 
in the past and has been unable to recently assess the status o f major fish stocks; the most likely scenario 
suggests that most fish resources are fully or over-exploited. Furthermore, most o f the country’s fish 
resources are high value fish in deep waters and illegal fishing by foreign ships i s a problem as Cape 
Verde only has a very limited surveillance capacity. I t also has a relatively weak capacity to negotiate 
with the large foreign companies or make inroads into the complex commercial arrangements prevailing 
in many EU markets.34 Moreover, s i g n i f i c a n t upgrading o f in fras truc ture and management capacity w i l l 
be required to realize the economic transformation objective o f turning Cape Verde into a regional fishing 
center, since INTERBASE i s not energy e f f i c i e n t and does not meet EU sanitary requirements (which 
prevents European fishing vessels from storing their catch before returning to Europe) and faces stiff 
competition from L a s Palmas and Dakar. Reforms are therefore required in the sector to seize the 
opportunities that it offers, notably to address the challenges faced by INTERBASE, reduce small-scale 
fishing e f for t , promote alternative livelihoods to fishing, and adjust industrial f i s h e r i e s to their 
commercial potential. 

40. 

The country’s important infrastructure and growth agenda will require effective 
environmental management to ensure that development i s sustainable. As noted earlier, Cape Verde 
has experienced some success in increasing forest cover. A t the same time, i t s limited institutional and 
supervisory capacity and shortcomings in enforcement o f environment-related legislation represent a 
concern. For example, inappropriate sewage and solid waste disposal or inadequate phytosanitary 
controls on handling o f foods can undermine the tourism industry. Despite the general robustness o f the 
environmental regulatory framework, there i s a need for a substantial increase in human resources and 
capacity at the level o f the country’s environmental directorate to ensure adequate implementation o f the 
ongoing Second National Environmental Action Plan35 and to enforce environment-related legislation. 

3 4 Cape Verde has a number o f international f isher ies agreements w i th international bodies and w i th the EU, Japan and a number 
o f A fr ican countries. T h e fishing licenses issued to E U flag vessels in 2008 are expected to yield €325,000. Licenses to Japan 
yielded US$144, 000 in 2007, and US$164,000 are forecast for 2008. 
3 5 The Second National Environmental Action Plan has a 10-year horizon (2004-2014). I t s general objective i s to provide the 
country w i th a strategy that promotes a rationale use o f natural resources and a sustainable management o f economic activities. 

16 

Other challenges include: (a) the sustainable management o f natural resources to m in im ize the negative 
impac t o f g row th on the environment; (b) the p romo t ion o f more env ironmen ta l ly friendly solutions such 
as investing in wind and other renewable energy sources; (c) addressing the lack o f water, sanitation, 
urban planning, and protection o f coastal zones; (d) containing the loss o f b iod ivers i ty ; and (e) curb ing 
i l lega l sand extraction and use fo r cement, since this bo th destroys coastal zones and can lead to salt-water 
contamination o f scarce freshwater aquifers. 

3.5 ENHANCING SOCIAL COHESION 
41. With the strong recent gains in poverty reduction, the timing i s now appropriate for 
implementing a better targeted social assistance strategy. As pover ty has been reduced dramatically 
during the last 20 years, the Government can consider targeting social assistance resources more closely 
t o the poor instead o f p rov id ing transfers and bene f i ts to a large share o f the popu la t ion that needs these 
transfers l e s s than before. There are s t i l l pockets o f poverty, especially on some o f the islands (see 
Append ix 5), and this poorer popu la t ion i s especially vulnerable to the deceleration in economic grow th 
associated with the g loba l economic 
Also, the cost o f universal programs such as school lunches 
i s high fo r the Government and earlier support fo r such interventions, such as f rom the W o r l d Food 
Programme, i s drying up as the country has achieved M I C status. Cape Verde has the technical capacity 
to implement targeted intervention and has begun to evaluate the merits o f alternative approaches. 

42. While promoting social solidarity i s an important aspect o f the Government’s strategy, the 
existing instruments used by the Government to achieve that goal fall short o f expectations. The 
Government has attempted to increase the effectiveness o f social po l ic ies v i a a comb ina t ion o f 
decentralization and commun i ty invo lvemen t o r commun i ty-dr iven in i t ia t ives that draw on the country’s 
well-organized community-based organizations. These pr inc ip les are at the core o f the new Na t iona l 
Program to Fight Poverty (PNLP). Yet good quantitative data on the impac t and cost effectiveness o f this 
program are no t available. There are also several direct cash transfers and a commun i ty- led sma l l works 
scheme that provides a safety n e t fo r ru ra l areas (known as Micro-realizap7esY wh ich has replaced the 
former ru ra l pub l ic works program, known as F A IMO ) . In addition, various ins t i tu t ions prov ide support 
fo r schooling fo r disadvantaged students and income-generating activities fo r single mothers. W h i l e these 
ind iv idua l programs may be u s e f u l as mechanisms t o protect the poor in times o f crisis, they are no t 
su f f ic ien t and do no t constitute a coherent social pro tec t ion strategy. Furthermore, the ir targeting 
performance i s no t well documented. A much more systematic approach wou ld be needed in t e rm s o f 
planning, coordinating, mon i to r ing and evaluating safety n e t programs. 

43. 

Implementing a conditional cash transfer (CCT) program can help to improve the targeting 
o f social assistance and have a greater impact in terms o f poverty reduction. There are several 
reasons that m i l i ta te in favor o f a CC T program aimed at increasing secondary enrollment rates among the 
poor : econometric analyses show that the r e t u r n s t o education become s ign i f ican t on ly with a secondary 
education, suggesting that a p r ima ry education i s no t enough t o emerge f rom poverty; costs are a key 
obstacle fo r sending ch i ldren t o secondary schools, especially fo r the (poorer) ru ra l population; unlike 
p r ima ry school education wh ich i s quasi-universal, there are very large differences in net secondary 
enrollments between the poorest and the richest quintiles?’ investment in secondary education i s needed 
fo r Cape Verde’s economic transformation to a competitive service economy, and secondary education 
prov ides you th with mob i le human capital that they can use anywhere in the country, especially in areas 
where j o b prospects are most attractive. Experience f rom a range o f L a t i n Amer ican countries suggests 
that CC T programs can be highly effective bo th as short-term transfer mechanisms to reduce pover ty and 

36 The evidence on the recent food price crisis suggests that households in the poorest areas were affected the most. 
3 7 Children from better o f f households a r e twice as likely to go to secondary school as children from the poorest households. 

17 

as long-term investments to reduce the transmission o f poverty from one generation to the next. Although 
no decision has been reached on CCT mechanisms in Cape Verde, the approach i s being studied. 

44. 

Another key area in which social cohesion can be strengthened i s social security. The system 
as a whole i s very young demographically, and there are more than ten contributors for each current 
benefit recipient, so that early measures to promote changes w i l l greatly reduce the long-term costs o f 
reforms. For example, the coverage o f contributing members by the National Institute o f Soc ia l Security 
(INPS) i s fairly limited, at one-quarter o f formal sector employees, although the number o f beneficiaries 
under the non-contributory solidarity support has been extended. In addition, while its defined benefit 
pension plan i s well funded, its medical coverage i s under-financed and drives up total contribution rates 
to well above 20 percent, which i s prohibitive for many employers and thus constrains formal sector 
employment. Third, the INPS surplus (o f about 2 percent o f GDP) and its accumulation o f reserves have 
in the past encouraged governments to press the INPS into purchasing Government bonds to finance 
budget deficits. As a result, the INPS investment portfolio i s heavily weighted towards non-tradable 
Government bonds, which has a direct effect on the long-term finances o f the scheme. Therefore a 
review o f investment policies i s warranted. 

45. 

The Diaspora also plays an important ro le in the country’s social cohesion and should be 
able to further its impact on development. Cape Verde’s remittances account for c lose to 10 percent o f 
GDP. These remittances have been instrumental not only in boosting incomes in the country but also in 
insuring against volatility. A large share i s channeled into loca l investments indirectly via banking 
system deposits that are on-lent to domestic enterprises, while the other main use o f remittances i s to 
increase and smooth household consumption. Proposals have a t times been floated to encourage 
recipients to u s e more o f their remittances to finance income-generating activities instead o f 
consumption-ven 
though the persons in charge o f remittance expenditure often lack entrepreneurial 
skills. More fruitful alternative ways to draw on the Cape Verdean Diaspora may be to create niche 
markets for the sale and marketing o f typically Cape Verdean products, and to facilitate knowledge 
transfers to local entrepreneurs from the skilled workers and entrepreneurs in the Diaspora. 

IV. 

CAPE VERDE’S DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY AND PR IOR IT IES 

4.1 CAPE VERDE’S V IS ION OF ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION 

46. 

Cape Verde’s development i s guided by the vision o f the economic transformation o f its 
economy in a way that takes advantage o f its geo-strategic position as well as its natural and 
cultural assets. This vision translates into a strategy to promote Cape Verde as a multi-purpose service 
centre, with a combination o f hub services for transshipment and distribution, fish processing and 
financial services, in addition to building on its growing tourism business. The Economic Transformation 
Strategy (ETS), which was grounded in extensive dialogue early in 2001, i s a t the foundation of the 
country’s earlier GPRSP for 2004-07 and i t s current strategy for 2008-11. I f focuses on ensuring 
consistent broad-based growth by expanding and diversifying the nation’s productive base and deepening 
reforms and investments to build a more competitive economy. 

18 

Box 2. Cape Verde’s Economic Transformation Strategy 
The key elements o f the ETS focus on building upon Cape Verde’s location to explore natural competitive advantages while 
using textiles and tourism as a bridge i n the near term. The comparative advantages include: (a) its location as a gateway to 
Africa; (b) the sea, and Cape Verde’s potential with its deep water ports as a hub for transshipments, its marine resources and 
fisheries, and its beaches and climate for tourism; (c) ‘air space’ with a ir cargo, passenger transportation, refueling, stopover 
duty-free shopping and air traffic control; (d) its good governance for its investment climate; (e) its strategic partners, fo r market 
access and trade relations, and ( f ) its relatively skilled human resources for use i n high-tech, high-end services. 
The transformation strategy envisages development o f several industry clusters around t h e sea, 
including processing and 
marketing o f marine resources for export in the sub-region, as well as having Cape Verde serve as a transshipment port. The 
strategy also proposes the development o f an offshore services industry to support the above-mentioned programs and to 
provide support services such as I T outsourcing, finance, investment and insurance to the Lusophone and African markets. I t 
also aims to attract increasingly high value-added tourism. 
Maximizing these advantages w i l l require (a) massive investments i n infrastructure development to attract investors, particularly 
to tourism, (b) non-traditional sources o f financing and increased private sector development, and (c) building human resources 
capacities and skills (that are specialized and high technology) to fu l ly develop an information and services economy. 

4.2 CAPE VERDE’S GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY FOR 2008-11 

47. 

The overarching objectives o f the GPRSP-I1 are to reduce unemployment to below 10 
percent, attain an accelerated real economic growth rate above 10 percent, and cut poverty by 
half?’ The four-year GPRSP-I1 draws on the ETS as well as strategic documents such as the Government 
Program and the ‘Grand Options o f the Plan’, and maintains the thrust o f the earlier GPRSP while putting 
greater emphasis on in f ras t ruc tu re and private sector development to support growth and reduce poverty. 
The specific actions are broadly grouped under the same five strategic pillars as for the first GPRSP: 

9 

9 

9 

9 

Pillar 1: Promote Government Reform. The objective i s to: modernize the public administration; 
design and implement better management practices in public finances; advance with decentralization, 
and undertake civil service reforms to streamline the administrative structure and upgrade human 
resource management and capacity building. The goal i s to ensure effective, accountable and 
transparent support to citizens within solid democratic institutions. The Government also aims to 
align spending allocations more closely with GPRSP-I1 priorities within a medium-term framework 
that emphasizes public investment for growth. 
Pillar 2: Develop Human Resources. The objective i s to develop more competitive human 
resources, with advanced levels o f scientific, technical and technological knowledge and the requisite 
skills for the services industries, while ensuring very broad access to educational opportunities. A 
key objective i s to increase employment, especially for youth, and to strengthen Cape Verde’s 
competitive advantage at a global level. 
Pillar 3: Competitiveness - Meeting the Challenges o f Sustainable Development and 
Globalization. The objective i s to pursue reforms and investments that ensure macroeconomic 
stability as a prerequisite for sustainable competitiveness, growth and development in the country and 
to strengthen productivity, the quality o f services, opportunities for employment, regulatory capacity 
and the business environment. 
Pillar 4: The Country’s Economic Infrastructure. The objective i s to increase investment in 
in fras truc ture to meet the daily needs o f i t s citizens, to overcome in fras truc ture bottlenecks, and to 
keep pace with the fas t growing tourism industry, in partnership with donors and the private sector. 

3 8 The Joint IDA - IMF Staff Advisory Note on the GPRSP-I1 (Report No . 43927-CV) was discussed by the Board on July 8, 2008. 

19 

9 Pillar 5: Strengthen Social Cohesion. The aim i s to substantially reduce poverty by reducing 
unemployment, improving access to microcredit, enhancing labor conditions, extending the coverage 
o f the soc ia l protection system, strengthening food security, ensuring better health se rv ices for all, 
supporting youth development and integration into the economy, and promoting the gender 
dimension. This would include the provision o f a more decentralized delivery o f social services. 

48. 

Cape Verde’s program under GPRSP-I1 i s costed at 82 billion Cape Verdean escudos, 
approximately equivalent to one billion U S dollars. Mo re than h a l f o f this amount i s guaranteed as i t 
corresponds to the consolidated budget approved for 2008. The gap o f US$460 million over 2009-1 1 w i l l 
be sought from external and internal sources, notably multilateral and bilateral donor assistance. The 
largest share o f the program i s for infrastructure (50 percent), followed by human capital development (19 
percent), good governance (1 1 percent), competitiveness (8 percent), social cohesion (7 percent), and 
cross-cutting issues, including gender and environment (5 percent). 

4.3 CAPE VERDE’S INTEGRATION IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY 

49. 

Cape Verde entered a Special Partnership Agreement (SPA) with the EU in November 2007 and 
acceded to the WTO in July 2008. The SPA focuses more on political dialogue, policy convergence on 
issues o f security, stability, migration and regional integration. 
I t i s distinct from the Economic 
Partnership Agreements that the EU i s seeking with signatories o f the Cotonou Agreement.39 Cape Verde 
expects that WTO accession w i l l attract higher levels o f FDI, strengthen domestic policies and institutions 
for the conduct of international trade for goods and services, enhance the ease and security o f market 
access to major export markets and provide access to a trade dispute settlement me~hanism.~’ Progressive 
liberalization o f the customs code by 20 18 will, however, imply lower customs revenues, which account 
for a sizable share o f tax revenues. In addition to these institutions, Cape Verde i s a member o f the 
African Union; the Economic Community o f West African States, with which i t coordinates t a r i f f 
policies; the Community o f Lusophone Countries, with which i t has established closer relations not only 
with Portugal but also with Angola and Brazil; and the Permanent Inter-State Committee to Fight Drought 
in the Sahel. W h i l e its main trading partners are EU countries, Cape Verde i s seeking greater South- 
South cooperation on both knowledge sharing and trade with nations ranging from Mauritius to China. 

V. WORLD BANK GROUP PARTNERSH IP STRATEGY 

5.1 LESSONS LEARNED AND K E Y PRINCIPLES FOR THE NEW PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 

50. 

The Bank’s FYO5-OS CAS was broadly implemented as planned and contributed to the 
envisioned outcomes in line with GPRSP objectives. The shift to increased budget support bolstered 
the reform program and strengthened country dialogue, donor coordination and harmonization. The 
portfolio included a good mix o f IDA investment operations that supported activities to complement the 
policy reform program supported by the PRSC ser ies and the AAA program that was implemented 
reflected CAS priorities (see Appendix 2). 

’’ Cape Verde i s a member o f the EU’s Cotonou partnership with 79 African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States. Since some o f 
the trade preferences under the partnership do not meet WTO requirements, the E U i s seeking to enter into EPAs with the ACP 
signatories. T h e EU i s hnd ing project in Cape Verde under the ‘Special Partnership’ out o f the €5 lm i l l ion earmarked for Cape 
Verde over 2008-13 under t h e 10th European Development Fund (EDF) -the funding part o f Cotonou. The EU has agreed that 
Cape Verde be a pilot for the EU’s new ‘Partnership fo r Mob i l i ty ’ . 
40 T h e need to introduce reforms relating to industrial and intellectual property rights explains the long duration o f the 
negotiations ( 9 years). I n recognition o f the economic impact that membership may have on the country, Cape Verde w i l l have 
un t i l 201 8 to meet all o f its WTO convergence targets which w i l l involve new legislation on commercial, customs and copyright 
law, and on health regulation. 

20 

5 1. 

The main lessons that the WBG can draw from previous strategies are that: 
I n light o f the pressing need for investment in infrastructure and the Government’s f i s c a l constraints, 
the WBG program should help Government to leverage financing for infrastructure via public-private 
partnerships. In the energy sector, which experienced a failed PPP, a new approach needs to be 
developed for the sector, namely one that promotes effective management and places greater 
emphasis on alternative, renewable sources o f energy. 
Some risks were not anticipated, such as the combination o f the failed PPP in energy, municipal 
arrears, and the weakness o f the regulator for the energy and water sector, which weakened Electra 
and created additional contingent liabilities for the State. 
The development partners should have a c lear strategy for building public and private capacity as 
weak capacity continues to present a constraint to effective implementation o f Government programs 
and private sector activities. 
The Government experienced difficulties preparing the MTEF and delays setting up the M&E system, 
although both were needed fo r better planning and monitoring o f GPRSP-I1 and o f CAS results. 
Given Cape Verde’s economic vulnerabilities, development partners, including the WBG, should 
continue to provide Cape Verde with access to concessional financing and maintain other special 
economic arrangements to help the country make a smooth transition to middle-income status and 
ensure that the development gains are not jeopardized. 
The joint budget support program has been very effective in advancing the reform agenda and 
coordinating donor support. The WBG should continue efforts to strengthen donor harmonization to 
ensure synergies and reduce transaction costs for Cape Verde’s Government. 
The Bank needs to have more direct outreach to non-government actors, including Parliament, civil 
society and the private sector. There i s also a need for greater responsiveness to Government’s 
requests for TA. 

52. 

The CPS will be guided by the principles o f selectivity, partnership, and a broadening and 
deepening o f the Bank’s relationship with a new M I C client. The selectivity o f the Bank’s support 
across and within sectors i s designed to achieve a more transformative impact. To this end, for example, 
the Bank w i l l assign its en t i re IBRD portfolio to the energy sector (see Section 5.3), and the International 
Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) are ready to 
support the sector as well. The Bank w i l l also seek partnerships with other donors with a view to 
ensuring continued donor coordination o f budget support under the auspices o f the Budget Support Group 
(BSG) o f donors, but also, where feasible, coordinated and harmonized support on sectoral investments. 
Moreover, with Cape Verde’s graduation to blend country status, the WBG w i l l offer a considerably 
broader menu o f technical and financial support, ranging from the ongoing IDA, AAA and trust fund 
support to include IBRD lending; an expanded IFC program for trade finance, SMEs and PPPs; MIGA 
and IBRD guarantees; new hedging products; specialized technical assistance, for example on debt 
management; and facilitation o f South-South Exchanges. Indeed, the WBG w i l l o f fe r more knowledge 
services designed to build capacity and inform policy dialogue in the country. TA such as that being 
provided by the Treasury Department could evolve into fee-based analytical and advisory services. 

5.2 CPS OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIC PRIORITIES 

53 . 

The Bank’s objective f o r this CPS i s to help the Government sustain high levels o f growth 
and reduce unemployment, poverty and inequality. To achieve these major results, the Bank would 
provide technical and financial support to: (a) promote good governance and public sector capacity; 
(b) improve competitiveness and the investment climate for private sector-led growth, and (c) strengthen 
human capital and social inclusion. These three areas are discussed in detail below and related indicators 
and areas supported by donor partners are detailed further in the results matrix in Appendix 1. 

21 

Strategic Priority One: Promoting Good Governance and Public Sector Capacity 

54 . 

This strategic priority i s aligned with Pillar I o f the GPRSP-II on Government Reform, and 
will focus on three CPS outcomes. These are: (1) reduced and better managed liabilities; (2) 
strengthened management o f public resources at cen t ra l and local levels; and (3) strengthened regulatory 
and oversight roles for the public administration. This pillar i s important as i t drives macroeconomic 
performance, the efficient use o f public resources and therefore also the success o f reforms in other areas. 
Moreover, progress in this area w i l l be essential as Cape Verde transitions to a M IC and also assumes 
greater responsibilities in light o f its integration in the WTO and i t s Special Partnership with the EU. 

CPS outcome 1. I : Reduced and better managed liabilities 

5 5 . 

The new PRSC series will continue to support macroeconomic and fiscal stability, a 
condition fo r sustainable growth. The ser ies w i l l support further clearance of past arrears according to 
the plan initiated in 2006 which ensures that no new arrears are created. I n addition, as Electra remains a 
major f isca l risk, a time bound action plan w i l l be articulated to clear the company’s arrears to suppliers. 
This w i l l complement work carried our by the IMF under the PSI, including support with macroeconomic 
monitoring. I n addition, the Bank can provide TA for contingency planning in light o f the country’s 
vulnerability to the impacts o f the global c r is is . Support would be coordinated with donors in the BSG. 

56 . 

To preserve debt sustainability and strengthen debt management, the Bank and the IMF 
will extend their technical assistance on debt management. A joint WB/IMF 
team undertook a Debt 
Management Performance Assessment exercise (DeMPA) and needs assessment in February 2009 and i s 
providing TA on the T-bill auction system. A medium term debt management strategy mission w i l l 
follow in April 2009 . The main goals are to improve the quality and transparency o f public debt statistics; 
assess the adequacy o f the legal and institutional framework fo r conducting and recording debt 
operations; ensure coordination between Treasury debt operations and the Central Bank’s monetary 
operations; perfect the T-bill auction and develop the domestic market for Government securities, 
including the choice o f software for the auctioning o f Treasury secur i t ies , and design and implement 
medium term debt strategy. 

CPS Outcome 1.2: Strengthened management of public resources at central and local levels 

57 . 

The PRSC series will support the implementation o f State reforms and o f the State 
restructuring plan, including greater decentralization, strengthened municipal management and 
merit-based civil service reforms. The Authorities have embarked on a government reform designed to 
improve good governance. Key elements o f the reform include the rationalization of government 
structures, modernization o f the public administration, transparency in the management o f public 
resources and decentralization for a leaner, more efficient and more effective public sector. The f i r s t 
phase o f implementation has started and i s progressing satisfactorily. By harmonizing ministerial 
s t ruc tu res and integrating the various governmental representations at the regional level, the Authorities 
now hope to better coordinate their activities and benefit from economies related to the streamlining o f 
structures. Decentralization o f responsibilities and resources to municipalities i s Cape Verde’s preferred 
means o f improving service delivery. Implementing a merit-based c iv i l service reform and increasing 
mobility within government and outside, and conducting careful analysis o f the f isca l impact o f the 
decentralization and new career and salary system, w i l l also be important. Support in these areas would 
be coordinated with other BSG members. 

22 

5 8 . 

Support f o r improved fiscal management and the comprehensive Public Financial 
Management (PFM) action plan will be provided primarily through the PRSC series. An update o f 
the PFM action plan w i l l draw on the 2008 PEFA results as well as the findings o f the latest CFAA 
evaluation and 2008 PER update, and on work done by IFC’s PEP-Africa in 2007 on drivers o f growth. 
The Bank may undertake a targeted PEWCPAWCFAA analysis to underpin the reform program. The 
key areas for increased focus include advancing on the public procurement modernization reform and 
implementing the new procurement code; oversight o f f isca l risk from public sector entities; ensuring the 
effectiveness o f audits; strengthening medium term budgeting and planning; advancing with the 
framework law on decentralization to ensure increased transparency in the trans fer o f funds, and 
enhancing PFM capacity at decentralized levels. This would be done in partnership with the donors on 
the BSG, who are supporting PFM in a coordinated way. For example, AfDB i s leading the work on 
budget planning and allocation, while the Spanish cooperation i s supporting the national procurement 
system, including the establishment o f the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (ARAP). 

CPS Outcome 1.3: Strengthened regulatory and oversight roles for the public administration 

59 . 

The Bank will provide operational support together with the PRSC series, in coordination 
with other donors, in order to strengthen technical capacity within the public administration. This 
support would include such areas as procurement, in te rna l audit skills in central Government as well as 
technical and managerial capacity at the municipal level. A Growth TA and SME Support operation i s 
proposed that responds to Government’s request to provide Cape Verde with support to articulate, design 
and implement reforms that promote good governance and efficiency. 

60. 

The Bank will contribute to strengthening a national monitoring and evaluation (M&E) 
system as well as statistical information and analysis. The national M&E system i s quite ambitious as 
i t i s designed to be an integrated national system covering a l l sectors that would enable government-wide 
monitoring o f outcome indicators for a l l projects/programs in a l l sectors. Progress has been made on the 
system but i t i s not yet fully functional. Given the importance and complexity o f the national M&E 
system, the Bank, along with the BSG, w i l l prepare a needs assessment on results-based management and 
M&E that should inform a comprehensive capacity building plan. The MCC i s also supporting the 
national M&E system. With regard to statistics, the Na t iona l Statistics Institute (known as N E ) ensures 
harmonization, integration and dissemination o f demographic and social statistics, and gathers scattered 
sectoral information to provide i t in a useful format to public and private agencies. 
I t oversees the 
Statistical Agenda, Cape Verde’s national statistical development plan, which i s progressing slowly. The 
Bank and the Swedish cooperation w i l l provide support to INE, in the Bank’s case with a particular 
emphasis on ensuring that data are available on key sectors that the Bank i s supporting, such as tourism 
and infrastructure. 

Strategic Priority Two: Improving Competitiveness and the Investment Climate fo r Private Sector- 
Led Growth 

61. 

This strategic priority i s aligned with Pillar III on competitiveness and Pillar IV on 
infrastructure o f the GPRSP-11, and will focus on tw o CPS outcomes. These are: (1) an improved 
business climate; and ( 2 ) improved access to and quality o f key economic infrastructure services. The 
two GPRSP-I1 pillars and the related CPS outcomes are at the core o f the country’s economic 
transformation agenda. Cape Verde’s infrastructure and basic services are also under pressure to meet the 
demands and opportunities o f the rapidly growing economy. 

23 

CPS outcome 2.1: Improved business climate 

62. 

The Bank will support policy and regulatory reforms to reduce business constraints, via the 
PRSC ser ies and the Growth T A and SME Support operation. The Government’s Casu do Cidudco 
has been extremely successful in launching four modules: (a) obtaining birth, death and marriage 
certificates; (b) creating a company in one day; (c) obtaining a unified automobile document; and (d) 
facilitating electronic payments. At the same time, further reforms are required to bring down the cost o f 
doing business and ensure effective, transparent, participatory and operationally cheap access to services. 
These could include Doing Business-related reform as well as trade restrictiveness reforms, such as 
streamlining Customs procedures further, or the careful design o f rationalized and focused tax incentives, 
drawing on the conclusions o f the recent Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS). The IFC designed 
the Millennium Challenge Corporation’s (MCC’s) Private Sector Development program, which w i l l be 
implemented by a public-private oversight body in Cape Verde and w i l l include components to strengthen 
local entrepreneurship, improve access to finance for SMEs, strengthen linkages in the tourism sector, and 
address other constraints to domestic investment. 
IFC w i l l directly implement the credit bureau 
component o f this initiative, and w i l l further seek to support local financial institutions expanding their 
business lending operations. 

63, 

Increasing competitiveness i n the financial sector, including by strengthening supervision 
and regulation o f banks, will support the private sector. Based on the findings o f the recent Financial 
Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) exercise, the Bank proposes to support a revision o f the microfinance 
law, help strengthen the off-shore banking regime and the Central Bank’s supervisory capacity, and 
enhance creditors’ rights to improve access to credit, including potentially by strengthening the rea l 
property registration code and registries. The instruments for this would include the PRSC series, the 
Growth TA and SME Support operation, which would also address access to finance issues for SMEs, 
and possibly a short term post-FSAP assistance task. Bank support w i l l be complemented by the IMF 
PSI’S focus on AMLKFT, for which new legislation has been adopted. 

64. 

Cape Verde needs to review and realign its tourism strategy to keep its destination 
competitive with other markets and supply a differentiated product. A comprehensive strategic 
vision (tourism master plan) i s a c r i t ica l first step. 
In addition, it w i l l be important to strengthen 
coordination among Government institutions around tourism activities and to adapt the regulatory and 
legal framework to attract high quality FD I and enhance local content. Another key concern o f the 
Government i s to strengthen linkages between the tourism industry and local communities, so as to 
increase domestic value added, create more jobs and extend benefits from this industry beyond the islands 
on which tourism i s concentrated at present. The Growth TA and SME Support operation could be used 
to provide support in some o f the above areas. 

65. 

Improving land management use i s critical not only fo r the tourism sector but also to 
address rapid urban expansion and environmental challenges. The Bank, along with Austria and 
Spain, w i l l support the Government in tackling constraints related to land by addressing land registration, 
ensuring effective legal protection o f property rights a t a reasonable cost (which i s essential fo r tourism 
investments and other FDI), and dealing with rapid urban growth. The implementation o f the new 
Cadastre Law and systematic planning on a l l islands represent decisive steps 
for ensuring 
competitiveness. Additional areas fo r development include enhancing the effectiveness o f rea l estate 
taxation and completing both municipal planning and island-level plans. This would help to address 
population growth, mobility, and urban expansion via improved land management and better planning o f 
infrastructure. The PRSC ser ies and the Growth TA and SME Support project provide the vehicles for 
policy dialogue and technical support on these issues . 

24 

CPS outcome 2.2: Improved access to and quality of key economic infrastructure services 

66. 

The CPS will contribute to easing infrastructure bottlenecks in tw o key areas, namely 
energy and water on the one hand, and transportation, with a focus on roads, on the other. The 
dedication o f the entire IBRD envelope under the CPS to the energy sector i s intended to achieve a 
significant breakthrough in the sector. Similarly the assignment o f further resources to the road sector, 
building on an ea r l ie r operation and its additional financing, i s intended to complete the sustainable 
upgrading o f the core road network and focus on integration o f that network with sea and a i r transport. 
The IFC has previously financed the mobile telecommunications sector, and w i l l seek to expand financing 
to this and other infrastructure areas, notably energy, that are being developed by the private sector. 

67. 

The Government and Electra plan to increase power generation capacity significantly, and 
the Bank would support this while also supporting stronger management and regulation o f the 
sector. The additional generation capacity required presently i s estimated at about 30 megawatts, which 
i s equivalent to 3 5 percent o f installed capacity. This i s needed fo r reliable coverage for households as 
well as for the manufacturing and hotel industries, I T services and cold storage fac i l i t ies . 
Investment 
lending by IBRD w i l l support Electra’s financial recovery and modernization and support its business 
plan and investment program, including new investments in renewable energy, notably wind and hydro 
power; as well as water and sanitation services. A Partial Risk Guarantee from IBRD would be used to 
attract investors to invest in renewable energy, including the ongoing windmill parks project. IFC has 
financed an analysis o f potential private wind power projects, and would be able to finance viable projects 
emanating from these e f for ts , provided the sectoral imbalances are also corrected. 
IFC envisages 
potential financing to private power production projects. As the Bank budget support shifts to the 
infrastructure and private sector development agenda, the CPS w i l l seek to promote a stronger regulatory 
framework for energy and water pricing and related measures. The Bank w i l l continue to support major 
reforms through ongoing policy dialogue under the PRSC instrument and TA. The Public-Private 
Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) i s supporting the preparation o f energy sector development 
policy and techn ica l assistance to the Economic Regulation Agency, ARE, for i t to facilitate sustainable 
public-private partnerships. Further TA i s being provided to prepare a strategy for Electra’s financial 
recovery. The AfDB i s providing complementary assistance through i t s electricity project on Santiago. 

68 . 

I n transport, the Bank’s focus will be on effectively implementing the Additional Financing 
fo r the ongoing road sector support project and preparing a new transp,ort sector operation. The 
la t ter operation w i l l complete the core road network, while the prioritization o f additional roads for 
investment would be based on (a) potential for enhancing tourism opportunities for the main roads, and 
(b) providing access to poor and isolated communities (based on population densities) for the rural/ feeder 
roads network using a least-cost approach.41 The transport operation w i l l also build institutional capacity 
for maintenance, and assess the multi-modal transport system and inter-island logistics planning capacity. 
With most external trade passing through sea ports, the economy i s critically dependent on intermodal 
transport. Coordination between air, sea (ferry) and road transport needs to be assessed to identify the 
bottlenecks to be removed in support o f tourism and inter-island connectivity and travel. A stronger 
capability in supply chain management and transport logistics may help boost manufacturing 
competitiveness, both at the level o f the firm and the economy. A logistics study, possibly funded by the 
PPIAF, w i l l be prepared to inform future work in this area. In addition, the PRSC se r ies w i l l support 
policy reforms that ensure the sustainability o f transport sector investments, such as ensuring that the road 
maintenance fund i s fully established and adequately financed. The ongoing IDA growth and 
competitiveness project w i l l continue providing technical assistance for the privatization o f ENAPOR, the 
Port Management Company, and TACV, Cape Verde’s National Airline. Improving port management i s 

4 ’ Data from the census and the poverty map would be used to assess where to invest in roads by taking in to account not only 
population density and poverty, bu t also the economic and social potential o f various types o f investments. 

25 

essential to enhance the economic performance o f the transport chain which in Cape Verde nearly always 
involves maritime transport. The Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) and Luxembourg are 
supporting the transport sector as well. 

69. 

The CPS will support the Authorities in reassessing options in the fisheries sector. The FY07 
fisheries sector report noted that the potential o f the f i s h e r i e s sector i s limited and in most cases resources 
have been fully or over exploited. The proposed West Africa regional fisheries project w i l l aim at (a) 
strengthening fisheries governance, (b) reducing illegal fishing, and (c) increasing loca l value added from 
maritime resources. The sector report and the planned country strategic investment framework (CSIF) 
w i l l contribute to the analytical underpinning o f the country operation. Support on f i s h e r i e s i s also being 
provided by the Japanese Government. 

70. 

The CPS will ensure that the support for infrastructure takes due care o f the environment. 
To ensure that investments in infrastructure are consistent with a sustainable na tura l environment, in 
collaboration with other budget support donors, the Bank w i l l support the Authorities in developing a 
policy framework for an environmentally sustainable tourism strategy. Assessing transparency in the 
pricing, allocation and management o f public land i s also needed to safeguard the environment and f i s c a l 
assets, and could be supported, in conjunction with the tourism strategy, under the Growth TA and SME 
Support project. I n addition, in collaboration with other development partners, the Bank, through the 
TerrAfrica partnership, w i l l support the preparation o f a sustainable land and water management CSIF 
that w i l l identify priority areas for intervention. 

Strategic Priority Three: Strengthened Human Capital and Social Inclusion 

71. 

This strategic priority i s aligned with Pillar I1 on human capital and Pillar V on social 
cohesion o f the GPRSP-11, and will focus on tw o CPS outcomes. These are: (1) better alignment o f 
technical and vocational education and training (TVET) graduates’ skills with labor market needs, and 
(2) improved targeting o f public expenditures and specific programs. The two GPRSP-I1 pillars and the 
related CPS outcomes are fundamental to reduce unemployment and strengthen social cohesion by 
reaching vulnerable groups with effectively designed programs.42 

CPS outcome 3.1: Better positioning of the education and TVET sectors for labor market needs 

72. 

I n order to assist Cape Verde in developing a demand-driven T V E T system, the Bank will 
continue to supervise TVET activities supported by the Dutch Cooperation. The Dutch cooperation 
has entered into an agreement with the Bank to monitor a €9 million budget support grant over 2008- 
20 1 1. Activities w i l l aim at developing in-country institutional capacity to steer a broad TVET program, 
supplying training opportunities geared towards labor market demand, and ensuring that an employment 
observatory i s in place and produces reliable statistics. 

73. 

The Tertiary Education in Africa Team (TE IA ) will support Cape Verde to increase access 
and equity at the tertiary education level. TEIA’s support w i l l focus on strategic priority disciplines 
for the country’s development and develop short term professional training that meets the labor market’s 
needs, while also addressing the sustainable development o f the overall sub-sector. The TEIA w i l l 
undertake an assessment o f the tertiary education sub-sector, focusing on financing and equity aspects and 
simulating the costs and sustainability o f different policy options, so as to inform a policy dialogue on 
developing a sustainable and efficient tertiary education sector in Cape Verde. 
I t w i l l also share 
knowledge through Cape Verde’s participation in workshops like the one scheduled for April 2009 on 

42 Cape Verde’s objective i s to reduce current unemployment rate o f 18 percent to l e s s than 10 percent in 2012. This w i l l require 
the creation o f 12,000 jobs per year in different areas o f economic activity. 

26 

short-term professional tertiary education with other African countries. The TEIA could also support the 
development o f a center o f excellence43 in a priority sector, such as tourism, i f there were a clear vision, 
strong buy-in, and solid training experience to draw on for such an institution. This would require IDA 
financing and preliminary TA to help the identified institution to develop a solid business plan. 

CPS outcome 3.2: improved targeting for public expenditures and specific programs 

74. 

A t present, only a minority o f public resources that are intended to reach the vulnerable 
population actually reach them, so improved targeting i s e~sential.4~ The Authorities have requested 
Bank support to identify ways to better target their programs. Cape Verde i s one o f few countries in 
Africa where it may make sense to set up a proxy-means testing program, although geographic targeting 
using the poverty map that INE and the Bank constructed recently i s also a possibility. The Bank can 
support Cape Verde with TA to determine optimal targeting approaches for social programs and subsidies 
for poverty reduction, and help to develop practical administrative tools for implementing them.45 The 
Bank can also help the Authorities to investigate the feasibility o f implementing a conditional cash 
transfer program. S ince a poverty map has already been estimated for the country and alternative proxy- 
means testing strategies have been calibrated in preparing the Poverty Assessment, support for improved 
targeting could be provided via the PRSC ser ies . A common targeting system for multiple programs, 
ranging from utility subsidies to public works and minimum pensions, would bring down administrative 
costs for implementing the targeting mechanisms in relation to the outlays for the various programs. 

75 . 

An ongoing initial assessment o f the labor market could lead to more in-depth and policy- 
focused advice on specific labor market constraints. An initial assessment o f the labor market i s 
currently examining the issue o f misalignment between recent unemployment and GDP growth rates, 
which point to a labor-skills mismatch. I t aims to understand labor market dynamics in key sectors o f the 
economy, paying special attention to the demand side and drawing on a new enterprise survey. This 
work i s also intended to provide the Authorities with the tools to monitor and evaluate the labor market 
outcomes o f the new labor law. Follow-on work could help the Authorities to address the issue o f 
strengthening human capital or other priority areas in relation to labor. 

76. 

The Bank Group’s support fo r energy, water, transport and competitiveness will not only 
address growth and efficiency issues but also pay attention to the social inclusion o f underserved 
groups. For example, the transport sector project would finance rehabilitation o f the rura l roads network 
to support access to employment and marketing opportunities for rura l residents; the proposed energy and 
water sector support would address tariff and coverage issues with a view to improving access for 
underserved groups; a key objective o f the proposed Growth TA and SME Support project would be to 
increase opportunities for SMEs, and the IFC’s PEP-Africa has designed a tourism linkage program to 
enhance opportunities for ru ra l areas. One component, a marketing and reservations service for small, 
independent lodging operators, i s currently being implemented with 3 5 firms participating. Thus there i s 
an explicit aim to draw on the operations in the pipeline to promote social inclusion even as they address 
growth and efficiency issues. 

77 . 

The Bank will also finalize the implementation o f tw o operations in June 2009 with strong 
social inclusion dimensions. The f i r s t i s the IDA-supported HTV/AIDS Additional Financing, which has 

4 3 The 2iE (international institute o f water and environmental engineering) i n Burkina Faso i s a good example o f this k ind o f 
support. 
44 Source: draft Poverty Assessment for Cape Verde, 2009, based on QU IBB data. 
4 5 The Poverty Assessment currently under implementation w i l l provide an asset-based poverty trend and profile analysis that 
compares the 2001 and 2006 surveys; assess qualitative perceptions o f poverty by the population; analyze basic trends i n 
education, health, and employment indicators; and, drawing on a new 2008 survey, examine trends in monetary poverty and the 
links between growth and poverty reduction, with a focus on the impact o f the tourism boom. 

27 

focused on outreach to vulnerable populations to increase awareness, as well as on the provision o f anti- 
retroviral treatment for persons living with W / A I D S - C a p e Verde’s successful application to the 
Global Fund for support w i l l ensure some continuity in that regard. The second i s a JSDF-funded grant 
fo r access to justice for vulnerable women. With a view to promoting social equity more broadly and 
gender equity in particular, this project has developed 11 “Legal Centers” on various islands to provide 
one-stop legal services including legal advice and rapid peaceful solutions to everyday disputes. 

5.3 DELIVERING THE CPS PROGRAM 

7 8 . 

The indicative I D A 15 envelope f o r Cape Verde i s SDR27 million, equivalent to US$40 
million, and the first year o f I D A 16 (FY12) i s taken to be in line with I D A 15. On this basis, the 
overall indicative IDA envelope for the CPS period i s estimated at US$51.5 million.46 I f Cape Verde 
participates in the Regional Fisheries Project, the country IDA allocation o f US$1.5 million .would 
leverage an additional U S $ 3 million from the regional allocation for this project, and an additional 
US $ 1 . 5 million from the GEF, for a total investment o f US$6 million. There w i l l be some front-loading 
or back-loading o f the IDA15 envelope across years since new IDA commitments are expected to be 
concentrated in FY 10. 

7 9 . 

Cape Verde will also access IBRD resources during the CPS period. In October 2007 the 
Bank established that Cape Verde i s creditworthy for IBRD lending. On this basis, Cape Verde w i l l be a 
blend borrower, accessing both IBRD and IDA financing under this CPS.47 The ceiling on IBRD 
commitments during the four-year CPS period has been se t a t U S $ 5 4 million. Cape Verde intends to 
draw on the IBRD financing envelope as follows: (a) a US$41 million energy investment operation; and 
(b) a US$11 .8 million IBRD guarantee for the wind farm electricity. The IBRD resources w i l l be 
contingent upon continued satisfactory performance o f economic management 
indicators 
(macroeconomic management, f isca l policy, and debt policy) o f the CPIA. The proposed pipeline i s 
presented in Table 3. S ince the new IBRD support complements an increased IDA program, the Bank 
w i l l be dedicating additional administrative resources to deliver the expanded program for Cape Verde. 

80. 

The Bank will concentrate its financial resources in selected areas within the three pillars o f 
the CPS so as to achieve transformative change. This implies focusing resources in a sector over time 
until a transformation point i s reached beyond which the sector i s elevated irreversibly to a higher 
functioning level. For example, the full IBRD envelope o f US$52.8 million w i l l be assigned to the 
critical energy sector and build on previous assistance in that sector in order to support decisive change. 
The PRSC ser ies o f around US$10 million per year over four years w i l l focus on governance and 
competitiveness reforms and build on the previous PRSCs and the ongoing Growth and Competitiveness 
operation in order to reinforce this priority area. New IDA-and GEF-financed investment projects 
totaling US$13 million over the next four years w i l l also address governance and competitiveness 
reforms, as well as bolster support through the ongoing Road Sector operation so as to achieve 
transformative change via continuing and enhanced support to the transport sector. A f i s h e r i e s operation, 

46 The actual I D A allocation for Cape Verde may vary annually on the basis o f (a) the country’s performance as assessed via the 
Country Policy and Institutional Assessment indicators and the performance o f the Bank’s portfolio in Cape Verde; (b) the 
country’s performance relative to the performance o f other I D A countries; (c) overall resources available to I D A during the 
IDA16 replenishment period; (d) changes i n the list o f active IDA-eligible countries, and (e) lending terms for which Cape Verde 
qualifies under the ID A 15 grant eligibility and allocation framework. Any fluctuations in the annual I D A allocations w i l l be 
reflected i n an adjustment o f financing for either budget support or investment operations. Incremental additional resources that 
may become available would be used to top up investment operations or, i f warranted, to alleviate external shocks. 
4 7 Cape Verde met two o f three criteria fo r M IC status, namely the cut-off for the country’s income per capita (estimated at 
US$2,130 in 2006) and the Human Assets Index (level o f human development), but Cape Verde lags on the third criterion, 
namely the Economic Vulnerability Index (EVI). 

28 

which draws on ea r l ie r A A A in the f ishe r ies sector, would strengthen governance, efficiency and 
sustainability in the sector as part o f a regional initiative. The proposed program o f lending builds on an 
existing well-performing portfolio o f three operations totaling US$48 .5 m i l l ion that i s well-aligned with 
the CPS objectives. W i th the I D A and IBRD envelopes already determined, the timing o f delivery o f the 
Bank support and the m ix between budget support and investment operations w i l l be the key tools that the 
Bank w i l l have at i t s disposal to adjust to changing economic and social conditions in the country.

Trust funded activities will be an important part o f the Country Partnership Strategy. 
There are currently five active t r u s t funds in the portfolio for a total o f just over US$6 m i l l ion o f which 
US$3 .7 m i l l ion remain to be disbursed. They include support to the Supreme Audit Institution; T A for 
energy and water; support to public-private infrastructure, and access to legal services, and they are 
therefore closely aligned to the strategic objectives o f the Bank’s strategy. Additional support w i l l be 
sought from such sources as the Institutional Development Fund, the Public-Private Infrastructure 

29 

Advisory Facility and the GEF. Resources w i l l be used strategically to enhance Cape Verde’s access to 
WBG support and w i l l be brought to bear in particular on: (a) capacity building activities in the area of 
debt and asset management; (b) facilitating policy dialogue and capacity building in other areas in which 
the Bank does not have a lending operation, fo r example higher education, or in which there are 
insufficient lending resources for capacity building, e.g. FSAP follow-up or tourism. In each case, the 
Bank w i l l pay attention to t h e cost-efficiency o f managing the t r u s t funds. 

5.4 

I F C AND M I G A ACTIVITIES 

83. 

The International Finance Corporation’s current investment portfolio in Cape Verde i s 
limited, with a total o f US$8 million in investments in the telecommunications and banking sectors. 
Going forward, the IFC Strategy w i l l focus on opportunities to improve financing options for SMEs in 
Cape Verde, and public-private infrastructure projects. I n SME finance, IFC w i l l expand current trade 
finance and credit lines with Caixa Econdmica, to other interested commercial banks. IFC w i l l also 
explore the potential for other instruments to support increased access to credit for SMEs through the 
banking sector, such as portfolio guarantees. In infrastructure, IFC has been active in financing the 
expansion o f ce l lu lar telephone networks, the main infrastructure sector attracting private investment. 
IFC w i l l also seek to provide advisory assistance to the Government in structuring public-private 
partnership and concession arrangements in key sectors. IFC’s PEP-Africa program, in coordination with 
IDA, has prepared a ser ies o f studies on the priorities for developing five key sectors for the economic 
transformation agenda (SMEs, finance, fisheries, maritime transport and tourism). This work was 
undertaken to assist the Government and private sector in designing the private sector component o f the 
US-financed MCC, which signed a U S $ l 00 million Compact with Cape Verde in 2005. 

84. 

The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (M IGA ) does not currently have any 
exposure in Cape Verde. Nevertheless, MIGA i s prepared to provide guarantees for private-sector led 
investments in infrastructure and to provide TA and advisory services to Cape Verde to s truc ture public- 
private partnerships that are sustainable. 

5.5 PARTNERSHIPS AND HARMON IZAT ION W I TH DONORS 

85 . 

Budget support has catalyzed donor harmonization around key policy measures and results 
in Cape Verde. I n April 2005, a “Partnership Framework between Budget Support Partners and the 
Government o f Cape Verde for the Provision of Budget Support” was signed between the Government, 
IDA, the EU and the nether land^.^' Under this Partnership Framework, the Government and donors 
agreed to: (a) harmonize indicators and prior actions for budget support; (b) undertake joint reviews o f 
budget support, and (c) synchronize budget disbursements with the Government’s budget cycle in order to 
reduce the transaction costs o f such assistance to the Government. With this agreement, which reflects 
Government’s ability to coordinate donors around a key agenda, the Government and partners began to 
institutionalize e f f o r t s to harmonize budget support for GPRSP implementation. S ince its inception, the 
Austrian Development Agency, Portugal, the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation, and the 
African Development Bank have joined the Partnership Framework (see Table 5) . The bi-annual reviews 
around a jo in t , streamlined matrix that forms the basis fo r discussions and disbursements in the donors’ 
respective operations have greatly reduced transaction costs for the client. The proposed PRSC-5, 
embedded in a three-year matrix that w i l l be agreed with the authorities and donors, i s being identified in 
consultation with various stakeholders under Government’s leadership. 

4 8 Cape Verde’s major bilateral donors a r e Austria, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, China, Portugal and the U.S.A. The EU, 
ADB , UN, IMF and World Bank are the major multilateral partners.

The Bank’s coordination with donor partners extends beyond the BSG, however overall , 
donor coordination could be strengthened further. F o r example, the B a n k and the M C C p r o v i d e

6.1. MONITORING 
AND EVALUATING THE BANK’S PORTFOLIO 

87. 

The Bank has had a good quality portfolio o f operations in Cape Verde. Four out o f the five 
projects that exited during FY05-08 had satisfactory outcomes, and a l l three operations in the portfolio as 
o f February 1, 2009 , (totaling U S $ 4 8 . 5 million) are rated satisfactory, with no flags for  problem^.^' The 
las t independent procurement review rated the three projects currently in the portfolio as moderately 
satisfactory on procurement. To improve portfolio management, the Bank intends to conduct 
procurement clinics so as to strengthen capacity within the country. Financial management ratings for the 
operations are also rated above the line and considered generally satisfactory. 

6.2. MONITORING 

AND EVALUATING RESULTS 

88 . 

The Government i s designing an integrated approach fo r monitoring and evaluating the 
GPRSP-II?’ The approach, which i s s t i l l under development, includes: (a) integrating the budget and 
financial management system with the technical aspects o f programs and service delivery; (b) developing 
a unified technological platform through Cabo Verde Digital; (c) providing open access to the main data 
warehouses on national statistics, policies and projects; (d) refining the indicators, and (e) strengthening 
statistics and planning sector units within Ministries. The design i s advancing, although capacity 
weaknesses, low levels o f communication among stakeholders, and the need for f inanc ia l resources have 
to be addressed to ensure that the M&E system i s fully operational. 

89 . 

The implementation o f the Statistical Agenda i s advancing slowly, but a shortage o f 
resources means that data are incomplete on key areas o f Bank support and the INE i s 
underfunded f o r the 2010 census. INE i s the main provider o f data on employment, drawing on regular 
employment and household surveys. INE i s also the main source o f data on tourism and i s currently 
preparing a survey on tourists’ satisfaction with their visits. Statistics on infrastructure are incomplete 
and are not highlighted i n the Statistical Agenda, representing a challenge for the Bank. INE i s also 
preparing the Population and Housing Census for 2010 with insufficient funding for this critical activity: 
the census i s the foundation for a l l future surveys and for sector indicators, such as on education and 
health. Other key activities include implementing the second in-depth household budget and 
consumption survey (known as IDRF-2) to update the main poverty indicators. 

90. 

The Bank and donors will monitor the implementation o f the CPS through joint missions as 
well as through separate project supervision missions. The Results Framework w i l l be used to track 
intermediate indicators and measure progress toward higher level outcomes (see Appendix 1). The Bank’s 
Implementation Supervision Reports are an important element in monitoring and evaluating progress on 
the CPS as well. Annual Country Portfolio Performance Reviews w i l l provide a forum for aggregating 
indicators and raising issues on results and outcomes with the Authorities. 

6.3. ’ MAIN R I S K S AND MITIGATING MEASURES 

91. 

There are important risks to achieving the anticipated r e s u l t s under the CPS. They include: 

49 The operations are: a FY03 Growth and Competitiveness Project (US$14Sm); an FY02 HIV/AIDS Project with additional 
financing (US$14m), and an FY05 Road Sector Support Project with additional financing (US%20m). 
The National Poverty Committee i s the GPRSP Steering Committee that oversees the process. A Technical Secretariat for 
Development Assistance (STAD) under t h e General Direction o f Planning has day-to-day responsibilities fo r providing technical 
guidance, monitoring performance, and informing internal and external partners o f progress. 

32 

9 2 . 

A deepening and extension o f the global economic downturn, o r a subsequent return to 
higher food and fuel prices. The recent shocks and global economic slowdown pose a significant risk to 
economic growth and poverty reduction for Cape Verde. For example, growth estimates for Cape Verde 
fo r 2009 have virtually been halved over t h e past two months. Given the importance o f tourism receipts, 
FD I and remittances flows fo r Cape Verde’s economic growth, the Authorities w i l l need to further 
develop their policy options to respond to the risk o f contagion from the global financial slowdown. 
Factors that mitigate the risks related to the global c r i s i s include Cape Verde’s build-up o f sizable 
international reserves in recent years; i t s standing line o f credit with the Central Bank o f Portugal; i t s 
continued monitoring under the IMF PSI, its access to budget support from the Budget Support Group o f 
donors, including the Bank, and the country’s solid track record o f proactive economic management and 
timely adjustment to shocks. The Bank’s focus on the energy sector i s also intended to address one o f the 
major sources o f risk related to contingent liabilities, while post-FSAP support w i l l serve to address risks 
o f contagion to the financial sector. Nevertheless the risk remains substantial, and the Bank i s engaged in 
enhanced surveillance of key economic indicators-together with the IMF-in 
light o f the risks o f 
contagion. I n addition, the upcoming Poverty Assessment w i l l simulate the poverty impact o f the shock 
across different groups so as to identify further mitigation measures. W h i l e a repeat o f the sharp r i s e in 
food and fuel prices that occurred in 2008 i s l e s s likely in a deflationary context, it would pose a risk to 
Cape Verde as a net importer o f food and f u e l if i t were to reoccur. Cape Verde was able to address the 
shock fairly well in 2008 through i t s grain stocks, tax and safety n e t policies and other fiscally prudent 
measures. However an extended food or fuel price pressure could strain the f isca l situation and delay 
further poverty reduction, especially in rural areas. I n light o f these risks, the Bank intends to prepare a 
CPS Progress Report ea r l ie r than would normally be scheduled so as to be able to review and adjust i t s 
program as needed, especially i f unpredictable negative developments emerge. 

9 3 , 

Political climate and implementation o f reforms. The Government’s commitment to 
implementing structural reforms, particularly in infrastructure, i s critical to achieving the CPS outcomes. 
With the next Presidential and legislative elections slated for early in 2011 and with a more polarized 
political scene since the opposition MpD won a narrow majority o f municipalities in the May 2008 
municipal elections, i t i s likely that the windows o f opportunity for more difficult institutional reforms, 
e.g. in relation to Electra, are either in 2009 or e lse in the second h a l f o f 201 1 and in 2012. Cape Verde’s 
two leading parties, the governing PAICV and the MpD, have established a 14-member cross-party 
commission to build political consensus around those reforms that require a two-thirds majority in the 
National Assembly to become law, such as constitutional amendments, and this commission could also 
prove to be instrumental in seeking consensus on implementing key policy reforms and responding 
promptly to difficulties emerging from the global c r is is . However the political scene could lead to delays 
in such key initiatives. The Bank has therefore set realistic outcome indicators in the Results Framework 
that take the political calendar and context into consideration. 

94 . 

Contingent liabilities. There are risks o f contingent liabilities from a number o f areas, including 
from public or semi-public companies no t operating efficiently or being affected by the economic 
downturn. I n addition to the above mitigating measures fo r exogenous shocks, the CPS provides support 
to address these issues head on, 
including supporting Electra’s recovery and recapitalization, 
strengthening ARE and helping to identify sustainable PPPs, so as to reduce these risks to more moderate 
levels. 

9 5 . Weak capacity. Weak administrative capacity, the limited number o f techn ica l staff and high 
turnover o f senior staff in core ministries could pose a risk to the implementation o f the GPRSP-I1 and 
reforms supported by the CPS. To address this risk in the short term, the Budget Support partners are 
financing a combination o f capacity-building activities and technical support. Joint supervision missions 

3 3 

and c lose coordination with the Authorities have helped to ensure an adequate use o f funds. I n the 
medium term, the ongoing civil service reform program should moderate the risk by helping to build a 
better trained and more stable cadre o f staff under an appropriate pay structure. The Growth TA and SME 
Support operation and an IDF to strengthen M&E capacity w i l l complement ongoing actions to 
strengthen public sector capacity. 

96 . 

Decline in external concessional support. With Cape Verde’s graduation to M I C status in 
January 2008, donors may begin withdrawing concessional aid at a faster pace than foreseen which could 
r e s u l t in reforms slowing down, domestic spending increasing or commercial borrowing rising, both o f 
the la t ter increasing risk o f f isca l slippages. The Government has mitigated this risk by including only 
firm agreements rather than notional commitments on support in i t s current budget and medium-term 
framework. Through dialogue with development partners and the BSG, the Bank w i l l seek to moderate 
this risk further by supporting Cape Verde’s continued access to concessional financing and encouraging 
others to do the same. 

V I I I . CONCLUD ING R E M A R K S 

97 . 

Cape Verde has reached an important juncture in its development and the Bank’s 
partnership can make a clear difference. Since October 2007, Cape Verde has graduated to M I C 
status, entered a Special Partnership with the EU and joined the WTO. I t has established a path o f 
peaceful political transitions and prudent economic management and an open economy that have 
contributed to sustained high growth rates through 2008, with a major impact in terms o f poverty 
reduction. Cape Verde has also established a vision for i t s development, which i s one o f economic 
transformation, grounded in its unique geo-strategic, natural and cultural assets, and has embodied that 
vision in its GPRSP. However, as a small archipelago in the Sahel zone with limited mineral resources 
and an economy that i s highly dependent on FDI, remittance flows and tourism receipts, Cape Verde i s 
vulnerable not only to the severe droughts that have left their mark on i t s history, but also to the food and 
f u e l shocks that emerged last year and to the current global economic downturn. Moreover, it s t i l l faces 
an important agenda o f structural reforms in key sectors such as energy, transportation and public 
administration that ca l l for strong leadership. I t has also made very c lear that the economic growth must 
be socially inclusive and characterized by solidarity with the country’s most vulnerable population. There 
are important risks a t this time, even a f ter measures are taken to mitigate them, however there are major 
benefits associated with Bank partnership with Cape Verde as the country endeavors to advance on its 
economic transformation agenda and weather the volatile global economic context. Successful 
implementation o f the Bank-supported program, in partnership with other donors, can play a 
transformative ro le in key areas such as energy, roads, the business environment and public 
administration, while promoting social inclusion and orienting resources to protect and ass is t the poor.

REPUBLIC OF CAPE VERDE . 
2005 CAS COMPLET ION REPORT 

Country: Cape Verde 
Date o f CAS: January 27,2005 
Period covered by the CAS Completion Report: Ju ly 1 ,2004 - December 3 1,2008 

CAS Completion Report completed by: Joelle Dehasse, Sr. Operations O f f ice r 

Date: Ma rch 11,2009 

INTRODUCT ION 

1. 

This document discusses the r e s u l t s o f The W o r l d Bank’s Coun try Assistance Strategy (CAS) fo r 
Cape Verde dated January 27,2005 and cover ing FY05-08 . The repor t i s based on discussions with Bank 
s ta f f and Cape Verde o f f ic ia ls invo lved in or fam i l ia r with Bank-financed projects, a review o f various 
reports and pro jec t documents (aide-mbmoires, Imp lemen ta t ion Status Reports (ISR), Imp lemen ta t ion 
Comp le t ion Reports (ICR), Coun try Po l icy and Ins t i tu t iona l Assessments (CPIA) and field visits. 

2. 

Cape Verde i s an archipelago o f t e n islands located o f f the west coast o f A f r i c a with a popu la t ion 
estimated at 500,000, w i t h almost tw ice that number l i v i n g abroad, mos t ly in Europe and the Un i ted 
States, and accounting fo r significant remittance f lows to the country (1 1 percent o f GDP in 2006 and 9.2 
percent in 2007). Despite i t s small size and geographic challenges, Cape Verde has one o f t h e most 
successful economies in Sub-Saharan A f r ica . Fo l low ing a decade o f robust growth, the country graduated 
f rom the UN l i s t o f Least Developed Countries (LDCs) to a l o w Middle Income Coun try (M IC ) as o f 
January 2008.’ The country boasts a track record o f more than t e n years o f mu l t i -pa r ty democracy, 
peaceful po l i t ica l transitions and e f fec t ive par t ic ipa t ion o f c i v i l society in the governance process and 
macroeconomic stability. 

3. 

The country’s per capita income (GNI, A t las method) i s estimated at US$2,250 in 2007, bolstered 
by a fast g row ing services sector (ma in ly tourism, telecommunications and construction), good 
governance and successful pub l ic programs that have increased access to education and healthcare, 
pav ing the way fo r the country to meet a l l the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Cape Verde has 
made s ign i f ican t gains in reducing poverty, wh ich dropped f rom 49 percent in 1998 to 37 percent in 2002 
to 27 percent in 2007. 

4. 

Despite these gains, as with many island nations, Cape Verde i s h igh ly vulnerable to economic 
shocks no t on ly due to i t s sma l l size, but also to i t s loca t ion and geographic cond i t ion . Scarce natural 
resources and non-renewable energy sources, and the Sahelian climate, limit the country’s opportunities 
fo r expansioddiversification o f the produc t ion base and exports. D i f f i c u l t agr icu l tura l conditions and the 
almost inexistent manufacturing sector have been a ma jo r cause o f emigration and pover ty . 

I I n 2000, the UN concluded that Cape Verde would graduate from the Least Developed Country category in January 2008 based 
on satisfying two o f three criteria: the country’s income per capita and the Human Assets Index (level o f human development). 
However, on the third criterion, Economic Vulnerability Index (EVI), Cape Verde ranks poorly. 

5 . 

Notwithstanding these vulnerabilities, macroeconomic policy helped to mitigate the e f f e c t s o f 
high food and f u e l prices in early 2008, and the 2008 /09 global financial c r i s i s and recession were 
contained. 

A. 

CAPE VERDE’S LONG-TERM STRATEGIC GOALS 

6. 

The Government’s long-term strategic goals supported by the Bank’s 2005 CAS were articulated 
in the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (GPRSP) prepared in 2004. The GPRSP was based 
on ea r l ie r development strategies, notably Cape Verde’s National Development Plan (the Plan) and the 
Grand Options o f the Plan 2002-2005. These goals were expressed as follows: “to ra ise Cape Verdeans to 
a level o f income and quality o f l i f e that values their human dignity by means o f economic policies that 
guarantee sustained development, in a way that i s compatible from a social, regional and inter- 
generational standpoint, environmentally sustainable, and based on a growth standard built on increasing 
productivity gains; overall, a development which minimizes poverty and social exclusion and that may 
bring about equity and social justice.”* The Government put the focus o f the GPRSP on accelerating 
growth through reforms to make the country more competitive and to promote investments in 
in f ras t ruc tu re to attract private investments. Meanwhile, the Government also sought to find responses to 
stubborn poverty and growing inequity fo r those not benefiting from growth, particularly those living in 
ru ra l areas or not having skills for the services industry. The strategy focused on five key pillars for 
public intervention: (i) promoting good governance; (ii) improving competitiveness and private sector-led 
growth; (iii) fostering human capital development; (iv) strengthening social security and solidarity; and 
(v) improving infrastructure and land use management. 

7 . 

As stated in the GPRSP, the first pillar, good governance focuses on four objectives: (i) reform 
o f public administration, (ii) strengthening o f the judicial system, (iii) reform o f the State’s financial 
management system, and (iv) decentralization. 

8 . 

The second pillar, improving competitiveness and private sector-led growth, includes a 
number o f objectives and policy priorities, notably: improving labor policies, strengthening the labor 
market, and creating jobs; strengthening the ro le o f the State in the process o f privatizations, in particular 
with regard to economic regulation and legislation; developing adequate financing mechanisms fo r a 
small economy (notably micro-credit); strengthening the rural public works program (FAIMO) to 
continue providing emergency job opportunities, particularly in rural areas; pursuing the sustainable 
growth o f agriculture; ensuring food security; strengthening policies regarding the f i s h e r i e s sector; and 
implementing a strategic plan for tourism. 

9 . 

The third pillar, developing human capital, includes the objectives o f improving the education 
system and professional training; strengthening health systems and improving access o f the poor to health 
services; and increasing budget allocations to the health and education sectors. 

10. 

The fourth pillar, developing infrastructure, promoting land use planning and protecting the 
environment, includes putting in place more effective and sustainable transport systems within and 
between islands, covering a ir transport, land transport and maritime transport; strengthening basic 
infrastructure services, including energy, water and sanitation; and implementing the Second National 
Action Plan fo r the Environment T I (known as PANA 11).

2004. 

41 

1 1. 

The fifth pillar, improving the effectiveness and sustainability o f the social protection system, 
seeks improvements in the social security regimes in both the private and public sectors; reforms to 
ensure the financial viability o f the public sector’s pension program (to which workers do not contribute); 
support fo r workers that are injured on the job or f a l l ill; and social security for independent workers. 

12. 

The Government completed the preparation o f its second Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy 
(GPRSP-11) in May 2008. The GPRSP-I1 largely retains the same long-term strategic objectives as 
previously, though with greater emphasis on investing in infrastructure, including through private 
partnerships and human capital to help take advantage o f new opportunities and transform the economy. 

B. CAS OUTCOMES 

I. CAS Objectives 

13 . 

The Bank’s 2005 CAS to support Cape Verde’s GPRSP was discussed at the Board on February 
22, 2005. The CAS benefited from close consultations with Government, development partners, civil 
society and loca l communities during the preparation o f the GPRSP. The CAS identified two key 
challenges for Cape Verde: (i) growing demands on public funds for provision o f non-primary social 
services and soc ia l safety nets for the poorest; and (ii) building a competitive economy. Lending and non- 
lending support was planned around th ree pillars: (1) ensuring sound macroeconomic stability and sound 
public finance and budget systems; (2) enhancing the investment climate and increasing competitiveness 
through public-private partnerships (PPPs); and (3) implementing social programs to alleviate poverty 
and inequity. 

14. 

During the CAS period, IDA provided new commitments o f US$63 million (US $ 3 3 million from 
IDA 143). The CAS had projected a four-year base case lending program o f US$50 million and a 
proposed GEF grant o f U S $ 5 million. A high-case scenario estimated lending o f US$7 1 million; however 
this level o f lending exceeded the IDA resources available to the country, even with its strong portfolio 
and CPIA performance. Given the limited IDA financing envelope (averaging US$12.5 million a year), 
the CAS proposed to shift from providing mainly investment lending to providing a greater share o f 
financing as programmatic lending, or budget support, to be underpinned by annual public expenditure 
reviews. This was successfully implemented and created strong synergies and harmonization o f 
Government and budget support donors’ priorities. The Bank also moved forward with most o f the 
planned lending operations in the CAS, with a multi-sector infrastructure operation dropped and PRSC I V 
postponed to FY09 due to insufficient IDA resources. The Bank also did not complete ana ly t ica l work on 
the rural and soc ia l sectors, reflecting the shifting priorities during CAS implementation. The Bank’s 
CAS also projected to in f luence results in areas where the Bank did no t provide direct support (rural 
development, environment). The CAS performance overall i s Satisfactory and benefited from a relatively 
good global environment for Cape Verde during most o f the period o f the CAS and strong Government 
leadership. 

11. Progress toward CAS Objectives 

Pillar 1. Ensure macroeconomic stability and sound public finance and budget systems 

15. 
This CAS pillar i s aligned with the f i r s t two GPRSP pillars o f promoting good governance and 
improving competitiveness and private sector-led growth. Under this pillar, the Bank proposed to 
contribute to macroeconomic stability, modernizing government and strengthening public finance through 

This includes an additional allocation o f $2.6 m i l l ion equivalent o f IDA resources in FY08. 

42 

analytical work---including economic monitoring, Public Expenditure Reviews, review o f fiduciary 
systems, and an investment climate assessment--and programmatic and investment lending. 

16. 

17. 

The CAS proposed a ser ies o f Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs, programmatic loans) 
as the main lending vehicle to support improved budgeting and budget systems, focusing on public 
expenditure management, civil service reform, decentralization, and judicial reform. The Growth and 
Competitiveness Pro jec t supports the Government’s efforts to simplify procedures and enhance the 
investment climate. 
Four PRSCs were implemented from 2005 - 2008, through which the Bank played a key role i n 
bringing together a Budget Support Group o f donors to jointly finance GPRSP policy reforms. I n April 
2005, the Budget Support Group was launched with the first o f several “Partnership Frameworks” 
between donors (European Commission, the Netherlands and World Bank) and Government. By 2007, 
the Budget Support partners also included Austria, Spain and the African Development Bank. At the time 
that the CAS was approved, the Government had also entered into a three-year Poverty Reduction and 
Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement with the IMF for SDR 8.64 million, approved by the Executive 
Board on April 10,2002. I n September 2006, the Government entered into an agreement with the IMF on 
a medium-term economic program to be supported by a three-year non-disbursing Policy Support 
Instrument (PSI). Through the PRSCs, the Bank played a key role in mobilizing a coordinated donor 
approach to budget support and was able to support a broad range o f reforms envisaged in the GPRSP. 

18 . 

The key CAS outcomes, as stated in the .CAS results framework, and the progress made toward 
those outcomes with Bank support, are listed below: 

19. 

CAS outcome: Ensure macro stability and maintain debt sustainability: This outcome was 
to be achieved by maintaining an average per capita GDP growth o f at leas t 2 percent and keeping the 
f i s c a l deficit low. This outcome was surpassed and performance was highly satisfactory. Cape Verde 
continued to pursue sound macroeconomic policies during the CAS period, enabling the country to make 
up for slippages at the beginning o f the decade. Real GDP for the period 2005-2008 i s estimated to 
average 7.5 percent, peaking at 10.8 percent in 2006 (growth in 2008 i s estimated at 6.0 reflecting the 
worldwide slowdown). Real growth per capita has increased on average by over 5 percent, faster than 
most small islands and the average for Sub-Saharan Africa. The Government consolidated f i s c a l reforms 
and kept deficits low; however, i t s t i l l grappled with a tight budget with l i t t l e f i s c a l space and faced 
contingent liabilities due to difficulties in the energy sector. A debt sustainability analysis (DSA) prepared 
by the IMF and World Bank in June 2005 concluded that Cape Verde’s external debt levels appeared 
sustainable but would require a prudent approach to borrowing, consolidating f isca l reforms and 
strengthening debt management. A DSA carried out in December 2007 validated these conclusions. 
Under the 3-year IMF Policy Support Instrument, concurrent with the CAS period, a ceiling on annual 
borrowing and guarantees (in non-concessional terms) was agreed upon to ensure public debt 
sustainability . 

20. 

CAS outcome: Public expenditure management more transparent and oversight institutions 
empowered. Although the CAS did not propose specific indicators, this outcome was achieved and 
performance i s satisfactory. Public expenditure management has become more transparent as a result o f a 
number o f reforms supported by the Bank: 

43 

0 

Tax management: A new taxpayer registry and tax identification number, supported by a modern 
information technology (IT) system, were successfully put in placeO4 Government pursued tariff reforms 
initiated in 2004, including the introduction o f the VAT. 
Budget execution: 
The 2006 budget law included measures to strengthen f isca l transparency, 
including by reflecting petroleum subsidies and providing for the clearance o f 3 5 percent o f arrears. I n 
April 2006, o i l subsidies were eliminated. An “Integrated Financial Management and Information 
System (IFMIS)” i s now connecting a l l Government ministries, allowing them to monitor their accounts 
in r e a l time - a key achievement for the Government. 
0 Empowering oversight institutions: Two laws were prepared (an Organic Law o f the Inspector 
General o f Finances (IGF) approved in 2005 and an Organic Law o f the Court of Auditors (approved by 
the Council o f Ministers and submitted to Parliament in 2007). The Independent General Audit O f f ice 
(TdC) recruited consultants to enhance i t s capacity and a law to strengthen the TdC was prepared and 
approved by the Parliament in October 2007. 
0 E-government i s one o f Cape Verde’s most successful public sector reform initiatives o f the past few 
years and has significantly increased transparency and efficiency. Through NOSI (the Operational 
Nucleus for Information System, or Cabo Verde D ig i ta l as it i s commonly known), Government has no t 
only put in place the IFMIS, but also integrated the Government’s human resources database and payroll 
systems; installed financial management systems in the largest municipalities to boost revenues; helped 
revamp the tax registry and reengineered various administrative processes to make se lec t services 
available electronically through a “one-stop-shop” approach. The Bank has supported NOSI through the 
PRSCs as well as the Growth and Competitiveness Project. 

21. 

CAS outcome: Ensure that public expenditures are allocated and spent according to 
GPRSP priorities. This outcome was to be measured by the share o f budget allocated to key soc ia l 
sectors (health, education), as well as enhanced protection extended to vulnerable groups through 
increased share o f programs benefitting them and introduction o f cost recovery in social sectors based on 
ability to pay (see also CAS outcomes under P i l lar 3 in Table A2-1). This outcome was achieved and i s 
satisfactory. Government met its GPRSP budget allocations for health and education for 2005 through 
2008, even exceeding these in some instances (see Table A2-1). However, i t should be noted that these 
achievements were made despite the fact that annual budget laws were not adequately aligned with the 
GPRSP or the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). This was in part because the preparation 
o f the GPRSP and o f the MTEF for 2004-07 was initiated at the same time, and, as a result, the GPRSP 
was not based on the MTEF. Cape Verde’s MTEF provides projections for recurrent and investment 
budgets by a classification that does not match the administrative c lass i f ica t ion o f the budget nor the 
public investment programs. For example, MTEF projections for education and health deviated from 
GPRSP goals by 40 percent and 100 percent, re~pectively.~ International TA was provided across 
ministries to develop a global MTEF and sectoral MTEF during the CAS period. 

22. 

CAS outcome: Municipalities function in clarified framework matched by adapted 
resources. This outcome was partially satisfactory. As discussed in the 2008 PER, there i s s t i l l no c lear 
framework that delineates the ro les and responsibilities o f the loca l and the central governments. 
However, a loca l finances law passed by Parliament in 2005 was successful in increasing central 
Government transfers to municipalities from 7 to 10 percent. For some municipalities, particularly the 
smallest ones, central Government t rans fe rs represent up to 50 percent o f their income. To strengthen 
their financial management and communication, NOSI installed a Municipal Information System in 
twelve municipalities. The PRSCs supported the decentralization agenda to help Government clarify the 
responsibilities o f municipalities and funding issues, but without significant progress. Discussions on a

draft decentralization law were ongoing for several years without resolution due to the absence o f 
consensus. The decentralization law was dropped as an ac t ion to be completed under the PRSC series. 

23. 

CAS outcome: Improved ability to manage public sector reform across institutions. N o 
indicator was proposed but this outcome was partially achieved and performance i s partially satisfactory. 
The Government established the Ministry for the Chairmanship o f the Council o f M in is te rs , State Reform 
and Defense, with a specific mandate o f strengthening public sector reform across Government 
institutions. The Unit for the Coordination of Reforms (UCRE) was created under this ministry, with 
representatives from a l l sector ministries, to prepare an overall framework for coordinating reform efforts 
across institutions. NOS I ’s work has also helped improve coordination by integrating administrative and 
financial tools, such as with the IFMIS and integrated human resources database and payroll. 

24. 

One o f the key risk concerns o f the CAS was the issue o f contingent liabilities, particularly from 
loss-making enterprises. In addition to supporting PPPs in an effort to reduce the burden on the State, the 
Bank supported Government efforts to better track autonomous institutions and the potential for liabilities 
to arise. The Ministry o f Finance created a unit charged with tracking State participation in companies. 
Autonomous institutes and ministries were a l l linked through the integrated online financial management 
system (SIGOF), enabling the Budget and Treasury units to better follow budget execution and take 
measures to prevent liabilities from being passed on to the cen t ra l Government. The authorities are also 
compiling the consolidated balance sheet of five state-owned enterprises (ASA, TACV, ENAPOR, 
Electra and IFH) and detailing their debt by maturity, currency, residency, and state guarantees, which 
w i l l be submitted to the Council o f Ministers by March 2009. 

25. 

CAS outcome: Framework to manage and train civil servants to be better adapted to 
modern administration. This outcome was to be measured by the number o f public sector managers in 
place and the number o f civil servants trained. However, this indicator does not seem consistent with the 
more modest outcome o f establishing a framework, which was achieved. Performance i s considered 
moderately satisfactory. The establishment o f the human resources database and its integration with 
payroll i s considered a major achievement toward civil service reform. The Government i s 
deconcentrating access to the database, currently only available at the central level, to five ministries. 
The Career and Salary System i s being revised and a report has been prepared proposing options for how 
to better manage human resources. A draft Basic Law on Civil Service was approved by the Council o f 
Ministers in January 2008 following consultations with labor organizations. 

Justice sector 

26. 

As part o f e f for ts to modernize government under this pillar, the Bank also sought to help address 
weaknesses in the justice system, a key element o f the GPRSP Pillar 1 to strengthen governance and 
P i l la r 5 to strengthen social protection. The Bank’s support in this area was largely implemented through 
two grants, a US$364,702 IDF grant to strengthen the r u l e o f law which became effective in December 
2003, and a US$954,460 JSDF grant to support access to legal services fo r vulnerable groups including 
women, approved in mid-2004. The PRSCs, the Growth and Competitiveness project and the first 
GPRSP Trust Fund (prior to the CAS) also supported initiatives in this sector. CAS outcomes, and 
progress toward those outcomes, were mixed, and are listed below: 

27. 
CAS outcome: Improved adherence to and knowledge o f the law in law communities. This 
outcome was achieved and performance i s satisfactory. There were a number o f activities undertaken with 
Bank support to strengthen knowledge o f the law, including: training and a study tour for 12 Cape 
Verdean judges which instilled greater support for soc ia l justice initiatives and led to working groups that 
set out to create small claims courts. Twenty-three mediators were trained and accredited on how to 

45 

apply a mediation law approved in 2004, allowing small conflicts to be mediated rather than languish in 
the official jus t ice system. The training also gave mediators the skills needed to run the Casus de Direito 
(legal centers) se t up to provide legal services to the poor; however, these legal centers were slow in being 
established and operational. The Ministry o f Justice compiled a l l Supreme Court decisions dating back to 
1994 on a CD-ROM for distribution to the legal community. The Institute for Women’s Condition (IWC) 
received training on advocacy for women’s legal protection and rights, and organized a ser ies o f training- 
of-trainers events for NGOs that advocate for women. The IWC also trained judges on gender sensitivity. 
However, a legal education program that was created specifically to provide sustainable training for 
aspiring legal professionals, and which would have made an important contribution to this outcome, was 
never launched. (See alsoparagraph 42 on new arbitration law). 

28. 

The digitalization process and the database o f the Official Gazette are complete. The Imprensa 
Nacional (National Printing, INCV) started on August 24, 2006 in an experimental phase, publishing on 
the Web the Official Gazette (www.incv.qov.cv). Today it i s possible to access a l l numbers published in 
2006 and to search the database. This means that users have access to a l l legislation published. INCV, in 
collaboration with NOSI, developed a project that w i l l expand the aforementioned possibilities to cover 
a l l the published legislation since Independence (1975). This activity was supported by the Growth and 
Competitiveness Project. 

29. 

CAS outcome: Increased free access to justice system by the poor. This outcome was to be 
measured by the number o f poor women benefiting from j u s t i c e services; however, this indicator could 
not be measured in part due to the significant delays with activities supporting this objective. 
Nonetheless, the outcome was achieved and performance i s moderately satisfactory. The Casus de 
D i re i to , legal centers for the poor with a particular focus on helping women, were a key instrument 
proposed by the Bank to support this outcome, supported with JSDF financing, but activities were 
significantly delayed initially. However, significant progress was made in 2007 and 2008 A l l agreements 
between municipalities and the 11 proposed legal centers were eventually signed in the f i r s t half o f 2008, 
and 7 o f the legal centers were operational by the second ha l f o f 2008. Six o f the cen ters have been 
providing f r e e legal advice to targeted communities in 3 islands, 6 outreach paralegals have been trained, 
and 28 community leaders have been trained in basic legal knowledge o f domestic violence, family and 
labor law. There have been some 40 training sessions for loca l villages and communities in legal literacy 
and 10,000 leaflets with information on the legal centers and their services have been distributed. With 
Bank support, the Ministry o f Justice, working with NOSI, created a database to monitor access to justice 
for the poor in Cape Verde. 

30. 

CAS outcome: Improved supply o f professional mechanisms such as mediators. This 
outcome was to be measured by the number o f mediators trained and number o f disputes resolved. The 
outcome was achieved and performance i s satisfactory. As discussed previously, the Bank supported the 
training o f mediators (see paragraph 27). Other important results were the promulgation o f a decree-law 
on mediation and a law on arbitration. These laws established new alternative dispute resolution 
mechanisms (ADR) for legal claims o f private citizens and business entities in Cape Verde and helped to 
reduce the burden on the country’s courts. The number o f disputes resolved has not been tracked. 

Pillar 2: Support private sector-led growth through enhanced investment climate and increased 
competitiveness through public-private partnerships in infrastructure 

3 1. 

This pillar i s aligned primarily with the GPRSP pillars I1 and I V whose objectives are to promote 
competitiveness and private sector-led growth, human capital and infrastructure services.

T h e k e y C A S outcomes, as stated in the C A S resu l ts f ramewo rk , and the progress made t ow a r d 
those ou tcomes with B a n k support, are l i s t e d b e l ow : 

34. 

CAS outcome: Complete the divestiture program by 2005. 
This ou tcome was t o be 
cons idered ach ieved i f the p r i v a t i z a t i o n o f T A C V , E N A P O R and E M P R O F A C we re comp le ted . These

A managemen t con trac t f o r T A C V was i n i t i a t e d o n December 5, 2006 and i t s achievements 
(increased e f f i c i e n c y and savings, n e w c omm e r c i a l agreements, c o n t r o l o f overhead costs and sale o f non-

a i r l i n e has n o t been p r iva t ized . 

36. 

E N A P O R was also n o t p r iva t ized . In 2006, the consu l t ing firm o f B o o z A l l e n H am i l t o n was h i r e d 
t o p r o v i d e assistance with the process, but did n o t comp le te this w o r k . A n e w p r i v a t i z a t i o n adv iso r was

37. 

T h e p r i v a t i z a t i o n process o f E M P R O F A C was preceded by e f f o r t s t o es tab l ish a regu la tor . A 
f o o d and pharmaceu t ica l regu la t ing agency (ARFA) was set up in Oc tober 2004 and the agency began 
opera t ions in September 2005. As o f end 2008, AFRA was w o r k i n g on es tab l ish ing a sustainable funding

38 . 

CAS outcome: Improved interface between public and private sectors. This ou tcome was t o 
b e measured by the comp le t ion o f an ac t ion p l a n t o reduce adm in is t ra t ive barr iers . This ou tcome was

3 9 . 

T h e f i n a n c i a l system has been r a p i d l y modern ized . 
T h r o u g h ’ t h e c om b i n e d e f f o r t s o f the 
Governmen t , the Cen t ra l B a n k o f Cape Verde , the comme rc ia l banks and the Chambers o f Commerce ,

and the f i n a n c i a l ma rke t has s i g n i f i c a n t l y deepened. E l e c t r o n i c b a n k i n g has been qu i te successful as 
demons tra ted by the measurable increase in t h e v o l um e o f transactions t h r o u g h A u t om a t i c T e l l e r 

47 

Machines (ATM), available on a l l the islands, and Point o f Sale (POS). To date, 62 ATM and 475 Point 
o f Sale (POS) machines serve more than 88,000 issued e lec tron ic debit cards. The period from December 
2005-2006 saw an increase in the value o f ATM transactions by 29.3 percent and o f POS transactions by 
72 percent. 

40. 

CAS outcome: Transaction costs are reduced and contribute to improved supply chains. 
This outcome was to be considered achieved if at least three value-added services were introduced during 
the CAS period. This outcome was achieved and performance i s satisfactory. With the improvements in 
information technology used by the civil service, including customs and other departments, many 
transaction costs have been reduced, both i n financial and administrative terms, contributing to improved 
supply chains. Electronic VISA was introduced in Cape Verde in December 2004 and significantly 
facilitated the development o f tourism and the increase o f foreign exchange flows in to the country. As o f 
June 30, 2007, (a) a l l o f the islands have access to VISA through the ATM or Points o f Sale; (b) there 
were more than 135,000 transactions in 2006 and within another six months, more than 250,000 
transactions had taken place with transaction value totaling some €25 million (US$32 million equivalent). 
A l l commercial banks issue credit cards. 

4 1. 

CAS outcome: Property rights are strengthened and legal framework facilitates rapid and 
fair dispute resolution: N o indicator was provided for measuring property rights and the Bank’s 
involvement in this area was minimal. That said, a key step toward strengthening property rights was the 
preparation o f a draft Land Cadastre Law which was finalized in 2007 and sent to the Council o f 
Ministers for approval before being submitted to Parliament for enactment. I n addition to an extensive 
program o f topographical naming o f mountains, valleys, rivers, bays, etc., a second program i s focusing 
on modernizing registry offices. Beginning in early 2008, a new five-year project w i l l support the 
establishment o f land registry offices in a t least 17 Cape Verde municipalities. Donor funding o f at leas t 
US$2 million w i l l be needed to assist with the hiring and training o f s t a f f and the acquisition o f relevant 
equipment. These activities were indirectly supported by the Growth and Competitiveness Project. 

42. 

Another achievement i s the enactment o f Cape Verde’s Arbitration Law which went into effect in 
August 2005. Numerous arbitrations have since taken place to resolve disputes. S ince 2005, contracts 
between the Government and private sector typically include a clause that requires arbitration in the event 
o f any dispute. 

43. 

CAS Outcome: Adequately functioning Economic Regulatory Agency (ARE). This outcome 
was achieved and performance i s moderately satisfactory because ARE suffered some delays and 
difficulties in fulfilling its mandate. 
I n 2003, 
the Government established the Agdncia de 
Regulamentaqtio EconGmica (ARE) t o regulate electricity, water, telecommunications, and urban and 
maritime passenger transport. ARE replaced a previous multi-sector regulatory agency (ARM) that had 
never become fully operational. At the time o f CAS preparation, ARE was just becoming functional, with 
s t a f f being hired. ARE was staffed and had begun developing tariff and other regulations by late 2005. 
Since being established, responsibility fo r regulating the telecoms sector has been transferred to the 
National Agency for Communications (ANAC), an autonomous regulator. In the transport sector, ARE 
has developed a l l regulations required to tender collective urban transportation routes in Praia and 
Mindelo. ARE i s responsible for setting and implementing tariffs for petroleum products, electricity and 
water but has not always effectively carried out this mandate. 
I n April 2006, the Bank approved a 
$400,000 capacity-building grant to build capacity at ARE, but the grant had not been implemented as o f 
December 2007 and was extended in early 2008 as part o f a stepped-up effort by the Bank to help 
Government resolve outstanding issues in the sector. 

48 

44. 

CAS outcome: Comprehensive labor code in place. This outcome was t o be measured b y the 
creation o f 2,000 fo rma l sector jobs. This ind ica tor was no t tracked; however, a comprehensive labor 
code i s in place and this outcome has been achieved with a satisfactory performance. Labor po l ic ies had 
hampered the Government’s divestiture f rom fo rme r ly state-owned en te rp r ises and parastatals, with high 
severance pay regulations and limited por tab i l i ty o f pension benefits. The Government prepared a new 
comprehensive labor code to facilitate labor mob i l i ty and ensure a clearer link between compensation and 
p roduc t iv i ty . The Government undertook extensive consultations on the labor law, which Parliament 
gave Government the legislative authority to enact. As a resu l t , it was published in October 2007 and 
subsequently passed in to law in April 2008. 

45. 

CAS outcome: 
Increase 
in public-private partnership 
investments 
to enhance 
competitiveness and reduce costs. This outcome was t o be measured by: (a) improvements in 
infrastructure competitiveness indices; (b) a 10 percent improvement in energy and water connections to 
customers; and (c) a reduc t ion in cost o f international telecom t o US$0.75/minute. The resu l ts in energy, 
water and telecom were achieved; however, infrastructure competitiveness indices were no t available to 
measure performance. 

46. 

The overa l l performance o f PPPs during the CAS per iod accounts fo r the moderately satisfactory 
performance, as there were some disappointments. A t the time o f CAS preparation, the Government had 
completed the divestiture o f a number o f key en terpr ises , 
inc lud ing in the energy, water and 
telecommunications sectors. The Bank sought t o he lp ensure adequate func t ion ing and services de l ivery 
o f these PPPs. 

47. 

Electra was pr iva t ized in December 1999, with the sale o f 51 percent o f the share value o f 
produc t ion assets o f e lec tr ic i ty and water to a Portuguese jo in t-ven ture (the Strategic Partners). However, 
in Ju ly 2006, the Government regained the pos i t ion o f ma jo r i ty shareholder fo l low ing protracted and 
unsuccessful negotiations on a se r ies o f issues concerning tariffs, Government arrears to Electra, and 
delayed investments on the part o f the Strategic Partners. The CAS ’ ma in concern regarding E lec tra was 
to improve efficiencies and services under the PPP, encouraging investments and new operators in 
d is tr ibu t ion to promote competition. In add i t ion to the PRSCs, the Bank-supported the sector through a 
US$17 m i l l i o n Energy and Water Sector Re form and Development project approved in 1999, and tw ice 
extended to close on June 2007. The Bank and other partners made efforts t o support the dialogue 
be tween the Government and the Strategic Partners o f Electra, bu t the PPP was dissolved due to an 
impasse resulting f rom a series o f technical and f inanc ia l operational issues that resulted in significant 
losses fo r Electra: high e lec tr ic i ty and water losses; h i g h operating cost due to h igh overheads; high 
commerc ia l losses due to t a r i f f setting be low costs, weak billing collection, and i l lega l consumption; and 
weaknesses in the contractual arrangements (e.g., no basis fo r t a r i f f setting and adjustments, and for 
p ro f i tab i l i ty measurement), as well as lack o f enforcement o f the contractual provisions. The central 
Government cleared arrears to Electra in 2006, but mun ic ipa l i t ies and autonomous institutions s t i l l have 
arrears owed to the company. E lec tra continues to grapple with s ign i f ican t cash-flow problems and 
s ign i f ican t operating losses. In September 2007, it required US$6.3 m i l l i o n f rom Government to cover 
the t a r i f f de f ic i t regarding the per iod M a y 2006-February 2007. 

48. 

As fo r the outcomes o f the Energy and Water Sector Project, some targets were met under the 
f i r s t o f the t w o Project Development Objectives: “Improved access to electricity, water and sanitation 
services, with op t imum use o f renewable resources, and p romo t ion o f pr iva te sector participation,” 
inc lud ing : increasing access to e lec tr ic i ty f rom 69 percent to 90 percent in Praia, and f rom 92 percent to 
98 percent in M inde lo ; access to water improved f rom 25 percent to 45 percent in Praia, and f rom 50 
percent to 60 percent in M inde lo ; and sanitation f rom 8 percent t o 20 percent in Praia and 20 percent to 30 
percent in M inde lo . However, the project d id no t successfully promote the use o f renewable resources o r 

49 

private sector participation, and i t did not achieve its secondary development objective o f increased 
operational and end-use efficiency in the power and water sectors, nor did i t reach the GEF objective o f 
removing the barriers to grid connected wind generation and off-grid PV electric systems despite this 
component having been delinked from IDA and extended to December 2008. This component supported 
a Wind Farm Project, which in 2006 had experienced procurement problems in a first tender and a non- 
responsive bidding process in a second tender. Under the extension, the project sought to support a non- 
profit PPP fund, INFRACO, to attract investors. However, because INFRACO used EU procurement 
processes to launch the bidding process, the Bank was ultimately unable to participate. The GEF grant 
closed as Unsatisfactory in December 2008. According to the f ina l ISR, as o f May 2008, penetration o f 
wind power was at 3 percent o f total electricity supply in 2002 and no households have connection to o f f - 
grid solar PV systems. This compares to a target o f 19 percent wind power penetration and 4,500 
households connected. 

49. 

Telecommunications: This sector has been one o f the most success fu l in Cape Verde in terms o f 
increasing access, reducing costs, improving services and strengthening the strategic, regulatory and legal 
environment to allow competition post-privatization, I n 2003, there was only one telecommunications 
company with a de-facto (even i f not de-jure) monopoly on telecommunications services until 2021; the 
sector legal framework dated from the mid-1990s; and there was no sector regulator. Cab0 Verde 
Telecom (CVT) was privatized in 1996 with Po r tuga l Telecom Znternacional (PTI) winning a competitive 
bidding process and signing a 25-year concession agreement. Starting in 2003, the Government launched 
wide-ranging policy and legal reforms aimed at fostering competition and strengthening the policy, legal 
and regulatory framework for information, communications and technology, and negotiating an 
agreement ending the exclusivity o f CVT on the international gateway. By 2006, more than 15 distinct 
reforms had been undertaken, including: the adoption in 2005 o f a new sector strategy to fully liberalize 
the telecom sector by January 2007; adoption o f a new sector law, the Electronic Communications law, in 
November 2005; adoption o f a number o f c r i t ica l regulations; establishment o f ANAC, a new regulatory 
agency; awarding a second GSM license to a US-based company; and launching negotiations with CVT 
to agree on compensation for terminating its exclusive rights over international ca l ls in January 2007. 

50. 

A number o f reforms supported by the Growth and Competitiveness project were also pertinent to 
Government efforts to access the World Trade Organization (WTO), including in the area o f supporting 
negotiations, customs reforms and intellectual property rights. Although Cape Verde first applied to join 
WTO in 1999, negotiations started in 2004 and significant progress was made during the period covered 
by the CAS. The European Union and Cape Verde in 2007 concluded bilateral market access negotiations 
on Cape Verde’s accession to the WTO. I n December 2007, the WTO General Council cleared the path 
for Cape Verde’s membership in the WTO by approving a package o f agreements which spelled out the 
terms o f Cape Verde’s accession. In July 2008, Cape Verde became the 153‘d member o f the WTO. 
Within the framework o f economic liberalization, a new customs Code was prepared, in line with the 
requirements on valuation o f imports and trade facilitation o f the revised Kyoto convention. 

5 1. 

CAS outcome: Implementation of a comprehensive transport sector reform strategy and 
increased public-private partnerships in the sector. This outcome was to be measured by the 
introduction o f an institutional and funding mechanism for the road maintenance fund and the 
introduction o f private participation in ports and a ir l ine services. This outcome was achieved in the road 
sector and airline services, but not achieved in ports. Performance i s moderately satisfactory. The 
Government sought to attract increased private investments in the transport sector, and the management 
contract for TACV was an important step toward private participation in the a i r l ine . The Government 
prepared a transport sector strategy in July 2007 which was finalized and submitted to the Bank in 
January 2008. A second generation Road Maintenance Fund (RMF) was established in June 2005 and 
became legally functional in January 2006. The RMF has been managing annual road maintenance 
budgets beginning in 2006, based on plans submitted by the Road Agency established in 2003.

Education 

54 . 

Cape V e r d e has la rge ly ach ieved the MDG o f assur ing un ive rsa l access t o education, with a ne t 
en ro l lmen t rate in p r im a r y schoo l o f 89 percen t and secondary en ro l lmen t o f 60 percen t in 2007 . P r im a r y 
c om p l e t i o n rates are abou t 95 percent, l i te racy rates f o r adu l ts we re at 81 percent, and 97 percen t f o r

The CAS proposed a Review o f Human Development to underpin support to the sector but this activity was 
dropped. 

5 1 

55 . 

Under the CAS, the PRSC ser ies (1-111) was the main Bank instrument to provide support to the 
education sector. Policy priorities supported by the PRSC ser ies included: (a) improve the quality and 
efficiency o f education; (b) expand and diversify general and technical secondary education supply; 
expand and better orient professional training service delivery; and (c) res t ruc tu re higher education. 

56. 

The key CAS outcomes for education, as stated in the results framework are below. Progress 
toward these outcomes with Bank support i s satisfactory: 

57 . 

CAS outcome: Early childhood education services expanded, to be measured by the 
percentage o f 3 - 5 year olds enrolled in pre-primary. Services were expanded to increase enrollment o f 3 - 
5 year olds from 57 percent in 2003 to 64 percent in 2007. The Government implemented a teacher 
training plan that increased the number o f adequately trained teachers from 75 percent in 2003 to 83 in 
2006, making i t possible for more early childhood development centers to operate. 

58 . 

CAS outcome: Improved quality and efficiency o f education, to be measured by repetition and 
completion rates and percentage o f primary teachers with academic training (no baseline provided): In the 
f i r s t year o f the teacher training plan, 605 primary teachers were trained. The increase in qualified 
teachers i s part o f the strategy for improving the quality and efficiency o f education by reducing the 
repetition rate. The Government launched a construction plan for 9 secondary schools and this helped to 
percent. Nonetheless, primary repetition remains high at a l l levels, at 14 percent for primary i n 2007 - 
expand access to secondary school to meet growing enrollment. Primary completion rates are about 95 
similar to rates in 2004. 

59 . 

CAS outcome: Expanded and diversified general and technical education and professional 
training services, to be measured by the number o f students completing 8 years o f schooling and the 
percentage o f poor students benefiting from school welfare programs (no baseline or benchmarks 
provided; see Table A2-1 for results measured). A vocational training assessment was completed in 2005 
along with a Strategic Action Plan. Technical and professional training became a key priority fo r the 
Government as it sought to upgrade human resources skills and capital to meet the needs o f the booming 
services industries. A legal and regulatory framework for vocational training i s being developed. The 
Bank’s support did not contribute in any meaningful way to this objective under the 2005 CAS. 

60. 

CAS outcome: Consolidated and restructured tertiary education sector, to be measured by 
enrollment in professional training and apprenticeship programs (this indicator was not tracked): With 
the establishment o f the University o f Cape Verde in 2005 and the Jean Piaget University o f Cape Verde 
in 2001, the country has a public and private university, respectively, which provide tertiary education. 
However, i t i s unclear that anything further has been done to res t ruc tu re and consolidate the sector. 
Although education was dropped as a sector focus under the 3‘d PRSC (2007), the Bank agreed in 2007 to 
supervise activities financed by the Dutch in support o f the implementation o f Cape Verde’s Strategic 
P lan on Technical and Vocational Education and Training. This support, along with a proposed ESW/TA 
to boost youth skills and employment, w i l l be key instruments o f support to the sector under the new 
CAS. 

Health

Cape Verde i s on track to achieve the health MDGs. The infant mortality ra te was 25 per 1,000 
births in 2007, and child mortality was 34 per 1,000 births. The maternal mortality rate was 5 per 1,000 
births. However, these good indicators mask significant disparities in services and an unsustainable 
health financing framework. Among the main sector issues are:

CAS outcome: Improved financial access and sustainability o f health services, to be 
measured by percentage o f population covered by health insurance and financial ratios o f health 
insurance. This outcome was achieved and performance i s satisfactory. PRSC indicators were not aligned 
with the CAS indicators, and rather included controlling the increase o f non-communicable diseases and 
introducing health prevention and promotion programs, as well as reforming the soc ia l security system to 
reduce expenditures on health. I n 2006, the Government began publishing yearly statistical reports on 
key health indicators, completing a c ruc ia l step toward a concerted effort to prevent and treat non- 
communicable diseases. An analysis of non-communicable diseases by the national statistics agency 
(INE) and the World Health Organization was completed in 2007 to provide essential data on trends in 
non-communicable diseases and how to respond to them. Meanwhile, reforms were undertaken to expand 
the social security system (INPS), including introducing user fees. Some 14,000 c iv i l servants had health 
insurance covered by INPS by the end o f the CAS period. The INPS posted a positive balance o f CVE36 
million in 2006 and CVE27 million in 2007, enabling i t to c lear its debt to the central budget. 

Social Protection 

67. 

About 173,000 Cape Verdeans live below the poverty l i n e on incomes o f about US$450 a year 
(2001-2002). O f these, 93,000 live in extreme poverty, on incomes o f less than US$300 a year. Over half 
o f those considered extremely poor live on the main island o f Santiago, and two thirds live i n ru ra l areas. 
Creating a more sustainable social protection system was also a priority for Government given a relatively 
high unemployment rate, particularly in ru ra l areas where agricultural opportunities a re limited. At the 
time o f CAS preparation, labor-intensive public works schemes generated very low-paying temporary 
jobs in rura l areas and had not built the skills needed for the services sectors. 

68. 

To appreciate the context for the objectives and achievements in the area o f soc ia l protection 
during the CAS period, i t i s useful to have a sense o f the framework that exists, which includes the 
elements in the following paragraphs. 

69 . 

Temporary employment creation scheme: Created in the 1970s, the Frente a Alta Intensidade de 
Mano-de-Obra (FAIMO) was a labor intensive public works scheme which provided temporary 
employment, mainly in the form o f c iv i l works projects on roads and for soil conservation, for very low 
wages (ha l f the extreme poverty threshold). Over time, this program has become equated with low labor 
productivity, limited impact o f investments and l i t t l e skills accumulation fo r participants. A key objective 
o f the IDA Social Sector Development Project was to help Government restructure FAIMO and create a 
more efficient and productive institution, AGECABO, to execute public works. 
I t has s ince been 
superseded by a community-led small works program known as Micro-realizapjes. 

70. 

Two soc ia l security systems are financed with contributions from formal sector workers that 
together cover about one quarter o f the labor force and pay pensions to about 6,000 retirees: the Public 
Administration (AP) plan, with contributions from some 13,000 civil servants; and the National Institute 
for Social Security (INPS) with contributions from about 31,000 private sector employees. I n 2001, a 
framework law established the principle for integrating the two pension schemes. A f i n a l proposal for 
integrating the pension programs was translated into a law approved and implemented in 2006. The 2006 
PER included a detailed analysis o f the f i s c a l impact caused by the shifting o f public workers into the 
contributory scheme managed by INPS. To date more than 11,000 workers have been transferred and/or 
integrated into the INPS . The Government implemented important measures to ensure that financial 
contributions to the INPS are made on time. However, there are s t i l l a number o f issues to be resolved to 
better harmonize the pension programs and improve their f i s c a l situations, and Government i s considering 
what reforms need to be undertaken in this respect. The Growth and Competitiveness project financed a

71. 

There are t w o non -con t r ibu to ry p lans tha t p r o v i d e income suppor t t o the poo r : the Minimum 
Soc ia l Pens ion (PSM), w h i c h covers 6,500 elderly, hand icapped and o thers in need o f c r i t i c a l support; 
and the Soc ia l S o l i d a r i t y Pens ion (PSS) ava i lab le t o some 10,000 e l d e r l y wo rke rs w h o par t ic ipa ted in the 
FAIMO f o r mo re than 10 years. These programs cost Gove rnmen t just under US $ 5 m i l l i o n a year and 
recen t studies show t h e y need t o better targe t the poorest. 

72. 

Las t ly , there are soc ia l assistance programs tha t cove r a v a r i e t y o f services f o r vu lnerab le groups, 
i n c l u d i n g n u t r i t i o n f o r p o o r c h i l d r e n and the elderly, t r a i n i n g f o r the d isab led and subs id ized wa ter and

governmen t s t a f f t o im p r o v e q u a l i t y o f services. T h e Gove rnmen t tes ted targe ted subsidies t o encourage 

5 5 

c 

access to education and health by the poor, including for secondary school fees and access to medicine. 
On this basis, the MTS increased support fo r secondary and vocational education for at-risk groups, 
reaching 184 students in 2005. With regard to increasing access o f at-risk groups to health services, the 
Government decided that rather than providing subsidies i t would pursue community-based health 
insurance as a more effective way o f achieving this objective, following the results and recommendations 
o f a study prepared by the International Labor Organization. 

77. 

CAS outcome: Expanded coverage and better targeting o f the non-contributory pension 
schemes, as measured by the percentage o f soc ia l pension recipients in the lowest income quintile (no 
level proposed for indicator). This outcome i s considered as having been achieved, however, and 
performance i s satisfactory. The PSS and PSM have been integrated into one system with a unified MIS 
database; new digital I D cards have been issued to beneficiaries and a revised poverty map was used to 
allocate additional pensions by municipalities. As a result, the number of beneficiaries increased from 
14,446 in 2005 to 18,462 in 2007 and 21,000 in 2008. 

78. 

Improved outreach and coverage o f children at extreme risk, as measured by number o f 
children receiving services and staff trained to receive children. Although these indicators were not 
explicitly tracked, performance i s considered satisfactory on the basis o f other indicators. The Counc i l o f 
Ministers in February 2005 passed a resolution to establish a National Commission for Legal and 
Institutional Reform for Children and Adolescents, setting the stage for a major overhaul o f the legislative 
and institutional framework to protect children. The I C M increased supervision o f NGOs and local 
associations providing services to at-risk children and youth, including updating data on service providers 
and helping resolve implementation issues . The ICM ’s Child Emergency Centers were expanded in 2005 
and the institute was renamed the Cape Verdean Institute for Children and Adolescents. Entities for the 
defense o f children’s rights were established in a l l municipalities, and the use o f the Cape Verdean 
Institute fo r Minors Child Emergency centers was expanded. I n the health sector, there were significant 
improvements in the availability o f important specialties such as orthopedic surgery and general surgery, 
among others, and funding for priority health programs (e.g., tuberculosis, malaria), which fully matched 
the augmented funding levels in the GPRSP. 

79. 

Better prevention and management o f food crises, as measured by the time between c r i s i s and 
response. This indicator was not tracked and it i s unclear what performance has been. There was minimal 
progress in this area during the PRSC 1 and i t was not tracked under PRSC 2 and PRSC 3 . However, 
actions accomplished under PRSC 1 mainly set the stage for more effective actions to prevent food cr ises . 
A food security survey was carried out and a National Council for Food Security created in August 2005. 
These steps were to make i t possible to estimate the number o f families and the zones at nutritional risk 
and lay the ground for a more coordinated approach, respectively.

The links between the long-term goals o f the GPRSP and the CAS outcomes were clearly spelled 
out in the CAS Results Framework. However, as i s often the case, evaluating Bank contribution to 
specific long-term country outcomes i s not always possible, and it i s often difficult to isolate the impact 
o f World Bank support from that o f other donors also supporting GPRSP implementation. Government 
leadership and ownership played a determining ro le in the success o f reforms and activities for GPRSP 
goals; however, Bank readiness to support these e f fo r ts are what also made the difference. 

81. 

The CAS states that monitoring and evaluation o f Bank results would be aligned with that o f the 
GPRSP, with the overall objective o f ensuring easy and timely access to relevant data to monitor 
progress, evaluate the impact o f the GPRSP and helping define new orientations or make changes based 

56 

on analysis o f current data. To this end, the Government planned to implement an ambitious M&E 
system that integrated budget and f inanc ia l management systems with technical aspects o f program 
delivery, while also developing an integrated technological platform for the system, and providing open 
access for users to the main data warehouses. The Bank mobilized a GPRSP Trust Fund to also support 
this effort. 

82. 

There were significant delays putting in place the M&E system, although some progress was 
registered, including: establishing the Technical Secretariat for Development Assistance (STAD) in 
charge o f coordinating M&E activities in early 2007; creating sectoral databases for agriculture and 
education; preparing a disaggregated poverty map; undertaking a pilot household survey o f core welfare 
indicators (QUIBB) to track poverty, the f ina l results o f which were made available in the f a l l o f 2008; 
and completion o f the first tw o phases for establishing the national data bank for o f f i c i a l statistics. The 
Government also prepared an annual progress report in July 2006 and i s finalizing a draft implementation 
evaluation o f the GPRSP. Other tools used to monitor GPRSP progress include periodic reporting on the 
MDGs; budget monitoring through PERs; sector budget execution and results o f service delivery targets; 
and periodic surveys to track poverty and access to services carried out by the National Statistics Institute 
(NE) . 

83. 

To encourage Government to make further progress with the M&E framework, several actions 
were completed as prior actions for PRSC 3, including: analyzing the data o f the QUIBB survey; 
completing STAD staffing; and starting implementation o f the training program detailed in the Statistical 
Agenda. 

IV . 

Sustainability 

84. 

There are strong prospects fo r sustainability o f IDA support to Cape Verde, given the context o f a 
central Government that i s committed and leading visible and meaningful reforms. Capacity i s small and 
needs to be increased, and the decentralization agenda i s a priority to strengthen municipalities and loca l 
institutions. 

85 . 

During the CAS period under review, two projects closed: The Soc ia l Sector Development 
Pro jec t and the Energy and Water Sector Project. The SSDP (rated Satisfactory at closing) helped 
strengthen institutional capacity a t the central level, notably with the National Poverty Alleviation 
Program (PNLP), today an autonomous agency under the Ministry o f Labor, Family and Solidarity, which 
continues to implement programs financed by IFAD and AfDB. Through AGECABO, the employment 
and contracting agency created under the PNLP, and the Delegated Contract Management Agencies 
(private loca l businesses and NGOs), the SSDP successfully replaced the preexisting FAIMO system that 
had become unproductive with a new model fo r creating jobs and alleviating poverty through a more 
competitive, private-sector oriented approach, with better pay fo r workers, while improving access to 
basic services through community public works. Seventeen municipalities received training in project 
planning and management, and these skills would have contributed to the project’s sustainability. 
However, as reflected in the project ICR and comments made by the Borrower, the project did not 
provide as much capacity-building and support to municipalities and to the smaller firms and NGOs that 
implemented sub-projects as it had se t out to do. The project boosted economic activity by supporting 
these organizations just as Cape Verde was moving to a market-based economy, but while some 
associations managed to find new financing, including from other donors such as the International Fund 
for Agricultural Development, others were not viable without the project. AGECABO closed i t s doors in 
2006, although i t had been expected to function without the project, according to the ICR. 

57 

86 . With regard to the Energy and Water project,’ the investments made to extend infrastructure 
services w i l l need to be maintained in both urban and rura l areas. Given the technical and financial 
difficulties o f these sectors, i t i s unclear that the achievements under the project w i l l be sustained. 
However, the Bank and other donors can improve the prospect fo r services to be sustainable through 
future support to salvage Electra and restore i t s capacity. 

V. Institutional Impact 

87 . 

CAS operations included a number o f capacity and institution building activities, and these have 
largely been discussed in the above section on CAS outcomes. 

V I . Exogenous Factors and Unintended Negative Impact 

8 8 . 

Exogenous factors that affected CAS outcomes include the high o i l prices which hit the energy 
sector, the cost o f living, and the depreciating dollar, which increased the cost o f project activities. 
Contrary to a concern expressed in the CAS, the depreciating dollar did not dampen investments, which 
increased continually, particularly in tourism and r e a l estate development. CAS implementation did not 
have any unintended negative impacts that the country team i s aware o f . 

C . BANK PERFORMANCE 

I. Lending 

89 . 

Bank lending for FY05-09 was US $ 7 3 million, compared to a proposed base case o f US$50 
million and a high case o f US$71 million for the CAS period. The actual lending amount through FY08, 
US $ 6 3 million, was determined by the IDA 14 envelope, which was largely front-loaded, but which 
benefited from internal reallocation and modest scale-up o f resources (U S $ 5 million) in FY08 due to 
Cape Verde’s strong IDA performance and strong CPIA scorecard. The CAS triggers fo r the base case 
included: (a) continued satisfactory macroeconomic performance (PRSC trigger); (b) no more than one 
project with IDA commitment considered at risk; and (c) adequate budget allocation to GPRSP sectors; 
and (d) avoidance o f accumulation o f new domestic arrears, especially to suppliers and utilities beyond 
0.2 percent o f GDP. The high case triggers included: (a) no part o f the portfolio considered at risk; (b) 
substantial implementation o f priority actions of the CFAA, including presentation to Parliament o f the 
executed budget o f the previous year no la ter than six months after the end o f the year, and submission to 
Parliament o f the State’s general accounts for the period 2000-2003; (c) completion o f process to attract 
private partners in the transport sector, specifically the a i r l ine and the port, and (d) improvement in the 
investment climate, as measured by the reduction by half o f the average time to establish an enterprise, 

using 2002 as a point o f reference. 

90 . 

The high case triggers were partially met: (trigger a) A l l but one o f the projects met their 
development objectives; the energy sector operation was at risk o f not meeting i t s DO for a period o f time 
early in the CAS period, then turned around briefly, and ultimately closed Unsatisfactory. The 
implementation o f CFAA actions were supported by the PRSC series, and the submission to Parliament 
o f the State’s general accounts for 1998-2005 were met (trigger b); as o f 2007, the previous year’s 
accounts were finalized within months following the f isca l year’s closing. I n addition, quarterly accounts 
are prepared on a timely basis, and have been submitted to Parliament on a regular basis since 2004. 
Cape Verde made partial progress in the process to attract private partners in the airline and the port 
(trigger c); however, this objective was not fully achieved in the CAS period. The investment climate, as 

The ICR for this project w i l l be produced i n June 2009 , six months after the December 2008 closing o f the GEF grant 
component. 

5 8 

measured by the reduction by half o f the average time to establish an enterprise (trigger d), was 
accomplished with the launching in Sgo Vicente and subsequently Praia o f the "citizen's house'' services 
allowing businesses to be establishedregistered in one day. 

91. 

Despite meeting the high case triggers, disbursements during the CAS period reached only US63 
million, due to the limitations in the IDA resources allocated to Cape Verde. However, US$10 million in 
budget support disbursed in July 2008 in the new f i s c a l year (IDA 15 resources). Overall, U S 4 5 million 
o f IDA support was disbursed through PRSCs I-IVY or 71 percent o f the total. Investment projects were 
delivered as anticipated, with the exception o f a proposed multi-sector private infrastructure project. 
Instead the Bank provided supplemental financing for the Growth and Competitiveness Project and the 
Road Sector Support Program. The proposed and ac tua l lending programs for the CAS are presented in 
Table A2-2. 

11. Analytical and Advisory Activities 

92. 

The Bank largely delivered the AAA program as proposed in the CAS, with the exception o f two 
studies. A Rural Development Assessment was initiated but due to quality i s s u e s was re-launched in 
FY08 and was reoriented to focus on livelihoods and youth but was dropped in light o f the priorities 
under the new CAS. However, a Fisheries sector review prepared as part o f the work on ru ra l 
development was well received and was converted into a stand-alone sector work. A Human 
Development Review was planned but not pursued. The AAA was generally well received by 
Government and also received a satisfactory assessment by the Bank's Quality Assurances Group (QAG), 
which carried out a review o f AAA in FY07. Annual Public Expenditure Reviews provide an important 
basis for dialogue with Government and coordination with IMF on policy and reform issues as well as for 
defining the PRSC program. An integrated C FM C P A R was prepared in FY06 to assess progress i n 
implementing fiduciary reforms and provided the underpinning for public financial management reforms. 
An Infrastructure Regulation and Competitiveness Diagnostic Report and an Investment Climate 
Assessment (ICA) were prepared in 2006 and contributed to the dialogue on growth and improving the 
business environment. A Pension Study was prepared under the Growth and Competitiveness Project to 
underpin policy recommendations for pension reform. The Poverty Assessment i s being updated and 
expected to be finalized in FY09; however a Long-term Growth and Competitiveness Study was not 
initiated in FY07, and w i l l instead be replaced under the new CAS with an initial labor market 
assessment. 

93. 

One weakness with AAA dissemination stemmed from Government delays or non-responsiveness 
to requests from the Bank for their reaction to studies or fo r agreement to publish the reports, despite their 
expressed satisfaction with the reports mentioned to Bank staff. The Bank successfully disseminated the 
results o f some important AAA through workshops with central and local government as well as civil 
society, private sector and development partners. The Government initiated a working group following 
the ICA workshop to develop a strategy for implementing the recommendations. That said, the QAG 
evaluation rated participation, consultation and dissemination o f AAA as moderately satisfactory, and this 
i s an area that the Bank should strengthen going forward. 

111. Portfolio Assessment 

94. 

Cape Verde has had the top performing portfolio in the Africa Region, barring the performance o f 
the energy and water operation. That said, the portfolio i s quite small, with three investment operations 
representing U S 4 8 . 5 million equivalent, o f which US$4 million was undisbursed, as o f February 20, 
2009. A l l operations are rated satisfactory. There are no problem projects or commitments at risk. Over 
the CAS period, the portfolio has included five investment operations: (1) the Growth and 

59 

Competitiveness Project; (2) the Multi-Sector HIV/AIDS Support Project; (3) the Road Sector Support 
Program (RSSP); (4) the Energy and Water Project (IDA and GEF financed); and (5 ) the Soc ia l Sector 
Development Project. The RSSP i s the youngest project, having become effective in August 2005 and 
closing in 2010. The projects are implemented by Project Coordination Units within ministries, with the 
exception o f the RSSP implemented by the Ministry o f Infrastructure, Transport and Sea and the PRSCs, 
which are coordinated directly by the Ministry o f Finance. To create synergies among the different 
PCU’s fiduciary teams, they were co-located in one building. However, each PCU eventually maintained 
distinct fiduciary s ta f f . 

95 . Grant financing was mobilized from several sources and played an important role in ensuring 
implementation o f many CAS activities. I n addition to the GEF grant for Energy and Water, there were 
IDF and JSDF grants to strengthen the j u s t i c e sector; an IDF grant to strengthen the court o f auditors; a 
second poverty reduction strategy t r u s t fund grant for public expenditure analysis, M&E, and other 
activities; and a PPIAF grant to strengthen capacity at ARE. The implementation o f these grants 
contributed to the outcomes discussed ea r l ie r . 

96 . 

Changes in Task Team Leaders fo r two important IDA infrastructure projects and the PRSC I V 
weakened Bank performance by creating significant interruptions and delays in the dialogue with Cape 
Verdean counterparts and subsequently in project execution. Due to the enormous demands on 
Procurement and Financial Management services for the Country Department’s portfolio, and given the 
nature o f the work, fiduciary assistance for project implementation was often late, though implementing 
agencies managed to navigate procurement and FM procedures with TTL support. 
I n addition, the 
Country Team often had difficulties obtaining punctual Bank techn ica l expertise for very specific issues 
which would have contributed to stronger dialogue with the Authorities. 

97 . 

A CAS Progress Report should have been prepared in FY07. However, with Cape Verde poised 
to access IBRD financing in 2008, the Bank decided to move forward with a new CAS instead. The new 
CAS i s being finalized in 2009, once the Bank’s dialogue with the Authorities on the new growth agenda 
had clarified the priorities fo r the IDA and IBRD programs. A CAS Progress Report would have 
provided an opportunity to revisit the CAS indicators and adjust the strategy as needed. 

IV. Country Dialogue and Donor Harmonization 

9 8 . 

The country dialogue i s boosted by the strong performance o f the Bank portfolio and the 
ana ly t ica l work to support reforms. Cape Verde’s eligibility fo r access to IBRD resources as o f the new 
CAS should also strengthen the dialogue. I t i s important to note that the country w i l l continue receiving 
concessional support from IDA fo r the foreseeable future and Cape Verde w i l l be a blend (IDA and 
IBRD) borrower under the new CAS for FY09-12. 
In-country representation would significantly 
strengthen country dialogue and should be considered seriously. 

99 . 

Coordination with donors has been significantly enhanced through the work o f the joint Budget 
Support Group, which has strengthened harmonization through support for a shared policy reform matrix 
agreed to with Government. The growth o f the Budget Support Group has helped to increase 
coordination and harmonization. The GPRSP has also provided the basis for coordinating donor 
investment and budget support. While IDA has been the largest donor financier to Cape Verde recently, 
the UN i s responsible for loca l donor coordination and organizing Round Tables. The Bank i s also a 
member o f the Support Group for the Transition, organized by the Ministry o f External Cooperation with 
UN support to ra ise awareness o f the implications o f Cape Verde’s graduation to a M I C and to increase 
support for its continued access to concessional aid and other programs generally reserved fo r LDCs, 

60 

V. Client Feedback 

100. As part o f the preparation o f the CAS Completion Report, discussions were held with Cape Verde 
o f f ic ia ls on their views on Bank and project performance. This section presents some o f the feedback 
provided during these discussions. 

101. There was very positive feedback from the Ministry o f Finance and the Ministry o f Economy 
regarding the Bank’s decision to channel an increasing amount o f financing through the budget. The 
benefits cited included greater flexibility and predictability for Government to channel funds as needed, 
for example to meet the rising financing needs in health and pensions, or to finance TA without going 
through cumbersome procurement procedures. The PRSC Series, as part o f the coordinated and broader 
support o f donors, was also instrumental in supporting a l l aspects o f public finance and helping to ensure 
the sustainability o f the financial systems and reforms established. As expressed by some o f f ic ia ls , the 
challenge going forward i s to transfer the f isca l discipline introduced at the central level to the 
municipalities. The work on PRSCs was also an important catalyst for bringing together the Budget 
Support Group and was considered by Government to be more e f f i c i e n t than the project approach. 

102. The Bank’s management o f the Cape Verde portfolio from Washington and Dakar was seen as 
l e s s efficient than i t would otherwise be if there were a loca l representation, and there was a general 
desire for an empowered local o f f ice to be established which could help make decisions more rapidly and 
facilitate communication. 

103. There was a request fo r the Bank to do more on capacity building by supporting professional 
education and SMEs to better prepare the labor market for the opportunities growing in the services 
industry, and to be more responsive to Government requests for punctual TA. Bank analytical support 
was regarded as very useful and a re fe rence source for Government on many issues, but there was also a 
concern expressed that i t was somewhat supply driven. 

104. For their part, project coordinators generally expressed an appreciation for having the 
independence to move more quickly than they believed would be possible within a l i n e ministry. 
However, there was also a shared perception that the Bank needed to be more responsive in reacting to 
non-objection requests. 

105. Despite the weak performance rating for the Energy and Water Project, both Government 
officials and the project s ta f f said that this had been a very important project fo r Cape Verde and had been 
successful in many ways. However, there was a general frustration with how the project was at times 
managed by the Bank, particularly in reference to how some procurement issues were handled which 
delayed progress with important components. I t was suggested several times that the Bank would need to 
remain engaged in the sector given the power sector’s pivotal role in the economy and implications for 
the national budget. 

106. Some o f f ic ia ls f e l t that the Bank should do more to reach the poorest, that budget support was 
invisible to the population, and that the Bank should ensure that the focus on growth and infrastructure, 
which the private sector should handle, no t come at the expense o f supporting loca l communities. To 
address the needs o f poor or working c lass communities, the Bank should focus i t s support on training for 
small businesses (small fishermen, artisans, farmers) that can provide services or goods to the tourism 
sector, and increase access to credit. Infrastructure and professional education were cited as t h e two key 
strategic themes for the Government’s transformation strategy to succeed and as areas where the Bank 
should be present going forward. 

61 

C. Conclusions and Lessons Going Forward 

107. Overall, progress toward achieving CAS outcomes was satisfactory and the Bank’s 
performance was also satisfactory. Overarching (medium-term) objectives of supporting growth and 
reducing poverty were achieved, and the Bank executed most o f the activities it planned and contributed 
to the envisioned outcomes, in line with the GPRSP objectives. The shift to providing a greater share of 
IDA resources as budget support was successful, as i t bolstered the reform program and strengthened 
country dialogue and donor coordination. The portfolio included a good mix o f IDA investment 
operations and grant-projects that supported activities to complement the policy reform program 
supported by the PRSCs and supported implementation o f the GPRSP. The portfolio performance was 
satisfactory for most o f the CAS period. However, the AAA program reflected the CAS priorities, though 
i t wasn’t executed in its entirety. Key lessons for the Bank going forward include the following: 

9 Explore options to strengthen the relationship with the client by increasing the Bank’s presence and 
visibility in the country. A key theme that has been recurrent in discussions with Cape Verde i s the 
desire to have a stronger Bank presence in the country and more supervision missions. This could be 
accomplished by establishing a loca l representation and more frequent missions by the Country 
Management Unit. 
> Increase outreach to civil society, including the parliamentarians, the private sector, political leaders, 
and opinion leaders (Le., the media) to strengthen dissemination of studies and analytical work; build a 
dialogue with non-government actors; and increase awareness o f the Bank’s support to Cape Verde. 
9 Strengthen focus on reducing inequality between islands and between urban versus rural areas. Pursue 
analytical work to strengthen targeting mechanisms, as well as investment or TA support to improve 
opportunities, especially for underemployed youth. 
9 Given the fundamental need for energy and water services to support the rapid growth in tourism and 
other services, as well as to meet the needs o f citizens and improve the quality o f l i f e for the poorest, 
the Bank should rethink its strategy for supporting the sector under the new CAS, including to help 
Government invest in alternative renewable sources o f energy. 
9 Public-private partnerships need national consensus and support to be successful. In the transport and 
energy sectors, efforts to establish successful PPPs have been undercut by a lack o f genuine support for 
these. 
9 The Bank should continue supporting Cape Verde’s reform program through budget support, 
including for further strengthening o f the investment climate and infrastructure services, and to support 
the use o f new IBRD resources to leverage private investments in growth-oriented infrastructure 
services that have an impact on poverty. Weak capacity, due to inadequate human resources, remains a 
key constraint for Government. The Bank should increase support for capacity-building to Government 
and ensure that resources are utilized. 
9 Some o f the risks anticipated in the CAS were realized and the Bank should r e f l e c t on new mitigation 
measures. For example, the increase in o i l prices (an external shock) exacerbated the financial 
difficulties stemming from the delays in setting tariff or energy products and the payment arrears 
accumulated by municipalities. This had repercussions on services as well as presenting a contingent 
liability for the budget. 
9 The Government faced some difficulties preparing the MTEF and delays setting up the M&E system, 
both o f which were needed for better planning and monitoring o f the GPRSP and indirectly CAS 
results. 
9 Donors, including the Bank, should continue to provide Cape Verde with access to concessional 
financing and maintain other special economic arrangements to help the country make a smooth

CAPE VERDE 

Joint World Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability Analysis 

Prepared by the s ta f fs of the International Development Association and

Approved by Sudhir Shetty and Carlos Braga (World Bank)

November 7 , 2 0 0 8 

The risk of debt distress in Cape Verde remains low. Nevertheless, medium-term fiscal policy w i l l 

reverse the public debt decline of recent years. The total public debt-to-GDP ra t io is projected to rise 
until 2012 and then decline thereafter-a path opposite that projected in the 2007 DSA. The 
temporary rise in external debt w i l l be only partially offset by continued decline in domestic debt. 
Despite the rise, debt ratios remain manageable in a l l scenarios. Foreign direct investment (FDiJ w i l l 
finance most of 
the external current account deficit, which w i l l narrow as Cape Verde transforms 
itself into a services exporter. The main risks to the debt outlook are currency exposure and 
contingent liabilities. The risk of debt distress remains low under the baseline as well as alternative 
scenarios that take those risks into consideration. 

1. BACKGROUND5’ 
1, 
This DSA reviews the evolution o f Cape Verde’s public debt since the 2007 DSA6’ and 
analyzes the projected debt path f o r the period 2008-28. Using the Fund-World Bank debt 
sustainability framework (DSF), i t projects the baseline economic scenario and performs stress tests 
to assess whether debt distress w i l l stay low. The thresholds for public external debt distress are 
those for countries like Cape Verde that have sound policies and institutions (Table 1).61 The 
baseline scenario was updated based on discussions with the authorities during the fifth review o f 
the Policy Support Instrument (PSI) (September-October 2 0 0 8 ) . The discussions centered on the 
2009 budget and the medium-term f isca l framework the authorities submitted to Parliament in 
October 2008 along with the 2009 budget. 

5 9 This analysis includes only central government debt and guarantees; i t excludes municipalities and state-owned 
enterprises. 
6o I M F Country Report 08/37 and Wor ld Bank Report 44350-CV. 
Cape Verde’s score on the Wor ld Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) was upgraded in 2007 from 
4.1 to 4.2. I ts average score for 2005-07 was 4.13, above the 3.75 floor for strong performers. 

2 . 

Since the last DSA Cape Verde has continued to reduce public debt as a percentage o f 
GDP and to change its composition (Table 2). T o t a l p u b l i c deb t (domestic plus external) was 
reduced by 10 percentage po in ts in 2007. N e t domes t ic debt was pushed d o w n t o the o r i g i n a l P S I

The baseline scenario projects that international reserves will continue to accumulate, 
as will government deposits at the BCV. The prudent f isca l po l icy implemented in the PS I i s 
assumed to continue through the forecast horizon, with fore ign reserves building up. This 
assumption i s based on two facts: 
a. 
In October 2008 the authorities submitted to Parliament a medium-term f isca l framework fo r 
2009-20 1 1 that indicates a prudent f isca l po l icy . A l though the po l icy reverses the recent 
decline in pub l ic debt, it preserves a stable debt path that allows fo r pub l ic investments in 
infrastructure and social t rans fe rs . 
b. The authorities announced in the L e t t e r o f Intent fo r the 5’ PS I rev iew that they in tend to 
continue with a PS I fo r at least four more years, until 2013 (a I -yea r extension o f the current 
PS I fo l lowed by a request fo r a new 3-year PSI). 

Based on these facts, net domestic bo r row ing i s projected to be contained in the nex t 20 years, 
a l low ing ne t domestic debt62 to land so f t ly at about 11 percent o f GDP. This f isca l restraint i s needed 
to accomplish the authorities’ goal o f increasing rese rve coverage by 0.1 mon th o f prospective 
impor ts each year, reaching 5.7 months by 2028 (equivalent to 41 percent o f GDP). F inanc ing the 
rese rve accumulation requires that the Treasury make annual deposits o f about 1.2 percent o f GDP at 
the B C V . Using the balance sheet approach, this r e s u l t assumes that the authorities’ efforts to develop 
the domestic securities market w i l l a l low the domestic pr iva te sector to absorb about 19 percent o f 
GDP in Treasury securities by 2028 (Table 4).

The baseline scenario assumes a faster r ise than the previous DSA in the share o f 
nonconcessional external borrowing. Wh i le Cape Verde w i l l continue to have access to 
concessional loans f rom I D A and others,63 this DSA assumes tha t Cape Verde w i l l increasingly take 
out nonconcessional loans to finance growth-enhancing pub l ic investments. I t i s assumed that the 
average grant e lemen t o f a l l external bo r row ing w i l l decline t o l e s s than 10 percent by 2028. This

77 

assumption i s justified by the recent graduation o f Cape Verde from the U.N.’s least-developed 
country category and nonconcessional loans envisaged with the European Investment Bank (EIB), 
the IBRD, and the OPEC Fund. This assumption i s u s e f u l for probing the res i l ience o f the debt path 
to less favorable borrowing terms.64 To further test res i l ience in stress scenarios, the grant element o f 
marginal debt65 i s negative because i t i s assumed that under s t ress conditions the country would be 
charged a risk premium o f 100 basis points above the market rate.66

3. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTA INAB IL ITY 
BASELINE SCENARIO 
9 . 
Although the recent decline in external debt will be temporarily reversed because 
borrowing to finance public investments will accelerate, i t will remain below the threshold. I n 
the previous DSA, external debt was expected to decline continuously. The reason for the difference 
i s the new funds Cape Verde recently secured fo r public investments, especially from the EIB and 
the IBRD. The finding that this temporary r i s e in external borrowing w i l l not jeopardize debt 
sustainability repeats the finding o f the 2007 DSA that a 5-year scaling-up o f nonconcessional 
borrowing i s consistent with debt sustainability. The average grant element o f the new borrowing 

64 The Fund and the Bank w i l l provide TA to Cape Verde on debt management to enable the authorities to ensure that hture 
nonconcessional borrowing i s consistent w i th debt sustainability, especially because the nonconcessional borrow ing w i l l 
double the external interest b i l l through 2028.

f r o m the dec l ine in concessional f i n a n c i n g and the assumed shor ten ing o f amo r t iza t ion per iods . 
Because in this DSA the gran t e lemen t o f n ew b o r r ow i n g i s p ro jec ted t o dec l ine faster than in the 
p rev ious one, the r i s e in debt service ra t ios w i l l be f ron t loaded ra ther than backloaded, as i t was in 
the p rev ious DSA. 

ALTERNATIVE AND STRESS SCENARIOS 

The risk o f external debt distress i s low even with depreciation and an abrupt

worsening o f borrowing terms. T h e debt ra t ios rema in fa r b e l ow t h e i r thresho lds in a l l a l terna t ive

base l ine rates (F igure 1 and A2 Tab le 6). This finding re in forces 
the conc lus ion tha t

peg. This resu l t i s a co ro l la ry t o the cau t iona ry no te abou t the coun t ry ’s cu r rency exposure (7 3).67 In 
the h i s t o r i c a l scenario, the ex terna l debt r a t i o r ises f o r a longer p e r i o d o f t im e because FDI i s less 
than in the baseline, but i t also dec l ines faster in the outer years because t h e h i s t o r i c a l scenario 
im p l i e s faster g r ow t h and a sma l ler ex terna l de f ic i t . T h e h i s t o r i c a l scenario shou ld be in terpre ted

4. T O T A L DEBT SUSTA INAB IL ITY

The trajectory o f total public debt contrasts with the previous DSA because i t reverses 

the decline observed in recent years. In the base l ine scenario, the NPV o f t o t a l p u b l i c deb t as a 
percentage o f GDP i s expected t o r ise until 2013 and dec l ine thereafter. In the p rev ious DSA i t was

ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS AND STRESS TESTS 

12. 
Although the macroframework i s robust to alternative assumptions and shocks, the 
DSA highlights the importance o f fiscal discipline. T h e a l terna t ive scenarios tested are68 (i) r e a l 

GDP and p r im a r y ba lance a t h i s t o r i c a l averages; (ii) p r im a r y ba lance unchanged f r o m 2008; and (iii) 

‘’ The hump-shaped path for the historical scenario (Figure 1, red dotted l i n e ) was preserved for completeness 
o f this DSA. However, it i s not informative because the baseline assumptions on the cu r ren t account and GDP 
p o w t h are more pessimistic than the historical scenario.

5. CONCLUSIONS 
14. 
The DSA concludes that the risk of debt distress i s low and highlights Cape Verde’s 
strengths as well as vulnerabilities. Even with ex treme shocks, p u b l i c deb t i s o n a sustainable path, 
g i v e n con t inued f i s c a l d i s c i p l i n e and the econom ic t rans fo rma t ion caused by expans ion o f service 
expor ts and FDI. W h i l e the dec l ine in p u b l i c deb t observed in recen t years i s b e i n g reversed, the 
D S A shows tha t using nonconcess iona l funds t o expand p u b l i c inves tmen t w i l l n o t jeopa rd ize debt 
sus ta inab i l i ty as l o n g as the expans ion i s tempo ra ry and recu r ren t expend i tures r em a i n con t ro l led . 
This conc lus ion h o l d s even if the expans ion o f p u b l i c inves tmen ts in in f ras t ruc tu re does n o t generate 
the expected g r ow t h returns, because n o g row th -enhanc ing e f f e c t o f in f ras t ruc tu re i s assumed. I t is , 
however, c r i t i c a l tha t Cape V e r d e strengthen i t s debt management. In par t icu lar , i t needs t o conduc t 
D S A s r e g u l a r l y t o set a b o r r ow i n g enve lope f o r the n e x t year’s budge t and a n MTFF consistent with

U Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing IS by 2 percentage points higher than in t h e baseline.. while grace and maturity per iods are the same as m the baseline. 
31 Exporn values are assumed to remam permanently a t t h e lower level, but the current account as a share o f GDP i s assumed to return to its baseline level after t h e shock (implicitly assummg an 
offsetting adjustment in import levels.) 
41 Includes official and pnvate transfers and FDI. 
51 Depreciation i s defined as pementage decline i n dollarflocal currency rate, such that i t never exceeds 100 percent. 
61 Negative numbers indicate interest rates higher the market rates Applies to all N e s s scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financmg) i n which the terms on a11 new financing are as specified in

Consultations on the Country Partnership Strategy 

1. 
The Bank carried ou t t w o j o i n t preliminary consultation meetings, in February and M a y 
o f 2008 respectively, with government, development partners, associations and p r iva te sector 
leaders in preparation o f this j o i n t Coun t ry Partnership Strategy. The Bank ca r r ied ou t a special 
consu l ta t ion mee t ing in September, 2008 , t o ob ta in preliminary feedback f r o m the stakeholders 
o n the current Strategy. 

2 . 
A comprehensive, b road consu l ta t ion was h e l d in the capital c i t y o f P ra ia f r o m January 
28 t o January 30, 2009 , in partnership and with the full support o f Dr. Manuel Pinheiro, General 
Planning D i rec to r o f the M i n i s t r y o f Finance, w h o made this j o i n t consu l ta t ion process o n the 
CPS possible and t o w h om the Bank t e a m i s very grateful. The Bank w o u l d also l i k e t o express 
i t s appreciation t o a l l the participants f o r their valuable insights and suggestions f o r the CPS. 

3 . 

The January 2009 Consultation was comprised o f four meetings with the following groups o f 
stakeholders and partners: public servants, civil society, academia, private sector and members o f the 
international cooperation community, including donors, lenders and representatives from State 
Embassies. Consultation meetings were attended by around 105 participants and organized into four 
sessions, distributed as follows: a) January 2 8 , afternoon, public servants and special guests: 53 , b) 
January 2 9 , morning and afternoon, two sessions with civil society, academia and private sector: 2 8 
attendees, and, January 30, one morning session with the international community, with 2 4 attendees 
including the Ambassadors o f China, France and the United States. Meetings were held at the Ministry o f 
Finance (day one), Instituto Nac iona l de Economia e Negdcios (day two) and a t the United Nations House 
(day three). A l l meetings were opened by Dr. Manuel Pinheiro, followed by a powerpoint presentation by 
the Bank‘s coordinator for the consultations, Ms. Zezk Weiss, contributions by the participants and a joint 
closing by Dr. Pinheiro and Ms. Weiss. 

4. 

Overall, a l l groups welcomed the Consultations initiative, congratulated the Bank and the 
Government fo r the effort, and pointed out that this was the f i r s t time that a larger group o f members o f 
Cape Verde’s society were invited to comment on a document such as the CPS, and that this process 
should be continued. The Consultations confirmed that the Authorities, the development partners and the 
representatives from civil society organizations a l l agree on the comparative advantage o f the Bank’s 
support to the Economic Transformation Agenda, notably by supporting reforms and investments towards 
enhancing infrastructure services and fostering private sector development in Cape Verde. I n addition, the 
Bank i s seen as being well positioned to help the country identify new sources and develop the required 
financial mechanisms to attract private investors and to promote partnership with international 
cooperation. The consultations also highlighted the importance o f ensuring donor complementarity, 
particularly to ensure that there i s continued support from other partners for the social areas and sectors 
from which the Bank, in agreement with the Cape Verdean Government, i s withdrawing i t s direct support. 

5 . 

Mo re specifically, the four sessions o f the January 2 0 0 9 Consultation process provided the Bank 
and Government with the following general contributions. and suggestions to enhance the quality o f the 
CPS: 

Environmental Vu lnerab i l i ty : The CPS document barely touches on environmental issues. Given 
that Bank support i s moving towards Energy, State Machine Strengthening and Infrastructure, a 
deeper insight into the environment could help provide the current line o f support with a more 

92 

sustainable range o f programs and action plans. There were strong suggestions, particularly a t the 
partners’ meeting, that the CPS should include the environment as a transversal point which could 
be incorporated throughout the whole document. 
Infrastructure, Energy and Roads: I t was suggested that a new paragraph between actual 
paragraphs 65 and 66 could be included, and to read as follows: “In spite o f the impressive 
modernization o f Cape Verde roads network, there are still roads to be rehabilitated or upgraded, as 
a response to the two remaining main problems: a) roads that are important as pre-conditions for 
economic development such as for enhancing tourism opportunities, and, b) ru ra l roads currently in 
bad shape and which are o f utmost importance for poverty alleviation and therefore roads which are 
socially justifiable, since the Government defined these two situations as c r i te r ia for prioritizing 
new road works in the Country. 
Development and Social Solidarity: Cape Verde’s c iv i l society strongly recommends that 
throughout t h e CPS a l l mentions of soc ia l solidarity should be complemented by the inclusion o f 
the Development word, s ince both the Cape Verdean Government and the society that i t represents 
are keen to moving beyond soc ia l solidarity, which i s important but needs to be upgraded to a more 
dynamic approach, which includes soc ia l inclusion and social cohesion as undistinguished parts o f 
the soc ia l development sought by Cape Verde. 
Competitiveness: Document needs further work on the business environment. Document needs to 
bring more clarity in regard to the Bank’s support for improving conditions for private sector 
interventions. Particularly, it needs to more detailed in relation to the specific support that i s to be 
provided to small, medium and large enterprises. Likewise, given the current world economic c r i s i s 
and i t s impact on Cape Verde, both tourism and remittance projections need to be revised. 
Fisheries Sector: Needs a more integrated approach which would include: (a) infrastructure; (b) 
research; (c) capacity building; (d) repairing o f current nets, including the establishment o f small 
offices in the islands for repairing small boats, and, (e) investment on development patterns for 
product quality. 
Tourism: no attention i s given to community alternatives, particularly to job creation in the 
craftshmall business areas. 
Housing: a Government priority which i s barely mentioned by the CPS. 
Job Creation: CPS needs a more detailed definition o f the nature and areas o f support that w i l l 
come from the Bank. 
Societal Organization: Within the framework o f support to State reforms, it i s essential that the 
CPS creates a space for the development o f a societal organization study and program, so that the 
relations between the State Government and its municipalities, its civil society, and i t s partners can 
be further development with c lear r u l e s which w i l l allow a l l to minimize partnership challenges and 
maximize partnership opportunities. 

Recommendations: Together with general comments on the CPS document, several specific 
recommendations were also provided at the meetings: 

An urgent study needs to be done on Societal Organization. 
Minor, ru ra l and socially justifiable roads should be included in the road package. 
Energy support needs to be broadened to include studies and programs on other sources o f 
alternative energy, and to incorporate attention to environmental issues in a l l activities. 
Document Data and Statistics: Need to be revised, particularly in regard to partners‘ contributions 
to the country. The Embassy o f Spain has an updated table on the subject, which can be requested. 
Feedback and Follow-Up on the Consultation: A l l four groups consulted were interested and 
requested that feedback be provided to their contributions. They emphasized the need for further 

93 

dialogues in order to provide both the Bank with stronger support through the implementation of 
the CPS. 
Finance, through this CPS, at least one complete integrated fishing system. 
Mon i to r ing , Evaluation and Dissemination: Mechanisms and strategies should be further developed 
and included as part o f the CPS document.
