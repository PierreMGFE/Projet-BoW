Poland - Country Partnership Strategy 2009-13 

I. INTRODUCTION 

1. 

This Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) sets out the country context, country 
development program, and envisaged World Bank program for Poland for the period 2009- 
13, the remaining five years o f the 2007-13 European Union (EU) financial perspective. I t 
also discusses the risks to this strategy and the planned consultations with Government and 
other partners. The CPS replaces the open-ended 2005 CPS, which has been superseded by 
recent crisis-related events in the global economy, although several aspects o f i t remain valid. 

2. 
The CPS should be viewed as a flexible tool to support the Bank’s work in Poland, in 
line with the strategy for middle-income countries (MIC). The Bank’s dialogue with Poland 
i s constantly evolving depending on external and domestic political and economic 
circumstances, and this strategy reflects more our current assessment o f priorities and 
potential for Bank engagement in Poland than a firmly agreed strategy and pipeline with the 
Government, at least beyond the first year. The Government i s interested in a continued 
partnership with the Bank, including both borrowing (at least in the current adverse external 
environment) and analytic and advisory Activities (AAA) drawing on the Bank’s global 
knowledge. I t i s envisaged that while lending may be increased significantly in the coming 
couple o f years, i t would be phased out gradually over the medium term. Meanwhile, AAA 
would be expected to increasingly be provided on a fee-for-service basis. 

3 . 
Although a secondary partner to the EU, the Bank can continue to add significant 
value t o Poland’s development and convergence agenda for many years to come, while its 
active policy dialogue and technical cooperation also benefits the Bank through enhancing i t s 
knowledge to the benefit o f other c l ien t countries both in the region and beyond. This i s thus 
a win-win relationship. 

4. 
A Regional Framework paper for the ten countries in the Central and South-Central 
Europe and the Baltic region i s under preparation. The Framework w i l l provide a broad 
diagnosis o f the key challenges facing the countries in the region; describe the Bank’s value- 
added; and outline the main areas o f Bank activity in the region. This Poland CPS shares 
common elements with the proposed Framework paper. 

11. COUNTRY CONTEXT 

A. Geopolitical Context, EU Relations. and Political Situation 

5 . 
Poland has successfully managed its integration into the EU since accession in 
2004. The EU and i t s institutions are now Poland’s main external partners, to which the 
World Bank i s committed to play a supporting role. Poland has access to considerable 
external financing, including large volumes o f EU Structural and Cohesion Funds on a grant 
basis and market financing (although absorption o f EU funds has been somewhat slow and 
market financing recently has become more difficult with the escalation o f the global 
economic and financial crisis). While external relations are anchored i n EU and North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) membership, for historical reasons Poland i s also 
seeking c loser t i e s with i t s Eastern neighbors, particularly with Ukraine to support closer 
integration with the EU and co-hosting o f the 2012 European Soccer Championship. 

1 

6. 
The majority Government, formed after elections in late 2007 by the Civic 
Platform (PO) and the Polish Peasant’s Party (PSL) and led by Prime Minister Donald 
Tusk of PO, has remained broadly stable and enjoys strong social support. Recent 
opinion polls show that support for the PO oscillates around 50 percent and that o f PSL 
around 5 percent. 

7. 

However, lack o f qualified majority in Parliament may make i t increasingly 
difficult fo r the Government to advance its reform program over the next year and a half 
as Presidential elections in f a l l 2010 approach. Consensus for major reform initiatives may 
not be achieved given the strong opposition Law and Justice (Pis) party which also occupies 
the Presidency. In some cases, such as the recent-tightening o f early retirement conditions, 
the Government was able to overcome a Presidential veto through support from the smaller 
opposition Social Democratic party. Elections to the European Parliament scheduled for 
mid-2009 and subsequent Local Government elections are expected to generate heated 
political debate. 

8. 

Poland does not have serious governance problems. Poland has a strong mu l t i - 
party democracy and a vibrant, f r e e press. Governance indicators suggest Poland i s in the 50- 
75* percentile in governance matters worldwide’ and roughly equal t o i t s peers in 
Transparency ratings.* Poland’s M in is t ry o f Interior and Administration prepared a national 
anti-corruption strategy i n 2002 and this i s updated regularly. Since 2006, the Central 
Anti-corruption Bureau has also been involved in anti-corruption activities, most recently 
focusing on prevention and education. 

B. Economic Developments, Labor Markets and Poverty 

9 . 
Poland 
i s being strongly affected by the deterioration in the external 
environment, but its vulnerability remains moderate. The in i t ia l position o f the Polish 
economy has been robust and able to face the repercussions o f the global crisis after five 
years o f strong growth and a historically low ‘unemployment rate. Meanwhile, inflation, the 
current account deficit and external debt as we l l as public debt are moderate, and the 
financial system i s relatively sound. While Poland avoided much o f the initial, direct 
financial market shock, i t i s being strongly affected by second-round effects through the real 
economy: declining demand for Polish exports, tightening o f credit conditions, and lower 
F D I inflows. The sharp weakening o f the zloty in the last quarter o f 2008 and early 2009 
showed that there i s l i t t l e room for complacency. 

10. 
Poland’s financial system i s well-poised to cope with the current adverse 
external environment. While the banking system i s dominated by foreign banks whose 
external funding conditions appear to have deteriorated ow ing to the problems in parent 
banks, there are also some significant domestic banks including a large state-owned bank. 
Further, credit growth in Poland and the overall level o f credit-to-gross domestic product 
(GDP) has been moderate and much lower than in most o f the other countries i n the region, 
and most o f the credit expansion has been financed through domestic deposits, although 
foreign financing has been playing an increasing role i n recent years. A large share o f 
domestic investment has been financed through en terpr ise profits. While there are some 
concerns related to foreign currency mortgage lending, the overall level o f lending i s 
relatively small and the recen t depreciation o f the zloty has taken place after the strong rea l 

’ World Governance Indicators 2008. 
Poland ranks 58‘h in Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index, equal to Lithuania and only 
slightly behind regional peers such as Hungary, Latvia and the Slovak Republic. 

2 

exchange rate appreciation in 2007 and much o f 2008. Bank profits have been record-high in 
recent years and a l l banks remain well-capitalized, Credit conditions are likely to tighten 
significantly this year and some enterprises may find i t difficult to roll-over maturing short- 
term loans (which constitute about one-half o f total enterprise loans). 

11. 
Growth has slowed sharply but could remain slightly positive in 2009 . Growth 
was expected to slow down for cyclical reasons, but while growth remained buoyant at close 
to 5 percent in the third quarter o f 2008, the economy slowed more sharply to l e s s than 3 
percent growth in the fourth quarter o f 2008 and 0.8 percent in the f i rs t quarter o f 2009 in 
connection with the worsening o f international financial and economic conditions. 
Investment growth has slowed sharply while consumption growth remains more resilient 
with continued real wage increases, only slowly increasing unemployment, and still robust 
credit growth. Poland i s less reliant on external demand than other, more open countries in 
the region and w i l l be relatively less affected by a recession in the euro area. I n 2009, the 
contribution o f net exports i s likely to remain broadly neutral as weaker prospects for exports 
w i l l be accompanied by moderation o f imports due to lower domestic absorption and 
exchange rate depreciation. Overall, in the best case scenario, growth could remain slightly 
positive at 0-1 percent in 2009. However, forecasts are subject to unusually large uncertainty 
in the current environment and there could be significant variations in growth in both 
directions, depending mainly on external developments (notably in the e~ ro -zone ) .~ 

12. 
The higher than planned Government consumption and lower than assumed 
non-tax revenues other than social contributions (largely EU funds) together with the 
slowdown in economic activity towards the end o f 2008 contributed to an unexpected 
increase in the fiscal deficit. The 2008 general Government f isca l deficit reached 3.9 
percent o f GDP, some 1.2 percentage points higher than projected by the Government in the 
December 2008 Convergence Program. This was due to higher-than-expected deficits o f both 
local and central Governments (due to higher than planned expenditure and lower than 
expected revenue), while social security funds performed according to plan. Poland i s very 
likely to enter the EU Excessive D e f i c i t Procedure, which i s triggered when the deficit-to- 
GDP ratio exceeds 3 percent or debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds 60 percent and which requires 
countries to produce a plan for how this w i l l be corrected. The EC initiated this process on 
May 13. 

13 . 

Inflation accelerated in 2008, but the peak was reached in August and inflation 
eased significantly as the c r is is escalated. With GDP growth expected to slow sharply i n 
2009 and world commodity prices falling, expectations for inflation have eased and the 
National Bank o f Poland (NBP) began reducing interest rates in late 2008. Inflation i s 
projected to return to around the middle o f the target range o f 1.5-3.5 percent in 2009 
although in April i t remained above the upper end o f the target range. 

14. 
The balance o f payments has come under some pressure but Poland’s external 
position remains relatively strong. The current account deficit widened slightly to 5 % 
percent o f GDP in 2008, while weaker capital inflows were associated with a sharp 
depreciation o f the zloty in late 2008 and early 2009 following strong appreciation in recent 
years. Following a hiatus o f seven months, the Government returned to international capital 
markets with a euro 1 billion issue in January at a spread o f about 300 basis points above 
German Bunds and 5-year m a t ~ r i t y . ~ 
I n early May, the issue was re-opened and Poland 

The IMF and EC project a decline in GDP o f 0 .7% and 1.4% in Poland, respectively. 

A t the end o f Ap r i l 2009 , the City o f Warsaw successfully placed a 5-year fixed rate euro-denominated bond 
o f EUR 200 million, priced at around 470 basis points above German Bunds. 

3 

successfully placed EUR750 million at a spread o f about 40 basis points below the January 
level. Poland’s external debt o f about 56 percent o f GDP i s moderate by regional standards, 
but gross financing needs are ~ i zeab le .~ However, the IMF precautionary Flexible Credit Line 
(FCL) arrangement o f USD 20.6 billion approved in May should safeguard against downside 
risks in financial markets. The ongoing economic slowdown and recent zloty depreciation 
should translate into a lower current account deficit (about 4 percent o f GDP in 2009). 
Inflows o f EU funds and FD I should finance a major part o f the external gap. I n current 
circumstances, Poland’s floating exchange rate regime i s serving i t well to help absorb the 
external shock. 

15 . 
After a remarkable improvement of labor market performance in recent years, 
unemployment i s expected to r i s e in 2009 on the back o f the economic slowdown. I n 
recent years, Poland recorded an unprecedented improvement o f labor market conditions. 
The Labor Force Survey (LFS) unemployment rate f e l l from over 20 percent in 2004 to about 
7 percent in 2008. The data disaggregated by gender indicate that female unemployment rates 
in Poland remain slightly higher than those for men, but also decreased considerably. 
Unemployment i s expected to rise back to over 10 percent this year in tandem with the 
economic slowdown. 

16. 

The decline in unemployment was associated with lower poverty. Relative 
poverty levels6 have decreased (see Chart 1) and are now concentrated in ru ra l areas and 
among the long-term unemployed. Nonetheless, despite vibrant growth o f rea l GDP and 
domestic consumption, Poland still has a relatively high poverty rate compared to other 
countries in the region, especially among children, although the 2004 reform to the family 
benefit system has led to an improvement i n the income status o f families with children, 
including single-parent families. Absolute poverty levels are considerably lower although 
measurement depends on the choice o f poverty line (see Box 1, Table 1).

About one-third o f external debt i s short term. Foreign currency reserves o f USD 64 b i l l ion (Ap r i l 2009 ) 
provide a cushion to absorb external pressures; covering about 95 percent o f short-term debt. 

The EU poverty measure (“at risk o f poverty”) i s defined as the share o f the population l iv ing i n households 
with income below 60 percent o f the national median disposable income after transfers.

BOX 1. POVERTY I N POLAND SINCE EU ACCESSION 

Household data available through 2007 show Poland’s substantial strides in lowering 
poverty. Poverty - measured as the percentage o f population below the social assistance 
income threshold - dropped from 19 percent in 2004 to 14.6 percent in 2007. The poverty 
gap also narrowed, meaning that the incomes o f the poor moved closer to those o f the non- 
poor. The main determinants o f poverty in Poland include rural residence, low educational 
attainment of a household head, unemployment o f a household member, and a large number 
o f children in the household. 

Poo re r households are generally well served by the social protection system. The 
multiple elements o f Poland’s social protection system (pensions, family benefits, and social 
assistance taken as a whole) cover 76 percent o f the population, and 95 percent o f the poorest 
20 percent. The system provides benefits to 98 percent o f households in extreme poverty. 
Reflecting the geography o f Poland’s poor areas, the system covers 81 percent o f the rural 
population (as compared to 73 percent o f the urban population). 

The Government’s growing concern i s f o r the newly vulnerable households i n the wake 
o f slowing economic growth. The Government i s planning targeted regional interventions to 
support the powiuts that are most affected by the drop i n economic activity by both 
improving the effectiveness o f existing programs (employment and social assistance 
programs) and, 
if necessary, by allocating additional resources and 
implementing 
extraordinary programs. 

Vulnerability to the cr is is i s being mapped to target interventions. This initiative has 
three components: first, the creation o f a regional c r i s i s vulnerability map to identify powiuts 
that are at the highest risk o f suffering from the current global economic cr is is ; second, 
implementation o f a monitoring system that w i l l screen powiuts that are actually hit by the 
crisis; and third, the creation o f an agency with a mandate to support the worst affected 
powiuts. The initiative w i l l be ready by September 2009 . The regions that are considered the 
most vulnerable to the c r i s i s are those with an export-oriented economy, rather than the poor, 
lagging regions. The latter - rural, predominantly agricultural regions - are insulated from 
the cr is is , at least temporarily, and well covered by existing social protection programs.

17. 
The authorities have taken steps to preserve financial stability in the current 
difficult external environment. I n reaction to the escalation o f the global c r i s is i n the f a l l o f 
2008, the NBP, the GovernmentParliament and the Financial Supervision Authority took 

5 

steps to maintain confidence and support the e f f e c t i v e functioning o f the financial system. I n 
October, the NBP announced a “package o f confidence” aimed at preserving trust and 
liquidity in financial markets through expansion o f its term liquidity management operations 
and foreign exchange swap operations. The European Central Bank (ECB) agreed to provide 
a EUR 10 billion rep0 facility. Further, the Parliament approved a b i l l raising the household 
deposit insurance limit from euro 22,500 to euro 50,000. Legislation regulating state 
guarantees for interbank deposits has been adopted by Parliament and i s currently awaiting 
the President’s approval. The NBP also introduced other measures supporting bank liquidity 
like early buy back o f T-bonds maturing in 2012 or extending the maturity o f rep0 
operations. I n la te November, the NBP started reducing interest ra tes (for the first time since 
March 2006), with a ser ies o f cuts bringing the ra te down from 6 percent in November to 
3.75 percent in May. 

18. Meanwhile, the Government has also moved to support the economy. I n la te 
November, the Government announced a 7 percent o f GDP “Plan for Stability and 
Development” aimed at supporting the economy in 2009-2010, including a doubling o f the 
l im i t on state guarantees, support for lending to small- and medium-size enterprises, 
acceleration o f investments co-financed from EU structural funds, new investments in 
renewable energy, already scheduled personal income tax cuts and value added tax (VAT) 
simplification, and creation o f a Reserve o f Social Solidarity to support people vulnerable to 
the projected economic slowdown (financed through higher luxury excise taxes). While some 
o f these measures were planned even before the cr is is , and new direct spending programs are 
only a smaller part o f this package, i t nevertheless constitutes an appropriate response to the 
c r is is i n a constrained f isca l environment. 

C . Medium-Term Economic and Fiscal Outlook 

19. 
The global financial cr is is has worsened Poland’s macroeconomic and fiscal 
outlook, although Poland i s faring better than other countries in the region. With fewer 
resources and in a fast evolving economic environment, the Government faces the difficult 
challenge o f reconciling three objectives: ensuring f isca l consolidation over the medium term 
as required under the EU Excessive D e f i c i t Procedure; protecting priority programs for 
economic and social development to enhance growth prospects; and mitigating the social 
costs o f the cr is is . The room for f isca l maneuver i s constrained both by the need to preserve 
public debt below levels that trigger corrective action according t o the Constitution and the 
Government’s aim to jo in the euro-zone in 2012 (discussed in more detail below). 

20. 
Growth i s projected to recover only slowly in 2010 in tandem with the expected 
easing o f the c r i s i s and expected slow recovery in industrialized countries. Growth i s 
likely to remain subdued through 2010, with most projections around 1 percent, before a 
stronger recovery in 201 1. Inflation i s expected to remain stable at around the central 
inflation target o f 2.5 percent. Lower domestic absorption should lead to a significant 
moderation o f imports and an improvement in the external current account deficit (around 4 
percent o f GDP in 2009-2010). Table 1 shows the recent macroeconomic forecasts for 
Poland prepared by the Government and international organizations. Needless to say, 
projections for next year are even more uncertain than for this year.

Against this background, the fiscal position i s likely to weaken further in 2009 

2 1. 
and possibly 2010. The Government i s trying to adhere to f isca l targets for the state budget, 
while financing infrastructure investment through extra-budgetary borrowing and allowing 
automatic stabilizers to operate i n the rest o f the general Government (social security funds 
and local Governments). I n late January 2009 , the Government revised downwards the 2009 
rea l GDP growth forecast from 3.7 percent, as estimated in the December 2008 Convergence 
Program, to 1.7 percent. To compensate for the expected shortfall in revenue, line ministries 
were asked to prepare plans for reducing state budget expenditures by 0.8 percent o f GDP. 
Certain expenditure items, such as pension and disability payments, capitation grants to local 
Governments for primary and secondary education, public sector wages, debt servicing, and 
co-financing for the absorption o f EU funds, were protected from these reductions. I n 
addition, the Government shifted transport infrastructure spending o f 0.8 percent o f GDP o f f 
the state budget to the National Road Funde7 With growth prospects further weakening, a 
formal amendment o f the budget i s expected in June/July. This could include a combination 
o f additional expenditure rationalization and possibly an increase in the state budget deficit 
target. The Government i s now projecting the general Government f i s c a l deficit to reach 4.6 
percent o f GDP in 2009 .8 

’ While this measure reduces the state budget deficit, i t leaves the general Government deficit unchanged. 
* This i s slightly higher than the IMF but lower than the EC which expects a deficit o f 6.6 percent o f GDP (but 
this assumes to corrective action).

22. 
The 2010 budget will need to strike a careful balance between maintaining 
reasonable fiscal discipline as required under the EU excessive deficit procedure and 
necessary for euro adoption, and supporting the recovery. I t i s too early to judge the 
appropriate f isca l stance for next year, but i t w i l l be c r i t i ca l for the budget to be placed in a 
strong, Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) consistent with renewed f isca l 
consolidation that targets an ambitious reduction in the structural f i s c a l deficit, at least 
stabilizes public debt, and supports euro adoption. This commitment should be institutionally 
strengthened by rapid passage o f the amendment to the Public Finance Law aimed at 
enhancing the MTEF,' consolidating budgetary units, strengthening precautionary debt rules, 
and increasing performance-orientation in the budget. Given the recent lowering o f taxes and 
the expenditure pressures arising from the need to protect or expand productive spending in 
e.g. infrastructure and education and to strengthen social safety nets during the downturn, 
medium-term f i s c a l consolidation w i l l require ambitious expenditure reforms aimed at 
rationalizing unproductive and inefficient spending programs, including i n health and 
remaining privileged pension arrangements. 

23. 

Analysis done by the IMF in the context o f the F C L suggests that public debt i s 
sustainable over the medium term even in the presence o f moderate further shocks. Fiscal 
rules on public debt - embedded in the Polish Public Finance Law - prompt corrective action 
when public debt reaches 50 and 5 5 percent o f GDP and there i s the 60 percent o f GDP cap 
imposed by the Constitution. 

Further efforts w i l l be needed going forward to establish a truly strong MTEF .

24 . 

Poland's economic and fiscal outlook remains subject to unusually large 
uncertainty in view o f the unclear prospects fo r global economic recovery. While the 
fo rce fu l policy responses i n many countries have contained the risks o f a systemic financial 
meltdown, there are reasons to remain concerned about the potential impact on activity o f the 
financial c r i s i s . The process o f deleveraging could be more protracted than has been factored 

9 

 
into the macroeconomic projections for emerging markets. Another risk relates to the 
growing risks o f deflationary conditions in advanced economies. Maintaining or accelerating 
the reform momentum w i l l be key to both ensuring a rapid return to high growth and further 
enhancing the growth potential o f the economy over the medium term. 

BOX 2. SUPPORTING H I G H AND SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH I N POLAND OVER THE MEDIUM TERM 

Although recent economic performance has been impressive, Poland still faces important growth constraints 
which may slow down the real convergence process over the medium-long term. I n 2007, Poland’s GDP per capita at 
purchasing power parity amounted to 53.6 percent o f the average for the EU-27. A continued rapid reduction o f the 
income gap requires high and sustainable growth based on sustained productivity increases and higher employment and 
investment rates. 
There i s broad consensus (including among the Wor ld Bank, the EC , the International Monetary Fund (IMF), 
and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)) that policy interventions aimed at 
promoting high and sustainable growth should be focused on the following three broad areas: 
(a) P u b l i c f i n a n c e a n d adm in is t ra t ive reform. Pub l ic f inance a n d adm in is t ra t ive reforms a imed a t con t inued J isca l 
consolidation, lowe r ing of 
the tax burden, re -o r ien ta t ion of spending towa rds mo re p roduc t ive a reas , imp roved pub l ic 
f inance managemen t , a n d enhanced pub l ic adm in is t ra t ion . Further fiscal consolidation i s needed to improve 
macroeconomic stability and provide room for countercyclical fiscal policy. A lower tax burden and simpler tax system 
i s needed to encourage formal private sector activity. A re-orientation and restructuring o f spending i s needed to provide 
fiscal space for increased productive spending, notably on infrastructure, and improved outcomes o f key public services 
(including health and education). Public administration reforms are needed to support more efficient management and 
service delivery, including better policy coordination. This should include reforming and modernizing Poland’s courts 
(which a re a source o f major delay for business transactions) and enhancing the capacity and results-orientation o f the 
c iv i l service and the public administration at a l l levels o f Government. 
(b) S t r u c t u r a l reforms. P romo t ing p r iva te sector development th rough a n imp roved investment c l ima te , h ighe r p roduc t 
ma rke t j l e x i b i l i f y , a n d res t ruc tu r ing of key sectors. Structural reforms are needed to improve the general investment 
climate and support the restructuring o f low-productivity sectors. Poland ranks low on Doing Business Indicators even 
among its regional peers, and further deregulation i s needed. This should include a simplification o f Poland’s onerous 
legal, tax and administrative environment for entrepreneurship and business development. Licensing requirements and 
business startup regulations are particularly burdensome. I n addition, the Government could facilitate the continued shift 
away from o ld industrial and low-productivity sectors to new job-rich, high-productivity sectors. This would include 
restructuring sectors such as coal or energy generation and removing incentives for people to remain i n low-productivity 
agriculture while accelerating the privatization process (including i n what are considered strategic sectors). The 
Government could also further support the high productivity sectors by promoting private sector research and 
development. 

(C) L a b o r supply mob i l iza t ion . Inc reas ing labo r fo rce pa r t ic ipa t ion a n d employment inc lud ing t o fu r the r reduce pove r fy 
a n d encourage soc ia l inclusion. Labor supply mobilization i s needed to ra ise low employment rates, not least among the 
older cohorts and women, and improve the skills o f the workforce. This requires reform o f the system o f social 
protection and labor taxation in order to enhance incentives to work along w i th development o f more flexible forms o f 
employment, improved active labor market programs targeted at disadvantaged worker groups and promotion o f l i f e - 
long learning. L im i t ing the number o f professions entitled to early retirement would be i n line w i th the principles o f the 
pension reform introduced in 1999 and i n support o f increased labor force participation. Continued reforms i n the 
education system are also needed to improve labor market relevance and skills. 

111. COUNTRY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM 

A. Overarching Obiectives 

25 . 

R a p i d rea l convergence to average EU l iv ing standards rema ins the overarch ing 
policy objective and the Gove rnmen t sees jo in ing the euro-zone as soon as possible as a 
centra l strategy i n this regard . Euro adoption i s one of the key elements and obligations o f 
a l l the N M S , and countries that do not satisfy the Maastricht criteria in this regard are 
required to prepare Convergence Programs that show how and when these criteria w i l l be 
met. The Government sees rapid euro adoption as key to maximizing the gains from 
European integration and minimizing the risks associated with rapid capital flows and 

10 

potential currency mismatches. I t also provides an important anchor for the conduct o f f isca l 
policy and thus critical element i n preserving market confidence during the ongoing cr is is . 
Further, f isca l discipline allows for an easier monetary policy. Euro adoption requires 
amendment o f the Constitution, which in turn would require qualified majority support in 
Parliament. 

26. 
I n September 2008, the Government announced 2012 as the target year fo r euro 
adoption, but acknowledges that there may be a short delay as a result o f the c r is is . 
Earlier plans to enter the ERM2 in mid-2009 have been abandoned on the background o f 
increased foreign exchange market volatility, a worse than expected f isca l outturn in 2008, 
and difficulties gathering the required support in Parliament for changing the Constitution. 
The Government now hopes that these problems w i l l be overcome la te r i n the year. While i t 
i s possible to enter the ERM2 prior to changing the Constitution, this would add an 
undesirable element o f uncertainty to the process. Euro adoption in 2012 would require that 
the general Government f isca l deficit i s reduced to below 3 percent o f GDP in 2010, which 
now looks very difficult. 

27. 
The Government i s also seeking to accelerate structural reforms. Economic 
policy objectives in the medium-term were identified by the Government in the March 2008 
CP and confirmed in the December 2008 Update o f the program. These objectives are: (i) 
reduction o f the tax burden; (ii) increase o f growth-enhancing expenditure (infrastructure, 
science, education, and research and development (R&D)), shifting social spending towards 
programs supporting growth o f economic activity, and changes in health and pensions aimed 
at enhancing efficiency; ( i i i) increase o f labor activity; ( iv ) economic liberalization 
(elimination o f obstacles to doing business, administration reform, and better functioning o f 
judiciary); and (v) acceleration o f privatization. These objectives are fully consistent with the 
key impediments to growth identified in Box 2 above. I n addition to these objectives, the 
National Development Strategy 2007- 13 includes regional and rural development and 
increased territorial cohesion. 

28. 
The main strategy fo r offsetting the fiscal costs o f tax and pension/labor market 
reforms i s based on general expenditure control, with only small nominal increases in 
budgetary allocations across line ministries, along with increases in indirect taxes 
(notably excises on alcohol, tobacco, and cars). There i s significant scope for rationalization 
o f administrative spending in line ministries, without adversely affecting core and mandated 
spending programs, but a more strategic restructuring o f public expenditures to enhance the 
quality o f public finances i s needed. 

B. Government Priorities 

29. 
As mentioned above, the priorities o f the Government are to improve the 
structure o f public finances, increase employment, and promote private sector 
development. The key plans in the various areas include: 

Public sector reform 
0 Reducing the tux burden: overall, changes are oriented towards shifting the tax 
burden from direct to indirect taxes. I n 2009 , the Personal Income Tax i s being 
simplified and reduced, along with other changes to support taxpayers working 
abroad, while Corporate Income Tax i s being be lowered for producers o f bio- 
components. I n indirect taxes, simplified procedures are being introduced in VAT, 
while excise duties on tobacco products are being hiked in line with EU requirements 
and in order to finance the recently created Reserve o f Social Solidarity. 

11 

e 

Increase in and greater eflciency of growth-enhancing expenditure: the Government 
i s planning significant investments in transport, particularly in road construction and 
rehabilitation to offset the projected slowdown in private investment. A broader 
program o f infrastructure investment w i l l support 
the Euro 2012 Soccer 
Championship to be hosted by Poland and Ukraine. Associated with this program, 
Poland w i l l streamline and enhance its regulatory and legal framework as well public 
procurement practices. The Government i s also planning a shift towards a low-carbon 
economy both in order to comply with international and EU long-term policies on 
climate change mitigation and to preserve energy security. Opportunities for 
emissions reduction or carbon sequestration in agriculture, transport or forestry and to 
tap new climate-related sources o f financing w i l l be explored. 

Reforms 
in education and health aim to increase efficiency and effectiveness: in 
education, curriculum reforms in upper secondary w i l l integrate general and 
vocational education and make teaching more relevant for the job market. High- 
quality early education, which has a widely recognized and well-documented impact 
on education outcomes, w i l l be expanded as w i l l pre-school education through 
increased flexibility for non-publicly managed institutions. Reforms in health aim to 
improve resource mobilization and increase efficiency in resource allocation with 
improved service delivery. The reforms include rationalization and corporatization o f 
public hospitals and reform to the single health insurance system to introduce 
competition among public and private insurers. Subsequent phases would include 
developing a risk-equalization mechanism between insurers, establishing an 
independent regulatory authority, and creating independent insurance supervisory 
bodies with oversight o f the insurance and provider market. The Government i s also 
analyzing managed-care models. 

Public finance management. Poland has made substantial progress in the last three 
years in performance budgeting. An indicative performance budget-including a 
programmatic breakdown o f expenditures, program objectives, and key performance 
indicators-is 
now presented to the Parliament for information alongside the 
traditional annual budget. Further improvements are underway in public financial 
management to support f isca l consolidation and enhancing the quality o f public 
finances: a new Law on Public Finance i s expected i n la te 2009 and i s associated with 
organizational changes to make the budget more transparent and performance- 
oriented while strengthening the medium-term orientation o f the budget through 
introduction o f a multi-year State financial plan. The Law would also tighten 
corrective measures triggered by increases in public debt, and expenditure control 
would be strengthened through new regulations on internal control and external audit. 

e 

Private sector development 
Improving the business climate: the tax burden on labor i s being reduced (see above) 
and onerous legal, tax and administrative obstacles for entrepreneurship are being 
reviewed and streamlined. Reform proposals include amendments to the laws on the 
freedom o f economic activity and accounting. Work i s underway on a package o f 
laws aimed at facilitating the start-up and closure o f a business, reducing red tape, 
simplifying licensing and inspection procedures, and enhancing tax administration. 
Building an electronic administration i s also an important part o f the planned 
changes . 

12 

0 P r iva t iza t ion : the Government aims to s e l l state shares in more than 700 enterprises 
over the coming three years, although the program may move more slowly than 
envisaged given curren t market conditions. The Government i s also keen to explore 
options for Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) to help finance the large infrastructure 
investment program. 

0 

Labor market 
Increase i n labor mob i l i ty : the Government plans to reduce inactivity incentives 
created by social transfers and associated taxes. The tax wedge on labor has already 
been substantially reduced, while a new program, known as “Intergenerational 
Solidarity - 50+” includes incentives to stimulate labor force participation o f older 
workers through a tightening o f early retirement provisions and “bridge pensions”. A 
new law to regulate the payment o f second-pillar pensions was proposed along w i th a 
law on individual pension accounts (third pillar) that would double the annual l im i t o f 
savings for retirement exempted from capital gain taxation. Active programs include 
enhancing workforce sk i l ls , developing life-long learning, reforming labor market 
intermediation services, more effective active labor market programs, supporting 
post-natal re-entry into the labor force and social campaigns to promote longer 
working lives. 

Iv. WORLD BANK PROGRAM 

A. Imdementation o f 2005 CPS and Lessons Learned 

30. 
The CPS did not adequately differentiate the Bank’s potential r o l e from that o f 
other development partners. Fo l low ing EU accession, a range o f other financing sources 
were available to the Polish authorities, including grants from the EU and loans from 
regional institutions and development banks. The CPS for Poland d id not situate the Bank’s 
role and comparative advantage clearly w i th in this context, and as a result, the Bank’s 
potential contribution to Poland’s development goals was not clear. 

31. 
The flexibility inherent in the CPS design was appropriate but did not facilitate 
a focused o r strategic dialogue. The CPS was designed as a menu o f options for the Polish 
Government. This f lex ib i l i ty was appropriate for a M I C that had just gone through a major 
transition by jo in ing the EU and for which client interest in a relationship w i th the Bank was 
uncertain. However, the menu o f options le f t the dialogue w i th the Government o f Poland 
somewhat open and unfocussed, which hindered a strategic dialogue or implementation o f a 
coherent program. While the CPS aimed to move the Poland program beyond traditional 
Investment Loans by introducing Sector Wide Approach (SWAPS), i t did not pave the way 
for a new type o f relationship w i th a M I C that was based on the Bank’s knowledge services. 

32. 
Implementation o f the CPS was also hindered by successive changes in 
counterparts. The CPS period was marked by several changes o f Government. As a result, 
the dialogue and the program lacked an anchor at the heart o f Government. There was l i t t l e 
in the CPS to guide the relationship through changes in commitment or interest from the 
authorities. 

33. 

The following lessons may be drawn: 

0 Define the Bank’s role and value added: 

13 

o Establish clearly the Bank’s role and value-added vis-&-vis other external 
partners and funding sources such as the EU, European Investment Bank 
(EIB), EBRD and OECD; 
o Practice selectivity in Bank involvement in terms o f areas o f involvement and 
modalities o f support, focusing on the knowledge agenda; 
o Test Bank involvement against the c r i te r ia defined as areas o f Bank value- 
added, strategic relevance and impact. 

0 Establish a flexible framework o f activities that can be scaled up o r down 
according to client interest: 
o Establish a strategic and cohesive program o f Bank activities that i s not 
wholly dependent upon one counterpart or one instrument; 
o Maintain a core set o f Economic and Sector Work (ESW) and diagnostic 
products as a basis for scaling up or developing new ac t iv i t ies ; 
o Be prepared to scale down or disengage i f the Bank’s involvement i s 
perceived to lack strategic focus or impact and switch gradually to a 
knowledge-based partnership through reimbursement agreements. 

0 Manage political transitions: 
o Seek continuity o f dialogue by developing relations at technical levels o f the 
c iv i l service; 
o Maintain contacts across the political spectrum and with strategic non- 
Government partners and sub-national entities; 
o To the extent possible, align CPS and programming cycles around electoral 
cycles. 

34. 

These lessons have been incorporated into the design o f this CPS: 

o Complementarity and Value-Added: The Bank’s value-added has been explicitly 
defined in this CPS (see below) and these definitions are used as criteria to t e s t and 
select areas o f Bank engagement. For example, while EIB tends to provide larger, 
faster funds for infrastructure construction, the Bank w i l l focus on a complementary 
role with smaller investments in institutional capacity, preparatory work, regulatory 
and safety issues. Another example would be focusing the Bank on implementation o f 
standards and goals that are defined by the European Commission (EC). 

o Flexibility: The last CPS started with an open menu o f options, which made it 
difficult to anchor the program. This CPS program i s well-defined in the near term 
and left more flexible in the outer years. I n the first year o f the CPS, the program i s 
anchored with a DPL s e r i e s and a few innovative operations supporting economic 
activity during the c r i s i s and the longer-term development agenda. This i s 
underpinned by core ana ly t ica l work, such as a Public Expenditure Review (PER) and 
a Climate Change Economic Memorandum. In the outer years o f the CPS, the 
program w i l l develop i n some o f the areas outlined as Strategic Pillars o f 
Collaboration (see below) and the mid-term CPS Progress Report w i l l further define 
the particular areas and operations proposed. The lending program could be scaled 
down i f the crisis abates more rapidly than anticipated and demand for borrowing 
declines while the non-lending program could be scaled up i f there i s client interest 
and willingness to pay. This i s described in the Proposed Program section (see 
below). 

14 

o Manag ingpo l i t ica l transitions: While not necessarily clear in the CPS document, the 
Poland team’s engagement strategy r e f l e c t s these lessons - communications take 
place with a l l levels o f Government and are inclusive o f stakeholders from a l l 
political parties and spectrum o f society (see Consultations section below). Further, 
close relations have been established with staff at the Ministry o f Finance, which i s 
acting as the focal point for relations with the Bank and helps coordinate activities 
with line ministries. 

B. External Partners and Key Areas o f World Bank Value-Added 

35 . 

The EU and EU-related institutions have become Poland’s main external 
partners. The EU has committed 67 billion euro in grants to Poland over the period 2007-1 3, 
equivalent to about 2.5 percent o f Poland’s GDP per year, to support income convergence o f 
the country and i t s regions with the wealthier parts o f Europe. This support i s focused on 
development o f a knowledge economy and infrastructure (see Box 3 below). The EIB i s also 
playing an important role in providing required co-financing for the EU structural and 
cohesion funds through loans on attractive terms, and his stepped up its lending substantially 
in recent years with further increases envisaged in response to the ongoing global financial 
and economic c r i s i s . The EIB has traditionally focused on infrastructure (especially 
transport) projects, but has become more involved i n other sectors o f the economy as well as 
sub-national lending. The EIB intends to step up its support for energy efficiency projects as 
part o f the EU climate change agenda. Meanwhile, the EBRD has largely phased out o f 
Poland and the Central Europe region, although this i s changing again in response to the 
cr is is . 

36. 
I n the medium term, the International Finance Corporation ( IFC ) will continue 
its current selective strategy to support the entry o f Polish companies into less 
developed markets o f the Commonwealth o f Independent States (CIS) and Southern 
Europe. I n some cases, Poland may provide an opportunity to invest in innovative structures 
or products. IFC w i l l also explore opportunities in climate change related projects. I n the 
financial sector, IFC i s supporting a specialized microfinance bank in order to improve 
access to credit by micro enterprises and SMEs and stimulate their expansion and new job 
creation. Strengthening micro enterprises and SMEs w i l l also 
fac i l i ta te greater 
competitiveness o f the economy. I n addition, as part o f the Joint IF1 Action Plan for Central 
and Eastern Europe launched in February 2009 with the EBRD and the EIB, the IFC and 
M IGA are poised to play a more active role in supporting Poland’s banking sector and 
lending to the rea l economy. 

37. 
The Bank can still add significant value to Poland’s development agenda in a 
number o f areas within the domain o f the Bank’s broader institutional and regional 
strategic priorities and as a complement to EU programs. The Bank can play an 
important role in helping to address global and regional public goods and in exchanging 
knowledge on global development lessons. I t can also complement the EU’s Lisbon Agenda 
(LA) in support o f growth and competitiveness and public sector reform, and i t can be a key 
partner on social sector reform-an 
area 
largely excluded from the EU Acquis 
Communautaire and EU-support programs-and 
in the discussion o f regional development 
policy, a l l drawing on i t s long-standing engagement in Poland in these areas and i t s global 
knowledge. Both the Government and the EU thus see a continued important role for the 
Bank to play. A t the same time, a continued engagement with Poland i s important for the 
Bank in that the knowledge acquired and lessons learned are likely to be o f value for other, 
less-advanced clients in the region and beyond.

(EBRD) has been present i n Poland 
s ince 1992. B y the end o f 2007, EBRD 
had contributed EUR 3.3 b i l l ion to 
more than 190 projects o f a total value 
exceeding EUR 13 billion. EBRD 
assisted Poland in its economic 
transition and the restructuring o f 
enterprises i n different sectors from 
agribusiness to steel. After Poland 
joined the EU, EBRD has focused its 
activities around the enterprise and 
financial sector, as well as 
infrastructure and environment, but 
new commitments have declined 
substantially.

The International Monetary Fund 

I n the context o f the ongoing financial and economic crisis, the Fund plays an important r o l e in Poland. 
In addition to the regular Article I V consultations, the FCL arrangement i n the amount o f SDR 13.69 b i l l ion 
(about USD20.6 b i l l ion and 1000 percent o f quota) approved by the I M F Board i n early May 2009 i s central to 
the Fund involvement in Poland. The FCL i s treated as a precautionary arrangement. Moreover, the Fund 
provides just-in-time technical assistance i n the area o f Public Finance Management focused on introduction o f 
the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). 

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development 

The OECD does regular macroeconomic monitoring and forecasting and occasional analytical work on 
structural reforms (including education) and other issues such as regional development, climate change. I t also 
conducts regular bi-annual country reports for Poland covering important issues o f structural agenda. 

C. Strategic Pillars o f Collaboration 

38 . 

The Bank’s envisaged strategic partnership with Poland would be based on four 

pillars: (i) Social and Spatial Inclusion; (ii) Public Sector Reform; (iii) Growth and 
Competitiveness; and (iv) Regional and Global Public Goods. Key policy areas identified 
within these broader themes would include social sector reform, regional development, 
public finance and financial management reform, transport infrastructure development, 
deregulation and the enabling environment for doing business, climate change (notably 
focused on the energy sector), and f inanc ia l sector stability. I n the short term, particular 
attention would be given to supporting adequate social safety nets during the economic 
downturn, interventions aimed at supporting private sector credit growth and SME access to 
finance, and infrastructure investments, while not losing sight o f the reforms needed to 
support strong and high quality growth over the medium-long t e rm . While this i s s t i l l a fairly 
broad agenda, these are a l l critical areas o f the development agenda where the Bank can add 
important value, and i t i s necessary to preserve some flexibility in the program, especially 
beyond the first year, as Government priorities for collaboration w i th the Bank evolve. 
Lending and strategic AAA would be limited to a narrower subset o f core areas, while in 
other areas i t i s envisaged that collaboration would rely increasingly on fee-for-service. 

17 

Pillar 1: Social and Spatial Inclusion 

Social Sectors Reform 

3 9 . 
Pursuing the EU Lisbon Agenda o f making Poland a competitive, knowledge- 
based economy with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion requires reforms 
in the social sectors in order to improve the utilization o f labor resources, including raising 
labor participation rates among women, and to increase the productivity o f the workforce. 
This involves increasing the employment-to-population ratio (which at 57 percent i s well 
below the Lisbon target o f 70 percent), enhancing social inclusion (including the reduction in 
the incidence o f long-term unemployment), improving the quality o f and access to education 
and promoting the responsiveness o f the education system to the fas t changing labor market 
needs, and enhancing labor productivity through better health services. 

0 Labor Ma rke t and Social Protection. The employment rate i s low in Poland mainly 
due to very low labor force participation o f older workers (which at 29 percent i s well 
below the Lisbon target o f 50 percent) and women. This r e f l e c t s disincentives created 
by the social security system. Recent reforms to the pension system," which aimed at 
substantially reducing early retirement options, are likely to result in more favorable 
employment outcomes among older workers. However, more needs to be done, 
including lower subsidization o f the farmers' soc ia l security system (KRUS), limiting 
access to disability pensions, developing the system o f adult education to equip older 
workers with the required skills, and promoting flexible forms o f employment. 
Moreover, in order to encourage employers to hire older workers, the generous 
employment protection provisions granted to this worker group need to be revised. 
Reaching the 
fu l l employment target also requires improving labor market 
adaptability so as to reduce the effects o f adverse demand shocks on employment and 
unemployment. This entails, among other things, the need for greater working time 
and wage flexibility. Furthermore, addressing labor market exclusion - which 
manifests itself in the relatively high incidence o f long-term unemployment - requires 
implementing activation policies and improving the human capital o f the long-term 
unemployed. The cost-effectiveness and targeting o f existing active labor market 
programs needs to improved, as does the coordination between employment and 
social welfare offices. Finally, women face additional labor constraints due to the role 
they perform as primary care providers to children and elderly. 

Educa t ion reform. I n education, the main challenge continues to be the relevance o f 
skills for the labor market. I n this regard, reforms in secondary education have been 
successful in expanding and improving general secondary instruction while delaying 
vocational schooling. Continuing and deepening these reforms i s 
important. 
Moreover, to increase the availability o f financial resources for quality investments in 
primary and secondary education, Poland w i l l need to increase the flexibility o f 
teacher management and deployment to respond to the rapid demographic changes 
that are reducing the size o f student cohorts. A t the same time, i t i s c r i t ica l to revise 
the financing mechanisms in tertiary education to make the system more equitable 
and fiscally sustainable. Furthermore, Poland would be well advised to phase in 
mandatory schooling from age six and to expand coverage and improve efficiency o f 

lo Unlike many EU countries, Poland's pension system appears to be generally sustainable i n the long run. First 
pillar deficits are expected to fa l l over time, and second p i l lar pensions have earned healthy rates o f return since 
the inception o f the mu l t ip i l lar system i n 1999. The projections o f system balances have to be verified, though, 
and there are concerns about the adequacy o f future pensions. 

18 

preschool education. At the, other end o f the education cycle, a platform for life-long 
learning and a strategy for adult training should be developed. 
0 Health sector reform. T h e key challenges o f health sector reforms i n Poland are to 
achieve higher efficiency i n resource allocation along with improved service delivery. 
The health system i s well placed to protect the vulnerable during the economic 
downturn as well as to protect critical public health programs. The efficiency agenda 
includes both debt management and provider payment reform. With important 
exceptions, hospitals have consistently accumulated public debts (failure to pay social 
security and other taxes) and commercial debts (mainly to suppliers). The current 
Government i s aiming to solve this problem permanently through an initiative to 
corporatize hospitals under commercial law, but this w i l l be done initially using a 
voluntary approach. Close monitoring w i l l be required for hospitals that are unlikely 
to be corporatized but for which debt accumulation has been a persistent problem, as 
well as for hospitals affiliated with universities. I n addition, Poland has implemented 
DRGs (Diagnosis Related Groups) as a cost accounting mechanism in a l l f a c i l i t i e s in 
2009 . Further, the corporatization o f hospitals w i l l allow the Ministry o f Health 
(MOH) and NHF to improve the regulatory framework under which hospitals and 
clinics operate. Other reform areas, including introduction o f a multiple competitive 
private insurance system and expansion o f long-term care services, are seen as more 
medium-term challenges. 

40. 
The Bank i s uniquely positioned to assist Poland in building capacity to address 
the challenges posed by the Lisbon Agenda and in developing the implementation 
strategy The Lisbon Agenda identified four priority areas: 
investing in people and 
modernizing labor markets, unlocking the business potential, investing in knowledge and 
innovation, and energy and climate change. These priorities correspond closely to the Bank’s 
strategic development pillars, which makes the Bank and the EU natural partners. This i s 
particularly the case given that the Lisbon Agenda, despite great e f fo r ts to re-focus i t in terms 
o f goals and policy areas, provides limited practical guidance on what to do and, more 
importantly, how to do it. Such capacity i s c r i t i ca l since sizable amounts o f EU structural and 
cohesion funds are linked to the implementation o f reforms related to the Lisbon strategy 
(some 60 percent o f cohesion policy funds for EUlO w i l l be targeted for activities and 
investments intended to meet Lisbon targets). 

41. 
I n recent years, the Bank has provided extensive support to the Government on 
social sector reforms through investment lending, development policy lending, and AAA . 
The 2008 DPL-1 contained a labor market component that aimed at improving labor supply 
incentives and increasing the labor force participation rate, especially among older workers. 
I n addition, Bank s ta f f contributed to a government policy paper on priorities for labor 
market reforms, which provided the analytical underpinnings for the DPL- I , I n education, 
the Bank has engaged in policy dialogue through a Technical Cooperation program with the 
Ministry o f National Education and the Ministry o f Sc ience and Higher Education. I n both 
cases, the program i s focused on providing ana ly t ica l and policy support fo r designing and 
implementing key reforms in the education sector. One example i s the Bank’s participation in 
a workshop on higher education reform and World Class Universities (March 2009 ) . I n the 
health sector, the Bank supported the MOH during 2005 /06 in preparing a “business plan” to 
map out a strategy for improving the efficiency and effectiveness o f public expenditures on 
health care, enhancing the quality o f health services, and increasing the regulatory, planning 
and policy-making capacity o f the MOH. I n addition, the National Health Insurance Fund 
(NFZ) was assisted i n conducting a needs assessment to strengthen the health management 
information system and build analytical capacity. The Government also actively participated 

19 

in Bank-organized workshops on private-public collaboration in health (Slovenia, December 
2006) and on pharmaceutical governance (Hungary, February 2007). 

42. 
Looking ahead, the Government i s interested in continued Bank support for 
social sector reforms, including employment promotion and pensions, social assistance, 
education, and health .care. This support would be provided through the ongoing policy 
lending program - DPL2 has a strong focus on social sectors aimed at f i s c a l consolidation, 
protecting priority programs and mitigating the social cost o f the c r i s i s - and AAA, both 
ESW (including the ongoing PER, which underpins the DPL) and technical cooperation. I n 
labor markets and social pro tec t ion , the Government may be interested in technical 
cooperation w i th the Bank on: (a) 
improving functions and coordination between 
employment and social welfare offices; (b) improving the targeting and cost-effectiveness o f 
active labor market programs; (c) designing modern activation policies; (d) strengthening the 
capacity o f the M in is t ry o f Labor to monitor and evaluate the net impact o f labor market 
programs; (e) modeling and policy assistance for the agricultural pension system; (f) review 
o f social assistance legislation and implementation; and (g) review and sharing o f 
international best-practice in integration o f various types o f social benefits and information- 
sharing across benefit types. During the c r is is , priority would be given to supporting active 
labor market programs and strengthening the system o f unemployment insurance. I n 
designing Bank assistance in these areas, equal gender opportunity policies would be taken 
into account and mainstreamed into the planned operations. In education, the ongoing 
program o f technical cooperation would be continued w i th the aim o f improving Poland’s 
student assessment systems and outcomes, as we l l as creating world-class universities and 
centers o f innovation that enhance Poland’s competitiveness. A similar program would be 
developed in health, focusing on long-term care, health insurance competition and associated 
regulatory agencies and supervisory bodies as we l l as the different types o f non-public 
insurers and 
risk-equalization mechanisms, hospital 
reform 
(including PPPs and 
corporatization, hospital debt management, and approaches to increase financial and 
management autonomy). 

Regional Development 

43. 
Since regional development and cohesion policies are the pillars around which 
the EU financial support i s provided, the effectiveness o f this policy framework and 
capacity o f Polish institutions involved in this process are key pre-conditions for 
successful implementation o f regional development programs in Poland. The M in is t ry o f 
Regional Development i s currently in the process o f updating the National Development 
Strategy for 2007-15. The new strategy w i l l provide a legal framework for the government 
policy towards regions w i th a focus on the mechanism o f cooperation and coordination 
between sub-national en t i t ies . W i th this in mind, the three main goals for the regional policy 
o f the Government are: increased competitiveness o f regions, use o f their internal capacity, 
and provision o f equal opportunities. Several international and bilateral partners support the 
M in is t ry to achieve these objectives. 

44. 
The Bank has supported the regional development agenda through various 
analytical and advisory activities and indirectly through some o f its projects. The 
analytical work on regional development i n Poland includes “Po land - D irec t ions in 
Regional Po l icy ” (2004 and 2006 Update) and to some degree the L i v ing Standards 
Assessment (2004) which also looked at regional disparities. Also, in February 2009, the 
Bank co-hosted a seminar on the lessons for Poland from the 2009 World Development 
Report (WDR) on economic geography. Further, some o f the objectives o f the Rural 
Development Project (closed 2005) as we l l as the on-going Post-Accession Rural Support 

20 

Project such as increasing social inclusion in underdeveloped municipalities and enhancing 
the institutional capacity o f local government have an indirect regional development focus. 

45. 
The Bank can continue to add value to the Polish authorities in their current 
medium-term strategic assessment o f regional development objectives and programs 
for 2009-13 and beyond. Based on the Bank’s global perspective as reflected in the 2009 
WDR and i t s knowledge o f the specific conditions i n Poland, further analytical and advisory 
support could be provided through focused studies on particular issues, seminars or 
workshops, and technical assistance in the following areas: (i) analysis o f challenges to 
economic integration across regions and with neighboring countries using the WDR 
framework; (ii) assessing patterns o f economic density, economic distance and divisions and 
implications for range a o f policies going beyond existing regional development program 
approaches (e.g., by addressing issues o f labor qualifications, land market distortions, 
business climate-Le., 
spatially blind institutions); (iii) fostering and/or reinforcing 
opportunities fo r inter- and intra-regional market linkages through urban agglomerations, in 
part by means o f spatially connective infrastructure; (iv) maximizing the allocative efficiency 
and effectiveness o f different components implemented within Regional Operational 
Programs, including the support to lagging regions; (v) introducing methodology for results- 
focused monitoring and evaluation o f EU and Government supported priorities related to 
regional, spatial, and territorial development. I t i s envisaged that future Bank services in this 
area would largely be provided on a fee-for-service basis. There may also be interest in sub- 
national lending to support lagging regions/municipalities or emerging growth poles (see 
transport infrastructure section below). 

Pillar 2: Public Sector Reform 

46. 

The public sector reform agenda remains one o f the most challenging in Poland. 
I n the area ofpublicfinance management, the top priority o f the Government’s medium-term 
strategy i s to meet the conditions necessary for euro adoption in a sustainable manner. 
Therefore, the most important challenge for f isca l policy in the medium-term i s to sustain 
f isca l consolidation and continue to enhance the “quality” o f public finances. The latter 
would not only contribute to meeting the obligations under the Stability and Growth Pact but 
also to better fulfilling citizens’ demands for improved quality o f public service while 
promoting growth and competitiveness. Improving public service delivery for citizens and 
businesses a l ike also requires strengthening o f public administration and governance.“ This 
includes improved policy coordination, further reforms i n the c iv i l service and judicial 
system, and good governance across the entire public sector.’* 

47. 
The Bank has been actively engaged over the years in helping Poland improve its 
public sector and this i s widely seen as a key area where the Bank can continue to add 
important value. I n the area of public finance management, the Bank has done extensive 
AAA, both in the form o f regional and national ESW and targeted Technical Assistance, and 
most recently also provided support through the on-going policy lending program (Public 
Finance Management, Employment, and Private Sector Development Programmatic Policy 

I ’ See for example the Bank’s recent study on Public Administration Reform i n the NMS: “Administrative 
Capacity in the New Member States: The L im i ts o f Innovation?” World Bank (2006). 

I 2 

The major areas vulnerable to corruption include construction and spatial planning, public procurement, and 
sub-national Government. 

21 

Loan).I3 I n the area ofpublic administration reform and governance, the dialogue was quite 
intense at the turn o f the decade but has since faded.I4 

4 8 . 

Looking ahead, Bank support would target (i) analysis and capacity building 
aimed at improving the quality o f public finances; (ii) strengthening public finance 
management practices and institutions, including performance-based budgeting, public 
investment planning, and the medium-term fiscal framework; and (iii) efforts to 
enhance public administration and governance. Bank support would not be restricted to 
the central government level but would increasingly involve also sub-national governments 
that are responsible for a large share o f public services delivery and recipients o f large 
amounts o f EU cohesion funds. Bank support would be provided through both the ongoing 
DPL program and AAA, including on a fee-for-service basis. 

49. 
Cooperation i s already under way and will be further developed in a number o f 
different areas at national and sub-national levels. A t the central government level, the 
Bank i s updating i t s PER, focusing on both legal and institutional reforms to further 
strengthen the quality o f public finances over the medium term and measures to address the 
more immediate challenges o f ensuring an adequate social safety net during the economic 
downturn within the tight f i s c a l constraints. This PER i s part o f the analytical underpinning 
for the on-going policy-based lending program. The Bank i s also continuing to support the 
development o f Performance-Based Budgeting and MTEF through technical cooperation. 
This could also include support for upgrading and integrating financial information systems. 
Further, the Ministry o f Justice may be interested in renewing cooperation on legal reform 
issues, including the functioning o f courts and case load management, while the Central 
Anti-corruption Bureau has expressed interested in learning about good practices i n 
corruption prevention and education. There may also be interest in Bank support for the 
Government's update o f i t s Anti-Corruption Program and Strategy (beyond 2009 ) . At the 
sub-national leve l , a program o f cooperation i s under way with the Mazowieckie region, 
including an innovative sub-national Public Expenditure Review to improve capital 
investment planning and debt management strategies and TA on a fee-for-service basis for 
management o f the transport infrastructure investment program. Similarly, cooperation with 
other subnational partners w i l l be pursued, using a broad range o f financing schemes, in 
various areas o f their responsibility such as: (i) public passenger transport; (ii) health, 
education and other social services; and (iii) public private partnerships. 

Pillar 3: Growth and Competitiveness 

50. 
There i s broad consensus that development o f infrastructure with emphasis on 
transport and improving the environment fo r private sector development are critical 
for high growth in Poland over the medium-long term. The road network, especially 
motorways, remains severely underdeveloped, with even main citiedgrowth centers not well 
connected. Railways and alternative modes o f transportation, including inland waterways, 

l3 The AAA includes the Public Expenditure a n d Ins t i tu t iona l Review (2003), 
the Coun try F i n a n c i a l 
Accoun tab i l i ty Assessment (2006), co-organization o f an In te rna t iona l Conference on Performance Based 
Budge t ing - Lessons fo r Po land (2007), and the ongoing program o f regional (EUIO) Regular Economic 
Reports (w i th several Special Topics on public finance issues) and f is ca l studies. 

l4 The World Bank issued its first report on corruption i n Poland i n 1999. The report generated broad interest 
from policy-makers, experts, business organizations, and c iv i l society. Subsequently, the Bank supported a 
number o f anti-corruption activities in the early 2000s, both at the country and regional levels. The Bank also 
co-financed research work o f non-Governmental organizations (NGOs), including on political parties financing 
and conflict o f interest, which lead to adoption o f anti-corruption regulations in these areas. 

22 

w i l l also need to play a much more prominent role, not only in meeting Poland’s transport 
needs but also in helping to address the significant climate change challenges related to the 
country’s dependence on coa l (the energy sector agenda i s discussed under Pillar 4 below). 
Investment needs substantially exceed what can be financed from EU structural and cohesion 
funds, and PPPs w i l l take time to phase in successfully. Although a small player, the Bank 
can play an important r o l e both in contributing to the financing o f these investments, 
including often neglected maintenance and rehabilitation, and i n supporting the development 
o f the institutional framework. Poland’s business environment remain hampered by excessive 
regulations and red tape as evidence in the country’s relatively poor Doing Business 
rankings, and the Bank i s uniquely suited to help address these challenges. 

Transpor t In f lus truc ture Development 

5 1. 
Underdeveloped transport infrastructure i s perceived as one of the major 
obstacles for further development o f Poland. Development o f transport infrastructure i s 
one o f the main priorities within the National Development Strategy with the majority o f EU 
grant funds earmarked to co-finance new land transport infrastructure (roads and ra i l) . The 
planned increase in the road construction program w i l l require strengthening the capacity o f 
the General Directorate for Public Roads and Motorways (GDDKiA), which needs to adopt a 
commercial administrative structure and to use modern asset and project management tools 
for planning, programming and project implementation. Similar challenges are faced by the 
railway sector which requires modernization and an improved regulatory regime aimed at 
improving competitiveness o f the sector. 

52 . While the EU and EU institutions, notably the E IB , are the main partners and 
external sources of financing fo r transport infrastructure development, the Bank can 
continue to play an 
important ro le in helping to build institutions and 
in 
complementary investments. With i t s extensive engagement in recent years in the roads 
sector, the Bank i s well placed to support the road agency GDDKiA to commercialize its 
management practices, particularly to improve the efficiency o f resource utilization. I n the 
rail subsector, Poland has taken steps to implement the separation o f rail operations from 
infrastructure management in accordance with EU requirements, and the Bank can support 
the reform process harnessing the vast experience from other EU member states, Further, the 
Bank can support investments, policy analysis and related reforms in areas such as: (i) 
maritime infrastructure and inland waterways; (ii) public transport financing as requested by 
the City o f Warsaw; (iii) management and financing o f transport i n the regions and 
municipalities; (iv) improving road sa fe ty ; and (v) increasing private sector participation in 
transport infrastructure. 

53 . 
Bank financing fo r the transport sector could support three broad categories o f 
activities to supplement programs financed by the Government, the EU and other 
International Financial Institutions (IFI): (i) ongoing rehabilitation programs for road and 
r a i l infrastructure that are not eligible for EU grants; (ii) improvement o f transport 
infrastructure to support the development o f poorer regions within Poland; and (iii) policy 
reforms and 
investment 
lending supporting the climate change agenda, 
including 
improvement o f public transport in urban areas or development o f maritime and inland 
waterways infrastructure. Financing from EU grants are focused on improving the 
infrastructure along the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) corridors with co- 
financing from EIB. Although financing for maintaining transport infrastructure i s not 
eligible for EU grants, this must remain a priority in order to protect the asset value in the 
existing road and rail networks. Poland also needs to invest in intra-regional connectivity, 
particularly to improve access to its poorer regions. The Bank could support the loca l 

23 

authorities to better prepare projects that are eligible fo r EU grant financing, and strengthen 
the capacity o f the regions to plan and implement projects. For large urban areas, Bank 
support could focus on financing public transport investments aimed at reducing carbon 
emissions, improving urban transport policy, regulatory frameworks, and tariff structures, 
and providing alternatives to motorized transport through green investments (e.g. pedestrian 
and cycle paths, inland waterways, etc.). 

54. 
Bank support to the transport sector can be provided through investment 
lending, policy lending or a range o f advisory services. Financing for the maintenance o f 
existing transport infrastructure could be through S WAp arrangements that would co-finance 
with the Government and other partners the multi-annual investment programs or 
subprograms. The third in a ser ies o f three such SWAps i s currently underway with the aim 
o f improving the quality, efficiency, financial viability and safety o f Poland’s roads. Large 
and complex individual projects or a group o f projects that are o f priority importance to the 
Government could be financed through traditional investment lending or through policy- 
based lending i f significant reforms are necessary beforehand (e.g. reform o f financing for 
public transport in large cities). The Bank’s advisory and analytical services could be 
deployed to support the analytical work preceding such reforms. This could include a 
strategic review o f transport sector investment priorities. The Ministry o f Infrastructure i s 
also interested in Bank support for analyzing the feasibility o f high-speed railways and 
implementing PPPs 
in transport (the 
la t te r also being important for subnational 
governments). In the absence o f new lending, much o f these advisory services would be 
expected to be provided on a cost sharing or fee-for-service basis. 

P r iva te Sector Deve lopment 

5 5 . 
Private sector development remains hampered by important constraints to the 
business e n ~ i r o nm e n t ’ ~ and an unfinished privatization agenda. Poland i s ranked around 
the middle in the global Doing Business indicators, significantly below several o f the other 
New Member States (NMS) and with little or no improvement in recent years. The main 
constraints relate to enforcing contracts, paying taxes, and obtaining permits fo r construction 
e tc . Further, the state remains in control o f “strategic” enterprises in energy and other 
network sectors and retains a large amount o f minority shareholdings in a range o f non- 
strategic companies. 

56. 
The Bank has played, and can continue to play, an important r o l e in supporting 
the environment f o r private sector development. The Government pays close attention to 
the annual Doing Business rankings, and has been working with the Bank’s experts on 
identifying in more detail the key shortcomings in the Polish business environment and 
analyzing reform plans and legislative proposals. I n this regard, the Bank may also help the 
Government look at the important gender dimensions to the business environment, in 
particular the inequalities i n terms o f women entrepreneurship and employment arising from 
barriers to entry o f new, small businesses. The Government i s also interested in working with 
the Bank on options for streamlining tax administration, including unification o f tax, social 

l5 According to new research conducted by the Polish-German Chamber o f Industry and Commerce (AHK) , 
Poland i s the most attractive location for foreign investment in the region. Eighty two percent o f respondents are 
content w i th the decision to locate their investment projects in Poland, w i th the opposite opinion expressed by 8 
percent o f the polled investors. I n the eyes o f foreign entrepreneurs and companies, Poland’s biggest assets 
include presence i n the EU, broad range o f local sub-suppliers, and the qualifications, commitment and 
productivity o f Polish employees. On the other hand, investors are most disappointed w i th the quality o f public 
infrastructure, the tax system and administration, and the regulatory burden on businesses. 

24 

security, and customs payments.’6 Further, the Bank has done a lot o f work on knowledge 
economy issues, including innovation, and more i s under way as part o f a broader regional 
study. I n addition to technical assistance and ESW, the Bank i s supporting the broader 
private sector development agenda, including privatization, through its programmatic DPL. 

57. 

Another initiative that i s aimed at improving the enabling environment for businesses 
in Poland i s the F inanc ia l Reporting Technical Assistance Pro jec t under the Swiss-Polish 
Cooperation Program. T h e program i s planned for 2009-2015 and funded with a CHF 10 
million Swiss grant. I t w i l l focus on improving the business environment and access to 
financing for SMEs through introduction o f international financial reporting and auditing 
standards for Polish companies. The Bank has been invited to help implement this project. 

58 . 

The Ministry o f Economy i s interested in broadening the cooperation with the 
Bank. I n particular, the Ministry has asked the Bank to look at on-going initiatives and 
lessonshest practices from other countries in: (i) PPP implementation (especially in non- 
transport sectors such as health and education); (ii) linear investments legislation (pipeline 
investments in energy, telecommunications, etc.); and (iii) streamlining the system o f state 
supervision and control over the activities undertaken by business entities. While some 
technical cooperation can be provided in the context o f the DPL program, i t i s expected that 
such services would largely be provided on a fee-for-service basis. 

Pillar 4: Global and Regional Public Goods 

Climate Change 

5 9 . 

Poland will face major challenges in meeting the EU climate change targets. A t 
the December 2008 EU Summit, EU members approved the “Energy and Climate Change 
Package” referred to as “20x3 by 2020”. While the package i s less stringent than the EC 
proposals from early 2008, i t w i l l s t i l l require substantial medium-long term adjustment in 
Poland towards low carbon growth, especially given its dependence on coal for energy 
production. Further, the EU targets are not accompanied by c lear strategies on how countries 
should reach the targets. 

60. 

The Bank has been actively engaged in Poland in various areas relating to the 
climate change agenda. I n recent years, the World Bank has been active in supporting the 
development o f Poland’s capacity to respond to natural disasters. The Odra River Basin 
Flood Protection Project (2007) supports investments in the Upper and Middle Odra River 
watershed to protect the population in the River Basin from loss o f l i f e and damage to 
property caused by severe and increased flooding. The Bank has also remained engaged in a 
few energy efficiency projects (wind farm, coke-to-gas, geothermal heating), particularly 
aiming to provide models that could be adopted by private financing. Further, it supported a 
Green Investment Scheme (GIS) Regional Forum in June 2008 in Warsaw, and during the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) Conference o f the 
Parties (COP14) held i n Poznan in December 2008, the Bank signed a Memorandum o f 
Understanding with the Polish Government for a GIS transaction o f 10 million Assigned 
Amount Units (AAUs). The Bank actively participated i n COP14 events, including a High 
L e v e l Event in Warsaw for Finance Ministers on “Low Carbon Growth”. Several discussion 
papers, a recent regional report on adaptation to climate change, and the forthcoming World 
Development Report 2010 pave the way for a substantive engagement on the analytical 
agenda. 

l6 There i s scope for collaboration w i th the IMF in this area. 

25 

61. 
The Bank can continue to supplement the activities driven by other partners 
(EU, EIB, O ECD and IMF) and add value to the climate change agenda in Poland. The 
EIB i s planning to expand its lending activity for energy-related projects. The IMF i s focused 
on analytical activities relating to the impact o f climate on the macro-economy, in particular 
f i s c a l developments. Finally, the OECD has prepared many regional and global reports 
related to climate change mitigation and adaptation. The Government i s interested in support 
for assessing the future costs and benefits o f various policy interventions leading to the 
abatement o f carbon emissions. Therefore, the Bank would focus primarily on energy as the 
main source o f C 0 2 emissions in Poland; but also on transport (options for “greening” 
through development o f railways and waterways, promotion o f bicycle paths in c i t i e s and 
towns. etc.) and environment. 

62 . 
Responding to the need fo r co re diagnostics, the Bank has started wo rk on an 
innovative Climate Change Country Economic Memorandum (CEM ) for Poland. The 
study would help develop a climate change strategy aimed at minimizing the costs and 
maximizing potential benefits according to various carbon mitigation scenarios. The study 
w i l l model the sector impact o f mitigation under different assumptions, estimate their 
macroeconomic implications, and illustrate an integrated, long-term, low-carbon growth 
strategy. The work would draw on the considerable and growing body o f knowledge from 
existing carbon studies in several other countries as well as the Clean Technology Fund plans 
underway in some o f these and other countries. The sector investigations w i l l discuss key 
sector policy initiatives, including sector-specific taxes and subsidies, regulatory changes, 
and R&D measures, as well as potential financing mechanisms for the identified investments 
and interventions. Further, there i s interest in Bank support to look at ways to enhance 
competition i n the energy sector, including competitive access to the grid. 

63 . 

Various operational interventions could be envisaged arising from this work. On 
climate change mitigation, potential Bank interventions could include energy efficiency 
projects, natural disaster mitigation (in particular against floods and also through the 
Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option (CAT DDO)), assisting with GIS transactions, 
supporting “clean carbon” technologies (including carbon capture and storage), and 
renewable energy investments. On adaptation to climate variability and change in the water 
sector related to natural disasters, potential World Bank interventions could include: (i) 
increasing flood/disaster preparedness through development o f a flooddisaster insurance 
pool; (ii) spatial planning in flood plains to support vulnerable local and regional 
governments in their risk assessment in local spatial plans; (iii) strengthening institutional 
capacity towards emergency preparedness, including improvement o f flood forecasting and 
management, 

Financial sector stability 

I n recent years, the Bank worked jointly with the IMF on FSAP reports - the last 
64. 
update was made in 2006. The objective o f the Financial Sector Assessment Program 
(FSAP) was 
to ass is t the Polish authorities in identifying strengths and potential 
vulnerabilities in the financial system that could have macroeconomic consequences, as well 
as challenges in the development o f the financial system. The report attempted to identify 
measures to improve the functioning, reduce the risks, and strengthen the operation and 
oversight o f the financial system in Poland. 

65 . 

Since Poland has one o f the most solid financial systems in Europe, there has 
been little reason for more active Bank intervention, but the environment has changed 

26 

dramatically following the outbreak o f the global financial c r is is . Given the significant 

uncertainty around the financial crisis and i t s repercussions, the Polish authorities may be 
interested in a renewed and broader Bank engagement in this area. Aside from technical 
cooperation, this could also involve lending aimed at supporting those segments in the 
economy which are most affected by the financial c r i s i s . For example, the credit line under 
preparation to support SMEs through PKO BP (as a wholesale bank) i s primarily a response 
to the c r i s i s and current short-term funding and risk aversion in the Polish financial system. 

D. Proposed Program 

66. 
The extent o f Wo r ld Bank engagement w i l l depend on client demand for 
borrowin and final resolution o f the procurement issue related to fee-for-service 

business." Client demand for borrowing i s likely to be significant given large investment 
needs and current adverse international financial market conditions. I n addition to the 
ongoing budget support related to the DPL program, several ministries and local 
governments have expressed interest in borrowing from the Bank and the Ministry o f 
Finance has expressed i t s willingness to consider additional, preferably quick-disbursing, 
operations as well as guarantees for non-sovereign borrowing. The Bank may also provide 
various types o f credit enhancement instruments. While the Bank has recently concluded a 
partial fee-for-service agreement and another i s pending, development o f this line o f business 
has been constrained by the lack o f clarity in the Polish procurement law regarding sole 
sourcing o f Bank advisory services.'* 

67. 
The planned lending program i s guided by the assumption that the global c r i s i s 
will not be protracted and by the Bank's notional lending resources available fo r 

Poland. Lending i s expected to be substantial in FY09-IO before declining in FY 11, with 
total exposure increasing to about USD seven billion. Lending would be focused on the DPL 
program and a limited number o f other operations supporting economic activity and the 
longer-term development agenda. This would be accompanied by a limited program o f AAA 
activities related to the DPL program and some additional strategic ESW. There would be a 
modest expansion o f the cost-sharing/fee-based service (FBS) business over the medium 
term. During the course o f this CPS, the Bank's business model in Poland i s assumed to 
gradually rely more and more on fee-based provision o f knowledge services which could be 
scaled up i f there i s client demand, including at the subnational government level. While FBS 
would by nature be more opportunistic, they would still be confined to the strategic areas o f 
engagement defined in the CPS. I f the c r i s is were to be deeper or more protracted, the Bank's 
ability to increase lending volumes would need to be revisited. 

68. 

The program in the first year will include continued implementation o f the 

current active portfolio. The portfolio has a total exposure o f about USD 2 billion and 
consists o f a recently disbursed single-tranche DPL and four investment operations: one in 
the roads sector (for maintenance and rehabilitation); one for flood protection on the Odra 
River; one for rural support; and a Global Environment Facility (GEF) energy efficiency 
project, as well as two Prototype Carbon Fund (renewable energy) operations. Disbursement 
rates slowed during the las t CPS period due to delays in establishing the necessary 
arrangements for new projects, protracted inter-agency communications and decision- 
making, but the FY09 disbursement ratio has picked up and i s almost 22 percent, which 

" The planned engagement i s based on existing Bank administrative resources for Poland. 

18 

Polish procurement law prohibits sole-sourcing for contracts below [value], while the Bank cannot engage in 
competitive bidding. An interpretation o f Polish procurement law issued by the Polish Procurement Office in 
May 2009 , following intensive discussions w i th Bank staff, should allow the Bank to undertake work for the 
Polish authorities when requested i n the future as f isca l pressures ease. 

27 

compares favorably with the overall Bank and Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region (19 
and 12 percent, respectively). Two o f the investment projects-road maintenance and rural 
support-are performing well with project objectives either largely met or implementation 
progressing steadily towards their achievement. The energy efficiency project very 
successfully implemented energy efficiency projects in more than 20 schools in Krakow, but 
the guarantee component has not taken o f f satisfactorily due to delays in finding the right 
counterpart bank and reduced risk appetite due to the f inanc ia l c r is is ; the Odra river project 
was significantly delayed by changes in Government counterpart and a lengthy contracting 
process during the first year o f implementation, but i s now picking ups. Both project teams 
are pro-actively engaged with counterparts to overcome the delays and bring implementation 
back on track. The delays through the last CPS period and the current turn-around in 
portfolio performance are closely correlated with the Government’s renewed interest in 
working with the World Bank. 

69. 
Overall financial management performance o f the current portfolio i s 
satisfactory and the residual financial management risk i s moderate. The portfolio 
includes large, complex and innovative projects using country system procedures or 
implemented in a highly decentralized environment. This results in a substantial level o f risk 
that i s mitigated by measures embedded in the design and supervision o f each operation. 
Only one active project (the Odra river project) i s not currently rated satisfactory on financial 
management, due only to delays. A remedial action plan i s under implementation and i s 
being closely monitored by the Bank. The project i s expected to be upgraded shortly. 

70. 
The program in the first year o f this CPS w i l l be anchored in the on-going DPL 
series, while supporting economic activity and the longer-term development agenda 
through innovative, non-sovereign loans. The DPL series provides an anchor for the 
program as i t cuts across most o f the strategic pillars o f engagement. The associated AAA 
work includes the ongoing PER focused on social sector reform, regional and Poland-specific 
work on public finance management reform (especially implementation o f MTEFs and 
Performance-Based Budgeting), and ESW/TA in education, health, and social protection. I n 
addition, two non-sovereign loans are planned to support economic activity and the longer 
term development agenda: a sub-national transport infrastructure investment loan with the 
City o f Warsaw and a financial intermediary loan with PKO to support SME development. 
The former would be accompanied by a number o f analytical studies, including on optimal 
long-term t a r i f f policy. There i s also an ongoing, innovative sub-national PER for the 
Mazowieckie region that w i l l be relevant for the City o f Warsaw loan. This i s part o f a 
broader, cost-sharing arrangement with the region that w i l l also support transport planning. 
Further, an innovative climate change CEM i s under preparation, and we plan a strategic 
transport policy review. Finally, the Ministries o f Infrastructure, Economy, and Regional 
Development are interested in working with the Bank on a fee-for-service basis on various 
issues in line with the CPS pillars. 

71. 
Beyond the first year, the program i s less well-defined at present. However, 
depending upon client demand, non-lending services could potentially be scaled up, 
primarily on a fee-for-service basis. Lending would focus on transport infrastructure, 
climate change mitigation and adaptation, and sub-national development. The Ministry o f 
Infrastructure i s keen to enhance i t s cooperation with the Bank and the climate change CEM 
could lead to new lending opportunities. I f the City o f Warsaw project i s successful, i t i s 
expected that this could be replicated i n other major cities or l e s s advantaged regions in 
Poland. However, the lending program beyond FY 10 should be considered tentative and 
subject to the Bank’s financial capacity to support it. There i s also strong demand for further 
AAA work that complements the social sector aspects o f the DPL agenda and ongoing PER, 

28 

as well as i n other areas o f Bank comparative advantage. I f client demand for lending fa l ls , 
the program could shift downwards towards a program o f niche, fee-based services to 
complement the Government’s own program and that o f other external partners.

E. Poverty and Social Impact 
72. 
The CPS supports sustainable poverty reduction in a number o f ways. First, the 
proposed program ass is ts Poland to address the rapid deterioration o f the economic 
environment which, through a slowdown i n growth and r i s e in unemployment, i s lowering 
living standards across a l l income quintiles. By ensuring a recovery o f growth over the 
medium term, government reforms supported by the CPS create the space for raising living 
standards among poor households. Second, the CPS supports measures that can be expected 
to enhance Poland’s investment climate and competitiveness while improving Poland’s 
capacity to respond to climate change. This in turn would f a c i l i t a t e employment creation, 
economic growth and poverty reduction over time. Third, the CPS supports structural 
reforms in the areas o f education, health, pensions, infrastructure, and labor markets to 
ensure equitable delivery o f basic public service. Fourth, the CPS supports mitigation 
measures to shield poor people from major adverse impacts o f the economic cr is is . 

73. 
As part o f the analytical underpinnings o f the DPL series, the Bank i s drawing on the 
2007 Poland Household Budget survey to update the profile o f poverty and vulnerability and 
provide an incidence analysis o f public expenditures in the social sectors. This w i l l form the 
basis for an assessment of the social and poverty impact o f the economic c r is is , and o f 
the effectiveness of government programs to mitigate the impact o f the cr is is on poor 

’’ F o r fu r the r de ta i ls , please see Annexes B3 and B4 

29 

households. This analysis w i l l be updated with the help o f the 2008 Household Budget 
Survey which i s expected to become available in September 2009 . 

F. Results framework 

74. 

The envisaged Bank engagement i s expected to support the achievement o f key 
Government objectives. I n addition to the general day-to-day policy dialogue, the envisaged 
lending and AAA program should be supportive o f key Government objectives i n various 
policy areas. The results framework largely reflects the results anticipated from the existing 
portfolio and those operations planned for the first year o f the CPS (see Annex A l ) . 
However, the Bank program would be small in the context o f Poland’s overall development 
program and spending and cannot be expected to have an independent and measurable 
contribution to broader outcomes. Nevertheless, the envisaged partnership and selected 
interventions within broader policy areas i s seen as preferable to a potentially more narrowly 
focused and substantive engagement where outcomes perhaps could be more closely related 
to the Bank’s activities. 

Economic 

v. RISKS 

75. 
The medium-term macroeconomic scenario o f slowing economic growth and 
moderating inflation i s subject to further downside risks. While inflationary pressures 
have abated significantly with the recent global slowdown and tighter credit conditions as 
well as moderation o f wage pressure, the recent depreciation o f the zloty could rekindle 
inflationary pressures. Poland has one o f the most solid financial systems in Europe, but the 
interbank market remains constrained due to lack o f confidence. The authorities may need to 
respond with additional confidence-restoring and liquidity-enhancing measures. I n the 
context o f the euro adoption agenda which requires f i s c a l discipline, the supply side o f the 
economy needs to be hrther stimulated through acceleration o f structural reforms. 

76. 

Poland’s external and financial vulnerability may be further affected by global 
and regional developments. Recent developments demonstrate the existing risk o f 
contagion from other countries i n the region, and access to external financing sources may 
become more difficult and more expensive. Entering the ERh42 during significant volatility 
on global f inanc ia l markets poses risks for exchange ra te stability over a minimum two-year 
period as required by the relevant Maastricht criterion. A t the same time, there i s risk o f a 
misaligned EURPLN central parity in ERh42 and during the ultimate conversion rate from 
zloty into euro. On the other hand, the Government’s firm euro adoption plan and lends 
credibility to f isca l policy and may help preserve confidence in a very difficult external 
environment, 

77. 
I f these economic risks materialize and the c r is is i s longer o r deeper than 
currently anticipated, there could be calls fo r the IFIs (including the Bank) to increase 
their funding. The Bank could do this either by augmenting the DPL ser ies and/or with 
investment loans. This i s likely to be possible financially, given the small s ize o f Poland’s 
outstanding debt to IBRD, but would stretch existing staff and resources. 

Po l i t ica l 

78. 
The projected deterioration o f economic prospects may undermine social 
support to the Government and reduce its willingness to push fo r more radical reforms. 

30 

Reform momentum i s already constrained by the risk o f Presidential veto on new proposed 
legislation, i n particular in the area o f social services. I n this context, there i s a risk o f general 
elections earlier than scheduled for f a l l 20 1 1. This may be provoked, for example, by internal 
tensions in the governing PO and in the coalition i f Prime Minister Tusk decides to run for 
President in 2010. The Government’s lack o f constitutional majority in Parliament and 
elusive compromise with the opposition Pis, which demands a referendum on euro adoption, 
could complicate the euro adoption plan and aggravates risks related to the ERM2 transition 
period. 

7 9 . 
Public and political support fo r a significant reform agenda i s often difficult. The 
Government has been making strong communication efforts to explain the need for reform 
and the global c r i s i s has only heightened awareness o f the need for reforms to remain 
competitive. I f public and political pressures weaken the reform agenda, the DPL program 
may need to be scaled back. The Bank could continue with AAA and a lighter financing 
program. 

Ins t i tu t iona l 

80. 
Policy formulation and coordination in Poland has tended to be fragmented and 
technical and administrative capacity in some ministries remains weak. Aside from the 
forthcoming election years, elements o f the heavy bureaucracy may also be opposing change. 
Absorption o f the very large EU structural and cohesion funds and the organization o f the 
UEFA Soccer Championship i n 2012 w i l l require additional capacity and efforts from public 
administration. I n the absence o f this, public investment would be unable to compensate for 
the projected slowdown in private investment, and weaker absorption o f EU funds could also 
have political repercussions. 

81. 
This i s an on-going risk that i s difficult to mitigate. However, capacity-building i s 
very much part o f the Bank’s agenda and weaknesses are likely to delay, rather than derail, 
the Bank’s program. 

82. 
A l l the risks above are considered to be low-to-moderate in likelihood and 
impact. 

V I . CONSULTATIONS W ITH GOVERNMENT AND OTHER PARTNERS 

83. 
The CPS design and implementation i s informed by broad consultations. I n 
addition to the ongoing dialogue with the Government, including on priorities for further 
cooperation, the Bank circulated the draft CPS to key government ministries for comments 
following the ROC meeting. Subsequently, consultations-based 
on a power-point 
presentation-were 
also held with Parliament representatives and other stakeholders, 
including c iv i l society (the latter jointly with the Ministry o f Finance). Further, web-based 
consultations were conducted. I n parallel with the Bank-wide review, the draft CPS was also 
shared with the IMF and the EC for comments. Following Board discussion, the final 
multimedia CPS package would be posted on the web site. The final and endorsed CPS 
would be also presented in a press briefing organized jointly with the Ministry o f Finance, 
and an op-ed would be prepared in one o f the leading Polish dailies. Time permitting, the 
CPS would also be presented and discussed in the major Polish cities (Warsaw, Gdansk, 
Krakow, Poznan, Lodz) as part o f the Bank’s regional outreach effort.

CPS COM P L E T ION REPORT 

I. Background 

1. 
The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) f o r Poland was designed to align the 
Bank’s program both w i t h Poland’s development challenges and priorities as a new EU 
member. The CPS provided a broad and flexible framework for the Wo r ld Bank to support 
Poland in a selective manner in an environment where the need for external borrowing was 
modest. The strategy took as i t s starting point Poland’s development priorities, including: i) 
high and sustained economic growth w i th the objective o f reaching two-thirds o f the E U 
average per capita income by 2013, ii) improved competitiveness o f f i r m s and regions, iii) 
recovery o f employment, and (iv) strong social cohesion. These priorities and overall strategy 
were contained in Poland’s National Development Plan (NDP) 2004-06 and National 
Development Strategy (NDS) 2007-1 3.

The CPS set out a flexible framework to help the Government meet its objectives. 
Ke y elements o f the CPS framework were: 
Strategic and demand driven work program consistent w i th the Government’s 
priorities: 
Fiscal consolidation 
0 Convergence/competitiveness 
0 Employment and poverty reduction 
Clear guidelines for engaging the Bank: 
Demonstrated demand from Poland for Bank services 
Significant po l icy or structural issues involved 
Bank value added in terms o f techn ica l excellence and comparative advantage 
0 Effective partnerships 
Rapid response and simplification o f procedures 
A single lending case based on a conducive macroeconomic framework 
Open-ended duration o f the CPS predicated on continued demand for Bank 
services and existence o f a conducive macroeconomic environment consistent 
w i th Poland’s convergence program under the EU’s Stability and Growth Pact.

11. Poland’s Strategic Goals 

3. 
At the time of the CPS, the Government’s overriding goal was fo r Poland to move 
towards convergence with the rest of the EU by reaching two-thirds o f the EU’s per 
capita average income by 2013. The CPS was launched at the time that Poland had 
achieved i t s overriding goal o f E U membership on May 1, 2004. The Government’s post- 
accession development strategy was contained in i t s NDP 2004-2006, and in the NDS 2007- 
20 13 . The overriding objective o f the strategy was to put the economy on a path o f high and 
sustainable growth through improved competitiveness o f f i r m s and regions, to contribute to 
the recovery o f employment, and promote strong social cohesion. The strategy laid out three 
challenges to be met: 

0 Convergence to European income levels: To achieve the stated aim o f reaching 
two-thirds o f per capita EU average income by 20 13, the Government recognized that 
medium t e r m convergence to European income levels would require sustained high 
growth averaging 4.5 percent based on strong competitiveness in European and wo r ld 

49 

Annex C 

markets. This would entail continued structural reforms to: (a) improve the business 
environment, including broadening and deepening financial intermediation, initiating 
judicial system reform and deepening public administration reform, including being 
able to use the available resources from the EU effectively and efficiently; (b) 
improve the energy and transport infrastructure: and (c) develop the knowledge 
economy, including initiating tertiary education reform. 

0 Fiscal consolidation and meeting the requirements fo r euro adoption: The 
Government's medium-term macroeconomic plans were centered on meeting the 
conditions for euro adoption in 2009 . Poland's convergence program in 2004 
envisaged a reduction o f the general Government deficit below 3 percent o f GDP by 
2007, while maintaining public debt below 60 percent o f GDP i n line with i t s EU 
convergence program in the context o f the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP).20 I n 
addition, ambitious reforms were foreseen for sectors that had been a burden to the 
budget such as coal mining, railways and health, as well as reforms o f social transfers 
aimed at increasing labor market incentives (notably the farmers' pension system and 
disability pensions). Public expenditure management systems and tax administration 
also required further improvement. 

0 

Increasing employment and reducing poverty: I n Poland, there i s a strong 
correlation between family income levels and employment status o f heads o f 
household. Employment creation remained sluggish at the start o f the CPS period, 
and was indeed lower than i t had been i n the past when i t had offset the considerable 
job destruction associated with economic transition. As a result, unemployment was 
high and long-term unemployment was increasing, leading to growing pockets o f 
long-term poverty and social exclusion. To stimulate new job creation, labor market 
reforms were needed and small and medium enterprise (SME) development needed to 
be revitalized. Large inequalities in education and skills were a key barrier to citizens' 
capacity to find and hold a job and, thus, to staying out o f poverty. There was also a 
need to examine the system o f social transfers for better targeting, as evidence 
suggested that in some circumstances social transfers had created a disincentive to 
more active participation in the labor market. Growing pockets o f long-term 
unemployment and poverty also had to be dealt with, requiring actions to increase the 
level o f social inclusion. 

111. Poland's Progress towards its Strategic Goals 

4. 
Poland has successfully managed its integration into the European Union (EU). 
Macroeconomic performance through most o f the CPS period has been favorable, with 
strong output growth and a rapid decline in unemployment combined with low inflation and 
external imbalances. Meanwhile, buoyant tax revenues have led to a decline in the f i s c a l 
deficit. Growth has been built on a vibrant private sector which now accounts for three- 
quarters o f the economy. High growth in domestic consumption reflects the rapid increase in 
living standards for most Polish citizens. Likewise, poverty levels have decreased 
considerably over recent years. Poland has weathered the f inanc ia l c r i s i s that hit the region in 
2008 relatively well, but i s not immune from the e f fec ts o f the global economic downturn, 
which could reverse some o f the gains. 

The main objective o f the SGP i s to enforce discipline in the Euro zone as a means to support price stability 
and sustainable growth. 

50 

5. 
While Poland’s reform momentum slowed down following EU accession, i t has 
nonetheless met o r exceeded most o f its strategic goals set out in the CPS: 

Annex C 

0 Growth and income convergence with the EU accelerated over the CPS period, 
but growth has suffered a setback due to the global economic c r i s i s and 
sustaining strong growth w i l l require renewed reforms: Economic growth 
averaged 5 .5 percent in 2004-2007, but w i l l dip sharply in 2009 due to the global 
c r i s i s . As a result, Poland’s GDP per capita at purchasing power parity reached 55 .5 
percent o f the average for the EU-27 in 2008. The strong growth from 2004-07 
r e f l e c t s to a significant extent a rebound from the economic slowdown in the earlier 
part o f the decade combined w i th a favorable external environment until the recen t 
global f inanc ia l c r i s i s hit. A continued rapid reduction o f the income gap w i th the EU 
would require sustained high growth based on strong productivity increases and 
higher employment and investment rates. This in turn would require a renewed focus 
on reform which had slowed down in recen t years: (i) public finance reforms to 
improve the quality and e f f i c ien c y o f public finances, (ii) structural reforms to 
improve the general investment climate and support restructuring o f low-productivity 
sectors, and (iii) labor supply mobilization to further raise low employment rates, and 
improve s k i l l s o f the workforce. 

e Robust growth was accompanied by broadly sound macroeconomic 
fundamentals. In line w i th global tendencies, from late 2007 inflation accelerated 
above the inflation target ( o f 2.5 +/-1 percent), driven largely b y cost factors (higher 
food and energy prices) but also rising unit labor costs resulting from the sharp labor 
market tightening. I n response, interest rates were hiked gradually from spring 2007, 
while accompanying zloty appreciation made monetary conditions even more 
restrictive. Although the external current account deficit widened further to 5.5 
percent o f GDP in 2008, i t remained moderate by historical and regional standards 
and was almost fu l ly financed by net foreign direct investment (FDI). Nonetheless, 
the foreign-debt-to-GDP ratio increased to around 57 percent o f GDP in 2008, partly 
because o f the significant zloty depreciation in late 2008. 

0 The fiscal stance improved significantly from 2005 to 2007, which helped Poland 
move c loser towards Euro adoption by 2012. The general government deficit, 
including the costs o f pension reform (around 2 percent o f GDP per annum), 
amounted to 2 percent o f GDP i n 2007 compared to 3.8 percent o f GDP in 2006 and 
4.3 percent o f GDP in 2005. This impressive outcome was achieved due to strong 
revenues and tight spending control, but this achievement may be at risk given the 
sharp slowing o f demand for Polish exports in Western Europe. Due to strong 
nominal GDP growth, zloty appreciation, and a primary f i s c a l surplus o f around 0.5 
percent o f GDP, the public debt-to-GDP ratio declined from over 47 percent o f GDP 
in 2005-2006 to 45 percent o f GDP in 2007. A t the end o f 2007, Poland met the 
reference values for deficit and debt and fu l f i l led the inflation and interest rate criteria 
o f the Maastricht Treaty. In June 2008 the EC recommended closing Poland’s 
Excessive D e f i c i t Procedure (imposed in 2004) on the basis o f Poland’s updated 
Convergence Program and confirmed that the deficit was reduced below the reference 
value o f 3 percent o f GDP i n a credible and sustainable manner. I n la te 2008, the 
Government announced a roadmap to euro adoption in 2012, which implied jo in ing 
the ERM -2 around the middle o f 2009. However, the economic c r i s i s pushed Poland 
towards a larger fiscal deficit than envisaged. According to the Spring 2009 Fiscal 
Notification to Eurostat, the f i s c a l deficit in 2008 reached 3.9 percent o f GDP and i s 
51 

Annex C 

projected to increase further to 4.6 percent o f GDP in 2009. Because o f a deficit 
higher than the Maastricht threshold o f 3 percent o f GDP, in M a y 2009 the European 
Commission issued a report initiating the re-opening o f the Excessive De f ic i t 
Procedure. In addition, due to excessive exchange ra te vo la t i l i ty and lack o f political 
consensus to amend the Constitution, the plans for E M - 2 entry in the first h a l f o f 
2009 were abandoned, which may delay euro adoption. 

0 Employment conditions improved considerably. Strong growth created new jobs 
during 2004-07. As a result o f rising labor demand, and to a lesse r degree external 
migration, the unemployment ra te f e l l from about 20 percent in 2003 to 7 percent in 
2008. In tandem, the incidence o f long-term unemployment has recently declined 
significantly. The growth i n employment was accompanied by strong growth in real 
wages, which averaged 3 percent per year over the las t 5 years, accelerating i n the las t 
two years and outpacing productivity gains. But despite the considerable progress i n 
reducing unemployment, the employment/population ratio remains one o f the lowest 
i n the E U (57 percent against the E U average o f about 65 percent) and we l l below the 
Lisbon target o f 70 percent primarily due to the low labor force participation o f older 
workers (ages 5 5 to 64). Anecdotal evidence suggests that some migration flows to 
Western Europe are now declining or reversing. 

0 The improvement in labor market conditions had a positive effect on poverty. As 
a result, the o f f ic ia l poverty rate dropped by almost 5 percentage points in just three 
years: from the peak o f 19.2 percent in 2004 to 14.6 percent i n 2007, w i th the trend 
continuing i n 2008, although these gains may be at risk w i th a temporary r i s e in 
poverty anticipated in 2009 in particular among those in export industries as a result 
o f the global economic c r i s i s . Poland's tax and benefit system have also played a 
strong redistributive role, thereby helping reduce income inequality considerably (the 
G in i coefficient i s 0.329 - comparable w i th that o f UK, Estonia or Greece). Poverty i s 
concentrated in rural areas and among the long-term unemployed.

IV . CPS Objectives 

6. 

The CPS set out a flexible framework to help the Government meet its objectives. 
I n view o f Poland’s middle income status, the CPS did not set out a pre-determined program 
o f Bank activities but rather a flexible partnership arrangement in which Bank activities in 
Poland would be strategic and demand driven focusing on areas which were considered 
consistent with Poland’s development priorities as laid out in i t s National Development Plan, 
and where (i) significant policy or structural issues were involved; (ii) the Bank could add 
value in terms o f its technical excellence and comparative advantage; and (iii) effective 
partnerships could be maintained with internal and external partners, including EU, EIB, 
EBRD and CEDB. The Bank would support Poland with a full set o f lending and non- 
lending instruments with Bank activities determined on an annual basis and consistent with 
the Polish planning and budgeting cycle. Flexibility o f the CPS framework would permit 
rapid response to emerging demand, with the intent to simplify project designs, shorten 
preparation times, and simplify and align World Bank procedures with Polish and EU 
practices in line with the World Bank’s initiative on the use o f country systems. The CPS 
framework was designed to remain in force as long as Bank services were in demand and the 
macroeconomic environment was consistent with Poland’s convergence program under the 
EU’s Stability and Growth Pact. 

7. 

The CPS was to support three broad strategic priorities (the three CPS pillars) 
laid out in Poland’s National Development Plan: 

Fiscal Consolidation: Promote f isca l adjustment and reverse negative debt dynamics 
through restructuring o f public expenditures; 
Convergence/Competitiveness: Promote convergence with the EU through an 
improved investment climate and enhanced competitiveness; and 
e Employment and Poverty: Reduce poverty, encourage social inclusion, and bring 
employment closer to the Lisbon targets. 

8. 

Overall, the priorities and framework fo r engagement laid out in the CPS have 
been appropriate. The strategic priorities supported by the CPS have continued to be 
relevant as demonstrated by the reform areas which continue to be important for securing 
Poland’s future high growth. The flexible engagement framework o f the CPS was also 
appropriate and consistent with the Bank’s new approach i n such well-performing middle 
income countries (MICs). The following sections on CPS outcomes and results (section V 
below) and Bank performance (section V I below) w i l l ascertain whether CPS 
implementation followed these principles o f engagement. 

V. CPS Outcomes /Results 

Ma jo r factors affecting CPS implementation and outcomes 

9 . 
Poland’s recurring political changes and related policy changes had a significant, 
adverse impact on CPS implementation. The CPS period saw three different governments 
with diverse interests in economic policy. Each o f the governments was based on coalitions 
with narrow parliamentary majorities, which in one case led to early elections. Within 6 
months o f the CPS launch a significant political shift took place following general elections, 
with a coalition led by conservative Law and Justice (Pis) party taking over from the 
coalition led by the left-leaning Democratic Left Alliance (SDL). The PiS-led coalition 
collapsed in the summer o f 2007 which led to early elections and the emergence o f another 

5 3 

Annex C 

coalition led by the Civic Platform (PO) party and Prime Minister Donald Tusk. A l l these 
political changes made for a challenging turbulent political background and lack o f 
continuity for CPS implementation. 

10. Frequent changes in Government also led to rapid turnover o f key counterparts 
which further affected continuity and ownership o f Bank activities. Besides frequent 
policy reversals, there was a frequent turnover o f counterparts - ministers, undersecretaries 
and even non-political staff. On various occasions, activities were started based on 
understandings reached with one set o f counterparts which had to be suspended after 
preparation had advanced as a new se t o f interlocutors had moved in. This turned out to be a 
problem in many o f the AAA activities undertaken. 

11. 
I n addition, reform implementation slowed down as a result o f reform fatigue 
following Poland’s recent EU accession. As noted, Poland has seen robust economic 
performance in recent years. This was, in part, due to a natural catch-up after Poland’s slow 
growth earlier in the decade, the positive effects o f its recent EU membership, and a buoyant 
external environment. Nonetheless, Poland still has a considerable reform agenda in 
completing privatization, improving the business environment, enhancing the quality and 
efficiency o f public finances, developing infrastructure, and addressing emerging bottlenecks 
in the labor market. The current Government has restarted reforms in a number o f these 
areas, which has opened the way for renewed Bank engagement in the form o f a 
programmatic policy loan (DPL) in support o f public finance management, employment and 
private sector development (FY09). 

12. Finally, EU accession also brought access to new financing sources, including 
sizeable EU grants, and market finance. These likely contributed to decline in interest in 
IBRD loans. Interest in Bank loans re-surfaced with the recognition o f the significant 
analytical support associated with IBRD projects. 

CPS Outcomes 

13. There has been progress in achieving the outcomes foreseen under each o f the 
CPS Pillars. These outcomes have been assessed against the intermediate indicators included 
in the CPS Results Matrix under each o f three CPS Pillars (Fiscal Consolidation, 
ConvergenceKompetitiveness, and Employment and Poverty). 

Pillar 1: Fiscal Consolidation 

(a) Consolidate public finances for entry into E N - 2 

14. There i s broad consensus on the need to reform public finances in order for 
Poland to enter the ERM - 2 and subsequently adopt the Euro. The Government has 
announced i t s intention to join ERM-2 in 2009 and prepare for euro adoption in 2012. Un t i l 
2009, Poland had made sustained progress towards meeting the requirements to enter the 
ERM-2: the budget deficit was reduced from 5.7 percent o f GDP in 2004 to 3.9 percent o f 
GDP in 2008 and public debt increased slightly from around 46 percent o f GDP in 2004 to 
o f GDP. The Bank’s AAA work in this area (the EU8 Fiscal Policy work in 2005 - 2008 and 
47 percent o f GDP in 2008, safely below the, Maastricht Treaty reference value o f 60 percent 
the Regional Economic Reports) has contributed both to the analytic underpinning o f these 
issues and to broader public understanding and debate. However, the effects o f the financial 

54 

Annex C 

c r i s i s and economic downturn in Europe, and automatic stabilizes operating outside o f the 
state budget, pushed the f isca l deficit above the 3 percent o f GDP threshold in 2008. 

(b) 
E l im inate state support for reform of selected sectors and ensure their 
sustainability 

15. There has been substantial progress in eliminating the need f o r future state 
support to reform selected sectors and ensure their financial sustainability. Specifically, 
the hard coa l mining companies have been operating within a hard budget constraint, have 
met a l l of their obligations, including taxes and social benefits, have been profitable in 2005 
and 2006, and a l l further restructuring costs are to be paid by the coal companies and not by 
the state budget. The restructuring o f the railway sector, while incomplete, has also made i t 
possible to progress toward a sustainable level o f budget support for socially necessary 
services, primarily as a result o f devolving the responsibility for regional passenger services 
to regional governments and capping subsidies at their 2005 levels. I n the health sector, the 
Act on Health Care Services Financed from Public Funds (2004) i s being implemented. 
Work i s ongoing to redefine a basic benefit package to be delivered within the existing health 
insurance resources. 

16. The H a rd Coal Restructuring Program 2004-06 (2004-06 Program) was largely 
implemented with the support o f t w o Bank loans. While progress was significant, the 
specific targets were not fully met i n terms o f reduction o f employment (from 136,500 to 
119,000 instead o f the target o f 117,000) and capacity (from 102.6 million tons per year (tpy) 
to 97 million tpy instead o f 94.8 tpy), mainly as a result o f the buoyant coal market, which 
allowed companies to be profitable and meet a l l obligations, including taxes and soc ia l 
benefits without budget support. The planned privatization was delayed due to the lack of 
consensus with social partners but important preparatory steps were taken. While much has 
been achieved, the largest company, Kompania Weglowa (KW) remains financially 
vulnerable to declines in coal prices and made losses in the fourth quarter o f 2006 due to 
falling export prices. The Bank’s AAA work for the Hard Coal Sector has provided inputs 
into the Government’s Action Plan for the sector for 2007-15. I t addresses areas not fully 
completed under the 2004-06 Program. I t assumes that long-term viability o f the sector w i l l 
be sustained by mining companies taking actions to: (i) control costs to keep production costs 
below the coal price; (ii) adjust the production capacity o f coal to domestic market needs and 
economically justified export markets; ( i i i) sustain financial liquidity and secure credit 
worthiness o f the companies; and (iv) identify new uses for coa l and new markets for coal. 
I n addition, the plan ca l ls for limited privatization o f coal mining companies through public 
listing on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. Such privatization would help strengthen the 
governance o f the mining companies and provide access to new sources o f capital. 
Privatized coa l companies would enhance energy security for Poland just as they do for other 
major producers such as Australia, South Africa, Canada and the United States. 

17. 
I n the health sector, the Bank supported the Ministry of Health to implement the 
Act on Health Care Services Financed from Public Funds (2004), and more broadly, to 
improve the efficiency and effectiveness o f public expenditures on health care, enhancing the 
quality o f health services, and increase the regulatory, planning and policy-making capacity 
o f the MOH. A “business plan” to map out a strategy for achieving the above objectives was 
prepared, which has been used by MOH to: (i) pass a law for implementing a comprehensive 
emergency care program; (ii) start the design o f a basic benefit package o f health services for 
financing through the public health insurance system; and (iii) develop a drug policy 
comparable to EU standards and practices. Resources for implementing these reforms w i l l 

5 5 

Annex C 

come from the State and the National Health Insurance Fund (NFZ). No external financing i s 
required: resources were included in the budget for 2007 and provisions have been made in 
the budgets for 2008 and 2009 . I n addition, the Bank supported the NFZ in conducting a 
needs assessment to strengthen the health management information system and build 
analytical capacity at the NFZ. The NFZ plans to finance the implementation o f next steps 
suggested in these assessments. The Government also actively participated in Bank- 
organized workshops in Slovenia on private-public collaboration in health (December 2006 ) , 
and in Hungary on pharmaceutical governance (February 2 0 0 7 ) . 

Pillar 2: Convergence/Competitiveness 

(a) Improve the business climate 

18 . There has been an improvement in the business environment since 2005 despite a 
slight deterioration in Poland’s ranking from 74 to 76 i n the ease of doing business as 
reported in the 2009 Doing Business Report. This deterioration has resulted from other 
countries reforming their business environments more aggressively than Poland rather than 
from a deterioration o f the environment in Poland. I n fact, there has been steady progress in 
business confidence in Poland as evidenced by increasing levels o f both domestic and foreign 
investment. Despite these positive signs, a dynamic business climate requires continuous 
policy refinement and reform. The Bank’s ROSC assessments o f accounting and auditing, 
and corporate governance, and the report on Obstacles to Contract Enforcement identified 
important prospective reforms which are incorporated in the strategic documents prepared by 
the Government for implementation by 2009 . In particular they include: (i) the reform o f 
business, land and collateral registries, and o f legal information system; (ii) automation o f 
registers and courtrooms; and (iii) enhancing the skills o f the workforce, including judges, 
Ministry o f f ic ia ls , court s ta f f etc., to improve the productivity and performance o f public 
officials. Various development partners such as the EU, Norway, and the World Bank are 
expected to assist the Government finalize its approach and implement the reforms. 

19 . The financial sector i s performing relatively well amid the global turmoil, but 
several developmental challenges remain and these have been exacerbated lately. The 
sector has been expanding steadily over the las t five to six years, primarily due to the pension 
and insurance sectors, but banking has also grown and its indicators are generally positive, 
although some risks are emerging related to a large increase in foreign currency lending. The 
level o f financial intermediation has been increasing, but i t remains lower than the regional 
average. I n addition, much o f the growth in bank credit i s attributable to housing finance, 
which has grown faster than overall bank finance, suggesting a slowdown in corporate 
financing. A weak information environment may be a cause o f the slowdown in corporate 
lending, in particular as i t relates to the operation o f credit information bureaus. Several o f 
the Bank’s recommendations in this area provided in a series o f financial sector policy notes 
and an update o f the FSAP have been taken on board by the Government and are now being 
implemented. The unification o f supervisory functions under the Financial Supervision 
Authority in 2007 was a significant step forward. 

2 0 . There has been limited progress in improving the effectiveness, efficiency and 
friendliness o f the public environmental financing system to the private capital market. 
W h i l e the targets for the share o f private funds in the sector operational program for 
environment were increased in the final Government document compared to the 2005 
proposal, achieving these targets w i l l require further efforts and concrete public financial 
products to attract private financial institutions to environmental investments. Bank e f f o r t s to 

56 

Annex C 

work with the Government to strengthen the public environmental financing system in the 
2007-201 3 EU financing period were limited to a diagnostic assessment o f Poland’s progress 
towards meeting environmental commitments o f the National Environmental Policy and the 
EU Accession Treaty obligations, and an analysis o f environmental and water management 
priorities o f structural instruments o f the NDS 2007-201 3. 

(b) Improve infrastructure 

2 1. 
There have been continued improvements in infrastructure, in particular in road 
and r a i l transport, but also in the energy sector and in flood prevention. I n the road 
sector, there has been some progress, although slower than initially anticipated, in the 
modernization o f the national road agency (GDDKiA), including the preparation o f a 
modernization action plan, implementation o f which w i l l require a c lea r Government 
commitment. GDDKiA i s now able to develop rolling multi-annual expenditure programs, 
which are based on objective, economic criteria; the annual programs for 2006 and 2007 
have been generated largely on the basis o f these criteria. The design o f a Management 
Information System has been completed and i s now being implemented with expected 
completion in 2009. There has also been continuous and measurable improvement in the 
quality o f the national road network. The percentage o f roads in good condition has increased 
from 45.5 percent in 2004 to 54.9 percent in 2007, and the backlog o f roads in bad condition 
declined from 25.8 percent in 2004 to 22.5 percent in 2007. The yearly program o f 
rehabilitation o f roads in the national network has been implemented in f w l l during calendar 
years 2004-2006 with the support o f the Bank through i t s series o f three Road Maintenance 
and Rehabilitation loans pooling resources with the state budget together with parallel 
financing from the European Investment Bank (EIB). The use o f these resources has been 
closely linked to progress in the modernization and capacity building activities supported by 
the Bank as described above. 

22. Progress in the railway sector has been mixed. The restructuring o f the national 
railway company (PKP Group) has not been fully implemented, and although there 
have been improvements in labor productivity and finances o f the railway sector, 
several challenges remain to ensure the financial sustainability o f the sector. Reforms 
supported by a Bank loan that closed in December 2005 helped improve labor productivity 
by reducing staffing levels from 190,000 to 145,000, and splitting the previous monolithic 
company into a number o f separate businesses within a holding structure. However, the 
assets have not yet been fwlly allocated and transferred to the different companies, and their 
outstanding debt has not been fully waived or restructured. Policy dialogue continued under 
the Bank’s Roads I1 loan and focused on regional passenger services, preparatory work for 
the privatization o f cargo services and the development o f economic plans for the 
rehabilitation o f transport infrastructure. Responsibility for financing and subsidizing 
regional passenger services was devolved to regional self-governments contributing to a 
change from a loss o f just over PLN 2 billion in 2004 to a profit o f PLN 18 million in 2007, 
still below the expectations at the start o f the restructuring process. Standards and required 
levels o f passenger service have not yet been finalized; leaving room for further 
improvement in this area. Contracts on the standards and levels o f service have not yet been 
finalized; this includes performance contracts between the holding and subsidiary companies 
and between the holding company and the Government. Consequently, there i s no c lear 
agreement on future infrastructure standards, quality o f service, strategy for financing the 
backlog o f maintenance and reduction o f operating costs. There has been no concrete 
progress on privatization, which was largely a result o f strong trade union resistance and 
insufficient political impetus. The latest strategy paper for the railway sector adopted by the 

57 

Government in 2007 and currently under implementation aims to resolve gradually most o f 
the outstanding issues. 

’ 

Annex C 

23. 

Improvements were made in improving Poland’s seaport and maritime 
infrastructure. Polish ports are handling approximately 30 percent o f total foreign trade, so 
the current governmental strategy or seaports infrastructure development, adopted in 2007, 
aims at further improvement in competitiveness o f the Polish ports through their 
modernization and development with approximately Euro 700 million earmarked for their 
development until 2013. As part o f a Port Sector Modernization Program that began in 1996 
and focused on institutional reform and improved connections with land transportation 
networks, the Bank supported a second phase during this CPS period with an investment loan 
focusing on the Szczecin-Swinoujscie port complex and seaway. The loan aimed to improve 
port capacity to handle container traffic and to clarify and consolidate the division o f roles 
’ and responsibilities between public port authorities and private port operators. Successful 
civil works were undertaken to reinforce the embankment o f the Piastowski canal, which 
significantly improved navigational safety by sheltering vesse ls from strong, irregular 
currents; rebuild the breakwaters to prevent deterioration o f the channel; provide navigation 
lights on breakwater heads to improve t ra f f ic safety; slope protection along the banks o f the 
Katowice Peninsula and construction o f new berthing fac i l i t ies on Grabowski Island. Two 
c iv i l works activities that were not completed: (i) the containment fa c i l i ty , and (ii) unfinished 
works on Katowicki Peninsula. Traffic cargo and container traffic increased, although this 
may be due, in part, to strong global growth. I n addition, the project provided significant 
technical assistance to the seaway authorities in environmentally safe disposal methods for 
contaminants. Finally the project facilitated the concession agreement that has established a 
private operator in Szczecin port. 

24. 
The program fo r the prevention o f floods in the Od ra River Basin has been 
finalized with technical support under the Bank supported Emergency Flood Recovery 
project which was completed in 2005 and i s now being implemented. The EUR 505 
million flood prevention program w i l l be financed with resources from the Government o f 
Poland, EU Cohesion Funds, the Council o f Europe Development Bank and a Euro 140 
million World Bank loan approved in March 2007. The program aims to eliminate the risk o f 
flooding, loss o f l i f e and damage to property for a population o f more than 2 .5 million people 
in towns and rural settlements in three provinces in the Lower S i l e s i a region. The project aim 
w i l l be achieved through the construction o f infrastructure as well as continued institutional 
strengthening aimed at better preparedness for emergencies through improvements in flood 
forecasting and management. The Bank i s currently providing support on the resettlement 
plan in relation to the Raciborz dry polder. 

25. 
I n the energy sector, the Government i s still working within the general 
framework o f the “Poland Energy Policy Un t i l 2025.” I t has adopted a specific “Program 
for the Power Sector” which maps out the way ahead in opening the electricity market 
according to the EC Electricity Directive. Some progress has been achieved in transferring 
the transmission system assets to an independent transmission system operator but there i s 
scope for improving the regulatory framework to create more competition and protect 
consumer interests. The Bank stands ready to support the Government in the implementation 
o f this Program. Another concern i s that progress on implementing energy efficiency 
measures remains slow and that grant funds for energy efficiency in public sector buildings 
(especially structural funds) are used inefficiently with l i t t l e leveraging o f private sector 
finance. The Bank’s Krakow Energy Efficiency Project has demonstrated a replicable model 

5 8 

Annex C 

o f combining grant funds w i th commercial finance through Energy Service Companies 
(ESCOs). 

(c) Develop the knowledge economy 

26. Since 2004, there has been sustained progress in developing the Knowledge 

Economy in Poland. Legislation on an Innovation Fund w i th Government and EU financing 
has been enacted (embodying the concept proposed in the Bank’s Knowledge Economy 
Assessment (KEA)) to provide grants to innovating f i r m s . A Capital Fund (similar to the one 
proposed i n the K E A ) has been established to provide seed capital, and legislation i s being 
considered to a l ter the incentives for state owned research institutes by providing a V A T 
rebate when revenues from the commercial sector exceed 50 percent. The Government has 
also adopted a strategy for L i f e Long Learning, one o f the education sector reforms proposed 
in the KEA. EU accession has driven the liberalization o f the I C T sector, along w i th product 
and labor markets. 

Pillar 3: Employment and Poverty 
(a) Support employment creation 

27. After years o f stagnation and even negative growth, employment started to 
increase in 2005 and especially in 2006 with total employment (14.67 million) reaching 

its highest level in the decade. Overall, employment increased by 600,000 net new jobs 
since the end o f 2004, mainly as a result o f robust economic growth and increasing 
investment. However, the employment ra te i s s t i l l one o f the lowest in the EU. Increasing 
employment w i l l continue to be one o f Poland’s critical challenges. This issue has featured 
prominently in the Bank’s M A work: i t was raised in the regional study on in terna l labor 
Reports (labor taxation - A p r i l 2005, sustainability o f pension systems - October 2005, 
mob i l i ty (FY06) and earlier in several special topics o f the Quarterlymegular Economic 
sources o f economic growth - February 2006, public f inances - M a y 2006, international 
migration - September 2006), EU8 cross-country fiscal studies (higher education - F Y 2005, 
vocational education and social assistance - F Y 2006), and the informal po l icy note for the 
new Government (autumn 2005). Bank studies supported the public debate on impediments 
affecting weak labor market performance in Poland and the labor tax wedge was reduced. 
Further adjustments o f the social security system are anticipated in the DPL loan ser ies . 

(b) Increase level of social inclusion 

28. Along with gradually declining unemployment and poverty, social exclusion also 
shows a declining trend, although not at the same pace. Progress i s being made i n 

increasing delivery o f social services geared towards promoting social inclusion in 500 leas t 
developed communities through the implementation o f the Bank-financed Post Accession 
Rural Support Project (PARSP). Local social integration strategies have been completed and 
4,606 contracts for the delivery o f social services have been signed and are now being 
implemented. The project has been praised by local officials and c i v i l society activists for i t s 
innovative approach and impact i n mobilizing local communities for social integration. 

59 

Annex C 

VI. Bank Performance 

a) Strategic Relevance, Impact 

29 . As noted, the CPS framework and overall priorities were broadly appropriate. 
The three overall CPS priorities - f i s c a l consolidation, convergencehompetitiveness, and 
employment and poverty - have continued to be relevant to the development challenges 
faced by Poland. These priorities also match the broad areas where the Bank could expect to 
provide continued value added to Poland’s development agenda. The flexible nature o f the 
CPS, with Bank activities determined as part o f annual business plans agreed with the 
Government, also underscored the demand orientation o f the Bank’s involvement with an 
advanced middle income country and helped address the lack o f continuity in an uncertain 
political environment by allowing for changes in the Bank program during CPS 
implementation. 

30. But CPS implementation f e l l short in terms of its strategic relevance, overall 
coherence and impact. On the lending side, the Bank focused i t s involvement on a number 
o f niche areas where i t had developed i t s reputation for technical excellence and had strong 
connections with counterpart institutions. As a result, Bank lending continued in road 
transport and flood protection, social support in rural areas as follow-up to the earlier ru ra l 
development lending, and final involvement in the coal mining sector based on the Bank’s 
long standing involvement. The AAA program in turn was rather piecemeal with limited 
connections t o the lending program. I t lacked core or flagship products such as a Public 
Expenditure and Institutional Review (PEIR), L iv ing Standards Assessment, and Knowledge 
Economy Assessment undertaken in the previous CAS. While there were important activities 
clustered around a set o f financial sector activities (a series o f policy notes, FSAP update), 
sector policy dialogue (education, health, railways, energy, legal system), and ROSCs 
(corporate governance, accounting and auditing, insolvency and creditor rights), they had 
limited impact on the policy debate and only partially supported the overall CPS strategic 
framework. As noted also by a QAG rev ied ’ , which included a review o f six AAA activities 
implemented under the CPS, the A A A program was rather opportunistic and not adequately 
strategized upfront. While the internal quality o f the AAA work was generally considered to 
be o f high standard, QAG f e l t that the Bank’s comparative advantage in carrying out certain 
activities was not always apparent. I t also gave low ratings for both coherence and 
integration, and likely impact o f the AAA program. 

3 1 . The weak strategic orientation of CPS implementation reflected the nature o f the 
Bank’s dialogue in Poland which lacked a strong anchor and coordination on 
Government side. The Bank’s dialogue was largely bottom-up and built on the strong 
connections i t had built with selected ministries and agencies. For much o f the CPS period, 
the Ministry o f Finance showed limited interest in cooperating with the Bank as i t was 
ambivalent about Bank lending in Poland in view o f i t s improved access to market finance 
and the ample availability o f EU grant funds. I n the absence o f another coordination point 
for Bank involvement, the Bank built its activities around connections and demand from 
selected counterpart agencies. 

32. 
The recent re-engagement o f the Bank with the new Government has resulted in 
a more strategic approach around a set o f co r e policy areas. A t the center o f this dialogue 
has been a broad understanding with the Prime Minister’s Office and MOF on the nature o f 

’’ QAG Review carried out in FY06107 

60 

Annex C 

the Bank’s future involvement in support o f key policy areas closely linked to Poland’s 
future growth and convergence agenda. This has resulted in recent agreement on an 
integrated program o f policy lending and A A A focused on improvements in public finance 
management, employment, and private sector development. 

b) Quality o f Bank Services 
3 3 . 
I n tandem with Poland’s increased access to external finance, the Bank’s lending 
portfolio has reduced over the CPS period. During the period, four new lending projects 
were approved as foreseen at the time o f the CPS while eight projects closed. As a result, the 
lending po r t fo l io (before the recent approval o f the DPL) f e l l from 13 projects for a total net 
commitment o f about $1.4 b i l l ion in FY05 to 7 projects w i th total commitment o f $734 
m i l l ion in FY09. Until the recent approval o f the Public Finance Management, Employment 
and Private Sector Development DPL, the lending portfolio in Poland was declining and 
entirely made up o f investment projects w i th a strong infrastructure orientation bu i l t around a 
se r ies o f roads rehabilitation projects, as we l l as railways, flood emergency/protection, rural 
development, and two coal sector operations (social mitigation and mine closure). The roads 
projects used a sector-wide (SWAP) design which allowed for quick disbursement o f Bank 
h n d s in support o f the Government budget for road rehabilitation and maintenance and 
which was extended as part o f the two roads projects approved during the CPS period. 
34. 
The quality o f the lending portfolio has been mixed. As shown in the table below, 
despite a declining po r t fo l io both the number o f problem projects and the commitments at 
risk o f active projects in the portfolio has increased over the CPS period. In addition, I EG 
rated the outcomes o f two o f the eight closed projects as marginally unsatisfactory 
(geothermal district heating and environment, and coal mine closure). Sustainability o f 
outcomes was considered ‘ l ike ly ’ for six operations, and for the other two (hard coal social 
mitigation and coal mine closure) I EG found that there was moderate and significant risk to 
development outcome. W i th one exception (the geothermal project), Bank performance was 
considered satisfactory. The e a r l i e r strong disbursement performance also weakened over the 
CPS period as the quick disbursing roads projects came to an end and the more recent 
projects (post-accession rural support, Odra flood protection) d id not p ick up the 
disbursement pace. Somewhat surprisingly i n view o f Poland’s advanced status, the portfolio 
has suffered from a number o f implementation problems which have resulted in delays and 
weaker than expected outcomes. These involve institutional weaknesses, including slow 
establishment o f project implementation organizations, excessive bureaucracy in decision 
making, turnover o f project staff, and inter-agency problems.

3 5 . Despite the rather weak strategic orientation and coherence o f the AAA program 
noted above, the quality of individual AAA activities has generally been good. Desp i te 
an overall reduced involvement in Poland, the Bank continues to have a high reputation for 
i t s knowledge and analytical work. The QAG AAA review undertaken in FY06/07 for 
activities undertaken during FY02-06 (including six activities during the CPS period) rated 
the overall in terna l quality o f the products sampled as satisfactory, including for the quality 
o f analysis and o f conclusions and recommendations o f the 
individual products. 
Participation, consultation and dissemination efforts were seen as a particularly strong 
element o f the Bank’s A A A activities i n Poland. There was considerable involvement by 
Polish counterparts, academics, institutes and local consultants. Dissemination in many cases 
involved workshops and conferences, involvement o f the media, and translation into Polish 
language. But as mentioned, the rapid turnover o f counterparts in the Polish administration 
diminished the ownership and impact o f the Bank’s AAA activities. Under these 
circumstances arguably even more should have been done to pub l ic ly disseminate the Bank’s 
work and 
to 
involve non-governmental partners, as much o f the analysis and 
recommendations has a shelf l i f e that exceeds the tenure o f a particular government. Overall, 
QAG assigned a moderately satisfactory rating for the AAA activities i t reviewed. QAG’s 
conclusions on the quality o f Bank’s A A A i n Poland continue to be relevant for activities 
undertaken i n FY07-08 given the nature o f the much reduced AAA output i n these years. On 
a positive note, mention should be made o f the considerable impact and v is ib i l i ty of the 
Bank’s regional economic studies, particularly the ongoing EU8+2 Quarterly Economic 
Reports and the se r ies o f EU8 Fiscal Policy Studies undertaken in 2005, 2006 and 2007, 
which addressed key areas relevant to improving f i s c a l management in Poland and the other 
new EU members. Each o f these reports received broad public attention in Poland and helped 
maintain the good name o f the Bank in te rms o f i t s analytical work and regional/global 
knowledge. 

c) Delivery o f Bank Services 

36. Most o f the Bank activities foreseen f o r FYO5-06 as pa r t o f the flexible CPS 
framework were undertaken, although some AAA activities were suspended given 
changes in counterparts and Government priorities. A l l four o f the new lending projects 
envisaged in the CPS (Roads maintenance and rehabilitation I1 and 111, Post-accession rural 
support, and Odra river basin flood protection) were prepared, approved and launched, albeit 
w i th some delays. Total new lending commitments during FY05-07 exceeded CPS 
expectations (ac tua l commitments o f US$709.5 m i l l i o n equivalent as compared w i th the 
$620-680 m i l l ion range foreseen in the CPS). Similarly, most o f the AAA activities 
envisaged for FY05-06 were undertaken although some were suspended given the change o f 
counterparts fo l low ing the changes o f government i n 2005 and 2006. A few significant 
additional AAA activities were undertaken i n FY06 beyond those foreseen in the CPS, 
including an FSAP Update, a Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA), and a 
Transition Brief for the then new Government outlining Poland’s key policy challenges and 
possible role o f the Bank. Attachments 2 and 3 show details o f the lending and non-lending 
activities included in the CPS and their ac tua l status, together w i th any additional activities 
carried out. 

37. But beyond FY06, new Bank activities were much reduced until a renewed 
engagement with the new Government took shape in FYOS-09. Du r ing FY06-07, Bank 
involvement was reduced to monitoring the portfolio o f ongoing projects and a few A A A 
activities which bu i l t on the Bank’s previous involvement (see Annex 2 for details). I n 
tandem, the quarterly Regional Economic Reports and regional fiscal studies kept up the 

62 

Annex C 

visibility o f the Bank’s ana ly t ica l work in Poland. Only with engagement o f the new 
Government starting in early 2008 did a new program o f Bank activities start to emerge 
which i s now being launched, centered around a Programmatic Policy Loan and related AAA 
activities in public finance management, labor markets and employment, pensions and social 
assistance, private sector development, healthcare and education sector reform. 

38 . Wo rk 
i s now underway to develop AAA services under reimbursable 
arrangements to respond to demands for more specialized work or demands which exceed 
the program foreseen in the CPS. Government interest for these services includes such areas 
as implementation o f the power market program, housing rental policy, ownership policies 
for SOEs, and performance budgeting. These reimbursable arrangements are particularly 
relevant for development o f a new line o f Bank AAA services at the sub-national level. Such 
sub-national business has considerable promise in Poland and initial engagement with a 
number o f regions and municipalities has shown the potential for future Bank involvement 
on reimbursable basis. 

d) Country dialogue 

39 . As noted, the Bank’s country dialogue in Poland was problematic given the 
frequent changes in government and lack o f coordination o f Bank activities on the 
Polish side. While fo r much o f the CPS period the Ministry o f Finance showed limited 
interest i n both Bank analytical work and financing given availability o f other sources o f 
funds, the Bank continued i t s engagement with selected ministries and agencies with which i t 
had developed strong relations in the past. This led to a rather opportunistic, bottom-up 
approach in formulating the Bank’s role and activities in Poland. The flexible CPS 
framework with Bank activities determined as part o f annual business plans to be agreed with 
Government was an appropriate approach in the case o f Poland but could not be fully 
implemented given the lack o f a clear coordination point for Bank activities. The overriding 
attention o f the administration to meeting the needs o f the EU following EU membership 
contributed to the difficulties in engaging the Government. 

V I I . Overall Assessment and Lessons 

40. The CPS was designed and implemented in a challenging country context. On the 
whole, Poland performed well during the period o f CPS design and implementation. I t had 
just achieved i t s overriding objective o f EU membership in May 2004. Economic growth 
accelerated to the 6 percent per year range aided by a stable macroeconomic framework and 
favorable external conditions. This helped accelerate implementation o f Poland’s overriding 
goal o f moving towards income convergence with the EU. High unemployment was sharply 
reduced and poverty f e l l during the period. EU membership also facilitated Poland’s access 
to ample external funds which reduced the interest in Bank financing. A t the same time, 
frequent changes in government officials contributed to a slowdown in Poland’s reform 
momentum. With much o f the administration’s attention focused on meeting the needs o f the 
EU and i t s institutions, and in the absence o f a clear statement o f the Bank’s value-added v is - 
a-vis other external partners, the Government’s interest i n a continued strategic engagement 
with the Bank was limited for most o f the CPS period. 

41. 
I n this context, the design o f the CPS was generally appropriate. I t set up a more 
flexible, demand-driven arrangement around a broad se t o f strategic themes: f i s c a l 
consolidation, convergence/competitiveness, and employment and poverty. These priorities 
also match the areas where the Bank could expect to provide continued value added to 

63 

Annex C 

Poland’s development agenda. The flexible nature o f the CPS, with Bank activities 
determined as part o f annual business plans agreed with the Government, was appropriate for 
the engagement with an advanced M IC and helped address the lack o f continuity in an 
uncertain political environment by allowing for changes in the Bank program during CPS 
implementation. 

42. But CPS implementation was mixed with insufficient strategic focus and 
cohesion. The Bank focused i t s continued involvement on a number o f niche areas where i t 
had developed i t s reputation for technical excellence and had strong connections with 
counterpart institutions. But without an anchor in the MOF, the AAA program was rather 
piecemeal, lacked core products and had only limited impact on the domestic policy debate. 
I n the absence o f a more strategic engagement with Poland the Bank may have continued too 
long in a fairly traditional country relationship based on a mix o f investment lending and ad 
hoc AAA ac t iv i t ies rather than moving to a more selective knowledge partnership. 

43. 
The recent re-engagement o f the Bank with Poland has resulted in a more 
strategic approach around a set o f co r e policy areas. A t the center o f this dialogue has 
been a broad understanding with MOF and the Prime Minister’s Office on the nature o f the 
Bank’s future involvement i n support o f key policy areas closely linked to Poland’s growth 
and convergence agenda. This has resulted in recent agreement on an integrated program o f 
policy lending and AAA focused on improvements i n public finance management, 
employment, and private sector development.

Lessons learned: 
Establish a flexible framework o f activities that can be scaled up o r down 
’ according to client interest: 
o Establish a strategic and cohesive program o f Bank activities that i s not 
wholly dependent upon one counterpart or one instrument; 
o Maintain a core set o f Economic and Sector work (ESW) and diagnostic 
products as a basis for scaling up or developing new activities; 
o Be prepared to scale down or disengage i f the Bank’s involvement i s 
perceived to lack strategic focus or impact and switch gradually to a 
knowledge-based partnership through reimbursement agreements. 

0 Define the Bank’s ro le and value added: 
o Establish clearly the Bank’s role and value-added vis-a-vis other external 
partners and funding sources such as the EU, European Investment Bank 
(EIB), EBRD and OECD; 
o Practice selectivity i n Bank involvement i n terms o f areas o f involvement and 
modalities o f support, focusing on the knowledge agenda; 
o Test Bank involvement against the c r i te r ia defined as areas o f Bank 
value-added, strategic relevance and impact. 

0 Manage political transitions: 
o Seek continuity o f dialogue by developing relations at technical levels o f the 
civil service; 
o Maintain contacts across the political spectrum and with strategic non- 
Government partners and sub-national entities; 
o To the extent possible, align CPS cycles around electoral cycles.
