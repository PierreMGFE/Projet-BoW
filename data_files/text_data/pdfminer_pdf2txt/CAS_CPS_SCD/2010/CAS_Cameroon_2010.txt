Since the W o r l d B a n k B o a r d o f D i rec to rs last discussed a C o u n t r y Ass is tance 
Strategy (CAS ) fo r Cameroon in September o f 2003,’ m u c h has changed in the g l o b a l 
economic c l ima te and with respect t o the country’s future t ra jec to ry . The g loba l s l ow d ow n 
has resulted in a s ign i f ican t con t rac t ion o f Cameroon’s exports other than o i l , no tab ly 
timber, rubber and cotton, and long -hoped f o r investments in the mining sector have been 
indefinitely postponed. While s ign i f ican t re fo rms we re unde r taken over t h e p e r i o d since the 
las t C A S was elaborated, m u c h remains t o be done t o improve development effectiveness 
and transparent, e f f ic ien t u s e o f resources in o rde r t o unlock Cameroon’s po ten t ia l .

Cameroon: Vast potential, but with constraints 
Cameroon’s macroeconomic pe r fo rmance has strengthened in recen t years. Debt

Cameroon’s cen t ra l challenge i s t o s t imu la te a robus t rate o f g row th , and t o ensure 
this i s equ i tab ly shared amongst the popu la t ion in order t o reduce pove r ty . The coun t ry ’s 
governance d e f i c i t constitutes a m a j o r obstacle in ach iev ing this, as evidenced in weak 
public expenditure management and a highly cen t ra l ized state mach ine ry that has few 
d ow nw a r d linkages t o those mos t in need. A p o o r bus iness c l ima te unde rm ines Cameroon’s 
competitiveness and g r ow t h prospects, as does s ign i f ican t unde r inves tmen t in c r i t i c a l 
in f ras t ruc tu re that c o u l d imp rove service de l ive ry and broaden econom ic growth b o t h at 
na t iona l and reg iona l levels. To tha t end, Cameroon’s economy must become mo re 
compe t i t ive and p u b l i c f inanc ia l management must imp rove , c rea t ing a favo rab le

Cameroon Country Assistance Strategy 
Inclusive Growth 

1, 

Since the Wo r ld Bank Board o f Directors last discussed a Country Assistance Strategy 
(CAS) fo r Cameroon in September o f 2003 , much has changed in the global economic climate 
and with respec t to the country’s future trajectory. O i l revenue, on wh ich the Government o f 
Cameroon (GoC) i s heavily dependent, has fluctuated w i ld ly . The global slowdown has 
resulted in a significant contraction o f Cameroon’s other export commodities, notably timber 
and cotton, and long-hoped fo r investments in the m in ing sector have been inde f in i te ly 
postponed. The previous CAS was developed in the wake o f Cameroon’s first Poverty 
Reduction Strategy (PRSP), and an Interim Strategy No te ( I S N ) bridged Fiscal Years 2007 and 
2008 so that Government could complete i ts updated poverty reduction strategy, wh ich has 
only come to fm i t i o n in August 2009 . Desp i te the delays associated w i t h the elaboration o f the 
“Growth and Employment Strategy” (DSCE), the process demonstrated strong buy - in fo r bo th 
i t s v is ion and po l icy directions. This underpins GoC’s stated intention to refocus i t s efforts on 
economic development and poverty reduction, a necessity made a l l the more stark b y 
stagnating growth and pe rs is ten t poverty over the previous CAS period. Wh i le significant 
reforms were undertaken over the period since the last CAS was elaborated, inc lud ing reforms 
under the H i g h l y Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Completion po in t in 2006 , and the successful 
2005 -2009 International Monetary Fund (IMF) Poverty Reduction and G row th Fac i l i ty (PRGF) 
program, much remains to be done to improve development effectiveness and transparent, 
efficient use o f resources in order to unlock Cameroon’s potential.

O n the Wo r ld Bank side, the ins t i tu t ion i s poised to transform the way that i t engages 
w i t h Cameroon, evolving in to a trusted partner that continues to provide pragmatic, strategic, 
and focused investment lending and analytic and advisory activities. This CAS mirrors 
Government’s v is ion fo r economic growth, but in a manner that produces benefits fo r a l l 
Cameroonians, expressed as this CAS ’ umbrella o f “Inclusive Growth”. The Cameroonian 
economy needs to not on ly maintain i t s delicate equilibrium in these t ry ing times, but make 
strides to transform in to a more robust, diversified, and competitive economy. S e r v i c e delivery 
too demands improvement in terms o f access and quality o f services. Last, bo th government 
strategy documents and the CAS i t s e l f acknowledge the key role that governance w i l l p lay in 
this transformation. 

I. Cameroon: Vast potential, but with constraints 

3 . 

Cameroon i s a linguistically and ethnically diverse country whose geography ranges 
f rom Sahelian sem i -dese r t in the no r th through grassland to equatorial forest in the south. This 
diversity favors varied economic and agricultural activities, though in reality 70 percent o f the 
population depends on agriculture and pastoral activities fo r their livelihood. Cameroon has one 
o f the highest proportions o f land area devoted to conservation in Africa, with some 14 percent 
o f the country’s territory designated as national parks, rese rves , sanctuaries and conservation 
concessions. Cameroon also exports o i l and has significant natural resources, inc lud ing h igh - 
value timber spec ies ; agricultural products inc lud ing coffee, cotton, and cocoa; and as yet 
untapped natural gas, iron, bauxite, and cobalt.

Since i t s independence, Came roon has en joyed a degree o f p o l i t i c a l s tab i l i ty that i s

1982, and was peace fu l ly succeeded by Pau l B iya , who founded the Came roon People’s 

Democ ra t ic Movement and r a n a single pa r ty system. F o l l o w i n g popular unres t , a multi-party

Mac roeconom ic Management. Came roon i s a member o f a mone ta ry u n i o n with a

F isca l p o l i c y i s thus the m a i n ins t rumen t available to the authorities. In this regard, their 
medium-term f isca l strategy re f lec ts the nonrenewable nature o f o i l revenues and the need to 
address obstacles t o growth, while p rese rv ing debt sustainability. The strategy a ims at limiting 
f isca l d e f i c i t s while o i l revenues are s ign i f ican t so that future generations are n o t faced with a 
renewed debt burden. O i l revenues and available prudent b o r r ow i n g shou ld be e f fec t ive ly used 
t o f inance g row th -enhanc ing investments. This strategy i s ensured by ma in ta in ing a mode ra te ly

Debt Sus ta inab i l i ty . Cameroon’s debt s i tua t ion has sharply im p r o v e d in recent years. 
I t s p u b l i c debt-to- GD P ra t io dec l ined f r o m 51.8 percent in 2005 t o 9.8 percent in 2008 
(US$2.28 b i l l ion ) , thanks t o H I P C and M u l t i l a t e r a l Debt Relief I n i t i a t i v e (MDRI) r e l i e f in 2006 
and prudent b o r r ow i n g po l ic ies since then. Since the H I P C I n i t i a t i v e and MDRI debt re l ie f , the 
further dec l ine in external debt has re f lec ted the f o l l ow i n g : (i) a reduc t ion in n e t b o r r ow i n g by 
p u b l i c en te rp r ises ; (ii) the settlement o f mos t L o n d o n C l u b comme rc ia l creditors; and (iii) 
va lua t ion effects due t o changes in the exchange rate. O n domestic debt, substantial repayments 
were also made possible due t o the use o f w i n d f a l l gains f r o m higher-than-expected o i l p r ices 
in 2008.

Though the compos i t ion o f external p u b l i c debt i s cu r ren t ly skewed t ow a r d b i la te ra l

because o f the g loba l f inanc ia l c r i s i s and economic s lowdown , debt indicators are somewhat 
higher than in the 2008 analysis. I t i s also no tewo r thy that persistent weakness in p u b l i c finance

Recent E c o n om i c Deve lopmen ts . Cameroon’s mac roeconom ic performance has

C. Governance Conditions 
13. 
Ev idence shows Cameroon’s weak t rack reco rd with respect t o s t imu la t ing g row th . 
Despite the coun t ry ’s 
tremendous natural, human, and f inanc ia l resources, economic 
performance remains dec ided ly modest. N o n - o i l g r ow t h has averaged o n l y 4.2 percent over the 
past 5 years, well b e l ow Government’s ambitions, w h i c h sets i t s future annual goal at 10 
percent. Statistics also show that wha t l i t t l e g r ow t h i s generated i s n o t being distributed in an 
equitable, p ro -poo r manner. At least one exp lana t ion f o r th is i s governance, w h i c h continues t o 
pose a m a j o r challenge t o Cameroon’s development potential. Kau fmann -K raay Governance 
ind ica to rs show that Cameroon ranks under the 25‘h pe rcen t i le f o r a l l criteria, with con t ro l o f 
co r rup t ion at the 19th percentile, government effectiveness at the 20th percentile, and vo ice and 
accoun tab i l i ty at the 19‘h percentile. Cameroon’s IDA Resource A l l o c a t i o n index f o r 2008 i s at

D. Soc ia l Conditions 
14. While Cameroon i s o n t rack t o meet the MDG o n primary enrollment, i s s u e s rema in 
with regard t o educational qua l i ty , with a high pupil to teacher ratio, a lack o f adequate lea rn ing 
materials, etc. Cameroon’s expenditure o n education has g r ow n since 2000 by t a k i n g advantage 
o f funds released th rough debt re l ie f . The main r e s u l t s include the cons t ruc t ion o f 3,500 new 
classrooms t o reduce ove rc rowd ing ; salary increases t o mo t iva te teachers; rec ru i tmen t o f 
add i t iona l teachers; and the p r o v i s i o n each year o f a minimum package o f schoo l supplies t o a l l 
schools. B o t h en ro l lmen t rates and comp le t ion rates have im p r o v e d at the p r im a r y levels, as has 
gender equity. Came roon has made impressive strides in ensuring girls’ access t o education, 
with a female t o ma le r a t i o o f 85 percent in p r im a r y and secondary education. Furthermore, the 
sector has made great strides in equitable e f f ic iency by dep loy ing new contract teachers to 
schools with the greatest needs, thus reduc ing the va r ia t ion o f the pupil-teacher ratios. The 
government e l im ina ted school fees f o r p r im a r y school pupils 1999. This has l e d t o an increase 
in gross primary school en ro lmen t t o over 100 percent, but p rob lems remain. Governance 
constraints also impac t the effectiveness o f the education system across the sector. Stakeholders 
do n o t have easy access t o t im e l y and u s e f u l i n f o rm a t i o n o n the state o f the education system, 
accoun tab i l i ty mechanisms that ob l ige authorities at a l l l e v e l s t o make re levan t changes o r 
oppo r tun i t ies t o pa r t ic ipa te in the dec is ion -mak ing process. 

1 5 . 
Cameroon i s expe r ienc ing r a p i d popu la t ion g r ow t h at 2.7 percent and a high fer t i l i ty 
rate that averages five ch i ld ren per woman . There are large geographical va r ia t ions with the 
to ta l f e r t i l i t y rate (TFR) being as high as 6.1 ch i ld ren per w om a n in r u r a l areas. The high TFR 
i s partly a func t ion o f a l o w ove ra l l contraceptive prevalence rate, w h i c h i s 14 percen t 
nationwide but only 3 percent in the N o r t h e r n and Ex t reme N o r t h e r n Regions. Reduc ing 
f e r t i l i t y rates w i l l have m a n y bene f i ts as i t can be expected to: (i) im p r o v e women ’s hea l th and 
reduce ove ra l l maternal m o r t a l i t y by reducing the number o f high order births (fourth, fifth and 
h ighe r births) which are much riskier than l o w order births; (ii) reduce i n f a n t m o r t a l i t y rates b y 
increasing the in te rva l between births; (iii) h e l p empower w om e n by p r o v i d i n g them with 
choices about when and h o w m a n y children t o have; (iv) p r o v i d e a necessary cond i t ion f o r 
sustained and rapid economic g r ow t h by decreasing the dependency ra t io and by fac i l i ta t ing the 
5 

formation o f human capital (by a l low ing greater per child expenditures on education and 
health); and (v) reduce population p ressu res that further s t ress the fragile ecosystems o f the 
country (e.g. access to land, deforestation, food, and water supply, etc). 

16. 
Broader health outcomes are out o f synch w i t h the country’s potential and expenditures 
in the sector. Na t iona l statistical data hide large geographical and socioeconomic disparities in 
se rv ice delivery. Mos t key indicators o f child health and nu t r i t ion have actually worsened since 
1990 w i t h a few exceptions (e.g., immunization). The H I V / A I D S epidemic increases the risk o f 
exacerbating the poor health outcomes, with current seroprevalency es t ima tes at 5.1 p e r ~ e n t . ~ 
Cameroon’s overall epidemiologic p ro f i le corresponds to countries that spend dramatically 
less , reflecting important inefficiencies in the allocation o f resources and in the production o f 
health s e r v i c e s as well as major i n e q u i t i e s in the distribution o f human resources and the state 
o f facilities. The gender dimensions o f the health challenge are striking, w i t h maternal 
mortality at approximately 1,000 per 100,000 l ive births. N o t surprisingly, health sector 
performance i s also hindered b y governance issues , and mon i to r ing and evaluation o f health 
sector performance remains weak. 

17. 
Cameroonians are increasingly l i v i n g in urban areas, with a 56 percent urbanization rate

exceeding 6 pe rcen t per annum according to some estimates, compared w i t h 2.1 pe rcen t fo r the 
population as a whole. Douala and the capital city, Yaounde, are the ma in urban centers, w i t h 
populations o f 2 m i l l i o n and 1.7 m i l l i o n respectively. Urban growth occurred largely without 
the necessary investment in infrastructure, resulting in the growth o f in fo rma l suburban 
se t t lemen ts that offer a l o w standard o f l iv ing . Cameroon’s population i s young: an estimated 
41 - 2 percent are under the age o f 15, and 96.7 percen t are under 65.

Annex 4 shows that Cameroon continues to lag w i t h respec t to achieving the 
Millennium Development Goals, wh ich underscores the d i f f i c u l t y in gearing public po l icy

On ly one MDG i s w i t h i n reach b y 2015, but on ly i f reforms are sustained re la ted to ensuring

also unlikely to be met. 

E. Poverty and Inequality 
19. 
As previously noted, recent household data demonstrates that the average Cameroonian 
i s no better o f f than they were in 200 1, with poverty rates v i r tua l ly stagnating f rom 200 1-2007 
at 39.9 pe rcen t6 The survey also revealed that more than 5 5 percent o f ru ra l households are 
poor, as compared to on ly about 12 percent o f urban ones (changing f rom 52 and 17 percent, 
respectively, in 2001). As a result 87 percen t o f the poor were l i v i n g in ru ra l areas in 2007, up 
f rom 82 percent in 2001. However, these analyses may mask broader challenges faced b y the 
burgeoning urban population, whose cost o f l i v i n g i s generally higher than that o f ru ra l

20.

wea l thy fare re la t ive ly better, unde rsco r ing the i n a b i l i t y o f the state t o ensure an equitable

(Adamaoua, East, N o r t h and Ex t reme N o r t h ) experienced a s ign i f ican t increase between 200 1 
and 2007 w h i l e the ove ra l l pove r ty trend was stagnating. The t w o N o r t h e r n regions (No r th and 
Ex t reme North) saw the biggest increase, o f 13.6 and 9.6 percentage po in ts respectively. These 
po in ts underscore that pove r ty i s n o t being addressed in a comprehensive manner. This ca l ls

11. Cameroon’s main development challenges and opportunities 
22. 
Cameroon’s central challenge i s to stimulate a robus t rate o f growth, and t o ensure this 
i s equitably shared amongst the popu la t ion in order t o reduce pove r ty . The country’s 
governance d e f i c i t constitutes a major obstacle in ach iev ing this, as evidenced in weak p u b l i c 
expenditure management and a highly cen t ra l ized state mach ine ry that has few downwa rd 
linkages 
t o 
those mos t 
in need. A poo r bus iness c l ima te undermines Cameroon’s 
competitiveness and growth prospects, as does s ign i f ican t underinvestment in c r i t ica l 
in f ras t ruc tu re that cou ld imp rove service delivery and broader econom ic g r ow t h b o t h at 
na t iona l and reg iona l levels. T o that end, Cameroon’s economy must become more robust and 
competitive, creating a favorable env i ronmen t t o ensure the sustainable and transparent use o f 
the coun t ry ’s considerable na tu ra l resources. Such r e f o rm w o u l d attract k e y investments in 
several areas, i n c l u d i n g mining, tourism, and sma l l and medium enterprises l i n k e d t o 
agribusiness and industry (wood transformation, textiles). In the med ium - te rm , Cameroon must 
t rans fo rm i t s na tu ra l cap i ta l i n t o human and p roduc t ive cap i ta l in order t o achieve i t s 
aspirations t o become a middle income coun t ry by 2035. 

A. Improving governance to achieve inclusive growth 
23. 
Cameroon’s poor repu ta t ion f o r governance i s grounded in a severe b reakdown o f 
p u b l i c accountability. Checks against f raud and co r rup t ion are weak, and a lack o f i n f o rm a t i o n 
makes i t d i f f i c u l t f o r c i t izens and c i v i l society to h o l d governments accountable. L i t t l e 
i n f o rm a t i o n i s made p u b l i c o n development performance ind ica to rs . The p u b l i c i s n o t consulted 
be fo re enactment o f leg is la t ion o r g i v e n a r o l e in the oversight o f p u b l i c expenditures. C i t izens 
have d i f f i c u l t y h o l d i n g elected o f f i c i a l s and the executive b ranch o f gove rnmen t accountable, 
and the answe rab i l i ty o f service p rov ide rs t o elected o f f i c i a l s i s also f lawed . T h o u g h Cameroon 
has a reasonably sound 
lega l system, a disconnect exists between 
laws and their 
imp lemen ta t ion . Regulations o f ten subvert the intent o f the law , and laws are n o t adequately 
enforced. 

24. 
M o s t observers agree that the m a i n obstacle t o g r ow t h in Came roon at this t im e i s 
governance. As p rev ious ly cited, a cu l tu re o f impunity and pa t ron -c l ien t re la t ionsh ips pervades 
m a n y economic transactions and leve ls o f society. The “rules o f the game” 
that w o u l d 
encourage transparency and due process a re either unclear, unknown , o r n o t respected. As such, 
the g r ow t h seen today i s b o t h far under i t s po ten t ia l and subsequently, the b e n e f i t s o f g r ow t h 
are channeled t o those .least in need o f it. The government recognizes in i t s p u b l i c p o l i c y 
statements that governance i s a p r i n c i p a l constraint t o an im p r o v e d g r ow t h performance. 
Governance failures cons t ra in g r ow t h th rough three p r i n c i p a l mechanisms. First, they adversely 
a f fec t the investment c l ima te in a va r ie ty o f ways. Second, they increase the cost o f d o i n g 
business in Cameroon, and hence reduce cost-competitiveness. Third, p o o r p u b l i c f inanc ia l 
management and an ine f f ic ien t and sometimes co r rup t c i v i l service reduce the resources 
available t o finance p u b l i c inves tmen t and the effectiveness o f p u b l i c service de l ive ry . 

B. Weak public expenditure management 
25. 
De f ic ienc ies in p u b l i c f inanc ia l management contribute to Cameroon’s d isappo in t ing 
economic growth, hampe r ing the e f f i c i e n t use o f resources available to finance p u b l i c 
investment and service delivery. Recent analysis suggests that progress has been made in 
budget preparation, but p rob lems r em a i n with budget execu t ion and controls. With respec t t o 
the cap i ta l budget, f o r instance, a new procurement code has b rough t some improvement and a 
8 

regu la to ry agency f o r p rocu remen t i s n o w fully operational. Howeve r , limited in te rna l controls, 
weak accounting and reporting, and an absence o f adequate ex te rna l audit, h inde rs transparency 
and accoun tab i l i ty . Funds are also o f ten released late in the f isca l year, resu l t ing in excessive 
use o f ad hoc regulations and excep t iona l procedures. In te rgove rnmen ta l transfers lack 
transparency and l o c a l governments o f ten have inadequate f inanc ia l resources t o meet their 
spending responsibilities. 

2 6 . 

A lack o f i n f o rm a t i o n makes i t d i f f i c u l t f o r c i t izens and c i v i l society t o h o l d 
governments accountable. The qua l i ty and timeliness o f in -yea r budget reports and annual 
f inanc ia l statements i s de f ic ien t . Ex te rna l sc ru t iny i s weak with the Chamber o f Accoun ts and 
the N a t i o n a l Assemb ly h a v i n g l im i t e d access t o relevant f inanc ia l and budget i n f o rm a t i o n and 
n o capacity t o undertake their cons t i tu t iona l aud i t and ove rs igh t roles. Audit reports are no t 
p u b l i c l y available and l i t t l e i n f o rm a t i o n i s made p u b l i c o n development pe r fo rmance indicators. 
As in many deve lop ing countries, the task o f delivering services i s unde rcu t by the inadequate 
fund ing and co r rup t ion . L a c k o f comprehensiveness and transparency o f the budget (with 
s ign i f ican t expenditures o f f budget), 
large gaps between an t ic ipa ted and actual revenue 
collections, and weak con t ro l over pay ro l ls p l a y ‘a r o l e in reduc ing the funds available f o r 
service delivery and p u b l i c investment. 

C . O v e r - c e n t r a l i z a t i o n o f dec is ion -mak ing and execu t ion 
27 . 

Cameroon’s adm in is t ra t ion i s seen as mo re capable than mos t o f i t s neighbors, yet i t i s 
perceived as excessively cen t ra l ized with few downwa rd accoun tab i l i ty mechanisms. While 
Cameroon’s basic decen t ra l iza t ion leg is la t ion i s considered adequate, mos t o f i t i s yet t o be 
acted upon, no tab ly o n f isca l decentralization, s ta f f ing and o rgan iza t ion o f l o c a l governments, 
and deployment o f deconcentrated staff. L o c a l government i s bogged d o w n by the typ ica l 
issues in decen t ra l iz ing h igh ly -concen t ra ted francophone states. Cu r ren t i s s u e s p a r t l y s tem 
f rom the supe r impos i t ion o f a devo lved structure on to a deconcentrated state. The 
government’s decen t ra l iza t ion strategy recognizes in p r i n c i p l e the need f o r devo lv ing spending 
respons ib i l i t ies t o l o c a l governments while t rans fe r r ing at the same time the appropriate 
resources t o meet these n ew respons ib i l i t ies and avo id unfunded mandates. The nature o f these 
resources seems, however, unclear, as w e l l as the design o f any equa l iza t ion transfer 
mechanism t o a l l ow a l l l o c a l governments t o deliver the same qua l i ty o f p u b l i c services 
irrespective o f their o w n revenue base. In addition, the b o r r ow i n g p o l i c y o f l o c a l governments 
and the mechan ism b y w h i c h the center w i l l enforce ha rd budge t constraints need t o be 
developed. 

28 . 

A l t h o u g h the gove rnmen t allocates r o u g h l y 30 percent o f the inves tmen t spending t o the 
regions, i t re-centralizes t w o thirds o f this budget. O n average, each r e g i o n con t ro ls around 1 
percent o f the to ta l inves tmen t budget. The high cen t ra l iza t ion rates are o f ten ra t iona l ized by 
the lack o f capacity at the l o c a l leve l , the absence o f “ loca l ” f i r m s tha t can deliver adequate 
goods and services, o r economies o f scale b rough t about by large purchases o n l y the central 
government can make. Howeve r , the large ne two rk o f mo re than 3 5 0 loca l treasuries, a long 
with the fact that l o c a l governments have been dea l ing with p u b l i c p rocu remen t issues since at 
least 2002 does n o t lend support t o the ove r -cen t ra l iza t ion o f the inves tmen t budget. 

29 . 

Because l o c a l governments have superior i n f o rm a t i o n about l o c a l needs than the remote 
central administration, they are better able t o identify, and g iven appropriate capacity, de l ive r 

9 

the services their constituents want and need, and decen t ra l iz ing spending w o u l d enhance 
economic e f f ic iency . Ove r time, the e f f ic iency gains at the l o c a l l e v e l w o u l d lead t o better 
services and faster economic g r ow t h at b o t h the l o c a l and na t iona l levels. The government has 
v ow e d t o fu r the r the decentralization o f investment spending in the 2010 budget, but i t remains 
t o be seen i f the requ is i te human and f inanc ia l resources w i l l ac tua l ly be t rans fe r red . The scope, 
pace, and nature o f the transfer o f human and f inanc ia l resources w i l l need t o be ca re fu l ly 
managed in o rde r t o ensure that decen t ra l iza t ion r e s u l t s in better development outcomes at the 
l o c a l leve l . 

D.. Underinvestment in infrastructure 
30. 
As p rev ious ly noted, Came roon urgently needs t o upgrade i t s infrastructure, as i t 
constitutes a m a j o r bo t t leneck f o r competitiveness and g row th . I t i s o n l y th rough im p r o v e d 
access t o markets and services, greater r e l i a b i l i t y and l ow e r costs that connec t iv i ty and 
p r o d u c t i v i t y w i l l increase. Pub l ic inves tmen t c o u l d y i e l d impo r tan t social and economic 
re tu rns . T h r o u g h spending o n economic and social infrastructure, a government can p rov ide a 
strong boost t o GD P g r ow t h and pove r ty reduc t ion . Howeve r , f o r cap i ta l spending t o con t r ibu te 
t o growth, i t has t o be e f fec t ive and e f f i c i e n t . Ana lys is shows that p lanned p u b l i c investment in 
in f ras t ruc tu re has increased ma rked ly f r o m 2004 t o 2008, from l e s s than 20 percent in 2004 t o 
mo re than 40 percent in 2008. Infrastructure, however, rep resen ts a m u c h smaller share o f the 
treasury payments; i t represented 45 percent o f the planned inves tmen t outlays in 2008, only 19 
percent o f the actual payments went f o r in f ras t ruc tu re that same year.’’ 

31. 
N o n e o f the government’s p r i o r i t y sectors escape this pattern. In ene rgy , Cameroon’s 
hyd ropowe r po ten t ia l i s the third largest in Sub-Saharan A f r ica , estimated in excess o f 12,000 
megawatts. Howeve r , the to ta l ins ta l led e lec t r ic i ty generation capacity i s o n l y 933 megawatts, 
77 percent o f w h i c h i s h y d r o capacity and the remainder cos t ly the rma l capacity (diesel and 
heavy fuel o i l ) . In te lecommun ica t ions , the sector i s dom ina ted by the state-owned operator 
Cam te l and mos t other operators do n o t have broadband te r res t r ia l ne two rks and rely o n 
expensive and poo r qua l i ty satellite connec t iv i ty o r m i c r ow a v e backbones t o link c i t ies at the 
na t iona l leve l . T r a n s p o r t costs within Cameroon and in the C E M A C sub-region a re among the 
highest in the world (up to US$0 .20 pe r ton -k i lome te r compared to US$O.lO per ton -k i lome te r 
for East A f r i c a n land locked countries). Because o f the lack o f f inanc ia l resources, o n l y 2 9 
percent o f p r i o r i t y roads are consistently ma in ta ined and the ove ra l l cond i t ion o f the road 
network i s deteriorating. 

E. Competitiveness lagging, but possibilities a r e there 
32. 
Cameroon’s economy p resen ts a paradox, whereby i t possesses a massive resource 
base, but does n o t t rans fo rm th is i n t o sustained econom ic g r ow t h or pove r ty reduc t ion . T h e 
government recognizes the c r i t ica l impo r tance o f the p r iva te sector f o r ach iev ing the h ighe r 
growth rates needed t o reduce pove r ty . P o l i c y documents, however, p ro jec t p r iva te inves tmen t 
that i s s ign i f ican t ly higher than i t s h is to r ica l average and i s n o t expected t o be accompanied by 
a s im i la r expansion in the p u b l i c sector’s con t r ibu t ion t o gross cap i ta l fo rma t ion . The p r iva te 
sector requ i res a favorable investment c l ima te in order t o p l a y a c ruc ia l r o l e in making 
Came roon m o r e compe t i t ive . Howeve r , cond i t ions are at present decidedly n o t w o r k i n g in i t s 
favor, as h i g h l i g h t e d by the 2010 D o i n g Business Repo r t . Cameroon’s ove ra l l r a n k i n g places i t

E n f o r c i n g Contracts (1 74‘h) and Pay ing Taxes (1 70fh). These facts, coup led with the rea l i ty that 
mos t have stagnated o r go t ten worse in recent years, underscore that Cameroon’s attractiveness 
f o r the p r iva te sector i s e rod ing re la t ive t o other countries. The 2009 E n t e r p r i s e Survey t e l l s

f i r m s repo r t that dea l ing with government regu la t ion 
requirements represen ts 7 percent o f senior management time, 5 1 percent acknowledge m a k i n g 
i n f o rm a l payments t o p u b l i c o f f i c i a l s “to get things done” and 70.4 percent ind ica te that a 
t y p i c a l firm reports less than 100 percent o f sales f o r tax purposes. In order t o attract the 
mean ing fu l p r iva te inves tmen t that i s envisaged in i t s p o l i c y documents, these trends must be 
reversed. S ign i f ican t r e f o rm measures must be taken in order t o make Came roon a vas t ly mo re 
attractive investment oppo r tun i ty . 

33. Given a favorable inves tmen t climate, several areas o f the economy c o u l d boost 
competitiveness, i n c l u d i n g the u rban economy, agriculture, and mining. The u r b a n economy 
has been shown t o con t r ibu te g rea t ly t o economic g row th . F o r example, the con t r ibu t ion o f 
greater Doua la t o the coun t ry ’s GD P i s estimated at 60 percent, and the ove ra l l con t r ibu t ion o f 
the coun t ry ’s u rban i n f o rm a l economy i s estimated at one - th i rd o f GDP . T h o u g h possessing 
enormous potential, human c a p i t a l p roduc t ion , m o b i l i z a t i o n and accoun tab i l i ty are binding 
constraints t o economic g r ow t h in Came roon and demand imp rovemen t . The a g r i c u l t u r e sector 
too ho lds considerable potential, but faces impo r tan t constraints. Several va lue chains c o u l d 
develop i f structural constraints and weaknesses in ma rke t linkages are adequately addressed. 
These constraints inc lude p o o r in f ras t ruc tu re (production, marketing, transportation); 
l im i t e d 
con t ro l o f im p r o v e d p r o d u c t i o n techniques and poo r economic management s k i l l s ; weak 
inves tmen t capacity; l i m i t e d use o f im p r o v e d inputs; limited o rgan iza t ion o f producers, weak 
linkages t o markets and l i m i t e d development o f va lue -add ing ac t iv i t ies such as processing and 
warehousing. The m i n i n g sector also constitutes a v iab le source o f econom ic g row th . The 
coun t ry ’s m ine ra l resources inc lude n icke l , cobalt, i r o n ore, bauxite, diamonds, gold, limestone, 
ma rb le and uranium, among others. During the g loba l commod i ty p r ices boom, p r iva te sector 
in te res t in Cameroon’s geo log ica l po ten t ia l spiked and a number o f investors exp lo red various 
p ro jec ts in the country. Desp i te the recent commod i ty down tu rn , 
inves to r interest in 
Cameroon’s mining sector remains strong and n ew investments are l i k e l y t o come on l ine g iven 
favorable g loba l ma rke t cond i t ions .

G . Regional integration as a catalyst fo r growth 
35 . 
G iven Cameroon’s strategic geographic pos i t ion vis-a-vis i t s neighbors and the size and 
structure o f i t s economy, i t i s positioned to p lay a leading and catalytic role in fostering robust 
regional integration in central A f r ica . In particular, enormous potential exists for the promotion 
o f commercial relations in the framework o f the Communaute‘ Economique des Etats d ’AP ique 
Cen t ra le (CEAAC ) and the Communaute‘ Economique e t Mone‘taire de 1 ‘Afrique Cen t ra le 
(CEMAC), and reinforcing relations w i t h Nigeria. Strengthened regional integration could 
improve competitiveness and help member countries successfully attract investment and have 
better access to global markets. Closer integration wou ld also b r ing greater stability and 
reduced p r i c e vo la t i l i ty that was shown to be quite taxing on the ru ra l population in 2008. 
Important efforts have been undertaken to date to strengthen the customs union; to improve 
clearing procedures at the port o f Douala; and to facilitate transport along strategic transit axes 
to boost regional trade w i t h Chad and the Central A f r ican Republic. These economic 
integration efforts a re being strengthened in particular in the context o f the preparation o f the 
C EM AC Regional Economic Program wh ich aims at mak ing the sub-region an emerging 
integrated and competitive economic space. 

36. 
A ho l is t ic treatment o f the transport network that includes linkages between the road 
network and portshailways w i l l make tremendous inroads in promoting greater regional 
integration. This could include a stronger emphasis on the development o f concrete plans for 
the construction or rehabilitation o f se lec ted ports and railways, and a focus on po l icy reforms 
to facilitate trade across borders. Given i t s significant hydropower potential, Cameroon also has 
the potential to play a leading role in the development o f the Central A f r ican Power Pool 
(CAPP). To leverage this, interconnection agreements w i t h neighboring states remain to be 
signed, market r u l e s to be established, and capacity fo r regional coordination and planning to 
be built. Other areas where regional approaches can un lock additional g row th opportunities fo r 
Cameroon and on wh ich countries o f the sub-region are collaboratively wo rk ing on include 
in fo rma t ion and communications technology (ICT) and agriculture. 

111. Cameroon’s Vision f o r Growth and Development 
37. 
The Government o f Cameroon has an ambitious future planned, as r e f l e c t e d in i t s 
“V is ion 2035”. This po l icy document serves as the long-term anchor for the new PRSP, and 
envisions Cameroon as an “emerging nation, democratic and united in i t s diversity” b y 2035. 
I t s principle objectives include: (i) reducing poverty to l e s s than 10%; (ii) becoming a middle- 
income country; (iii) being an industrialized nation; and ( iv ) consolidating democracy and 
national unity. 

3 8 . 

The recently completed PRSP,” the G row th and Employment Strategy (Document de 
strate‘gie p o u r la croissance e t 1 ’emploi - DSCE) iden t i f ies weak productivity, a loom ing 
energy c r i s i s and e f f e c t s o f the financial crisis, food insecurity, stagnating poverty, and h i g h 
unemployment as key challenges facing the period in question (2009-2019). I t envisions 
significant investment in infrastructure t o stimulate growth, notably in energy, roads, port 
infrastructure, water supply, and information technology. Productive increases are sought in 
agriculture and livestock farming, m in ing (notably in bauxite, iron, and cobalt), key value 
chains (timber, ICT , tourism), and in the business climate. I t looks t o strengthen human 

I1 

The DSCE was approved by an Interministerial Committee on August 2 6 , 2 0 0 9 . 

13 

development and develop more robust fo rma l sector employment. The DSCE also places 
important emphasis on regional integration and envisions strengthened partnerships with non- 
traditional donors (BRICs plus Korea; the Islamic world). Finally, i t dedicates an en t i re chapter 
to 
imp rov ing governance, 
inc lud ing specific 
initiatives related to corruption, public 
procurement, business climate, and c iv ic participation. The new strategy aims to adjust the 
overall objectives and address the weaknesses o f the various policies inc lud ing covering some 
areas that had not been p r io r i t ized in the f i r s t round, inc lud ing energy, telecommunications, 
ru ra l development and governance. 

39. 
A draft Joint S t a f f Advisory No te (JSAN) underscores that the DSCE correctly 
iden t i f ies the country’s inadequate infrastructure and unfavorable bus iness environment as the 
main structural weaknesses hampering faster economic growth and employment. The JSAN 
also states the v iew that DSCE outlines a comprehensive framework fo r growth and 
employment in Cameroon. The document lays emphasis on infrastructure, rural development 
and governance to accelerate growth wh i le maintaining macroeconomic stability. I t also 
iden t i f ies that further wo rk i s needed to strengthen the implementation tools o f the strategy. 
P r io r i ty areas are: (i) strengthening the macroeconomic framework especially i t s medium-term 
fiscal framework and growth assumptions se t out in the strategy; (ii) strengthening the link 
between the DSCE, the M T E F and the annual budgets; (iii) deepening the strategy b y 
p r io r i t iz ing actions needed to accelerate pro-poor and private sector investment; ( iv ) ensuring 
the adequate resources for the medium to long-term objectives (infrastructures, ru ra l 
development and human, development), and (v) strengthening the implementation o f the 
Governance and Anti-corruption program. 

IV . The Bank Group Assistance Strategy 
40. 
The dialogue between the Wo r ld Bank and the Government o f Cameroon (GoC) i s at a 
c r i t ica l juncture. The Bank continues to be reminded o f austerity measures associated w i t h 
structural adjustment and the H IPC process in Cameroon, wh i le the government i s asserting 
i t s e l f in taking ownership over i t s economic future. The resulting dialogue at t imes p resen ts a 
paradox, whereby the Bank i s acknowledged as a strong, trusted partner behind closed doors, 
but in public i s often blamed fo r Cameroon’s economic malaise o f the last decade. S ince 
reaching the H IPC Completion Point in 2006, Cameroon has enjoyed substantial debt r e l i e f 
(US$1.15 b i l l i o n s ince 2000) f rom the HIPC, the MDRI and additional debt r e l i e f f rom the 
Paris Club creditors. However, these same institutions have noted a marked reduction in their 
po l icy leverage w i t h the government, as new overseas development assistance earmarked for 
Cameroon has stagnated wh i le government revenues, particularly f r om o i l , mushroomed. W i t h 
an annual budget o f approximately US $ 6 b i l l ion , the government’s resources dwa r f that 
available f rom traditional international assistance sources (approximately US$400 m i l l i o n o f 
commitments per annum, excluding debt re l ie f ) , 
including IDA ’S annualized allocation o f 
approximately US$IOO m i l l ion . Cameroon therefore finds i t s e l f w i t h substantially more f isca l 
space than in the past, thanks to a lower debt burden and i t s recen t w ind fa l l o i l revenues. 

41. 
As a result, the role o f the W o r l d Bank in helping Cameroon reach i t s objectives has 
evolved in to that o f a key advisor and a catalyst fo r attracting investors t o large projects. The 
Bank needs to demonstrate i t s analytical excellence as we l l as i t s leadership on complex 
operations in order to remain a key and trusted partner fo r Cameroon. The CAS outlines a 
selective se t o f engagements that lay the foundation to in f luence reform and progress in key 
14 

sectors. The CAS also incorporates important lessons, bo th f rom experience during the last 

CAS period, from the CAS consultations, and a recen t Client Survey. 

A. Implementation o f the last CAS and lessons learned 
42. 
A recently completed CAS Completion Report (CAS CR) covering the previous CAS 
( f rom 2003 to 2006) and the I S N for Fiscal Years 2007 and 2008, iden t i f ied several important 
lessons learned that have been taken in to account for the cu r ren t strategy. The CAS CR states 
that Cameroon’s uneven performance during the CAS period resu l ted in a slower than 
anticipated delivery o f new operations, making outcomes difficult to achieve. As r e f l e c t e d in 
deteriorating disbursement ratios, many o f the planned projects experienced delays in start up 
and implementation effectiveness during the ISN period, suggesting that actual contributions 
a re going to be f e l t mostly after the review period. A Client Survey has also greatly informed 
strategy preparation and the directions where the Bank w i l l engage d i f fe ren t ly and do more.

K e y lessons fo r the W o r l d Bank engagement in Cameroon include: 
Simpler project design to ensure a fit w i t h the government’s implementation capacity. 
Mo re flexible project designs may be appropriate in areas where the Bank has been 
largely absent from substantive po l icy dialogue over time. 
Bank teams should be attentive to the frequent disparity in commitment between the 
po l i t ica l and administrative levels. IEG reviews indicated the importance o f effective 
supervision and mon i to r ing and evaluation systems w i t h a recommendation to withdraw 
f rom certain projects i f considerable opposition and delay a re encountered. 
Though the previous CAS had a solid r e s u l t s orientation, many o f the envisaged outcomes 
too ambitious or 
the 
associated projects/activities were not 
undertaken during the CAS period. As 
a result, this CAS Results Framework

The Wo r ld Bank has aligned i t s Country Assistance Strategy w i t h the latest iteration o f 
the government’s poverty reduction strategy, the “Growth and Employment Strategy”. 
Ach iev ing this synergy, while responding to a challenging country context, necessitates that

ii. Strategic Theme One: Increasing Cameroon’s Competitiveness 
63. 
Vastly improved competitiveness underpins Cameroon’s intended g row th trajectory. As 
earlier referenced, despite great potential in many industries (e.g. mining, timber, agribusiness, 
tourism and ICT), Cameroon’s exports continue to be 
dominated b y o i l . The 
reasons 
fo r 
this 
underperformance are essentially related to poor 
in f ras t ruc tu re (in particular energy, transport and 
telecommunications) and a poor investment climate. 
Cameroon’s DSCE envisions major state-led 
investment in large public works activities, both to 
accelerate growth and to provide a needed fiscal 
stimulus during the financial c r i s i s . As such, Wo r ld 
Bank support to improve competitiveness w i l l focus 
on th ree principal axes: (i) increased infrastructure 
investment 
energy, 
transport, 
and 
telecommunications sectors; (ii) activities geared 
toward ensuring the transparent, equitable, and 
sustainable use o f natural resources, 
inc lud ing 
mining, agriculture, f ishe r ies , and protected areas; 
and (iii) Gomo t ion o f h igh potential value chains and improved business c l ima te . Given the 
role i t plays in strengthening competitiveness, regional integration i s an important part o f this 
strategic theme (see B o x 4).

outlined in Section I Ic , the energy sector constitutes one o f the greatest b ind ing constraints to 
growth in Cameroon. Current W o r l d Bank engagement in the sector includes the Energy Sector

2. Better access and quality o f health services 
83 . 
Health. W o r l d Bank support in the hea l th sector seeks t o address b ind ing constraints to 
better s e r v i c e delivery through increases in u t i l iza t ion and improvements in the quality o f 
health services, w i t h a particular focus on child and maternal health and communicable 
diseases. The ongoing Health Sector Support Project targets district level activities, p rov id ing 
financial resources and a performance-based incentive system to boost outcomes. The project 
focuses on gender aspects o f poverty b y seeking to reduce Cameroon’s frighteningly poor 
health outcomes for women. The project also puts a strong emphasis on sector s t a f f being held 
accountable for resu l ts , ensuring the f l ow o f funds to health facilities takes place in a t ime ly 
manner, where r e s u l t s are measured and remunerated. The project i s also expected to help 
strengthen the health in fo rma t ion system and generate new credible data. The availability o f 
better in fo rma t ion w i l l provide the opportunity to more thoroughly analyze the health sector 
and engage in better-informed po l icy dialogue. Undertaken in parallel w i t h sector support f rom 
Germany and France, the project i s expected to last the duration o f the CAS period. A health 
28 

country status report w i l l be prepared in F Y 1 1, and w i l l help guide future interventions in the 
sector. 

3. G r e a t e r access to bas ic i n f r a s t r u c t u r e and soc ia l sa fe ty ne ts 
84. 

As earlier outlined, deepened decentralization l i e s at the heart o f the government’s 
recent po l icy prescriptions, inc lud ing the announcement o f intergovernmental f i s c a l transfers to 
local governments in 2010. This shift p resen ts bo th an opportunity and a tremendous challenge 
to these local governments, who lack the requisite s k i l l s and experience to select and supe rv ise 
efficient high-quality investments. A long similar l ines , measures taken to date b y the 
government to respond to the impact o f exogenous shocks on the population have not been well 
targeted to those most affected. As poverty rates stagnate and the overall number o f poor 
increases, particularly in the no r th o f the country, there i s a real need t o identify safety ne t 
activities that could rec t i fy this wo r ry ing trend. 

8 5 . 

Loca l Development and Basic Infrastructure. The Na t iona l Community Development 
Program, an A P L whose second phase was recently approved b y the W o r l d Bank Board o f 
Directors, i s one o f the institution’s two key entry points to improve local development 
activities. Financed in partnership w i t h Germany and France, the program seeks to improve the 
delivery o f spec i f ied basic social services (health, education, water and sanitation) in targeted 
local governments, and extend the ongoing process in support to decentralization to new 
regions. This program’s third and f ina l phase w i l l be financed late in the CAS period. 

86. 

The second entry po in t i s the ongoing U rban and Water Development Project (PDUE), 
wh ich also supports local development, albeit in urban areas. The project i s wo rk ing to increase 
access o f the urban population, particularly those l i v i n g in low-income se t t lemen ts , to basic 
infrastructure and se rv ices , 
inc lud ing water. I t works intensively w i t h f ive municipalities 
(Bamenda, Douala, Maroua, Mbalmayo, and Yaounde) in order to build their administrations’ 
capacity to plan, implement, and maintain small infrastructure works (p r ima r i ly roads and 
drainage), as we l l as construction or repair o f social facilities (such as classrooms or health 
centers) in a transparent and sustainable manner. Crisis Response W indow resources w i l l be 
used in F Y 20 10 to provide additional financing fo r critical urban infrastructure investments. 

87 . 

A proposed U rban Sanitation Project w i l l seek to increase and improve access to 
sanitation, p r ima r i ly in low-income neighborhoods o f the ma in cities o f Cameroon. The project 
w i l l include capacity bu i ld ing and institutional strengthening, infrastructure work, and 
vocational training, hygiene education, and sanitation promotion. The potential partners in the 
project include the A f r ican Development Bank, France, the European Union, and Korea. 
Analytic support i s currently being provided to the municipality o f Douala to prepare a C i t y 
Development Strategy (CDS), wh ich w i l l provide an important foundation for mun ic ipa l 
investments in basic services and infrastructure. Du r ing the CAS period, support w i l l be 
provided to the mun ic ipa l i ty o f Yaounde to also develop a CDS. 

88 . 

Safety Nets. An extensive review o f existing safety net programs w i l l be undertaken in 
early in the CAS period. I t w i l l provide a p la t fo rm for po l icy dialogue w i t h the government 
regarding the possibility o f using targeted transfer programs to the most poor and vulnerable to 
reduce poverty and protect them f r om the potential effects o f the global financial c r i s i s . This 
review w i l l also examine gender-sensitive options fo r these targeted activities, in l igh t o f the 
29 

important ro le women play in ensuring welfare at household level. This analytic wo rk w i l l also 
investigate the current functioning o f the social security system in general and o f the safety n e t s 
system in Cameroon in particular. I t i s expected that the government w i l l improve the 
effectiveness and monitoring o f the safety n e t system b y adjusting existing programs and 
p i lo t ing new programs. In support o f this, a new project la te in the CAS pe r iod wou ld provide 
the necessary support and resources to the government t o achieve this goal. The ma in objective 
o f the project wou ld be to strengthen the social safety nets system and to se t up permanent 
programs that can provide income support to chronic and transitory poor to be used in regular 
times and to respond to cr ises , such as direct transfer or a public works program, fo l low ing the 
recommendations o f the analytic work. 

V. Program delivery, monitoring, and management 
89. 
Program Delivery. Though Cameroon i s classified as a lowe r middle-income country, i t 
w i l l remain IDA eligible fo r the CAS period. Cameroon’s 2008 GN I per capita was US$1150, 
just above the operational IDA cu t -o f f po in t o f US$1135. I f Cameroon exceeds the cu t -o f f 
point in 2009, i t wou ld become a gap country in F Y 2012 and receive IDA assistance on 
hardened t e r m s (20 years maturity and 10 years grace). Though Cameroon’s economic outlook 
i s expected to remain favorable in the coming t h r e e years, the country i s un l ike ly to be eligible 
for IBRD lending so long as: (i) i t i s under an IMF program that precludes any recourse to non- 
concessional lending13, and (ii) i t has no t established a sustained and credible track record o f 
economic performance. U p o n achieving these milestones, a formal assessment o f Cameroon’s 
creditworthiness for IBRD lending w i l l be carried out.I4 Such assessment i s based on an 
analysis o f eight creditworthiness components (political risk, external debt and l iqu id i ty , fiscal 
po l icy and public debt burden, balance o f payment risks, economic s t ruc tu re and growth 
prospects, monetary and exchange rate policy, financial sector r isks , and corporate sector debt 
and vulnerabilities). 

90. 
Total I D A resource availability to Cameroon during the CAS pe r iod f r om FY2010 to 
FY2013 i s estimated at approximately US$430 m i l l ion . Cameroon’s FY2010 allocation i s 
US$130 million (including US$29.7 m i l l i o n in additional resources made available through a 
p i lo t I D A Crisis Response Window), and i t s FY2011 to 2013 a l loca t ion in i s estimated at about 
US$lOO m i l l i o n per year. The FY11-13 allocations a re indicative on ly and can change 
depending on: (i) total available IDA resources; (ii) the country’s performance rating; (iii) the 
performance and assistance t e rm s o f other I D A borrowers; (iv) the t e rm s o f IDA ’S assistance to 
Cameroon (grants or credits); and (v) the number o f IDA -e l ig ib le countries. FY 1 2 and FY13 
indicative allocations assume a similar level o f replenishment in I D A 1 6 as in IDA 1 5 . Should 
additional I D A resources materialize during the CAS period, this wou ld be used to scale-up the 
amounts allocated to the pipeline o f planned investments rather than necessitating the 
development o f new ones. 

91. 
Program Mon i to r ing . The CAS includes a strong focus on managing fo r development 
resu l ts . CAS outcomes a re based on a holistic v iew o f development, incorporating the concept 
o f strong interdependencies between different interventions and outcomes, and acknowledging 

13 

Cameroon completed its Fourth PRGF in Ap r i l 2009 , and w i l l consider a new IM F program in the coming 
months. 
I 4 IBRD borrower’s creditworthiness i s defined as the country’s ability and willingness to repay IBRD on time and 
in full. Middle-income countries qualify for borrowing from IBRD based on this creditworthiness.

cross-sectoral synergies that in f luence CAS contributions. D raw ing upon the experience o f the 
last CAS, the r e s u l t s framework (see Annex 2 ) has been carefully structured to incorporate the 
most relevant and effective indicators fo r mon i to r ing progress f r om bo th ongoing and planned 
activities during the CAS period. G iven that a l l indicators are taken f rom those that are 
currently tracked in Implementation Status and Results Reports (ISRs) o f projects in the 
portfolio, CAS r e s u l t s monitoring w i l l be strengthened w i t h the increased attention that i s being 
placed on ISR quality. In addition, these indicators w i l l be tracked in real time, using the CAS 
monitoring too l that was recently developed b y the Operations Po l icy and Country s e r v i c e s 
Department. The CAS resu l ts framework w i l l also be adjusted as and when projects are 
formally restructured to r e f l e c t any formal changes in those project indictors that are also 
included in the CAS r e s u l t s framework. Changes to the CAS r e s u l t s framework w i l l be 
compiled in to the CAS Progress Report and the CAS Completion Report. 

92 . 
P rog ram management. The quarterly CAS progress reports w i l l also be shared w i t h the 
government, and w i l l be d iscussed in depth during Country Po r t fo l io Performance Reviews 
(CPPRs). Country management w i l l continue i t s recen t practice o f sending mon th ly monitoring 
tables to the Country Team and the government, in order to iden t i fy bo th areas o f progress and 
prospective risk. To promote transparency in r e s u l t s and r e s u l t s monitoring, i t i s intended that 
intermediary and f ina l results f rom Bank financed interventions w i l l be made available to the 
public b y publishing these mon th ly po r t fo l io snapshots on the Cameroon country o f f ice 
website. The Wo r ld Bank w i l l also continue decentralizing senior international staff to the 
country o f f ice in order to ensure a more sustained sector dialogue and stronger attention to 
development outcomes. CPPRs w i l l continue to be held on a bi-annual basis, and w i l l not on ly 
identify and address cross-cutting challenges to the portfolio, but also b r ing in outside experts 
to c r i t i c a l l y examine specific projects that are either already at risk, or that have demonstrated 
recen t diminished performance, as demonstrated by a lowered ra t ing o f e i the r Implementation 
Progress or progress toward achieving the Project Development Objective. Based on these 
analyses at bo th levels, the Country Management Unit w i l l continue to facilitate training 
seminars with project units that specifically respond to identified weaknesses, as has been the 
case in the past w i t h annual wo rk programming, procurement, and disbursement reques t 
processing.

C A S consultations themselves consisted o f several meetings and workshops over 
several mon ths . The most in tens ive period was during a week in M a y 2009 , when e igh t

conducted with the I F C in Doua la t o seek input f r o m the p r iva te sector. The C l i e n t Survey was 
f ie lded in M a r c h 2009 , and inc luded responses f r o m a to ta l o f 258 stakeholders, d r aw n f rom 
d i f fe ren t organizations and sectors. The questionnaire identified ove ra l l attitudes t ow a r d the 
Bank , the impo r tance o f spec i f ic areas o f the Bank’s w o r k and the Bank ’s effectiveness in those 
areas, and the i r l e v e l o f agreement with a s e r i e s o f statements about the w a y the W o r l d B a n k

The f rag i le g loba l economy, coup led with a cha l leng ing coun t ry context, present several

pa t te rn o f behav io r w i l l be repeated in the nex t CAS , t rans la t ing i n t o comp rom ised 
development effectiveness and sustained ine r t ia related t o inc lus ive g row th . M i t i g a t i n g 
this risk calls f o r deve lop ing p ro jec ts where the re i s strong p o l i t i c a l will, and con t inu ing 
t o strengthen the B a n k G roup ’s p o l i c y dialogue at a l l leve ls o f government, i n c l u d i n g 
with the Execu t ive . 
- Repu ta t iona l Risks. Ce r ta in investments, mos t no tab ly the Lom Pangar Hyd ropowe r 
Project, pose s ign i f ican t repu ta t iona l risks t o the W o r l d Bank. Taking lessons learned 
from projects such as the Chad Came roon p ipe l ine o n board, the W o r l d B a n k has 
already started t o build GoC ’s capacity t o prepare the L P H P acco rd ing t o best p rac t ice 
standards, and already has in place a pa ra l le l env i ronmen ta l and soc ia l capacity building 
p ro jec t and fo res t ry and env i ronmen t p ro tec t ion p rog ram . Repu ta t iona l risks are also 
present with respect t o the governance agenda, where a fa i lu re o f the W o r l d B a n k t o 
de l ive r these ac t iv i t ies w o u l d lead t o an unacceptable pe rpe tua t ion o f the status quo. 
Adequate human and f inanc ia l resources w i l l therefore need to be deployed f o r these 
e f fo r ts . 
- F i d u c i a r y Risks. F r o m a f i d u c i a r y perspective, Came roon i s a high-risk environment, as 
the C A S c lea r ly demonstrates. T o m i t iga te this, the B a n k w i l l con t inue and deepen i t s 
aggressive, p rac t ica l in te rven t ions t o ensure f iduc ia ry integrity o f IDA operations; w i l l 
help strengthen the government’s f iduc ia ry risk management; w i l l design operations 
that reduce oppo r tun i t ies f o r co r rup t ion ; and w i l l seek t o change the incen t ives fac ing 
government counterparts by emphas iz ing the importance o f r e s u l t s and the Bank’s zero 
tolerance fo r co r rup t ion . 
- P o l i t i c a l Economy R isks . At the p o l i t i c a l leve l , Came roon i s considered as a stable

I. Introduction 
1. 
This Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report (CASCR) assesses the 
effectiveness o f the FY04-06 W o r l d Bank Group Country Ass is tance Strategy (CAS) fo r 
Cameroon (Report N o . 26555, dated August 2003) and the subsequent Interim Strategy Report 
( ISN ) , (Report N o . 37897-CM, dated November 9,2006). I t i s based upon reviews o f (a) 
po r t fo l io implementation performance reports; (b) most recen t Implementation Status and 
Results Reports (ISRs) and Aide-Memoires o f each project active during the respective periods, 
(c) Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs) o f projects completed during the period, 
Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) Reviews o f ICRs, and Qua l i ty Assurance Group (QAG) 
Reviews, where available; (d) interviews w i t h selected c l i e n t counterparts; and (e) s e l f - 
assessments by the Country Team. The findings f rom this assessment have in fo rmed the 
preparation o f the FY 1 0 -FY 13 Country Assistance Strategy. 

2. 
Du r ing the course o f FY04 -06 CAS period, significant changes occurred in Cameroon's 
development context. These changes included Cameroon's attainment o f the completion po in t 
under the Heav i ly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) In i t ia t ive in April 200617. In addition, 
Cameroon also became eligible to receive additional assistance f rom the Mu l t i la te ra l Debt 
Re l ie f In i t ia t ive (MDRI) and f rom o f f ic ia l bilateral creditors belonging to the Paris Club Group. 
Bo th marked a significant shift in the relationship between the Government and i t s international 
partners and provided Cameroon w i t h an opportunity to accelerate development, to get back on 
track to reach i t s Millennium Development Goals and to tackle the h i g h prevalence o f 
corruption. A l l o f these changes resulted in the Government's decision to start to revise i t s 
PRSP, w i t h an original expected completion date o f early 2008. 
3 . 
Against this backdrop, and in order to ensu re that the Bank's next CAS wou ld be f u l l y 
aligned, an ISN was prepared to extend the CAS for FY07-08, and wh ich reflected consultation 
w i t h the Government, other stakeholders and international partners. At the end o f the CAS 
period, in i t ia l h igh leve l conclusions regarding the effectiveness o f Bank contributions were 
presented in the I S N (and have been incorporated w i th in this document). I t was agreed that a 
comprehensive evaluation o f progress in achieving CAS outcomes wou ld be conducted at the 

I 7 A t the decision point, Cameroon was expected to reach completion point i n Ap r i l 2003, but i t was only un t i l 2005 
after the macroeconomic framework were strengthened and progress in PRSP implementation and governance 
measures were sustained that Cameroon was able to reach the completion point in Apr i l 2006, after f id f i l l ing a l l 
agreed conditions.

4. 
Finalized in 2003, the strategic framework o f the f i r s t Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper 
(PRSP) rested upon seven pillars: (i) promoting a stable macroeconomic framework; (ii) 
strengthening g row th through economic diversification; (iii) empowering the private sector as 
the ma in engine o f growth and as a partner in social service delivery; (iv) developing basic 
in f ras t ruc tu re and natural resources in an environmentally sustainable manner; (v) accelerating 
regional integration within the Economic and Monetary Community o f Central A f r ica 
framework (CEMAC , Communaute Economique et MonCtaire d'Afrique Central); (vi) 
strengthening human resources, bolstering the social sectors, and promoting the integration o f 
vulnerable groups in the economy; and (v i i ) imp rov ing the institutional framework, 
administrative management, and governance. 

5 . 
Fo l low ing a slow start, the 2005 progress report o f the PRSP highlighted progress in 
several areas, inc lud ing diversification o f the economy and the g row th in non -o i l revenues, the 
preparation o f Med ium -Te rm Expenditure Frameworks (MTEFs) based on sector strategies in 
p r io r i ty sectors, and better alignment o f annual budget allocations w i t h PRSP priorities. D e s p i t e 
this improvement, economic growth during the period o f CAS implementation f e l l short o f 
expectations and PRSP target growth rates. 

6. 
Cameroon continues to lag w i t h respect to achieving the Millennium Development Goals 
(MDGs), wh ich underscores the d i f f icu l ty in gearing public po l icy toward a focused e f fo r t at 
ensuring that the poorest benefit f rom the country's modest growth. On ly two MDGs'' are 
w i th in reach b y 201 5 , but on ly i f reforms are sustained. Indicators relating to gender equality 
and women's empowerment, maternal mortality, ch i ld health and reduction o f malaria and other 
major disease inc idence w i l l not be met. Finally, the goal that seeks to halve the population 
l i v i n g below the poverty line i s also un l ike ly to be met. 

7. 
Completion o f the second PRSP was delayed considerably for various reasons, inc lud ing 
the decision b y the Government to undertake a longer t e r m strategic analysis and v is ion 
stretching to 2035. At the time o f writing, many o f the outstanding actions have now been 
completed and the PRSP has just been finalized.

B a n k S t ra teg ic Ob jec t ives and CAS Ou tcomes 
8 . 
The FY04-06 CAS was one o f the f i r s t resu l ts CASs to be developed in the Bank. I t was 
we l l aligned t o the agenda detailed in the country's PRSP and presented to the Board in July 
2003. I t was aimed at supporting the goal o f reducing poverty b y imp rov ing basic service 
delivery and spurring private sector-led growth, underpinned b y better governance. 
9 . 
These two p i l la rs o f the CAS remained va l id in the I S N for FY07-08. There was, 
however, a need fo r adjustments, to r e f l e c t the country's changing development context, the 
Wo r ld Bank's A f r ica Action Plan (AAP), lessons learnt arising f rom consultations w i t h the 
Government and other partners, including a c l i e n t survey and other analysis e.g., a Q A G

water (environmental sustainability)

assessment o f ESW. A l l o f this was embodied in th ree guiding principles fo r W o r l d Bank Group 
support, namely: (i) to s tep up e f f o r t s to address governance, notably b y reducing corruption; 
(ii) to strengthen partnership, alignment, and harmonization; and (iii) to strengthen management 
fo r results, based on a mod i f ied I S N resu l ts framework organized around six outcome clusters. 
To further foster the Bank Group's management fo r resu l ts , the Bank's country o f f ice was also 
strengthened, inc lud ing through the decentralization o f some international staff. 
The resu l ts assessment o f the CAS FY04 -06 / ISN FY07-08 i s presented according to the 
s t ruc tu re o f the I S N resu l ts matrix. As described above, this was reorganized around six 
outcome clusters, designed to create stronger cross-sector linkages, greater operational cohesion 
across the Bank Group, as we l l as to improve the effectiveness o f activities w i t h other partners. 
Due to the b rev i ty o f the two year period, a decision was taken b y the new ly appointed Country 
Director not to appoint outcome c lus te r leaders, nor to implement the Development 
Effectiveness Scorecard. Instead, r e s u l t s o f the program were assessed regularly, particularly 
during Country Po r t fo l io Program Reviews (CPPRs). 

1 1. 
Based upon the two p i l la rs o f strengthening the institutional framework for pro-poor 
economic management and service delivery, as w e l l as reducing se lec ted constraints to, and 
directly supporting private sector development, the six outcome c lus te rs consisted o f the 
fo l low ing :

i. Strengthening PRSP implementation

13 . 

Moderate progress was made b y the Bank during the I S N period towards supporting this 
outcome. Nevertheless, the Bank provided some c r i t ica l ground wo rk towards the end o f the 
CAS period wh ich positively influenced the PRSP process, particularly in re la t ion to the 
establishment o f a PRSP-centered dialogue p la t fo rm between the Government and i t s 
stakeholders. 

14. 
Significant activities during the CAS period included a Poverty Assessment (FY05) and a 
Development Policy Review (both the original report that was delivered in FY 0 4 and a later 
update) both designed to support the revision and implementation o f the PRSP. In a review 
undertaken b y QAG, the Development Policy Review, delivered in 2004, was judged t o be an 
"outstanding report" and rated h igh ly satisfactory. W i t h regards to the l i k e l y impact, the report 
was considered to provide an important contribution towards the f i r s t PRSC, the IMF PRGF, the 
PRSP, other IDA - f inanced operations in forestry, capacity bu i ld ing and other sectors and also 
the new CAS. The Poverty Assessmen t , delivered in 2005, was also rated as h igh ly satisfactory 
b y QAG, particularly in t e rm s o f i t s l ike ly impact. Joint efforts between the Government and the 
Bank team were considered to be bes t practice. The Assessment was expected to provide an 
important contribution towards updating the PRSP as we l l as guiding public expenditure 
decisions through the MTEF . 

15. 
Bank support provided to the Government towards attainment o f the H IPC Completion 
Point also provided c r i t ica l ground wo rk in revising the PRSP. For example, the Debt R e l i e f 
Grant Under the Enhanced H IPC Initiative, completed in December 2006, was a h igh ly 
innovative operation and on ly the second o f i t s type to be carried out (i.e. debt r e l i e f on IBRD 
debt). The operation was rated satisfactory w i t h considerable impact. Albeit the H IPC 
completion point was achieved th ree years later than planned, the country's debt sustainability 
improved as a result o f the grant and CP IA ratings for Quality o f Budgeting and Financial 
Management improved s ince 2001. Other bene f i ts related to improvements in H IPC tracking 
indicators (e.g., improved budget classification). 

16. 
The revision o f the PRSP b y the Government was influenced b y consultations which 
highlighted increased public demand for more government ownership, transparency and 
responsiveness. Participatory consultations (across a l l ten departments o f the country) as we l l as 
outreach to c i v i l society representatives were launched b y the M in is t ry o f Economy, Planning 
and Territorial Administration (M INEPAT ) in Ma rch 2008 to take stock o f resu l ts f rom PRS I 
implementation and to incorporate stakeholder recommendations for geographical and sector 
targeting. I t i s estimated that some 6,000 people were consulted, representing a labor-intensive 
undertaking for the authorities. 

59 

17. 
The consultations also con f i rmed the m a j o r sho r tcom ing o f PRS I imp lemen ta t ion 
i n c l u d i n g the dearth o f quan t i f iab le ind ica to rs and measurable outcomes. This was la rge ly due 
to (i) the absence o f baseline i n f o rm a t i o n o n pe r fo rmance leve ls and service standards at PRS I

For the Government o f Cameroon, attainment o f the H IPC Completion Point represented 
a "starting po in t " fo r renewed e f fo r t to f igh t corruption and strengthen transparency and 
accountability in the management o f public resources. Strengthening o f public financial 
management was a c r i t ica l e lemen t o f the 2006-20 10 National Governance Program, 
particularly given the significant increase in resources as a r e s u l t o f debt r e l i e f . 
20. 
Du r ing the CAS / ISN period, modest progress was made b y the Bank in achieving i t s 
respective outcomes, namely to ensure that the Government exhibits greater transparency and 
accountability in mobilization and use o f pub l ic resources and that Management and resource 
f lows in key line ministries improved. At the end o f the CAS period, i t was noted that 8 o f 16 
indicators o f the quality o f public expenditure management were met, a slight improvement 
over the CAS base l ine o f 7 o f 1 5 .19 In two ministries (health and public works) substantial 
progress was made in preparing sector strategies and MTEFs as the basis fo r the annual budget. 
A more detailed summary o f progress made du r ing the CAS period, in particular in four areas o f 
pub l ic management i s provided be low as w e l l as outstanding key challenges for the I S N pe r iod 
(s,ee I S N page 17). 

19 

Since the publication o f the FY04-06 CAS, an indicator on procurement was added, bringing the number o f 
indicators to 16. Cameroon had satisfactory ratings in only 4 o f 15 areas in the 2001 baseline.

(a) L ink ing the budget to PRSP through the Progress made during the CAS FY04-06 
period 

Progress made during the CAS FY04-06 
weriod 
Budget allocations to PRSP priorities, 
particularly education, health and 
infrastructure, have progressively 
increased. 
A global MTEF , as w e l l as sector MTEFs 
and strategies in education, health, rural 
development, pub l ic works, jus t ice , and 
social development, have been developed 
and are contributing to the preparation o f 
the 2007 budget. 
The budget has become more 
comprehensive, w i t h the road fund and 
spending previously financed directly 
through the national o i l company now 
included in the budget. 
A new, common nomenclature for 
budgeting and accounting has been 
adopted. 

(b) Budget execution and control 

Progress made during the CAS FY04-06 
period 

Improvements in budget execution and 
control include computerization o f 
budget transactions and treasury 
systems, closure o f most government 
accounts held at commercial banks, 
significant reduction in the use o f 

spec ia l procedures that bypass the 

expenditure chain, regular payment b y 
the Government o f pub l ic u t i l i t y bills, 
monitoring o f the f inances o f public 
en te rp r ises , and payment o f domestic 
debt and arrears based on a multiyear 
payment plan. 

Key challenges during ISN FYO7-08 period 

F u l l adoption o f the M T E F approach, 
emphasizing decentralized budget 
planning and costing, resu l ts orientation 
and monitoring, and better coordination. 
Creation o f fiscal space t o raise public 
investment expenditures f rom l e s s than 2 
percent in recen t years to 4-5 percent in 
the medium te rm , as envisaged in the 
PRSP. 
Adop t ion and implementation o f the new 
organic budget law currently under 
preparation w i l l facilitate implementation 

o f the MTEF approach. 

Strengthening partnerships between the 
Government and international partners in 
order to ensure alignment o f external 
resources to the PRSP through the MTEFs 
and the budget. 

Key challenges during ISN FYO7-08period 

Internal budget control systems remain 
weak. Key improvements required include 
making l i n e ministries responsible and 
accountable for managing expenditures, 
c la r i fy ing the mandates o f the various 
control units, and addressing problems in 
the transition to computerized systems. 
Management and control o f personnel and 
pay ro l l needs to be substantially 
strengthened, b y completing the census to 
cleanse the payroll, ensuring that 
employment o f contract workers i s

I. 

Progress during the I S N FYO7-OS period 
21, Mos t o f the key challenges identified du r ing the ISN period are s t i l l relevant today; two 
o f the milestones were no t met and two were met partially. W i t h regards to strengthening and 
increasing transparency in public financial management, inc lud ing procurement, relevant bank 
support was incorporated w i th in the IDA - f inanced Transparency and Accountability Capacity 
Development project (TACD). A project component emphasized the need for more 
transparency o f public accounts and sharpening the focus on accountability and oversight b y the 
Na t iona l Assembly and the c i v i l society. I t was also designed to complement the wo rk led b y 
the European Union, v ia the j o i n t public financial management platform, to strengthen the 
new ly established Chamber o f Accounts. Fo l low ing extensive preparation delay (5 years), the 
T A C D project became effective in June 2009, after completion o f the I S N period. Wo rk i s 
currently underway to focus on beneficiary and stakeholder commitment and to ensure proper 

implementation and r e s u l t s a re achieved. 

22. 
The delay in the project preparation hampered the Bank's ab i l i ty to contribute f u l l y 
towards the achievement o f the milestones as articulated in the resu l ts matrix o f the ISN. For 
example, the central government financial statements o f 2004 and 2005 have just been prepared, 
la te r than the proposed 2006 and 2007 deadlines and the Chamber o f Accounts i s yet to audit 
the 2005 statements. Procurement audits have been also conducted on annual basis, but r e s u l t s 
are not published. The milestone relating to the integration o f the M T E F in the preparation o f 
the 2008 budget was not met; this was prepared using existing budget procedures that do not 
a l low fo r a meaningful integration o f PRSP priorities and without a multiyear perspective. S t i l l , 
the Na t iona l Assembly adopted in December 2006, a new budget and financial framework that 
w i l l a l low fo r multiyear budgeting and se ts the implementing calendar for the 2013 budget. 
23. 
Significant AAA support was provided b y the Bank during the CAS / ISN period. This 
included continuation o f the po l icy dialogue and technical assistance, outreach and 
dissemination o f key pieces o f analytical wo rk completed in FY06, and analysis o f emerging 
issues , inc lud ing the anticormption agenda. The CPAR follow-up, delivered as additional A A A 
in FY06, was rated as satisfactory in t e rm s o f meeting i t s l i k e l y impact b y QAG . As mentioned 
above, the Development Policy Review o f 2004, rated b y Q A G review as h igh ly satisfactory, 
also had a significant impact in t e rm s o f the public finance re fo rm agenda and resulted in 
stronger linkages between sector programs and the MTEF . The FY07-08 wo rk program focused 
on sector dialogue and knowledge generation on governance. Examples o f activities included 
coordinated anti -corruption support w i t h other development partners, dissemination o f the 
Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review (as part o f the multi- 
donor public financial management platform) and support to the implementation o f the 
Extractive Industries Transparency In i t ia t ive (E IT I ) . To date, partial progress has been made b y 
the Bank under the Extractive Industries Transparency In i t ia t ive (EITI), with particular focus on 
increased transparency in o i l revenues; E IT I conciliator reports o f 200 1-2004 and o f 2005 were 
disseminated respectively in 2006 and 2007. The E I T I reports o f 2006 and 2007 are currently 
under preparation.

24. As noted in the I S N (p 20), CAS interventions in FY04-06 to relax constraints and reduce 
the costs to the private sector showed l i t t l e progress. In the ISN , the Bank planned to step up i t s 
support in f ive areas as well as to address in-country staffing constraints. The f ive p r io r i ty areas 
included (i) helping improve the business environment, inc lud ing through support to se t up a 
public-private dialogue mechanism for mechanism for addressing p r io r i ty reforms in l i n e w i t h 
the resu l ts o f the Investment Climate Assessment, the ROSC, and D o i n g Bus iness surveys, (ii) 
supporting public en te rp r ise reforms, bu i ld ing on global expertise, inc lud ing private-public 
partnerships, (iii) supporting small and medium-size en terpr ises , notably b y continuing IFC 
support to the business advisory s e r v i c e s provided b y the private sector umbrella organization 
G I C A M (Groupement Inter-patronal du Cameroun, Cameroon Employers Group); promoting 
leasing, through regulatory change; supporting m ic ro finance; and l ink ing small and medium- 
size en te rp r ise supply chains to large investments, such as AES Sonel, (iv) financing IFC direct 
investments and advisory services in infrastructure, financial markets, forestry, and general 
manufacturing and s e r v i c e s and (v) supporting reforms and initiatives that improve access to 
financial services, p r ima r i ly b y p rov id ing assistance to regional markets and institutions in the 
financial sector. 

In sp i te o f these efforts, during the I S N period, l i t t l e progress was made in achieving the 

25. 
outcomes and milestones in this cluster. Cameroon continues to make very slow progress w i t h 
respect t o i t s indicators relating to starting a new business. The second I S N milestone, namely 
to increase Cameroon's ranking in the 2008 Do ing Bus iness survey was not met; Cameroon's 
ranking in the 2008 survey improved b y one position compared to the 2007 survey ( f rom 161 to 
160). Du r ing this time, Cameroon managed to reduce both the time and cost to start a business 
f rom 44 in 2005 to 37 days in 2007, and also f rom 157.4 percent o f GNI per capital to 129.2 
percent respectively but no changes have been recorded in t e r m s o f reducing the number o f 
procedures, inc lud ing obtaining licenses t o start a bus iness . 

26. 
E f fo r ts to develop an effective public-private sector dialogue structure and to convene a 
first bus iness investment fo rum b y June 2007 were supported b y the j o i n t Bank's Pub l idp r iva te 
Partnership for G row th and Poverty Reduction Project (PPPGRP). Wh i le some progress was 
made, the project was deemed to be unsatisfactory b y I E G w i t h a weak project design and 
inadequate mon i to r ing and evaluation procedures to permit a meaningful assessment o f 
progress. Good achievements were noted in financial sector wo rk on m ic ro finance and in 
imp rov ing the efficacy o f Dou la Port, but the re fo rm o f postal savings and social security was 
also limited b y a lack o f government commitment. The project supported the establishment and 
early years o f operation o f the Competitiveness Committee. The Committee gained some 
importance w i t h the Government's increased in te res t in supporting h i g h potential value chains 
and in introducing investment c l ima te re fo rms along these value chains. The Committee acts as 
a think tank to the Government on competitiveness i s s u e s . 

27. 
CAS outcomes relating to reducing delays in payment clearing and process in Bank to 
Bank and to Client to client transactions were met. This was largely as a resu l t o f support 
provided b y the Bank's regional project, B E AC regional payment system, (Banque des etats de 
1'Afrique Centrale), which was aimed at imp rov ing the efficiency and security o f the payment 
system in the Central A f r ican Economic and Monetary Un ion . The ICR report i s s t i l l under 
preparation, but the last ISR reports that a l l p ro jec t development objectives have been e i the r met 

66 

or exceeded: significant reduction o f delays were recorded in payment clearing and se t t lemen t 
and se t t lemen t o f large value transactions in real time. 
28 . A f te r considerable delay, the C EM AC Regional Institutions Support Project was 
approved b y the Board in December 2008, and became effective six months later in A p r i l 2009 . 
The project aims to strengthen Central A f r ican regional institutions so that they can fulfill their 
mandates to encourage an expanded, better governed regional market, and a more transparent, 
better regulated and more competitive f inanc ia l system. The project i s currently experiencing 
delays in implementation and effectiveness. 
29 . 
W i t h respec t to lessons learnt, the IEG review o f the PPPGRP indicated the importance 
o f e f f e c t i v e supervision and mon i to r ing and evaluation systems. Close attention needs to be pa id 
to po l i t ica l economy and the Bank should withdraw i f considerable opposition and delay are 
encountered. 

11. 

IFC financing and advisory support 

30. 
IFC ’s strategy for Cameroon included: i) support to the infrastructure sector, in particular 
the power generation segment; (ii) enhanced financial and technical support to the SME sector, 
through l o c a l f inanc ia l in termed iar ies ; (iii) improvement o f the country’s investment climate 
and reduction in the cost o f doing bus iness ; and (iv) identification o f areas suitable for j o i n t 
ID A / I FC initiatives to maximize W B G impact using sector studies and mapping. IFC delivered 
significant new investments during the CAS implementation period. The flagship investment 
was a US$90 million-equivalent investment in AES Sonel, the privatized power u t i l i ty , IFC’s 
single largest investment in Sub Saharan A f r ica in FY06 . Other operations included ma in ly 
small-scale investments in logistics, the financial sector, and general manufacturing. IFC also 
stepped up efforts to support small and medium-size en te rp r ises . In close collaboration with 
Cameroon’s largest private sector umbrella organization, G ICAM , IFC provided training, access 
to information, and capacity-building. 

3 1 . 
I FC has also been actively invo lved in the implementation o f a p la t fo rm fo r private public 
dialog to enhance the business environment in Cameroon through the Cameroon B u s i n e s s 
Forum (CBF) fo l low ing the signature o f the M O U between the Government, the Private Sector 
and IFC in January 2009 . The le t te r o f reques t fo r D o i n g Business technical assistance has been 
signed b y the Minister o f Economy on October 2008 and the D o i n g Bus iness Memo has been 
fo rma l ly submitted to the Prime Minister during V P Michael Klein’s v is i t in February 2009 . 
IFC i s currently leading the advisory wo rk required for the G row th Oriented Women 
Entrepreneurs Program (GOWE program) wh ich i s a guarantee program se t up b y the A f r ican 
Development Bank ( AD B ) to fast-track the g row th o f woman owned and operated small and 
medium-sized en te rp r ises in Cameroon.

transport sector during the respective period. These achievements built upon the reforms 
implemented under the Bank's Th i rd Structural Adjustment Credit I11 (SAC 111), wh ich closed in 
Ma rch 2004, and the Transport Sector Project (wh ich closed in December 2003, before the start 
o f the CAS period). One o f the four major development goals o f SAC I11 re la ted to substantially 
lower transport cos ts and to increase the availability o f se rv ices , bo th internationally and 
domestically. This credit was judged to be satisfactory b y 1EG. 
33 . W i t h re fe rence to CAS outcomes, examples o f achievement o f relevant objectives 
included a reduction in costs and improvement o f s e r v i c e s (except in air transport), institutional 
and regulatory reform, privatization o f seve ra l po r t activities, rehabilitation o f infrastructure, 
and dredging wh ich made the port o f Dou la more competitive and efficient. For example, the 
average stay at quay was reduced f rom 3 .8 days to 1 day, c learance delays were reduced, and 
the cost o f import container handling was reduced b y 27 percent. Mo re than 20,000 o f roads 
received maintenance funding and resources fo r maintenance increased dramatically (from 20 
b i l l i o n CFA /US$400m to 40 b i l l i o n CFA/US$800m (during the CAS / ISN period), fo l low ing 
respec t b y the government o f i t s memorandum o f understanding with the E C and other donors. 
R a i l t ra f f ic increased substantially fo l low ing the privatization (concession) o f the railway, and 
funds f lows between the government and the r a i l sector were steadily positive in favor o f the 
government during the whole CAS Period. However, the p r iva t iza t ion strategy fo r C A M A I R 
(the domestic airline) was not implemented and the company remained subject to government 

in te r fe rence . 

34. Du r ing most o f the CAS and ISN period the Bank did not have a project to support the 
achievement o f targets related to the road sector (the C EM AC TTF project was declared 
effective on ly in July 2008, wh ich was very close to the end o f the review period). The Bank 
support provided to the Dou la Infrastructure Project however ensured continuity o f dialogue and 
support, as we l l as capacity to leverage donors' financing support w i t h po l icy reforms and 
capacity bu i ld ing in the sector. At the time o f writing, the I S N milestones have been met: 

a) Regarding direct project activities to the benefit o f the Douala Urban Community, more 
roads were built than was in i t ia l ly projected (27 km versus 23 km and travel time reduced 
by more than 40% except one short leg. A credible survey w i l l be prepared t o con f i rm this 
performance data before the project closes. (A Q A G assessment undertaken o f the Dou la 
Infrastructure project in August 2004 deemed the project t o be moderately unsatisfactory. 
However, i t was deemed too early to make a sound judgment on the project's contribution to 
the CAS). The institutional component was probably not as success fu l , but capacity has 
been pa r t ly built in the community for a better maintenance po l icy and adequate budgets fo r 
road maintenance were provided during most o f the CAS and I S N period. 

b) A component o f the Douala Infrastructure Project supported po l icy dialogue in the Urban 
Development, Public Works and Transport areas. In the Public works sector, funding levels 
for road maintenance, consistent with Memorandum o f Understanding (MOU ) signed by the 
Government as part o f i t s dialogue w i t h the European U n i o n and other partners were 
achieved fo r 2006,2007 and 2008, and the Douala Infrastructure Project contributed to 

69 

re in fo rce capacity in the sector. In the transport sector, the ac tua l con t r ibu t ions o f the p ro jec t 
are going t o be f e l t mos t ly after the review p e r i o d (design o f a l a n d transport strategy) 

3 5 . 
O the r s ign i f ican t outcomes achieved during the C A S and I S N p e r i o d relate t o those 
a r is ing f r o m the R a i lw a y concession P ro jec t w h i c h was comp le ted in June 2009 (The I C R i s

Strategy and Po l icy , w h i c h ca l led for, among others, state d ives t i tu re o f transport operations in 
favo r o f greater p r iva te sector operations. In the last ISR , management comments were provided 
rega rd ing the satisfactory outcome o f this operation, the sus ta inab i l i ty o f the concession f r o m a

the gove rnmen t i s very s ign i f ican t results f o r the p ro jec t . Mo reove r compa r ing the support t o 
the r a i l concession with a l l other concessions in Sub Saharan A f r ica , i t s pe r fo rmance was 
considered t o be one o f the best in the continent. 
36 . With regards to a i r transport, outcomes have o n l y been p a r t i a l l y met. Audits o n security 
have been undertaken but no t in re la t ion t o security. This outcome has been supported by the 
B a n k through a reg iona l project, name ly the West and Cen t ra l A f r i c a Air Transport Safety and 
Security P ro jec t . (The program 's m a i n ob jec t ive i s to create a safe and secure env i ronmen t for 
a i r transport in the West and Central A f r i c a region). S ign i f ican t i s s u e s are being experienced

41. Forests have a profound significance fo r poverty reduction in Cameroon. I t i s the largest 
employer in rural areas; and represen ts an important area o f economic diversification, p rov id ing 
a hedge against the national income to export p r ice shocks im p l i c i t in the country’s significance 
re l iance on o i l revenues. Good progress has been made b y the Bank to mee t the associated CAS 
outcomes and I S N milestones; the Bank has been considerably invo lved in relevant sector 
reforms over the past several years and has played an important ro le in coordinating 
international partners’ support for the forestry sector in Cameroon (e.g., the code de conduite 
established b y the Bank between donors strongly reflected the goals o f the Paris Declaration). 
Relevant support was provided b y the I M F and the Bank w i th in the framework o f the Th i rd 
Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC 111) which closed in Ma rch 2004. This was judged to be 
satisfactory b y IEG w i t h significant outcomes achieved as a r e s u l t o f the bank contributions. 
These included (i) a revamped institutional and regulatory framework, inc lud ing a competitive 
auction system for the award o f the logging rights and independent supervisory mechanisms, 
which resulted in a much improved and more transparent forest management system. (ii) the 
appointment o f an independent observer to monitor these activities and to strengthen 
accountability, (iii) the identification o f 10 percent o f the country’s territory as protected areas 
b y the Government, ( iv ) an important shift f rom log-based to processed products exports and (v) 
revenues f rom forest exploitation were redistributed more equitably to loca l communities. I t 
was also noted b y IEG that the considerable progress achieved in the forestry sector, (e.g., 
management, transparency, downstream activities and exports) was particularly important due 
to the prevalent corruption and the v i ta l importance o f the sector to the economy. 

42. Milestones and CAS outcomes were largely met or exceeded. Bank contributions were 
incorporated w i th in the Forest and Environment Sector Operation. This represented an IDA and 
GEF contribution towards a multi-donor national forest and environment sector development 
program that was initiated and led b y the Government o f Cameroon (due to c lose in December 
2009). In t e r m s o f progress, 69 percent o f forestry concessions have begun implementation o f 
forest management plans. The forestry tax collection rate was achieved; in 2006, about $42 
m i l l i o n were collected and $48 m i l l i o n in 2007. Loca l government bodies now receive sha res 
for local development; in 2007, CFAF 7 b i l l i o n was transferred to loca l governments and ru ra l 
communities. In addition, in 299,238 communities had an approved Community Forest Simple 
Management Plan. F rom this, 13 8 had signed the Management Convention w i t h the 
Government. 

43. 
Some project d i f f icu l t ies have been experienced as a result o f the Government’s decision 
to separate the M in is t r ies o f Forestry and Environment. Nevertheless, other outstanding 
conditions relating to the project are on track to be met. These include (i) allocation o f funds 
from the Government fo r implementation o f annual wo rk plans in accordance w i t h the METF 
and that at least 75 pe rcen t o f the amount o f external contributions allocated in the previous year 

72 

w i l l have been made available in a timely fashion and used for program implementation, (ii) an 
audit o f completed forest management plans fo r community forests attributed before June 2005 
and signed contracts with the companies that meet the requirements, (iii) establishment o f 
financial management and control systems within the M in is t ry o f Finance and Economy, and 
( iv ) implementation o f environmental plans and development o f adequate institutional capacity. 
44. 
W i t h respec t to local development, The Bank has strong multi-sectoral experience in 
local development in Cameroon, and has been instrumental in helping the Government to 
develop and implement operations enabling communities to gain control over s e r v i c e delivery 
and resources allocation. Good progress has been made b y the Bank in relation to achieving 
re la ted CAS outcomes and ISN milestones. 

45 . 
Bank support directed towards meeting the CAS outcome to ensure that farmers reached 
b y extension services derive productivity b e n e f i t s was incorporated w i th in the National 
Ag r icu l tu ra l Extension and Research Program Support Project, designed to improve agricultural 
p roduc t iv i ty and incomes in Cameroon in a sustainable way. This was a fo l low -on intervention 
to the Na t iona l Project for Agricultural Extension (PNVA ) and was completed in June 2004. 
The project was judged to be satisfactory b y IEG. Significant outcomes included improvements 
to the extension s e r v i c e exceeded targets, 879 farmers received training in seed multiplication, 
1,277 subprojects were grant-funded, p rov id ing equipment and small-scale infrastructure to 
producer organizations (the target was 700 subproject grants), the project strengthened the 
formation o f producer groups and promoted community-led development planning and a p i l o t 
operation helped 70-1 00 villages to prepare community development plans. The r e s u l t s o f this 
p i lo t fed in to preparation o f a broader community development program. 

46. 
The Bank provided further support to achieving local community development related 
outcomes and milestones through i t s Community Development Program, (Projet d’appui au 
Programme National de DCveloppement Participatif - PAPNDP). The f i r s t phase o f the 
program was designed to ass is t the GOC to (i) establish a system fo r channeling funds to ru ra l 
communities to finance p r io r i t ized collective infrastructures, (ii) strengthen the capacity o f 
communities to manage their own development and (iii) improve the legal and regulatory 
framework for decentralized rural development. The Bank’s sustainable Agro-pastoral and land 
management promotion project (GEF) was blended with the Community Development Program 
Support project in order to strengthen Government support and development effectiveness with 
increased donor participation. The project i s due t o reach completion in 201 1. Significant 
progress has been made in relation to the CAS outcomes and ISN milestones, particularly in 
relation to the respective progress recorded in the I S N in November 2006 (pg 11). For example, 
targets have now been exceeded in t e rm s o f numbers o f people with improved access to water 
sources and sanitation facilities. According to the las t ISR, approximately 16 health care 
f a c i l i t i e s had been constructed wh ich resulted in an additional 58,000 people with access to 
improved health cen ters . This number i s l ike ly to continue to increase b y an additional 30,000 
b y late 2009. Finally, to date, approximately an additional 102,000 people have access to 
education. This number i s also l ike ly to grow during the course o f the project. The Government 
i s currently in the process o f approving the second phase o f PNDP. 

47. 
Du r ing preparation o f the Chad-Cameroon pipeline (the Petroleum Development and 
Pipeline Project (PDPP), the need fo r capacity bu i ld ing was identified in several areas, 
inc lud ing oil-revenue management in Chad, environmental mon i to r ing in both countries, and 

73 

pe t ro leum sector development in Chad. U l t ima te ly , an IDA-funded capacity building p rog ram 
inc luded th ree operations. The Pe t ro leum Env i ronmen t Capacity Enhancement p ro jec t (capece) 
was one o f these th ree operations and closed in Novembe r 2007. A separate IEG review was 
undertaken o f this project; ove ra l l bank performance i s ra ted mode ra te ly satisfactory but based 
o n modest ratings f o r relevance, e f f icacy and e f f ic iency , the overall ou tcome was ra ted 
unsatisfactory. 
A c t i v i t i e s n o t undertaken in this ou tcome cluster inc lude the R u r a l Inves tmen t Climate,

Health Sec to r 
50. 
Cameroon performs poo r ly on health-related MDGs, and continues to experience a 
generalized H I V / A I D S epidemic w i t h a prevalence rate o f 5 . 5 percen t . Mos t key indicators o f 
child health and nutrition within Cameroon have stagnated or worsened since 1990 w i t h a few 
exceptions (e.g., immunizations). The 2001-2010 Health Sector Strategy se rved as the 
overarching framework in the sector. S ince i t s launch in 2002, some important organizational 
and institutional improvements have been introduced but in sp i te o f these improvements, the 
sector faces important challenges. These include (i) excessive centralization o f the health ca re 
system, (ii) human resource issues , (iii) h igh costs wh ich hinder access remains (iv) l o w amount 
o f public funding, (v) cumbersome and slow f l ow o f public funding, (v i ) governance issues and 
(v i i ) fragmented and unreliable monitoring and evaluation systems. D raw ing lessons f rom the 
mid-term review, the M i n i s t r y o f Health launched a participatory process to prepare an 
enhanced and revamped strategy. 
5 1. 
Against this backdrop, l i t t l e progress was made during the CAS / ISN period towards 
meeting the respective outcomes and m i les tones . Bank e f fo r ts to support the f igh t against 
H I V / A ID s within the Multi-sectoral H I V / A I D S operation (MAPS I) were deemed to be h igh ly 
unsatisfactory b y IEG. As noted in the I S N (pg 11) the project team was able to launch a large 
number o f activities; examples included th ree campaigns to in f luence behavioral change, 
support to community action plans was provided in 6,000 communities, and the I S N milestone 
relating to the number o f HIV+pregnant women who received anti-retroviral drugs (ARVs) was 
exceeded ( f rom 499 in 2002 to 4,780 in 2006). MAPS I also supported a p i l o t ARV program 
wh ich expanded access. t o AIDS treatment to vulnerable groups. In sp i te o f this progress, 
adequate mon i to r ing and evaluation was a significant fa i l ing o f the project and made i t almost 
impossible to assess bank contributions. In addition, supervision o f the project became 
extremely difficult due to the large number o f activities and partners involved. 
52. 
The I S N health-related outcomes were revised significantly f rom the CAS to r e f l e c t the 
shift in Government commitment towards a more participatory process in the preparation, 
enhancement and update o f i t s strategy. I t also focused on the attainment o f the MDGs. The 
Country team decided to drop the PRSC, defer M A P S I 1 and to focus resources on the 
development o f a Sector-wide Approach (Swap) in collaboration w i t h the Government and 
other major health sector partners. Designed to support the implementation o f the updated 
Hea l th Sec tor Strategy, the project development objective was to increase u t i l iza t ion and 
improve the quality o f health se rv ices with a particular focus on child and maternal health and 

75 

communicable diseases. (The HIV/AIDS medical related interventions are increasingly going to 
be mainstreamed through the SWaP). 

53 . 
The project became effective in Ma rch 2009. To date, significant delays have been 
experienced in relation to slow response on the ground, disbursements, lack o f progress on 
implementation o f key reforms and lack o f progress on Mon i to r ing and Evaluation. 
Nevertheless, with careful supervision as well as increased government commitment, 
performance i s s t i l l expected to improve over time. The.Bank’s recent co-financing o f the 2010 
Demographic and Health Survey, wh ich i s now underway, i s also expected to contribute 
towards stronger baseline data for the national program. 

V I . 
E d u c a t i o n Sec to r 
54 . 
Cameroon i s l i k e l y to be on track to meet the education MDG o f primary education 
completion rate, The Bank’s Education Development capacity-building project, (Programme 
d ’Appu i au Systkme Educatif, PASE), initiated during the CAS period in 2005 was designed to 
support the respective Government objectives in i t s PRSP, and in particular to reinforce the 
capacity o f the various ministries w i t h responsibility fo r education. The objective o f the 
proposed project was to increase the efficiency and equity o f p r ima ry and secondary education, 
w i t h a focus on disadvantaged areas, and increase capacity fo r h i g h quality training in targeted 
disciplines in higher education. These goals were reaffirmed during the I S N period w i t h the 
objective to contribute towards the Government’s higher level goal to reduce repetition rates 
f rom 30 percent to 10 percent at the national level b y 2015. W i t h respec t to the milestone and 
CAS outcome indicators, marginal improvement was registered in the reduction o f p r ima ry 
repetition rates f rom 25 percent in 2005 to 22 pe rcen t in 2007. D o we know rate fo r 2008? The 
primary completion rate exceeded targets and increased f rom 60 percent in 2003 to 82 percent 
in October 2007. The student teacher ratio f e l l f rom 56 percent to 52 percent in 2008. 
5 5 . 
In sp i te o f the progress made, the Bank’s project was designed for implementation in a 
very weak overall environment, f rom which the W o r l d Bank and other major donors had been 
largely absent fo r many years due to governance concerns. A review o f the Education 
Development Capacity Bu i ld ing project, undertaken in M a y 2008 b y Q A G (QA LP - l ) , rated the 
project as unsatisfactory. Implementation was adversely affected b y weak management 
capacity, lack o f reliable statistical data, concerns about governance and corruption and a h igh ly 
complex institutional environment. In addition, the rev iew asser ted that the development 
outcomes were un l ike ly to be met due to i s s u e s relating to poor design, without clear l i n k s 
between activities, indicators and objectives. O n the basis o f the QA LP r e s u l t s and the request 
from government, a restructuring e f fo r t has been in i t ia ted b y the Bank to revise the DPO and 
the r e s u l t s framework and to reorganize existing and planned activities under four new 
components. Steps have also been undertaken to improve inter-ministerial coordination. The 
Q A G n ow also no tes evidence o f improved disbursement during 2009. 

56. 
Lessons learnt from the QALP rev iew re la te to project design; a more open-ended project 
design may be appropriate in areas in wh ich the Bank has been largely absent f rom substantive 
po l icy dialogue over time, and where there are many unknowns about opportunities to leverage 
change. I f Government commitment to key reforms i s not c lear from the beginning, an approach 
based upon technical assistance or bu i ld ing dialogue may be more appropriate. Lastly, in sp i te 
o f clear advantages related to implementing a broad sectoral approach, the Bank needs to be 
cognizant o f the risks associated w i t h complex parallel s t ruc tu res .

J. I D A Lending 

V. 

57. Portfolio composition. Du r ing the FY04 -06 CAS implementation period, th ree o f the 
seven I D A operations planned were approved b y the Board totaling US$63.2 million. They 
were the Community Development'Program Support Project (US$20 m i l l ion ) ; the Education 
Development Capacity-Building Project (US$18.2 m i l l ion ) ; and the Forest and Environment 
Sector Program (US$25 m i l l ion ) o r ig ina l ly planned for FY04 but approved on ly in FY06 . The 
Board also approved a regional operation (the West and Central A f r i c a Air Transport Safety and 
Security Project that included US$14.5 million o f support t o Cameroon, as well as two Global 
Environment Fac i l i ty (GEF) operations complementing the Forestry and Environment operation 
(US$lO m i l l ion ) and Community Development Program (US$6 m i l l ion ) . In addition, after 
Cameroon reached the H IPC Completion point, an IDA grant was committed to prepay IBRD 
debt outstanding at the completion point. (The Energy Sector Support Project (US$lO million) 
in i t ia l ly planned for FY05 slipped to FY08). 
5 8 . 
There was a slower than anticipated delivery o f new operations during the CAS 
implementation period wh ich re f lec ted Cameroon's uneven performance du r ing the CAS 
period. Operations approved in FY 0 6 were delivered in the fo rm o f grants due to delays in 
reaching the H IPC completion po in t as well as Cameroon's debt vulnerability. New IDA 
commitments during the CAS implementation period amounted to U S $ l 1 0 m i l l i o n wh ich was 
lower than the US$125 m i l l i o n forecast in the CAS base-case scenario. 
59. Du r ing the I S N period, a balance o f approximately US$ 220 m i l l i o n was made available 
for I D A operations. Add i t iona l resources o f US$50 m i l l i o n were also added to the IDA 
allocation as a result o f the H IPC and MDRI debt r e l i e f . De l ive ry o f new operations improved 
significantly; in f ive IDA lending operations and one supplemental credit were approved 
totaling US$240 m i l l ion , and in l i n e with the indicative financing envelope. These included the 
Urban and Water Development Support project (US$80 m i l l ion ) , the Transparency & 
Accountability Capacity Development Project (US$15 million), the Energy Sector Development 
Project (US$65 m i l l ion ) , and the Hea l th Sector Support Swap Project (S$25 m i l l ion ) . In 
addition, the Board approved the Environmental and Social capacity bu i ld ing fo r Energy project 
(US$20 m i l l ion ) . Part o f this amount ( U S $ 3 5 million) related to a regional operation, the 
Regional Transport and Transit Facilitation Project (the remaining amount o f the project o f 
US$112 m i l l i o n was financed from the Regional Integration allocation). B o t h the Multi-Sector 
H I V / A I D S MAP11 and the regional C EM AC Regional Financial Institutions projects, in i t ia l ly 
planned fo r FY08 were deferred. 
60. 
Portfolio Age. As o f December 2008, the po r t fo l io age was somewhat young; the average 
age for the 10 p ro jec ts under implementation was 2.7 years. A total o f seven projects exited the 
po r t fo l io during the CAS and ISN period (FY04-FY08); the average age fo r those seven closed 
p ro jec ts was six years. 
6 1. Portfolio Performance. The number o f projects under implementation grew during the 
CAS / ISN period from seven to 10 projects. Du r ing this time, the percent o f active p ro jec ts at 
risk decreased substantially f rom 33.7 percen t in 2004 to 5 percen t in 2008 (in t e r m s o f 
amounts). This represented a significant improvement over that o f previous years. On the other 
hand, disbursement ratios deteriorated during the period in question, from 29.7 percent in 2004 
77 

to 1 1.9 percen t in 2008 reflecting start up and implementation delays, as well as other issues 
inc lud ing financial management and counterpart funding. In response, in addition to focus on 
supervision, the Bank has h i red spec ia l is t consultants to assist to iden t i fy and overcome the root 
causes for disbursement delays as w e l l as to strengthen Bank representation and expertise in the 
country office. 
62. 
Design and Quality at En t ry . One project was rated for Quality-at-Entry by Q A G during 
the CAS / ISN period (FY04-05) and again in the Quality assessment o f Lending Po r t fo l io 
(QALP) in M a y 2008, namely the Education development capacity-building project. In the 
Quality-of-Entry review, the project received a moderately satisfactory rating. Strong aspects o f 
the project related to (i) the consistency o f project objectives w i t h the respective CAS pillar, (ii) 
the very effective former po l icy dialogue and preparatory wo rk undertaken w i t h the 
Government, (iii) the c la r i ty o f project components and sub-components, ( iv ) the economic and 
financial analyses and (v) the M&E framework. Areas fo r improvement identified in the report 
included (i) the behavioral l i n k s between planned interventions and outcome targets (ii) weak 
integration o f the higher education component w i t h i s s u e s addressed at the primary and 
secondary level, (iii) the lack o f clarity regarding h ow the GDLN w i l l advance the project’s Dos 
and ( iv ) further opportunities to improve social development impact could have been exploited. 
In the QA LP review, w i t h respec t to the l ike l ihood o f the project reaching its Development 
Objectives, the project received an un l ike ly . I s s u e s noted relate to significant i s s u e s w i t h 
implementation and delays with the PIU, as we l l as significant obstacles to coordination as a 
result o f the mu l t ip l ic i ty o f ministries. A t the same time, the panel noted evidence o f improved 
disbursement and the lag time seen in improvement o f certain indicators wh ich reflected efforts 
to bu i ld capacity w i th in the Ministries. 

63. 
Quality of Supervision. One project was rated fo r Quality o f Supervision b y Q A G during 
the CAS / ISN period in August 2004: the Cameroon Dou la Infrastructure project was rated as 
moderately unsatisfactory overall. M a i n problems encountered related to procurement delays 
and lack o f road maintenance in the Dou la municipality. 

64. Closedprojects. W i t h respec t to projects that exited the po r t fo l io , four out o f seven 
projects received satisfactory ratings across a l l o f the f ive performance categories in IEG 
reviews. This included the Transport Sector Privatization Project, the Na t iona l Agricultural 
Extension and Research Program Support Project, the Cameroon SAC I11 as w e l l as the Debt 
Re l ie f Grant. In terms o f outcomes, two projects, namely the Cameroon Petroleum Environment 
Capacity Enhancement Project and the Public-Private partnership fo r growth Project were rated 
unsatisfactory and the Multi-sectoral H I V / A I D S project was rated h igh ly unsatisfactory. Issues 
re la ted to lack o f government commitment, borrower performance, fiduciary and safeguard 
related i s s u e s as we l l as poor project design, management, supervision and M&E. 
K. I D A Non-lending 
65. 
Du r ing the CAS / ISN implementation period, significant efforts were undertaken to 
update the stock o f country knowledge covered b y core diagnostics. Du r ing the CAS period, 
AAA e f fo r ts included sector wo rk in the education, health, and urban sectors; a Development 
Policy Review; a Poverty Assessmen t ; a Country Procurement Assessmen t Review; and a 
Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review. An Investment Climate 
Assessmen t and a Report on the Observance o f Standards and Codes (ROSC) fo r accounting 
and auditing was also completed. In addition to these activities, considerable support was 

78 

provided towards implementing E I T I and Paris Declaration on aid effectiveness, as well as 
stepped-up support fo r managing the structural re fo rm agenda under the H IPC process, 
inc lud ing intensive analytical and advisory support on the energy sector. 
66. Economic and Sector Work (ESW. Q A G rated four o f the six assessed products 
inc lud ing a l l o f the core diagnostic ESW tasks in i t s sample completed during the FY04-06 
CAS implementation period as h igh ly satisfactory or satisfactory, compared to the marginally 
unsatisfactory overall performance ra t ing for FY02-05. The Q A G assessment highlighted Bank 
inputs and processes, coherence and integration, and dissemination as areas need further 
improvement. 

67. 
Technical Assistance and Policy Advice. AAA efforts during the I S N pe r iod were 
designed to reinforce the Bank’s financing program, w i t h primary focus on areas o f pressing 
concern to the Government. Support included continuation o f the po l icy dialogue and technical 
assistance in key areas o f Bank Group engagement, outreach and dissemination o f key pieces o f 
analytical wo rk completed in FY06, and analysis o f emerging issues , inc lud ing the 
anticorruption agenda. The FY07-08 wo rk program focused on sector dialogue and knowledge 
generation on governance including corruption (coordinated anticorruption support w i t h other 
development partners, dissemination o f the Public Expenditure Management and Financial 
Accountability Review and E IT I and private sector development (dissemination o f the 
Investment Climate Assessment and ROSC and support to the se t up o f the national investment 
forum. 
68. F inanc ing Instruments. Du r ing the CASASN period, IDA funding continued to be 
predominantly in the f o rm o f investment lending. In M a y 2006, the Government and i t s major 
health sector partners agreed to develop a Swap to support the design and implementation o f the 
updated health sector strategy. 

V I . Aid Coordination/Donor harmonization 
69. Partnerships. Cameroon i s one o f the least aid-dependent countries in Sub-Saharan 
Africa, w i t h a small number o f development partners. The H IPC completion po in t marked a 
significant shift in the relationship between the Government and international development 
partners. The Bank has pursued i t s activities in close collaboration with partners, examples 
include efforts to support the Government’s leadership in implementing the Paris Declaration on 
aid effectiveness, inc lud ing developing more effective coordination and dialogue mechanisms 
centered on the PRSP, and mov ing toward sector-wide approaches, fo r example, the Sw a p 

support to the health sector. 

70. 
C l ien t surveys were undertaken at the end o f the CAS period in FY05 as w e l l as in FY09 . 
In 2009 the Bank received a rating o f 6.6, on a t e n po in t scale, that the Bank has been wo rk ing 
w i t h other donor partners to foster the alignment and harmonization o f donor support w i t h the 
requirements o f Cameroon’s national development strategy, and a 6.5 rating that the Bank has 
been adequately encouraging the Government to lead the coordination o f i t s donor partners. The 
Bank was also perceived to be fa i r ly effective at promoting the inclusion o f others in the 
development o f strategies, inc lud ing c i v i l society, private sector, loca l communities and loca l 
project experts.

V I I . Client Feedback 
71. 
Client surveys were undertaken at the end o f the CAS period in FY05 as well as in FY09 . 
Lessons f rom the FY05 c l i e n t survey, which captured the views o f stakeholders in Cameroon, 
recen t analytical work, annual PRSP progress r e orts and an independent assessment o f 
partnerships and aid relationships in Cameroon were incorporated w i t h i n the I S N . 
72. 
In FY09, a total o f 258 stakeholders participated in the country survey, drawn f rom 
different organizations and sectors. Employees o f ministries comprised the largest percentage o f 
respondents (23%), fo l lowed b y the private sector (1 5%), media (1 l%), 
academics (lo%), 
NGOs (9%), O f f ice o f the President (7%) and Loca l government (7%). A small number o f 
responses were received b y Parliamentarians, faith-based groups, bilateral or multilateral 
agencies and other organizations. The ma jo r i ty o f respondents indicated that they came f rom 
Yaounde (67%). Nearly three-quarters o f a l l respondents indicated that they have been invo lved 
w i t h or a close observer o f Wo r ld Bank activities for more than th ree years. 
73. 
In t e r m o f general i s s u e s facing Cameroon, imp rov ing governance was considered to be 
the most important development p r io r i ty fo r Cameroon; a total 52 percent o f respondents had 
either marked this as the f i r s t or second most important p r io r i ty . This amount had increased 
significantly from FY05 where respondents had rated imp rov ing government effectiveness and 
reducing corruption equally (32 percen t o f respondents). Corruption was considered to be the 
second most important p r io r i ty (28 pe rcen t o f respondents) fo l lowed b y imp rov ing the 
investment/business climate (24 percent). Other respondents had rated imp rov ing basic 
infrastructure, increasing employment, achieving universal access to education and controlling 
the spread o f H I V / A ID s as the most important development priorities. 

74. W i t h respec t to areas wh ich wou ld contribute most to poverty reduction, 30 percent o f 
respondents indicated that imp rov ing governance and agriculture development would be most 
significant. Infrastructure development, reducing corruption and increasing employment were 
also seen as key to reducing poverty in the FY09 survey. These views varied considerably 
according to the different stakeholders; fo r example, respondents f rom the o f f ice o f the 
President indicated that infrastructure development wou ld contribute most to poverty reduction, 
employees o f ministries f e l t that imp rov ing governance and increasing employment generating 
opportunities wou ld be most significant and parliamentarians and respondents from the private 
sector indicated that agriculture development wou ld have the most impact. 

75. Across a l l respondents, the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Cameroon received a mean 
rating o f 5.2 o n a 10 point scale, w i t h 1 being very unfavorable and 10 being very favorable. 
This was a slight dec l ine f rom the rating o f 5.6 in the c l ien t survey o f FY05. In terms o f i t s 
poverty mission, the Bank was perceived as somewhat effective at g iv ing appropriate p r io r i ty to 
poverty reduction in Cameroon - receiving a mean rating o f 3.2 across a l l respondents on a 5 
po in t scale. 

76. 
Respondents indicated that the Bank’s greatest values to Cameroon were i t s financial 
resources and po l icy and economic advice. The Bank’s knowledge and lending were also h igh ly 
valued. There was strong agreement that the Bank aligned i t s programs and approaches w i t h the

Development Institute, July 2006. 

80 

 
requirements o f Cameroon’s PRSP. Mo re specifically, respondents in this year’s country survey 
gave significantly higher ratings fo r the Bank’s effectiveness at he lp ing to improve the quality 
o f l i f e in urban areas and helping to strengthen the transport and power and energy sectors 
compared to respondents f rom the FY05 country survey. Respondents also saw the Bank as 
most effective at ensuring that attention i s paid t o the environmental impact o f Bank programs 
and safeguarding against corruption in projects. Other areas o f effectiveness related to 
imp rov ing s e r v i c e delivery in the health and education sectors, helping to strengthen 
infrastructure development and ensuring that attention i s paid to gender disparities. 
77. 
W i t h respec t to improvements, 30 percent o f respondents indicated that the Bank should 
reduce the complexity o f obtaining Bank financing and improve the quality o f i t s experts as 
related to Cameroon’s s p e c i f i c challenges. Specific areas o f weakness related to the Bank 
imposing technocratic solutions without regard to po l i t ica l realities (44 pe rcen t o f respondents) 
and being too bureaucratic in i t s operational policies and procedures (41 percent o f 
respondents). Overall, suggested areas fo r improvement include: 
- Accessibility 
- Imp rov ing how i t s operational policies and procedures are aligned w i t h country demand 
- He lp ing government lead on donor coordination 
- Reducing complexity o f obtaining the Wo r ld Bank financing 
- Balancing level o f relevant expertise as the country’s specific challenges 

78. 
Going forward, the survey indicated that the Bank i s expected to play a somewhat 
significant ro le in Cameroon’s development over the medium te rm . In addition, 62% o f a l l 
respondents indicated that the Bank should be more invo lved in Cameroon’s development 
strategies. 

V I I I . Conclusions and Lessons 
7 9 . Against a backdrop f rom wh ich the Wo r ld Bank and other ma jo r donors have been 
largely absent fo r many years due to governance concerns, as w e l l as a changing development 
context, during the CAS / ISN period, the Bank recorded strong performances in some outcome 
c lus te rs and sectors and on ly modest progress in others. 

80. Cameroon’s uneven performance during the CAS period resulted in a slower than 
anticipated delivery o f new operations, making outcomes difficult to achieve; new I D A 
commitments during the CAS implementation period were lower than CAS base-case scenario. 
Du r ing the I S N period, however, delivery o f new operations doubled ( f rom US$1 10 m i l l i o n to 
US$240 m i l l ion ) , and the number o f projects under implementation grew seven to 10 projects. 
Du r ing this time, the pe rcen t o f active projects at risk also decreased substantially f rom 33.7 
percent in 2004 to 5 percent in 2008 (in t e r m s o f amounts) which also represented a significant 
improvement over that o f previous years. 

8 1. 
The CAS objectives in the I S N were changed somewhat at the end o f the CAS period to 
r e f l e c t changes in the external environment, for example, an additional outcome c lus te r was 
added to support the rev is ion o f the PRSP. In addition, the reorganization o f existing CAS 
outcomes in to six outcome c lus ters improved implementation as well as actions undertaken to 

81 

strengthen the country o f f ice and mon i to r ing o f the I S N . These actions included (i) the 
decentralization o f several international staff to the f ie ld (ii) strengthening o f support and 
expertise fo r forestry and environment and ru ra l and agriculture development and an 
infrastructure specialist, (iii) the appointment o f a senior private sector expert to fully integrate 
Wo r ld Bank Group activities in support o f the private sector (and iv) a decrease in the number 
o f single -standing missions, replaced by j o i n t missions w i t h other international partners. 

82. 
Du r ing the ISN period, good progress was made in supporting infrastructure and urban 
development as we l l as in supporting forestry and environment sectors and strengthening rural 
and agricultural development. Respective IEG reviews o f ICRs con f i rm strong resu l ts and a 
strong l ike l ihood o f meeting development goals. The Bank has been instrumental in helping the 
Government to develop and implement operations enabling communities to gain control over 
service delivery and resource allocation. W i t h respec t to outcomes and milestones relating to 
governance and the PRSP outcome cluster, the Bank has provided important contributions 
wh ich have la id the groundwork for future impact. Examples include the Debt Re l ie f Grant 
under the Enhanced H IPC in i t ia t ive as we l l as the Development Po l icy Review and Poverty 
Assessment. L i t t le progress was made in achieving the outcomes and milestones in private 
sector development and the health sector. In particular, Cameroon continues to make very slow 
progress w i t h respec t to i t s indicators relating to starting a new bus iness . 

83. As re f lec ted in the deteriorating disbursement ratios, many o f the planned projects 
experienced s ta r t up and implementation effectiveness delays during the I S N period, suggesting 
that actual contributions are going to be f e l t mostly after the review period. Projects include the 
C EM AC Regional Institutions Support Project, the Energy Sector Development Project and the 
Urban and Water development project. In response, the Bank has hired specialist consultants t o 
ass is t to iden t i fy and overcome the root causes fo r delays. Other projects such as the Education 
Development Capacity Bu i ld ing project was significantly restructured in response to feedback 
and learning QA LP resu l ts .

Simpler project design to ensure a fit with Government’s implementation capacity. In 
addition, more open-ended project designs may be appropriate in areas in which the Bank 
has been largely absent f rom substantive po l icy dialogue over time for example, the 
Education sector. 
Other IEG reviews have indicated the importance o f effective supervision and mon i to r ing 
and evaluation systems w i t h a recommendation to withdraw f rom ce r ta in projects i f 
considerable opposition and delay are encountered. Bank teams should be attentive to the 
frequent disparity in commitment between the po l i t ica l and administrative levels. 
The p rov is ion o f grant funding fo r productive equipment and infrastructure can be 
fruitfully combined w i t h attempts to strengthen farmer organizations and boost incomes, 
as demonstrated in the Ag r icu l tu ra l Extension and Research Program Support Project. 
Overall the Bank continues to face considerable challenges in developing reliable data 
baselines for key performance indicators due to lack o f availability o f solid data. For 
example, key lessons learnt in relation t o the M A P project (stemming f rom the IEG 

82 

review), inc luded the impo r tance o f an accurate assessment o f the baseline s i tua t ion 
w h i c h i s c r i t ica l t o designing and eva lua t ing an e f fec t ive p ro jec t .
