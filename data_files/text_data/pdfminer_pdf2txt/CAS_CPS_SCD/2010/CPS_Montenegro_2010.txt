EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

i. 
Montenegro, the smallest republic in former Yugoslavia, is endowed with a beautiful 
coastline on the Adriatic Sea, a moderate climate, and close proximity to European and Russian 
markets. Montenegro’s population was estimated in 2010 at 667,000. Montenegro’s small, open economy 
is largely based on activities in the tertiary sector—especially tourism—and agriculture. The energy 
sector could become an important source of growth and exports, provided that environmental impacts can 
be adequately contained and investments do not create large negative externalities encroaching on the 
country’s tourism potential. Aluminum and steel production, joint with bauxite and coal mining, remain 
vital (albeit economically vulnerable) activities, with aluminum products comprising about 40 percent of 
all merchandise exports. Given a per capita income of nearly US$6,900 in 2009, Montenegro is a higher 
middle-income economy with relatively low levels of poverty. Trade with the European Union (EU)—
especially with Greece and Italy, Montenegro’s second and third-largest export markets (after Serbia)—
underpin most economic activity and international commerce. EU member states and Russia account for a 
significant proportion of FDI inflows. 

ii. 
Since independence in mid-2006, Montenegro has taken important steps towards EU 
candidate country status. The Government signed and ratified the Stabilization and Association 
Agreement (SAA) with the European Commission (EC) in late 2007, allowing the interim agreements on 
trade, visa facilitation, and readmission to become effective by January 2008. For Montenegrin citizens 
with biometric passports, the EU lifted visa requirements for travel into Schengen countries in December 
2009. EU member states completed the process of ratifying Montenegro’s SAA in March 2010, allowing 
the Agreement to formally enter into force in May 2010. In its November 2010 opinion on Montenegro’s 
December 2008 EU membership application, the European Commission (EC) recommended to the 
European Council to award Montenegro the formal status of EU candidate country. On December 17, 
2010 the Council decided to grant Montenegro candidate status.  The EU announced that it would open 
accession talks after Montenegro has complied with Copenhagen political criteria in the areas of public 
administration and rule of law. The EC has highlighted several key priorities in its opinion, including 
public-administration and judicial-sector reforms to enhance professionalism and foster de-politicization.  

iii. 
The three-year episode of rapid growth was followed by a sharp economic contraction, 
caused by the combined effects of a busting boom and the effects from the global financial crisis, and 
signs of a gradual recovery as of mid-/late 2010. During 2006–08, annual GDP growth rates averaged 
nearly 9 percent, propelled by strong domestic and external demand, rapid credit expansion, and 
substantial FDI flows, which were largely concentrated in the real-estate, construction, and tourism 
sectors. The global crisis precipitated a severe credit crunch as (i) the private sector withdrew funds from 
the banking system; (ii) foreign mother banks limited their exposure to the Montenegrin market; and (iii) 
domestic banks consolidated their portfolios, resulting in the accumulation of payment arrears within the 
private sector. Reduced external demand for exports—in conjunction with very large and adverse terms-
of-trade shocks—led to the near-collapse of the industrial sector, including the pivotal aluminum industry, 
partly reflecting the drop in world prices well below the company’s break-even point. The combined 
impact of reduced access to credit and loss of export markets, together with eroding confidence and 
escalating labor conflicts, led to a severe recession in 2009, with an estimated GDP contraction of 5.7 
percent. Tourism (accounting for nearly a quarter of the economy) remained a bright spot during the 
recession, holding steady in 2009 and showing signs of growth in 2010. FDI flows remained buoyant, 
partly reflecting the partial privatization of EPCG in 2009 and bank recapitalizations in 2010. Investor 
confidence in Montenegro seemed to be confirmed by the oversubscription of the country’s first 
international bond issue in 2010, which raised €200 million in 5-year Eurobonds at a rate of 7.875 
percent. 

i 

 
 
iv. 
The experiences from the post-independence boom-bust cycle, amplified by the global 
financial crisis, revealed structural weaknesses and heightened the government’s responsiveness to the 
need to adjust the underlying growth model. The implicit susceptibility of Montenegro’s small, open 
economy to changes in the external environment, paired with the pro-cyclicality of its most important 
sectors and the underlying tax system, has placed an increased premium on reforms aimed at increasing 
(i) knowledge, productivity, and innovation; (ii) employment, professional perspective, and social 
inclusion; and (iii) energy efficiency and environmental protection. Given Montenegro’s decision in 
1999/2000 to adopt the euro as legal tender and the existence of lower—but still large—current account 
deficits, improving the business climate to be able to maintain substantial inflows of foreign direct 
investment remains the principal anchor of economic policy-making. Related reforms complement those 
(to be) introduced in the context of achieving the overarching political objective of EU integration 
(especially those in the rule-of-law area). The European perspective, together with a strengthened judicial 
environment and business climate, would help to increase investors’ confidence in the inherent 
profitability of Montenegro’s economy as a site for investment and business. 

v. 
Against the above background, the CPS seeks both to help the country recover from the 
2009 recession and advance longer-term goals. In particular, the CPS supports Montenegro’s efforts to 
(i) strengthen institutions and competitiveness in line with EU accession requirements; and (ii) improve 
environmental management. Government has requested the Bank to provide support in areas where the 
Bank has previously been engaged in Montenegro and/or gained applicable regional or global experience. 
The centerpiece of the Bank’s engagement will be two financial-sector development policy loans (about 
US$105 million, total in FY11 and FY12), which will support a banking-sector strengthening and 
stabilization program, bring regulations into line with EU norms, and encourage resumption of (healthy) 
credit growth. New investment lending in roughly the same amount will be very selective, given existing 
resource constraints under the new exposure framework, the country’s limited implementation capacity, 
and the substantial portfolio of operations under implementation (about US$55 million still to be 
disbursed). At present, new investment lending is planned for a Higher Education/R&D project (FY12), a 
small investment to facilitate Montenegrin participation in a regional Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility 
(FY12), and an Environmental Clean-up Project (FY13). An additional project could be included for 
FY14, depending on client demand and timely closure of projects in the existing portfolio. Technical 
assistance, analytical work, and advisory services will support convergence with EU norms in selected 
sectors, address key issues of competitiveness, and strengthen governance and public sector institutions. 
IFC is expected to provide advisory services to help improve the business climate and country 
competitiveness, and make new investments in private companies as opportunities arise. The expected 
level of support will be on the order of US$40–50 million over the CPS period. 

vi. 
The principal risks to successful implementation of the CPS are fivefold. First, slower-than-
expected growth in South-East Europe and the EU could dampen Montenegro’s fledgling recovery and 
exacerbate fiscal vulnerabilities—especially high external debt. Second, ongoing weaknesses in the 
banking sector could perpetuate a constrained credit environment and choke off private-sector led growth. 
Third, lack of progress on institutional strengthening and governance improvements—especially in those 
areas mentioned by the European Commission in its opinion as prior actions for opening membership 
negotiations—could undermine Montenegro’s path towards EU accession and its efforts to continue to 
attract significant flows of FDI. Fourth, CPS goals of portfolio consolidation could be adversely affected 
if current efforts to reinforce implementation capacity (especially with respect to procurement and 
financial management) prove inadequate or ineffective. Finally, much of the country is vulnerable to 
natural disasters including both droughts and flooding which could impose tremendous hardships for 
households and businesses in both the coastal and mountain areas.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

1. 
This Country Partnership Strategy for FY11–FY14 builds on the Bank’s sustained 
engagement with Montenegro—both before and after its declaration of independence in mid-2006. The 
FY02–FY04 Transitional Support Strategy for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) included a 
discrete program of Bank support for Montenegro, as did the FY05–FY07 CAS for the State Union of 
Serbia and Montenegro (SCG). The Bank’s engagement during the pre-independence period was focused 
on supporting Montenegro’s efforts to build a market economy and re-establish growth after a period of 
regional conflict and intense instability, both through Analytical and Advisory services (AAA) and new 
investments especially in energy and water. In mid-2007, the Bank and country authorities developed 
Montenegro’s first post-independence Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) covering FY07–FY10. The 
CPS deepened the Bank’s engagement in infrastructure, the social sectors, and public sector management, 
as well as marked Montenegro’s graduation from IDA into the ranks of middle-income IBRD borrowers. 
A CPS Progress Report submitted on March 20, 2009 took stock of progress on the FY07–FY10 CPS and 
made necessary adjustments to the program in view of the evolving economic crisis. Attached as an annex 
to this report is a CPS Completion Report, which assesses Bank support for Montenegro during FY07–
FY10 and identifies lessons relevant for the Montenegro-Bank partnership over the next years. 

2. 
Following independence, Montenegro grew rapidly, while taking important steps in its 
European Union (EU) integration process. The Government signed and ratified the Stabilization and 
Association Agreement (SAA) with the European Commission (EC) in late 2007, allowing the interim 
agreements on trade, visa facilitation, and readmission to become effective by January 2008. For 
Montenegrin citizens with biometric passports, the EU lifted visa requirements for travel into Schengen 
countries in December 2009. Already in 2008, Government approved a National Program for Integration 
(NPI), a comprehensive plan to reform policies and standards towards the full implementation of the EU 
acquis communautaire, while EU member states completed the process of ratifying Montenegro’s SAA in 
March 2010, allowing the Agreement to formally enter into force in May 2010. Following Montenegro’s 
formal membership application 
in December 2008 and 
its submission of responses 
to 
the 
accompanying—very comprehensive—questionnaire of more than 2,850 questions in late 2009 and early 
2010, European Commission (EC) recommended to the European Council to award Montenegro the 
formal status of EU candidate country. On December 17, 2010 the Council decided to grant Montenegro 
candidate status. The EU announced that it would open accession talks once Montenegro had complied 
with Copenhagen political criteria in the areas of public administration and rule of law. The EC has 
highlighted key priorities in its opinion, including public-administration and judicial-sector reforms to 
enhance professionalism and foster de-politicization.  

3. 
The current CPS is being prepared at a time when Montenegro is striving to recover from 
the sharp economic contraction; the CPS thus seeks both to help the country (i) recover from the 
impact of the financial and economic shock; and (ii) support Government’s longer-term objectives of 
building modern institutions, promoting international competitiveness, and improving environmental 
management. In this regard, Government has requested the Bank to provide budgetary and investment 
support (as well as knowledge services) in areas where the Bank has previously been engaged in 
Montenegro and/or gained regional or global experience applicable to the Montenegrin context. In 
particular, the CPS supports Montenegro’s efforts in addressing some critical developmental challenges, 
viz., to (i) strengthen institutions and competitiveness in line with EU accession requirements; and (ii) 
improve environmental management and reduce the cost of environmental problems. The centerpiece of 
the Bank’s engagement will be two financial-sector development policy loans (about US$105 million) 
which will support a banking-sector strengthening and stabilization program, bring regulations into line 
with EU norms, and help to put Montenegro back on a positive growth path by encouraging healthy credit

growth. New investment lending in roughly the same amount will be very selective, given existing 
resource constraints under the new exposure framework, the country’s limited implementation capacity, 
and the substantial portfolio of operations under implementation (about US$55 million still to be 
disbursed). Technical assistance, analytical work, and advisory services will support convergence with 
EU norms in selected sectors, address key issues of competitiveness, and strengthen governance and 
public sector institutions. IFC is expected to provide advisory services to help improve the business 
climate and country competitiveness, and make new investments in private companies as opportunities 
arise. The expected level of support will be on the order of US$40–50 million over the CPS period. 

II.  COUNTRY CONTEXT 
A. Overview 
4. 
 Montenegro, the smallest republic in former Yugoslavia, is endowed with a beautiful 
coastline on the Adriatic Sea, a moderate climate, and close proximity to European and Russian 
markets. Montenegro’s population was estimated in 2010 at 667,000. The key sectors of Montenegro’s 
small, open economy include tourism, given its attractive beaches and coastal towns, and agriculture, 
including production of tobacco, olives, citrus fruits, and livestock. Montenegro’s energy sector could 
also become the engine of growth in the near future, particularly as foreign (principally Italian) investors 
have shown keen interest in investing in Montenegro’s hydro-/thermopower production and its 
distribution capacity, linking the local grid, via a trans-Adriatic transmission line, to Italy’s electricity 
network. However, careful consideration will need to be given to environmental impacts. Steel and 
aluminum production, joint with bauxite and coal mining, remain important—albeit economically 
vulnerable—activities, with aluminum products comprising about 40 percent of all merchandise exports. 
Given a per capita income of nearly US$6,900 in 2009, Montenegro is a higher middle-income economy 
with relatively low levels of poverty. Trade with the EU—especially with Greece and Italy, which (after 
Serbia) are Montenegro’s second and third-largest export markets—underpin most economic activity and 
international commerce. EU member states (together with Russia) account for a significant proportion of 
FDI inflows. 

5. 
With a 55.5-percent majority in favor of independence, Montenegro ensured full 
international recognition of its separation from Serbia on June 3, 2006 and has since made good 
progress in consolidating its political stability and building institutions. Parliament approved a new 
Constitution in October 2007. Internationally supervised presidential and parliamentary elections have 
been successfully implemented, with OSCE/ODIHR confirming their compliance with international 
standards, cementing the pro-independence, pro-EU and pro-business majority assembled by a coalition 
led by the Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS). Its leader, Milo Đukanović, who was in power for 
almost two decades (one term as President and six terms as Prime Minister), has prepared and managed 
the political transition of executive power to a younger generation of politicians, allowing him to retire as 
Prime Minister on December 21, 2010 and designating his deputy, Finance Minister Igor Lukšić, to 
prepare Montenegro for accession talks and eventual EU membership. Opposition parties, partly 
ethnically based, have not overcome their fragmentation and proven unsuccessful in presenting the 
electorate with convincing alternatives. 

Macroeconomic Performance and Outlook 

6. 
Montenegro’s pro-business policies and clear European perspective helped to achieve 
strong growth up until mid-2008. As shown in the accompanying Figure 1, average 2006–08 GDP 
growth has been almost 9 percent, propelled by strong domestic and external demand, rapid credit 
expansion, and substantial foreign direct investment (FDI), particularly in the real estate, construction, 

2 

 
 
and tourism sectors (see November 2008 Public Expenditure and Institutional Review). Credit to the 
private sector grew from 33 percent of GDP in 2005 to 83 percent by June 2008, and net FDI averaged 19 
percent of GDP over 2007 and 2008. At the same time, rapidly increasing imports and falling exports 
drove the current account deficit (CAD) from 8.5 percent of GDP in 2005 to 51.8 percent in 2008. 

Figure 1: GDP Growth 2005-2007 

7. 
The post-independence boom had 
masked structural weaknesses, and the global 
financial crisis then amplified effects of the 
bust that had already started to become visible 
as of mid-2008, 
resulting 
in a notable 
deterioration of macroeconomic and financial 
indicators; see Figure 1. The stock-market 
boom (until mid-2007), the real-estate boom 
(until mid-2008), private-sector credit growth 
rates of 140 and 180 percent in 2006 and 2007, 
respectively, together with very high, FDI-
financed current account deficits, symbolized 
the vulnerability of the small, open economy to 
exogenous shocks. The global crisis resulted in 
the economy’s acute illiquidity, as the private 
sector withdrew considerable funds from the banking system, while foreign mother banks stopped their 
race for market share and, instead, consolidated their investments—leading to more than two years of 
consistent negative private-sector credit growth rates and, subsequently, the accumulation of payment and 
wage arrears in the private sector and a significant increase of non-performing loans towards the banking 
sector. The reduction in external demand for Montenegro’s exports, together with very large, adverse 
terms-of-trade shocks, led to the near collapse of the industrial sector, including the pivotal aluminum 
industry, where world prices—at the peak of the crisis—had dropped to levels of one-half the company’s 
break-even point (see Box A). The resultant decrease in investments, together with eroding confidence 
and escalating labor conflicts, led to a severe recession in 2009, with an estimated GDP contraction of 5.7 
percent. The tourism sector, representing almost one-quarter of GDP, has held steady in the crisis year 
2009 and appears to have rebounded in 2010. 

8. 
Montenegro’s fiscal trends were closely linked to the country’s growth performance (Table 
1). The general government achieved fiscal surpluses in 2006 and 2007 of 3.0 and 6.7 percent, 
respectively, on the back of increased tax revenues, particularly value-added taxes on imports. These 
surpluses drove an expansionary fiscal policy, which boosted consolidated expenditures and net lending 
to 48.9 percent in 2008. Additional outlays covered both capital and recurrent expenditures, including a 
notable expansion of spending on the wage bill, which reached 12 percent of GDP in 2008. Partly as a 
reflection of the pro-cyclical nature of the tax regime, Montenegro’s fiscal position deteriorated after the 
crisis. General government revenues and grants dropped 6 points to 42.5 percent of GDP between 2008 
and 2009. This decline was driven in part by the large arrears of the state electricity company (EPCG), the 
aluminum smelter (KAP), and other large companies, which together accounted for tax arrears of almost 
3 percent of GDP by October 2009. Owing to the widening deficit, gross public debt grew from 29 
percent of GDP in 2008 to 38.2 percent in 2009. External debt—both private and public—rose from 79.4 
percent of GDP in 2007 to an estimated 86.1 percent in 2009. The projections included in Table 1, which 
are IMF staff estimates prepared in November 2010, suggest that the external debt picture could worsen 
slightly over the medium-term. With ongoing measures to tighten control over government expenditure, 
the fiscal deficit for 2010 and over the medium-term horizon will fall gradually. When issuing €200 
million in Eurobonds in mid-2010, Government reiterated its policy commitment to continuing its fiscal 
adjustment towards a balanced budget by 2013. The relatively buoyant tourism season in 2009, the partial 

3 

 
  
privatization and recapitalization of the electricity company, together with efforts by Government to 
tighten control over public expenditures, has led to a overall fiscal deficit in the crisis year 2009 of around 
5 percent. Further efforts in this direction, paired with the difficulty that the private sector is experiencing 
in obtaining credit, would help to contain rapid increases in debt ratios. 

Box A: Restructuring the Aluminum Sector 

The aluminum smelter KAP, majority-owned by Oleg Deripaska-owned CEAC (in late 2010, one-half its shares 
were transferred back to the national authorities), and the Government of Montenegro have joined forces to prevent 
the company’s bankruptcy and address key challenges that have brought the company to the brink of collapse and 
would have risked widespread social unrest. This situation arose as—following the privatization in late 2005—
KAP’s new management was (i) prevented from purchasing the 
Pljevlja thermo power plant in mid-2007 (which would have given 
the company direct and secure access to cheaper energy); (ii) 
obliged 
to maintain KAP’s 
(partly 
idle) workforce and, 
consequently, to finance any modernization investments with credits 
from international banks; and (iii) affected severely by the negative 
terms-of-trade shocks that followed the global financial crisis 
(aluminum prices fell by more than one-half between mid- and end-
2008).  
Following CEAC’s decision to drop a large international arbitration 
case, the Government accepted one-half of CEAC shares, or 29.4 
percent of the aluminum smelter, against an agreement to (i) provide 
CEAC with €135 million in loan guarantees necessary to restructure its debt; (ii) facilitate and co-finance an 
agreement on a social program, thereby allowing KAP to reduce its workforce from about 2,800 in 2008 to 1,100 by 
end-2010; and (iii) subsidize (for a pre-specified) transition period electricity costs at rates below those defined by 
the regulator. A similar arrangement has been agreed for the affiliated Bauxite mine. These measures—along with 
additional actions taken by management to modernize and streamline production—have reduced production costs, 
permitting KAP to take advantage of rising world market prices and plan for an increase of production from less 
than 60,000 tons in 2009 and 80,000 tons in 2010 back to its full capacity of about 120,000 tons over the medium 
term. Although the settlement agreement with Government averted KAP’s collapse, the industry’s long-term 
economic viability will depend critically on (i) CEAC and the Government honoring their respective commitments 
in finding a joint solution to address the smelter’s energy needs with minimum cost to the budget; (ii) KAP’s ability 
to modernize its operations while managing its large historic debt; and (iii) world market remaining at currently 
prevailing levels. 

9. 
The 2008–09 global crisis also exacerbated existing vulnerabilities in Montenegro’s 
banking sector. Underpinned by substantial foreign borrowings (typically from foreign mother banks), 
the growth in domestic banking assets reached 172 percent in 2007, before plummeting sharply by 
December 2009. Rapid increases in credit of 139 percent in 2006, 176 percent in 2007, and 25 percent in 
2008, with heavy exposure to tourism and construction sector, gave way to declining asset quality and an 
increasing share of non-performing loans (NPLs); see Figure 2 below. The massive, broad-based and 
persistent withdrawals from Montenegrin banks, which occurred in the wake of the global financial crisis 
drained liquidity and, coupled with the banks’ own efforts to clean up their loan portfolios by tightening 
credit risk appraisal, led to a severe credit squeeze. Bank-held deposits fell by 31 percent (y-o-y) by June 
2009, and improved only slightly with the revenues from the EPCG recapitalization/partial privatization 
(about 58 percent of related privatization revenues benefited private minority shareholders). Net profits in 
the banking system as a percent of capital dropped from 6.4 percent in June 2008 to a net loss of 18.4 
percent in June 2009, and double this amount by June 2010.

Given 
concerns 
about 
the 
health 
of 
Montenegrin 
banks, 
the 
Government and the Central 
Bank took steps to restore 
confidence in the system and 
make 
it more resilient 
to 
possible future shocks. The 
emergency law for protection 
of the banking sector, including 
the introduction of a temporary 
blanket deposit guarantee and 
the 
possibility 
of 
state 
assistance for vulnerable banks, 
helped 
to stop 
the deposit 
outflow and 
to prevent 
the 
collapse of the second largest 
bank 
in 
the country. The 
Central Bank stepped up the 
supervision of 
systemically 
important banks, agreeing with 
the management and shareholders on supervisory action plans aimed at securing the necessary capital and 
liquidity support. In parallel, the authorities made progress on the longer term agenda of strengthening the 
legal framework for supervision and resolution of financial institutions, striving to bring it closer to EU 
best practice. Working with the World Bank and the IMF, Montenegro prepared amendments to the Law 
on Banks, the Law on Bank Bankruptcy and Liquidation, and new laws on the Central Bank, Deposit 
Insurance Fund, and Financial Stability Council.

11. 
To contain the widening fiscal deficit, the Government undertook politically difficult 
expenditure cuts to consolidate government and expenditure growth, including by privatizing selected 
state assets and awarding concessions. The Government implemented a first round of expenditure cuts in 
early 2009 and a budget revision in July 2009 to account for lower growth under the crisis. The revision 
included the postponement of capital expenditures into future budgets and moderation of the wage bill, 
and led to a general government deficit of around 5 percent in 2009—an outcome that was a vast 
improvement over the 8 percent deficit that had been projected for a non-revised budget. In addition, the 
Government privatized state-owned enterprises and explored options for public private partnerships 
(PPPs) to lessen strain on public revenues. The state electricity company EPCG was unbundled in 2009 
into a transmission company and entity overseeing generation and distribution with the support of Italian 
investors. Further, the legal framework was updated to facilitate concessions in infrastructure, particularly 
transport. Besides improving fiscal conditions, private investment in infrastructure is expected to reduce 
the CAD significantly over the medium-term. In light of these reforms and the good performance of some 
key economic sectors, Montenegro moderated its economic contraction to 5.7 in 2009 and is expected to 
resume growth at about 3-4 percent during 2011–12. 

12. 
There have recently been clearer signs that—with foreign investor confidence having 
remained relatively strong—the Montenegrin economy is recovering from the recession. Preliminary 
estimates suggest that, after a continued contraction during the first half of 2010, a trend reversal 
occurred during the third quarter, following (i) an unexpectedly strong tourist season during the crucial 
summer months (January–August 2010 was up by 7 percent over the same period last year); (ii) the 
bottoming-out of problems in the metal industry (August 2010 was 12 percent higher than August 2009); 
(iii) consistent growth rates in mining (January–August figures are up by 36 percent); and (iv) strong 
growth in the energy sector (+39 percent during January–August). These trends foreshadow an overall 
growth rate for 2010 at slightly above 0 percent, with external imbalances narrowing and fiscal deficits 
remaining below last year’s level. Prices have remained stable, with year-on-year inflation being only –
0.1 percent at end-August. In general, Government has anchored economic policies in the objective of 
providing an environment attractive to private investors. The still-buoyant inflow of FDI—including 
substantial PPPs in tourism, energy and transport—both in 2009 and 2010, seems to validate this 
approach. 

B. Governance and the Business Climate 
13. 
Since independence, Montenegro has made steady progress on a number of institutional, 
economic, and social indicators.  The Government has implemented diverse reforms linked to the EU 
accession agenda and the relevant Copenhagen Criteria addressing democracy, rule of law, human rights, 
and protection of minorities. These and other reforms have, inter alia, improved public administration, 
strengthened the judicial framework, enhanced the role of Parliament, and fostered cooperation on EU 
integration issues across government agencies. Government has also demonstrated commitment to human 
rights protections and civil liberties by ratifying key international treaties and developing a strategy for 
cooperation with NGOs in 2009. Moreover, some progress was achieved in strengthening the rights of 
women and minorities, e.g., through initiating reforms under Montenegro’s 2008–12 Action Plan for 
Gender Equality. Nonetheless, more progress is needed in some areas to satisfy EU requirements and 
unlock additional financial support, including strengthening local government and the civil service, 
promoting judicial independence and enforcing anti-corruption legislation. politicization.

14. 
The strong pace of Montenegro’s reforms has translated into substantial gains in key 
international indicators measuring governance and political and economic performance (see Table 2). 
Montenegro has advanced significantly between 2006 and 2009 on all six of the composite Worldwide 
Governance Indicators (WGIs) published by the World Bank Institute (WBI). Notable gains were achieved on 
political stability, regulatory quality, rule of law, and government effectiveness (See Figure 3a). The indicator 
that shows the least progress is control of corruption. Montenegro’s ranking in Transparency International’s 
Corruption Perception Index rose from 85th in 2008 to 69th in 2010, and Freedom House upgraded its rating of 
Montenegro to Free in 2010 from Partially Free in 2007. Key international indicators for Montenegro and 
neighboring states are presented in Table 2 above, which demonstrate Montenegro’s strong overall gains and 
good performance relative to its SEE neighbors. Figures 3(b-c) show that Montenegro’s formal regulatory 
framework and implementation practices are fully in line with the expectation for a country at its income level.

15. 
Montenegro continued to make significant progress in improving the business climate. 
Montenegro’s ranking in the Ease of Doing Business in the World Bank’s Doing Business Reports 
improved from 85 out of 178 countries in 2009 to 66 out of 183 countries in 2011. The biggest gains were 
reported for ease of trading across borders, starting a business and getting credit. Montenegro’s ranking 
under the World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Index also rose significantly from 82 in 
2007/08 to 49 in 2010/11. Though allegations of high-level corruption remain a concern among EU and 
domestic observers, survey findings suggest that crime and corruption are not frequent obstacles to 
business operations and business development in Montenegro. In the 2008 Business Environment and 
Enterprise Performance Surveys (BEEPS), 65 and 70 percent of Montenegrin businesses indicated, 
respectively, that corruption and crime, theft, and disorder were not business impediments—representing 
a substantially better outcome compared to either the SEE or ECA averages.

The prior actions for EU membership negotiations, as spelt out in the EC’s opinion, define 
current rule-of-law reform priorities. The EU stated that membership negotiations could commence once 
the country had achieved the necessary degree of compliance with, in particular, the Copenhagen political 
criteria “requiring the stability of institutions guaranteeing notably the rule of law”, pointing inter alia to 
public-administration and judiciary-sector reforms aimed at enhancing professionalization, and fostering 
de-politicization.  The authorities have taken on this challenge. Immediately following the EU’s awarding 
of candidate status, the Government underwent a process of rejuvenation (including the transfer of 
premiership to the pragmatic and reform-minded former Finance Minister), with a view to strengthening 
public institutions in those critical areas impacting the country’s EU integration perspective. A critical 
subset of rule-of-law challenges is congruent with structural reforms required to strengthen Montenegro’s 
relative attractiveness as a destination for direct investment—areas in which the Bank has already 
provided considerable support, and proposes to continue to do so under the current CPS. Bank financed 
operations (for land administration and the financial sector) aim to improve the functioning of relevant 
public institutions, and bolster Montenegro’s business environment.  AAA/ESW provides overarching 
policy advice on challenges related to public administration, fiscal policy priorities, public financial 
management and procurement, statistics, and financial reporting.  

C. Poverty and Welfare 

17. 
Strong growth in Montenegro since independence has increased living standards and 
reduced poverty, although some groups remain more vulnerable than others. As a result of rapid GDP 
growth, per capita GDP rose rapidly from about €3,582 in 2006 to €5,143 in 2008 and unemployment fell 
from 22.3 percent in 2004 to an estimated 10.7 percent in 2008. The national poverty rate dropped 
commensurately, from 11.3 percent in 2006 to 8 percent in 2007. However, a relatively higher proportion 
of the population, 18.2 percent, was classified as being “at risk” of falling into poverty, given average 
consumption of less than 25 percent more than the poverty line. Spatial differences in poverty and welfare 
are also a concern: households in the mountainous north are six times more likely to be poor than their 
southern compatriots. In 2008, about 14 percent of northern households were poor versus only 2.2 percent 
of households living in the south. Poverty among the marginalized Roma, Ashkalia, and Egyptian (RAE) 
population is also high (36 percent) but this group comprises less than 2 percent of the Montenegrin 
population. Finally it is worth noting that, unlike in many comparable countries, gender equality and 
empowerment appear to be relatively high in Montenegro, with very little difference apparent between 
overall and gender-specific development indices (see annex 3 on gender).  
18. 
Although social data are limited, available information suggests good progress and 
relatively high human capital achievements relative 
to comparable neighboring countries. 
Montenegro’s rating on the Human Development Index (HDI), climbed from 0.775 in 2000 to 0.828 in 
2007, placing it 65th among 182 countries and exceeding recent ratings in Albania, FRY Macedonia, and 
Bosnia and Herzegovina. Inflows of poorer migrant workers to central and southern regions and slower 
development in northern areas has, however, increased inequality, as reflected by a rise in the Gini 
Coefficient from 0.29 in 2004 to 0.35 in 2008. Available data on MDGs show that good gains have been 
made in boosting access to education, reducing infant and child mortality, and combating tuberculosis. 

9 

 
 
19. 
The dramatic economic downturn in the wake of the global economic crisis likely had a 
detrimental impact on the most vulnerable Montenegrin households. The contraction in growth (2009) 
is likely to have slowed or even reversed some of the gains on social indicators and poverty rates, given 
that nearly a fifth of Montenegrins were deemed to be “at-risk” of poverty. A Bank-supported rapid living 
standards assessment undertaken in 2009 indicates that almost a quarter of all Montenegrins were affected 
by deteriorating labor market conditions in 2009, including 10 percent that experienced wage arrears and 
another 10 percent suffering salary reductions. About 30 percent of crisis-impacted households increased 
their supply of labor, either by having a non-working member find work, or having working members 
seek additional employment. However, the analysis suggests that some poor Montenegrin households 
adopted risky coping strategies that could increase their vulnerability to shocks in the future. For example, 
nearly a quarter of crisis-affected households in the bottom income quintile cancelled health insurance or 
reduced visits to health facilities for preventive care. To the extent, however, that there has been a shift to 
positive growth (and clearance of wage arrears in key industries) in the second half of 2010, there is likely 
to be a commensurately positive impact on poverty. 

III.  COUNTRY CHALLENGES AND GOVERNMENT PROGRAM 

A. 
The Government’s Development Plans 
20. 
The National Program for Integration (NPI), outlining the reform agenda required for 
eventual EU membership, defines Montenegro’s overarching policy objectives. Approved in 2007, the 
NPI is an implementation plan of Montenegro’s Stabilization and Association Process that lays out a 
comprehensive set of political, economic, and sector reforms to harmonize domestic legislation and 
practices with European law—known as the acquis communautaire. The NPI aims at consolidating the 
rule of law and democracy, promoting human rights, and enhancing commitments to regional initiatives. 
It also proposes wide-reaching structural reforms to, inter alia, promote a market economy, strengthen 
public financial management, upgrade commercial laws, enhance environmental and agriculture 
standards, and improve the performance of the energy, transport, and infrastructure sectors. 

21. 
The 2009–12 Economic and Fiscal Program (EFP) summarizes macro-fiscal policies aimed 
at fostering sustainable growth and employment by improving economic management, the business 
climate, and labor market skills. This plan calls for prudent fiscal policies with a balanced budget as of 
2012, and an efficient state administration, including strategic use of public private partnerships (PPPs) to 
reduce the State’s fiscal burden. Reforms to the business climate, together with policies and programs 
aimed at supporting SME growth, are identified to attract investments, reduce import dependence, and 
generate employment. To encourage long-term competitiveness, the EFP calls for further modernization 
of the (higher) education system, including through increased alignment with EU standards and business 
needs, as well as greater entrepreneurship and innovation. 

22. 
Implementation of these plans, along with a number of ministerial-level strategies in key 
sectors, is already under way. Objectives established in the NPI have been further developed and 
implemented through medium-term sectoral plans supporting agriculture, the environment, tourism, and 
energy. The EU has been an active and supportive partner, intensified through the establishment of a—
now significant—presence in Podgorica in 2007. The EU Delegation is managing over €100 million in 
assistance to Montenegro under its Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA), an instrument that 
supports the approximation of (potential) candidates to EU standards and their abilities to meet the 
obligations spelt out in the respective SAAs. Other important donors and development partners include 
the bilateral, European, and multilateral institutions.  

10 

 
 
B. 

Key Challenges and Government Strategies 

Strengthening Macroeconomic Stability  

(i) 

Strengthening public finances  

23. 
Montenegro seeks to contain current expenditure both for reasons of post-crisis fiscal policy 
consolidation and to carve out budgetary space for ambitious investment projects. The EFP comprises a 
comprehensive—if ambitious—program of gradual fiscal consolidation, while addressing domestic and 
exogenous risks to the economy. The consolidation is anchored in the objective of a balanced budget by 
2012, with the brunt of the adjustment being borne by current expenditures. Key to the Government’s 
success is the containment of the public-sector wage bill, which the Government has begun in 2009 by (i) 
imposing a hiring freeze; and (ii) increasing social-security contributions so as to reduce net public-sector 
salaries by 3–7 percent. Further reductions are expected through improvements in transparency and 
accuracy, following the centralization of the payroll system and the impact of a new law on civil servant 
wages that will regulate recruitment and introduce part-time work with a reduction in salary of 30 percent. 
It is the Government’s intention to protect capital expenditures—to the extent possible—from the effects 
of the overall fiscal consolidation. The rebalanced composition in the 2010 budget of capital-to-current 
expenditures, to the detriment of the latter, reflects this policy commitment. Contrary to previous years, 
the fiscal strategy includes a “pessimistic” scenario based on the assumption of a deeper, more prolonged 
recession, foreseeing additional adjustments in the wage bill, discretionary spending (including in the 
capital budget), welfare benefits, and—possibly—tax policy. Improvement of efficiency of tax 
administration and increased tax compliance will also further the strengthen revenue collection and 
balance public expenditure efforts. These measures are complemented by efforts to improve further 
public-debt management, with a focus on currency structure and interest rates.  

(ii) 

Increasing financial sector stability and liquidity 

24. 
The crisis revealed the importance of strengthened private-sector confidence in the banking 
system and a reinforced set of policy instruments for the Central Bank of Montenegro (CBCG) to 
ensure the sector’s increasing resilience to future shocks. To this end, Montenegro enacted a set of 
(organic) financial-sector laws—on the CBCG, banks, bank bankruptcy and liquidation, deposit insurance 
fund, and the financial stability council—that has strengthened operational central bank independence. 
Benefiting from input from the Bank and the Fund, the new legislation—as adopted by Parliament—is 
broadly consistent with best international and EU practice, but implementation remains difficult. Above 
all, the Central Bank will need to use its improved mandate to enforce the prudential norms, encourage 
the creation of enhanced capital buffers, and take appropriate supervisory measures for banks of special 
concern. It is important that the regulator’s actions are fully coordinated with, and supported by, the 
Government without jeopardizing the CBCG’s operational independence.  

25. 
A sound financial sector remains a key ingredient to ensuring dynamic and sustainable 
rates of economic growth. Unsustainable rates of credit expansion during the boom period, a high level 
of private-sector indebtedness, and the post-crisis consolidation of bank balance sheets has resulted in 
tight liquidity, an extended credit crunch, and the resultant increase in NPLs. A good tourist season, 
continuously buoyant foreign investments, the return to positive rates of economic growth, together with 
the impact from bank recapitalizations, should help to ease the credit squeeze and normalize the situation 
in the banking sector. For this to happen, it is imperative that the authorities and the banks collaborate to 
improve the quality of credit portfolios and ensure the health of the entire financial sector. The CBCG 
needs to expand the use of risk-based supervision instruments and gradually harmonize its prudential and 
accounting requirements with prevailing international practice. Given the ownership structure of the 
Montenegrin banking sector, cooperation with supervisory authorities in parent banks’ jurisdictions is 

11 

 
 
important. Consolidated supervision of financial groups will become more relevant, given the sector’s 
increasing complexity and diversification. Finally, the cost of credit can be brought down by improving 
the quality and range of services provided by credit and collateral registers.  

Improving Competitiveness and the Business Climate 

26. 
As a euroized economy with large current account deficits, Montenegro has no alternative 
but to implement reforms aimed at increasing international competitiveness, including by ensuring a 
business-friendly (tax) policy environment, good infrastructure, upgraded standards for agriculture, strong 
labor force skills, and mechanisms to encourage innovation. Rather than through currency depreciations, 
innovation and increased productivity are the principal means of growing exports and attracting direct 
investment. To this end, the Government recently passed a competition law to ensure a level playing field 
for all investors and is currently developing the subordinate regulations.  

(i) 

Addressing infrastructure bottlenecks—especially in transport and energy 

27. 
Addressing gaps in infrastructure in an environmentally sustainable manner is a crucial 
element of Montenegro’s drive to reignite growth. Montenegro has paid insufficient attention to 
modernizing and maintaining infrastructure and financing new investments amid growing supply 
constraints and outdated facilities, particularly in energy and transport. A growing energy deficit and an 
increasingly congested and deficient road network, with road safety becoming an increasingly urgent 
challenge, are undermining efforts to promote economic growth, EU-oriented trade, and the full 
development of Montenegro’s tourism market. Institutional capacity and management must be upgraded 
to improve investment planning and operations, particularly given limited fiscal resources for capital 
expenditures. The Government approved a concessions law in 2009 to promote PPPs for infrastructure 
investments too costly to be financed with budgetary revenues.  

28. 
The large-scale energy sector investments and PPPs represent a key engine for growth in 
Montenegro. In recent years, Montenegro has imported up to one-third of its electricity consumption, 
roughly equivalent to the demands from the aluminum company KAP. Government recognizes 
considerable untapped sources of energy production and considerable inefficiencies in energy distribution 
and consumption. To address these challenges, the Government has developed an energy strategy, 
covering the period up until 2025 and calling for massive investments in the construction of new facilities 
in hydro, thermo, and renewable sources of energy (€1.5 billion) and the rehabilitation of existing energy 
infrastructure (€0.3 billion). At present, the Government is developing a PPP project for the development 
of a multi-dam hydropower facility on the Morača River—upstream from Podgorica—that could, on 
average, generate 721 GW/h annually. However, environmental and seismic risk considerations will need 
to be carefully thought through in the development of concrete proposals1. Authorities are also in dialogue 
with foreign investors on possibly leveraging new investments in production capacity into energy exports 
and a source of economic growth. In line with its obligations under the 2005 Energy Community of 
Southeast Europe (ECSEE) treaty, Montenegro has already prioritized market liberalization and enhanced 
transmission connections with neighboring countries in the SEE market, which will increase opportunities 
for cost-effective trade as well as the reliability of the energy supply. In parallel, the Government is 
continuing to address operational and financial constraints in EPCG, such as an inefficient tariff structure, 
overly high subsidies, low collection rates, and weak governance and financial management, which led to 
persistent deficits until recently. Recent reforms to introduce automatic metering, reduce subsidies to 
KAP, which consumes about a third of the Montenegro’s electricity, and unbundle EPCG into separate 
generation, transmission, and distribution lines have improved outcomes.  

1 The Bank carried out a Strategic Environmental Analysis in FY07 on the Government’s National Spatial Plan that 
highlights environmental issues associated with hydropower development, including the Morača project.

29. 
Allocating additional funds to road maintenance and new investments in motorways, 
regional and secondary roads will be a critical factor in facilitating trade links domestically, regionally, 
and internationally. Connecting Montenegro’s road network to the trans-European Corridors would 
ensure producers’ access to markets and increase the value of the Port of Bar as point of entry. At the 
same time, social and economic costs of high incidence rates of road accidents are considerable. Although 
road densities in Montenegro and its SEE neighbors are roughly equal, nearly half of Montenegro’s roads 
are in poor or very poor condition. The quality and extent of Montenegro’s regional highways are also 
insufficient, particularly when compared to requirements of SEE and EU transport plans. Road user taxes 
in Montenegro contribute three times the amount of road expenditures, but road maintenance is 
underfunded. The level of recurrent expenditure to maintain the main and secondary road network in 
“steady-state” condition is typically 60percent more than what is currently allocated. The Government has 
prioritized increasing funds for road maintenance and developed a plan to invest substantially in new road 
investments between 2008 and 2015, including in major regional connections, such as the Bar–Boljare 
and Adriatic–Ionian highways, the former with a link to the trans-European Corridor X.2 However, the 
scale of these investments will require substantial fiscal resources despite the increased employment of 
PPP approaches, which, in turn, implies careful budget planning. At present, the Government is 
considering a number of PPP approaches in the transport sector, including output and performance based 
contracting, and is working with the IFC to structure a PPP for the Bar–Boljare highway. Further work is 
ongoing to strengthen the legal and institutional framework for PPPs in the transport sector and 
mainstream their use in operations. Moreover, the Government is working to improve planning and 
budgeting processes and the institutional capacity of key transport agencies, including the Directorate of 
Public Roads (DPR). Finally, an IFC Investment Climate Advisory Services regional Southeast Europe 
Trade Logistics project, expected to start in FY11 with funding from European Commission IPA funds, 
will work to reduce administrative barriers to trade in both road corridor transport and air transport.  

30. 
Montenegro’s rapid growth in the 2000s was accompanied by an increase in vehicular 
ownership and road accidents, underscoring the need for a comprehensive program to improve road 
safety. Between 2004 and 2007, Montenegro experienced a 40 percent increase in road accidents and 
associated personal damages. The economic cost of traffic accidents in Montenegro is estimated to exceed 
2 percent of GDP—a half point higher than in most middle-income countries. Authorities have prioritized 
upgrading road safety equipment and practices in line with EU standards, and are taking steps to upgrade 
relevant signage and infrastructure. However, assistance is needed to build the technical and institutional 
capacity of relevant road agencies and implement investments and pilot projects. 

(ii) 

Further enhancing the business climate, focusing on property rights, red tape reduction 
and support to SMEs 

31. 
Montenegro has made progress in improving its business climate, but more needs to be 
done at both the central and local levels to streamline business procedures, lessen the regulatory 
burden, and increase labor market flexibility. In line with the NPI and Montenegro’s EU aspirations, the 
Government has approved new laws on land use planning and licensing and a five-year work plan for 
streamlining the real estate cadastre to help reduce red-tape and speed up business registration—a key 

2 Government has made the PPP for the construction of the Bar–Boljare motorway a priority—as an instrument for 
regional development in the poorer Northern regions of the country, to increase the development potential of the 
port of Bar and the hydro energy potential along the Morača River, and to ensure that Montenegro’s road transport 
infrastructure does not remain unconnected to the pan-European road corridors. Contrary to Albania (Corridor VIII), 
Bosnia and Herzegovina (Corridor V), Croatia (Corridors V and X), FYR Macedonia (Corridors VIII and X), and 
Serbia (Corridor VII and X), who are all well-connected to Europe’s main road corridors, Montenegro—without the 
investment into the Bar–Boljare motorway—would remain cut off from all major road transport routes in Europe, 
thereby placing its economy at a comparative disadvantage.  

13 

 
 
 
                                                 
factor in increasing competitiveness. The Government of Montenegro is currently undergoing a 
regulatory guillotine to eliminate unnecessary business regulations; the Government has initiated the 
development of a Regulatory Impact Assessment model that will be put in place in 2011. Reforms have 
started to take root, as suggested by Montenegro’s relative improvements in key rankings of 
competitiveness and business climate (Table 2). To realize further gains, authorities must address several 
challenges, such as limited capacity for innovation, weak technical and administrative skills, continued 
fragmentation of business services, slow construction licensing by municipalities and lack of clarity on 
government responsibilities amid an ongoing program to decentralize service delivery to municipal 
governments.  

32. 
Promoting entrepreneurship and SME growth requires complementary measures to 
promote growth and employment, building on the significant gains achieved between 2006 and 2008. 
Government’s principal goals for SME support include increasing the contribution to GDP of SMEs to 
reach 60 percent, increasing the export orientation of SMEs and increasing employment in SMEs by 20 
percent. Active policy measures to support the achievement of these goals focus on ensuring access to 
credit (including through strengthening the banking system generally as well as the establishment of 
special SME credit lines) and provision of institutional support. Thus far, the latter effort has focused on 
establishing and strengthening regional and local business centers, incubators and technology parks. 
Moreover, Government has put in place a market information service aimed at providing SMEs with 
statistics and other relevant data for increasing their export orientation. Finally, there is an ongoing effort 
to increase access to business studies for young Montenegrins with an initial focus on six secondary 
schools and an education program for “young managers”. 

(iii) 

Strengthening agricultural productivity and standards to capitalize on EU market 
opportunities 

33. 
Upgrading agricultural production processes and food-safety standards to conform with EU 
requirements can increase export earnings considerably and help to raise living standards, especially 
in the poorer rural regions of the country’s mountainous North. Agriculture accounts for about 
10percent of GDP and 70 percent of rural incomes, and over half of the poorest Montenegrin households 
live in rural areas. Despite having abundant water resources, significant agricultural land, a favorable 
climate, and strong demand for agricultural products, Montenegro confronts structural and institutional 
challenges that undermine further growth of the sector. Farming is dominated by small-scale operations 
that produce limited yields owing to insufficient knowledge, outdated technologies, and weak supply 
chains. Investment capital and government extension services are limited, and agriculture institutions and 
practices lack compliance with EU and international standards. Montenegro has significant potential for 
diversifying agricultural activities, particularly to support agri-environmental initiatives and eco-tourism 
in northern regions, which would result in considerable improvements in socio-economic and poverty 
indicators, but such activities require the adoption of new practices and improved alignment with EU 
programs.  

34. 
On an institutional level, Montenegro also needs to improve its capacity to deliver, manage, 
and monitor agricultural assistance, particularly to access grant funding under the EU’s Instrument 
for Pre-accession for Rural Development (IPARD). Montenegro has substantial scope for improving the 
composition and quality of expenditure in the agriculture sector, as well as the technical and 
implementation capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management (MAFWM) and 
other key institutions. In particular, the government aims at upgrading institutions to allow access to 
funding under the IPARD mechanism, which is expected to provide Montenegro with €2.6-6.7 million in 
annual grants once the country becomes an official EU candidate. IPARD grants are expected to help to 
modernize agriculture holdings, improve the rural environment, and support a diversified rural economy, 
while providing targeted support to the EU pre-accession agenda. The Government, with support from the 

14 

 
 
Bank and other donors, is strengthening relevant institutional capacity, including establishing a 
Management Authority within MAFWM, creating an IPARD Payment Agency; and developing systems 
and databases to track IPARD payments. In parallel, the Government is strengthening extension services 
to better reflect the demands and needs of producers.  

Investing in Human Capital  

(i) Strengthen education by increasing efficiency and effectiveness of the public education 
system  

35. 
In recognizing that Montenegro’s competitiveness is highly dependent on the skills of its 
workforce, the Government is seeking to anchor its (higher) education policies into existing European 
frameworks and standards. As a small economy that lacks the ability to excel in all fields, regional and 
Europe-wide exchanges are critical. This, however, can only be achieved if the quality of all levels of 
education is assured—independently, externally, and consistently—so as to ensure that academic degrees 
are recognized internationally. Without fostering the exchange of students and researchers, Montenegro’s 
education system would not be able to meet the demands of the labor market. Already, there is a 
mismatch of skills and a shortage of highly skilled employees that constrains growth and holds back 
socio-economic development.   

36. 
The coverage of secondary and higher education is insufficient and quality improvements 
are needed at all levels. Primary school attendance in Montenegro in 2005 was nearly universal at 98 
percent, and differences were negligible between genders and regions. However, secondary school 
attendance was significantly lower at 84 percent, and only 67 percent of children from poor households 
attended secondary schools. Secondary enrollment was also lower than the national average among 
Bosnian and Muslim groups and in central and northern regions. The Government has embarked on a 
comprehensive program to improve the quality of primary and secondary education, including revising 
curriculums and textbooks, providing teacher training, and improving standardized testing, such as 
Montenegro’s recent participation in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). 
Authorities are also working to expand access by renovating and building schools, especially in the 
poorer, mountainous north where coverage issues are most apparent. Authorities have also focused on 
strengthening planning and budgeting in the education sector, successfully eliminating education deficits 
in recent years. 

37. 
Higher education is critical to cultivating advanced labor skills and competitive businesses, 
but the national system faces funding and institutional constraints, and reforms are needed to align 
practices to EU standards. Montenegro’s higher education system suffers from comparatively high drop-
out and low completion rates and deficiencies in quality and management. The funding model needs a 
significant overhaul to reward high quality teaching and research, and the institutional structure needs to 
be upgraded, especially to build capacity in the Ministry of Education and Science (MoES) and to 
improve management of the University of Montenegro. Academic infrastructure must be modernized and 
instruction standards upgraded in line with the Bologna Accords, which aim to standardize degree and 
quality assurance programs across European universities. Stronger alliances with neighboring countries in 
research, post-graduate training, and quality assurance are also required to ensure Montenegrin students 
and faculty can access internationally relevant instruction and new educational opportunities. 

15 

 
  
 
(ii) Increase capacity for research and development (R&D) in a few niche areas relevant for  
economic growth 

38. 
A key goal established by Government to further growth and competitiveness relates to 
developing and implementing a strategy on R&D to support economic growth within the framework of 
a Western Balkans regional cooperation strategy. Expenditures on R&D in Montenegro amount to less 
than 0.16 percent of GDP, significantly trailing the EU25 average of 1.86 percent. The Government plans 
to clearly delineate national research priorities while allocating more funding for research infrastructure in 
these areas. Priority areas might include tourism, environmental issues and research in agriculture such as 
organic farming. Some other factors inhibiting innovation and R&D in Montenegro as well as other 
Western Balkan countries include deficiencies in the quality of higher education, and poor linkages 
between higher education institutions, R&D centers and private businesses. In addition, small country 
size, inhibits the achievement of minimum efficient size levels required for cost-effective implementation 
of innovation-related activities (e.g., venture capital, agricultural research). In light of these challenges, 
the Montenegrin government has developed a two-pronged strategy for strengthening capacity for 
innovation and R&D, namely: (i) participate in a regional initiative to enable economies of scale and 
increased productivity of local research through enhanced cooperation and specialization at country level; 
(ii) invest domestically in significantly strengthening the quality of higher education and the creation of 
R&D systems to serve as a bridge between businesses and universities in a few areas. Montenegro is 
already a participant in the Western Balkan initiative on R&D launched in Sarajevo in the spring of 2009.  

(iii) Reform and expand access to quality health care 

37. 

Montenegro needs to continue comprehensive reform of health care to improve its 
sustainability and access to care in underserved areas. Thus far, and in part with Bank support under an 
ongoing project, the Government has significantly improved the financial performance of its healthcare 
system by improving controls on pharmaceutical costs and upgrading the legal framework and operations 
of the national Health Insurance Fund (HIF). These and other reforms resulted in a significant decrease in 
the pharmaceutical budget, and the elimination of operating deficits in the HIF in 2008. In addition, 
responding to an inadequate focus on preventive and primary health care (PHC), authorities significantly 
improved PHC services, including revising the PHC benefit package, introducing the concept of choosing 
a PHC doctor, and expanding infrastructure, leading to increased patient satisfaction and a gain in PHC 
utilization rates in Podgorica from 11percent of the population in 2004 to 35percent in 2008. However, 
scope exists for additional improvements in the financial management, capacity, and operations of the 
HIF and key institutions, and expansion of PHC, particularly in rural and northern regions which are 
currently underserved. Montenegro also needs to improve the quality and coverage of secondary and 
tertiary care to complement the expansion of PHC, but the institutional and operational framework is 
relatively deficient. The state’s role in financing secondary and tertiary care needs to be defined along 
with clinical guidelines and standards. In addition, Montenegro must develop contracting arrangements 
between providers and insurers and models of public-private cooperation to support delivery of secondary 
and tertiary care. 

38. 
Two key priorities going forward include strengthening quality assurance programs and 
institutional capacity of the HIF, Ministry of Health (MOH), and the Montenegro Drugs Agency 
(MDA). The MOH’s capabilities in quality assurance are inadequate, and a national strategy needs to be 
developed to improve quality assurance programs at the central and local levels. As part of this effort, 
information channels for financial and medical information need to be strengthened, particularly between 
hospitals and public health facilities and the HIF. Despite undergoing recent capacity building, the MOH, 
HIF, and Institute of Public Health still have insufficient technical and management capacity to scale-up 
ongoing reforms. In particular, the MDA, which is responsible for oversight and regulation of the national 
pharmaceutical market, lacks adequate controls over imported drugs, and its oversight of prescription and 

16 

 
 
consumption practices is insufficient, which continues to undermine cost containment. On a broader level, 
mechanisms need to be developed to permit private doctors and informal providers to enter into payment 
and service contracts with the HIF, which would significantly broaden access to affordable healthcare. 

Improving Environmental Management and Reducing the Cost of Environmental Problems  

(i) Strengthening water supply, sanitation and solid waste management in coastal areas 

39. 
Increased tourism and rapid economic growth in Montenegro’s attractive coastal areas 
have underlined the need for significant improvement in water and solid waste services. Facing threats 
of water shortages from rapid development, the Government and municipalities have invested in a 
regional pipeline network that supplies major coastal municipalities with water from Lake Skadar, a key 
watershed and tourist site bordering Albania about twenty kilometers from the Adriatic Coast. This 
network and complementary investments have significantly improved water connections and the region’s 
water security, though the network may need to be expanded to other less served coastal areas 
commensurate with growth. Inadequate sanitation services and unsanitary disposal in coastal areas have 
led the Government and municipalities to upgrade sanitation infrastructure and strengthen the regulation, 
enforcement, and delivery of solid waste services. Authorities have developed new regional solid waste 
companies, invested in trucks and equipment, and worked to close unsanitary waste sites and increase 
landfill capacity. As a result of these efforts, the percent of solid waste collected and properly disposed of 
in certain major coastal towns increased from 0 percent in 2004 to 65 percent in 2010.  

40. 
Though water services have improved in coastal areas, ensuring the sound management of 
Lake Skadar remains a key challenge to protect its water quality and the development of sustainable 
tourism in the lake valley. Pollution from recent unchecked development around Lake Skadar and 
industrial waste from a nearby aluminum plant pose increasing threats to the lake’s water quality and the 
natural beauty of the region. Overfishing is also a key concern. Given these threats, the Government and 
Albanian authorities have prioritized effective cross-border management of growth, pollution, and 
commercial uses of Lake Skadar. To date, a Lake Commission has been established along with working 
groups on fisheries, hydrology, and other key subjects, and efforts to improve waste disposal of KAP and 
other polluters are ongoing. Providing for strong management of the Lake will be critical to maintaining 
its ecological importance and attractiveness as a vacation destination. 

(ii) Reducing environmental and public health risks associated with industrial pollution  

41. 
Poorly regulated growth in Montenegro over several of the last decades has left a legacy of 
industrial pollution, often in close proximity to population (including tourism) centers. Many disposal 
sites associated with heavy industries such as energy plants, aluminum and steel factories, and shipyards 
have become heavily polluted with ash, lead, chemical, and hazardous waste. Environmental regulations 
on industrial pollution are weak, and disposal and treatment practices are below EU and international 
standards. Existing pollution at these sites, and in some cases the continued unregulated operation of 
polluting industries, poses risks not just to the immediate environment, but to the public and 
environmental health of surrounding communities, including through groundwater contamination and 
other pathways. Montenegro has prioritized remediating the most-heavily polluted sites and strengthening 
regulations and capacity to manage hazardous waste. Montenegro has prepared an extensive list of sites 
for remediation, which typically involve, depending of the findings of site-specific plans, closure and 
capping for sites, water management measures, and/or removal of hazardous waste. The Government 
aims to develop and enforce regulations on separation of hazardous waste and waste categories, and the 
segregated disposal of these waste streams in line with EU directives. Recognizing that disposal options 
for some hazardous waste are limited, the Government is also seeking to construct a new hazardous waste 

17 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
facility in an environmentally suitable location. The establishment of such a facility will require 
development of operational arrangements, including for ownership, tariffs, and overall financial 
sustainability. It will also involve extensive consultation and negotiations with municipal governments, 
citizen groups and other stakeholders in order to proceed in an efficient manner. 

(iii) Insuring against the costs of natural disasters 

42. 
Montenegro is vulnerable to natural and human induced disasters that could cause 
significant suffering and monetary damages, including risks of abrupt climatic shifts. Key natural 
threats include forest fires, flooding, and earthquakes. The Pazicko Polje and the Lim River Valley have 
experienced major flooding events, with two record-breaking floods in January and December 2010, and 
flooding could become more frequent and widespread under predicted climatic shifts. Montenegro is also 
vulnerable to low and medium-intensity earthquakes (Montenegro’s seismological observatory registered 
more than 200 earthquakes in 2009), and occasional major earthquakes with devastating geological 
impacts such as mud and rock slides (such as the one in 1979, which measured 7.0 on the Richter scale). 
The coast and the Zeta-Skadar region are among the areas with the highest seismic activity. In addition, 
Montenegro is exposed to risks of environmental disasters associated with mining and industrial 
activities, including poorly regulated industrial pollution. Climate change is a major concern. Bank 
estimates indicate that by 2100, the Southeast European countries will undergo a mean annual 
temperature increase of 1.8 degrees, and a decrease in precipitation of between 5 and 20 percent. 
Droughts and fires could also become more widespread and intense as the climate grows hotter. Though 
overall precipitation is expected to drop, scientists expect flooding to worsen given more intensive 
precipitation and flash floods.  

43. 
Given increasing disaster and climatic risks, Montenegro is working to upgrade its capacity 
in disaster management and risk reduction, including increasing access to emergency liquidity. The 
Ministry of Interior has developed a broad framework for handling emergency situations, and disaster risk 
management plans were incorporated into the 2006 National Spatial Plan. Montenegro is also pursuing 
comprehensive reforms in disaster management and risk reduction in line EU standards and the Hyogo 
Framework for Action. Montenegro participates in key regional initiatives, including the SEE Disaster 
Risk Mitigation and Adaptation Program, designed to strengthen regional cooperation on, inter alia, risk 
assessment, disaster preparedness, and upgrades to codes, regulations, and legislation. Country-specific 
challenges include, among others, increasing trans-boundary coordination, building municipal capacity in 
disaster mitigation and response, and strengthening legislation on land-use planning and building codes. 
Increasing capacity in firefighting and flood control is also needed, particularly in rural areas. Given the 
potentially dire economic impacts of disasters, the Government also seeks to enhance access of 
individuals and small businesses to insurance, as the current commercial market does not provide 
adequate options. 

Improving the coverage and efficiency of social transfer programs 

44. 
The impact of the crisis and the high share of Montenegrins who are “at risk” of poverty 
emphasize the importance of a strong social safety net, but social assistance in Montenegro has limited 
coverage and certain program designs are inefficient. Montenegro spends about 1percent of GDP on 
social assistance, which is lower than most of its neighbors, including Kosovo, Albania, Serbia, and 
Bosnia and Herzegovina. Categorical benefit programs, which tend to be more susceptible to targeting 
errors, receive roughly the same share of expenditure as means-tested programs in Montenegro. Other 
Western Balkan countries except FYR Macedonia spend greater shares of overall expenditure on 
categorical benefits. The Central Government is responsible for designing, planning, and monitoring 

18 

 
 
 
 
 
social assistance, but local governments implement programs. Last resort social assistance (LRSA) 
programs transfer more than half of their benefits to the poorest quintile, which is on par with Albania and 
FYR Macedonia, but Serbia and Kosovo manage to transfer 70 percent. Coverage of the poorest quintile 
by LRSA programs is relatively low at 15 percent, mainly as inefficient designs channel multiple social 
benefits to the same individuals and families. LRSA programs provide generous benefits in Montenegro 
compared to programs in neighboring states. However, this generosity combined with poor designs and 
strict exclusionary filters may provide disincentives for able bodied adults to work. Further improvements 
in social assistance may require reforms to, inter alia, increase spending on well tested means-tested 
programs, modifying eligibility criteria to remove perverse exclusionary filters, and streamline benefit 
administration. 

45. 
Reform of the public pension system which amounts to 11.8 percent of GDP (2009) is 
another important priority for Montenegro, especially in light of the impact of the 2009 recession on 
both public finances and vulnerable households (many of whom are elderly). While the pension system, 
as currently designed, does a reasonably good job of protecting the elderly against poverty and 
maintaining strong linkages between contributions and benefits, revenues from contributions consistently 
fall below expenditure on benefits. Curtailing the fiscal costs of the system will necessarily involve 
parametric adjustments including constraining entry benefit levels, benefit indexation and, to some extent, 
the inflow of new beneficiaries. Government is fully conscious of the fiscal burden associated with the 
current structure of the pension system and, as a first step, has taken action to channel pension financial 
flows through Treasury as a means of increasing the transparency of inflows and outflows of funds. 
Going forward, it plans to analyze (and eventually implement) various reform options that could help 
contain costs and lessen pressures on the national budget. 

46. 
The preceding discussion of Montenegro’s challenges in key sectors and the strategies that 
Government has developed to address them provides the contextual underpinning for the discussion of 
the program of Bank support under this CPS. The Bank Group’s strategy, developed in close 
coordination with the Montenegrin Government and other stakeholders is laid out in Chapter IV. It 
includes a detailed discussion of expected CPS outcomes and activities following a description of the 
existing portfolio and lessons learned from implementation of the previous CPS.

THE WORLD BANK GROUP STRATEGY 

A. Experience and Lessons Learned 

47.  
 Current Portfolio. Ongoing Bank assistance under the FY07-10 CPS provided selective 
support to three key country priorities: (i) enhancing sustainable macroeconomic growth; (ii) building 
institutions and strengthening the rule of law; and (iii) improving the standard of living for citizens. The 
committed portfolio has grown from five lending operations totaling US$34 million in 2007 to eight 
operations at present, six financed by Bank loans or credits amounting to US$77.2 million and two GEF 
financed-programs totaling US$6.6 million. About 70 percent of these commitments remain to be 
disbursed, as shown in Table 3 below. Investment operations are focused principally on supporting 
programs in the sustainable development and human development sectors.

Portfolio performance has been generally satisfactory, although disbursements fell 
in FY10, largely due to a disruption in implementation support to ongoing operations and the 
slow start-up of new projects. The disbursement ratio in the first three years of the CPS was 
strong and well above the ECA average of 17.8 percent, peaking at 41 percent in FY09, due to 
strong disbursement ratios in several projects before their closure. The disbursement ratio fell to 
11.8 percent in FY10, largely due to a temporary disruption of project implementation support, 
following the en bloc resignation3 in 2009 of staff in the “Technical Services Unit” (TSU) in the 
Ministry of Finance, which handles procurement and financial management for most Bank-
supported operations. The slow—but ultimately successful—re-establishment of the TSU 
reflected relevant skills shortage in this area (in itself a consequence of the fact that, up until 
independence in mid-2006, related activities for donor-financed projects had mostly been 
provided by Belgrade-based institutions). Bank fiduciary experts based in the region will provide 
significant guidance and training to ensure that the new procurement and financial management 
staff in the TSU can effectively handle the demands of portfolio implementation. Most lending 
interventions maintained satisfactory ratings in Implementation Progress (IP) and Development 
Objective (DO) throughout the CPS period, reflecting both concerted efforts by Project 
Implementation Units (PIUs) to overcome implementation hurdles, as well as the strong 
ownership by Government of the projects themselves. Overall performance was affected by 

3 At the time, TSU staff had sought to exploit the scarcity of procurement and financial management (FM) skills in 
the local labor market and requested that personal salaries be paid as function of the number of projects served. Both 
Government and Bank teams rejected this demand. Against the backdrop of more than a year and a half of interim 
arrangements to ensure fiduciary support for the Bank financed projects, alternative arrangements were discussed, 
but, in the end, the Government decided to retain the “centralized” procurement and FM architecture within the 
Ministry of Finance as the most effective setup to (i) assure, under existing constraints of procurement and FM 
expertise, high quality support to Bank-financed projects; (ii) develop local expertise in these areas, including by 
allowing for high impact training to be provided by the Bank; and (iii) reflect the portfolio’s average maturity and 
the expected trend decline in the number of Bank-financed projects. In the re-established TSU, it has been agreed 
that the Senior Procurement Officer serves also as head of unit, who will communicate directly and regularly with 
the Deputy Minister of Finance and, as such, address potential obstacles and delays in a pre-emptive manner.

area. The issues surrounding the landfill were recently resolved and a small additional financing 
(AF) operation was processed to complete its construction.  

Lessons from the CPS Completion Report 

49. 
The FY07–10 CPS Completion Report identified a number of lessons related to the overall 
strategy, project implementation, and Bank and borrower performance that are helping to guide the 
new CPS program. Key lessons are noted below: 
 The CPS’s provision of selective, mutually reinforcing interventions supporting Montenegro’s 
own goals produced solid results, while maximizing the impact of the Bank’s scarce resources. 
Other development partners in Montenegro, such as the EBRD and EIB, have scaled up successful 
Bank financed projects with proven development impacts in, e.g., energy (metering) and solid 
waste management (landfills), while the Government has used scarce budgetary resources to 
complete successfully the regional water supply system, which was initiated with Bank support. As 
a result, the development challenges posed by power outages and interrupted water supply 
(including in the main tourist centers during high season) are being overcome. The portfolio’s 
knowledge products, technical assistance, lending programs, and regional grant programs leveraged 
synergies among World Bank Group institutions (i.e., IBRD and IFC), donors, and domestic 
stakeholders. Analytical products such as the FY07 FSAP and ROSC were particularly valuable in 
diagnosing challenges and developing follow-up TA as well as the proposed development policy 
lending for FY11 and FY12.  
 The Bank’s suite of ESW and analytical reports covering economic and fiscal matters were 
critically important in identifying needed reforms in a newly-independent country, and the 
acquired knowledge helped to identify key areas for follow-up work. The analysis in the FY07 
ROSC, FY09 PEIR, and FY09 PEFA helped to illuminate key challenges and policy 
recommendations, which led to deeper engagement with the Bank on public expenditure 
management and a Government request for follow-up technical assistance. 
 The increase in the number of (relatively small) projects in the Bank’s portfolio by the end of the 
last CPS period have strained Montenegro’s scarce implementation capacity as well as limited 
the Bank’s ability to maintain a robust country-specific AAA program given the need to allocate 
scarce resources to project supervision. Going forward, the Bank should seek to consolidate the 
portfolio focusing on fewer, larger lending interventions. A robust program of AAA will also be 
essential to help build capacity and provide specialized analytical support in key areas. 
 Leveraging regional experiences and programs is important, particularly in a small country with 
limited Bank engagement. To some extent, the Bank’s success in Montenegro was facilitated by 
framing country needs within a regional context, and by leveraging solutions and products that had 
been tested and proven successful in neighboring countries. For example, the Land Administration, 
Energy Efficiency and Agriculture Institutions projects were all modeled on successful IBRD 
operations in neighboring countries. Similarly, the Government’s decision to retain IFC as an 
advisor on the Bar-Boljare motorway and the Morača Hydropower project was partly motivated by 
IFC’s success in the energy sector in Albania. The Bank and IFC should continue to leverage 
regional programs and experiences whenever possible. 
 Careful assessment and monitoring of the interests of government agencies and local 
stakeholders are critical during project preparation and implementation, particularly when 
operations involve different levels of government. Complications in MSTDP and MESTAP were 
partly driven by the Bank’s underassessment of diverging views on project goals among 

21 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
municipalities, stakeholders, and central government. Close monitoring of interests and open 
communications between the Bank and stakeholders at all levels of government are crucial to avert 
project implementation issues downstream.  
 Though the continued use of the Technical Services Unit (TSU)—a central unit providing 
financial management and procurement services to most Bank-financed operations—reflects the 
extreme shortage of these implementation skills in Montenegro. Improved oversight of its 
operations is needed to avoid project delays. The use of a central TSU entails some risks deriving 
from the TSU’s isolation from line ministries and PIUs, the difficulties of prioritizing among 
competing demands from “client” projects, and the risk of paralysis across several projects in the 
event of a major staff turnover as occurred in mid-2009. To mitigate these issues, the government 
and the Bank are trying to improve the stability and operations of the TSU through introducing 
periodic workload and staffing assessments, and improving communications between the TSU and 
project beneficiaries. 
Box B: Country Systems in Public Financial Management and Procurement 

Montenegro has made progress in establishing an effective and transparent public financial management 
(PFM) system. Montenegro’s introduction of a single treasury account in 2002 greatly improved budget and 
cash management, and clear gains have been made in budget planning and the transparency and accuracy of 
budget documentation. Internal controls are being strengthened in line with EU standards, notably by 
establishing a Central Harmonization Unit within the MOF and improving the internal audit capability of 
spending units. Montenegro has established the State Audit Institution (DRI) and provided for enhanced 
Parliamentary oversight of public expenditure via its Budget and Finance Committee. However, there is scope 
for further improvement across many areas of public financial management including comprehensiveness of the 
budget, multi-year budgeting, commitment control, cash and debt management, internal financial reporting, 
internal audit and financial management control, external audit coverage and legislative scrutiny of DRI reports. 

Notable advances were also made in public procurement. Montenegro enacted a new public procurement law 
in 2006 that harmonizes key practices with EU directives. In line with this law, two agencies were established: a 
Public Procurement Administrative Authority (PPAA), which sets regulations and issues tenders; and a Public 
Procurement Commission (PPC), which hears complaints and appeals. This law more clearly defines 
responsibilities and procedures, requires publication of contract awards on the web, and incorporates new 
regulations on anti-corruption and conflicts of interest. However, supplementary regulations and bidding 
documents still need to be updated in line with best practice, and capacity of the PPC needs strengthening to 
better manage the complaints process. Internal and external audits also need to be expanded to strengthen the 
overall control framework. Training of contracting staff and capacity building of contracting institutions will 
also be needed  

Complementing these gains, Montenegro has taken steps to reduce the risk of corruption in the public sector. 
The Government established an Anti-corruption Agency in 2001, which was renamed the Directorate for Anti-
corruption Initiatives in 2003. In 2006, the Government finalized an Anti-corruption Action Plan that calls for, 
inter alia, studies on the scope of corruption, improved monitoring of anti-corruption activities, and whistle-
blowing. In 2010, Montenegro adopted an Action Plan for Fighting Corruption and Organized Crime aligned 
with EU standards. Anti-corruption efforts have focused mainly on the financial sector. Montenegro stands to 
reap considerable wins in anti-corruption by improving the enforcement of existing laws. 

Montenegro’s progress on strengthening PFM and procurement systems, may permit consideration of 
piloting the use of some aspects of country systems for Bank projects during the next CPS period. A 2007 
study indicated that Montenegro fully met only one of six key prerequisites for use of country systems: 
establishment of an efficient treasury system. However, the 2009 PEFA suggests that Montenegro has continued 
to make progress, particularly in external auditing. If country capacity continues to increase, the Bank will 
consider piloting the use of some aspects of country systems during the FY11-14 CPS period. However, efforts 
to pilot country system will be gradual, with due attention to advancements in internal controls and the 
availability for adequately skilled staff for financial management and procurement. In the meantime, the Bank 
will continue to strengthen the capacity of the reconstituted TSU to help ensure smooth implementation of 
Bank-financed operations.

Partnerships and Consultations  

50. Donor assistance in Montenegro has been dominated by funding from European institutions, 
including assistance through the EU IPA mechanism, though other international and bilateral donors 
also provide support in specific areas. In 2009, the EIB approved contracts of €111 million to 
Montenegro to strengthen transport and solid waste infrastructure and provide credit lines for SME 
growth. The EBRD supports an active portfolio of €206 million through 21 projects, mainly in energy and 
transport infrastructure. Montenegro’s funding from IPA and EC sources equaled nearly US$60 million in 
2008, and assistance was directed at virtually all development sectors. The Bank remains an important 
player with annual disbursements averaging US$7.7 million during FY07–FY09 as discussed above. 
More modest funding is provided from other international institutions, including the United Nations 
Development Program (UNDP), which supports projects in health, infrastructure, and the environment. 
The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria has also been active in Montenegro, 
providing US$1.5 million in 2008. Key bilateral donors include, inter alia, Germany, France, and the 
United States, have also engaged in a number of sectors including infrastructure, water and sanitation, 
health, school construction loan guarantees for infrastructure investments, and social protection.  

51. 
Montenegro is also benefiting from a number of TFs managed by the Bank, and which are 
fully aligned with the country partnership program. There are two GEF grants, one which complements 
the Bank’s Agriculture Institutional Development Project (US$4.00 million) and another for the 
environmental management of Lake Skadar, which is supportive of the CPS program for improvement of 
water supply in the coastal zone. In addition, several multi-donor TFs have been made available in 
support of Western Balkan regional analytic work which will benefit Montenegro in a number of areas: (i) 
land rights and access for women; (ii) science, R&D and innovation; and (iii) accounting standards in the 
private and public sectors; (iv) public financial management; and (iv) Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility. 
The work supported by these TFs will continue during the FY11-14 CPS period and is fully integrated 
with the CPS program as shown in the description of CPS-supported activities described later in this 
chapter. Details of each of the TFs and the amounts allocated are included in Annex 4. Grant funding is 
also being sought from the Russia Public Expenditure Management TF to support Montenegro’s ongoing 
effort to increase the efficiency and impact of public expenditures in a resource constrained environment.  

52. Going forward, as Montenegro has been granted candidate status, the EU’s presence can be 
expected to become even stronger, making it imperative that the Bank and other donors coordinate 
their programs more systematically with the EU and the EU accession agenda. Substantial EU pre-
accession funds will be available to Montenegro as the country’s institutions become stronger and are 
able to absorb the funds in an effective manner. The Bank has coordinated closely and aligned its 
activities with the EU (agriculture and education), the EIB (solid waste), EBRD (energy), and Germany’s 
GtZ (energy efficiency) but not jointly implemented projects or engaged in fee-for-service activities. The 
expected gradual increase in the availability of EU funds (once its institutions will have been placed into a 
position to absorb these funds), joint with a concomitant (gradual) withdrawal of bilateral donors, will 
place the Bank in a more central role as provider of technical expertise and financial support in areas that 
are complementary to EU accession priorities. As a result, the draft CPS priorities have been discussed 
with both, domestic counterparts and development partners, as well as with the Delegation of the EU in 
Montenegro and the European Commission, with a view to assessing, to which degree the programming 
and implementation of support can be aligned across institutions, thereby increasing the degree of results 
orientation and development impact.

Areas of Engagement 

B. Priorities for the FY11–FY14 CPS 

53. 
The FY11–FY14 CPS is client driven and reflects Montenegro’s status as an upper middle 
income client with well-defined development priorities. Based on the outcome of extensive consultations 
with the Montenegrin Government, other domestic stakeholders and external partners, the focus of Bank 
interventions under the CPS will fall under two main priority areas as follows:  
 Priority 1: Strengthen institutions and competitiveness in line with EU accession requirements 
 Priority 2: Improving environmental management, including reducing the costs of environmental 
problems 
To the extent that the CPS is being prepared at a time when Montenegro is striving to recover from the 
deep recession it suffered following the global financial crisis, activities under priority 1 will aim to 
address both immediate issues related to restoring macro balances and medium-term issues related to 
putting in place stronger, EU-aligned institutions and sharpening Montenegro’s competitive advantages in 
the integrated EU market. At Government’s request the Bank will focus its support in areas where the 
Bank has previously been engaged in Montenegro and/or gained applicable regional or global experience. 
The centerpiece of the Bank’s engagement will be two financial-sector development policy loans (about 
US$105 million, total in FY11 and FY12) which will support a banking sector strengthening and 
stabilization program, bring regulations into line with EU norms, and encourage resumption of (healthy) 
credit growth. New investment lending in roughly the same amount will be very selective, given existing 
resource constraints under the new exposure framework, the country’s limited implementation capacity, 
and the substantial portfolio of operations under implementation (about US$55 million still to be 
disbursed)4. At present, new investment lending is planned for a Higher Education/ R&D project (FY12), 
a small investment to facilitate Montenegrin participation in a Regional Catastrophe Risk Insurance 
Facility (FY12), and a Hazardous Waste Clean-up and Management Project (FY13). An additional project 
could be included for FY14 depending on client demand and timely closure of projects in the existing 
portfolio (see Table 5). IFC is expected to provide advisory services to help improve the business climate 
and country competitiveness, and make new investments in private companies as opportunities arise. The 
expected level of support will be on the order of US$40–50 million over the CPS period.  

54. 
The Bank’s interventions will contribute to specific development outcomes that are 
integral to Government’s broader development program. For much of the CPS period, contributions 
towards these outcomes will come mainly from the existing portfolio of projects, all of which are 
fully supportive of the two priorities identified above. Of the new lending proposed under this CPS, 
outcomes associated with development policy lending or DPLs and most TA and analytical work 
should also be fully achieved during the CPS period. However, the full impact of proposed new 
investment operations cannot realistically be achieved within the CPS time frame and will become 
apparent only in the next CPS period. Table 4a below provides a breakdown of ongoing and planned 
lending operations. Knowledge and advisory activities for the FY11–FY14 CPS are shown in Table 
4b.  

4 . While there is no new Bank-financed project that is explicitly designed to address gender issues (see Annex 
3),several ongoing operations monitor and seek to increase women’s access to health care, education, pension 
benefits, and land titles. The latter issue, included in the Land Administration and Management Project, is 
particularly important as land titles represent the principal collateral for bank loans and, as such, would open the 
doors for increased female entrepreneurship.

Planned lending during the CPS period is underpinned by AAA activities carried out over 
the past 2-3 years and new AAA activities (both country-specific and regional) are targeted to key CPS 
areas with the aim of supplementing the lending program in the effort to achieve specified CPS 
outcomes.  Design of each of the major lending activities foreseen for the CPS period builds on recently-
completed or ongoing AAA activities. For example, the FY08 FSAP and follow-up knowledge and 
advisory services in FYs 10-11 have helped shape the FSDPLs. Regional analytical work on higher

education (FY08), as well as the education-sector policy dialogue established in the context of the FY05-
09 Education Reform Project, and ongoing TA support to the Western Balkans initiative on Science, 
R&D and Innovation underpin the planned Higher Education/R&D project. Similarly, the Environmental 
“Hot-Spots” Clean-up Project is informed by analytical work and feasibility studies undertaken under the 
Lake Skadar GEF operation which is currently ongoing. New country-specific and regional AAA planned 
under the CPS is targeted to improved public expenditure management and institutional development in 
key areas related to EU integration. Regional AAA also serves to help nurture and promote regional 
integration in sectors where Western Balkan Governments have themselves spearheaded regional 
initiatives, and where regional approaches are more cost effective and/or successful implementation 
requires regional cooperation.

Strategic Objectives and Results 

Priority 1: Support EU accession through strengthening institutions and competitiveness 

56. 
In support of Government’s overarching objective of full integration with the EU within a 
medium-term time horizon, the Bank expects to concentrate its support on the achievement of stronger, 
“EU-compatible” institutions in areas central to Montenegro’s longer-term competitiveness in the 
integrated EU market. In this regard, the Bank Group’s interventions are aimed at achieving key 
outcomes in seven areas as follows: (i) financial (especially banking) sector strengthening; (ii) improve 
public expenditure management; (iii) business climate enhancement including simplification of trade and 
tax procedures; (iv) overhauling of agriculture support capacity; (v) strengthening higher education and 
capacity for R&D and innovation; (vi) strengthening of the health system; and (vii) increased efficiency 
in the use of energy and accelerated integration into the SEE market. The extent of Bank involvement 
with respect to each of these seven outcome areas is not planned to be uniform – e.g., the Bank’s support 
for financial sector strengthening or higher education/R&D/innovation is expected to be relatively 
comprehensive, while support for solid waste will be—as currently conceived—considerably more 
focused. The following paragraphs provide more detail about the specific results that the CPS program 
will influence and about the instruments through which Bank support will be provided.  

57. 
CPS Outcome: A stronger banking system governed by a modern regulatory framework and 
central institutions, which is more resilient to future shocks. The centerpiece of the Bank’s engagement 
under the CPS is a program of two Financial Sector Development Policy Loans (FSDPLs) -- for $85 
million and $20 million in FY11 and FY12 respectively -- that would support measures to strengthen the 
banking sector, with a view to mitigating the impact of the global financial crisis and increasing the 
resilience of the sector to future shocks. On a general level, the FSDPLs will also support the 
Government’s aims to maintain a stable macroeconomic framework over the short to medium-term, 
including sustainable deficit and debt levels. Design of the FSDPLs is underpinned by a joint IBRD-IMF 
FSAP report and intensive policy dialogue, advisory services and TA in support of both the MOF and 
Central Bank authorities. Specific outcomes associated with the two FSDPLs are detailed below given 
that the program constitutes over half the CPS lending envelope along with key reforms linked to 
disbursement:  

 Enhanced market confidence. The proposed FSDPLs would help reverse a decline in deposits 
precipitated by eroding confidence in Montenegrin banks during the economic crisis, and to restore 
lending to the private sector. The proposed operations will support the transition from the blanket 
deposit guarantee to an increased ceiling for mandatory coverage which is fiscally and economically 
viable. Assistance will also help to strengthen the liquidity of Deposit Protection Fund in the event of a 
crisis by, inter alia, establishing a legal framework for mobilizing external resources, and improving 
its capacity to execute deposit payouts. 

 A strengthened bank liquidity framework. To reduce risks of financial destabilization due to low bank 
liquidity, the FSDPLs aim to boost liquidity in the banking sector mainly by strengthening the Central 
Bank’s (CB) independence and role as a Lender of Last Resort (LOLR). Specific reforms include 
diversifying instruments for LOLR operations; expanding the sources of funding available to the CB; 
and augmenting the collateral to be used by CBCG for liquidity support. 

 Stronger capacity for bank supervision. The FSDPLs will build capacity to assess the health of banks 
and supervise financial institutions with a view to pro-actively reducing systemic risks. Previous Bank-
supported examinations of Montenegrin banks will be complemented by stress-testing of the banking 

27 

 
 
 
 
 
system as a whole, taking into account baseline and worst-case scenarios. The CB will use the results 
of these tests to develop and implement appropriate supervisory responses for individual banks and a 
contingency plan for the banking sector. Supervision capacity will be strengthened in line with EU 
standards, and improved supervision is expected promote improvements in key banking indicators, 
such as ratios of liquidity and capital adequacy.  

 A modern regulatory framework consistent with EU norms. The FSDPLs will support regulatory 
improvements to strengthen the CB’s ability to conduct the risk-based supervision and resolution of 
problem banks. The proposed operations will, inter alia, support amendments to the Law on Banks 
  that strengthen the CB’s capacity to impose remedial actions, establish statutory protection for the CB,    
  and better define the scope of courts’ powers on arbitration. In addition, the amendments to the Law     
  on Bank Bankruptcy and Liquidation will enhance the CB’s ability to undertake timely enforcement   
  measures vis-à-vis problem banks. 

 Adequate resolution of problem banks. The recent crisis exposed the extreme vulnerability of at least 
one domestic bank of systemic importance. The FSDPLs will support the design and implementation of 
a least cost restructuring strategy for this bank. The large fiscal risks presented by the bank’s heavy 
reliance on deposits from state and state-controlled entities will also be addressed.  

58. 
Further support to the strengthening and deepening of the financial sector will be provided 
through Bank advisory services for the financial sector which will complement the DPL program and 
through IFC’s regional programs in the SEE. Within the context of the programmatic Western Balkans 
Financial Sector Development AAA (FY11–FY14) the Bank will provide assistance in identifying and 
addressing remaining financial system vulnerabilities and removing obstacles to the expansion of 
financial markets. Specifically, support will be provided: (i) to the central bank in drafting regulations to 
implement the newly-amended Banking Law in areas of bank supervision and problem bank resolution; 
(ii) to the Deposit Protection Fund in implementing the new Law on Deposit Insurance, including training 
of staff and drafting of internal regulations; and (iii) to review Prva restructuring strategy to be prepared 
jointly by CBM and MoF. IFC may provide targeted financial assistance to raise bank liquidity, as well as 
advisory services to banks and financial institutions to help restore credit to the private sector with a 
special focus on SMEs.  

59. 
CPS Outcome: Improved public expenditure management. As discussed in Chapters II and 
III, the recent recession, from which Montenegro is just beginning to recover, led to a severe contraction 
in public revenues and a substantial deterioration in the country’s budget deficit and public sector 
indebtedness in 2009. To reverse this situation, Government has developed a medium-term framework for 
strengthening public finances involving actions to gradually curb spending (particularly recurrent 
expenditures) and improve the management of public debt. To help support this effort, the Government 
has requested that the CPS program include a Public Expenditure and Investment Review (PEIR) for 
completion in FY11 to help identify areas for achieving savings through efficiency improvements in 
transfer programs (pensions, social assistance) and social services (education, health). This PEIR follows 
an earlier expenditure review (FY09) which concentrated on reviewing expenditures in the infrastructure 
sector. The FY11 social sectors PEIR will be followed in FY12 by TA to improve management of the 
pension system, which represents a major fiscal burden as previously discussed. [Grant funding is also 
being sought from the Russia Public Expenditure Management TF to support Montenegro’s ongoing 
effort to increase the efficiency and impact of public expenditures in a resource constrained environment]. 
In addition, an assessment of selected public sector institutions and fiduciary practices would be 
undertaken in FY13 with the aim of identifying means of further increasing the transparency and 
efficiency of public financial management and procurement. The study will follow an ongoing AAA for 
improving public financial management in the Western Balkans financed by an EC trust fund. Finally, to 
support improved targeting of public expenditures and strengthen policy decisions the Bank will also help 

28 

 
 
 
 
strengthen the statistical capacity of the Montenegrin Government with a particular emphasis on 
monitoring poverty, living standards and gender.  

60.  
CPS Outcome: Creating an enhanced climate for business investment. Montenegro’s overall 
economic policy stance is strongly pro-business but there are a number of bottlenecks (regulatory and 
institutional) on a practical level that need to be addressed to further encourage investment, including in 
the SME sector. Bank Group support under the FY11-14 CPS will assist Government’s efforts to address 
them in a few selected areas. First, financial support and TA under the FY09 Land Administration Project 
(LAMP) will help provide clarity around land use and property registration through development of 
updated national and base maps in the Real Estate Administration Department (READ), and completion 
of detailed urban maps in Montenegro’s municipalities. The maps are critically important to strengthening 
land management and planning for sustainable growth, especially the development of sustainable tourism 
markets. Second, support from LAMP and the IFC’s Investment Climate Advisory Services and Doing 
Business Reports will help to identify opportunities for reducing red tape for businesses and assist in 
simplifying procedures for construction permits, administrative procedures, and business permits 
including initiation of a Regulatory Impact Assessment. Third, technical advisory services from the 
regional Road to Europe Program of Accounting Reform and Institutional Strengthening (REPARIS) will 
assist Montenegro and other countries in the region set and implement standards to upgrade key business 
accounting practices to EU standards. A Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) is planned for FY13 
that will take a more comprehensive approach to identifying and analyzing factors affecting business 
growth and competitiveness in the evolving post-crisis environment and recommend appropriate policy 
responses for Government’s consideration. Finally, IFC Investment Climate Advisory Services will 
explore the potential of working in Montenegro on tax administration simplification and insolvency. 

61. 
CPS Outcome: Enhanced institutional capacity to support adoption of EU standards in 
agricultural production and increased agricultural exports to the EU. Progress towards this outcome is 
being supported by the Bank via the FY09 Montenegro Institutional Development and Agriculture 
Strengthening (MIDAS) Project, which will remain under implementation throughout the FY11-14 CPS 
period. The MIDAS project and an associated GEF program were designed to improve compliance with 
EU agricultural standards as well as strengthen institutional capacity to provide agro-environmental 
services to Montenegrin farmers, thus enabling them to access EU grant funds to improve their 
operations. Thus far, steps have been taken toward establishing an IPARD-compatible payment agency, 
and accreditation and capacity building activities are in progress for agencies and laboratories concerned 
with food safety, veterinary care, and enforcement of phyto-sanitary standards. In addition, specialists are 
being hired to increase the coverage of extension and advisory services in agro-environmental issues. 
Going forward, MIDAS will also help authorities to improve the effectiveness of extension services, raise 
agriculture and food safety standards to those of the EU, and diversify agriculture activities, including 
agri-environmental measures in northern regions. The project has also supported implementation of 
Montenegro’s first Agricultural Census in 40 years, which will underpin future development of the 
national rural development program. A proposed Bank analytical report assessing the agriculture sector 
(FY14) will also help review progress and define recommendations for future sectoral development. 

62. 
CPS Outcome: Higher education quality has been strengthened and made more cost 
effective and capacity for R&D and innovation in cooperation with the private sector has been 
established in a few niche areas relevant for Montenegro's growth. Developing higher-level labor force 
skills and targeted capacity for R&D is a key government goal in view of Montenegro’s need to compete 
effectively in the sophisticated EU market. Building on analytical work on higher education in the 
Balkans (FY08) and an ongoing policy dialogue and conference program on higher education, the 
Montenegrin Government and the Bank are beginning to develop a Higher Education and R&D project 
($20 million) for Board presentation in FY12. The proposed project will strengthen quality assurance in 
higher education in line with the Bologna Process, and increase the financial sustainability of tertiary 

29 

 
education. In addition, it will seek to strengthen R & D and increase its links to private business in areas 
such as tourism, agriculture and environmental science where Montenegro has clear comparative 
advantages. While the project is still at an early concept stage, possible activities on the education side 
would include reform of curricula to incorporate Bologna standards, reform of incentives to reward high 
quality teaching and instruction and improved management of higher education by the Ministry of 
Education and Science (MoES). With respect to strengthening R&D capacity linked to areas of 
Montenegro’s established comparative advantage, the project will build on strategies identified via an 
ongoing Western Balkan initiative to cooperate across the region on business-relevant R&D. This 
regional initiative, in which Montenegro is already an active participant, is receiving ongoing Bank 
support through a TF-financed AAA initiative to help countries arrive at a common regional strategy for 
R&D and innovation through a program of meetings, learning visits to relevant countries and TA for 
policy development and implementation. 

63. 
CPS Outcome: Creation of a more sustainable health care system and improvements in the 
quality of, and access to, health care. Bank support under the FY04 Health Systems Improvement 
Project (HSIP) has helped to rationalize expenditures and improve the financial status of the HIF. A new 
primary health care benefit package was introduced and overall patient satisfaction with PHC services has 
dramatically improved. An AF was approved in FY10, which will continue to identify cost savings and 
improve financial management, especially by improving pharmaceutical management, while expanding 
PHC reforms and services in underserved northern regions. The AF will also support a needed expansion 
of secondary and tertiary care. 

64. 
CPS Outcome: Enhanced cross-border energy trade and more regular energy supply within 
Montenegro. The FY08 ongoing ECSEE Adaptable Program Loan 3 will influence achievement of the 
above outcome by investing in an optical ground wire connection with Serbia to better manage the cross-
border energy trade and strengthen the energy system’s resilience to power interruptions. The project will 
also support the completion of infrastructure investment activities supporting improved operations of the 
Peruica hydropower plant, with a view to decreasing power losses and thereby helping to increase the 
regularity of power supplies. In addition, IFC, which is providing advisory services in relation to the 
structuring of a PPP project for a major hydropower investment on the Morača river will continue to 
explore the viability of attracting private investment in EPCG (the state-owned electricity company) and 
developing PPPs for existing energy sector operations, which could help improve service quality as well 
as alleviate the high fiscal burden of the utility’s operations. The Bank undertook a Strategic 
Environmental Assessment (FY07) of Montenegro’s National Spatial Plan which points to a number of 
environmental considerations which will need to be taken into account in the development of hydro 
power and other energy investments.  

Priority 2: Improving environmental management and reducing the costs of environmental 
problems 

65. 
The second priority area for which the Government is seeking Bank Group support under 
the FY11-14 CPS concerns improved environmental management. Specific outcomes to be supported 
through CPS activities focus on four main areas: (i) efficient solid waste management and disposal; (ii) 
remediation of toxic industrial waste dumps; (iii) provision of insurance against risk associated with 
natural disasters; and (iv) energy efficiency. These outcomes and the associated CPS instruments are 
described below.  

66. 
CPS outcome: improved solid waste collection and disposal in heavily populated and 
economically-important coastal areas. Ongoing and planned IBRD lending and IFC investments in 
municipal sanitation projects will continue to improve solid waste management and disposal services in 
coastal areas to respond to rapid growth. The FY04 MESTAP project and the FY11 Additional Financing 

30 

 
 
project ($5.7 million) supports the development of a regional sanitary landfill serving the major coastal 
cities of Bar and Ulcinj as well as the operations of a new regional sanitation company. This assistance 
from the World Bank Group, together with a parallel EIB project supporting a regional landfill for Korot, 
Tivat, and Budva, is expected to improve sanitary waste collection and disposal in coastal areas. This, in 
turn, will enhance the quality of life for coastal residents and enable the further expansion of tourism in 
the covered municipalities.  

67. 
CPS Outcome: improved trans-boundary cooperation on shared environmental issues and 
strengthened institutions to allow the development of sustainable tourism in the lake valley. The 
ongoing Lake Skadar project, financed through a GEF grant of $4.6 million (of which $2.6 million is 
allocated to Montenegro), is helping the Governments of Montenegro and Albania to improve the 
management of Lake Skadar to halt and reverse some of the effects of pollution derived from industrial 
waste associated with a nearby aluminum plant (KAP). The project is also helping to strengthen 
Montenegro’s capacity to prepare for the requirements of the EU Industrial Pollution Prevention and 
Control Directive using the KAP site as a pilot area. The project will also help assess the feasibility of 
rural wastewater treatment through constructed wetlands. 

68. 
CPS outcome: environmental risks have been reduced at about 3-4 major industrial waste 
disposal sites and the capacity to manage hazardous waste has been enhanced. Through a proposed 
FY13 Hazardous Waste Clean-up and Management Project (US$60 million), the Bank will help to reduce 
the environmental and public health risks associated with Montenegro’s legacy of industrial pollution, 
mainly by remediating industrial waste disposal sites and increasing capacity to manage hazardous waste. 
Building on analytic work undertaken under the Lake Skadar GEF project, this proposed project will 
support remediation of the most heavily polluted sites prioritized by the Government, particularly in the 
energy and metal sectors, which may involve closure and capping of polluted sites, water management 
measures, and removal of hazardous waste. In this regard, a key focus will be addressing issues of red 
sludge associated with waste from the KAP aluminum plant. The project will also support the 
development a national hazardous waste disposal facility and associated regulations on segregating waste 
disposal streams in line with EU directives. TA and capacity building will help to define arrangements for 
managing the hazardous waste disposal facility, including institutional parameters such as its ownership, 
management structure, and tariff schedule. 

69. 
CPS outcome: better insurance coverage for Montenegrin businesses and households in the 
event of a natural or climatic disaster. The Bank plans to provide investment support to facilitate 
Montenegro’s participation in the Regional Southeastern Europe and Caucasus Catastrophe Risk 
Insurance Facility (SEEC CRIF). The objective of the SEEC CRIF is to increase access to financial 
protection for the Government as well as homeowners, farmers and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) 
from losses due to weather extremes caused by climate change and relevant geo-hazards, such as 
earthquakes, landslides, droughts, floods, etc. The Government has requested the Bank to provide a small 
(US$5 million) loan to finance Montenegro’s participation in this regional facility. 

70. 
CPS outcome: reduced energy wastage in public buildings and better environment for users 
of the facilities. Through the ongoing FY09 Energy Efficiency Project, the CPS will support improved 
energy efficiency in public sector buildings through energy-saving retrofits. Recognizing that the carbon 
footprint and energy costs associated with public sector facilities were high, the Government has worked 
with the Bank to retrofit select public schools and hospitals. Project-supported retrofits, which generally 
target insulation and other aspects of building envelopes, also help to improve the ambient environment of 
buildings, thereby enhancing overall living conditions.

C. The Lending Program 

71. 
The proposed lending program for CPS FY11-14 is summarized below. As previously 
mentioned, projects in the outer years have not been specified at this stage to allow flexibility to adapt the 
program to emerging needs. Up to two additional operations may be included at Government’s request 
within the general priority areas laid out in this CPS. If such requests are made, the rationale for any new 
operation(s) and the amounts would be laid out in detail in the CPS Progress Report to be prepared in 
early FY13.

*Macro situation is subject to risk which could prevent moving ahead  
with the DPL, in which case loan amounts would be transferred to investment  
projects as appropriate and the Board would be updated via the CPS PR.  

V.  RISKS  

72. 
Implementation of the CPS program identified in the previous chapter is subject to five main 
risks as follows: 

 Slower than expected growth in the SEE and the EU could dampen Montenegro’s economic 
recovery and exacerbate fiscal vulnerabilities. As a small, open economy, Montenegro’s growth 
hinges strongly on resuming strong exports and maintaining FDI flows—with promising signs in both 
areas to date. However, although economic growth in 2011 is expected to reach 1.8 percent in EU 
economies and between 2.5 to 4.0 percent in SEE countries, the fiscal strain of country stimulus 
packages, increasing sovereign debt, weak regional financial performance, and lower-than-expected 
global growth could negatively affect foreign investment and demand for Montenegrin exports. In 
turn, this could thwart recovery, reduce fiscal revenues, and increase Montenegro’s already-high debt. 
To partially mitigate these risks, the CPS proposes several analyses, studies and advisory services 
(e.g., FY11 PEIR, FY13 CEM) to support the Government in its efforts to address evolving economic 
and fiscal risks and design and implement effective policy responses. Further, the proposed FY11 and 
FY12 FDPLs support maintenance of a viable macroeconomic framework. 

32 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Ongoing weaknesses in the banking sector could increase financial instability and constrain credit 
just as Montenegro seeks to reignite private sector-led growth. Montenegro took steps to protect its 
banking system during and after the economic crisis by, inter alia, enhancing deposit protections and 
the role and independence of the Central Bank. However, continued high shares of non-performing 
loans and the fragile state of financial institutions, particularly Prva Bank, underline solvency risks 
while reducing the capacity of banks to lend to the private sector. Though foreign owned banks have 
injected new capital into many Montenegrin subsidiaries, portfolio quality is still an issue and banks 
remain vulnerable to external shocks. The proposed FY11 and FY12 DPLs support policy measures 
to mitigate key risks, mainly by strengthening the liquidity framework, developing instruments to 
resolve problem banks, and improving banking sector regulations. 

 Lack of progress on institutional strengthening and governance improvements could undermine 
Montenegro’s path toward EU Accession and its efforts to attract increasing FDI flows. EU and 
domestic observers have raised concerns about possible links between some senior public officials 
and organized crime. Perceptions among EU and international investors that Montenegro is not fully 
tackling these issues could stall progress on EU integration, thereby reducing the country’s 
attractiveness as an investment and tourist destination. The EC’s set of prior actions to be completed 
before opening EU membership negotiations has sought to reflect these concerns, with clear signs 
from the Government that related reform priorities would be addressed. The Bank can offer some 
assistance in diagnosing and addressing broader governance-related issues, which will be provided 
through AAA activities, such as the PEIR, the proposed advisory services in the business 
environment and the institutional and fiduciary assessment. 

 The quality of the portfolio could be impaired by deficiencies in country implementation capacity. 
The 2009 breakdown of the TSU highlighted risks that unexpected personnel shifts or other 
organizational deficiencies could interrupt procurement or implementation support for Bank projects, 
leading to delays on project outputs and outcomes. In addition, the relative inexperience of certain 
line ministries in processing Bank projects could negatively affect project execution. To ensure 
adequate fiduciary support, the Bank has significantly strengthened its oversight of the TSU, 
including by undertaking annual assessments of the TSU workload and staffing, and strengthening 
communications between TSU staff and project beneficiaries. The Bank has also enhanced its 
engagement with PIUs in line ministries to ensure the transfer of adequate knowledge on Bank 
standards and procedures. 

 Montenegro is vulnerable to natural disasters, including, increasingly, severe climate 
pressures. A significant proportion of Montenegro’s land area and population are vulnerable to 
multiple natural hazards associated with climate change pressures. The prevalence of both floods 
and droughts is expected to increase with detrimental impacts on households and possible 
negative effects on tourism and agriculture, and hence, economic growth. To help mitigate the 
impact of such natural phenomena on the Montenegrin population and businesses, the Bank will 
support the country’s participation in the regional Catastrophic Risk Insurance Facility.

Strengthen the 
health system to 
improve 
coverage, 
quality and 
financing 
mechanisms  

Issues and Obstacles 

Advances have recently been 
made in reforming PHC benefits 
and expanding PHC coverage, but 
health management systems need 
to be further strengthened to 
improve quality of care and scale-
up programs, particularly outside 
Podgorica. 

Recent reforms to the HIF and 
pharmaceutical management have 
improved financial performance 
of the health system, but there is 
scope for further reform and 
regulation of drug purchases to 
curb costs and overall 
sustainability. 

Registering property and business 
licensing remain key impediments 
to business growth, largely due to 
weak cadastre services, poor 
municipal spatial planning, and 
complicated procedures.  

Creating an 
enhanced 
climate for 
business 
investment

Reduce 
environmental 
risks associated 
with industrial 
pollution 

Lake Skadar, a critical watershed 
and tourism site near the Adriatic 
coast, faces increased risks from 
pollution, overfishing, and 
development pressures that 
threaten its sustainability. 

Instances of poorly managed 
growth in Montenegro have led to 
polluted industrial disposal sites 
with hazardous waste that poses 
risks to human health and the 
environment.  

Strengthen the environmental management of Lake 
Skadar in cooperation with Albanian authorities, as 
indicated by: joint action on shared environmental 
challenges concerning fisheries management, 
wastewater, tourism, and industrial pollution.  

Reduce the environmental and public health risks of 
polluted industrial disposal sites, as indicated by  
- Environmental remediation completed of five 
industrial disposal sites (KAP in Podgorica; 
lignite thermal power plant in Pljevlja; lead-zinc 
tailings pond in Pljevlja; steel mills in Niksic; 
and the Bijela shipyard) 

Insuring against 
costs of natural 
disasters  

Increase the 
efficiency of 
energy use in 
the public

The Government and 
Montenegrin households have 
inadequate access to diversified, 
low-cost insurance covering the 
impacts of natural and climate-
related disasters. 
Montenegro’s energy 
consumption greatly exceeds EU 
averages, but the awareness and 
implementation of policies 
promoting energy efficiency in 
the public sector is limited. 

Improve access of the Government and households 
to low-cost catastrophe insurance products as 
indicated by:  
- 
Increase in share of households covered against 
climate-related and geo-perils from participation 
in CRIF (baseline: 0% in 2010; 10% by 2014)

Date of CPS Progress Report: March 20, 2009 

1. 
This Country Partnership Strategy Completion Report (CPSCR) takes stock of the 
effectiveness and impact of the World Bank’s assistance to Montenegro during FY07-10. The 
CPSCR assesses the extent to which the Bank has helped in the achievement of country goals and the 
appropriateness of the approaches adopted by the Bank. It also identifies lessons for future Bank 
partnership and programs in Montenegro. To undertake this review, the assessment team: 
 Reviewed progress on Montenegro’s principal long-term and medium-term goals 

 Examined the alignment between Montenegro’s development goals and the CPS, including the 
appropriateness of the CPS design 

 Assessed the extent of CPS achievements against the CPS pillars and Bank-influenced country 
outcomes 

 Analyzed Bank and borrower performance over the CPS period related to portfolio quality, 
preparation, and supervision (including the effectiveness of responses to problems) 

 Reviewed the impact of country aid dialogue and donor coordination 

 Derived lessons for future Bank assistance to the country 

2. Numerous sources were consulted to assess achievements and portfolio effectiveness. An in-
country visit was undertaken to meet with ministry and project officials, consult with donors and other 
stakeholders and, as feasible, obtain feedback from beneficiaries with regard to the effectiveness of Bank 
support to Montenegro. Within the Bank, interviews with the Country Manager and Country Office Staff 
as well as the Country Sector Coordinators provided important insights into the effectiveness of CPS 
activities, including the broad policy dialogue and donor coordination on a national and sectoral basis. 
Finally, on a project level, the team reviewed implementation status reports (ISRs) and supervisory and 
monitoring documentation, and interviewed task team leaders (TTLs) to review achievements and trends 
in project quality and performance.  

A. Progress on Country Development Outcomes 

3. 
Following independence in mid-2006, Montenegro developed its National Program of 
Integration (NPI) which established three medium-term development goals for its small, open 
economy—(i) accelerating sustainable, private sector-led economic growth, (ii) strengthening 
institutions and the rule of law, and (iii) improving the population’s living standards—within an 
overarching long-term vision of integration with the European Union. The Bank’s CPS, which was 
prepared shortly after independence, fully mirrored these country goals and sought to selectively support 
the Government’s efforts in mutually-agreed areas. The following paragraphs provide a general 
assessment of Montenegro’s progress with respect to each of the above national goals. Sections B and C 
of this report subsequently focus on the specific outcomes associated with Bank support for Montenegro 
and determines the extent to which these were met over the CPS period as well as the role that the Bank 
played in helping to achieve them.

Progress on EU Integration 

4. Montenegro has made significant progress toward achieving its overarching country 
objective: integration with the European Union (EU). The Government signed and ratified a 
Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) with the Council of the EU in late 2007, and the interim 
agreements on trade, visa facilitation and readmission became effective in January 2008. In mid-2008, 
Montenegro approved its ambitious NPI, which established sector objectives and benchmarks for 
compliance with EU standards, and in December 2008 submitted an official application for EU 
membership. Following completion by Montenegro of an extensive questionnaire related to compliance 
with EU standards, Montenegro’s SAA was ratified by all EU member states in late March 2010, thus 
allowing the Agreement to formally enter into force. The European Commission is currently preparing its 
opinion, to be published in early November 2010, on whether Montenegro is ready for the opening of 
accession talks with the EU.  

Economic Performance 

5. Montenegro’s pro-business policies and clear European perspective helped to achieve strong 
growth from independence in mid-2006 through late 2008, but its small, open economy was hard hit 
by the global crisis, leading to a sharp deterioration in growth as well as macroeconomic and 
financial sector indicators. GDP growth between 2006 and 2008 averaged 9%, propelled by strong 
domestic and external demand, rapid credit expansion, and substantial foreign direct investment (FDI), 
particularly in the real estate, construction, and tourism sectors. Credit to the private sector (y-o-y) grew 
from 33% of GDP in 2005 to 83% by June 2008, and net FDI averaged 19% of GDP over 2007 and 2008. 
However, rapidly increasing imports and falling exports drove the current account deficit (CAD) from 
8.5% of GDP in 2005 to 51.8% in 2008. Montenegro’s economy was overheated until mid-2008 and 
would likely have returned to lower growth rates over time, but the onset of the global crisis meant a very 
sharp, painful reduction in growth, in turn caused by contagion and concerns about the banking system 
which led to persistent withdrawals and a credit crunch, stagnation in tourism (including a decline in 
critically-important overnight visitors) and reduced external demand. Combined with drops in investment 
and eroded confidence, these factors led to a recession in 2009 and a contraction of GDP of close to 6%.  

6. Montenegro’s fiscal trends were closely linked to its growth performance. The Government 
achieved fiscal surpluses in 2006 and 2007, on the back of increased tax revenues, particularly value-
added taxes on imports. These surpluses drove an expansionary fiscal policy, which boosted consolidated 
expenditures and net lending to 48.8% in 2008. Additional outlays covered both capital and recurrent 
expenditures, including a notable expansion of spending on the wage bill, which reached 10% of GDP in 
2008. Reflecting the pro-cyclical nature of the tax regime, Montenegro’s fiscal position deteriorated after 
the crisis. General government revenues as a percent of GDP dropped 5.5 points to 42.9% between 2008 
and 2009. This decline was driven in part by the large arrears of the state electricity company (EPCG), 
KAP, and other large companies, which together accounted for tax arrears of almost 3% of GDP by 
October 2009. Owing to the widening deficit, gross public debt grew from 29% of GDP in 2008 to an 
estimated 38.8% in 2009. External debt rose from 79.4% of GDP in 2007 to an expected 98.2% in 2009.  

7. 
The crisis exacerbated existing vulnerabilities in Montenegro’s banking and financial sectors 
and prompted Government to undertake significant reforms to bolster the stability of the system. 
Growth (y-o-y) in domestic banking assets reached 172% in 2007 before plummeting sharply by 
December 2009. Increases in credit (y-o-y) of 139% in 2006, 176% in 2007, and 25% in 2008 was 
underpinned by substantial foreign borrowings but was also associated with declining asset quality and an 
increasing share of non-performing loans (NPLs). The massive, broad-based and persistent withdrawals 
from Montenegrin banks which occurred in the wake of the global financial crisis drained liquidity and, 
coupled with the banks’ own efforts to clean up their loan portfolios by tightening credit risk, led to a 

39 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Montenegro FY07-10 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 

severe credit crunch. In this context, Montenegro embarked on a major reform of its financial system and 
regulatory framework to mitigate challenges linked to the economic crisis and increase conformity with 
EU standards. Working with the WB and the IMF, Montenegro upgraded instruments to improve 
supervision of banks, including preparing amendments to the Law on Banks to enhance enforcement 
powers of the Central Bank of Montenegro (CBCG), improve corporate governance, and strengthen 
procedures for resolving troubled institutions. In large measure, the reforms undertaken followed the 
recommendations of the joint Bank-Fund FSAP which had been undertaken in 2006. 

8. 
To respond to the crisis and contain the widening fiscal deficit, the Government also 
undertook politically-difficult expenditure cuts to consolidate government and expenditure growth, 
including by privatizing selected state assets and concessions. The Government implemented a first 
round of expenditure cuts in early 2009 and a budget revision in July 2009 to account for lower growth 
under the crisis (assuming zero real GDP growth and 3% annual inflation). The revision included cuts in 
capital spending and moderation of the wage bill, and led to a moderated central government deficit of 
around 3% in 2009 – an outcome that was a vast improvement over the 8% deficit that had been projected 
for a non-revised budget and underscored Government’s commitment to a prudent fiscal stance. In 
addition, the Government privatized state owned enterprises and explored options for public private 
partnerships (PPPs) to lessen strain on public revenues. EPCG was unbundled in 2009 into a transmission 
company and entity overseeing generation and distribution with the support of Italian investors. Further, 
the legal framework was updated to facilitate concessions in infrastructure, particularly transport. Besides 
improving fiscal conditions, private investment in infrastructure is expected to reduce the CAD 
significantly over the medium-term. In light of these reforms and continued good outlook for tourism, 
Montenegro is expected to moderate its economic contraction to only 1.8% in 2009 and achieve growth of 
5.5% of GDP in 2011. 

Strengthening Institutions and the Rule of Law 

9. 
Both prior to and after the onset of the global crisis, Montenegro continued its efforts to 
strengthen public institutions and upgrade standards and legal frameworks to comply with EU 
requirements, focusing especially on the business climate. Montenegro’s overall ranking in the World 
Bank’s Doing Business Reports improved from 81 out of 178 countries in 2008 to 71 out of 183 countries 
in 2010.5 Rankings improved in trading across borders, employing workers, getting credit, and starting a 
business (see Chart 2). Rankings were largely static in enforcing contracts and closing a business. 
However, rankings deteriorated in paying taxes, registering property, and dealing with licensing. 
Surprisingly, the paying taxes ranking worsened despite a decrease in the tax rate for small and medium 
enterprises, which forms a component of this indicator. The registering property ranking fell due to an 
increase in property transaction costs, though there was no change to the number of procedures and days 
to complete a transaction. Doing Business’s dealing with licensing ranking is based on the days, costs, 
and procedures for building a proxy warehouse. In Montenegro, these costs and procedures decreased, but 
the days to receive a construction permit increased from 197 to 230 days. Despite these setbacks, the 
Government is supporting measures to improve property systems and business permitting, including by 
adopting a new spatial planning law in 2008 and instituting reforms to cadastral and other property 
services, but strong gains in the these areas are not expected until a few years after implementation. 

5 Data sets for Doing Business reports originate from June of the previous year (e.g., data for Doing Business 2010 
cover June 2009). The methodologies for calculating certain indicators were subject to modest revisions over 2008-
2010 as documented at http://www.doingbusiness.org/MethodologySurveys/

Montenegro FY07-10 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 

Improving living standards  

10. Available data suggest that unemployment and poverty fell throughout the CPS period, 
though the recession triggered by the global crisis now risks reversing trends unless growth picks 
up rapidly. Montenegro’s unemployment rate dropped significantly from 22.3% in 2004 to a projected 
10.7% in 2008. In 2009, headline unemployment and employment data continued to suggest a strong 
labor market. However, this data obscured underemployment, particularly in KAP, rising part-time 
employment, and substitution of domestic for foreign labor. In effective terms, employment is projected 
by the IMF to have dropped 14%, and further decreases are possible given the possible restructuring of 
KAP. According to an analysis of 2007 Household Budget Survey Data, the national poverty rate fell 
from 11.2% in 2005 to 8% in 2007, with rural poverty more than double the rate in urban areas. Though 
the overall pattern is favorable, projected contractions in GDP in 2009 and 2010 will likely reverse this 
trend, particularly as 18.2% of Montenegrins are “at risk” of poverty with average consumption less than 
25 percent above the poverty line. Indeed, poverty simulations assuming three-year annual average 
growth rates of between -1% to -2%, which encompass the forecasted -1.3% average contraction between 
2009 to 2011, suggest a modest increase in the national poverty rate to between 8.9% and 9.5%.  

B. Government’s Strategic Goals and CPS Design 

11. As mentioned above, The FY07-10 CPS was designed to support Montenegro’s EU aspiration 
as well as its specific medium-term development goals. The proposed portfolio reflected the priorities 
of Montenegro’s SAA and the Government’s 2007 to 2011 Economic Reform Program. At Government’s 
request, the CPS integrated EU accession requirements into planned activities wherever possible, 
including supporting the development of institutions and mechanisms that would help Montenegro tap 
into the EU’s Instrument for Pre-Accession financing (e.g., in rural development). Within the framework 
of EU integration, the World Bank adopted the Government’s three major policy priorities as CPS pillars:  
(i) 
Enhance sustainable economic growth, 
through 
increasing economic freedoms and 
strengthening the role of the private sector;  
Build institutions and the rule of law; and 
Improve the standard of living of citizens, through efficient education, health and social 
protection systems. 

(ii) 
(iii)

Montenegro FY07-10 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 

12. Selective lending assistance and knowledge services were designed to be coordinated and 
mutually reinforcing, while capitalizing on the World Bank Group’s comparative advantages. 
Investments and analytical work were selected to exploit synergies between IBRD and the International 
Finance Corporation (IFC), though IFC’s activities would undoubtedly be opportunistic, depending on 
actual demand from the private sector. Achieving effective donor coordination was also a key aim of the 
CPS. Proposed interventions took account of activities of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and 
diverse multilateral organizations, including the EC, European Investment Bank (EIB), European Bank 
for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). 
In addition, the CPS coordinated its activities with several bilateral donors, such as the development arms 
of Germany, Japan, Canada, Japan, Finland, and the United States. 

13. The CPS was aligned to Montenegro’s political cycle to ensure country ownership and 
effective interventions, and included base and high case scenarios linked to policy performance. The 
CPS supported policy priorities of the Government expected to be in office until 2010. A new CPS in 
early FY11 was projected based on discussions with newly elected officials following Parliamentary 
elections in late 2010. Base case assistance was to include US$19 million from IDA (FY07) and US$50 
million from IBRD (FY08-10) channeled through seven projects, complemented by select technical 
assistance (TA), economic and social work (ESW), and GEF support. The high case was to include an 
additional US$20 million from IBRD in FY10. IDA financing was limited to FY07, reflecting residual 
uncommitted IDA funds from the FY05-FY07 CAS for Serbia and Montenegro, followed by a transition 
to IBRD financing given Montenegro’s middle-income status. Under the base case, the CPS was expected 
to reduce the number of annual investment projects from two to one given concerns about implementation 
and absorptive capacity. 

Design Changes at CPS Mid-Term 

14. The CPS Progress Report (CPSPR) in March 2009 affirmed good progress on the CPS’s base 
and high case triggers, but reaffirmed the base case given uncertainties about Montenegro’s 
creditworthiness and the economic climate. As Annex 1 illustrates, most base and high case indicators 
were satisfied at the end of the CPS, though performance on fiscal and economic indicators involving 
debt and balance of payments remained mixed. 

15. The CPSPR introduced a number of programmatic changes. Though most lending and AAA 
programs were on track, the proposed FY10 Improved Social Services Project was dropped as the 
Government expressed support for other priorities, such as additional financing for the FY04 Montenegro 
Health information Project (MSHIP). In addition, the CPSPR expanded options for a possible high case 
project beyond the proposed FY10 Transport Project. Contingent on fiscal and economic performance, 
the CPSPR noted possibilities for an investment project in higher education or environmental mediation, 
or development policy lending (DPL) if economic conditions deteriorated significantly.  

16. Finally, the CPSPR introduced a revised results matrix to reflect emerging best practice in 
Bank monitoring and evaluation (M&E). The original CPS results matrix had an excessive number of 
indicators and milestones relative to the portfolio’s size. In addition, certain indicators were weakly 
constructed, and some results chains overestimated the influence of Bank interventions (e.g., attributing 
Montenegro’s satisfactory macroeconomic performance to limited ESW activities). The revised matrix, 
which serves as the benchmark for this Completion Report, permitted a more realistic portrayal and 
assessment of WB activities and achievements over FY07-10.

C. CAS Results Assessment 

17. This section takes stock of the contribution of the World Bank Group to the achievement of results 
under the three pillars of the Montenegro CPS. The results matrix in Annex 2 summarizes the results 
achieved and lessons learned. The presentation follows the pillars of the CPS noted above, and discusses 
progress on Bank-influenced outcomes. 

Pillar I. Enhance Sustainable Economic Growth 

Country Priority: Sustain Macroeconomic Stability and Maintain Sustainable Economic Growth 

18. CPS goals under this Priority included strengthening government capacity to manage 
macroeconomic and fiscal challenges, and improving public financial management and fiduciary 
controls. Though these outcomes were largely achieved, measuring the degree to which they can be 
attributed to the Bank is difficult. The Government’s fiscal management has clearly strengthened 
considerably, particularly in the wake of the 2009 recession. Quick government action contained the 2009 
deficit from a projected 8% to a much more manageable 3.2% of GDP, including making politically-
difficult cuts in wages and pushing forward with privatization in key areas. Notable progress was also 
made in strengthening financial controls, budget planning, and fiduciary systems to improve the 
effectiveness and transparency of public financial management (PFM). The Government collaborated 
with many donors to achieve these objectives, including the WB and the IMF, and pursued 
comprehensive fiduciary reform, which is laying the foundation for e-procurement.  

19. Technical assistance, advisory services, and ESW provided by the Bank helped to strengthen 
government capacity in these areas. A comprehensive Public Expenditure and Institutional Review 
(PEIR) was completed in 2008 and its recommendations on fiscal strategies were welcome by authorities. 
In 2009, the Bank completed a Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment (PEFA) that 
benchmarked financial management practices and led to strategies to improve financial controls, budget 
planning, and public procurement in line with EU standards. Testifying to the quality of these studies, the 
Government requested follow-up TA on the PEIR and the PEFA for FY10 and FY11 to respond to post-
crisis needs and propose additional measures to facilitate compliance with EU requirements. These 
reports and TA have guided dialogue on a proposed program of development policy lending under the 
next CPS. Moreover, it is worth noting that Government requested the Bank to undertake an additional 
follow-up Public Expenditure Review (PER)—currently nearing completion—focused on ways to better 
manage social spending, suggesting that the analysis has been useful for policy design and fiscal 
management. 

20. The CPS also aimed to strengthen the institutional framework for managing transport and 
infrastructure services, particularly through public private partnerships (PPPs), and to improve 
capacity in road safety management. Montenegro faced critical needs to upgrade and build roads and 
other transport infrastructure to improve its competitiveness, but the Government’s fiscal space was 
limited, and the institutional framework for harnessing PPPs was inadequate along with the understanding 
of how to tailor PPPs to transport projects. To begin addressing these issues, authorities developed and 
approved a new, comprehensive framework law for Concessions that supported outsourcing public 
infrastructure services without increasing pressure on public finances. In addition, high rates of accidents 
and weak overall safety on public roadways prompted authorities to prioritize upgrading road safety 
standards and the capacity of relevant agencies. 

21. Good progress on these outcomes was achieved with the support of Bank-managed trust 
funds and IFC advisory services. Bank TA and analyses funded by the Public-Private Infrastructure 
Advisory Facility (PPIAF) provided inputs to develop the draft Concessions Law, and supported 

43 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Montenegro FY07-10 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 

feasibility studies on key transport corridors that could be developed through PPPs. Under the PEP-SE 
Infrastructure program, IFC helped authorities to structure a PPP transaction to finance, construct, and 
operate 170 km of motorway between Bar and Boljare, which is designed to connect Montenegro’s 
coastal areas with its northern region and Serbia (the preferred bidder for this project is currently seeking 
financing). In addition, PPIAF funded a study on national capacity in managing road safety as well as two 
pilot demonstration projects. Moreover, all relevant milestones in the CPS result framework were 
achieved through these interventions. 

22. The final outcome under this priority was to improve coordination and capacity in poverty 
analysis and measurement. At the outset of the CPS, government capacity in poverty measurement and 
social assistance evaluation was limited, and associated services were fragmented across the Statistical 
Office of Montenegro (MONSTAT), the Ministry of Labor, and the Ministry of Finance. The 
Government sought to improve institutional coordination to heighten programmatic efficiency while 
improving the methodology for poverty measurement and the accuracy of projections. With Bank support, 
solid gains were made in strengthening coordination and capacity in poverty analysis. The FY07 
Programmatic Poverty Assessment and follow-up TA helped MONSTAT to enhance its use of Household 
Budget Survey (HBS) data to develop poverty profiles for 2005 and 2006, and to strengthen its 
coordination with other ministries on poverty statistics. The Bank’s collaboration led to development of a 
joint discussion note on HBS data, and—testifying to the Bank’s success in transferring knowledge—
MONSTAT developed its own note on employing HBS data in 2009 with the World Bank serving as 
solely a peer reviewer. In addition, the Bank supported a regional study on social safety nets that 
benchmarked Montenegro’s performance in targeting and covering the poor through social assistance 
programs, particularly “last-resort” social assistance, while proposing reforms to enhance coverage, 
strengthen eligibility requirements, reduce work disincentives, and improve benefit administration. 

Country Priority: Strengthen Environmental Management and Tourism Planning 

23. The CPS strove to influence three outcomes under this priority: (i) strengthen water and solid 
waste services in coastal municipalities facing development pressures from tourism; (ii) establish a 
protected area in the Bojana Delta; and (iii) strengthen environmental management of Lake Skadar—
a key watershed. These objectives reflected concerns about the rapid recent growth in coastal areas 
including the Bojana Delta, and concomitant pressures on natural resources and the region’s increasingly 
inadequate water and sanitation infrastructure. Authorities recognized the need to carefully manage the 
growth and the natural endowment of the coastal region given its importance as major tourist destination 
and source of revenue. Simultaneously, authorities aimed to improve the management of Lake Skadar, the 
largest lake in the Balkans situated between Albania and Montenegro seven kilometers from the Adriatic 
Sea, as it was facing threats to its pristine beauty and value as a tourist site from overfishing, pollution, 
and poorly managed development. 

24. Two bank operations supported the outcomes related to water and sanitation and protection 
of the Bojana Delta: the FY07 Montenegro Sustainable Tourism Development Project (MSTDP), 
and the F04 Montenegro Environmentally Sensitive Tourist Areas Project (MESTAP). MSTDP 
supported government efforts to construct a Regional Water Supply (RWS) pipeline network to channel 
water from Lake Skadar to coastal cities, particularly the pipeline segment between Lake Skadar and Bar. 
As MSTDP was designed to promote “integrated coastal management,” the project linked support for 
water infrastructure to the establishment of a protected area on the Bojana Delta. In turn, MESTAP was 
designed to help major coastal cities, including Bar, Ulcinj, Kotor, Tivat, and Budva, address critical and 
growing problems in the solid waste sector, including unsanitary waste disposal, insufficient landfill 
capacity, limited coverage of waste services, and inadequate institutional management. 

44 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Montenegro FY07-10 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 

25. With support from the MSTDP, the Government successfully completed the RWS network 
and increased 24-hour water connections in coastal areas. However, MSTDP’s overall contributions 
were less than expected as the project was cancelled in FY09 owing to a lack of progress on 
establishing a protected area on the Bojana Delta. Buttressed by strong local support, MSTDP 
investments in regional water supply infrastructure made good gains from the project’s outset. However, 
unexpected disagreements among stakeholders on what constituted adequate protection of the Delta 
stalled progress on this project component, thereby undermining MSTDP’s aims to promote sustainable 
tourism and integrated coastal management. MSTDP supported a background study on the protection of 
the Delta in 2008, but stakeholder disagreements impeded its approval, even as its water infrastructure 
components progressed satisfactorily and the Bank team considered additional financing to support a 
second segment of the RWS to Ulcinj and Velika Plaza. The Bank entered dialogue with stakeholders to 
attempt to resolve disagreements, but a consensus was not reached, and in late 2009 the Ministry of 
Spatial Planning and Environmental Protection informed the Bank that the Government did not intend to 
establish a protected area. Given the fundamental importance of this component to the project, and the 
fact that the project had fully disbursed on the RWS component, the Bank chose to cancel the project in 
January 2010. MSTDP’s investment in water infrastructure, which accounted for only 20% of the total 
cost of the RWS, were on track when the project closed, having supported construction of 60% of the 
RWS segment to Bar. However, some delays had occurred due to seasonal weather and technical design 
issues related to the underwater segment in Lake Skadar. Since the project closed in early 2010, the 
Government tapped other financing sources to complete the RWS, but data on improved household water 
connections, a key indicator of the CPS, are not yet available.  

26. Government efforts to strengthen solid waste services in coastal areas were mixed. Though 
certain CPS milestones were achieved under MESTAP, progress was uneven and planned landfill 
investments were impeded by stakeholder disagreements and a funding shortfall linked to the 
economic crisis. Given concerns about pollution and weak solid waste services along the coast, the 
Government prioritized closing unsanitary disposal sites, increasing landfill capacity, and strengthening 
solid waste institutions and services. Legislation was also approved in 2008 requiring coastal cities to 
properly dispose of waste in sanitary landfills or face penalties. To support these goals, MESTAP funded 
the closure of two unsanitary disposal sites; financed new trucks, containers and waste equipment for 
Kotor, Tivat, and Budva; and successfully rehabilitated a waste disposal site into a regional sanitary 
landfill serving the these cities, which was operated by a regional waste management company 
established through the project. However, this landfill, which originally operated under a temporary 
license issued by the Municipality of Kotor, closed in 2008 after the Kotor declined to renew its license 
and use as a long-term landfill, apparently due to ‘not in my backyard (NIMBY)’ concerns about its 
location. Plans are now in place to construct as second regional landfill for these cities at another location 
under a possible project financed by the EIB. The construction of a second regional landfill under 
MESTAP serving Bar and Ulcinj and the creation of a second landfill company were also delayed due to 
disagreements among stakeholders on the landfill’s location, and later due to a shortfall in government co-
financing linked to a fiscal deterioration under the crisis. Given these delays, MESTAP’s IP rating 
dropped to unsatisfactory between June 2007 and March 2008 pending agreement on a suitable site, 
though its rating was upgraded to moderately unsatisfactory after all parties agreed on a site at Mozura. 
Further improvements in MESTAP’s rating are contingent on procuring adequate funds to cover the 
approximately €4.5 million financing gap for the landfill’s construction. Ongoing consultations with the 
Government and EIB, a key donor in the sector, have led to the development of an additional financing 
proposal to cover this gap. This proposal, which is expected to be submitted to the Executive Board in fall 
2010, would restructure the project and direct funding solely on constructing the new Mozura landfill, 
while shifting to EIB the financing of outstanding activities relating to closure of two additional waste 
disposal sites originally under MESTAP. 

45

27. Despite MESTAP’s complications, significant progress was achieved on the primary CPS 
outcome of strengthening solid waste services in coastal areas, though only modest progress can be 
attributed to the Bank. Over the project period, significant advances were achieved in increasing 
recycling and the frequency of waste collection. More specifically, the percent of solid waste in targeted 
coastal cities collected and disposed of in proper facilities increased from 0% in 2004 to 65% in 2010. 
Some of this increase can be attributed to MESTAP’s financing trucks and equipment and the creation of 
a working regional model for waste collection, including the establishment of a functioning waste 
management company serving Kotor, Budva, and Tivat. However, most gains in proper collection and 
disposal are due to coastal cities inefficiently transporting their waste to a sanitary landfill in Podgorica to 
comply with the waste management legislation, and not, as intended, increased access to viable long-term 
regional landfills. This variance is particularly pronounced in Bar and Ulcinj, where MESTAP did not 
finance waste disposal equipment and where the planned regional waste management company is not yet 
in operation pending completion of the second regional landfill. 

28. No significant progress was expected in the CPS on strengthening the environmental 
management of Lake Skadar, as the associated FY08 GEF program is just getting underway. 
However, work has begun on drafting a Lake Management Plan, the completion of which was a CPS 
milestone. In addition, a Lake Commission was established, contracting is underway to support a 
hydrological study, and working groups on fisheries, water management, and other subjects were 
established and are meeting regularly. The project has also hired an advisor on environmental issues and 
tendering is underway for studies on solid waste categorization for KAP, a major polluter in the area. This 
project is noteworthy for its effective involvement of Albania under a joint-Lake management plan, and is 
expected to make strong gains in the next CPS period.  

29. 
IFC’s engagement in tourism and environmental management was modest given the impact 
of the global crisis, which reduced the appetite of private investors for new investments. 
Nonetheless, IFC participated in a joint mini-diagnostic of the investment climate focusing on tourism. In 
addition, IFC’s Balkan Hotel Market Access Program remains active and is contributing to opening 
Montenegro’s lucrative travelers’ market. Through the PEP-SE Infrastructure program, IFC is currently 
engaged with the municipalities of Berane, Rozaje, Plav and Andrijevica, which comprise about 80,000 
inhabitants and generate about 35,000 tons of solid waste annually, to attract a private partner to invest 
€14 million in developing and operating a new regional landfill. The project is expected to significantly 
improve waste management services and improve the environment in project areas in later years. 

30. The mixed progress in the MSTDP and MESTAP operations illuminate important lessons: 

 

Though the strategic goal of complex projects—such as the aim of MSTDP to promote 
“sustainable tourism development”—may reasonably entail linking relatively straightforward 
investments to politically sensitive or difficult outcomes, the Bank is advised to carefully 
assess the realism of such linkages and consider alternative designs to confirm government 
commitment. The underlying philosophy of MSTDP to facilitate integrated coastal management 
and sustainable development in coastal areas by linking water infrastructure investments to 
establishing a protected area on the Bojana Delta was reasonable given increasing shares of 
uncontrolled construction and the clear need to “incentivize” improved growth management. 
However, the Central Government’s expressed commitment to establishing a protected area during 
project preparation proved untenable during execution owing to unexpected disagreements among 
local municipalities and stakeholders. In future similarly designed operations, the Bank should 
undertake a more comprehensive assessment of stakeholder interests in achieving potentially 
controversial outcomes, and consider mandating: 1) more tangible evidence of government 
commitment toward the politically more sensitive component before project approval; and/or 2) 
demonstration of substantial progress on the more controversial component before any 

46 

 
 
 
 
 
Montenegro FY07-10 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 

disbursements on the less controversial component. In some cases, it may also be wise to separate 
the more straightforward and politically charged investments into two separate projects, while 
conceding that this runs the risk of altering the nature of the program. 

 More broadly, it is recommended that the Bank perform greater due diligence when 
operations involve multiple stakeholders and levels of government. Disagreements and conflicts 
among central government, municipalities, and stakeholders over project activities impaired 
achievement of outcomes in solid waste management and natural resource protection under 
MESTAP and MSTDP. The execution of both of these projects might have been improved had the 
Bank undertaken a more comprehensive evaluation of the views of the municipalities and 
stakeholders involved in project outcomes, particularly to identify perspectives that are different 
from those of the central government. By more clearly identifying the interests and balance of 
power among the stakeholders, such an assessment might also have led to more effective project 
leadership, possibly by identifying “champion” agencies that could have more strongly supported 
the projects’ goals. 

Country Priority: Improve the efficiency and sustainability of the energy sector 

31. CPS outcomes under this Priority included strengthening communication linkages with SEE 
utilities to better manage the regional energy trade, and improving the quality of energy supplies in 
two regions (Mojkovac and Andrijevica). The first outcome was linked to government efforts to 
integrate Montenegro into the SEE and EU electricity markets, which is expected to enhance the 
country’s long-term energy security given Montenegro’s high share of electricity imports. As part of this 
overall plan, authorities also supported investments in EPCG, Montenegro’s energy utility, to improve its 
operational efficiency, including unbundling its assets to reduce its fiscal burden on the state. Increasing 
private sector participation in power generation was also identified as mechanism to ensure fiscally 
sustainable solutions to growing power needs. In the Mojkovac and Andrijevica regions, authorities 
aimed to reduce the frequency of power outages through investments in additional transmission 
infrastructure. 

32. Significant progress was made on these outcomes, though data is not yet available on reduced 
power outages in these two regions. Under the FY08 Montenegro Energy Community of Southeast 
Europe (ECSEE) Adjustment Program Loan (APL) 3, optical ground wire communication lines enabling 
better management of the cross-border power trade were completed with Bosnia & Herzegovina, and 
contracts are underway for a line with Serbia. Completion of these lines was the sole CPS milestone 
linked to the improving communication linkages with the SEE utilities. As envisaged under the CPS, 
additional transmission line circuits were completed for the Mojkovac and Andrijevica substations, which 
are expected to reduce regional blackouts. However, data on power interruptions will not be available 
until late 2010. While not addressed in the CPS results framework, the ECSEE APL3 also improved the 
operational reliability of the Perucica Hydropower Plant by installing new trash rack designed to reduce 
power failures, which is expected to decrease energy production losses by 5% by 2011 (data on losses not 
yet available). In line with the government plan, authorities proceeded in March 2009 to unbundle EPCG 
into a new transmission company and an entity overseeing power generation and distribution. This 
unbundling led to a restructuring of the APL’s activities in late 2009, which proceeded well, though 
dialogue with the PIU was required to ensure tracking of project components linked to the new 
transmission company. Overall, progress on this project has been in line with expectations. 

33. An additional CPS outcome to improve energy efficiency in the public sector was not achieved, 
mainly due to delays in the associated Bank project, though planned energy-saving retrofits of 
targeted public buildings are being installed. Recognizing increasing demand for energy and concerns 

47 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Montenegro FY07-10 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 

about the impacts of energy generation on climate change, the Government prioritized promoting energy 
efficiency in the public sector by retrofitting public buildings with energy-saving materials and 
technologies. In support of this priority, the FY09 Montenegro Energy Efficiency Project (MEEP) aims to 
improve energy efficiency in select public schools and hospitals through energy-saving retrofits, with a 
view to providing a model for energy efficiency that can be replicated nationally. Under MEEP, detailed 
energy audits have been completed for several facilities, and retrofits of two schools are underway, which 
include improvements to windows, insulation, roofs, and other aspects of building envelopes. MEEP also 
entered a contract to retrofit a hospital, and by end-2010, it is expected to have completed retrofits of this 
facility and three schools. However, MEEP, like other projects in the portfolio, was delayed by the 
dissolution of the Technical Services Unit (TSU)—an agency set up in the Ministry of Finance (MOF) in 
2005 to handle project fiduciary responsibilities given limited country capacity. Though the TSU initially 
provided efficient services to MEEP and other projects, a salary dispute in 2009 led to the resignation of 
staff for several months, leaving several projects without adequate support (see paragraph 61). In MEEP’s 
case, the subsequent need to hire a procurement specialist and enhance capacity within the PIU slowed 
activities and required greater project supervision. MEEP was also delayed by the Government’s failure 
to include the project in its FY09 budget, and the Bank’s underestimation of the time to complete energy 
audits. On the positive side, the Project Coordinator for MEEP has been a strong leader, which has helped 
to mitigate problems and put the project back on track. 

34. 
IFC complemented Bank support by promoting private sector participation in energy 
operations and power generation. IFC engaged in ongoing dialogue with authorities on assessing 
further options for privatizing the EPCG, including reviewing potential investors. Through the PEP-SE 
Infrastructure program, IFC is advising the Government on structuring a PPP transaction to finance 
construction and operation of a cascade of hydropower plants on the Moraca River. The associated 
investment, which could exceed €500 million for construction of four dams with an annual generation 
capacity of 721 GWh, would respond to Montenegro’s growing energy needs while tapping into a 
renewable, low-carbon resource. IFC finalized the legal, financial and technical due diligence of this 
project and assisted the government in completing the prequalification process, which resulted in 
qualification of four renowned investors to submit project proposals. Following IFC’s recommendations, 
authorities made preliminary structuring decisions in May 2010, and IFC is now preparing tender and 
contractual documentation. Submission of proposals from qualified investors is planned for spring 2011.  

35. A few lessons can be derived from the Bank’s engagement in the energy sector. Although the 
APL3 has progressed well, there was some concern about resettlement issues concerning site locations for 
the transmission line circuits. In retrospect, it may have been better to cite arrangements for siting such 
towers in the project agreement. On the positive side, the decision under MEEP to enter into individual 
contracts for retrofitting each institution was likely a good design feature, as lumping retrofits into on 
contract risks slowing all project activities in the event of one serious procurement issue (as has 
apparently been the case in other countries). In addition, it will be critical over the next CPS period to 
ensure that the staff in the TSU is committed to their positions, and that any additional project involving 
audits be mindful to allocate sufficient time to their completion. 

Pillar II. Build institutions and the rule of law 

Country Priority: Improved regulatory environment for businesses, including land registration and 
improve property rights 

36. Broadly speaking, the CPS strove to improve Montenegro’s business climate by diagnosing 
key challenges and strengthening land administration systems, with a view to fulfilling the sole CPS 
outcome: streamlined land registration and business permitting procedures. Montenegro’s high pace of 
economic activity in 2007 and the resultant slowdown from the economic crisis focused attention on 

48 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Montenegro FY07-10 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 

barriers to doing business, particularly constraints in transacting property and fostering businesses 
growth. In response, the Government initiated steps to develop the real estate cadastre, strengthen spatial 
planning, and streamline permitting procedures. Authorities also prioritized enhancing access to finance 
among small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and upgrading business practices to international standards 
to ensure the country’s growth and competitiveness. 

37. The Bank’s Doing Business TA program funded by FIAS provided strong insight into key 
business hurdles, satisfying a milestone of Bank assistance. The FIAS-funded program shed light on 
regulatory and policy hurdles to doing business, and subsequent dialogue and TA led to the development 
of a government reform strategy and the establishment of a Council on Eliminating Business Barriers. 
Based on these diagnostics, the Government has undertaken reforms in 2009 and 2010 to improve 
business start-up, trade logistics, and paying taxes.  

38. Assistance under the ongoing FY09 Land Administration and Management Project (LAMP), 
which aims to improve property registration and permitting procedures, has made satisfactory 
progress on its key outputs and CPS milestones. As expected under the CPS, strategies were devised to 
develop an automated system for the real estate cadastre, and development and testing of such a system is 
underway. LAMP also supported the completion of urban spatial plans for two municipalities, and 
tendering is underway for urban plans focused on six northern municipalities. LAMP activities have 
significantly improved the efficiency of municipal cadastre offices in Podgorica, Budva, and Zabljak, as 
measured by a reduction in the percent of pending cases. In addition to these achievements, LAMP has 
supported the roll-out of an information system facilitating ministerial approval of local spatial plans, and 
implementation of an extensive training program for staff at the national and municipal level.  

39. However, LAMP has not realized reportable progress on its key project outcomes, partly due 
to the impacts of the crisis and project delays. Reforms supported by LAMP were designed to increase 
real estate transactions, and the project adopted an increase in the real estate transfer tax as an associated 
proxy indicator. Though good progress was made on systemic reforms, real estate taxes fell about 50% in 
2009 as property sales plummeted under the economic crisis. Further, Doing Business reports no change 
in the days (86) to register property between 2008 and 2010, and an increase in the days to issue 
construction permits. Even under optimal circumstances, LAMP might not have made much progress at 
this early stage on its key outcome indicators, and the Bank may have been overzealous in including 
reductions in the time to register property and issue construction permits in the CPS result matrix. 
However, it is noteworthy that the original approval date of the project slipped six months to December 
2009 owing to protracted negotiations on the extent of safeguards for its land management components, 
particularly given enhanced scrutiny of safeguards linked to an Inspection Panel case of an Albania 
project involving demolitions. The implementation of certain project activities was also slowed by the 
inexperience of implementing agencies in executing Bank-financed projects, as well as the dissolution of 
the TSU, which required the project to engage specialized fiduciary consultants. Despite these hurdles, it 
is expected that good progress on the outputs detailed in the preceding paragraph will translate into strong 
gains in the next CPS period.  

40. 
IFC provided complementary investment and advisory services to support competitiveness 
and business development through country-specific and regional programs. Between FY07 and 
FY10, IFC invested about US$30 million in two country projects: the development in Podgorica of a 
mixed-used shopping mall that introduced new retail standards, and an investment in a foreign bank to 
support programs promoting growth of SMEs. IFC invested US$190 million in regional projects 
supporting SMEs, commercial property development, and growth sectors. The largest Montenegrin 
portion of these regional investments was the micro-finance regional fund (EFSE), which now has €59.6 
million exposed in five Montenegrin lending partners that are providing finance to commercial 
enterprises. IFC provided successful advisory services, including the International Standards and 

49 

 
 
 
 
 
Montenegro FY07-10 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 

Technical Regulations Program, which has trained more than 30 local consultants and 130 companies on 
implementing international regulations to increase commercial sales, exports, and investments. Under the 
Sub-national Competitiveness Project, IFC supported streamlined and transparent business regulations in 
Bar, Bijelo Polje and Niksi, which enabled businesses in these areas to save over €3 million annually. In 
addition, IFC worked with the Ministry of Justice to open a second Mediation Center in Podgorica 
focusing on commercial disputes. Under this program, judges were trained and 110 cases with legal 
claims totaling €4.5 million were successfully resolved.  

Country Priority: Strengthen and deepen the financial sector 

41. Bank assistance over the CPS sought to address critical vulnerabilities in the financial sector, 
including structural weaknesses underlying unsustainable credit growth and weak banking 
regulation. Specific outcomes included reducing the economic risks of rapid credit growth by supporting 
implementation of recommendations identified in the Bank-IMF FY06 Financial Sector Adjustment 
Program (FSAP) report, and harmonizing financial sector legislation to EU standards. In addition, the 
Bank aimed to enhance government capacity to assess banking sector risks and propose remedial actions, 
and to update corporate and financial reporting requirements aligned with EU directives. 

42. Amid increasing pressure for reform during the economic crisis, the Government made 
substantial progress on implementing FSAP recommendations and harmonizing financial 
legislation with the EU. The immediate impact of the crisis was contained through the prompt passage in 
late 2008 of a temporary Law on Measures for Protection of the Banking System. At the same time, the 
Central Bank strengthened regulations on bank provisioning, capital requirements, and risk weighting to 
slow the unsustainable pace of credit growth. In the past year, the authorities, with support of extensive 
TA from WB and IMF, have worked on a comprehensive review of financial sector legislation to align it 
with EU best practices. This work culminated in the passage, in mid-2010, of amendments to the Law on 
Banks and the Law on Bank Bankruptcy and Liquidation, and approval of a new Law on the Deposit 
Protection Fund, the Central Bank Law, and the Financial Stability Council Law. 

43. With the support of the Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening (FIRST) Initiative, 
analytical activities, and TA under the proposed DPL series, Montenegro also made good progress 
on strengthening capacity to assess banking sector risks, as well as upgrading corporate and 
financial reporting standards. An FY09 Early Warning Toolkit grant funded by FIRST helped to 
develop and test new methodologies for on-site Bank examinations and stress-testing of credit risk 
models. The Bank subsequently advised the Central Bank on conducting in-depth on-site examinations 
and stress-testing systemic banks, which served as an analytical foundation for developing bank-specific 
supervisory action plans. Finally, the Bank was closely involved in assisting the Montenegrin authorities 
in designing the least-cost resolution strategies for problem banks. With respect to corporate and financial 
reporting, an FY07 Report on Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) analyzed Montenegro’s 
financial and auditing standards and identified needed reforms to legislation. Complementing this 
diagnostic work, an FY10 grant from FIRST has supported the development and adoption of a Country 
Strategy and Action Plan to enhance the quality of corporate sector financial reporting to comply with EU 
standards. In addition, TA supported amendments to Montenegro’s Law on Accounting and Auditing to 
ensure alignment with EU directives.  

44. Bank-country collaboration in the financial sector was strong, and all milestones in the CPS 
results framework were eventually achieved. The Bank achieved important synergies by supporting 
complementary studies and TA and working closely with the IMF and donors. The diagnostic work under 
the FSAP and the ROSC generated constructive dialogue and recommendations on financial sector 
challenges, particularly related to EU accession, and underpinned TA and the reform program of proposed 

50 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Montenegro FY07-10 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 

DPL. However, it is worth noting that, as in many other countries in Southeast Europe, the crisis was a 
factor in securing support for necessary reforms which could have been delayed absent such pressure. 

Pillar III. Improving the Standard of Living for Citizens 

Country Priority: Enhance Opportunities for Rural and Regional Development 

45. Bank interventions in this priority area were designed to upgrade rural development and 
agriculture practices in line with EU standards, improve institutional capacity to manage rural 
development assistance from the EU, and strengthen the capacity of extension services to introduce 
agro-environmental measures. As noted, agriculture is important for employment and poverty reduction 
in Montenegro, particularly as over half of the poorest fifth of the population lives in rural areas. 
However, the quality and productivity of agriculture has been undermined by limited capital, inadequate 
extension services, and underdeveloped standards in agriculture and food safety. In this context, 
Montenegro prioritized upgrading agriculture practices, particularly standards in food and environmental 
safety, to align practices to those of the EU and permit access to financial assistance under the Instrument 
for Pre-Accession for Rural Development (IPARD). Montenegro also sought to build capacity in agro-
environmental extension to mainstream sustainable resource practices while tapping into eco-tourism 
opportunities, particularly in its pristine northern regions. 

46. Assistance under the CPS was channeled through the FY09 Montenegro Institutional 
Development and Agriculture Strengthening (MIDAS) project. This project and an associated GEF 
program were designed to improve compliance with EU agricultural standards as well as capacity to 
implement assistance under the IPARD system and agro-environmental services. Both the IBRD and GEF 
operations became effective in July 2009 and have initiated activities that have made some progress 
toward the achievement of CPS milestones. With Bank support, Montenegro has completed its first 
Agricultural Census in 40 years, which will underpin further development of the national rural 
development program. Steps have been taken toward establishing an IPARD compatible payment agency, 
and accreditation and capacity building activities targeting food safety, veterinary, and phyto-sanitary 
agencies and laboratories are in progress. In addition, specialists are being hired to increase the capacity 
of extension and advisory services in agro-environmental issues. 

47. However, outcomes are less than expected under the CPS due to project delays. MIDAS was 
the first Bank project under the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Management (MAFWM), 
and MAFWM was slow to hire a project manager. The dissolution of the TSU delayed procurement 
supporting some activities, such as the noted Agricultural Census, which was postponed from fall 2009 to 
spring 2010. As a result, many expected milestones in the CPS results matrix have not yet been fully 
accomplished, such as development of a Code of Good Agriculture Practices, the full establishment of the 
IPARD compatible payment unit, and trainings on agro-environmental issues within Montenegro’s 
Extension Service. Procurement activities should accelerate now that new personnel occupy the TSU, but 
this project again highlights the importance of sufficient fiduciary support to ensure timely and effective 
project execution. 

Country Priority: Improve quality and efficiency of education services 

48. The World Bank provided assistance before and during the CPS period to improve the 
quality of teaching and learning, renovate schools to improve academic environments, and 
strengthen the management and efficiency of education expenditure. The Government prioritized 
these objectives as educational approaches were outdated and below EU standards, and academic 
infrastructure was inadequate, with some of Montenegro’s 600 plus schools in disrepair or operating in 
multiple shifts. These efforts were linked to the Government’s comprehensive education reform begun in 

51 

 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
Montenegro FY07-10 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 

1999, which aimed to apply updated curriculums in primary and secondary education. In parallel, the 
Government sought to address deficiencies in sector planning and budgeting, which had led to significant 
arrears in education budget of 10% in 2005. Specific CPS outcomes sought to improve education quality 
in the government’s “reform” schools and improve the use of budgetary resources in the education 
sector. 

49. The FY05 Montenegro Education Reform Project (MERP), which closed in December 2009, 
provided successful and widely praised support to address these challenges. The project expanded the 
government’s reform program to 50 additional schools, and supported professional development of 
teachers, renovations of 42 schools, and development and distribution of textbooks, particularly in 
minority languages. At the end of the project, 75% of teachers in supported schools were observed 
employing new skills and knowledge in the classroom, which, as a proxy indicator, represented the 
accomplishment of the first CPS outcome related to education quality. The share of textbooks arriving at 
the start of the academic year also increased from 17% in 2005 to 100% in 2009, and 98% of students 
were observed using project-supported textbooks in class. To lay the groundwork for more systematic 
assessment of education quality, MERP facilitated Montenegro’s participation in the Programme for 
International Student Assessment (PISA), and development of a standardized exit exam for secondary 
school. In addition, MERP provided capacity building to the MOES and BES to improve their planning 
and budgeting in line with the Government’s medium-term expenditure framework, which helped these 
institutions to provide on-time annual budgets to the MOF. MERP supported development of a plan to 
eliminate arrears, which was achieved in 2009, satisfying the CPS outcome on use of budgetary resources. 
Strengthened financial performance also led to an increase in non-salary current expenditure from 5.4% 
of the total state primary and secondary budget in 2005 to 15% in 2009. Given these successes, MERP 
received the Improving Lives of People in ECA Award. In particular, the Montenegrin model of teacher 
training is now considered “good practice” and a model for replication. 

50. 
In addition, the Bank provided selected capacity building activities to support higher 
education. Swiss Trust funds supported TA on higher education financing (FY07), higher education 
quality assurance (FY08), and implementation of the Bologna European Credit Transfer and 
Accumulation System (ECTS) (FY08). The first activity included a high level workshop and the second 
and third hands-on workshops. All three activities led to reports that were well received by ministry and 
university officials, and that provide excellent bases for possible future assistance. 

51. The Bank’s engagement in the education sector offers lessons concerning program design, 
monitoring, and education assessment. MERP’s success was partially driven by strong country 
ownership a good design that accounted for the needs of different demographics. For example, grouping 
the schools into “reform cohorts” allowed the project to tailor support to specific areas, such as small 
schools in mountainous regions. The establishment of a project steering committee (PSC) comprising 
stakeholders and donors provided a highly effective mechanism for strategic planning, donor 
coordination, and monitoring of sector performance. Recognizing the PSC’s value, the Government 
continued the PSC after the MERP closed. Establishing a common understanding on M&E mechanisms 
and the use of monitoring data was crucial to project success, and M&E workshops for government and 
other actors should be considered for future projects early during project execution. Finally, international 
assessments such as the PISA can be important tools in countries without baseline data, as similar 
countries can be used as comparators. 

Country Priority: Improve quality efficiency and patient satisfaction of health services 

52. World Bank assistance over the CPS aimed to improve the efficiency and quality of primary 
health care (PHC) services and to strengthen the management and financial performance of the 
national health insurance system. These goals were designed to address deficiencies in health care 

52 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Montenegro FY07-10 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 

coverage, particularly inadequate access to preventative care, weak and fragmented coordination of health 
services, and low patient satisfaction. In addition, the financial sustainability of the healthcare system was 
undermined by deficits in the national Health Insurance Fund (HIF), which were attributable to weak 
revenue collection, high expenditures relative to economic circumstances, notably on pharmaceuticals and 
an overly generous benefit package, and fragmented regulatory and monitoring systems that impeded 
effective management of the sector.  

53. The FY04 Montenegro Health Systems Improvement Project (MHSIP) made substantial 
progress on its key objectives and CPS outcomes, though more efforts are now needed to expand 
primary health care services outside the Capitol city. The MHSIP, which strongly oriented its 
investments toward Podgorica, provided assistance to define a new primary care benefit package, train 
hundreds of healthcare personnel [in primary care], construct or renovate five health facilities, and 
introduce a more efficient model of care based on choosing a primary care doctor. As a result of MHSIP-
supported reforms and other activities, PHC utilization rates in Podgorica rose from 11.4% in 2004 to 
nearly 35% in 2008, with solid gains among the marginalized Roma population. Consultation and waiting 
times for PHC services also fell dramatically, and patients expressing complete or partial satisfaction with 
PHC services rose from 82% in 2004 to 97% in 2008. In addition, MHSIP supported the development and 
adoption of bylaws and policies to improve pharmaceutical management, the delivery of care, and the 
operations of the HIF. To improve management of the sector, a new information system was developed 
sharing critical performance data between the HIF, healthcare providers, and the pharmaceutical supply 
chain, though the integration of this system with hospitals is pending. Owing to these and other activities, 
the HIF decreased the share of expenditures on pharmaceuticals from 19.2% in 2004 to 16.3% in 2008. 
More to the point, operating deficits within the HIF were eliminated in 2006 and 2007, and a surplus of a 
€10.9 million was achieved in 2008. In light of the project’s successes, the Government requested in late 
2009 additional financing of $7.1 million to, inter alia, expand PHC services outside Podgorica, and 
continue strengthening health sector institutions, particularly information systems and quality assurance 
programs. 

54. A few lessons can be drawn from implementation of the MHSIP. As with other projects, some 
activities of MSHIP were delayed by the dissolution of the TSU, which again highlights the critical role 
of adequate fiduciary support to project execution. Difficulties coordinating aspects of the PHC reforms 
among myriad agencies suggest that identifying a single champion agency with adequate clout to promote 
project objectives is a wise tactic (whenever possible). In addition, MSHIP highlights the benefits of 
building flexibility into project design. During project execution, certain agencies within Podgorica 
expressed a higher degree of resistance to implementation of reforms. The project’s reorientation, 
particularly in its proposed additional financing, toward supporting PHC services outside the capitol 
illustrates a flexible approach that has facilitated project success.  

Country Priority: Improve the fiscal sustainability of the pension system 

55. The Government requested World Bank support over the CPS to improve the financial 
sustainability, effectiveness, and efficiency of Montenegro’s pension system. Linked to the 2003 
Pension and Disability Law, these priorities entailed building relevant capacity and operational linkages 
among the key institutions of the pension system, including the Directorate of Public Revenues (DPR), 
the Pension and Disability Fund (PIO), and the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (MOLSA). Given 
weak collection of pension revenue and fragmented management of data and benefits among pension 
agencies, the CPS aimed to strengthen pension administration and the collection of PIT and social 
contributions. Given inadequate capacity in actuarial analysis and projections, which risked undermining 
the efficiency of pension programs, the CPS sought to strengthen capacity in pension monitoring, 
analysis, and identification of reform options. Finally, the CPS prioritized establishing a “third pillar” 

53 

 
 
 
 
 
Montenegro FY07-10 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 

framework providing options for voluntary private pensions, with a view to broadening the scope of 
pension offerings to meet public demand.  

56. Substantial advances in all these outcomes were achieved with the support of the FY04 
Pension System Administration Investment Project (PSAIP). Capacity building provided by PSAIP 
helped to significantly improve pension administration, leading to a reduction in the days required to 
process pension registrations in the DPR from 5 days in 2004 to 3 in 2010. In line with expectations under 
the CPS, new IT equipment and software were introduced in the PIO and DPR to build an integrated 
contribution and collections system, and most software modules are operational in the PIO (however, 
some additional work remains to link the DPR’s system to Montenegro’s social funds, and to permit 
tracking of individual and not just aggregated pension data in new organizations). Most importantly, these 
and other reforms helped to improve the financial solvency of the pension system by increasing 
collections from €106 million in 2004 to €218 million in 2010. Assistance under PSAIP significantly 
increased capacity in pension design and analysis within MOLSA. PSAIP supported the development of 
an actuarial model for the pension system, and 13 staff members were trained in employing the model in 
pension analysis and forecasting. As expected, Montenegro approved a “third pillar” law supporting 
voluntary pensions and enacted 11 related bylaws, and PSAIP trained staff in the Securities Commission 
on supervising private pension funds. 

57. However, a few lessons can be distilled from PSAIP concerning the importance of government 
ownership, fiduciary support, and skilful project leadership. The efforts to build a unified 
contribution and collection system were slowed by insufficient cooperation among the implementing 
agencies (DPR, MIO, MOLSA), particularly in linking the system to Montenegro’s social funds. More 
broadly, these agencies’ relatively separate operations and lack of previous experience working together 
rendered cooperation throughout the project more difficult than originally envisaged. Looking forward, 
careful assessment of the commitment of implementing agencies is indicated, particularly when multiple 
actors are involved in project outcomes. As in other projects, understaffing in the TSU slowed 
procurement of key purchases, such as IT equipment, and necessitated hiring separate procurement 
officers. On the positive side, PSAIP was headed by a strong and skilled project director (the current 
Minister of Finance). His able leadership and substantial clout partially mitigated delays and helped to 
accelerate data sharing among agencies and inter-agency cooperation. His role also highlights the 
importance of high-level leadership to project success when an operation involves multiple layers of 
government. Of note, PSAIP’s closing date was extended from March 31 to September 30, 2010 to allow 
for the procurement of delayed IT equipment and the testing and functionality of the integrated 
contribution and collection system.  

Portfolio Assessment 

D. Bank Performance 

58. With a few exceptions, lending over FY07-10 generally adhered to the original CPS plan. The 
CPS supported four ongoing lending operations from the previous CAS period, including the FY02 
Emergency Stabilization of Electricity Supply Project (ESESP), which closed in FY07, and the MESTAP, 
MHSIP, PSAIP, and MERP. New investment loans in the energy, tourism, and agriculture sectors were 
approved as originally programmed (see Annex 3), along with a GEF program in FY08 supporting 
management of Lake Skadar. However, the LAMP, originally planned for FY08, was approved in FY09 
as additional dialogue was needed on safeguards issues related to its land management components. 
Additional financing for MSTDP in FY08 was dropped due to uncertainties on the Government’s 
commitment to protection on the Bojana Delta, as was the GEF Tara Lim operation, though parts of the 
former were subsumed into MIDAS.  

54

59. Key portfolio indicators were generally sound, though disbursements fell dramatically in 
FY10 due to an interruption in implementation support and the slow start-up of new projects, and 
overall performance was weakened by one problem project: MESTAP. The portfolio fluctuated from 
5 lending projects totaling US$34 million in commitments in 2007 to 8 projects totaling US$80.5 million. 
The disbursement ratio in the first three years of the CPS was strong and well above the ECA average of 
17.8%, peaking at 41% in FY09 due to strong disbursement in several projects before their closure. For 
example, MERP had a 40% disbursement ratio in FY09 and MSTDP a 90% ratio before its cancellation, 
mainly due to high disbursements on its regional water supply component. The disbursement ratio 
plummeted in FY10 to 11.8% owing to the dissolution and slow re-establishment of the TSU, the 
inexperience of new line ministry and PIU staff in processing Bank projects, and, to some extent, 
inadequate responsiveness from the Bank. In addition, MESTAP was classified as a problem project and 
an “at-risk” commitment throughout the CPS because of problems in finding politically acceptable sites 
for the landfill components. As the lending portfolio expanded, overall commitments at risk declined from 
about 20% in FY07 to 9% in FY10. Proactivity was 100% in FY07 and FY08, but dropped to 0% in 
FY09 and FY10 given continuing problems in resolving local political issues concerning location of the 
landfills. Average project supervision and preparation costs from FY07 to FY10 were below ECA 
averages.

Quality 

60. The quality of most lending operations was generally high, though, as noted, the performance 
of a few operations deteriorated owing due to fiduciary hurdles and difficulties managing the 
interests of relevant stakeholders. Most lending interventions maintained satisfactory ratings in 
Implementation Progress (IP) and Development Objective (DO) throughout the CPS period, which 
reflected the timeliness and relevance of the Bank’s interventions and the mostly effective operations of 
PIUs. However, ratings dropped below satisfactory in certain projects. The PSAIP’s DO rating has fallen 
to moderately satisfactory due to delays in procuring IT equipment associated with the TSU’s dissolution. 
MESTAP’s IP and DO ratings have dropped to moderately unsatisfactory and moderately satisfactory, 
respectively, due to the complications on its landfill components mostly attributable to stakeholder 
disagreements. MSTDP faced significant performance problems and ultimately cancellation given the 
aforementioned halt in progress on establishing a protected area on the Bojana Delta amid diverging 
stakeholder interests. 

61. As discussed in the section on CPS results, the dissolution of the TSU clearly impacted the 
implementation and performance of the portfolio; nonetheless, its continued operation is justified 

55 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Montenegro FY07-10 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 

given limitations in local fiduciary capacity. The MOF created the TSU in 2005 as cost-effective and 
pragmatic means of addressing inadequate fiduciary capacity and providing effective and centralized 
management of credit proceeds. Initially established for the MHSIP, the TSU was expected to help 
Montenegro grow a talented pool of fiduciary specialists who could be retained after the closure of Bank-
financed projects, rather than hiring temporary, costly, and often foreign consultants to support individual 
projects. The TSU provided effective support to Bank projects through 2008. In February 2009, the MOF 
sought to renew the expiring contracts of the original three staff and add additional specialist(s) given a 
predicted increase in workload after the approval of new Bank projects. However, the original staff 
requested a near doubling of their original salaries, claiming that they could handle the increased work 
without necessarily expanding the unit. Viewing these demands as untenable, the MOF allowed the 
contracts of the original staff to expire and opted to open recruitment in April 2009 for all four positions, 
a process which took several months as qualified local candidates were in short supply, in turn impeding 
the processing of several Bank projects including MHSIP, MEEP, PSAIP, LAMP, and MIDAS. Even 
when fully operational, the TSU does have drawbacks, namely a degree of isolation from individual PIUs 
and risks that staff turnover and inadequate coordination might affect its services. However, given a clear 
shortage of appropriately skilled staff in line ministries and the need to ensure effective project 
management, the continued operation of the TSU is warranted, though close oversight from the Bank and 
the MOF is indicated. 

62. To some degree, project implementation delays can also be attributed to counterparts’ 
inexperience in implementing Bank projects and select instances of inadequate responsiveness from 
the Bank. LAMP, MIDAS, and MEEP—all of which were approved in FY09—are being implemented 
by Ministries and PIU staff with limited or no experience with Bank projects. Lack of experience and 
familiarity with Bank procedures has at times led to unexpected delays in the delivery of documents from 
government agencies, and instances where the Bank needed to request more information to ensure 
documents align to Bank standards. The responsiveness of the Bank to client requests and project 
supervision across the portfolio have also at times fallen short. In some cases, aide-memoires (AM) for 
supervision missions have not been completed, or were delayed past associated “action plan” deadlines. 
Further, Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) have not always been completed on time, and the Bank 
has sometimes taken too long to acknowledge client requests. Supervision from the Bank has improved 
under new AM and ISR policies, but, taken together, these factors have partly contributed to slow 
implementation and disbursement and reveal areas for continued improvement over the next CPS period.  

63. No formal QAG reviews were undertaken of Montenegro projects, but two project 
implementation status reports (ISRs) were subject to a review by ECA Quality, and IEG reviewed 
the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) of the FY03 Emergency Stabilization of Electricity 
Supply Project (ESESP). According to ECA Quality’s review in December 2009, the ISRs for the 
ECSEE APL3 and MERP scored generally average on overall quality: 2.8 and 2.4, respectively, on a 5 
point scale. However, areas for improvement included better defining project indicators and ensuring 
links to PDOs, and enhancing the realism in project ratings. The FY03 ESESP, which focused on 
strengthening the financial management of the EPCG and improving power distribution by, inter alia, 
installing automatic electric meters, closed in June 2007 a month after the publication of the CPS. IEG’s 
ratings of ESESP were the same as those in ICR. IEG remarked that the ICR was clear and contained all 
the needed elements to evaluate the project. Recommendations for improvement concerned minutiae, 
such as more clearly labeling the costs of the project components in the ICR. 

64. The quality and design of the Bank’s knowledge products were strong. The Bank supported a 
strong package of demand-driven ESW and TA programs, particularly to diagnose and respond to fiscal 
and economic challenges before and after the crisis, build capacity in poverty measurement and in 
banking supervision, and analyze the potential for transport and energy investments using public-private 
partnerships. No formal quality reviews were undertaken of these products, but interviews with Bank 

56 

 
 
 
 
Montenegro FY07-10 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 

teams suggest that the products were useful to government authorities and used to shape policies. 
Evidence of the quality of Bank interventions included government requests for follow-up TA after 
delivery of ESW, notably for the FY08 PEIR and FY09 PEFA. However, changing government priorities 
before and after the crisis led to a few products planned in the CPS and CPSPR being dropped, including 
an FY10 Country Economic Memorandum, as well as the addition of new products in the business 
environment and financial sector.  

65. Though small, the CPS’s trust fund portfolio provided valuable assistance to complement 
lending and grant-financed operations, mainly to support outcomes in agriculture, finance, 
infrastructure, and education. Total commitments of Recipient-executed TFs over FY07-10 reached 
US$8.1 million, dominated by a US$4 million GEF operation supporting agro-environmental activities 
under MIDAS. Bank-executed TF commitments reached US$1.5, and included the two FIRST initiatives 
supporting corporate financial reporting and risk assessment in the banking sector, and operations funded 
by the Public Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) analyzing opportunities for public-private 
partnerships in the transport sector. Small grants from Canada and Switzerland supported, respectively, 
[analysis of the health sector], and dialogue on higher education financing and quality assurance. Amid 
changing government priorities, some expected TF programs, such as a planned GEF program supporting 
the Tara and Lim river basin watershed, were cancelled. Disbursements of TF activities were [add trend]. 
In general, the use of TFs enabled the CPS to harness additional resources and targeted expertise in key 
areas beyond those available through traditional channels, and continued selective use of TFs is indicated 
for the next CPS.  

Country Dialogue and Aid Coordination  

66. The Bank opened a country office in June 2007 and worked with Montenegro during its post-
independence state-building phase. The Bank confronted a number of challenges related to portfolio 
implementation, including: (i) insufficient ownership for projects inherited from the state union of Serbia 
and Montenegro; (ii) the lack of established lines of communication between the Central Government and 
municipalities, initially worsened by the implementation of the Law on Local Self-Government; and (iii) 
administrative constraints and a lack of knowledge and experience in collaborating with Bank teams. The 
successful establishment of close, day-to-day contacts with key counterparts in the Finance and line 
ministries and intensive dialogue on operational issues—such in the Montenegro Environmentally 
Sensitive Tourist Areas Project—significantly allayed these constraints while laying the groundwork for 
possibly scaling up support. The client perceives the Bank as competent (albeit cumbersome and 
complicated) counterpart, which is sought for guidance and advice in difficult situations. Despite its 
resource constraints, the Country Office succeeded in establishing a field presence capable of placing 
project support into a broader perspective, contributing to the increased ownership of the current project 
portfolio. 

67. The coordination between the Government and the donor community—or among donors—
has been sporadic (except possibly on SAA and defense-related challenges, which are both outside the 
direct Bank mandate). The Government has not taken the initiative to organize regular donor meetings on 
political levels. Most bilateral and multilateral representations have focused on establishing their own 
presence, and not pushed the donor coordination agenda. However, donor coordination on a project level 
has worked well and proven effective, such as in the MIDAS project. Bilateral coordination among 
donors largely hinges on personal relations between the heads of offices.

D. Lessons Learned 

68. 
The FY07–10 CPS Completion Report identified a number of lessons related to the 
overall strategy, project implementation, and Bank and borrower performance that are helping to 
guide the new CPS program. Key lessons are noted below: 

 The CPS’s provision of selective, mutually reinforcing interventions supporting Montenegro’s 
own goals produced solid results, while maximizing the impact of the Bank’s scarce resources. 
The portfolio’s knowledge products, technical assistance, lending programs, and regional grant 
programs leveraged synergies among World Bank Group institutions (i.e, IBRD and IFC), donors, 
and domestic stakeholders. Analytical products such as the FY07 FSAP and ROSC and FY08 PEIR 
were particularly valuable in diagnosing challenges and developing follow-up TA as well as the 
proposed development policy lending for FY11 and FY12.  

 The Bank’s suite of ESW and analytical reports covering economic and fiscal matters were 
critically important in identifying needed reforms in a newly-independent country, and the 
acquired knowledge helped to identify key areas for follow-up work. The analysis in the FY07 
ROSC, FY09 PEIR, and FY09 PEFA helped to illuminate key challenges and policy 
recommendations, which led to deeper engagement with the Bank on public expenditure 
management and a Government request for follow-up technical assistance. 

 The increase in the number of (relatively small) projects in the Bank’s portfolio by the end of the 
last CPS period may have strained Montenegro’s scarce implementation capacity as well as 
limited the Bank’s ability to maintain a robust country-specific AAA program given the need to 
allocate scarce resources to project supervision. Going forward, the Bank should seek to 
consolidate the portfolio focusing on fewer, larger lending interventions. A robust program of AAA 
will also be essential to help build capacity and provide specialized analytical support in key areas. 

 Leveraging regional experiences and programs is important, particularly in a small country with 
limited Bank engagement. To some extent, the Bank’s success in Montenegro was facilitated by 
framing country needs within a regional context, and by leveraging solutions and products that had 
been tested and proven successful in neighboring countries. For example, the Land Administration, 
Energy Efficiency and Agriculture Institutions projects were all modeled on successful IBRD 
operations in neighboring countries. Similarly, the Government’s decision to retain IFC as an 
advisor on the Bar-Boljare motorway and the Moraca Hydropower project was partly motivated by 
IFC’s success in the energy sector in Albania. The Bank and IFC should continue to leverage 
regional programs and experiences whenever possible. 

 Careful assessment and monitoring of the interests of government agencies and local 
stakeholders are critical during project preparation and implementation, particularly when 
operations involve different levels of government. Complications in MSTDP and MESTAP were 
partly driven by the Bank’s underassessment of diverging views on project goals among 
municipalities, stakeholders, and central government. Close monitoring of interests and open 
communications between the Bank and stakeholders at all levels of government are crucial to avert 
project implementation issues downstream.  

 Though the continued use of the Technical Services Unit (TSU)—a central unit providing 
financial management and procurement services to most Bank-financed operations -- is perhaps 
unavoidable given the extreme shortage of these implementation skills in Montenegro, improved 
oversight of its operations is needed to avoid project delays. The use of a central TSU entails some 

58 

 
 
 
 
Montenegro FY07-10 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 

risks deriving from the TSU’s isolation from line ministries and PIUs, the difficulties of prioritizing 
among competing demands from “client” projects, and the risk of paralysis across several projects 
in the event of a major staff turnover as occurred in mid-2009. To mitigate these issues, the 
government and the Bank are trying to improve the stability and operations of the TSU through 
introducing periodic workload and staffing assessments, and improving communications between 
the TSU and project beneficiaries. 

69. Though Montenegro became an IFC member only in 2006, a few preliminary conclusions and 
lessons can be drawn from its engagement: 

 Though IFC’s overall engagement was strong, the global economic crisis and to some degree a 
lack of diversified instruments reduced involvement in the tourism sector. IFC achieved 
significant results in Montenegro, particularly in promoting retail commerce, building awareness 
of international business standards, and attracting private sector capital in infrastructure. 
However, proposed investments in sustainable tourism failed to materialize due to lowered 
interest from foreign investors during the economic crisis, and IFC’s lack of tailored and regional 
products supporting tourism.  

 As in many small countries, IFC’s success in Montenegro was facilitated by framing country 
needs in a regional context and leveraging solutions and products that had been tested and 
proven successful in neighboring countries. For example, the Government’s decision to retain 
IFC as an advisor on the Bar-Boljare motorway and the Moraca Hydropower project was partly 
motivated by IFC’s success in the energy sector in Albania. In addition, IFC tapped into a 
regional approach for investments, such as supporting a regional microfinance fund that promoted 
small business growth in the country.

Doing Business ranked Montenegro 81st of 
178 countries in the ease of doing business in 
2008. The Government identified policy 
priorities and reforms to strengthen the 
financial sector with support of the joint

Status at Completion 
EU Accession Agenda on track and 
benchmarks achieved. Montenegro submitted 
an application for EU membership in 
December 2008 and completed an EU 
questionnaire in late 2009, as well as an 
additional set of questions in early 2010. The 
questionnaire’s score confirmed good progress 
on EU benchmarks, though governance, crime, 
and corruption remain key concerns. 
The economic crisis and weak external 
demand led to a 6.6% contraction of GDP and 
a fiscal deficit in 2008 and 2009. Credit faces 
negative growth and banks are vulnerable from 
weak assets and declining liquidity. Negative 
growth is expected in2010 followed by around 
5% growth through 2012. 
Montenegro’s ease of doing business ranking 
improved ten places to 71st. The Government 
significantly strengthened regulation and 
supervision of the financial sector, including 
amending the Law on Banks and approving 
laws to strengthen the Central Bank, protect 
deposits, and resolve troubled financial 
institutions. 

Lessons Learned 
The Bank’s analytical work helped 
the government to diagnose and 
respond to challenges. Lending 
projects, such as MIDAS, are 
helping to boost standards in line 
with EU requirements. Bank support 
on governance may be warranted in 
the next CPS. 

The extent of the crisis and its 
contagion on Montenegro was 
unexpected and uncertain. In a 
deteriorated fiscal climate, DPL 
support may be warranted to help 
reestablish growth and fiscal health. 

The Bank’s engagement under the 
FSAP and knowledge activities 
provided targeted and highly useful 
support to diagnose and respond to 
deficiencies in the business climate 
and financial sector. 

The economic crisis is expected to 
have a negative impact on poverty 
and employment, though 
Montenegro’s ongoing steps to 
improve education, health, and 
social services are expected to 
improve competitiveness over the 
medium-term. 

Improved 
standards of living 
for citizens 

Montenegro’s poverty rate was 14.5% in 
2006. Unemployment reached 14.5% in July 
2008.  

The most recent available data indicate that 
poverty fell to 8% in 2007 and unemployment 
to 13.2% in July 2009. However, contraction 
of GDP under the economic crisis is expected 
to lead to an uptick in the poverty rate, 
possibly to between 9.5-13.9%.

CPS Outcomes 
Status at Completion 

Government capacity in fiscal and economic 
affairs was strengthened; the Bank enhanced 
capacity by completing a PEIR and CEM and 
presenting recommendations on growth and 
fiscal reforms to government. 

The Statistical Office of Montenegro 
(MONSAT) enhanced its use of HBS data and 
developed HBS-based poverty profiles for 
2005 and 2006. MONSAT’s coordination with 
the MOF and Ministry of Labor was 
strengthened. A regional study was undertaken 
of social safety nets in Western Balkan 
countries, including Montenegro. 

Assessments undertaken of PFM and fiduciary 
controls, and recommendations developed and 
shared with authorities.  

The legal and institutional framework for PPPs 
in infrastructure was upgraded, including 
adoption of a new Concessions Law. 
Independent feasibility studies were completed 
for major transport corridors that considered 
PPPs. Use of PPPs was increased, such as for 
the Bar-Boljare motorway and energy 
generation. 

Management capacity to improve road safety 
was enhanced by developing an analytical 
study and sector recommendations; two pilot

Lessons Learned 

The Bank’s analytical assistance was 
particularly valuable to a new 
country environment and to 
catalyzing other engagement. 

The Bank’s approach of combining 
targeted trainings on poverty 
measurement with appropriate 
documentation was successful. 
Montenegro now needs to develop a 
national poverty line and upgrade 
the quality of HBS data. 

Analytical and advisory assistance 
from PPIAF and IFC enhanced 
Montenegro’s capability to structure 
PPPs and public concessions. IFC 
will continue work in these areas in 
the next CPS.

Strengthened solid 
waste and water 
services in coastal 
areas 

Coastal areas had deficient solid waste 
services. Some waste from Kotor, Budva, 
Tivat, Bar, and Ulcinj was being improperly 
disposed, sometimes at unsanitary dumping 
sites. 

Water connections in coastal areas were 
insufficient to support growth and 
development of tourism; certain targeted 
coastal areas had only 12-hour water 
services.

implemented. 
Two unsanitary landfills were closed and a 
new sanitary landfill and waste management 
company were established serving Kotor, 
Budva, and Tivat (though this landfill was 
closed after a short period of operations after 
Kotor failed to license its use as a long-term 
landfill). The construction of a second sanitary 
landfill serving Bar and Ulcinj is expected in 
the next CPS period. The percent of solid 
waste in targeted coastal cities disposed of in 
proper facilities increased from 0% in 2004 to 
65% in 2010. 

60% of a new regional water supply (RWS) 
scheme was completed serving coastal 
municipalities, and several thousand 
households were connected to piped water and 
improved water sources. Upon completion, the 
RWS is expected to provide 24 hour water 
supply service. 

Background study completed on protection of 
the Bojana Delta. Diverging viewpoints among 
municipalities, stakeholders and government 
on the extent of environmental protection 
stalled progress on establishing a protected 
area. 

Strengthened 

64 

landfill and slow progress on the the 
second landfill serving Bar and 
Ulcinj were largely due to municipal 
conflicts on site locations, which 
highlight the need to consider 
country ownership and political 
factors in project design and 
execution. Most of the gain in waste 
disposal was due to new legislation 
requiring cities to dispose of waste 
sanitarily, and cities transporting 
waste to landfills in Podgorica. 

Good progress on the RWS, though 
its construction was modestly 
delayed by seasonal weather and 
technical issues with underwater 
sections in Lake Skadar.  

When dealing with project outcomes 
that are politically controversial 
and/or subject to multiple 
stakeholders, it is critical that the 
Bank accurately assess the degree of 
realism in achieving outcomes, and 
consider mandating evidence of 
commitment beyond simple 
declarations or inclusion in the 
project agreements. In MSTDP’s 
case, the government agreed to 
protection of the Bojana Delta at the 
outset of the operation, but the on-
the-ground reality proved untenable 
to realizing this outcome.

electricity supply in 
Mojkovac and 
Andreijevica 

Improved energy 
efficiency in the 
public sector 

Communication linkages between 
Montenegro’s energy utility (EPCG) and 
regional utilities were inadequate to manage 
power loads and cross-border trade of 
energy. 

Communication linkages were significantly 
enhanced; optical groundwire connections 
were established with power utilities in Bosnia 
(connections pending with Serbia). 

Residents and businesses in the Mojkovac 
and Andreijevica regions experienced 
frequent power cuts and disruptions owing to 
weak capacity in electricity transmission. 

Construction of additional transmission line 
circuits for the Mojkovac and Andreijevica 
substations completed (data on reduced power 
disruptions expected in late 2010). 

Public sector facilities had inefficient energy 
use and failed to harness energy-saving 
retrofits that could reduce consumption. 

Detailed energy audits completed for several 
public facilities and retrofitting of two schools 
underway; 5-6 public facilities expected to be 
retrofitted by end-2010. 

Pillar 2. Build Institutions and the Rule of Law 
Streamlined land 
In 2008, 86 days were needed to register 
registration and 
property and 6 months to issue construction 
business licensing 
permits. Ease of doing business ranking was 
81 of 178 countries according to the Doing 
Business reports. 

In 2010, 86 days needed to register property 
(no change) and 230 days needed to issue a 
construction permit (deterioration). Ease of 
doing business ranking was 71 of 183 
countries. 

Reduced economic 
risks associated 
with rapid credit 
growth 

Credit grew explosively in 2006 and 2007 by 
139% and 176%, respectively, underpinned 
by substantial foreign borrowings. FSAP 
identified risks associated with credit growth 
and proposed reforms to mitigate 
imbalances. Public holdings in the financial 
sector risked inefficiencies and conflicts of 
interest. 

Economic crisis of 2008/09 magnified 
imbalances and credit contracted by 15% by 
December 2009 (y-y). In line with the FSAP 
and to respond to the crisis, the government 
proposed and approved reforms on bank 
provisioning and capital requirements, and 
improved banking supervision and oversight 
from the Central Bank. The government also 
divested public holdings in the financial sector. 

though there was some concern 
about resettlement issues at sites for 
transmission line circuits. In 
retrospect, citing arrangements for 
siting in the project agreement may 
have smoothed project 
implementation. 

MEEP’s use of individual contracts 
for retrofitting was a good design 
feature, as lumping all retrofits into a 
single contract risks slowing project 
activities if a serious procurement 
issue arises. 

LAMP was postponed until FY09 
and has not yet made significant 
gains. Outcomes related to 
construction permitting and real 
estate registration are expected in the 
next CPS period. 

The crisis underlined with urgency 
of rapid adoption of measures to 
strengthen the banking sector amid 
increasing shares of non-performing 
loans, liquidity problems, banking 
losses, and drops in deposits.

actions 

Financial sector

Corporate auditing 
and financial

requirements 
updated. 

Montenegro suffered from limited capacity 
within the Central Bank to assess risks and 
develop responses.  

Regulations in the financial sector lacked 
harmonization with EU standards. 

The quality of corporate auditing and 
financial reporting practices was weak. 

Montenegro has significantly greater capacity 
to assess systemic risks in the banking sector; 
Bank credit risk model was developed and 
tested on selected banks.  

Financial sector regulations were upgraded, 
including adopting laws on protection of the 
Banking System and amending the Law on 
Accounting and Auditing to align with EU 
directives.  

An Action Plan to enhance the quality of 
corporate financial sector reporting has been 
developed and the government is 
implementing reforms.  

ESW and trust-funded programs 
provided instrumental and 
complementary support. The Bank 
and the IMF’s joint work on the 
FY07 FSAP helped to identify areas 
for reform in the financial sector, 
including follow-up Bank TA. The 
FY07 ROSC diagnosed critical 
challenges in financial and auditing 
standards and led to a FIRST-
supported program to develop the 
noted action plan on corporate 
financial reporting. FIRST also 
supported a successful grant to build 
capacity in risk assessment in the 
banking sector. This body of work 
has led to a proposed new DPL 
program for the next CPS period.

Agricultural standards and practices lacked

harmonization with EU standards. 
EU standards for 
agriculture and

Montenegro capacity to manage EU 
assistance in the rural sector was limited, 
particularly under the EU’s IPARD 
mechanism. 

Government developed and adopted a code of 
good practices and has taken initial steps to 
upgrade food and phytos-sanitary standards, 
such as accrediting veterinary labs.  

The FY09 MIDAS/GEF project is in 
its early stages and most outcomes 
related to rural development are 
expected in the next CPS period.

Unit. 

Teaching and instruction methods were 
outdated, and inadequate infrastructure and 
classroom materials impeded learning. 17% 
of textbooks arrived at the start of the 
academic year. 

Percentage of teachers in reform schools 
observed using new skills in classroom 
reached 75% in 2009, surpassing the 70% EOP 
value. Infrastructure in 42 reform schools was 
upgraded. 100% of textbooks arrived at the 
start of the academic year in 2009. 

Engagement under MERP was 
buoyed by strong country ownership 
and a design that grouped schools 
into “reform cohorts” that tailored 
support to specific areas, such as 
mountainous regions. MERP’s 
project steering committee was an 
effective mechanism for strategic 
planning, donor coordination, and 
monitoring. Establishing a common 
understanding on M&E was crucial 
to project success. MERP received 
the Improving Lives of People in 
ECA Award, and its model of 
teacher training is “good practice.” 

The FY04 MSHIP made good gains, 
but project execution was slowed by 
the dissolution of the TSU. The 
reorientation of MSHIP to areas 
outside Podgorica, particularly under 
its proposed additional financing, 
was a flexible project design feature 
that allowed it to contend with less 
responsiveness to reforms among 
Podgorica-based agencies.

Improved 
education quality

Improved use of 
budgetary 
resources in the 
education sector 

Strengthened 
efficiency and 
quality of primary 
health care 
services 

Weak planning in the MOES and BES and 
high expenditures and arrears in the primary 
and secondary education budget reduced the 
efficiency of resource use and threatened the 
system’s financial sustainability.  

Coverage and use of PHC services was 
limited and quality of care was inadequate. 
In 2004, the primary health care (PHC) 
utilization rate in Podgorica was 11.4%. 57% 
of patients in Podgorica expressed waiting 
times for PHC of 21 or more minutes. Only 
82% of patients in Podgorica expressed 
complete or partial satisfaction with PHC 
services. 

Strengthened 
management and 
financial 
performance of the 
national insurance 
system 

Sustainability of the national health care 
system was threatened by rising 
pharmaceutical costs and weak regulatory, 
management, and monitoring tools. In 2004, 
the HIF ran an operating deficit, and 
allocated a high 19.2% of its expenditures on 
pharmaceuticals. 

Capacity building was provided to MOES and 
BES to improve planning and budgeting in line 
with the government’s MTEF. Arrears in the 
education sector were eliminated by 2009. 
Non-salary current expenditure within the total 
state primary and secondary budget rose from 
5.4% in 2005 to 15% in 2009. 

New PHC benefit package was defined and a 
system introduced allowing patients to choose 
a PHC doctor. In 2008, PHC utilization rates in 
Podgorica rose to nearly 35%, with good gains 
among the Roma. Consultation and waiting 
times for PHC services fell dramatically, with 
only 34% of patients claiming wait times of 21 
or more minutes. 97% of patients expressed 
complete or partial satisfaction with PHC 
services 80% of targeted populations in 
Podgorica now have a chosen primary care 
doctor.  
HIF’s operating deficits were eliminated in 
2006 and 2007, and the share of HIF’s 
expenditures on pharmaceuticals fell to 16.3% 
in 2008.

Strengthened 
pension 
administration and 
collection of PIT 
and social 
contributions 

Financial sustainability of the pension 
system was undermined by administrative 
deficiencies, limited inter-agency 
cooperation, and weak collection and 
compliance. Pension revenue from 
contributions reached only €106 million in 
2004. 

Montenegro FY07-10 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 

A unified collection system was developed and 
linked to key agencies, such as the Directorate 
of Public Revenues (DPR) and the Pension and 
Disability Fund (PIO). The system is partially 
operational, though some IT equipment 
remains to be purchased for the DPR. The days 
to process pension registrations in the DPR fell 
from 5 in 2004 to 3 in 2010. Improved pension 
administration helped to boost pension 
contribution revenue to €218 million in 2010. 

A new actuarial model for pension system was 
developed; 13 staff members were trained in 
forecasting and pension analysis in the 
Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs. 

Dissolution of the TSU slowed 
execution of the PSAIP and 
procurement of IT equipment in 
2009. Lack of active cooperation 
among the key implementing 
agencies (DPR, PIO, MOLSA) in 
linking the unified collection system, 
particularly to social funds slowed 
progress, though a strong project 
director helped to keep momentum, 
mainly by monitoring milestones to 
achieve before a proposed extension 
of the project closing date. This 
project worked with numerous 
agencies that lacked familiarity with 
Bank procedures, and underlined the 
importance of striving to identify 
lead agencies with strong 
commitment and authority. 

Strengthened 
capacity in pension 
policy monitoring,

Third pillar 
framework 
established 
providing options 
for voluntary 
pensions.  

The capacity of staff within the Ministry of 
Labor and Social Affairs (MOLSA) was 
limited in monitoring and analyzing pension 
policies, and identifying needed reforms. 

Limited options for harnessing private 
savings for retirement left un-served a 
segment of the pension market.  

Third pillar law enacted establishing voluntary 
pension funds. Staff trained in the Securities 
Commission on supervision of pensions and

ANNEX 3: GENDER PROFILE  

Figure 1 below presents selected indicators of gender achievement, benchmarking Montenegro 
(in yellow) against the Western Balkans (in blue) and the ECA region (in red).6 As all figures are 
standardized to the ECA average it is easy to see the areas where Montenegro and the Western 
Balkans perform very differently from the rest of the region.

Health related indicators show Montenegro performing in line with other countries in the 
Western Balkans and more generally in ECA. While fertility is slightly higher than the regional 
average, almost all births are attended by skilled health staff as in the rest of the region. Female 
mortality overall is higher than in other Western Balkans countries but similar to mortality in the 
region. Interestingly as in Montenegro also male mortality (not shown) is lower than the ECA 
average, this indicator shows less gender disparities (advantage in this case) than in the rest of 
the region, in line with the rest of the Western Balkans. Maternal mortality stands out as 
particularly low with respect to neighboring countries and the region as a whole. On other 
dimensions of gender achievement, Montenegro performs in line with other countries in the 
region and in the Western Balkans, such as in terms of the share of women employed in the non-

6 The indicators presented are limited by data availability. For the sake of comparability the indicators refer to the 
latest year for which the indicators are available for the majority of the countries being compared. The data 
referred to in this figure, therefore, might not be the most updated for Montenegro.

agricultural sector. A large share of the female labor force (and almost 3.5 times of the ECA 
average) is however unemployed. Data from the latest enterprise survey (2009) complement this 
picture, showing the extent to which women face different challenges than men. While, for 
example, women represent more than 50 percent of the full time workers – a higher percentage 
than in the ECA region or in upper middle income countries overall – this is because they are 
more likely to be represented particularly in small firms and in firms in the service sector. 
Female participation in ownership remains however more limited than in those other groups of 
countries, and it trails behind particularly for large firms (4 percent, 35 percentage points behind 
the ECA average).  

Education data show that while in the past women had lower educational opportunities than men 
(more than four fifths of the illiterate population are women), currently there are no reported 
differences in primary completion rates for female to male enrollment in primary and secondary 
education. The ratio of female students in universities is high, 43 percent in 2005, with ratios 
exceeding 50 percent in key faculties (economics, law, medicine, biology, and philosophy). This 
suggests that at least some of the barriers that have been holding behind women in the labor 
force are currently being addressed, though continued disparities in land tenure, property 
ownership and inheritance practices may contribute to perpetuate gender disparities.
