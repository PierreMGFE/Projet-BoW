Executive Summary 

(i) 
The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Azerbaijan for FY11-14 has been prepared under the 
circumstances of a rapid increase in income and decrease in poverty, but also the global economic crisis 
from which the country has emerged relatively well.  But the drivers of growth and poverty reduction that 
served the country well in the recent past may not be available in the future, and the post-crisis world 
offers new challenges.  This CPS therefore focuses on those areas where development needs are likely to 
be the strongest, Government demand and commitment is visible, and the Bank‘s advantage is clear.  In 
this context, the CPS proposes a two pillar strategy of (i) building a competitive non -oil economy and (ii) 
strengthening social and municipal services; with a strong cross-cutting theme of governance and anti-
corruption. 

(ii) 
Azerbaijan faces a unique opportunity to propel itself into the ranks of a sustainable higher 
middle income country.  Its remarkable success in reducing poverty from 49 percent in 2001 to 16 percent 
in 2008 was largely driven by very high growth rates which averaged more than 20 percent for the period.  
This was complemented by a strong rise in wages and transfers, and a well -targeted social benefit system.  
However, much of the rapid growth stemmed from a large increase in oil and gas revenues which are now 
likely to plateau over the coming decade and decline thereafter. A key driver of economic growth may 
therefore not be available. At the same time, while Azerbaijan weathered the global economic crisis 
relatively well, the crisis has underlined the need for a diversified economy, market-based policies, and 
strengthened social services and support. As the Government prepares to meet these emerging needs and 
challenges, this World Bank Group strategy seeks to support the country in this endeavor. 

(iii) 
Over the course of the last CPS (FY07-10), the World Bank Group operations have had mixed 
results.  The best results came from helping the Government maintain a strong macro -framework, support 
health, education and social assistance modernization, and improve rural infrastructure, especially in 
irrigation.  Smaller operations in community development helped improve people‘s lives through lending 
to rural and IDP communities.  Strong results were also seen in expanding access to credit, in particular 
through IFC‘s support to banks and advisory services to promote the growth of the leasing sector and 
improved financial infrastructure.  Progress was made in improving the business environment, particularly 
on business registration. But significant work remains to be done in other areas of the business 
environment, especially with respect to permits and inspections, which deter private economic activity.  
Results have also been delayed in the larger infrastructure projects, especially roads, rail, and water supply 
and sanitation, where implementation has been slower, and in environment where limited progress has 
been made. Where performance was weak, there were several contributing factors including lack of project 
readiness, the rapid increase in lending ahead of implementation capacity, wavering Government 
ownership of projects, and an imbalance between lending and analytical work.  

(iv) 
As a result of learning from this experience, the CPS will seek to modify the Bank‘s approach in 
a number of ways.  The Bank will increase its focus on implementation of existing operations, and only 
consider new operations in selected areas with a strong record of sufficient institutional capacity.  The 
Bank will re-emphasize its focus on those areas where there is clear country demand and ownership.  
Special attention will be placed on ensuring that any new operation will be brought to the Board only when 
it is ready for immediate implementation.  The Bank will rebalance activities towards more analytical work 
and policy dialogue. And finally, the Bank will further strengthen its support for capacity building.   

(v) 
The specific areas of focus for the CPS build on the Governments own development strategies as 
evidenced in a variety of sector specific frameworks. The first pillar of the CPS focuses on strengthening 
the non-oil economy, primarily through an improved business environment, better infrastructure and 
agriculture improvements. The second pillar focuses on improving the effectiveness of social and 
community services, including health, education, social protection and water supply. All of these efforts 

i 

 
 
 
 
 
will need to be accompanied by capacity building and improved governance in order to improve  results.  
This will be a cross-cutting filter within the CPS. 

(vi) 
For the full CPS period the Government has requested a total IDA/IBRD lending envelope of 
about $1 billion.  Actual funding would be backloaded based on the principle of starting out modestly and 
adjusting lending volumes to performance.  Over FY11-12, lending is anticipated to amount to about $300 
million in IBRD, plus about $80 million in IDA in FY11.  FY11 is the last year of IDA, after which 
Azerbaijan will become IBRD-only. Funding levels in FY13-14 could be of similar amounts (or even 
larger), depending on Government demand and performance, IBRD's lending capacity and demand by 
other borrowers.  The lending level and program for the last two years of the CPS will be confirmed at the 
time of the CPS Progress Report.  IFC will seek to increase its investment program significantly to about 
$200 million during the CPS period. In addition to new lending, the CPS period is expected to see 
accelerated disbursements under existing projects.  

(vii) 
Bank lending will be complemented by a strong and enriched program of knowledge services. 
This would serve the dual purposes of informing country growth strategy and policy choices as well as the 
design of investment operations.  The Bank will increase its analytic work in the areas of job creation and 
growth, poverty and inequality, the financial sector, agriculture and irrigation, wastewater, and public 
expenditures.  The Government has agreed in principle to partner with the Bank with additional funding 
through a Joint Economic Research Program (JERP).  The Bank and the Government have also established 
a strong vehicle for policy dialogue in the high level policy forum held for the first time in 2009, and 
expected to continue during the CPS period.  IFC will continue to complement this with advisory services 
in the financial sector as well as improving the private sector business environment.  The Bank and the IFC 
will deepen their cooperation in these endeavors. 

(viii) The strategy described above is designed to channel funds in the most effective and prudent 
manner but  is not without risks.  The largest risks are associated with (i) social and political economy 
challenges as  Azerbaijan moves to  a new, more advanced  stage of  a competitive and diversified upper  
middle-income economy, (ii)  progress in improving institutional capacity being slower  than needed for 
increasingly more sophisticated governance requirements, (iii) implementation of existing portfolio, (iv) 
global economic uncertainties, and finally (v) regional security issues. Key elements of the CPS that will 
help to manage and moderate these risks are:  better calibration to client demands and capacity, stronger 
emphasis on analytical services, faster implementation of the existing portfolio, and cross-cutting filter of 
governance.

AZERBAIJAN – COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR FY11-14 

A. 

Introduction 

I. 

Country Context 

1. 
This Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Azerbaijan covers the four year period from FY11 to 
FY14.  It is a joint IDA/IBRD/IFC strategy, which builds on the complementarities of IFC and the Bank.  
The last Country Partnership Strategy for Azerbaijan was discussed by the Board in November 2006 
(Report No. 37812-AZ) and the CPS Progress Report in April 2008 (Report No. 42935-AZ). 

2. 
In recent years, Azerbaijan’s GDP has risen sharply and poverty has fallen dramatically, 
led by increasing oil revenues.  Oil sector growth was enabled by large off –shore investments that took 
place since 1995, and the construction of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline and Trans Caucasus Gas 
Pipeline which both came on stream in 2006, supported by growing oil prices.  Driven by the natural 
resource boom, Azerbaijan‘s GDP growth has averaged over 20 percent per year and GNI per capita 
(according to the World Bank‘s Atlas method) rose dramatically, from $1,270 in 2005 to $4,820 in 2009. 
Poverty dropped from about 49 percent in 2001 to 16 percent in 2008 (latest LSMS survey year).  Public 
investments and increased wealth of households has also led to double digit growth in the non-oil sectors.  
With a very low level of external debt to GDP (11 percent) and growing international reserves, it has 
achieved a remarkable level of creditworthiness in a short period of time.  Azerbaijan will fully graduate 
from IDA in FY11. 

3. 
Azerbaijan’s challenge is now to maintain its development momentum and to transform 
itself into a sustainable upper middle income economy. This will require two things.  First, Azerbaijan 
will need to adopt a more outward orientation to strengthen the non-oil economy and improve 
competitiveness.  Second, Azerbaijan will need to improve its capacity to make full and effective use of 
this increase in income – by improving skills and strengthening its institutions.  And there is urgency in 
strengthening competitiveness and capacity because projections indicate a leveling off of oil and gas 
production, and then decline, as currently identified oil and gas reserves will be drawn down over the 
coming 10-15 years.  It is in this context that the CPS for FY11-14 has been prepared – to build on 
lessons learned over the past four years and help Azerbaijan build capacity and a competi tive non-oil 
economy so that it can successfully make this transformation.  

B. 

Political Context 

4. 
The political situation within Azerbaijan is stable.  President Aliyev easily won re-election last 
year, and a Constitutional Referendum removed the two term limit for the Presidency.  Though polls 
show genuine support for President Aliyev, limitations on media and the civil society, and weak 
opposition parties, do not leave much space to work out and present alternatives , and the necessary socio-
political reforms have to come from the top, with all the risks attached to it.  The long-term framework 
may come under stress not so much from the political opposition per se but from whether the ―social 
contract‖ of continued improvement of life conditions for the broad social strata is able to be sustained.  
As incomes rise and spread within Azerbaijan, expectations for greater participation are likely to grow.   
In this context, developing mechanisms for greater accountability and social inclusion are taking on 
greater importance. 

5. 
The conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding regions remains frozen.  Armed 
conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh region in the early 1990s claimed 
some 30,000 lives and displaced up to a million Azerbaijanis. A ceasefire accord was signed in 1994, but 

1 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
peace talks have been fruitless so far and over 20 percent of Azerbaijan‘s territory remains under 
occupation. Sporadic clashes on the frontline have continued.  The Presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan 
have met many times over the past year on the outskirts of various international meetings but without 
apparent progress.   

6. 
At a global level, Azerbaijan has carefully balanced relations between the US, EU, Russia, 
and Turkey.  Azerbaijan is a strategically important country, both geographically as a key link in the E-
W and N-S trade corridors and in light of its oil and gas resources.  It is a CIS country as well as an EU 
―Eastern Partnership‖ country.  The EU has been keen to promote a new gas corridor - Nabucco - through 
which Azeri and Central Asian gas could be transited to Europe through Turkey.   Azerbaijan has been 
neither an initiator nor organizer of the Nabucco Project, but has indicated it could be a potential source 
of gas and a transit country.  At the same time, in June 2009, Azerbaijan entered into a deal to start selling 
gas to Russia in 2010, although the committed amounts are low.    

C. 

The Economic Environment 

7. 
Azerbaijan’s GDP grew by an average of over 20 percent per annum during 2005-09, 
primarily owing to the coming on stream of its new oil production.  The Government used a 
significant portion of the oil-related revenue to fund an ambitious public investment program, in order to 
strengthen its infrastructure and social services. Azerbaijan‘s approach was to both address its large 
infrastructure needs in order to provide a foundation for the non-oil economy, and to provide increased 
wages and social assistance in order to make a dent in poverty and raise incomes.  Public investment 
increased from AZN 0.5 billion in 2005 to AZN 4.6 billion in 2009. During the same time period, the 
wage bill increased by an average annual rate of 44 percent per year. Not surprisingly, soaring 
expenditures and wages contributed to an appreciation of the real exchange rate by about 60 percent 
between 2005 and 2009; inflation reach 20 percent in 2008, but receding below 2 percent in 2009 as 
prices collapsed during the crisis.   

8. 
The oil sector growth helped to support growth of an emerging  non-oil economy; the non-
oil economy grew at an average rate of 10 percent in 2005-2009. Agriculture grew on average at about 
4 percent a year, relying on fruits and vegetables, nuts, and wheat –the country benefits from having nine 
different climate zones, which creates ample opportunity for diversity in agricultural production.  Some 
non-oil industrial sectors, mostly light manufacturing, chemicals, and metals processing, grew in double 
digits as well through 2008 on the back of rising commodity prices--though in 2009 the majority of these 
industries suffered a contraction as commodities prices fell; the subsector grew at about 4 percent in 
2005-2009. As might be expected, Azerbaijan also underwent a construction boom, which marked 
double-digit growth despite the contraction in 2009.  Azerbaijan‘s service sectors have been booming as 
well, growing in double digits. Transportation also grew in part owing to the growth in trade, as 
Azerbaijan is a regional trading center.  Azerbaijan‘s communication sector grew at more that 25 percent 
a year, as new cellular operators entered the local market.  Wholesale and retail trade grew at about 14 
percent a year, and hotels and restaurants grew at about 25 percent a year. Services overall grew on 
average at 13 percent a year in 2005-2009. 

9. 
Azerbaijan’s high growth rates came alongside increasing oil reliance and early phases of 
Dutch Disease were emerging before the global crisis hit Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan‘s oil reliance 
increased gradually as oil prices rose through 2005, and thereafter more abruptly as production of new oil 
came on stream in 2006. The share of oil in GDP and the share of oil revenues in fiscal revenues reached 
51 percent and 66 percent in 2009, despite the fall of both ratios since their peak in 2008. The high oil 
revenues enabled public spending to increase relative to GDP, from 23 percent in 2005 to 35 percent in 
2009.  At the same time, the non-oil deficit increased in magnitude from about a third of total public 
spending to about two-thirds of total public spending between 2005 and 2009.  As a share of non-oil 

2 

 
 
 
 
 
 
GDP, the non-oil deficit increased from 13 percent in 2005 to about 39 percent in 2009; it was financed 
with oil revenues earned in US Dollars. The large foreign exchange inflows led to an appreciation of the 
real exchange rate by nearly 60 percent from 2005 to 2009, which together with structural impediments to 
trade and businesses has impacted competitiveness.  

10. 
Azerbaijan’s mechanisms for managing Dutch Disease were partially successful.  The most 
important element, establishing a well run Oil Fund capable of retaining excess resources has received 
international recognition.  To date the government has saved about half of its fiscal revenues from oil and 
gas in the Oil Fund (see Box 1). However, institutional and regulatory efforts to discipline public 
spending did not mature as planned.  Annual spending decisions on the draw-down from the Oil Fund to 
finance the consolidated budget are largely discretionary. They are not governed by a fiscal rule or a 
Medium Term Expenditure framework to help manage inevitable spending pressures generated by oil 
revenues. The high level of public spending helped push up domestic prices and discourage non-oil 
investment.  While non-oil exports have been increasing on nominal terms, as a share of non-oil GDP 
they have fallen from 10 in 2005 to about 5 percent in 2009.   

Box 1: The State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan (SOFAZ) 

The State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan (SOFAZ) is the cornerstone of the country‘s natural resource 
revenue management strategy.  It was established in 1999 with support from the IMF and the World 
Bank to accumulate excess oil and gas revenues.  SOFAZ governance, news and accounts are 
published on its web site www.oilfund.az.  Oil Fund expenditures are part of the consolidated budget 
approved by Parliament and executed through the single Treasury account.  Financial reports are 
disclosed and audited annually.  At end 2009, SOFAZ held $15 billion.  SOFAZ is recognized 
internationally for the high quality of its management. It received the 2007 UN Public Service Award, 
and in 2009 Azerbaijan was the first country to receive validation as compliant under the Extractive 
Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).  SOFAZ also received the highest rating for transparency by 
the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute in 2009.  In 2010 it announced that together with investment 
funds from the Netherlands, Korea and Saudi Arabia it would invest in the newly created African, 
Latin American and Caribbean Fund under the auspices of the IFC.  

11. 
Azerbaijan managed the 2009 global financial crisis well, though the weak places in the 
economy have begun to show.  Overall GDP growth for 2009 was 9.3 percent but mostly due to a 
recovery of oil prices and production following technical problems in 2008. However, the non-oil sector 
grew at 3.2 percent only, suffering a large contraction in construction and in the non-oil industry 
(especially chemicals and steal). Agriculture maintained a positive 3.5 percent growth in 2009, in part due 
to Government support following the food crisis.  In the light of uncertainty around the price of oil, the 
government‘s first reaction was to freeze the implementation of most new investment projects in the 
budget, and to reprioritize the recurrent budget towards supporting the social sectors, agriculture and 
utilities. The government also employed a strategy of: (i) containing contagion in the financial sector, by 
ensuring foreign obligations were met and strengthening bank supervision, (ii) enhancing access to credit 
by lowering key interest rates and supporting SMEs, (iii) continuing to fully fund the existing Targeted 
Social Assistance Scheme for the poor, and (iv) reducing the corporate tax rate by 2 percentage points, to 
20 percent.

12. 
The experience during the global economic crisis has highlighted the importance of 
strengthening the non-oil economy, particularly in light of the projected stabilization and 
subsequent decline in oil and gas revenues1  Chart 1 shows that non-oil economic growth, which had 
been buoyed indirectly by oil revenues, has declined from double digit growth for most of the decade 
(except 2005) to under 4 percent for the medium term.  Azerbaijan‘s two largest sources of GDP growth 
and fiscal revenues are from the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG) oil field and the Shah Deniz (SD) gas 
field. Chart 2 shows ACG oil production; it is likely to level off through 2016, and decline thereafter. 
With Turkey and Azerbaijan reaching agreement on the transmission price for SD Phase II gas in late 
May 2010, gas production may increase between  2014-2016 but flatten thereafter.2  Proven reserves are 
approximately 9 billion barrels of oil (mainly in the ACG field) and 1.34 trillion cubic meters of natural 
gas. Without an increase in oil and gas reserves, the country can no longer afford to rely on the oil sector 
to carry total GDP growth.  The need to establish new sources of growth beyond oil and gas revenues is 
therefore critical.  This transformation cannot prudently be put off much longer. 

1 Out of convention, oil GDP refers to the extraction of oil and gas throughout the document. 
2 FDI in the gas sector in the order of $2 billion is expected in 2011 -2012; delays in operationalizing the agreement 
between Azerbaijan and Turkey could push gas revenues further into the future.

Azerbaijan has made progress, notwithstanding the need to further strengthen its policy 
and institutional reforms.  Since 2001, the country has made significant progress and key achievements 
include:   
 The establishment and management of the Oil Fund, to preserve wealth for future generations and 
transparency in revenue flows.  
 
Introduction of some business facilitating mechanisms, such as a one stop shop for registration 
 
Improvement in health and basic education funding 
 Establishment of a well targeted social assistance program 
 
Improvements in Government institution and staff remuneration 
 
Investments in core infrastructure – power, roads, water, energy 

14. 
Creating a competitive non-oil economy will require deeper economic changes in a wide 
range of areas – in regulations and governance, infrastructure, skills, public institutions and in 
trade/FDI and macroeconomic policies.  The Competitiveness Index (see Figure 2 below) provided by 
the World Economic Forum provides an indication of the many facets of efforts needed.  Important 
efforts are underway on macro-economic stability, health, and primary education but there is a continuing 
agenda there. Other areas such as infrastructure, institutions, financial markets, technology, goods 
markets and higher education require more profound reforms.   And just as importantly, there is a need to 
maintain fiscal prudence and quality in public spending in line with the capacity of Azerbaijan to utilize 
funds efficiently and the capacity of the economy to absorb foreign exchange. The 2010 Doing Business 
ranking shows significant progress in some areas such as registering and starting a business and enforcing 
contracts, but continues to rate Azerbaijan low in three key areas: dealing with construction permits, 
paying taxes, and trading across borders.

Poverty and MDGs  

15. 
Azerbaijan’s high economic growth has translated into a sharp reduction in poverty.  The 
2008 Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) survey was undertaken by the Bank in collaboration 
with the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of the Population (MLSPP) and other Government 
agencies.  It shows that Azerbaijan‘s poverty rate has dropped from 49.6 percent in 2001 to an impressive 
15.8 percent in 2008.  Further, poverty rates have dropped significantly for both rural and urban 
populations (see Figure 3).  According to the same survey, by 2008, Azerbaijan‘s unemployment rate had 
fallen to 9 percent and the booming economy helped usher a significant number of women in the labor 
force, though unemployment among people aged 15-24 remains high at 16 percent. 

16. 
This reduction in poverty can be traced to the growing economy, a strong rise in wages, and 
a well targeted and easy to access social assistance program .   Between 2000 and 2008, the minimum 
wage increased by more than 6,700 percent from an extremely low level of AZN 1.1 to 75 per month 
(Figure 4). The average wage also grew in double digits per year and reached AZN 274.4 in 2008, 
compared with only AZN 44.3 in 2000, a cumulative increase of more than 650 percent.  Azerbaijan‘s per 
capita income (in real domestic prices) rose by over 30 percent in 2001-04 and further by more than 90 
percent during 2005-09. Measured by the Atlas method, per capita income reached $4,820 in 2009. 
Inequality is moderate when compared to other Former Soviet Union (FSU) countries; economic growth 
has generally been broad-based and pro-poor, lifting all income groups.

17. 
There does not appear to be much geographic disparity in poverty, though poverty is higher 
in rural areas and secondary towns.  Poverty in all of the regions surveyed fell sharply3.  While Baku 
enjoys lower poverty than elsewhere, the gap between the capital and the rest of the country has shrunk.  
Poverty is somewhat more concentrated in rural areas.  About 51 percent of Azerbaijan‘s poor now live in 
rural areas, which account for about 45 percent of the total population.  The poverty incidence in non-
Baku urban areas is also more than twice that of Baku.  A large number of people are concentrated around 
the poverty line, so small changes in income can have a large effect on poverty.      

18. 
The incidence of poverty for IDPs is about the same as that in the general population, 
though IDPs have greater poverty vulnerability and risk.  About 10 percent of the population, up to 
900,000 people, report themselves as IDPs4.  Although some IDPs have integrated into mainstream 
society, most still live in IDP settlements and about 86 percent live in urban or surrounding areas. 
Although they have been IDPs for more than a decade, most lack self-reliant economic opportunities and 
are heavily dependent on state transfers. They report very limited access to water, sanitation, electricity 
and heating.  Interestingly, those IDPs who have their own accommodation outside of government 
provision and/or are living with relatives exhibit an even greater risk of poverty. The overall picture then 
is of more entrenched poverty, with more ―hidden‖ vulnerability than the general population.   

19. 
Azerbaijan has uneven record on social and economic gender issues.  The level of inequality 
between men and women is very small, with virtually the same at Gini coefficient of 31 percent and 30.8 
percent, respectively. This may be partly due to the traditional model of households. While more women 
than men live in widowed or divorced households, such households do not have a larger incidence of 
poverty than the average household.  Laws and regulations do not discriminate on the basis of gender and 
there are no significant gender differences in primary or secondary school enrol lment.  At the same time, 
there are other gender-related issues that affect women including low maternal health care, higher 
unemployment rates, the concentration of female employment in low paid sectors, and low representation 
in the government. Trafficking also remains an issue though smaller than in other CIS countries.   One 
area that needs more analysis and concerted efforts is the high boy-girl ratio at birth.  A new National 

3  The Nahichivan region which is physically separated from the rest of Azerbaijan has not been surveyed.   
4 As in many conflict areas the exact size of the population of IDPs is contested. This figure is based on self 
reporting from the World Bank 2008 LSMS, however official figures put the figure closer to 560,000.

Action Plan on Family and Women‘s issues has been prepared by the Government and is pending 
approval (See Annex 4 for a fuller discussion of gender issues).  

20. 
Progress towards the Millennium Development Goals has been quite good.  As noted, overall 
poverty levels have fallen sharply in light of rising incomes and a more targeted safety net. Access to 
basic education is also good, though the issues of education quality and of access to higher education 
continue to be important challenges.  Health statistics are more mixed and while Government policies and 
data trends are generally moving in the right direction continued attention will be needed if momentum is 
to be maintained. An area of particular concern is the high level of out-of-pocket payments in health. The 
most vulnerable MDG is on environment/water which the Government recognizes as an issue but more 
concerted commitment and faster implementation is needed.  (See Annex 7 for Progress on MDGs) 

E. 

Governance and Anti-Corruption  

21. 
There is wide-spread recognition that Azerbaijan faces an important challenge on 
improving governance and fighting corruption.  Various surveys provide evidence of the seriousness 
of this challenge, while also highlighting those areas of improvement.  WBI governance indicators show 
improvements in regulatory quality and Government effectiveness. At the same time, Azerbaijan 
continues to rank in the bottom quartile as regards control of corruption and voice.  In the 2008 Business 
Enterprise Survey, corruption was identified as the number one issue, with 85 percent of those surveyed 
indicating it as a problem.  The World Economic Forum (WEF)‘s competitiveness index also underlines 
the degree to which corruption stands out as an issue inhibiting business functions. 

Figure 5: WEF Survey - Key Problematic Factors for Doing Business 

22. 
Nevertheless, while corruption remains entrenched, there are some areas that indicate 
progress can be made.  The State Oil Fund (SOFAZ) is a primary example, taking the lead in enabling 
Azerbaijan to become the first validated EITI compliant country in the world in 2009. The Social 
Protection Fund is another example, with its transition from paper based to fully electronic registration 
system sharply reducing the potential for rent seeking on social payments in a record short time period.  
The efforts to streamline business registration and inspections is another positive development, along 
with the creation of five Advocacy and Legal Advice Centers (ALAC) – offices that help citizens to claim 
their rights in cases of corruption – which opened across the country.  The government has entered into an 
open dialogue with civil society through a network of local anti-corruption NGOs and TI Azerbaijan.

23. 
Governance issues will likely play a significant role in whether Azerbaijan can make the 
transformation to a sustainable upper middle income country.  Some areas for improving governance 
in government agencies, State-Owned Enterprises, and the private sector, include the following: 

 Stronger Institutional Capacity.  Azerbaijan increased its public investments at a faster rate than 
it expanded institutional capacity. This has created increased room for state capture and 
suboptimal use of public resources.  Improving institutional capacity in tandem with public 
investments will be critical in improving governance.   

 More Transparent Decision Making.  Greater attention is needed to budget transparency and 
modern fiduciary practices in auditing and procurement , and decision making practices is state 
owned enterprises. Blurred boundaries between public decision making and private business 
reduce the cost-effectiveness of adopted solutions.     

 

Improved Investment climate.  Despite  significant improvement in some areas – as documented 
in the Doing Business ranking - businesses, particularly SMEs, continue to face many non-
competitive practices, particularly in imports and exports.  Attracting new businesses and 
investments in the non-oil sectors is likely to be hampered by formal and informal restrictions 
documented by IFC and others.  

 Skills Enhancement. As documented in World Bank and WEF surveys, improvement of 
governance in public institutions and private and state owned enterprises is also limited by low 
skill levels. Azerbaijan has a lower level of university educated people than other countries in the 
region, and this has resulted in a pervasive shortage of administrative and managerial skills 
necessary for the modern market economy. In addition, employment opportunities too often 
depend on nepotism and patronage, which then in turn often results in sub-optimum decision 
making.   

II. 

Country Development Agenda and Priorities 

A. 

The Country Development Program  

24. 
The Government’s development program can be derived from a mix of sources:  The 
foundation is laid out in the ―State Program on Poverty Reduction and Economic Development 2003-
2005‖ (SPPRED) and the subsequent ―State Program on Poverty Reduction and Sustainable 
Development 2006-15‖ (SPPRSD) which together represent the country‘s Poverty Reduction Support 
Program (PRSP).  Broad development goals include maintaining macroeconomic stability, creating 
enabling conditions to improve income generating opportunities, improving the quality and access to 
basic health and education services, improving infrastructure, and strengthening the social protection 
system to better protect vulnerable groups including IDPs.   Since then, these broad goals have been 
complemented by a number of more specific strategies.  These include the Government‘s ―Regional 
Development Program‖ covering 2009-2012 and supplemented by action programs in a number of 
specific sectors.    

25. More recently, the 2009 financial crisis appears to have heightened the Government’s 
resolve to transform itself into a diversified, globally-integrated competitive economy.  Recent 
Presidential speeches address critical issues such as food security, the business environment, and counter-
cyclical spending.   The High Level Policy Forum organized jointly by the Government and the Bank also 

9 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
provided an opportunity for the Government to set strategic directions in a post-crisis world.  Taken 
together, these sources set out a vision where oil and gas would continue to play a critical role but would 
be complemented with new engines of growth.  The government sees the geographical position as ideal to 
further develop transit-related services.  Developing Azerbaijan as an expanded transportation hub, as a 
center for high value-added food processing industries and other light manufacturing, and even as a 
regional tourist destination, are all part of this vision. Significantly improved performance of the 
agricultural sector is expected to support the food processing sector. The government‘s vision thus 
expects to broaden the country‘s non-oil export markets, now mainly limited to Russia and Turkey, to the 
rest of Europe and Asia.   

26. 
In order to meet this vision, the Government envisages an active role for itself in both public 
infrastructure investments as well as policy and regulatory reforms.  Expanding infrastructure in 
roads, agriculture, water, power supply and gasification is seen as a critical input.  The need to enhance 
the business environment is equally seen as an important goal.  This includes both commercializing SOEs 
even if kept state-owned (for example, the recent decree in converting the railway administration to a 
joint stock company) and building a more market friendly business environment (for example, the April 
2010 Presidential decree on unifying regulations of inspections and registry).  Specific directions include: 

 

Infrastructure.  The Government sees the continuation of priority infrastructure projects as critical 
for development of businesses. The need to ensure uninterrupted power supply and gasification is 
a priority.  Roads are being built which are crucial for development of Azerbaijan as an E-W and 
N-S transport corridor, internal connectivity and development of regions. Irrigation investments  
are necessary for supporting farmers and using water efficiently. Improvement of social 
infrastructure will continue.   The level of tariffs is mixed – for water they have been raised to 87 
percent of cost-recovery but in solid waste tariffs and collection rates remain quite low.  A Tariff 
Council has been created to guide rates and promote further moves towards commercialization. 

 Support to Business.  The Government recognizes the need to help local businesses, and not to 
interfere with their activities. The President has made a strong statement for Government agencies 
to stop unnecessary inspections.  At the same time, the Government would welcome more 
involvement of businesses to support social and regional initiatives more actively. 

 Agriculture.  Agriculture is seen as a priority, particularly in the context of food security but also 
to help increase employment and trade. The State Program for Agriculture (2008-2015) 
recognizes the importance of rehabilitation of irrigation networks; development of food 
processing enterprises; private sector involvement in meat and milk processing; expansion of 
lending resources; and creation of a research center. The Government is also preparing or 
reviewing laws on extension and veterinary services.  

 

Industry and Exports.  The Government is determined to facilitate modernization of its industrial 
base. It expects to help support new industrial facilities in the next 2-3 years that will help create 
jobs.  This will be further strengthened with the help of a new non-oil export development 
strategy.   

 Environment.  The Government‘s Environment State Program 2006-2010 (ESP) committed to 
improve the environment, including investing in a large number of environmental cleanup 
operations given the huge legacy of environmental degradation, land rehabilitation activities and 
protection of environment resources – though implementation has lagged.   

10 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Regional Development. Regional development is focused on strengthening the productive 
potential of the regions in non-oil sectors (such as agriculture and tourism) and improving the 
living conditions to ease the pressure on migration to Baku.  

27. 
Government strategies also point to Azerbaijan’s vision for building its human capacity and 
social services.  The Government views the state as having a central role in providing social services to 
its citizens. The Government is proud of its social programs aimed at reducing poverty by targeted social 
assistance, and by improving infrastructure in education and health. Nevertheless, the Government has 
tended to focus more on building physical infrastructure (schools, hospitals) rather than building 
institutions and improving the quality of professional staff.  On IDPs, the Government has provided 
significant direct financial and housing support, but has also sought to keep them together as a group with 
the expectation of their eventual return.   

 Education.  The Government seeks both to decentralize budgetary spending and decision-making 
to the community level, while ensuring an objective availability of central budgetary resources.  
The Government strategy also includes basic education teacher training and curricula reform.  
While there is an Education State Program 2009-2013, the country lacks a longer term strategy, 
particularly for higher education and innovation 

 Health. The Government has begun a process to rationalize its health care delivery system.  It 
includes developing treatment protocols, training of personnel, and a licensing system for 
physicians. A state program on maternal and child health established a priority on vaccinations 
and better pre-natal care.  A ―Health Electronic Card‖ program is being implemented to better 
coordinate the flow of health information.  A strategy for health financing and insurance is being 
developed but has not yet been adopted. 

 Social Protection.  The Government has implemented a well targeted social protection policy. 
Azerbaijan has also put the creation of increased work opportunities at the core of its labor policy.   

 

IDPs. Until now, assistance to IDPs has been mostly focused on improving elementary living 
conditions (moving the last IDPs from temporary tents was accomplished only last year) and 
securing daily needs by financial and in-kind subsidies. The next step is to provide training and 
opportunity to IDPs for more active participation in the labor market and self-reliance. 

B. 

(i) 

Key Economic and Social Priorities 

Economic Competitiveness 

28. Macroeconomic stability must be the foundation for sustainable growth.  At the moment, the 
overall macro-economic situation is stable, with high growth rates, low debt levels, and an accumulating 
oil fund which should reach about $20 billion by the end of 2010.   However, as noted earlier, Azerbaijan 
is reaching the limit of its oil based GDP growth, though growth from the gas sector may postpone the 
decline for a few years.  Macroeconomic policies that seek to enhance the competitiveness of the 
economy will be necessary.  Maintaining a well run Oil Fund that withstands pressures to transfer 
excessive funding to the budget will also be necessary.  

29. 
An important challenge in macro-stability is to contain Dutch Disease.  Large inflows of 
foreign exchange from natural resource revenues have driven up the real exchange rate which together 
with structural impediments have rendering non-commodity exports less competitive.  To contain this 

11 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
will require a multi-faceted approach. The first prong of a containment strategy would be to manage 
entering of revenues to the domestic economy. Azerbaijan‘s Oil Fund is playing a central role in this, and 
has accumulated about half of Azerbaijan‘s fiscal revenues from oil to date. The second prong of the 
strategy would be to maintain fiscal prudence through clear rules on spending oil revenues and a 
strengthened MTEF.5  The third prong is to maintain a flexible exchange rate and an open trade regime. 
Unfortunately, Azerbaijan‘s cross-border policies have pushed it to a low rank in the Doing Business 
Trade Facilitation Index. The fourth prong would be to accelerate structural reforms and infrastructure to 
improve productivity and allow the private sector to respond easily to market forces. 

30. 
Fiscal prudence is particularly important given Azerbaijan’s oil and gas revenue profile.  
Azerbaijan is likely to see fiscal surpluses in the near term while oil production is on a plateau (i.e. 2010-
2015, chart 2) and maybe a few years subsequently as fiscal revenues from gas materialize.  However, in 
the medium term, fiscal revenues from oil and gas are expected to decline significantly in nominal terms 
and as a percent of non-oil GDP, suggesting that the country may experience a severe fiscal adjustment at 
the end of its oil and gas boom, which could then be mitigated with resources saved in the Oil Fund 
during boom times.  The Bank estimates that Azerbaijan is overspending relative to a ―permanent 
income‖ approach (reflected in the country‘s Long Term Oil Revenue Management Strategy).   
Azerbaijan will continue to have the capacity to support priority infrastructure and social needs; and 
indeed these investments will be important to enhance competitiveness.  But this will need to be 
accomplished in the context of careful investment review and prioritization so as not to exceed prudent 
overall spending limits. 

31. 
There is also room for greater efficiency in the use of public funds. The 2008 Public 
Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) report rated Azerbaijan‘s system quite high in the 
implementation of budgetary expenditures, but found it wanting in the practices surrounding prioritization 
and medium-term investment budgeting. In particular, the expenditure management system needs 
strengthening. The budgetary planning process with a budgeting framework that sets the medium-term 
resources envelopes (ceilings) at the sector and agency levels is still not fully operational.  Azerbaijan‘s 
Treasury Information Management System (TIMS) is still in its roll-out phase and its investment 
appraisal system is still under design.  The PEFA also identified weakness in accounting and auditing 
capacity, particularly in the light of the Governments objective to introduce international financial 
accounting standards.  The 2008 Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) found the public 
procurement system leaves too much room for discretion regarding the use of restrictive procurement 
practices and limitation of bidders.  The CPAR also pointed to the need to improve organizational and 
decision-making processes, strengthen oversight and develop standard documentation. Improved financial 
control and audit systems throughout the government would give greater assurance of efficiency.  Making 
basic budgetary data available to the public would strengthen transparency and accountability.  

32. 
Greater transparency and efficiency in State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) are also needed to 
avoid budgetary drain. Azerbaijan is making some progress in converting SOEs to joint stock 
companies and commercializing them (for example, AzerRail), while raising u tility tariffs to near market 
rates to ensure these companies can run with a minimum of budgetary support.  New legislation provides 
that all new State debt and guarantees, including those through SOEs, must be approved by Parliament 
and disclosed in the budget.  Progress is also underway in shifting SOEs towards the use of international 
accounting principles—and these should also be matched by introducing international auditing practices.  

5 In preparation for the oil boom, the government adopted the principle of ―constant real spending‖ out of oil 
revenues in its Long-term Oil Revenue Management Strategy (LTORMS), but this was not fully implemented.   
From 2005-2008, Azerbaijan increased its budget by about 40 percent per year.  While this increase in budgetary 
spending fueled growth in construction and non-tradeable sectors, it also contributed to reducing the competitiveness 
of tradable goods. Exchange rate appreciation has also had an impact on competitiveness. 

12 

 
 
 
 
                                                 
There also remain considerable inter-SOE debt and non-commercial practices in many SOEs.  In 2009, 
the Government needed to provide emergency liquidity support for SOCAR and other SOEs.  Greater 
efficiency in public spending will also therefore require a focus on SOEs, including the potential to move 
towards privatization if consensus can be reached that this is an appropriate mechanism to enhance 
efficiency. 

33. 
The Azerbaijan financial sector has weathered the global financial crisis to date but 
remains underdeveloped. Non-performing loans (NPLs) rose modestly to 6.1 percent in 2009 from 4.5 
percent in 2008. The Central Bank of Azerbaijan (CBA) has reacted to the crisis by strengthening 
financial reporting and bank supervision, raising the deposit insurance coverage, and implementing a 
three year tax abatement to support capitalization of banks.  Nevertheless, the banking system is 
significantly constrained in its ability to mobilize local deposits and support growth of the non -oil sector. 
Azerbaijan‘s credit to private sector/GDP ratio and deposit to GDP ratio are among the lowest in the 
region (see charts below). 

Figure 6: Financial Sector Activity Level

34. 
A key constraint in balancing  of the banking sector is   a single public-owned bank 
(International Bank of Azerbaijan) which controls 44 percent of banking assets, while at the same time 
fragmentation of other banks (of the 45 other banks, none have a share above 5%).  The overwhelming 
market dominance of IBA coupled with its governance, credit and liquidity pressures pose crucial 
concerns for financial stability as well as competition. Access to credit, particularly by SMEs, is 
constrained.  High interest rates (in the 20-30% range) and collateral requirements also do not favor 
SMEs. More strategically, Azerbaijan should rebalance the banking sector to lower the level of 
concentration and encourage stronger commercial banks. Capacity constraints within the CBA also 
reduce the effectiveness of its supervisory and enforcement abilities.  There is also the need to ensure a 
well working collateral system. 

35. 
Given constraints on banking, developing the non-banking financial markets and capital 
markets increases in importance.  Consistent with most small emerging markets, Azerbaijan‘s financial 
intermediation is virtually all provided through the banking sector; however, it is not well placed to 
support the medium term growth of the non-oil economy. The leasing and insurance markets are still 
relatively small and there is a need to deepen domestic capital markets as well.  Recognizing this, 
development of the securities market is a priority area through, inter alia, strengthening the legal and 
regulatory framework, and improving the capacity of the regulatory body and underlying trading 
architecture.  This will help to stimulate enterprises to tap sources of finance directly from the capital 
markets, and provide investors new opportunities and improve the resiliency of the financial system

(banking, insurance, securities and micro-finance).   Development of the public and private pension funds 
is another area of possible focus. 

36. 
The business environment requires a mix of ―basic and second generation‖ reforms. The 
government recently stepped up its efforts to improve the regulatory environment for business , including 
relaxing the rules for starting small and medium businesses and creating a ―one-stop window‖ for 
registrations.  Azerbaijan‘s ranking improved from 97 th to 38th among 158 countries, between the Doing 
Business 2008 and 2010 surveys. A presidential decree on April 13, 2010 instructed the Cabinet of 
Ministers to prepare recommendations for unified regulations of inspections and inspections registry (at 
the Ministry of Justice).  Azerbaijan‘s progress in three areas—approval of construction licenses, trading 
across borders and, to a lesser degree, payment of taxes—significantly lags other countries. This finding 
confirms views from firms about high transaction costs resulting from informal barriers to business 
operations in respect of licenses, customs clearances and tax inspections. Also, in some cases de facto 
arrangements have lagged legal reforms. Greater access by SMEs to credit (as noted above) is also 
needed.   

37. 
Trade facilitation.  If Azerbaijan is to be a transit hub, its trade and custom facilitation processes 
have to be comparable with the best. Currently it ranks at the very bottom in trading across borders in the 
Doing Business 2010 report. The weaknesses are many: in addition to generally high costs in terms of 
both time and money for imports and exports, there is differential treatment of enterprises in customs 
processing as well as in formal and informal charges. The scope for collusion between some importers 
and customs officials is considerable. This is evident from the fact that similar import consignments 
obtain different duty rates and different regulatory treatment, which distort competition in domestic 
markets for the same imports. Also, the processes for clearing consignments are out -dated. There is no 
use of more modern risk-based inspections, where only a share of consignments would be inspected 
depending upon their risk profile. Azerbaijan undertakes measures to adress obstacles to trade.  A ―one-
stop shop‖ principle for crossing the border has been introduced from January 1, 2009. Veterinary, 
phitosanitary and sanitary control measures, as well as the posts established for issuance of permission 
forms to international cargo vehicles were cancelled. Also, the number of documents and procedures 
necessary during offiialization of foreign trade operations were reduced. Azerbaijan remains one of the 
few countries in the world that has not yet acceded to the WTO.  Accession would help to resist 
protectionist pressures and convey policy reliability to both domestic and external investors. 

38. 
Rural Development The agro-food industries and primary agricultural production are key 
components of Azerbaijan‘s non-oil economy. Although its share of the country‘s total export revenues 
has declined to below 6 percent, the sector is the second-largest exporter after oil and gas with a 
contribution to total value-added in the non-oil sectors around 40%.  Further, it is a key employer of the 
economy, employing close to 40 percent of the total workforce in full-time or seasonal employment. The 
growth potential for the sector is considerable on both the domestic and external markets, in particular in 
fruits, vegetables, and nuts.  There have been improvements including establishment of a system of water 
user associations and improvement in animal health services.  However, to meet its potential and improve 
productivity, the sector faces a number of structural and financial challenges, including: 

 Weaknesses in the legal and regulatory system (quality standards, pest management, etc)  
 Continuing difficulty in buying, selling and consolidating land  
 Poor agricultural and pasture land management practices (landscape degradation) 
 Poor state and maintenance of infrastructure (irrigation and drainage and rural roads) 
 Weak agricultural research and education system 
 Low level of agricultural services (advisory, veterinary, etc.) 
 Poorly developed supply chains (storage, grading, cold chain, distribution, etc.) 

14 

 
 
 
 
 
 Limited access of credit for farmers, and SME modernization and development 
 Poor quality or lack of inputs (including seeds, machinery, information) 
 Greater risk of variability in the weather and of floods and droughts (due to climate change). 

39. 
Azerbaijan has developed a power and gas supply system capable of delivering electricity 
and gas of acceptable quality to almost the entire population. Recent extensive government 
investments in the energy generation, transmission and distribution capacities (supported by the World 
Bank) have resulted in notable improvements in the quality of utility services. Electricity supply has 
improved along the entire grid, supporting economic activity in the process. Notwithstanding these 
positive developments, institutional reforms lag behind the improvements in infrastructure. In addition, 
the energy/gas transmission and distribution networks are still in need of upgrading. Another issue is that 
Azerbaijan has developed significant power generation capacity which exceeds domestic demand; 
however, it has experienced difficulties in selling its energy surplus to regional markets. To address these 
challenges the country needs to modernize utility services further, encourage investments in the 
transmission and distribution networks and help build regional energy markets.  

40. 
Continuing improvement of other infrastructure is a priority, including through a strong 
degree of commercialization. Azerbaijan‘s poor quality of public infrastructure, exacerbated by a weak 
public expenditure framework, has been one of the factors impeding development since the mid-1990s.   

 About 45 percent of the main roads are in poor condition.  About 45 percent of regional roads are 
also in poor shape and about 15 percent are in need of immediate repairs.  This hampers links 
between territorial units in a number of regions.  
 Similar problems plague the rail sector. Due to deteriorating infrastructure, Azerbaijan Railway 
(an important export route for oil) is unable to operate at full capacity.   
 The reliability of public water supply, although it has improved in recent years in the capital area 

and the construction of Oguz-Gabala-Baku water supply pipeline for providing Baku with 
uninterrupted and reliable potable water supply is about to complete, it remains low at 13 

hours per day on average, and in many parts of the country outside Baku, people receive as little 
as three hours of water supply per day.   

41. 
To expedite improvements in network utilities (power, gas, water, fixed-line telecoms), 
Azerbaijan has  sought to fund critical investments from the budget while simultaneously pursuing 
financial viability through increases in tariffs (in some but not all cases to close to cost recovery levels) 
and the introduction of metering and billing systems.  To strengthen institutions, the government is 
gradually moving to corporatization and consideration of private participation.  It will be critical to 
continue and deepen these efforts.  As investments go forward, it will be important to match these with 
improvements in information systems and maintenance practices to ensure the sustainability of 
investment returns.   

42. 
Environment. The troubled state of the environment in Azerbaijan has been well recognized in 
Government and donor development strategies and priorities, and is largely a legacy issue.  The broad 
concerns range from impacts of oil production on the Caspian Sea and coastal lands; discharge of 
untreated contaminated water; solid waste and radioactive waste; and pressures from urban sprawl and 
deterioration of natural resources. Particularly, the Absheron peninsula is a serious concern due to 
pollution accumulated in the course of nearly 150 years of oil production .  Policy, institutional, and 
political economy issues remain key barriers to making progress. Despite the Government program and 
the declaration of 2010 as the year of the environment, much needs to be done.

Building Human Capital 

43. 
Reforms in primary and secondary education reforms need to be continued.  Primary 
enrollment rates are over 90 percent but the quality of basic education needs improvement.  The PISA 
2006 results rank Azerbaijan among the lowest of all 57 participant countries. Azerbaijan did poorly in 
Reading and Science, though interestingly the Mathematics scores are relatively high. The country took 
part in PISA 2009, and the results will be released later this year.  National assessments in grades 4 and 9 
are set to be introduced in 2010 and progress tracked every two years. A pilot new curriculum is under 
development which should help improve learning outcomes and should be rolled out over the next few 
years.  Azerbaijan has been focused on a number of efficiency initiatives, such as increasing the very low 
student-teacher ratio, introducing an external rigorous assessment to measure the educational quality for 
judging the contribution of spending to quality improvement, and raising remuneration levels of teachers 
based on their performance.  

44. 
Radical change is needed in tertiary level education, both on enrollment and quality.  The 
Government faces two critical constraints to further social and economic development:  (i) Azerbaijan has 
among the lowest participation in tertiary education among CIS countries at about 15 percent and (ii) the 
quality of its tertiary education is not producing the skills needed to support a competitive 21 st century 
economy. The number of university applicants has been rising in the past decade; however the number of 
admitted students has been stable at 25,000-30,000 each year. The Government controls the size of 
enrollments, including the number of private university students.  This tight control prevents institutional 
agility, quick development of new institutions and stifles innovation.  Many courses are excessively 
theoretical, outdated, and not responsive to changing labor market needs. Reform will require increased 
merit based access to universities, greater independence of the education institutions , support for the 
private provision of education services, more accountability in education institutions and of professors, 
and stronger relationships with businesses, ensuring that curricula respond directly to market needs.  A 
stronger quality assurance system and improved testing information can provide rigor.  

45. 
Healthcare is being rationalized and rehabilitated. Health service delivery is characterized by 
extensive infrastructure with an emphasis on hospital facilities. New facilities have been built in several 
regions, but the quality of provided services and the level of the health personnel skills need to be 
improved. Access to health facilities and health personnel is almost universal, although most are skewed 
towards urban areas, creating difficult access for rural and remote communities.  New quality standards 
for health facilities and clinical standards and protocols have been recently adopted and the MOH is 
developing mechanisms to introduce testing and certification of health personnel.  Public expenditures on 
health have increased considerably during the last five years (though it remains low as a percent of GDP 
compared with other CIS countries).  At the same time, access to essential medicines remains low (though 
improving), and this has contributed to keeping the level of out-of-pocket health expenditures high (see 
Box 2). Increased opportunities for public/private partnerships in health care provision should be 
considered. 

16 

 
 
 
 
 
46. 
Progress has been good on social assistance.  Currently, the targeted social assistance program 
(TSA) supported by the Bank reaches about 50 percent of the very poor which is good compared to other 
CIS countries.  At the same time, there is room for improvement of targeting mechanisms, updating the 
TSA law and additional training to further increase the coverage of the very poor to over 70 percent. 
Social care services to vulnerable groups (elderly, disabled, single mothers etc) need to be broadened and 
improved despite some 1500 social workers already providing the services.  Moreover, more effective 
programs for providing people with opportunities to enter the labor market are needed.  Professional and 
vocational education centers that offer opportunities to upgrade skills need to be improved through 
strengthened infrastructure and standards in order to better meet labor market requirements. These 
objectives should be pursued within a client centered framework that links employment services with the 
targeted social assistance mechanism. 

Box 2: Out-of-pocket expenditures in Azerbaijan 

The Government of Azerbaijan deserves credit for increasing public expenditures for health seven fold 
from 2002 to 2008.   As a result, Out -Of-Pocket (OOP) health expenses have fallen from 79% to 52%.  
Nevertheless, at 52% OOP payments are still too high.  Recent studies that look at the impact of OOP on 
households indicate that the impoverishing effect of OOP payments in Azerbaijan is very high (World 
Bank, 2007 and 2009).  Evidence indicates that a large share of OOP is spent on pharmaceuticals, which 
often price out the poor.  Further, large OOP expenditures may cause households to delay or forego care 
that would otherwise improve health and welfare, or lead to impoverishment in the event of ill health.  As a 
result, a large share of households in Azerbaijan which fall below the poverty line do so because of high 
OOP health expenditures.  It is estimated that the poverty headcount  increases by about 7 percentage 
points after taking OOP expenses into account. 

These findings suggest that notwithstanding the large increases in health expenditures, there is an 
important policy agenda to reduce OOP expenditures.  OOP expenditures can be improved by either 
prepayment or insurance, as well as by scaling payments more progressively to patients‘ ability to pay.  
This has implications for the design of a basic benefits package, investments in health facilities, ways of 
providing financial protection against high OOP health payments, and the level and targeting of 
government health expenditures. 

47. 
IDPs remain displaced twenty years after the conflict, and their living conditions are far 
below those of the local population. Infrastructure remains poor in IDP settlements.   Most IDPs are 
dependent on the state for support and have limited opportunities for jobs, particularly those in rural 
communities.  Further, governance and social accountability in IDP settlements is weak, with limited 
involvement of community members in their own development. The challenge will be to resettle IDPs 
into more permanent accommodations, provide improved infrastructure services, and involve IDPs in 
developing sustainable livelihoods beyond state support. The 2010 budget allocated substantial 182 
million manats for settlement of refugees and IDPs. 

III. 

The World Bank Group’s Strategy 

A. 

Implementation of the Last CPS 

48. 
The FY07-10 CPS was prepared at the start of the oil boom.  Growth in the years immediately 
preceding the CPS was robust, and even higher growth rates were anticipated with the coming on stream 
of several new oil and gas fields and the BTC pipeline in 2006.  The Government saw this as an 

17 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
opportunity to accelerate development and achieve the Millennium Development Goals as soon as 
possible, particularly given the temporary nature of this income. These ambitious goals were laid out in its 
PRSP.  It viewed the Bank as a reliable partner that could help prioritize increased investments as well as 
ensure that they were carried out with adequate fiduciary oversight.   

49. 
The level of Bank support was ramped up dramatically in tandem with the Government’s 
desire to accelerate development and its increased creditworthiness .  Up to FY05, Azerbaijan was an 
IDA-only country, receiving about $50-75 million per year.  In FY05, Azerbaijan was declared 
creditworthy for IBRD lending, but IBRD lending was limited to two loans in FY05-06.  The total 
amount of lending envisaged in the FY07-10 CPS was increased significantly to about $1.2 billion over 
four years (IDA plus IBRD).  Further, the Government indicated its intention to provide 20-50 percent in 
cofinancing on Bank lending.  Just a year into the FY07-10 CPS, many loans were larger than anticipated 
and the Bank had lent the full amount authorized.  As a result, the Government requested a further 
increase in the lending envelope to support its ambitious development plans, and the amount was ramped 
up to $2.4 billion under the CPS Progress Report.  However, this proved too ambitious and in the end, the 
Bank extended only $1.6 billion during the CPS period. 

50. 
The instruments envisaged were investment and technical assistance operations, as well as 
IFC investment and advisory services.  While there were relatively good results from the Bank‘s 
Development Policy Operations, given the lack of budgetary need, no further policy operation was 
envisaged during the CPS period.  Rather, regular policy dialogue on key reforms was envisaged based on 
analytic work as well as monitoring under the CPIA. The danger of overheating the economy was 
recognized but it was felt that our public expenditure dialogue plus the well functioning Oil Fund 
(established with the help of the Bank) would help to prioritize expenditures and channel excess funds for 
future generations.  Portfolio risk was also recognized but at the time, there were not significant portfolio 
issues and the disbursement ratio was reasonably strong at 20 percent.  

51. 
The focus of the CPS was quite broad, covering four pillars:  (i) improving public sector 
governance (including public expenditures, accounting, the business environment and the judiciary), (ii) 
supporting growth of the non-oil economy (including  access to financial services, SME support, rural 
infrastructure , transport, energy and water infrastructure), (iii) increasing the quality of and access to 
social services (including health care, education, social assistance, and improving the living conditions of 
IDPs) and (iv) improving environmental management (including cleaning up legacy pollution, supporting 
biodiversity and natural resource management, and disaster management).  Governance was a cross -
cutting theme. 

Results 

52. 
Overall country-level results during the CPS period were mixed.  As noted, growth rates were 
in the 20-30 percent range and poverty levels fell dramatically, from close to 50 percent to about 16 
percent in 2008.  Non-oil growth was also very high, though much of this is indirectly linked to oil 
production. Progress has also continued to be made towards most of the Millennium Development Goals 
(MDGs – See Annex 7).  However, progress on overall policy reform and institutional deepening was 
more mixed. The CPS set out to monitor this through the CPIA ratings, but only about half of the targets 
on these were met.  The greatest progress was against the overall macro-economic framework, meeting 
social needs, and improving rural and community infrastructure services.  Health care and basic education 
services have improved and the social assistance program is increasingly well targeted.  Reform progress 
was weakest in the areas of public expenditures, transparency and governance, and the environment.  
Overall, the perception of corruption in Azerbaijan continues to remain high.  Though it should be noted 
that Azerbaijan has made the important achievement of becoming the first EITI compliant country.   

18 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
53. 
The design of the CPS as regards the specific activities and goals it supported proved to be 
overly ambitious.  The CPS as originally designed was consistent with the Government‘s strategy and 
built on the substantial results achieved in the previous CAS period, including a reasonably well 
performing portfolio and steady progress by the Government on structural reforms.  However, it proved 
overly ambitious in two key ways:  First, the Bank knew from experience elsewhere that reform progress 
often slows in situations of rapid income growth.  Without a development policy operation or a clear 
replacement to anchor policy reforms, the policy dialogue was unable to make significant progress during 
the CPS period in several key areas such as public expenditures and certain elements of the business 
environment.  Second, the ramp up of lending overwhelmed implementation capacity.  Some projects 
were brought to the Board without meeting readiness conditions and implementation was protracted.  The 
Bank took corrective action on both accounts during the second half of the CPS, including by (i) holding 
a High Level Policy Forum to help galvanize decision makers on key reforms needed , (ii) conducting a 
Joint Portfolio Review which brought high level attention to problem projects and established a Working 
Group representing key Ministries to maintain and elevate such attention, and (iii) slowing new lending 
and placing greater attention to readiness at entry.    

54. 
As a result, achievements as measured against CPS results targets were measured as 
moderately unsatisfactory according to the CPS Completion Report .  The best results came from 
smaller operations in community development, where lending to rural and IDP communities have 
continued to help improve people‘s lives.  Good results were also achieved in the social protection areas, 
and to a lesser extent in health and education where reforms and improved infrastructure have been slow 
but steady.  Progress has also been achieved in rural development, including irrigation, avian influenza 
control and agriculture credit. More mixed results were seen in the larger infrastructure projects – 
Highways, Water, and Rail – where implementation has been delayed but are on track to deliver results 
largely during the coming CPS period. The poorest results were seen in the public expenditure, 
governance and environmental areas where little progress has been made. The area of environment is 
particularly disappointing given the importance of making progress in cleaning up legacy issues in the 
Absheron Peninsula.  In light of the difficulty in getting agreement with the Government on the way 
forward, two of the three loans in this regard were withdrawn in FY10 before becoming effective.  

55. 
IFC was relatively more successful than the Bank, committing $133 million in 20 projects 
from FY07 to date. IFC saw steady growth in its investment portfolio reflecting strong economic growth, 
and increased human resources dedicated to Azerbaijan through its special initiative for Central Asia and 
Azerbaijan.  Notably, all of this investment was outside of the oil and gas sectors supporting the non -oil 
economy, mainly through financial intermediaries, primarily banks.  This represented a significant shift 
for IFC.  In the prior five years (FY02-06) approved investments outside the oil and gas sector were $5 
million or less per year.  IFC‘s outstanding portfolio currently totals $102 million with 59% of this in 
financial institutions, 22% in the oil and gas sector, and 19% in the real sectors (primarily retail).  This 
growing portfolio is generally performing well even through the crisis, although the level of risk in some 
of its bank exposures has increased, and one of its investments has started experiencing problems in 2010. 
IFC also increased advisory activities in investment climate, access to finance, and corporate governance, 
with some successful legislative and regulatory interventions, improvements made to individual FIs and 
real sector clients, and public awareness initiatives.    

Key Lessons and Recommendations 

56. 
Based on the CPSCR, the following key lessons can be learned from the implementation of the 
FY07-10 CPS:    

 

Increase the focus on 
implementation. The Bank should 
increase 
its attention 
to 
implementation of existing operations, and focus primarily on achieving results under existing 

19 

 
 
 
 
 
 
operations. Where implementation is substantially stalled, the Bank and the Government should 
consider cancelling operations in order to better focus on those operations where success can be 
achieved more quickly.  

 Be more selective in new operations. The Bank should try to narrow the focus of its activities, 
based on Government commitment and Bank experience. This will mean deepening project 
engagement in those areas where success has been achieved, and focusing on those areas of 
development priority, strong Government demand, and clear Bank comparative advantage. At the 
same time, the Bank should not shy away from playing an advocacy role in other areas where 
there is a high development need and Bank comparative advantage, but limited Government 
ownership.    

 Apply a stronger readiness filter for new operations.   In the previous CPS, a number of 
projects were brought to the Board where procurement and institutional arrangements were not 
fully developed.  As a consequence, these operations were unable to disburse for 18 months and 
two had to be withdrawn.  This wastes precious time, budget and focus. For the new CPS, project 
implementation arrangements should be more fully advanced before taking loans to the Board.   

 Rebalance Bank activities towards more concrete mechanisms for knowledge sharing and 
policy dialogue. It may be useful to consider more concrete mechanisms for carrying the policy 
dialogue forward, including increased use of analytic work to underpin new lending and 
potentially some policy-based lending.  The high level policy forum in 2009 yielded promising 
results and may also provide a mechanism to enhance dialogue. 

57. 
In addition, a FY10 Bank internal review echoed some of these lessons on implementation 
for the Bank’s program  in Azerbaijan:  (i) Do not underestimate risks--The sharp increase in lending 
did not adequately recognize the risks in low absorptive capacity and non-transparent decision-making, 
(ii) Ensure readiness for disbursement--While cutting preparation times, many projects did not have fully 
developed procurement and policy agreements.  Inadequate preparation and lack of ownership have led to 
slow disbursements, (iii) Strengthen portfolio monitoring-- The Bank should provide increased support to 
country efforts at portfolio monitoring and coordination, and (iv) Focus management attention early on 
project issues –Bank management should be persistent in including implementation issues in its dialogue: 
in the absence of results on specific projects, restructuring and cancellation should be pursued.   

B. 

The New Country Partnership Strategy for FY11-14 

58. 
The design of the CPS reflects the key challenges facing Azerbaijan in the medium term.   It 
is tightly focused on achieving results in two key pillars: (i) building a competitive non-oil sector and (ii) 
strengthening human and social services.  These two pillars constitute independent developmental 
objectives but, at the same time, they are mutually re-enforcing.  Further, a key lesson from the last CPS 
is that public investments grew faster than institutional capacity could improve thus resulting in 
opportunities for rent seeking and slowing implementation. Therefore, a cross-cutting filter for all 
activities will be improving governance and institution-building, without which it will be difficult to 
achieve sustainable results.  

59. 
How the strategy will be implemented is just as important as the focus areas .  The previous 
CPS also focused on priority areas for Azerbaijan, but did not achieve adequate traction.  In light of this 
experience, the new CPS will focus in the first instance on implementation of the large existing Bank 
portfolio, including faster disbursements but also restructuring and closing projects when needed. New 
operations will be calibrated against existing operational progress.  Because of this, most of the Bank‘s 
results objectives will be based on existing operations.  Second, more attention will be paid to building 

20 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
analytic knowledge and strategies in particular sectors in order to ensure that there is an agreed approach 
before launching operations.  Third, a more structured approach towards policy dialogue will be sought 
through several vehicles – a regular high level forum focusing key policy makers on developing a shared 
reform agenda, a potential joint economic research program between the Government and the World 
Bank, continued close cooperation between the Bank and IFC on policy advice to the Government related 
to the private and financial sectors, and exploring a possible development policy operation to help support 
reform implementation. 

60. 
IFC and the Bank will play complementary roles whereby IFC‘s advisory and financial 
services for private sector‘s benefit will reinforce the Bank‘s lending and AAA in the public sector.  IFC 
will support the private sector to address CPS objectives, namely (1) building a competitive economy 
through greater access to finance and an improved business climate, (2) strengthening human and social 
capital through possible support to private sector participation in addressing issues such as provision of 
health care services, infrastructure, and possibly energy efficiency, and (3) improved governance and 
institution-building through the promotion of transparent business practices and capacity building for 
financial institutions and agencies key to private sector development. 

Strategic Objective 1:  Building a Competitive Non-Oil Economy 

Results area 1:  Enhancing macro-economic stability and growth policies 

 Outcome 1: Prudent macroeconomic and fiscal management 
 Outcome 2: Improved trade policy and institutions 
 Outcome 3: Sustained improvements in business environment 
 Outcome 4: More transparency and efficiency in public institutions 

61. 
Prudent macroeconomic and fiscal management.  In light of the leveling off of oil and gas 
revenues, the key element of macroeconomic management will be to help Azerbaijan keep its expenditure 
levels in line with sustainable income expectations.  This will also provide an incentive to prioritize 
public investments, contain inflation, and avoid crowding out the private sector.  The key indicator will 
therefore be the reduction in non-oil deficit as a percent of non-oil GDP. The goal by the end of the CPS 
period will be to reduce that.6  The primary instrument will be the programmatic public expenditure 
review, which will focus on improving the use of medium term planning (MTEF) and sustainable 
recurrent cost financing.  This would be combined with other instruments to make our overall policy 
dialogue more concrete (regular high level policy forums, exploring the potential for a DPO series as well 
as a Joint Economic Research Program – JERP – and possibly IFC advisory services to increase the ease 
of paying taxes.  These efforts would help, inter alia, by building more effective inter-agency coordination 
on macro-policy. The Bank‘s Treasury Department will continue to provide support to the Oil Fund on 
asset management.  Close coordination with the IMF will be essential. 

62. 
Improved trade policy and institutions.  All studies and practice point to currently restrictive 
and non-transparent trade policies and institutions as a primary road block to achieving private sector led 
non-oil growth.  Key indicators of success will be growth in the volume of non-oil exports and reduction 
in time and cost to export and import. An overall measure of progress would be an improvement in the 

6 Fiscal sustainability analysis presented in the Country Economic Memorandum for Azerbaijan ( 2009) indicates 
that if Azerbaijan wants to maintain fiscal sustainability, the non -oil deficit should be reduced to about 30 percent of 
non-oil GDP by the end of the CPS period (2014). At present, the absence of a fiscal rule and of an effective 
Medium Term Expenditure Framework makes the achievement of this result uncertain.

ease of Border Crossing in Doing Business (2009 Doing Business ranked Azerbaijan 177 out of 183 
countries on ease of trading across borders).  At the heart of making this happen is a non-oil export 
strategy by the Government now under preparation.  The Bank will provide analytic support on the export 
strategy to ensure it focuses on central policy and institutional issues, and is endorsed with a time bound 
action plan and success markers. The Bank will also provide longer term analytic assistance on WTO to 
help the Government move forward on WTO accession which will spur increased and open trade. Several 
of the possible new instruments for policy dialogue (Policy Forum, JERP, and possibly a DPO) may also 
be utilized to support this outcome.  If requested by the Government, IFC could provide complementary 
advisory services to improve the ease of trading across borders .  Close coordination with the EU on 
reforms to enhance trade integration will be pursued. 

63. 
Sustained improvements in the business environment.   While Azerbaijan has made progress, 
there are quite a few areas where further significant improvement is possible to increase the ease of doing 
business and access to finance.  The overall benefit of these improvements will be measured through 
various surveys (BEEPS, Doing Business, IFC SME survey etc).  More specifically, in addition to 
improvements in tax and customs (see above), the following targets will be supported and monitored: (i) a 
significant reduction in land registration processing time, (ii) increase in the use of mortgages to finance 
investments, (iii) development of the domestic capital markets, and (iv) the number of micro and SME 
loans made through IFC-supported banks, and (iv) further progress in streamlining permits and 
inspections. The Bank will support these efforts through the ongoing Real Estate Registration Project, 
and the proposed new Capital Markets Modernization Project. The latter will be particularly important in 
promoting corporate transparency and providing new avenues for financing enterprises and supporting 
non-oil growth, given the weaknesses in the banking sector. The Bank will also maintain a regular 
technical assessment and policy dialogue with the CBA and other financial sector institutions, funded in 
part through the FIRST initiative.  Several of the possible new instruments for policy dialogue (Policy 
Forum, JERP, and possibly a DPO) may also be utilized to support this outcome.  The CAPSAP project 
will address weak financial reporting practices and underdeveloped audit profession to strengthen the 
business environment for SMEs.  IFC will continue to provide financing to SMEs, in particular through 
financial institutions. It will also continue to provide investment climate advisory work to reduce 
regulatory burden on businesses, corporate governance advisory services, and financial infrastructure 
advisory services (credit information sharing and secured lending).  SECO will remain a key IFC and 
Bank partner in this area.   

64. More transparency and efficiency in public institutions.  Greater transparency and efficiency 
in public institutions will reduce the opportunities for rent seeking, enable the Government to operate 
effectively within a tighter fiscal budget, and strengthen market based approaches.  Key goals during the 
CPS period will be (i) greater utilization of the MTEF in budget formulation and the provision of a budget 
summary to the public, (ii) an increase in the number of public investment projects prepared on the basis 
of rate of return criteria, (iii) an increase in the number of SOEs and agencies using international financial 
standards, (iv) and an increase in user satisfaction of the courts, (v) more effective use of public 
procurement, and (vi) strengthen the capacity of the Chamber of Accounts to conduct ISA based audits. 
The Bank will support these goals directly through the ongoing Public Investment Capacity Building 
Project, Judicial Project, and Corporate and Public Sector Accountability Project and indirectly through 
other projects working through SOEs. Analytic work on budget transparency will be supported through 
the annual Public Expenditure Review, follow-up to the Country Procurement Assessment Report, and 
analytic work on helping the Government develop a market based SOE strategy.  IFC, through its 
Investment Climate Advisory activities will help to improve the private sector awareness of regulatory 
processes and increase transparency through an updated SME survey and capacity building with the 
Government on surveys related to government services, for example a tax client survey currently being 
launched.  A new ROSC may be considered in the outer years to measure progress in the area of 
Accounting and Audit development.

Results area 2: Upgrading Key Growth Supporting Infrastructure 

 Outcome 1: Transport time and vehicle operating costs reduced  
 Outcome 2: Improved agriculture and irrigation services 

65. 
Transport time and vehicle operating costs reduced.  Improved transportation is a central part 
of Azerbaijan‘s effort for non-oil growth since it will help to (i) strengthen inter-country linkages, (ii) 
provide greater export market access to local producers and (iii) build Azerbaijan‘s role as a regional 
East-West and North-South transit corridor.  The overall goal is to upgrade highway and so reduce road 
user cost on the sections supported by Bank operations.  For Railways, the goal is to purchase new 
locomotives and rehabilitate rail track so as to reduce the East-West transit time.  With Bank support, the 
Government would seek to increase the volume of rail transit traffic (from 11 million tons to 23 million 
tons) and improve locomotive reliability.  Bank supported activities include the ongoing Highways 2 and 
3 and Railway Projects, combined with a regional Transport Sustainability Review, a Transport Sector 
Review, and an IDF grant for transport quality enhancement.  Dependent on implementation progress 
under Highways 2 and 3, an additional new Highways 4 project and a regional life-line roads project 
could be considered.  IFC is looking into possible investments in private logistics companies and/or 
investment support to private participation in transport infrastructure.   A key partner will be the ADB 
which is also providing significant transport investment to Azerbaijan. 

66. 
Improved agriculture and irrigation services.  Agriculture in Azerbaijan, with its myriad of 
micro-climates and close access to both Europe and Asia, holds great economic potential.  Rural areas are 
also where most of the poor live and providing greater incomes in rural areas would help stem migration 
towards already crowded urban areas. The goal would be to continue to increase productivity and income 
levels of participating farmers under Bank projects.  Irrigation services would also be strengthened (the 
volume of irrigation water would be increased from two irrigations to four irrigations per season).  Water 
User Associations would continue to be expanded and strengthened.   The Bank would support these 
efforts through its ongoing Agriculture Development and Credit Project (ADCP) 2, a follow up ADCP3, 
and a new Irrigation Project (Irrigation II).  The Bank would support these projects with increase analytic 
work – an Agriculture and Irrigation Sector Update, and continuing analytic work on related trade issues 
– quality standards and WTO access.  IFC would consider direct financing of agribusiness or related 
sectors (e.g. retail, packaging, logistics), as well as indirect support through financial institutions, and may 
also consider launching advisory services that contribute to improved competitiveness of the sector, for 
example in areas such as food safety standards and/or agrifinance.   

Strategic Objective 2:  Strengthening Social and Municipal Services 

Results Area 3: Improving Social Services  

 Outcome 1: Strengthened social protection and employment services 
 Outcome 2: Wider access to health services  
 Outcome 3:  Improved quality of basic and higher education 
 Outcome 4: Improved living conditions for IDPs 
 Outcome 5: Improved road safety 

23 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
67. 
Strengthened social protection and employment services.    The Government has already made 
major progress in establishing a user-friendly targeted social protection system.  At the same time, further 
improvements are needed in the social protection system, particularly to ensure that the coverage of social 
assistance for the very poor.  In addition, the matching process between those seeking employment and 
businesses in need of staff is not functioning well.  It would be helpful to ensure that the employment 
services be able to reach and serve a larger number of job seekers . If more job seekers can be helped, this 
will both help to focus social assistance on those that need it most, and facilitate business growth.  The 
main mechanism the Bank has for pursuing this is the ongoing Social Protection Project. This will also 
be complemented by analytic support through the Programmatic Poverty Assessment.   

68. Wider access to health services.  Key health indicators have improved but more progress is 
needed if the MDG targets are to be met, particularly to address the growth of drug resistant TB.  In order 
to do so, the Government is currently expanding and upgrading health facilities and improving health care 
organization and delivery of services with Bank support.   The Bank is also supporting the Government in 
building an effective health strategy which would among other things help to make the sector more 
efficient and effective.   However, the Government needs to continue to increase public health spending to 
reduce out of pocket expenses for the population, particularly to ensure a sustainable supply of essential 
medicines.  Key goals would be the further improvement in health indicators in supported regions and the 
adaptation of an effective health strategy that would start to reduce out of pocket expenses.   The main 
mechanism the Bank has to support these activities is the ongoing Health Sector Reform Project.  
Depending on market developments, IFC will also consider possible investments in private health care 
services.  

69. 
Improved quality of basic and higher education.  Popular access to basic education is not the 
issue.  Rather there is a need to improve the quality and cost effectiveness of basic education.  The 
Government has launched with Bank support reform in the basic education system, including curricula 
reform and streamlining the number of schools.  In turn the success of these efforts would be measured 
against improvements in basic educational outcomes. As regards higher education, there is significant 
room for improvement both in the percent of population who go on to tertiary education and the quality of 
tertiary education. Ultimately, Azerbaijan needs a highly skilled workforce if it is to be competitive 
internationally.  These reforms are therefore important not just for social reasons but to improve 
Azerbaijan‘s overall competitiveness. The Bank will support efforts in basic education through its 
ongoing Education APL2. The Bank will complement this with an Education Strategy, covering both 
basic and higher education.  If agreement can be reached on an effective higher education strategy, the 
Bank will provide financing for a Higher Education Project in support of this.       

70. 
Improved living conditions for IDPs.  Up to 900,000 or so IDPs (10 percent of the population) 
remain relatively poorly integrated into society and rely heavily on Government assistance.  This is a 
large source of human capital that is not being effectively utilized.  The need is to both improve the living 
conditions of the IDPs while strengthening their ability to generate their own livelihoods.  Success in this 
area would be measured through the number of micro-projects that meet IDP community needs and if the 
number of IDPs generating self-reliant income can be increased.  The main mechanisms for this are the 
ongoing IDP project and a proposed follow-on IDP II Project. The Bank would also support analytic 
work on IDPs during the CPS period to further determine how best to provide services and integrate them 
into society.  Issues would also be tracked and analyzed in the programmatic poverty assessment. 

71. 
Improved road safety.  Azerbaijan has a high level of road traffic injuries and fatal ities even by 
ECA standards.  As Azerbaijan improves its road network, added efforts are needed to strengthen road 
safety systems, enforce existing laws and regulations and educate the population to prevent risky road 
behavior and protect pedestrians.  The goal is to help Azerbaijan effectively implement a Traffic Safety 
Strategy and reduce road injuries.  To this end, the Bank is providing support under the Highway 2 

24 

 
 
 
 
 
project to implement this strategy on the entire road network and to decrease the fatalities rate on the 
portion of the network being rehabilitated.  

Results area 4: Improved municipal and rural services  

 Outcome 1:  More reliable water supply and sanitation 
 Outcome 2:  Improved reliability of solid waste management services  
 Outcome 3:  Improved access to rural infrastructure 

72. More reliable water supply and sanitation.  The Government has established the provision of 
reliable water and sanitation as a priority for the country.  The World Bank, the ADB, KfW, JBIC and the 
Government itself are all supporting this priority.  For the World Bank supported operations, the goal is to 
increase the number of people with improved water supply and sanitation.  A second target would be 
improving reliability in water supply in the serviced population.  The primary vehicle for achieving these 
results will be the ongoing National Water Supply Projects 1 and 2.   Depending on implementation 
performance of these projects, the Bank could consider a follow up project.   If there is potential and 
government support for private sector participation, IFC would consider extending advisory services or 
investment support, though at the moment no agreement on this exists.    

73. 
Improved reliability of waste management services.  Azerbaijan faces the need for a major 
upgrading of its disposal management for both waste water and solid waste.  For solid waste, the goal 
would be to extend waste collection services for the currently un-served population of Greater Baku. This 
would include the rehabilitation of the largest informal waste dump in Baku.  For waste water, the 
Government is upgrading several water treatment plants and has requested Bank assistance to put into 
place a mechanism to dispose of this water (after treatment) in an environmentally sound manner.  On 
solid waste management, the primary vehicle for Bank support would be the ongoing Solid Waste 
Management Project.   On waste water, a new project is under preparation - the Hovsan Wastewater 
Outfall Project. Follow-on projects could be considered for both activities, dependent on implementation 
performance.  The Bank will invest in analytic work to ensure policy coherence in solid waste and waste 
water management. 

74. 
Improved access to rural infrastructure.  Comprehensive efforts to support rural communities 
by identifying and supporting the highest priorities are proven cost-effective methods of supporting local 
infrastructure.   While there are many improvements to be made, one key area is rural roads and it is 
anticipated that the number of people with improved access to rural roads would increase significantly 
Rehabilitation of small scale irrigation works is estimated to increase production . Schools‘ rehabilitation 
to increase school enrollment in affected remote mountainous communities.  Rural infrastructure projects 
also have  a high impact in employment generation. The primary vehicle for achieving these outcomes 
will be the ongoing Azerbaijan Rural Investment Project (AzRIP) and follow-on additional financing for 
this.    

75. 
Improved environmental and energy planning.  Environmental needs loom large in 
Azerbaijan.  While the importance of addressing these issues is widely recognized, there is not yet an 
agreed approach and methodological base for decision making.  This CPS addresses this gap through 
investment in analytic work on prioritizing environmental investments.  Analytic work on climate change 
would also be carried out built on the initial environmental cooperation with SOCAR currently underway, 

25 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and would help inform Bank projects such as irrigation. The Bank would also support the environmental 
agenda through its water and waste management projects as well as environmental impact assessments 
under several infrastructure projects. Closely linked to the environmental agenda is the energy agenda.  
The Bank has just completed support for a power transmission project which is improving efficiency in 
energy use, and we are also working with SOCAR on gas flaring and utilization options. The Government 
also took steps towards improving the financial viability and governance in the sector, through increased 
tariffs and in the case of Azerenerji moving to IFRS for its financial statements.  Energy trade and energy 
efficiency continue to be important areas and the Bank will remain open to exploring ways to advance 
this agenda during the CPS period.  IFC could consider possible advisory and/or investment in financing 
for energy efficiency improvements building on its experience in other ECA markets and the energy 
efficiency survey it completed in Azerbaijan in 2009. 

Cross-Cutting Filter:  Strengthening Governance and Institutions 

76. Within each of the proposed interventions the Bank will aim to help the Government 
strengthen key policies and institutions.  Azerbaijan cannot achieve sustainable growth or cost-effective 
service delivery without investing more in improving governance and institutions.  Success would be 
measured against progress in four dimensions, where there are related activities and results targets in each 
of the main areas of focus. 

 Project Implementation Capacity: The simplest dimension is the use of internationally 
accepted practices for accounting, procurement, and environmental assessments. The Government 
looks to the Bank to ensure that public funds are used in an efficient and effective manner. The 
Bank will continue to strengthen procurement practices throughout the Government through 
follow up on the recently prepared Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR).  Beyond 
this, the Bank has a wealth of experience in helping the Government to ensure projects have 
strong Monitoring and Evaluation systems and are adequately staffed to design and review 
quality standards.   Project implementation will also be supported by closer supervision, greater 
attention to capacity building, increased analytic work, and feedback channels from stakeholders. 
Decentralized procurement staff will help with risky projects and capacity building in the PIUs  
from the Country Office, and  on-site technical supervision of the projects implementation will be 
further strengthened. The Bank will provide more procurement and financial management 
training for the PIUs and the government. 

 

Institutional Capacity Building:  Building capacity beyond project activities within individual 
agencies will be an essential element in achieving results.  Helping to strengthen the newly 
established Waste Management Company, the newly commercialized Azerbaijan Rail Company, 
the Roads Department, and various Ministries (health, education, labor, justice) rests at the heart 
of Bank supported projects.  This can be accomplished through building the legal and regulatory 
framework, budgeting and accounting systems, information systems, adequate staffing, training, 
and study tours.  The Public Sector Capacity Building Project and the CAPSAP project provide 
cross-cutting support for institutional capacity.  Capacity building will also be embedded in the 
Bank‘s sector analytic work that will underpin new investments.  IFC would provide capacity 
support for financial institutions and key Government ministries through its advisory work in the 
areas of access to finance and investment climate.  

 Policy reforms to reduce corruption: Within each of the Bank‘s activities, we will be looking to 
identify and support policies or processes that reduce opportunities for corruption.  This includes 
technical solutions such as providing ATM cards for recipients to withdraw social assistance 

26 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
directly without going through a middle man (see Box 3) or introducing methodology of the 
community based decision  making and supervision of  small public investments under the 
AZRIP project.. The Judicial Modernization Project and the Social Protection Project provide 
solutions for  merit based hiring of judges and appropriate remuneration for public employees. 
Analytical work within individual sectors to provide a framework for new operations would be 
particularly important. Bank and IFC analytical work will help the Government identify ways to 
reduce corruption in cross-border activity and the high level policy forum provides a mechanism 
to focus on critical policy reforms needed.  Much of IFC‘s work in investment climate is designed 
to increase the transparency of administrative procedures and requirements, which decreases 
opportunities for rent-seeking; with Doing Business Report having an important role in securing 
high level political support for change.  

 Promoting transparency and public debate:  The Bank‘s efforts to build transparency through 
the Real Estate Registration Project, the Judicial Modernization Project, the CAPSAP project, and 
the proposed Capital Markets Project, along with the PER in strengthening the use of the MTEF 
and the policy forum would all promote this objective.  However, the progress on improving 
governance will require strengthened demand for governance and not just the supply, and will 
require more systematic cooperation with other donors, the civil society, and business 
organizations. Within most Bank projects, the Bank will seek to promote public awareness, 
strengthen transparency, and build in mechanisms for consultations with stakeholders. 
Government publications on activities, policies and achievements would be supported.  Success 
would be measured through improvement of user satisfaction through periodic surveys. Some 
examples of this would be an annual survey of railway users, a survey of irrigation water users in 
supported areas, a survey of the satisfaction of farmers with locally available seeds, and surveys 
of IDPs and rural communities on their satisfaction with supported micro-projects.  IFC would 
complement these efforts through surveys of the private sector, including an update to the SME 
survey and survey work together with the Government related to tax services and other topics to 
be selected in the future.  Public dissemination and discussion of these surveys would be built 
into the Bank Group‘s efforts. 

Box 3: Improving Governance in Social Assistance 

Targeted Social Assistance was introduced in Azerbaijan in 2006.  Since then, Bank projects have assisted 
the Government in fully automating pension and social assistance systems . The new MIS gathers all 
information in one place to facilitate accurate planning and transparency.  In the past, Pension Fund 
employees went door to door, collecting money which may or may not have been transferred.   Now there is a 
formula based system that automatically collects funds.  Second, the distribution of pensions and social 
assistance is also automatic through bank transfers.  Now, 97% of pensioners have a visa card which they use 
to withdraw their pensions from ATMs – providing flexibility in terms of time and location, and reducing the 
opportunity for corruption.   Third, the penetration of the economy has also increased.  More and more people 
are opening accounts to receive social assistance as well. 

A next step towards increased transparency and reduction in fraud is to consolidate the process.  Once people 
are registered as employees, self-employed or business owners, they are to be registered  both for social 
contribution and tax purposes .  Trust in the system has been built by both internal controls and a successful 
PR campaign which included Public Service Announcements on TV, leaflets and posters in every region. 

By the end of 2010, online services will be introduced to further improve transparency.  A calculator will be 
available on an official website where people can work out their pension allowance without the aid of 
consultants.  As time progresses, accounts will be accessible online so that pensioners can monitor their 
account activity themselves.   As a result of these efforts, the State Social Protection Fund (SSPF) was 
awarded the winner of the European Competition of the International Social Security Association (ISSA) for 
Efficient Governance in 2010.   

27 

 
 
 
 
 
77. 
Progress on these fronts will takes time and is a medium term challenge. Nevertheless, over 
time the proposed governance filter is expected to lead to improvements at all three levels - - project, 
sectoral, and national.

Bank Group Instruments 

IV. 

Implementing the Strategy 

78. 
For the full CPS period the Government has requested a total IDA/IBRD lending envelope 
of about $1 billion.  Actual funding would be backloaded based on the principle of starting out modestly 
and deciding lending volumes based on performance.   Over FY11-12, lending is anticipated to amount to 
about $300 million in IBRD, plus about $80 million in IDA in FY11.7  FY11 is the last year of IDA, after 
which Azerbaijan will become IBRD-only.   Funding levels in FY13-14 could be of similar amounts (or 
larger), depending on Government demand and performance, and IBRD's lending capacity.  The lending 
level and program for the last two years of the CPS will be confirmed at the time of the CPS Progress 
Report. It is also anticipated that these funds will be leveraged with Government co-financing in the 20 to 
40 percent range.  In addition to new lending, the CPS period is expected to see accelerated disbursements 
under existing projects.  

79. 
The focus of IDA/IBRD during the CPS will be on faster implementation of ongoing 
projects.  While the ongoing portfolio is an important part of most country strategies, in Azerbaijan this 
is of heightened importance given the large IDA/IBRD portfolio of outstanding disbursements ($1.8 
billion) compared to new lending and the slow rate of disbursements (10 percent in FY10).  The Bank 
will also more aggressively restructure or cancel slow or poorly performing projects.  New overall lending 
will be carefully calibrated to the disbursement and implementation status of ongoing lending. The 
Bank‘s management and senior Government officials agreed to focus on speeding up implementation of 
ongoing projects.  Because of this, new lending only for the first two years of the CPS – FY11-12 - has 
been identified (see Table 2 below), and the results matrix relies primarily on ongoing loans.  The CPS 
Progress Report will provide more clarity on lending in the outer years and will update the results matrix 
accordingly.

80. 
New IDA/IBRD loans will be primarily investment loans, but some potential for other 
instruments will be explored.  All loans during the last CPS were investment loans and it is anticipated 
that this will remain largely the case during this CPS period with two possible exceptions.  First, the Bank 
will explore the potential for new ―Outcome Based‖ instruments in selected areas where adequate 
fiduciary controls can be assured.  Second, the Bank and the Government will consider whether the 
possibility of a development policy instrument would be helpful to support the implementation of an 
economic diversification and export promotion strategy.  If the Bank and the Government decide to 
pursue this option, it would need to be well grounded in an appropriate macro-economic framework.  

81. 
The Bank will increase its focus on analytic work.  One of the lessons of the last CPS was that 
projects were not sufficiently grounded in strategies that had widespread buy-in within the Government, 
and consequently were subject to change which slowed implementation.  The current CPS will re-balance 
the activities of the Bank towards more analytic work as a consequence, particularly in areas where the 
Bank is actively lending (ongoing and new).  Greater attention to analytic work should also help ground 
our policy dialogue more.  Building links with projects should also help to strengthen the impact of 
analytic work, as will innovative approaches (see below).  

82. 
The Bank will also explore innovative approaches to analytic work.  Greater attention will be 
put on building training and technical assistance into analytic work, particularly through the 
programmatic public expenditure and poverty assessment activities.  Greater attention will also be put on 
wider dissemination and discussion of findings to the broader public and civil society as a me chanism to 
build societal consensus and momentum.   Further, the Bank launched an innovative approach to analytic 
work in 2009 – through a High Level Policy Forum in which key policy makers were brought together 
along with Bank senior management and outside experts to focus on developing agreed policies and 
strategies.  The Government expressed appreciation for this approach and asked the Bank to continue it 
over the CPS period.  Finally, the Bank and the Government agreed in principal and are in the process of 
designing  a Joint Economic Research Program (JERP) which would pair Bank and Azerbaijani resources 
to conduct economic analysis and prepare sectoral strategies, with additional emphasis on building lasting 
local research capacity.  The Bank will also look for opportunities to strengthen dialogue with the 
Government and key stakeholders on ways to improve capacity building, including greater participation 
in WBI regional and global programs particularly in areas such as procurement, urban development, 
health and public/private partnerships. 

83. 
Trust Funds are limited and used to support Bank operations.   There are 12 active Trust 
Funds in Azerbaijan with a total undisbursed amount of $9 million.  Most of this ($5 million) comprise 
PHRD grants for ongoing or proposed project preparation and implementation.  The remainder are grants 
focused on complementing specific ongoing projects for IDPs ($1 million), community development ($2 
million), roads ($0.5 million), and water resources and one supporting our analytic work in environmental 
prioritization.  The Bank is also slated to finalize a trust fund agreement with SECO as part of the FIRST 
initiative to support the proposed Capital Markets project and financial sector literacy. 

84. 
IFC expects to increase significantly its investment program in Azerbaijan during the CPS 
period. Based on its track record in implementing projects in Azerbaijan and the slowly improving 
business environment, IFC will seek to increase its investment program from $132 million during the last 
CPS period to around $200 million over the new CPS period.  Financing during the last CPS was heavily 
concentrated in the banking sector.  During this CPS period, IFC will continue to support the financial 
sector but also look more actively for investment opportunities in the real sector and in infrastructure.  
This will be complemented by continued advisory services through its advisory services to improve the 
investment climate, increase access to finance and strengthen financial infrastructure, and to support 
improved corporate governance practices.  Additional opportunities to address CPS objectives through 
IFC Advisory Services may be explored if there is demand, including possibly agribusiness related, 

29 

 
 
 
 
 
energy efficiency finance, and private participation in infrastructure.  Close coordination between the 
Bank and IFC on both lending and analytic work will support effective implementation (See Annex 8 for 
a fuller description of Bank/IFC Collaboration).  MIGA also remains open for cooperation though at the 
moment there is no expressed need for sovereign and/or private borrowing guarantees. 

Box 4: High Level Policy Forum – October 2009 

In 2009, the Government and the Bank decided to jointly fund and create a mechanism to create greater 
consensus around the key issue facing Azerbaijan – the need to build competitiveness.   

Organization.  The Forum gathered together a small group of key economic policymakers in Azerbaijan  
together with a select group of international policymakers and academics. The High Level Forum was 
chaired by the Bank‘s Managing Director and the Azerbaijan Prime Minister.   

Analytical Input.  The Forum used as a background paper a Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) 
prepared by the Bank on the challenges of competitiveness.   It reviewed the building blocks on improving 
infrastructure and the business environment that the Government had put into place, and the next steps 
needed particularly on establishing an effective export strategy, ensuring sustainability in public spending, 
improving trade facilitation, and improving skills in the labor force. This was complemented by the 
successful experiences of Ireland and Slovakia both of which overcame similar economic challenges.   

Conclusions.  Is export-led and FDI-led diversification the right message for a small economy like 
Azerbaijan?  The answer at the forum was a resounding ―yes‖.  Participants concluded that, like all sma ll 
economies, Azerbaijan needs foreign trade to draw knowledge, spur innovation, and expand markets.  
Crucial work is now under way on both an export development strategy and a non -oil economic strategy.   

85. 
Throughout the Bank and IFC’s program, the regional dimension will be considered 
prominently.  Azerbaijan‘s ability to grow its non-oil economy depends significantly on strengthening its 
role as a transit economy, which in turn rests on ensuring that the trade and energy routes supported 
within Azerbaijan link with those supported within neighboring countries and in particular, Georgia, 
Russia, Turkey, Iran and Kazakhstan.  To this end, the Bank sponsors an annual transport donor 
coordination meeting for the South Caucasus, covering all key modes of transport: railways, roads, 
maritime and aviation.  Donors have confirmed the value they see in this cross-country effort and have 
expressed hope that the Bank will continue leading this effort.  Looking eastward, the Bank, along with 
other multilateral institutions, is supporting trade, transport and energy coordination through the Central 
Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) program8.  The Bank Group will also seek to build 
synergy and learning within the South Caucasus across a wide range of other areas such as poverty and 
inequality, health policies, and trade.  At the same time, frozen conflicts and other regional barriers mean 
that such approaches are often best pursued through coordinated national activities rather than purely 
regional programs.     

8  The eight member states of CAREC are Azerbaijan, Afghanistan, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, 
Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Mongolia

86. 
Total Bank lending to Azerbaijan since independence (IDA and IBRD, disbursed and 
undisbursed) amounts to the equivalent of about $2.4 billion, of which about $650 million has been 
disbursed and about $1.8 billion is undisbursed.  The active portfolio consists of 12 IDA credits, and 
seven IBRD loans for a total commitment of about $2 billion. 

87. 
The quality of the portfolio has deteriorated over the last two years mainly as a result of the 
substantial increase of the lending program in FY08, which swamped implementation capacity. The 
disbursement ratio of the portfolio -- a key indicator of overall portfolio performance -- was 6.5 percent in 
FY09, well below the Bank benchmark of 20 percent. The disbursement rate has improved a bit during 
this fiscal year and at end-FY10 stood at 10 percent. The major reasons for the low disbursement were 
change in the structure of the portfolio by significant increase of the lending volume toward new projects, 
combined with delayed effectiveness of the largest projects approved in FY08, and inadequate capacity of 
implementing agencies. There are currently three projects in unsatisfactory condition – First and Second 
Water Supply Projects, and CAPSAP. 

88. 
Remedial action is underway and disbursements are rising.  The Joint Portfolio Performance 
Review (JPPR) conducted in September 2009 identified major challenges and obstacles faced during 
portfolio implementation and outlined a set of actions directed to portfolio quality improvement. A 19 
member joint working group has been established representing all key ministries for the purpose of 
addressing issues and accelerating implementation.   As a follow- up on the JPPR Action Plan approved 
by the Government, the Second National Water Supply and Sanitation project was restructured with a 
change of implementation agency.  The Railway project was also res tructured and has now been signed 
and declared effective.  Two long delayed environment projects were withdrawn after the Government 

31 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
could not reach the consensus needed to authorize project signing and an unsatisfactory project was 
closed.  Action is moving forward on other projects as well.  The Judicial Project is now performing 
satisfactorily and is expected to be restructured within the next few months. The Real Estate Project is 
also making progress after some delay.  CAPSAP and Water Supply I and II have suffered delays and 
institutional issues and concerted attention is being provided by the Bank and the Government to bring 
them up to satisfactory status.  

89. 
Decentralization will also support the new focus on implementation . Improvement in project 
implementation is also expected to be supported by the decentralization of the Country Director, 
increased fiduciary staff, and three Country Sector Coordinators (CSCs) to the field during FY10-11.  The 
Bank has also started a program of providing technical assistance to the Government to help it enhance its 
own implementation monitoring capacity.  

90. 
Fiduciary controls in the portfolio require close monitoring. Financial management and 
procurement arrangements in most implementing agencies are adequate but cont inue to require attention, 
training and strengthening. Efforts will be taken to involve project financial management and 
procurement staff in improving processes, which should help increase disbursements. Currently, projects 
funded by the Bank make limited use of country systems given weakness in country fiduciary approaches.  
Under the CAPSAP project the Bank intends to strengthen accounting and financial management capacity 
of line ministries. In addition, the Public Investment Capacity Building Project w ill provide public 
institutions with a wide range of trainings, including FM and disbursement related courses to strengthen 
their institutional capacity.  These efforts, while modest, should help build the foundation for considering 
phasing in some use of country systems in the future.   

91. 
IFC has a committed portfolio of $127 million, of which $97 million is outstanding. The 
portfolio includes 10 clients, mostly in the banking sector. Portfolio performance has been mostly 
satisfactory, but the global financial crisis and weakening consumer demand has had a significant 
negative impact on one client.  Staff continues to manage the portfolio closely.   

C. 

Results Based Monitoring and Evaluation 

92. 
The Bank will strengthen its results based monitoring and evaluation (M&E) to better 
assess how Bank activities are contributing to results on the ground. The CPS Completion Report 
indicates that not all projects have been regularly monitoring results based indicators, which in turn has 
led to difficulties in assessment and in making mid-course corrections.  During the CPS, the Bank would 
work with the Government to strengthen country monitoring and assessment systems through various 
mechanisms (Capacity Building Project, CAPSAP, CPAR follow up etc), recognizing however that this is 
a long term agenda, likely beyond the horizon of this CPS.  This CPS is results-based with outcomes and 
monitorable indicators, and lending levels will depend on continuing to meet disbursement and results 
targets.  The Bank will support this through: 

(i)   

Greater analytic work prior to investments so that results indicators are well integrated into 
strategy; 

(ii)          Increased attention to results in project design; 

(iii) 

Strengthening project supervision, including providing more resources and management 
attention for risky or problem projects; 

(iv) More attention to better physical verification of works; 

32 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(v)          Improvements in the Governments and Ministries own ability to monitor and verify quality 
of works.  This means greater investment in client M&E systems both at the project level and 
at the overall country level; 

(vi) 

Annual JPPRs based on results monitoring linked to key results indicated in this CPS.  And 
ensure that the results matrix is maintained as a ―live‖ data base; 

(vii) Use of evidence-based surveys and indexes, including benchmarking from international 
surveys (BEEPS, Doing Business, WEF), and performance ratings (CPAR, PEFA); 

(viii) 

Improved multimedia efforts to raise awareness about results through stories of successful 
impact. 

93. 
The Bank will also explore the potential for results based lending during the CPS.  The 
potential for such a new instrument would depend on the Bank‘s ability to ensure that the Bank‘s 
fiduciary responsibilities could be assured in the sector, as well as the sector ‘s ability to generate 
objective and professional results indicators.  Progress on country systems, country-wide or within certain 
sectors, would be an important element in determining how and where to explore this.  The Bank will also 
hold annual high level discussions with Azeri policy makers on the pace of reforms necessary to advance 
the goals of the CPS.  The progress on the policy dialogue will be used to recalibrate the analytical and 
policy work in the coming year.  

D. 

Communications Strategy 

94. 
Enhanced participation and transparency have been used effectively within some 
operations to gain support and improve effectiveness.  The Azerbaijan Rural Investment Project 
encourages community development and, through that, greater public participation in decision making.   
Other operations such as the Judicial Modernization Project, Real Estate Registration Project, and Social 
Assistance Project, have made effective use of information technology to empower people.  And the 
Government has recognized the power of greater communications in a number of areas including rolling 
out the Targeted Social Assistance System and using the communications component of the Avian 
Influenza Project to reach out to the rural areas and disseminate information critical for preventing the 
virus from spreading.  Public education is a key component in IFC‘s advisory work on the investment 
climate, corporate governance and access to finance. 

95. 
Nevertheless, the difficulties with the previous CPS underline the importance of building 
broad support for reforms more systematically across Bank projects.   Building on the good practices 
and lessons of previous years, the new CPS will require that operations support broader outreach, public 
participation and feedback.  This is particularly true for new operations in the social sector, where  public 
understanding of  reforms needs strengthening as part of a readiness filter. The Bank will strengthen its 
communications strategy and country office staffing to also assist the Government in communicating 
policy reforms as well.   

E. 

Gender 

96. 
The CPS considers gender issues as integral part of the whole program.  Gender-related 
issues include maternal health levels, higher unemployment rates for women, the concentration of 
female employment in low paid sectors, and low representation in politics. Trafficking and high 
boy-girl ratios are also issues.   Many of the operations supported by the Bank - particularly in health, 
education and social protection – will have an important impact on women‘s lives.  Further, the 
community and rural level activities will also provide important support.  The CPS will continue to 
monitor activities supported by the Bank to ensure adequate attention to gender issues, including through 

33 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
its programmatic Poverty Assessments and support to IDPs. Bank supported activities will build on the 
gender analysis by the UN and its agencies, and work closely with them and the State Committee for 
Family, Women and Children in furthering progress on gender issues.  The Bank will also remain 
engaged with the civil society organizations dealing with women issues, including through its small grant 
facilities (see Annex 4 for a fuller discussion of gender issues).  

F. 

Partnerships  

97. 
Donor aid for Azerbaijan has substantially declined because of its increased revenues.  In 
2007-08, the Bank was the major aid donor to Azerbaijan, followed on the bilateral side by U.S., Turkey, 
Germany and France, and on the multilateral side by the ADB and EC.  As a major development partner, 
the Bank has consistently aligned its strategy and individual operations with other donors by way of broad 
or individual consultations, and participation in coordination meetings.  In a number of areas – 
particularly highways, water supply and wastewater management – the Bank is actively engaged with 
other donors to ensure consistency in approach.  The new CPS will build on the existing partnerships and 
intensify relations to further achieve the country‘s development goals.  

98. 
The Government plays a leading role in donor coordination.   Donor activity has been 
coordinated through the Department for Coordination of State Guaranteed Credits, Technical Assistance 
and Grants at the Cabinet of Ministers.  In addition, since 2007 alignment of programs is also carried out 
at the Ministry of Economic Development through regular donor coordination meeting usually convened 
once a year. Finally, donors have been coordinating between themselves based on sector interests and 
through EU hosted coordination meetings on particular topics, to which Government participation is 
normally invited (See Annex 6 for a description of donor coordination in key sectors). Since 2007, 
coordination of donor activities is carried out by the Department for Foreign Investments and Assistance 
Coordination of the Ministry of Economic Development.  

99. 
Beyond partner resources, the relationship of Azerbaijan to the EU continues to be 
important in the context of aligning its approaches with Europe through the Eastern Partnership 
program. The CPS process overlaps with the formulation of the EC‘s new Indicative Programme for 
2011-2013 which will focus on development of democratic structures and good governance, socio -
economic reform and sustainable development, trade and investment and regulatory approximation, 
energy security and justice.  

100. Cooperation between the Bank and the EU covers a wide range of modalities including 
policy coordination, and joint or complementary activities in investment operations.  In the transport 
sector, Bank funded operations developing the country‘s highway and railroad network are part of the  
EU supported TRACECA framework.  The Logistical Center in Alyat funded by the EC complements the 
Rail, Trade and Transport Facilitation Project. The Bank is an implementing agency for the EU funded  
Forest Law Enforcement and Governance  program which covers six countries (Azerbaijan, Armenia, 
Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus and Georgia) plus Russia.  In the social sector, the EU Twining Project on 
Enhancing Effectiveness and Efficiency of Social Protection Policy contributes to  the Bank‘s work 
within the Social Protection Development  Project.  The EU and the Bank are also actively coordinating 
activities on modernization of the justice system in Azerbaijan, including strengthening the rule of law 
and human rights protection.  While much of the coordination occurs at the country level, a ―South 
Caucasus Day‖ was organized in Brussels in May 2010 to discuss Bank-EU coordination in the regional 
context. 

34 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
V. 

Managing Risks 

101. The key risk facing Azerbaijan over the next few years is the political economy challenge 
involved in building a competitive economy.  Decision making within Azerbaijan is fragmented, and 
while there is a general support of reform at the highest levels of the government, there are also many 
vested interests.   The forward movement has been rather cautious and not always linear.  To mitigate the 
risk of reforms being deterred and/or delayed, the Bank will seek stronger positioning in its policy 
dialogue, through innovative approaches such as the High Level Forum, a Joint Economic Research 
Program, and possibly a DPO.  The Bank will also invest greater effort into preparing the ground for 
reforms through more country and sector analytic work, disseminated broadly within society, before 
providing investments in particular areas. Where feasible, the Bank will also seek to take into 
consideration the political economy in its analytical and investment activities.  This risk has important 
implications for IFC, as investment opportunities are currently constrained by poor transparency and 
financial disclosure, and the success of the investment climate advisory services depends on the political 
will to undertake changes to the regulatory and policy regime. 

102. The second key risk factor is continued weakness in governance and institutional capacity. 
Weakness of institutions was the major obstacle to implementation of the previous CPS.  Broader 
governance and corruption challenges erode the efficiency of public expenditures as well as portfolio 
implementation.  And despite improvements in the private sector environment, there continue to be vested 
interests and a lack of transparency in the private sector that can hold the non-oil economy back and IFC 
from providing support.  The Bank Group recognizes the complex environment and has elevated 
governance and institution building to a cross-cutting theme that needs to be taken into consideration in 
every activity the Bank undertakes.  Each task (analytic and lending) will include efforts to intensify 
training in skills needed for professional management and improved transparency and financial soundness 
within supported institutions.  The Bank will also use the recently completed Country Procurement 
Assessment Review (CPAR) as a guide to strengthening procurement practices.   

103. A third risk is portfolio implementation.  Some Bank investments within the previous CPS 
have been seriously delayed or are underperforming.  The Bank will seek to mitigate this risk with the 
following actions: (i) The focus of the CPS will be first on implementing current projects, which will 
undergo regular review and a high level joint working group has been set up by the Government to review 
poorly performing projects – without corrective action or restructuring in a reasonable time frame, poorly 
performing operations will be cancelled; (ii) In considering new projects, the Bank will put special 
emphasis on implementation performance of ongoing projects within the sector and re-emphasize the 
need for projects to have   fully developed technical and procurement plans, and safeguards – they must 
be ready to allow implementation immediately after the Board approval; (iii) Senior management within 
the Bank and the Government will continue recently renewed  efforts to pay close attention to these issues 
in a more systematic way. 

104. 
Fourth, global economic impact will also need to be carefully monitored.  After many years 
of double digit growth led by increasing oil and gas exports, future growth in Azerbaijan is expected to 
fall to more modest levels and be increasingly dependent on progress on making the non-oil economy 
more competitive.  Economic strains may develop if oil and gas prices further decline due to the 
prolonged global economic weakness.  Azerbaijan has successfully built an impressive Oil Fund, which 
will have accumulated over $20 billion by the end of 2010.  This provides an important cushion of 
resources, although only as a last resort, for unexpected fiscal pressures.  Other exogenous risks such as 
climate change and natural disasters will also need to be carefully analyzed and monitored. 

105. 
Finally, there is a regional security risk. The conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh continues to 
fester, notwithstanding numerous high level meetings between the Governments of Armenia and 

35 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Azerbaijan, and the international community through the Minsk Group being also engaged in mediation 
efforts.  Should this currently frozen conflict enter into a period of greater armed conflict, this would 
affect development outcomes.  On the other hand, should there be at least a partial  resolution, the Bank 
would stand ready to re-orient and augment its support towards the major levels of reconstruction,  
resettlement and reintegration that would be needed.  As noted, the Bank will also look for opportunities 
to strengthen regional knowledge sharing and integration where there is interest.

CPS OBJECTIVE 1:  BUILDING A COMPETITIVE NON-OIL  

ECONOMY 

Key Government Goals: 
 Prudent macro-economic management and improved trade policies and institutions  
 Strengthen Azerbaijan‘s role as a regional transport corridor and improve connectivity within Azerbaijan 
(to be measured by increased transit traffic) 

 

 

Improve the business environment for higher non -oil growth (to be measured by the level of growth of 
SMEs, non-oil exports).  

 Build a more efficient and productive rural sector. (to be measured by increase in agriculture exports, 
farm income) 

Key Issues and Obstacles: 

 Macro-economic management will require careful balancing of expenditure, exchange rate , and inflation 
in light oil revenues.  

 Trade policies and institutions need to relax the current ―control oriented‖ approach. 

 Transport: Roads need improvement and widening.  Port and Rail need modernization, intermodal / 
interoperability.  

 Business environment needs strengthening in several areas (tax, customs, licensing etc)  

 The financial system remains shallow. The largest bank is state-owned and SMEs have limited credit 
access  

 Agriculture – need to improve agriculture productivity, food certification and processing, irrigation 
framework, crop and livestock disease risk

Annex 2: CPS Completion Report:  FY07-10 

AZERBAIJAN COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY COMPLETION REPORT 
FY07 – FY10 

1. 
This Country Partnership Strategy Completion Report (CPSCR) evaluates Bank Group 
Assistance to Azerbaijan for FY07-FY10.  The CPS (report number 37812 – AZ) was discussed by the 
Board in December 2006.  A CPS progress report (report number 43935-AZ) was discussed by the Board 
in May of 2008 on an accelerated schedule in view of the Government‘s request to the Bank to increase 
lending.  The progress report assessed progress in implementing the CPS, reviewed the Government‘s 
request, and indicated where revisions in the program were needed to accommodate the increased lending 
program.   This Completion report examines the relevance of the CPS to Azerbaijan‘s longer -term goals, 
the achievement of CPS outcomes, and the World Bank Group‘s performance in furthering the CPS 
outcomes.  The report draws on project appraisal, supervision and completion reports and evaluations by 
QAG, IEG and ECSPS.  Other sources include the Government‘s own assessments, IMF program 
documents, various national and international studies and surveys, as well as inputs from Government 
officials, other stakeholders in Azerbaijan and the Bank country team (both former and current members).   

Background 

I. 

Relevance of the CPS 

2. 
Development of the oil and gas sector since independence provided Azerbaijan the opportunity to 
combat poverty and develop into a sustainable middle-income economy.  The post-independence oil 
boom drove per capita income to $1,240 in 2005 up from $470 in 1995.  Growth in the years immediately 
preceding the CPS was robust, in double digits both for the oil and non-oil sectors of the economy. The 
years covered by the CPS would see a further dramatic increase in oil and gas revenues that the 
Government hoped to tap to reach its long-term objectives of reducing poverty and achieving the 
Millennium Development Goals.   The oil and gas reserves available to Azerbaijan are limited compared 
to other oil economies and it was expected at the time that they would begin to decline as early as 2011, 
hence the Government gave high priority to using oil revenues to eliminate poverty and set Azerbaijan on 
a sustainable development path. 

3. 
The CPS identified six challenges that faced Azerbaijan in achieving these objectives.  First was 
maintaining macro-economic stability in face of the oil boom.  Managing the relatively short -lived and 
volatile revenue streams in a way that maintained macro-economic stability while developing a 
sustainable and diverse market based-economy would prove to be an ongoing challenge for the 
Government throughout the CPS period.  The second challenge was maintaining progress in reducing 
poverty.  Good progress had been achieved in reducing poverty in the preceding period as overall poverty 
was reduced from 45 percent in 2002 to 24 percent in 2005, largely due to income growth and better 
targeted social assistance. The third challenge was to improve social conditions and continue progress on 
the millennium development goals.  Here the focus was on improved education, where ou tcomes were 
poor, and on improving health care, where fundamental system-wide reforms were needed.   

4. 
The fourth challenge was improving governance at all levels.  Some progress was achieved prior 
to the CPS on increasing the transparency of oil revenue management through Azerbaijan‘s participation 
in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), but other challenges loomed in developing a 
framework for a sustainable fiscal policy, improving financial discipline, reducing conflicts of interest, 
and fighting pervasive corruption.  A fifth challenge was developing the Non-oil sector of the economy. 
The Government recognized that this was key to the long-term sustainability of the economy, given 
relatively limited oil and gas reserves.  The CPS identified growth potential in other areas including non-

45 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
oil minerals, agro-processing, supplies for the oil and gas industry, and transit trade.  To foster 
development in these areas the Government recognized the need to rehabilitate infrastructure, particula rly 
for transport, energy and water, strengthen the financial sector, and improve the business environment.  A 
final challenge was the need to clean up after decades of environmental mismanagement, particularly in 
the Absheron Peninsula where years of oil production had contaminated 33,000 ha. of land. 

The Government Strategy 

5. 
 The Government‘s strategy for the CPS period built on its earlier successes with its PRSP – the 
State Program for Poverty Reduction and Economic Development (SPPRED).  The strategy focused on 
ensuring economic growth while maintaining macroeconomic stability and stimulating improved income 
generation, particularly in the non-oil sector and in regions outside Baku. A related priority was on 
rehabilitating and expanding public infrastructure.  The strategy also focused on the social sector, namely 
on providing better quality and improved access in health and education, strengthening social protection 
systems, particularly for children, and improving living conditions for refugees and internally displaced 
persons (IDPs).  Finally the strategy gave priority to improving public administration and governance and 
ensuring that all Government policies and programs promoted and protected gender equality and 
respected the principle of environmental sustainability. 

The 2007-2010 CPS Design and Identified Risks 

6. 
The CPS aimed at helping Azerbaijan harness increasing oil revenues to establish a well-
diversified and sustainable economy.  It also focused on integrating rural areas and secondary cities into 
the economy, securing equitable basic service standards in electricity, gas and water supply, and 
improving access to markets in the country and beyond.  Moreover, it focused on social services and 
human development, and on the environment and natural resource management. The CPS had four pillars: 
(I) Improving the quality and transparency in public sector governance; (II) Supporting sustainable and 
balanced growth of the non-oil economy; (III) Increasing the quality of and access to social services; and 
(IV) Improving environmental management.   The CPS also made the continued fight against corruption a 
crosscutting theme.   

7. 
For improved governance, interventions focused on a stable macro-economic environment that 
made prudent use of oil revenues; improved public expenditure planning and management; strengthened 
financial management and public procurement; sound public and corporate governance, accounting and 
audit; an administrative and regulatory regime conducive to private sector growth; and a strengthened 
justice system.  For sustainable and balanced growth of the non-oil economy, the CPS aimed to support 
expanded access to financial services; development of SME‘s and direct investment in the private sector; 
investment in rural infrastructure and services; improvement in the road and rail network; rehabilitation 
and expansion of the water supply and sanitation network; increased reliability in oil and gas supplies; 
and strengthened financial viability in the utility sector.  The third pillar focused on improved health care 
coverage; a more competitive education system; better targeted social assistance and a more sustainable 
pension system; and improved living conditions for internally displaced people (IDPs).  The fourth pillar 
on the environment aimed at cleaning up legacy pollution; reducing carbon emissions; supporting 
sustainable resource management; and strengthening natural disaster management.    

8. 
Instruments.  Early in discussions with the Government, it was agreed that the CPS would have 
no DPLs and that lending would be based on investment operations.  The PRSC, which had been 
approved by the board in FY2005, supported the Government‘s comprehensive structural reform program 
but given increased oil revenues, general budget support was no longer needed and the planned second 
and third PRSCs were canceled.  It was agreed that the CPS would continue supporting the ongoing 
structural reforms through a mix of projects, analytical work and TA and that progress in the reforms 

46 

 
 
 
 
 
 
would be monitored throughout the CPS period.  IFC would also support the CPS agenda through an 
expanded program of advisory services and increased financing for the non-oil sectors of the economy.  
In FY2006, Azerbaijan began a rapid transition to IBRD lending and the move to IBRD was accelerated 
in the FY07 – FY10 CPS.  The initial design for the CPS was for just over $300 million per year for a 
total planned lending program of $1.260 billion, including both IBRD loans and IDA Credits.  

Identified Risks 

9. 
The CPS identified seven risks and the CPS Progress report highlighted five of identified risks as 
most important.  First was macroeconomic management, which was of concern because of the potential 
for mismanagement of oil revenues to slow implementation of the reform programs. The CPS indicated 
that the Bank‘s and the Fund‘s continued policy dialogue and advisory services on macroeconomic issues 
would help ensure macroeconomic stability and fiscal sustainability. Second was the risk of delays and 
waning consensus in implementing key elements of the reform program.  The CPS noted that Azerbaijan 
still had a substantial reform agenda ahead of it and that progress in the past had often been slow and non-
linear.  It proposed that the Bank would support active outreach centered on the country‘s PRSP, and 
would undertake regular reviews of progress with respect to the core CPS reforms and monitoring 
indicators based on the CPIA. The third risk was related to Governance, namely state capture and 
corruption both of which were perceived to be persistent problems.  To mitigate this risk it was stated that 
the CPS, through its AAA and projects, embodied a comprehensive governance action plan of improved 
accountability and disclosure through strengthening institutions performing checks and balances. For 
example, the EITI and the Corporate and Public Sector Accounting Project (CAPSAP) would help 
improve financial accountability of key enterprises.  Fourth, the CPS progress report noted that regional 
security issues always presented a risk but indicated that the security situation had stabilized in the region 
and that mediation efforts by the international community in Nagorno-Karabakh were ongoing. The fifth 
risk was implementation capacity risk, which was of particular concern because of the sign ificant scaling 
up of lending that took place in 2008.  The progress report noted that the Bank would be working with 
several new agencies for the first time and even existing implementing agencies would face strains as the 
program expanded.  The progress report indicated that the Bank would work with the Government to 
build a strong cadre of project management staff and embed capacity building into individual projects. 

The CPS Progress Report 

10. 
In 2007, the Government asked the Bank to accelerate and increase the volume of the lending 
program as it viewed the years covered by the CPS as an opportunity to direct its increasing oil wealth to 
meet significant infrastructure deficits and social needs.  The expanded lending was to be achieved both 
through additional financing and the development of new projects within the framework of the original 
four pillars.  The expanded lending program was discussed with the executive directors at the time of the 
CPS progress report (May 2008).  The progress report presented a revised results matrix that reflected the 
new operations and attempted to better quantify expected results.   

11. 
As a result of the acceleration and increased loan sizes, the entire CPS lending program had been 
exceeded by the end of FY08 ($1.521 billion) and the revisions agreed during the CPS progress report 
laid out a lending program for the remaining two years (FY09, FY10) of an additional $1.2 billion, more 
than doubling the lending volumes originally proposed for the CPS period.  

12. 
IFC also expanded its presence in the non-oil economy over the period of the CPS.  Overall it 
committed $132 million in 20 projects from FY07 to FY10.  Notably, all of this investment was outside 
of the oil and gas sectors representing a significant shift for IFC.  In the prior five years (FY02-06) 
investments outside the oil and gas sector were $5 million or less per year.  As of June 2010, IFC‘s 
outstanding portfolio totaled $102 million with 59% in financial institutions, 22% in BTC, and 19% in the 

47 

 
 
 
 
 
 
real sector (primarily retail).  IFC also increased advisory activities in investment climate, access to 
finance, and corporate governance and these activities are still ongoing.  Advisory activities around the 
BTC project to increase local procurement by British Petroleum and improve access to finance for these 
suppliers were concluded during the CPS period in December 2008. 

Overall Assessment of CPS Relevance.  

13. 
This CPSCR rates the CPS design and the identification of risks as moderately unsatisfactory.  
The CPS as originally designed was fully consistent with the Government‘s strategy and built on the 
substantial results achieved in the previous CAS period which included delivery of all planned operations 
and analytical work, a reasonably well performing portfolio, disbursement rates at the ECA average, and 
good progress by the Government on structural reforms.  The projects and areas of focus for analytical 
work were all well-chosen and reflected areas where the Bank had a clear competitive advantage.  The 
areas of structural reform were also well chosen.  The CPS covered a period of rapid expansion in oil 
revenues, and the Bank knew from experience elsewhere that the progress in structural reforms often 
slowed in such situations.  As a result the Bank had modest expectations and chose areas of reform where 
it felt Government commitment remained strong.  However, the decision not to continue with the PRSC 
series left the Bank without an adequate tool to anchor the policy dialogue and the measures proposed in 
the CPS to help sustain the policy dialogue and improve implementation capacity proved to be inadequate 
despite considerable resources available in the Bank budget to carry out the dialogue.  

14. 
The risks identified in the CPS progress report were well chosen and the mitigation measures 
discussed seemed reasonable at the time.  Problems emerged, however, as a result of the decision to 
accelerate and increase the size of the lending program in FY2008.  The new operations outlined in the 
progress report were consistent with the CPS objectives but the risks associated with the expansion of the 
program were underestimated and mitigating measures inadequate.  Delays and poor implementation both 
combined to overwhelm the program after FY2008.  Delays in project signing and effectiveness affected 
nearly every project approved in FY2008 and in some cases stretched longer than 18 months.  Two 
projects approved in FY08 were in fact withdrawn after long delays in signing.  

15. 
Due to the lack of progress in getting implementation started for the projects approved in FY08, 
management in FY09 decided to delay preparation of most of the projects identified in the progress report 
for FY09-FY10.  At the end of the CPS only two additional projects and an additional financing were 
approved, totaling $429 million.  Overall, $1.8 billion for 13 projects were approved in the CPS period, 
about 30 percent more than in the original CPS but around $900 million less than proposed at the time of 
the progress report.   

II. 

Results Assessment 

16. 
The first two years of CPS implementation (FY2007-FY2008) were characterized by the 
Government‘s desire to push forward with a large public investment program to rehabilitate and expand 
crucial public infrastructure, namely in transport, water and power.  The Government was aided by the 
growing availability of oil revenues that enabled large increases in recurrent spending, mostly for 
improved public wages and social benefits, and capital improvements.  In parallel the Bank oversaw a 
large increase in its portfolio in FY08 over and above what was stipulated in the CPS in order to 
complement the Government‘s own accelerated program. At the same time the portfolio of Bank financed 
projects carried over from the previous CAS were by-in-large performing well, particularly the projects in 
the rural, transport and social sectors and IFC moved strongly to support non -oil economic growth by 
diversifying out of lending to the oil sector.   

48 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
17. 
The last two years of the CPS were marked by delays in the getting projects approved in FY08 
signed and effective and implementation underway.  The big push in lending in FY08 strained already 
weak implementation capacity and revealed weaknesses and a lack of transparency in the Government‘s 
decision making and consensus building apparatus.   In response to the problems that emerged in 2008 
the Government and the Bank delayed most new lending until the start-up problems could be adequately 
addressed.  Efforts to address the portfolio problems were instituted in 2009.  They included increasing 
sector and procurement staff presence in the country office and a high-level Joint Project Implementation 
Review in September 2009 that concluded with a decision by Government to establish a working group 
that would meet routinely with the Bank to address project implementation problems.  Bank management 
also decided to withdraw two of the three environment projects approved in FY2008 after Government 
could not reach a consensus on authorizing project signing and to close another poor performing rural 
environment project.  Finally, the Bank carried out an internal assessment of quality of supervision 
reporting and a region wide review of low disbursement rates in which Azerbaijan was one of the core 
countries reviewed.  Follow-up on the recommendations in both assessments is underway.  IFC was able 
to keep its momentum on investments in the private, non-oil economy with more projects in FY09 than in 
each of the previous two years. (FY07: $31 million in 8 projects, FY08: $28 million in 8 projects, FY09: 
$47 million in 9 projects.)  IFC finished FY10 with new commitments of about $30 million in 6 projects. 

Overall Development Outcomes 

18. 
Overall, as might be expected given the start-up and implementation delays, the results of the 
CPS were mixed and overall this CPSCR rates the outcome of the CPS as moderately unsatisfactory.   
Pillars II (non-oil growth) and III (social services) had overall positive results, though outcomes were 
mixed, largely due to implementation delays.  Results for Pillar I (Public Sector Governance) were 
disappointing while pillar IV (the Environment) achieved little during the CPS period.  Across the 
portfolio, projects experienced delays even in areas that were performing relatively well.  Slow project 
implementation in many instances delayed outcomes to well beyond the CPS period and in others 
rendered the outcomes uncertain at best.   

19. 
In contrast to the mixed performance of the Bank‘s program, IFC was able to deliver a strong 
investment and advisory program throughout the CPS period, resulting in s ignificant development 
outcomes.  In particular, investments through financial intermediaries have had significantly improved 
access to finance, particularly for SMEs.  Local businesses have also benefitted from IFC‘s investment in 
the retail sector, resulting in significant local purchases of goods and services.  Since FY07, IFC Advisory 
services on Leasing, Corporate Governance, Supplier Finance, Housing Finance and Investment Climate 
have reached over 600 clients in Azerbaijan and supported the enactment of several key pieces of 
legislation, facilitated access to finance, and helped to reduce the cost of registering new businesses. 

20. 
The CPS identified core higher-level progress indicators to be monitored including baselines and 
targets for 2010 based for the most part on CPIA methodology (Table 3).  These indicators were intended 
to be aggregate measures of macroeconomic stability, governance and transparency on the one hand, and 
economic and social progress on the other.  The progress report concluded tha t during the first year of the 
CPS progress on the overall reform agenda was on track.  Table 3 shows a more mixed picture by the end 
of the CPS period though the Government recorded solid progress in the key indicators related to debt 
sustainability, improvements in the environment for sustainable non-oil growth, particularly infrastructure 
development, and across the board in social services (health, education, and social protection).  The 
progress in these areas helped both to stimulate vigorous economic growth and a dramatic decline in 
poverty rates.

21. 
Over the CPS period, progress on targets for public expenditure planning and management 
varied, with the target for macroeconomic stability not being achieved, while the target for fiscal policy 
was achieved and the target for debt management exceeded.  Macro-stability proved elusive early in the 
CPS period as pro-cyclical public spending led to unsustainable growth and accelerating inflat ion.  The 
Governments response to the 2008 crisis, however, was prudent.  It increased social transfers in face of 
crisis and trimmed capital spending and reprioritized recurrent expenditures in response to lower 
revenues.  For fiscal policy, Azerbaijan has an adequate institutional framework and it served the country 

50 

 
 
 
 
well from 2000 to 2004 when overall fiscal deficits were sustainable.  However, after 2004, with rising oil 
revenues, the framework worked less well as budget formulation was driven by a polit ical imperative to 
accelerate public investment and reduce poverty. The increased spending pushed the deficit to 
unsustainable levels.  The budget adjustments in 2009 put public spending back on a sustainable footing 
while still providing the public goods and social services needed during the crisis and to support growth.   

22. 
The target for the debt policy indicator was exceeded as Azerbaijan has been prudent in external 
borrowing and has a good reputation in servicing its debt. In contrast, the indicator for public expenditure 
planning and management was not achieved.  The budget in Azerbaijan is based, in general, on national 
priorities and is prepared in a medium term expenditure framework. However, while expenditure choices 
are mostly consistent with stated development objectives, they are not subject to medium term 
expenditure ceilings and policies and programs are usually not costed. The target for transparency, 
accountability and decreased corruption also was not reached.  Good progress was made on the Extractive 
Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI), where Azerbaijan was the first country to receive validation in 
April 2009.  Less progress was made on internal and external audits of other public sector entities and in 
government procurement.  Capacity constraints in civil society the media and in public agencies hinder 
discussion of policy trade-offs and monitoring of the public sector.  Overall, the Corruption Perception 
Index for Azerbaijan remains high.  Azerbaijan ranked in the 141-145 range for 2009 down from 150-161 
for 2007.  State capture in particular continues to be perceived as a major problem.   

23. 
The indicators for sustainable and balanced growth of the non-oil sector focused on infrastructure 
quality and coverage and on utility reform where the results were generally positive.  Azerbaijan 
continued to score better than FSU countries in BEEPS for infrastructure service quality and coverage 
(electricity, telecommunications and transport). Utility rates were also increased in 2007 for gas, 
electricity and water and sanitation and again in 2009 for gas.  These increases have moved the utilities to 
closer to cost recovery. Improvements are also being made with Bank Group support in transport, rural 
infrastructure, irrigation rehabilitation, agriculture, financial services, energy and the business 
environment.  Water and sanitation is another priority but Bank support in this area is being affected by 
poor implementation.   

24. 
Overall, growth in the non-oil sector varied.  Over 2005 – 2008 economic growth averaged 24.2 
percent largely due to increased oil production, growing public expenditures, and buoyancy in the world 
economy which stimulated non-oil exports and transfers. Non-oil growth was also robust, growing at an 
average of 12.1 percent, fueled largely by a construction boom caused in part by growing public 
infrastructure investment. In 2008, growth plummeted to 2.0 percent due to the global crisis and a 
temporary decline in oil production due to technical problems. Last year saw a recovery to about 9.2 
percent largely due to restored oil production, while growth of the non-oil economy remained sluggish at 
only 2.0 percent.  The challenge going forward will be to put non-oil growth on a more sustainable path.  

25. 
Azerbaijan‘s high economic growth has translated into a sharp reduction in poverty.  The 2008 
Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) survey shows that Azerbaijan‘s poverty rate has dropped 
from 49.6 percent in 2001 to 15.8 percent in 2008.  The same survey also shows large increases in 
employment leading to a drop in unemployment to 9 percent by 2008. With the increased employment 
many women were drawn into the labor market for the first time. Aside from the growing economy, a 
strong rise in wages, and a well targeted and an easily access ible social assistance program contributed to 
the impressive decline in poverty. 

26. 
Targets for health and education were exceeded reflecting substantial progress by the 
Government, with assistance of the Bank, in implementing ambitious reform programs.  In the health 
sector, health care facilities are being rationalized and upgraded, a human resource strategy is under 
preparation and a certification process for health care professionals is being developed.  New clinical 

51 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
guidelines to improve the quality of care also have been adopted and training on implementation of the 
guidelines has been widespread.  For education, the reform program is focused on new curricula for 
grades 1-11, in-service teacher training, improved student assessments and support for pre -schools.  Work 
is also underway on school financing and rationalization of school facilities though a consensus has not 
yet been achieved on moving forward with these reforms.  Azerbaijan participated for the first time in the 
Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), for which the results were published in December 
2007 and another round is scheduled for later this year.  The target for social protection was achieved.   
The Targeted Social Assistance (TSA) program continues to be improved. By December 1, 2009 about 
132,000 families were receiving TSA benefits. Surveys showed that social assistance is reaching the poor 
and having an impact on poverty reduction.  Targets for the pension have also been reached.  Pension 
reforms focus on fiscal sustainability, strengthened revenue collection and improved administration. The 
retirement age has been increased and most of the formally employed have been registered in the social 
insurance system. The number of contributors has increased substantially, there are no arrears in pensions 
and social allowances and most beneficiaries use ATMS to receive benefits.  

27. 
The targets for environmental management and rehabilitation of contaminated land on the 
Apsheron Peninsula and reduced green house emissions have not been fully achieved.    Investments with 
Bank financing to improve solid waste management on the peninsula initially and then countrywide are 
getting underway. These investments will directly contribute to both the rehabilitation and emission‘s 
indicators. On the other hand planned investments in the clean-up of contaminated areas on the peninsula 
did not take place. Also, a Bank financed project to support development of two national parks failed to 
achieve its development objects.  The parks were established but none of the planned investments to 
develop the park and support economic development in surrounding areas were made.     

28. 
Governance – A Crosscutting Objective of the CPS.  The CPS laid out a crosscutting 
governance action plan that was to be supported by the Bank, IFC, and other development partners.  In 
essence, planned AAA and projects all taken together were posited to form an elaborate governance 
action plan that would be monitored through a coordinated Governance Monitoring Framework.  Since 
this objective cut across pillars where performance was mixed, it is not surprising that progress on this 
objective was also mixed.  Areas with notable achievements included oil revenues management with 
Azerbaijan certification as EITI compliant in April 2009, and upgraded human resources in hiring of 
judges, and improved public sector salaries across the board that could serve to limit rent seeking 
behavior.  Also encouraging were important improvements in the tariff structure for utilities and in 
targeting social assistance and in using cards and ATM‘s for assistance payments to reduce corruption 
potential.  At the local level, good progress was made in strengthening water users associations under the 
irrigation projects, community participation in decision-making on local infrastructure under the 
Azerbaijan Rural Infrastructure Project (AZRIP), and the emergence of parent/teacher councils in schools 
under the education projects.  On the other hand, fewer outcomes were achieved on the reform of budget 
planning and management and of public administration, financial management and procurement. Overall, 
Azerbaijan continues to be perceived as being plagued by corruption in the form of rent seeking behavior 
and state capture, and the governance agenda will continue to be an important cross cutting theme in the 
Bank‘s assistance program.  

A. Overview of Results Delivered by the CPS Program. 

29. 
This section reviews the results in each of the four pillars based on the results matrix as presented 
in the CPS.  The results matrix was revised and amended at the time of the progress report to reflect the 
expanded lending program and give greater specificity to some of the outcome indicators. Items 
appearing in bold in the matrices below were added at the time of the progress report.  

52 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Pillar 1 – Improving the Quality and Transparency in Public Sector Governance 

30. 
Improving the Quality and Transparency in Public Sector Governance.  This pillar sought to 
address weaknesses in public service delivery stemming from governance prob lems and capacity 
constraints.  It covered macroeconomic stability, public expenditure planning and management, 
transparency and accountability in managing public resources, improved corporate governance, and a 
strengthened justice system.  Bank assistance was to be delivered through dialogue, programmatic public 
expenditure reviews, PEFA and CFAA updates, a CEM, an IDF grant for e-procurement and one project 
intervention – the Corporate and Public Sector Accountability Project (CAPSAP) 

1A.  Maintaining a Stable Macro Economic Environment 

31. 
The CPS recognized the challenge Government would face in maintaining macro -economic 
stability in view of rising oil revenues and the investment boom underway at the time.  The CPS indicated 
that close policy dialogue would be necessary and indicated that the IMF, through article IV consultations 
and TA would take the lead in exchange rate and monetary policies and that the Bank would provide 
support through just-in-time policy papers and a Country Economic Memorandum.

Commission was not operational in 
2010 and future is uncertain. 

Rating for 1A -  Moderately 
Satisfactory 

32. 
Overall, the CPSCR rates this component as moderately satisfactory. The Government 
demonstrated its commitment to transparency in the use of oil funds and progress with EITI initiative was 
highly satisfactory with Azerbaijan becoming the first country to complete validation.  Macro -economic 
stability proved to be more of a challenge, especially in the first two years of the CPS when large 
increases in Government spending on top of a booming economy created inflationary pressures with 

53 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
inflation reaching 20 percent in 2008.  Overall, recurrent spending between 2005 and 2008 increased four 
times, driven by increases in the wage bill, due both new hiring and salary increases. These increases 
coupled with equally dramatic increases in capital spending drove the budget to levels deemed to be 
fiscally unsustainable based on projections of oil production.  During this period, the policy dialogue by 
the Bank and IMF had limited impact.  In 2009, the situation changed as the Government, stung by the 
financial crisis and reduced oil revenues, reprioritized and reduced spending in 2009 to about 15 percent 
below budgeted amounts.  The reduced spending resulted from not spending part of the capital budget and 
cutting recurrent spending, namely wages and transfers.  The 2010 budget was then set at 2009 actual 
expenditure levels, reducing the budget relative to non-oil GDP from 77 percent to an expected 62 
percent.  This restored fiscal discipline is a significant achievement.   

33. 
The crisis also generated a more receptive audience for policy dialogue, which was aided by an 
extensive dissemination effort of the CEM throughout FY09.  A high-level policy forum held in October 
2009 further enhanced the policy dialogue. The Forum, jointly sponsored by the Bank and the 
Government, was meant to build on the dissemination of the CEM to allow top Government officials and 
policy makers to focus on the challenges facing Azerbaijan in its efforts to diversify the economy and 
develop non-oil sources of economic growth.  Participants in the forum included a distinguished panel of 
experts with experience in other countries in handling the sorts of challenges Azerbaijan faces.  The 
forum stimulated a lively debate that resulted in a number of important initiatives, including efforts by the 
Government to articulate new development and export diversification strategies.    

1B. Establishing effective public expenditure planning and management 

34. 
The CPS intended to support improving the MTEP and PIP process through the Programmatic 
Public Expenditure Review (PPER) and TA.  The Bank‘s support for the MTEF and PIP mechanisms was 
aimed at ensuring that financing for priority needs and strengthening the linkages between Government 
policy objectives and annual public expenditure programs.   

CPS Outcome that the Bank 
Group Expected to Help Realize 
by mid-2010 

Improved economic budget planning 
and reporting including stronger PIP 
priority setting and linking the 
budget and MTEF to long-run 
sustainability. A benchmarking 
PEFA self-assessment prepared in 
late 2007 will be an annual exercise 
to continuously improve these 
systems.   

Milestones to Track Outcomes

Period 

MTEF and PIP of increasing quality

Not Achieved. Regulatory reforms 
to strengthen Budget planning were 
introduced during the previous CAS, 
but progress in using both the MTEF 
and PIP was slow. 2008 PEFA 
completed but unpublished and there 
have been no subsequent updates.  
PETS done for education only. 

Rating for 1B - Unsatisfactory 

35. 
This component is rated as unsatisfactory as progress has been slow in improving budget 
planning and reporting.  The budget in Azerbaijan is nominally prepared in a medium term expenditure 
framework. At the legislation level the link between priorities and the medium term framework is 
provided in the Budget System‘s Law.  However, the practical application of this link is weak.  While 

54 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
expenditure choices are generally consistent with the country‘s development objectives, they are not 
subject to medium term expenditure ceilings.  Also, priority setting in the Public Investment Planning is 
weak and individual projects are not appraised which made it difficult to control the levels and content of 
public investment in infrastructure. The Ministries of Finance and Economic Development are aware of 
these difficulties and are working with several development partners in public expenditure management to 
strengthen its capacities in budget management.  

1C.  Increasing Transparency and Accountability in the Management of Public Resources 

36. 
Bank support for this component focused on assistance to improve internal audit, financial 
management, and accounting processes in Government entities and to improve public procurement.  
Tools included assessment instruments such as ROSC, PEFA, and CPAR and an IDF grant for the 
introduction of e-procurement.   

CPS Outcome that the Bank 
Group Expected to Help Realize 
by mid-2010 

Strengthen the internal audit, 
financial management and 
accounting processes of government 
entities in accordance with NASBO.  

CPS Outcome 
that 
the Bank 
Group Expected to Help Realize

37. 
Some progress was made on internal audits but the roll out to Government entities will be 
delayed to beyond the CPS period.  Work on the ROSC was completed as planned, including a ROSC of 
State Owned Enterprises.  Less progress was made on the implementation of the PFM framework that 

55 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
will also be delayed well beyond the CPS period.  For procurement, the CPS objectives were not 
achieved, as the IDF-grant on E-procurement was never utilized.  Government is continuing to implement 
its action plan for country procurement and financial accountability, which was developed in 2002, 
though progress is slow.  Work has focused on preparing bidding documents and developing an internet 
site for the procurement agency.  A CPAR was carried out in 2008 with extensive collaboration with the 
Government, but it is not a public document.  It found significant shortcomings in the legislative 
framework, a lack of clarity on roles at the institutional level, low capacity of procuring agencies and 
weak oversight.  Overall, this component is rated as moderately unsatisfactory due to delays in 
implementation of the PFM framework and the failure of the IDF for e-procurement.   

1D.  Improving governance, accounting, and auditing in the corporate and financial sectors 

38. 
This component focused on measures to improve financial reporting, accounting and auditing in 
the corporate sector.  Measures were also included on improving corporate governance.  Bank Group 
assistance in this area was to be provided through IFC Advisory Services, namely the Azerbaijan 
Corporate Governance Project (ACGP), and the Bank financed Corporate and Public Sector 
Accountability Project (CAPSAP).

Achieved. It is estimated that over 
$120 million in investments were 
stimulated in the private sector due 
to improved corporate governance.  

Rating for 1D – Moderately 
Satisfactory 

39. 
Good progress has been made in improving governance, accounting, and auditing in the 
corporate and financial sectors due largely to the good results achieved by the IFC’s ACGP.  Progress in 
this area, particularly the improvements in CG legislation in 2008, boosted Azerbaijan‘s performance in 
the Doing Business Survey. The project also helped to stimulate over $120 million in investments in the 
private sector due to improved corporate governance.   On the other hand, CAPSAP, approved in March 
2008, has failed to get off the ground limiting progress in spreading IFRS to the corporate sector.  The 
project is currently rated as unsatisfactory and the outcomes it supports are uncertain and at best will be 
delayed well beyond the CPS period. Overall this component can only be rated as moderately satisfactory 
due to the delays in CAPSAP. 

1E. Strengthening the Judicial System to Conform with International Best Practice 

40. 
This component was intended to support the government‘s reform program aimed at improving 
the functioning of civil, criminal and economic courts through strengthened management capacity, 
upgraded court facilities, and improved professionalism of judges.  The instrument to provide this system 
was the Judicial Modernization Project (JMP) that was approved in FY2006.

the end of calendar 2010. 

Partial Achievement expected but 
with significant delays beyond the 
CPS period due to delays in JPM 
implementation.  Designs for all 22 
courts are underway, but the number 
of courts to be renovated will be 
reduced to four, due to changes in 
design and increased cost.   First 
court not to be completed before end

Partially Achieved.  Training was 
not a focus of project – though it 
supports indirectly training programs 
for new judges – Around 150 new 
judges have received training and 
certification in a Government 
financed training program.     

Rating for 1E – Moderately 
Unsatisfactory 

41. 
Some progress in achieving the CPS outcomes for this component is only now possible after a 
significantly delays in the JMP.  The project, approved in FY2006, is only now showing progress after an 
18-month hiatus due largely to Bank staffing issues.  A functional analysis of the document and case 
management system across all institutions in the justice system has been completed.  It will guide specific 
upgrades to be financed by the JMP, with contracts for the work expected to be signed at the end of 
calendar 2010.  The number of courts to be renovated has been reduced due to design changes to 
accommodate more judges and increases in construction costs (12 instead of 4 judges to be assigned to 
each court).  The project is currently undergoing restructuring. The component is rated as moderately 
unsatisfactory due to the long delays in project implementation.  

Rating of Pillar One – Moderately Unsatisfactory  

42. 
The CPSCR rates Pillar I as moderately unsatisfactory. There was excellent progress in 
establishing a prudent and transparent framework for managing growing oil revenues. Moreover, after a 
large increase in fiscal spending in the first half of the CPS, fiscal spending was brought back to a 
sustainable level during the second half.  Good progress also was made through the IFC supported 

58 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ACGP in improving the corporate governance, accounting and auditing in the corporate and financial 
sectors with most outcomes achieved.  These results were not matched in public sector management and 
planning where little progress was made. Progress in increasing transparency and accountability in the 
management of public resources was slower than anticipated with outcomes, while likely, delayed beyond 
the CPS period.  The slow start up and uncertain future of CAPSAP has contributed to these 
disappointing results.  Similarly, progress on the outcomes in the modernization of the justice system is 
moving forward but will be well delayed beyond the CPS period.  

Pillar II.  Supporting Sustainable Growth of the Non-Oil Economy 

43. Within Pillar II, the CPS supported seven areas: (i) expanding access to credit and financial 
services especially in rural areas; (ii) creating a competitive business regulatory environment including by 
reducing obstacles to starting and running a business; (iii) developing rural infrastructure and services; 
(iv) improving the transit corridor; (v) improving the coverage of water supply systems; (vi) improving 
the reliability of electricity and gas supplies; and, (vii) improving the financial viabili ty in  the utility 
sector.   Bank assistance focused on investment operations, technical assistance and advisory services, 
and support for continued governance reforms, particularly in the utility sector.   IFC provided advisory 
services and investments to support the financial sector and SME development, advisory services to 
improve the business enabling environment, and direct private sector investments.  IFC‘s advisory work 
with suppliers to BP contributed to $309 million in contracts between BP and loca l SMEs (exceeding the 
project target of $200 million). 

2A. Expanding Access to Credit and Financial Services especially in Rural Areas 

44. 
The CPS noted that a key element of the Government‘s strategy to develop the non -oil economy 
was the development of financial services.  The Bank assistance for improved financial services was to be 
provided by ongoing projects and TA (Financial Services Development Project (FSDP), and Financial 
Services Technical Assistance) and a proposed project, Financial Sector Modernization, which had been 
proposed for FY2008 but was later dropped from the lending program.  IFC provided direct investments 
and technical assistance in financial and micro-finance institutions, and for leasing, housing finance, and 
supplier finance facilities.  Since the onset of the crisis, IFC has also increased the availability of trade 
finance in Azerbaijan as in the rest of the region.

Good progress was made in most elements of this component. Particular success was achieved in 
improving access to AzerPost services in rural areas, expanding microfinance and SME lending financed 
by IFC and in leasing and the Mortgage Law again with the support of IFC through its advisory services.   
IFC undertook tracking of reach for both its microfinance and SME windows through client banks and 
found that the reach for both had expanded.  Moreover, IFC provided advisory services to client banks 
aimed at managing risk.  The decision to drop the Financial Modernization Project slowed work on 
capital market development, though this may be taken up again in the next CPS period.  Overall, the 
CPSCR rates this sub-component as satisfactory.  

2B.  Create a competitive business regulatory environment, including by reducing obstacles to 
starting and running a business. 

46. 
The CPS emphasized the importance improving the business regulatory environment for 
sustained growth in the non-oil sector.  The Bank‘s assistance in this area was to be provided by 
analytical work, periodic surveys of the business-enabling environment, and advisory services, 
particularly from IFC.   

CPS Outcome

the Bank 
Group Expected to Help Realize 
by mid-2010 
Streamlining administrative and 
regulatory procedures in starting

Rating for 2 B – Moderately 
Satisfactory 

47. 
Overall, the CPSCR rates this component as moderately satisfactory. Progress was made in 
improving the administrative and regulatory environment for business as reflected in the substantial 
improvement by Azerbaijan in the Doing Business survey that went up from 96 at the beginning of the 
CPS period to 38 in the 2010 survey.  Establishment of the one stop shop has shortened the time and 
streamlined the procedures and reduced the costs for registering a new business. Overall, reforms on 
business entry are estimated to reduce the cost of registration for SMEs by $8.3 million per year. Less 
progress was made on licensing, permits and business inspections, all difficult areas according to IFC's 
2009 SME Survey and the 2010 Doing Business Survey.  This seems largely due to difficulties in getting 
sufficient traction in the Government for these reforms, even though the IFC investment climate AS has 
raised awareness in Government on the need for reforms in these areas.  In fact a presidential decree on 
April 13, 2010 instructed the Cabinet of Ministers to prepare recommendations for unified regulations of 
inspections and inspections registry at the Ministry of Justice before the end of June.   

2C Developing Rural Infrastructure and Services 

48. 
The CPS argued that rural development was key for sustained growth and reduced poverty and 
placed considerable emphasis on supporting investments in rural areas.  The primary instrument in this 
area was investment operations including the Agricultural Development and Credit Project (ADCPII) the 
Avian Influenza Preparedness Program, the Rural Investment Project and the Irrigation System 
Improvement Project.  All these projects were started prior to the CPS period though additional financing 
for the rural investment project was approved in FY2008.  A Real Estate Registration project was added 
in FYO7 to build on work in this area financed under the ADCPII. A follow-on to the Irrigation System 
Improvement Project was put into the 2009/10 program but project processing is now anticipated to begin 
in FY11.

49. 
Substantial progress was made in improving rural infrastructure and services as the projects 
supporting this part of the CPS have been well implemented and uniformly successful in delivering 
results.  The rural infrastructure project, ADCPII and the irrigation project have rehabilitated rural 
infrastructure, extended credit to farmers and rural entrepreneurs and have developed systems to deliver 
agricultural knowledge and services to farm communities.  The Real Estate Registration Project got off to 
a slow start with implementation, due largely to the consolidation of the two project agencies.  An action 
plan to resolve outstanding issues is being successfully implemented and it is expected that the project 
will meet its development outcomes.   Overall, the CPSCR rates this part of pillar 2 as satisfactory. 

2D  Improving Transit Corridors and Traffic Management 

50. 
The Government places high priority on improving both roads and rail transit systems and 
planned major investments for both for the CPS period and beyond.  The Bank is supporting roads 
investments with three investment operations during the CPS period for total commitments of $921 
million or 42 percent of the current total portfolio (includes highway III).  The Bank is also supporting 
Government efforts to modernize the rail system with the ongoing Railway Transport and Trade 
Facilitation Project that is intended to support the first phase of a comprehensive railway modernization.

Transit systems in Azerbaijan have been substantially upgraded, though delays have hampered 
progress. The three roads projects are moving forward, though there are some delays with the first two 
projects due to land acquisition issues.  The railway project also got off to a slow start and needed to be 
restructured before signing to accommodate changes in project scope and the institutional arrangements.  
The delays in signing and effectiveness of the railway project will push outcomes for that project 
significantly beyond the CPS period, though implementation is now proceedings satisfactorily. The 
creation of Azerbaijan Railway as a commercial entity by separating out regulatory functions was a major 
accomplishment. Overall the CPSCR rates this component as moderately satisfactory due to the delays in 
project implementation.   

2E.  Increasing the Quality and Coverage of Water Supply 

52. 
The CPS recognized that large investments were required to rehabilitate and improve water and 
sanitation in Baku and in secondary cities and towns.  The Bank carried out a water sector study in FY06 
that was to underpin a series of National Water Supply and Sanitation Projects.  The CPS indicated that a 
sector wide approach would be used to finance the rehabilitation of water and wastewater facilities in 
selected secondary cities, and support the water supply company, AzerSu, to improve its capacity and 

66 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
commercial viability.  The first National Water Supply and Sanitation Projec t in support of this approach 
was approved in FY07, and a second was approved in FY08.  

CPS Outcome that the Bank 
Group Expected to Help Realize 
by mid-2010 
Improved water

Rating: For 2E -Unsatisfactory 

53. 
Significant delays in implementation and low disbursement rates for the two water projects have 
made achievement of outcomes uncertain and pushed out to well beyond the CPS period. Both projects 
are currently rated as unsatisfactory due largely to implementation capacity (the first project) and 
procurement problems (both projects). The first project suffers from inadequate preparation and has been 
plagued by procurement problems.  It is rated as U for both PDO and IP and has disbursed less than one 
percent since being approved in June 2007. The second project was included in the FY08 lending 
program in spite the problems that were apparent not only in the first project, but which also plagued an 
earlier water project in Baku.  Moreover, it was rushed to the board in FY08 with limited preparation in 
order not to lose IDA financing at the end of IDA 14. Neither the works nor the institutional strengthening 
envisaged in the projects has gotten underway and disbursements are nil.  The second project was 
restructured after signing to accommodate a Government request to change implement ing agencies as 

67 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
AzerSu continued to demonstrate limited implementation capacity.  The restructuring has been completed 
and the project declared effective.  Some progress in getting procurement underway has been achieved 
since the switch in implementing agencies though actual disbursements are not expected to increase much 
until FY11. Due to the problems with both projects, this component of the pillar is rated as 
unsatisfactory.  

2F.  Improving the Reliability of Energy Provision 

54. 
In the energy sector, the Bank‘s support was to be delivered through the Power Transmission 
Project which was approved prior to the CPS and which helped to finance the introduction of an upgraded 
electricity dispatch system and limited upgrading of the electricity network through the replacement of 
outdated equipment.  The Bank‘s assistance was complimented by investments by the Government and 
other bilateral and multilateral institutions in power generation facilities.  Parallel reforms included 
increased energy tariffs in 2007, expanded installation of meters, and strengthened payment collection 
arrangements all aimed at improving cost recovery.

Improvements in the power and gas sectors over the CPS period were recorded and the successful 
completion of the power transmission project will lead to improved efficiency in power transmission. For 
power the new power dispatch system is being installed with small delays anticipated beyond the end of 
the CPS period.  Still, system reliability is already improving.  The 2008 Doing Business Survey showed 
improved system reliability as business experienced a 20 percent reduction in power outages, and reduced 
sales losses by 40 percent compared with 2005 survey results. The Government also took steps towards 
improving the financial viability and governance in the sector, through increased tariffs and in the case of 
Azerenerji moving to IFRS for its financial statements. Azerenerji is also planning other improvements in 
its financial management including external audits by international auditors. The decision not to go 
forward with a gas infrastructure project limited the Bank‘s involvement in the sector.  Overall, the 
CPSCR rates this component as moderately satisfactory. 

2G  Increasing the Financial Viability of the Utility Sector 

56. 
This component of the CPS was intended to support Government efforts to improve the 
performance of the utility sector through reforms aimed at commercializing the utilities, reducing 
subsidies, improving tariff policy and the regulatory framework, and improving accounting in the various 
utilities through adoption of IFRS.  The targeted social safety net introduced in 2006 was to help the most 
vulnerable afford essential utility services in face of rising tariffs.   The Bank‘s assistance to help achieve 
these outcomes was to be through AAA, including IFC‘s work on corporate governance, CAPSAP and 
sector projects assisting the various utilities, and the Pensions and Social Assistance Project.

water and sanitation services in 
January 2007. The tariff adjustment

Rating for 2G – Moderately 
Unsatisfactory 

57. 
Some progress was made in improving the efficiency and financial viability of the utilities, 
though the progress was more modest then had been anticipated in the CPS.  Tariffs were adjusted 
substantially for all utilities in 2007, and again in 2009 for Azerigas and a Tariff Council was established 
and is functioning. Progress on regulatory reform and utility restructuring on the other hand was 
disappointing. Given the mixed results in these areas, this component of the Pillar is rated as moderately 
unsatisfactory. 

Rating for Pillar 2 –Moderately Satisfactory 

58. 
For most areas under this pillar the anticipated outcomes were achieved or will be achieved w ith 
some delays. Strong performance in achieving results was recorded in financial services, rural 
infrastructure, agricultural services, irrigation and roads.  Other projects related to rail, and power 
transmission are progressing but have experienced delays that will push outcomes beyond the CPS 
timeframe.  There also was progress in the business regulatory environment, and improving the financial 
viability of the utility sector, though more effort will be required on licensing and inspections for business 
and tariff policy and financial management for the utilities sector.  One area where the eventual 
achievement of outcomes is uncertain is water supply and sanitation where delays and management 
problems continue to hinder project implementation.  Overall , this CPSCR rates the results for Pillar 2 as 
moderately satisfactory 

Pillar III – Improving the Quality of and Access to Social Services 

59. Within Pillar III, the CPS focused on four goals including: (i) improving the quality and coverage 
of health care services; (ii) modernizing the education system; (iii) improving efficiency and coverage of 
social protection systems; and, (iv) improving living conditions and economic opportunities for internally 
displaced people.  The Bank support for this pillar focused on investment operations in health, education,

Bank support the health sector during the CPS period was a continuation of activities started in 
the previous CAS through a small-scale health LIL implemented in five pilot regions and a Health Sector 
Review.  Based on these initiatives, the Bank during the CPS period and beyond is supporting a Health 
Sector Reform Project.  Key objectives of the project are to build capacity in the Ministry of Health to 
guide its comprehensive reform of the healthcare system, rationalize and improve health service delivery, 
ensure sustainable financing of the system, and address long-term human resource needs in the sector.  

CPS Outcome that the Bank

Bank assistance in support of Azerbaijan‘s health care reform initiatives is helping to improve 
access to high quality medical services in Azerbaijan, with a focus on five pilot regions.   With support 
from the Bank financed Health Sector Reform Project, the rationalization of the health care network 
across the country has begun.   Initial results indicate that excess hospital bed capacity is being reduced, 
and the rehabilitation and construction of new facilities are in accordance with the Master Plan. In pilot 
regions two new 100-bed hospitals are being constructed and tendering for three village hospitals, nine 
primary care facilities, and related medical equipment will be undertaken later in 2010.  The allocation of 
health personnel is also being adjusted based on population-based ratios developed under the project 
rather than on the basis of number of facilities. Although still low compared to countries with similar per 
capita income, government spending on health has increased over the CPS period. The increase is 
facilitating improved health infrastructure, medical equipment and supplies . However, out of pocket 
expenditures on health remain unacceptably high. Health care delivery is also being strengthened by the 
development of new clinical standards and protocols, particularly for maternal and child care services, 
and the provision of related training. Improvements are beginning to be recorded in health outcomes. 
Childhood immunizations are being sustained at very high level, deliveries at health facilities have 
increased by nearly 20 percent, and there has been a 14 percent increase in pre-natal consultations, all 
important contributions to decreased infant and maternal mortality.  The project also supports 
improvements in the supply and use of drugs, the development of electronic medical records, and the 
introduction of new resource allocation mechanisms to link budgets to performance and outputs. 
Moreover, preparation is underway of medical education reforms and of a licensing and accreditation 
system for physicians.  The political decision to provide health insurance for the poor is lagging in spite 
of the fact that some of the needed systems have been developed with project support.  Given that the 
health system restructuring process is still under implementation, and piloting of a health insurance 
scheme for the poor is delayed, this component of pillar III is rated moderately satisfactory.  It is 
anticipated, however, that expected outcomes will be largely achieved by project closing in 2012. 

3B -- Modernizing the Education System 

61. 
The Government placed considerable emphasis on accelerating reforms in the education over the 
CPS period.  The Bank‘s support to educational reform was through the Education Sector Development 
APL, the first phase of which was approved in FY2003 and which closed in September 2009.  The second 
phase was approved in FY2008.  Both projects focused on the quality of general education, namely 
curriculum development, teacher education, new education materials and school improvements.  The APL 
also focused on education financing.  In addition to general education, the CPS included support higher 
education and the progress report added the possibility of a vocational education project.   Neither of 
these was processed in the CPS period given the overall slow portfolio implementation.

The Government with Bank assistance continued to support wide reaching reforms in basic and 
secondary education during the CPS period. The focus of the reforms was on the development of a new 
national curriculum framework and syllabi for grades 1-11, training of teachers, establishment of a new 
national system of student assessment, and the development of new per capita financing arrangements for 
education.  Progress in these areas is evident, most notably with the development of the national 
curriculum reform and its implementation for grade 1 nation-wide, doubling of teachers trained in 
comparison to the original CPS target of 9,000, and the piloting of per-capita financing.  The Bank 
supported these efforts through the Education Sector Development Project, approved in 2003, which fully 
achieved its development objective of improving the efficiency of general education and led to the 
Second Education Sector Development Project, approved in 2008. Like other projects approved in 2008, 
this project has gotten off to a slow start, though the reason was that there were still resources available 
under the first project that the Government wanted to use before it closed.  A recent concern is that plans 
for reforms of education financing and rationalization of school facilities are facing some opposition and 
may be delayed. A project to support reforms in tertiary education had been planned at the time of the 
progress report and preparation of a project will be initiated in FY11.  The project remains a high priority 
as Azerbaijan faces major challenges in tertiary education.  Overall the Bank’s involvement in the sector 
has been successful, but this CPSCR rates this component as moderately satisfactory due to the delays in 
the second project, the concerns about the future of reforms in education financing and rationalization of 
facilities, and the slippage of the project in support of tertiary education. 

3C  Targeting Social Assistance and Improving the Pension System 

63. 
The CPS provided support for structural support of the social safety net through the ongoing 
Pensions and Social Assistance Project (extended closing date to February 2011) and a follow on social 
protection project approved in FY2008.  Analytical and advisory work was supported by the 
programmatic poverty assessment and was to include a social protection note.

Government has undertaken significant reforms of its social safety net and pension system with 
effective Bank support during the CPS period.  The government reforms of the social safety net program 
were rapid, comprehensive and at the forefront of international practice.  Since 2006 when the Ministry of 
Labor and Social Protection of the Population (MLSPP) introduced unified Targeted Social Assistance 
(TSA), significant progress has been made. A TSA and social benefit management MIS systems for mean 
and asset testing has been introduced, TSA application and administration systems have been 
strengthened, 75 regional social protection centers have been opened, and successful public information 
campaigns on social assistance and social protection have been undertaken.  Social security coverage has 
also been modernized, covering 94% of formally employed and with the overall number of contributors 
increasing by 40% in the period between 2003 and 2009.  Satisfaction with the services provided both in 
pensions and social assistance has increased and the TSA has proven to be well targeted.  Project 
monitoring for the first Bank financed project showed that it has achieved all of its target outcomes and 
the second project is well underway following a long delay in project effectiveness.   Overall this 
component of Pillar III performed well and is rated satisfactory.

65. 
The CPS aimed to support improved living and economic conditions through the Internally 
Displaced People Economic Development Support Project, which was approved prior to the CPS period 
and is slated to run until the end of 2011 following approval of additional financing and a three year 
extension in December of 2008.  The project aims at financing basic social and economic infrastructure 
and micro-enterprises.

overall the project remains on track 
to achieve planned outcomes by

and free utilities.  Bank support to the State Committee for Refugees and IDPs is being provided the 
Economic Development Support for Internally Displaced People Project, which was provided additional 
financing and an extension in FY08, the programmatic poverty assessment and Technical Assistance.  
The refinanced project got off to a slow start due to delays in effectiveness, and problems in processing 
counterpart payments.  The counterpart funding problem has now been resolved and project activity is 
picking up and end project targets are expected to be achieved by the closing date . Given the slow start 
after additional financing was approved, this component of Pillar III is rated as moderately satisfactory. 

Rating for Pillar III – Moderately Satisfactory 

67. 
The CPSPR rates Pillar III as moderately satisfactory.  The Bank’s assistance in improving the 
quality of and access to social services has been largely successful.  The Bank’s support for health care, 
education and social protection reforms have been instrumental in advancing a high priority reform 
agenda for the Government and the support for the economic well being of IDP’s has been successful in 
improving the lives of those who have been resettled.    Project interventions have been well designed and 
implementation across the pillar is going well, though the projects approved in FY08 were not immune to 
the problems that emerged that year.  Those problems delayed implementation and outcomes giving rise 
to the moderately satisfactory rating.  Nonetheless, the projects, and analytical work underway now 
provide a firm basis for continued Bank support for reforms and investments in social services.

of the oil industry and other industries, including legacy pollution, especially in the coastal areas around 
Baku.  Second, was support for sustainable natural resource management, through improved biodiversity 
conservation and the introduction of improved resource management and sustainable employment 
opportunities in two mountainous parks. The Bank was also to assist with Natural Disaster Management 
Review.

Improved environmental management is a key Government priority as evidenced by the 
Presidential declaration of 2010 as the year of the environment.  The challenges facing the Government in 
improving environmental management are daunting.  The President approved a Comprehensive Action 
Plan for Improving Environmental Situation in Azerbaijan (ESP) in 2006. It envisages a w ide range of 
activities including for example clean up operations, upgrading waste water treatment facilities, 
developing environmental standards, and improving legislation.  Implementation of the action plan has 
been slow to get started and it is likely the plan will be extended beyond the 2010 end date.  One notable 
accomplishment is the work underway with Bank support on solid waste management.  Initial work is 
focusing on the Absheron Peninsula. A Joint Stock Company was established in 2008 to manage Baku 
municipal solid waste and the company as already improved municipal waste collection and is 
rehabilitating a major landfill to meet international standards.  On the other hand, Bank supported 
activities in support of oil spill clean-up and remediation of radioactive waste never got off the ground as 
the projects were withdrawn after long delays in project signing due to a change in the Government‘s 
concept for dealing with legacy pollution in the Abserhon Peninsula.  The results were also disappointing 
for Bank financed efforts to restore and expand the network of national parks and protected areas to 
preserve biodiversity and promote sustainable multiple use in the parks and surrounding areas.  Under the 
Bank financed project, only one of the five key results, establishment of SDNP and enlargement of ONP, 
was fully completed. All other activities failed to achieve results, including land use planning and 
implementation, community-based tree planting, adoption of modern livestock husbandry practices, and 
support to environmentally friendly, financially sound, small/medium enterprises, as the project closed 
with unsatisfactory ratings for both development objectives and implementation and with virtually no 
disbursements. Also no work was done on a Natural Disaster Management Review.  Overall, given the 
problems with the portfolio and delays in implementation of the remaining operation, the CPSCR rates 
this pillar as unsatisfactory.   

III. 

Rating Bank Performance 

70. 
The Bank misjudged client ownership by increasing lending in FY08, however it was able to shift 
tack successfully and slow down new operations and focus on implementation in the second two years. 
Overall implementation difficulties overwhelmed the CPS, particularly after FY2008 when the surge in 
lending exposed a number of problems, including opaque decisions making and consensus building 
processes in Government, insufficient readiness of new projects going to the board and weak 
implementation capacity.  These problems slowed disbursements, led to the dropping of some already 
approved projects, and rendered some CPS outcomes uncertain and caused many others to slip to well 
beyond the CPS period.  There were, however, relative strong performance in key sectors such as roads 
and the rural projects in pillar 2, and the projects in pillar 3. Key to these successes was previous Bank 
involvement in the sectors, relatively strong implementation capacity, strong Bank teams, and solid client 
ownership.  IFC also was fairly successful in implementing its programs, particularly in micro and SME 
finance and corporate governance. The Bank also failed to gain traction in its policy dialogue early in the 
CPS period but new impetus was given to the dialogue with the widespread dissemination of the CEM 
followed by the successful High Level Policy forum that yielded a number of follow-on activities.  

Lending 

71. 
Existing Operations.  Operations that were carried over from the previous CAS were by-in-large 
the best performing projects in the portfolio, which is understandable because they were mature 
investments with established implementation arrangements.  Moreover , the more successful projects 
approved during the CPS period were follow-ons to projects from the previous CPS (such as the 
education and roads projects). An exception was the Judicial Modernization project which entered the 
CPS period in unsatisfactory status and remained there until only very recently.   

79 

 
 
 
 
 
 
72. 
Delivery of New Operations - At mid-term Bank management agreed to the Government‘s 
request to greatly increase investment lending to leverage Government‘s increased spending on 
infrastructure development and rehabilitation.  The decision was based on a desire to respond to a strong 
Government request, the opportunity to utilize remaining IDA resources as IDA14 was drawing to a 
close, and the availability of ample IBRD resources for Azerbaijan as a new IBRD borrower.  The Bank 
responded by delivering an expanded lending program in FY08.  A total of 11 operations valued at more 
than $1.2 billion were delivered to the Board more than double the number of projects and quadruple the 
lending volume envisaged for FY08 in the original CPS.  Management was aware that the rapid ramping 
up of lending was risky.   In the CPS progress report, implementation capacity was identif ied as a risk 
given the rapid build-up in projects and the fact that the Bank would be working with several new 
implementing partners.  Mitigating measures were identified to address this risk including efforts to build 
improved systems and a strong cadre of project management staff through embedding capacity building in 
individual projects.  The progress report also noted that the portfolio prior to the expansion, while 
generally satisfactory, was beginning to experience some implementation issues as evidenced by a 
dramatic slowdown in disbursements in 2007. 

73. 
Unfortunately, by the end of FY09 it was readily apparent that the Bank had underestimated the 
extent of the implementation risk and that the mitigation efforts were insufficient.  Capacity constraints at 
the project level slowed project start up in the young portfolio and disbursement rates plummeted further 
(down to less than 7 percent in FY09).  Another constraint also loomed large that was not anticipated by 
the Bank at the time of the progress report. Slow and uncertain Government decision making and 
consensus formation capacity delayed project signing and effectiveness for many of the projects approved 
in FY08 and to the withdrawal of the two environment operations because a consensus in Government 
could not be reached to authorize loan signature.  Finally, the rapid expansion of lending resulted in 
instances of poor project readiness, particularly procurement readiness.  The push in FY08 to deliver the 
larger lending program made it difficult for project teams to ensure that projects were sufficiently 
prepared to implement quickly. Another complicating factor was the large turn-over of staff in the country 
team, which particularly affected the judicial and water projects.     

74. 
The Bank and the Government have been proactive in addressing portfolio performance.  First, 
the Bank strengthened capacity in the country office with the placement in Baku of additional staff in 
procurement, water supply, and roads and moved to withdraw the environment projects.  It also held with 
Government a joint portfolio review in September 2009 that led to an action plan for the Government and 
the Bank focusing on three outcomes: (a) monitoring implementation of portfolio on a sustainable basis; 
b) accelerating achievement of development results, and; c) building project management and monitoring 
capacity.  Following the review, a 19-member working group representing all key ministries and the 
Central Bank was established for monitoring and accelerating the implementation of existing projects.  
The working group has met several times and is working to resolve implementation issues. Moreover, 
new lending has been slowed and supervision budgets augmented in order to direct more resources and 
time to resolving existing portfolio problems.  Finally, lessons from the reviews of supervision quality 
and disbursement issues are being applied to help improve portfolio performance and disbursements.  The 
country team analyzed the problems identified in the disbursement report and deve loped a list of key 
actions in response to each recommendation in the report.  These actions were reviewed with senior 
management and represent a concrete series of steps that are beginning to bear results.  In coming months 
other efforts to improve performance will be explored, including further project restructuring, or 
cancellation of persistently underperforming projects.   

75. 
The efforts of Government and the Bank are beginning to bear results.  All projects in the 
portfolio are now effective and implementation underway.  Disbursements rates have ticked up to about 
10 percent in FY10, mostly due to the signing of large contracts in the health, roads and judicial projects

that will further boost disbursements. Moreover, contracts now under preparation shou ld lead to a steady 
increase in disbursements in FY11 and a major jump in FY12.   

Analytical and Advisory Services 

76. 
The Analytical and Advisory services also had mixed results.  The Advisory services provided by 
IFC for Leasing, Corporate Governance, Supplier Finance, Housing Finance and Investment Climate 
reached a large client base, supported enactment of key legislative reforms, facilitated access to financing 
for client companies, and significantly reduced the cost of business registration for SMEs.  L ikewise, the 
recent CEM, and the FY09 Living Conditions Assessment report were well received and the 
programmatic poverty work helped to drive the reforms in pensions and social benefits. One notable 
output of the programmatic poverty work was detailed analysis of the TSA that was launched mid-2006. 
 A major dissemination workshop was held in Baku in April 2009. Given the prominence the program 
enjoys at highest level of the government, the workshop drew very senior government officials and 
parliamentarians, as well as other stakeholders inside and outside the government. Also, important was 
the High Level Policy Forum that has helped to stimulate a national debate on how to encourage 
economic diversification and growth of non-oil exports. On the other hand the programmatic PER and 
resources devoted to furthering structural reforms had limited impact as evidenced by the lack of progress 
in these areas.   Some formal outputs such as the PEFA and the CPAR were never published and other 
work was either delayed or dropped (Annex 2).  

Working with Government 

77. 
Relations with the Government were problematic throughout much of the CPS. On the positive 
side the Government sees the Bank as a reliable partner and the Government in particular appreciated the 
Bank‘s efforts to work with them in focusing on the rehabilitation of key infrastructure.   The Government 
also welcomed the Bank‘s rapid response to its request to expand lending in FY08 in support of its push 
to quickly improve infrastructural and social services.  More recently, the Government signaled its 
intention to work with the Bank to turn around portfolio performance and asked for Bank support with a 
capacity building project (FY09) aimed at improving implementation capacity. Moreover, the recently 
established working group on implementation is helping to resolve implementation issues. While relations 
were generally good, there were difficulties in working with the Government, particularly in the 
immediate aftermath to FY08.  Decisions on projects were often delayed and the decision making process 
was not very transparent.  This was particularly evident in the Railways Project where the Bank team 
thought they had a consensus on the size and composition of the railway investment program, only to find 
later that such a consensus did not exist.   

The Policy Dialogue  

78. 
The policy dialogue has been somewhat disappointing. The dialogue on structural reforms that in 
the previous CPS had been supported by a PRSC and a Development Policy Operation was to be carried 
out in the new CPS period through analytical and advisory work and implementation of sector operations.    
Moreover, the CPS indicated that reviews of core reforms would be carried each semester. Key to this 
was monitoring of progress on CPIA questions covering key reform areas. The outcome of this approach 
was mixed.  There was good progress in the social sectors with Bank operations supporting major reforms 
in education, health, and social protection.  The dramatic improvement in the Doing Business Survey al so 
underscored advances in corporate governance.  Results were less stellar in other areas with targets 
missed for public expenditure management, the business environment and the environment.   Reviews on 
progress with Government were not regular. The completion report for the earlier PRSC operation 
focused on structural reforms and was discussed with Government early in the CPS period and the 

81 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Progress report afforded another opportunity for review.   Recently, the successful CEM and high level 
policy forum supported by the Bank has put a renewed emphasis on policy discussions and follow-up 
activities are planned that will renew the dialogue on structural reforms and policies to stimulate 
diversification and growth of the non-oil economy.   

Working with other Partners  

79. 
The Bank worked closely with external partners throughout the CPS period. The CPS program 
was designed based on broad consultations with donors and development partners in Azerbaijan. 
Coordination worked well during implementation and was effective in avoiding duplicate or contradicting 
activities.  Coordination was provided through the Department for Coordination of Credits under State 
Guarantee, Technical Assistance and Grants, the Bank‘s key interlocutor at the Cabinet of Ministers, and 
through constant consultations with development partners. The most productive cooperation was 
established with USAID, the EU, ADB and SECO. The Bank and IMF also worked closely together 
throughout the CPS period on the macro-dialogue, though with limited success early in the CPS period 
when the Government had adopted a pro-cyclical fiscal policy. In the health sector the Bank worked 
closely with WHO, The Global Fund and USAID.  These partners complimented the Health Project 
activities in the form of strategy papers, training modules for family physicians, pharmaceuticals, and in 
reproductive health for primary health care.  UNDP and EU/TACIS contributed to strengthening of the 
social assistance system, supporting Social Protection and Social Assistance project. In infrastructure, 
Bank operations were coordinated with ADB, KfW, EBRD and IDB mainly in transport and water supply 
and sanitation. In the financial sector, the Bank worked with SECO, leveraging grant resources for 
supporting the Financial Services Development Project and for consumer protection and financial 
literacy. This cooperation with SECO was successful and will continue in the next CPS period.  

Management of Risks 

80. 
The Bank underestimated the portfolio management risk, and did not anticipate the problems with 
decision-making in Government.  The Bank has been proactive in addressing the problems that emerged 
in 2008, including augmenting staff in the country office, carrying out the joint portfolio review, 
postponing new lending and taking action on poor performing projects, including cancellation.  The 
agreement to establish a joint working group to oversee project implementation is also a positive step if it 
functions as intended.   It is hoped that these steps will mitigate the portfolio risk. 

Rating Bank Performance 

81. 
This CPSCR rates Bank performance as moderately unsatisfactory.  While the CPS was well 
aligned with the Government’s priorities, it delivered very mixed results.  The breadth of the CPS, 
stretching across a large number of sectors overwhelmed Azerbaijan’s modest implementation capacity.  
The decision to expand and accelerate lending in FY2008 while responsive to the Government’s wishes 
and in line with IBRD and IDA funding availability at the time, failed to anticipate the difficulties that 
would emerge in getting projects off the ground.  While the Bank underestimated this problem, it has been 
proactive in reducing new lending in FY09-10 and in working with Government in adopting mitigating 
measures that should speed implementation. Despite these difficulties the Bank’s relationship with 
Azerbaijan remains strong and there is a firm commitment by the Bank and the Government to address 
existing implementation problems so that most CPS outcomes are eventually achieved.  And the successes 
in the CPS in transit, rural investments, the social sectors, and in IFC’s activities provide a strong bases 
for moving forward into the next CPS period, albeit on a more modest scale than envisaged in FY2008.

IV. 

Lessons and Recommendations 

82. 
Selectivity – The CPS supported a large number of activities and investments across a broad 
range of sectors that led to difficulties in managing a diverse and fragmented portfolio.  Going forward, 
efforts to narrow the scope of Bank‘s activities and target areas where capacity is strongest could help 
ease implementation problems.  

83. 
Balance of Instruments – The policy dialogue had mixed results.   Competing priorities for both 
the Bank and the Government contributed to the poor results, but the lack of an effective anchor for the 
policy dialogue also was a contributing factor.   The measures identified to replace the PRSC series did 
not gain traction and the policy dialogue languished as a result.  For the new CPS, it may be useful to 
consider development policy lending in the mix of instruments. Greater emphasis on analytical work prior 
to lending would also help.  The high level policy forum also yielded promising results and could be a 
key in promoting a more fruitful policy dialogue. 

84. 
Project readiness.   The surge in lending in FY2008 led to instances where preparation could 
have been stronger, resulting in implementation delays.  A common problem was not full procurement 
readiness, and need for deeper capacity support to  implementing agencies, some of which were new to 
Bank operations.  To avoid future implementation delays, Bank management should  pay increased 
attention to preparation before taking projects to the Board,  to secure  projects‘ timely  implementation.  

85. 
Focusing More on Portfolio Implementation.  A clear lesson from the second half of the CPS 
period is the need to focus management and staff attention on portfolio implementation.  Adequate 
supervision resources, close attention to implementation and quick management and staff response to 
emerging problems are all required especially for a portfolio dominated by recently approved projects. 

86. 
Ensuring Adequate Project Monitoring and Evaluation.  Adequate arrangements for 
monitoring both key and intermediate indicators are key to measuring results and identifying problems 
that could affect project outcomes.  Careful attention to the arrangements for monitoring and evaluation is 
needed from the very beginning of project processing.  More generally, the potential for strengthening 
country systems to enhance monitoring and evaluation could be explored further.  

87. 
Being Realistic in Setting Outcome Indicators. Rather aggressive outcome indicators were put 
in the results matrix for many of the projects approved during the CPS period, particularly at the time o f 
the progress report when many of the indicators were revised. Even without the significant problems in 
getting the projects approved in FY08 underway, a number the outcome indicators for those projects 
would have been difficult to achieve by the end of the CPS period. As is common with many country 
programs, most outcomes recorded during the CPS period were in projects approved in the previous CPS. 

88. 
Understanding the Lending environment. Despite the Bank‘s best efforts, understanding the 
lending environment was an elusive goal and often the reasons for delays in implementation and 
effectiveness. It will be important to improve the Bank‘s understanding of the prevailing political 
economy to help identify potential problems with project implementation and al lowing for the 
development of mitigating measures.  

89. 
Establishing Clear Priorities. In instances like the environment projects, or the railway and 
water projects, all of which were identified by the Government as priorities, decisions were often delayed 
in a matter that was inconsistent with stated priorities.  It will be important going forward for the Bank to 
develop a clear understanding with the Government on how investment priorities are to be established and 
a consensus is to be achieved to ensure complete Government ownership. 

83 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
90. 
Deepening engagement in success areas. In some instances, such as the Second National Water 
and Sanitation Project, a follow-on project was approved before the original project had begun to yield 
results. In the future follow-up projects and additional financing should be prepared only after positive 
results of the original projects are confirmed.   

V.  Conclusions. 

91. 
The CPS period covered by this report produced very mixed results. Solid progress in achieving 
tangible outcomes in many areas of the Bank Group‘s assistance program contrasted with implementation 
problems for much of the portfolio and slow progress in structural reforms that in the end blunted the 
overall impact of the program.  The most successful projects in de livering results were mature projects 
carried over from the previous CPS, including the rural infrastructure, irrigation and agricultural 
development project, the first roads project and health projects.  Also follow-on projects such as in 
education and social protection, economic opportunities for IDPs and roads are beginning to yield results 
though they have not been fully immune to the delays in implementation.  Not all carry -over project have 
been successful, however, namely the Rural Environment Project which closed without achieving its 
Development objectives, and the Judicial Modernization Project, which spent much of the CPS period in 
unsatisfactory status and only now is beginning to be implemented.  Also problematic were projects 
begun in the CPS period such as the three Absheron environmental projects, the two water projects and 
railways project, where delays in signing and effectiveness and in implementation are adversely affecting 
project start up and impacting the delivery of results.  The Bank, working with Government, has been 
proactive in dealing with the portfolio problems with measures such as an increased staff field presence, 
conducting a joint portfolio review and developing follow-up measures, slowing delivery of new projects, 
withdrawing the two environmental clean-up projects and closing the Rural environment project.  The 
delivery of analytical and advisory services also had mixed results with the programmatic work on 
structural reforms and budget and expenditure management gaining little traction early in the CPS period 
and a number of other products being dropped or not published.  On the other hand, the recent CEM and 
the High Level Policy Forum have restored the momentum in the policy dialogue on structural reforms 
and solid analytical work on poverty and social protection have informed the Bank‘s successful assistance 
in these areas.  IFC also has delivered solid results both in its investment and advisory services.

Annex 3: Consultations on the CPS 

In July and early August 2010, separate CPS consultations were held in Baku with international donors, 
civil society representatives, and the business community. 

All stakeholders endorsed the main challenges facing Azerbaijan identified within the CPS, as well as, the 
proposed strategic objectives of the new CPS: (1) Building a Competitive Non-Oil Economy, and (2) 
Strengthening Social and Municipal Services.  It was agreed that while the strategy separates these two 
strategic objectives for presentational and accountability reasons, in fact they are strongly interlinked and 
success of the CPS will require simultaneous and comprehensive progress in both directions.  

Representatives of civil society and the business community particularly agreed with the emphasis the 
CPS puts on the cross-cutting ―governance filter‖.  They presented specific examples where – particularly 
in remote regions and for smaller entrepreneurs – lack of transparency and accountability on the part of 
authorities remains a significant obstacle to achieving economic and social results. At the same time, 
participants recognized that monitoring and measuring progress in improving governance – and taking 
practical follow-up measures - would be a challenge. From this perspective, the continuation of 
institutional capacity building initiated in a number of projects during the current CPS, and increasing the 
level and scope of analytical work proposed under the new CPS, are steps in the right direction. These 
measures must, however, be matched by a clear commitment on the part of government counterparts to 
address issues of governance and corruption as priority factors hindering the growth of the non -oil 
economy.  The government should accept in practice that further development of Azerbaijan will require 
more bottom-up initiatives by local communities and individual entrepreneurs.  

Discussants gave particular attention to the fact that limitations in economic competition and existing 
regulatory and bureaucratic obstacles weigh heavily on private businesses. These regulatory obstacles are 
amplified by shortages of professional advisory services and skills (legal, financial, marketing) and 
properly targeted state support, particularly to businesses organized by women and/or in remote regions.    

Participants fully endorsed the diagnosis in the CPS that the current low level of tertiary education 
(college and vocational) is a major structural deficiency in Azerbaijan, and will require decisive measures 
on the government side, and deep changes in social attitudes to the benefits of such education.  

Discussants agreed that new lending activities should be focused on sectors and institutions with stronger 
track records of successful implementation of World Bank projects. Simultaneously, it was understood 
that IFC could invest only in businesses with transparent ownership and financial reporting according to 
international standards. 

In conclusion, many discussants stated that the proposed CPS for FY11-14 is more strategic and realistic 
that the current one and that the proposed CPS made proper use of the lessons learned. Participants also 
expressed their desire and commitment to work closely with the WBG on implementation of the CPS.  A 
more efficient formula of such cooperation has to be elaborated.

Annex 4: Gender Issues in Azerbaijan 

Overview. Azerbaijan is a middle income country with uneven social and economic gender indicators. 
The main gender-related issues that negatively affect women are higher unemployment rates, the 
concentration of female employment in low paid sectors, and low representation in politics . Men are 
negatively affected by a lower life expectancy by 5 years. In addition, there are social and human rights 
problems such as gender based violence and human trafficking.  

Human development. Life expectancy at birth for women and men was 75 years and 70 years 
respectively in 2009. Primary school gross enrolment rates are 95% and 98%, secondary school gross 
enrolment rates are 81% and 85%, and tertiary school gross enrolment rates are 14% and 15% for girls 
and boys, respectively. Thus, for both males and females the issue in education is not a gender imbalance 
but the steep drop-off from secondary to tertiary enrolment. Health indicators for women are mixed. The 
estimated maternal mortality rate is 24 per 100,000 live births for 2009. Among the factors that contribute 
to the high rates of maternal mortality are high rates of anemia among women, high level of abortions, the 
poor health care infrastructure, especially in the rural areas, and the inadequate skills of service providers. 
Within the last five years, the number of live births among boys has risen considerably higher than that of 
girls (54 percent of boys vs. 46 percent of girls in 2009), likely attributable to sex-selective abortions.   

Labor market outcomes. The labor force participation rates for females and males are 67% and 78% 
respectively. The majority of employed women are employed in services (54%) and agriculture (37%) 
while employment in industry is negligible for women. Unemployment rates are 10% and 8% for women 
and men, respectively. An estimated 84% of all females employed are wage and salaried workers while an 
estimated 14% of all females employed are self-employed. The share of all employed women working in 
the public sector is estimated at 92% for 2006 compared to 55% of males. While no gender differences in 
pay for the same work are observed, female employment tends to be concentrated in lower paid sectors. 
Female employment dominates in education, health and social services. The total wage gap across all 
sectors is 56.8 percent (percentage of the average monthly salaries of women to average monthly salaries 
of men).  

Entrepreneurship. According to the Enterprise Survey in 2005, an average of 14% women participated 
in firm ownership. The share was highest in the case of medium firms (16%) and lowest in large firms 
with 4%. 

Political participation. The representation of women in Azerbaijan is low. Only 14 of the 125 members 
of the National Assembly are now women. There is only one woman out of total 45 MPs in the 
Parliament of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic. At the municipal level, the representation of 
women is even weaker.  The same pattern is found in the executive branch of government. In the Cabinet 
of Ministers, out of a total of 39 Ministers and Chairpersons of State Committees and Agencies, there is 
only one female member - the Chairperson of the State Committee on Family, Women, and Children‗s 
Affairs. At the level of Deputy Minister, only 6 percent are women.  

Legal issues. Azerbaijan ratified CEDAW without reservations and the Optional Protocol. The national 
legislation does not discriminate against women. The Law on Equal Rights and Opportunities was 
approved by Parliament in late 2006 in a process that spurred intense public discussion with broad 
participation of various stakeholders including a number of non-government and civil society 
organizations. In Azerbaijan, like in many other countries, there is a discrepancy between legislative acts 
and their realization.  

Violence and Trafficking. Although violence against women is considered a crime, enforcement is not 
particularly strong due to the lack of appropriate mechanisms. According to the 2008 US State 

88 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Department Report on Trafficking in Persons, Azerbaijan is a source and transit country for men, women, 
and children trafﬁcked for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor. Azerbaijan is 
placed on a Tier Two Watch List because it does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the 
elimination of trafﬁcking, though it is making signiﬁcant efforts to do so. Azerbaijan prepared and 
enforced the National Action Plan to Fight Human Trafficking in 2004 and the Law on Human 
Trafficking in August 2005.  

89 

 
 
 
 
Annex 5: Climate Change in Azerbaijan 

According to the 2009 Europe and Central Asia World Bank flagship report ―Managing Uncertainty: 
Adapting to Climate Change in Europe and Central Asia‖ – Azerbaijan is ranked 7th overall among ECA 
countries in terms of the impact-vulnerability index which measures the relative strength of future 
anticipated climate change relative to today‘s natural variability.10 

The main drivers of the vulnerability or impact index are: 

 First, its relative sensitivity to climate change (ranked 8th highest among the 28 ECA countries) 
owing to the age of energy sector infrastructure (the power sector is hard pressed to respond to 
the peaks in electricity demand linked to rising summer temperatures, and is badly in need of 
upgrade and expansion. Warmer summers, with periods of intense heat, have strained the 
transmission networks. In addition, extreme weather threatens the ability of networks to function 
as intended—especially aging and poorly maintained facilities); 

 Second, its relative exposure to climate change (Azerbaijan ranks 11th out of the 28 ECA 
countries) owing to the potential impact of catastrophic events (events that threaten an economic 
loss); 

 Thirdly, Azerbaijan has one of the most limited adaptive capacity to the effects of climate change 
of the ECA countries.  

Energy efficiency 

Reduced venting and flaring of gas in the oil and gas sector in Azerbaijan represents a major opportunity 
for more efficient use of energy resources. In 2006, according to estimates by the World Bank Global Gas 
Flaring Reduction public-private partnership, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan together flared 
and vented 7 billion cubic meters of associated gas. Technical and commercial gas transmission and 
distribution losses are also relatively high in Azerbaijan, presenting further opportunities for improving 
efficiency.  

On the electricity supply side, thermal power plant rehabilitation offers good potential for energy 
efficiency improvements. Technical and commercial losses of electricity have also been high. Azerbaijan 
has taken positive measures in this regard through tariff reform and re-metering and payment 
enforcement.  

Government Actions  

In 2000-2001 during the II Phase of ―First National Communication to the Conference of Parties‖ the 
following activities were done:  

 Estimation of Green Technologies requirements;  
 
Increasing of potential for participation in systematic global observation networks;  
 Leading of additional scientific researches on vulnerability and adaptation of fish resources and 
on the processes of desertification as result of climate change. 

10 The vulnerability index combines three sub‐ indices capturing a country‘s exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive 
capacity. The index combines the number of additional hot, dry and wet years; hot, dry and wet summers; and hot , 
dry and wet winters projected over the 2070–2100 period relative to the 1961–1990 period.

More recently, Azerbaijan adopted additional programs including: 

 Governmental program on using alternative and renewable sources of energy; 
 National program on regeneration and forestry development;  
 Sustainable Development program from ecological point of view; 
 Governmental program on hydrometeorology development.  

In terms of carbon finance, Azerbaijan has been involved in only a very limited way to date in the global 
carbon market There are at the moment five CDM projects under development in Azerbaijan (one fugitive 
emissions project, two supply side energy efficiency projects, one fuel switch project, and one hydro 
power project), and none of them have yet been registered by the UNFCCC as a CDM project . There are 
a number of opportunities to explore including thermal plant rehabilitation, heat supply, and to a more 
limited extent renewable energy. Small scale projects could be found in the rural/agriculture sector e.g. in 
the form of biogas installations and improved water supply and pumping.

Current status 

Prospects for achieving Goal by 2015  

Poverty levels have fallen from about 50 
percent in 2001 to about 16 percent in 
2008. 

Enrollment rates in basic education 
(grades 1-9) are well above 90 percent, 
although drop-out rates are higher for 
the poor than for nonpoor. Sector 
concerns relate more to quality, 
including the need to build the skills 
necessary in an increasingly global 
economy. 
Surveys show no significant gender 
differences in enrollment rates for basic 
education (grades 1-9). Concerns relate 
more to girls‘ access to upper secondary 
and higher education, particularly in 
rural areas.  

According to MOH data, under-five 
mortality rate declined from 23.1 per 
1,000 live births in 2001 to 16.1 in 
2007. WHO estimates also show a 
decline, from 46 in 2005 to 39 per 1,000 
live births in 2007. Despite these 
differences, the degree of decrease is 
similar, and continues a trend since 
1990, when the level was over 100. 
According to the State Statistical 
Committee (2009) and WHO, HFA DB 
2009, the MMR in 2008 was 26.3 deaths 
per 100,000 births compared with 37.6 
in 2000.  

According to MoH, clinically diagnosed 
AIDS incidence per 100,000 population 
has increased over the period from 0.1 
in 2001 to 0.7 in 2008. Part of the 
increase in the HIV prevalence is 
associated with improved case 
detection. Both, AIDS incidence and 
HIV prevalence rates in Azerbaijan 
favorably compare with corresponding 
average rates in CIS (2.2. per 100,000 
population)   

94 

Achieved. The oil sector boom, 
combined with broadening of 
employment-generating economic 
activities and targeted safety nets 
policies, has allowed Azerbaijan to 
achieve this target. 
Likely. The country inherited an 
education system that provides nearly 
universal basic education. Sector issues 
relate more to quality, than to access.  

Likely. Although girls drop out of 
secondary school earlier than boys and 
fewer attend post-secondary education, 
especially in rural areas, there is no 
evidence of gender inequality at the 
primary level.  Access to higher 
education is an issue for both genders. 
Likely.  Azerbaijan can meet this MDG 
by 2015, considering the positive trend 
to date.  The Government focuses on 
strengthening of primary healthcare 
services including access and quality of 
care as well as  improving reproductive 
health services in the frame of National 
Reproductive Health Strategy (2008-
20015) 
Possible.  There is a trend that shows 
decrease on MMR in the country, but it 
is still three times higher than the target 
MDG of 9.4 maternal deaths for 2015. 
The Government is strengthening 
primary health care with Bank support as 
part of the new National Reproductive 
Health Strategy (2008-20015).  
Possible. Given the nascent starting 
point, some rise was inevitable as more 
information and testing was available, 
and as Azerbaijan increased its trade 
links. 
 The MOH has an ongoing  
HIV/AIDS program supported by the 
Global Fund and is strengthening its 
institutional capacity for HIV/AIDS/STI 
control; and scaling up preventive 
interventions, particularly in vulnerable 
groups.  

 
 
 
 
Millennium 
Development 
Goal 
Reverse the 
spread of 
tuberculosis 

Ensure 
environmental 
sustainability 
(including 
halving the 
proportion of 
people without 
access to safe 
water) 

Current status 

Prospects for achieving Goal by 2015  

The prevalence of tuberculosis dropped 
over the period from 2001 to 2005 (from 
180.4 to 63.4 per 100,000 population), 
but since then has slowly increased, 
reaching 100.8 per 100,000 population 
in 2008.  In 2004, the National 
Tuberculosis Program (NTP) adopted 
full DOTS coverage to improve disease 
registration and control.  

According to available estimates, 
around 76 percent of all households 
have access to improved drinking water 
source – 93 percent in urban areas and 
58 percent in rural areas.  On other 
areas, the Government has recognized 
the importance of cleaning up 
environmental hazards of the FSU 
period, but has yet to take concrete steps 
in this regard. 

Possible.  Notwithstanding the recent 
rise in tuberculosis (which may stem in 
part to improved registration) 
tuberculosis treatment and success rate 
are improving. At the same time, a 
troubling trend is the rise of drug 
resistant TB among new cases.  TB 
control program efforts should be 
intensified and carefully monitored in 
order to achieve the Global TB Control 
Targets by year 2015. 
Possible to unlikely.  The Government, 
particularly with World Bank and ADB 
support, has launched a major effort to 
improve the access and quality of 
drinking water throughout Azerbaijan.  
However, this program has been slow to 
be implemented.  On cleaning up 
environmental legacy issues, increased 
Government commitment and focus will 
be needed.

Annex 8: One Bank – IFC and IDA/IBRD Integrated Programs 

The IFC and IDA/IBRD have continued to strengthen their integration in Azerbaijan, including through 
decentralization of staff to the field.  Particular areas of integration and coordination expected to have a 
high pay-off during the CPS period include: 

 The Financial Sector:   IFC will continue to support the growth and consolidation of the banking 
sector and the provision of finance for SMEs and microenterprises through financial intermediaries.  
IDA/IBRD will complement this through supporting the development of the capital markets through 
the proposed Capital Markets Modernization Project.   IFC and the Bank will support these efforts 
through coordinated analytic work including IDA/IBRD regular financial sector assessments and 
policy dialogues with the Central Bank and IFC advisory work on key issues for banks, such as credit 
information sharing, real estate appraisal, and the management of non-performing loans. IFC will 
work to identify potential areas for advisory on capital markets development, as per the Government's 
request. 

 The Business Environment:   IFC will continue to promote the implementation of improvements in 
processes for permits and inspections, with the possible addition of additional areas such as the ease 
of paying taxes and trading across borders.  The Bank will complement these efforts with analytic 
work on trade and supporting a regular High Level Policy Forum to help the Government develop 
ways of further strengthening exports and competitiveness.  Improvements will be measured through 
various surveys including BEEPs, Doing Business and a possible follow-up IFC SME Survey.   

 Corporate Governance:  The Bank and IFC will continue to cooperate closely particularly through the 
Bank's ongoing Corporate and Public Accounting Project, and a possible new ROSC on accounting 
and auditing, and the IFC completing a comprehensive advisory project on corporate governance in 
the private sector.   

 Agriculture:  IDA/IBRD will support the further development of the agriculture sector through a new 
agriculture development and credit project, as well as an agriculture review and analytic work on 
trade issues related to agriculture such as quality standards.  IFC will complement this by considering 
financing agribusiness both directly and through financial institutions.  It may also consider launching 
advisory services to improve competitiveness, including on issues such as food safety and 
agrifinance.
