I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

1. 
As the second largest economy in West Africa, a top world exporter of cocoa and 
cashews, and with an important manufacturing sector, Côte d’Ivoire boasts enormous 
economic potential. However, years of political and military crisis and poor governance have taken 
a heavy toll on the country, transforming the once-model African nation into a fragile state. Today, 
poverty is at an all time high, having increased from 10 percent in 1985 to 49 percent in 2008. The 
state faces major demands to rebuild social services and physical infrastructure.  

2. 
The signing of the Ouagadougou Political Accord (OPA) and the establishment of a 
coalition transitional government in 2007 were a turning point for the country. The Government 
committed itself to demobilize, disarm, and reintegrate former combatants; hold presidential 
elections and ensure they are free, fair and secure; unify the armed forces into one national military 
and redeploy the public administration in the Center-North-West (CNW), including restoring basic 
services disrupted during the conflict. The Government has made some progress in these efforts, 
including carrying out a national identification program as part of election preparations and 
redeploying public services throughout the country to reverse the deterioration in basic services. 
Elections are expected to be held in 2010 after having been delayed several times since 2005. 

3. 
The country’s economic rebound and recovery have been dampened by the effect of the 
global recession and delayed elections which have stalled new investments. Real GDP growth is 
projected to fall from 3.7 percent in 2009 to 3.0 percent in 2010, before rebounding to average 4.8 
percent over the period 2011-14, as the global economic slowdown ends, the political environment 
improves, and productivity and investment return to their pre-crisis growth path. 

4. 
The Government adopted its first Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) in January 
2009 and reached the HIPC Decision Point in March 2009. The country has begun benefitting 
from modest Interim HIPC Debt Relief while it implements the PRSP and other reforms to reach 
HIPC Completion Point.  This World Bank Group Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY10-13 
outlines a program to support the implementation of the PRSP.  

5. 
During the CPS period, the Bank Group’s strategy is to promote short-term visible 
results to improve quality of life, boost economic activity, and support stabilization; while 
continuing to support long-term reforms to help achieve sustainable peace and growth and 
make progress toward the MDGs.  The Bank Group’s program in Côte d’Ivoire will include a mix 
of AAA, IDA investment and budget support operations, and Trust Fund grants to support four 
strategic objectives, or Pillars: 1) Strengthening governance and institutions; 2) Improving the 
performance of agriculture; 3) Strengthening the private sector; and 4) Renewing infrastructure and 
basic services. Job creation, with a particular focus on youth, and mainstreaming gender and 
improving women’s economic opportunities, are cross cutting objectives. IDA development policy 
operations (DPOs) will support reforms that help to underpin IDA investments. For example, under 
Pillars 1 and 2, a DPO series, analytical work and investments jointly support a comprehensive 
program to strengthen governance and productivity and reduce poverty in the cocoa sector. 

6. 
IFC and MIGA have also reengaged in Côte d’Ivoire and will contribute to CPS 
objectives. IFC is anchoring its reengagement strategy around agribusiness and infrastructure, and 

i 

 
 
 
 
 
 
will also seek to develop projects in the financial sector, services to SMEs, investment climate and 
social services.  MIGA is planning to underwrite investments in the transport and energy sectors. 

7. 
Côte d’Ivoire will continue to benefit from exceptional post-conflict IDA allocations 
during the CPS period, FY10-FY13, which overlaps IDA15 and IDA16 replenishment periods. 
Indicative IDA allocations would total SDR 277 million. Indicative allocations for the rest of IDA15 
would comprise a firm allocation of SDR 91.5 million in FY10 and an indicative allocation of SDR 
45.6 million in FY11.  As the exceptional post-conflict IDA allocations begins to decline gradually in 
FY12, indicative allocations during FY12-FY13 are estimated at about SDR 70 million per annum.  
SDR 19.2 (US$30) million has also been approved for Côte d’Ivoire from stage 1 of the Crisis 
Response Window (CRW) to help mitigate the social and fiscal impact of the global economic crisis, 
including covering reconstruction programs and ensuring the delivery of basic infrastructure services 
for the hardest hit communities. 

8. 
The CPS has been prepared in coordination with the Government, non-government 
actors, and the main development partners in Côte d’Ivoire, notably the International 
Monetary Fund, the European Union, the United Nations and the African Development Bank. 
Under the CPS, the Bank will seek to improve aid effectiveness by strengthening country fiduciary 
systems and continuing coordination with partners as they fully reengage. The Bank held national 
consultations with central and local government and non-government representatives in Abidjan 
(with representatives from the south region), in Daloa (with representatives from the western region) 
and Bouaké (with representatives from the northern region) between July 2009 and February 2010. 
Consultations were organized in close coordination with Côte d’Ivoire’s Ministry of State, Planning 
and Development, the Ministry of Economy and Finance, and the PRSP Permanent Secretariat. 

9. 
Given the fragile country environment and the medium-term horizon of this strategy, 
the Bank will prepare a note for the Board on CPS implementation progress either following 
elections or after one year of implementation. Such a note would update the Board on status of the 
Bank program, prospects for continued implementation of the CPS, and make any recommendations 
for adjusting the Bank’s approach if needed. 

10. 
The CPS considers a number of risks and options for mitigating their impact on the 
strategy. Based on the pace of implementing the OPA since 2007, progress on reunification is likely 
to remain slow leading up to presidential elections. The main political party leaders have pledged to 
form a coalition government should they be elected president and this power-sharing arrangement 
should help mitigate the potential for significant disruption based on election results.  The risks for 
Côte d’Ivoire are also significant if government does not stay on track with its macroeconomic 
program and governance reforms, which would delay HIPC Completion Point, the reengagement of 
other development partners offering significant levels of financing, the return of private sector 
investors to the country, and economic recovery in general. The Bank will continue to work closely 
with the authorities and development partners toward successful implementation of the OPA and 
reform program to mitigate these risks. Meanwhile, the global economic recession could further 
dampen foreign direct investment. 
 Government’s recent track record in macroeconomic 
management, the focus on growth enhancing structural reforms and support provided by donors, and 
its commitment to a rapid attainment of the HIPC Completion Point and to adjust the macroeconomic 
program will help mitigate the impact of exogenous shocks.

II. INTRODUCTION 

1.      Côte d’Ivoire began the slow process of emerging from a national crisis in 2007 with the 
signing of the Ouagadougou Political Accord (OPA) and the establishment of a coalition 
transitional government. These events paved the way for the 2008 reengagement of the Bank, 
which had suspended its IDA disbursements in 2004 due to arrears. 

2.      A two-year Interim Strategy Note (ISN) was discussed by the Executive Directors on 
April 1, 2008 outlining a framework for the Bank’s phased reengagement in Côte d’Ivoire 
during Bank fiscal years 2008 and 2009. The strategy focused on three strategic objectives: 
i) Helping government stabilize the country and address key conflict factors; ii) Assisting war-
affected populations; and iii) Supporting economic recovery and reform. During the ISN period, the 
Government prepared the country’s first Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). 

3.      This World Bank Group Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY10-13 outlines a 
program to build on the ISN and support implementation of the PRSP. The CPS emphasizes a 
gradual shift from post-conflict recovery to restoring and maintaining sustainable economic growth 
and poverty reduction. During the CPS period, the Bank Group will seek to help improve quality of 
life, boost economic activity, and support stabilization in the short-term; while continuing to assist 
Côte d’Ivoire in laying the groundwork for long-term reforms to help achieve sustainable peace and 
growth and make progress toward the MDGs. 

III. COUNTRY CONTEXT 

A. Socioeconomic and Historical Context 

4.      Côte d’Ivoire is a medium-size country located on the coast of West Africa and 
bordering five countries: Liberia, Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso and Ghana. The country’s southeast, 
where the administrative and commercial capital Abidjan is located, supports a wide variety of 
smallholder and plantation agriculture; the southwest, is dominated by the timber industry and cocoa-
coffee farming; and the northern savannah region is where cotton and cashews are produced. 
Although the majority of the active population is involved in agriculture, the country has also been 
rapidly urbanized, with almost half of the population of 20 million concentrated in two cities, 
Abidjan and Bouaké. 

5.      The population is made up of some 60 distinct ethnic communities which are grouped 
into five main socio-linguistic groups: Akan, Voltaic or Gur, Kru, Northern Mandé and Southern 
Mandé. The Akan is the largest ethnic group, comprising around 40 percent of the population, and 
found in eastern and central regions; the northern groups are the Northern Mandé and Voltaic, 
comprising about 34 percent of the population. As the Ivorian economy has developed, it has also 
produced major demographic changes, including pulling in significant populations from Francophone 
countries—notably Burkina Faso, Guinea and Mali—as well as Ivorians living in the north, 
particularly towards the rich agricultural areas in the south. Islam is the predominant religion in the 

1 

 
north, Christianity in the south and center, and indigenous beliefs are practiced throughout the 
country. 

6.      For 20 years after independence in 1960, Côte d’Ivoire was seen as the model African 
state. The country enjoyed a stable government and its strong economic performance was considered 
a “miracle,” with growth rates averaging 7 percent. Growth was driven by booming cocoa and coffee 
production, made possible by a liberal immigration policy and strong international demand, enriching 
agribusinesses and creating important revenues for small farmers and generous fiscal space for 
Government to make important investments in human development and in infrastructure.  

7.      The miracle began unraveling when agricultural commodity prices plummeted in the 
late 1970s. As revenues dropped, the government borrowed heavily to maintain and expand 
investments. Inflation increased and the country was soon faced with a national debt crisis and an 
overvalued currency making Côte d’Ivoire’s industries less competitive. The 1980s saw the economy 
slide into stagnation followed by a recession, with tensions emerging over immigration issues, 
struggles over land, and rising unemployment.  The Government moved to implement structural 
adjustment programs supported by the IMF and World Bank but these had little effect in the face of 
declining terms of trade for cocoa and coffee, an overvalued exchange rate, and emerging corruption 
issues. Poverty grew rapidly, from 10 percent to 37 percent between 1985 and 1993. By this time, 
devaluating the currency seemed the only solution to the crisis. 

8.      
In early 1994, the CFAF (the West African Franc used in 14 countries) was devalued by 
50 percent and, accompanied by other reforms and support from the international community, 
leading to a 6 percent growth rate over the next two years.  Poverty declined to 32 percent by 
1998. However, exports were competing in a new international environment marked by a global 
surplus of commodities and the recovery lasted only a few years.  

9.      On the political front, the country began a difficult transition from autocracy to multi-
party democracy following the death of President Houphouet-Boigny in December 1993.  Under 
his successors, the effects of deteriorating governance, growing unemployment and a progressive 
degradation of human capital and physical infrastructure began emerging.  The struggling economy 
saw a rise in anti-immigrant sentiments as tensions increased over land ownership and politicians 
exploited issues of national identity for political gain.  The concept of “Ivoirité,” once a notion of 
national pride, became a means to exclude and discriminate against immigrants and created tensions 
between the north and south. Public dissatisfaction led to the 1999 military coup against then-
President Henri Konan Bédié. General Robert Guéï took control and organized presidential election 
in 2000 from which all opposition parties were barred from participating except the Ivorian Popular 
Front (FPI). Alassane Ouattara, a key presidential contender from the north, was excluded from the 
vote based on a 1999 law requiring both parents of a presidential candidate to be born in Côte 
d’Ivoire. Laurent Gbagbo of the FPI won the election and took office in October 2000. 

10.      Issues of national identity and discrimination against northerners became the catalyst 
for the attempted coup and brief armed conflict launched in September 2002 by the New 
Forces (FN), a group composed of aggrieved serving and retired soldiers led by a former student 
activist named Guillaume Soro.  Although the coup failed, the country became divided in two, with 
the Government retaining control of the south and the FN taking over the North and other regions in 
the West.  The actual conflict was brief but was followed by episodes of unrest and violence into late 
2004, the interruption of basic services in the CNW and an exodus of civil servants and others fleeing 

2 

 
to the south. France and the UN sent troops to establish a buffer zone between the two sides. A 
stalemate ensued between 2003 and 2007 referred to as “neither war nor peace.” 

11.      The crisis further weakened institutions and governance.  The government shifted scarce 
fiscal resources away from basic services to military purposes, donor support dried up or was 
suspended and domestic and external arrears mounted. Capital flight rose substantially and private 
investment stalled. Governance deteriorated and corruption flourished as individuals took advantage 
of lawlessness and a dysfunctional judiciary. Roadblocks and racketeering 1
 by armed groups further 
depressed trade and commerce.  Transparency International gives Côte d’Ivoire a Corruption 
Perception Index of 2 out of 10 (0 being perceived as highly corrupt and 10 being perceived as highly 
clean) in 2009, compared to an already low score of 3 in 1998. 

12.      The conflict also had an important regional dimension.  Côte d’Ivoire remains the largest 
economy in West Africa after Nigeria, accounting for over 35 percent of the GNI of the WAEMU 
(Table 1) and its situation has a significant bearing on the prospects of the sub-region. Prior to the 
crisis, it had been an important source of jobs and remittances for neighboring countries as well as a 
major transport hub. Trade and transport were disrupted and traffic that had once flowed through the 
port of Abidjan was diverted to outlets in Ghana, Togo and Benin. Smuggling activities increased 
significantly. 

13.      The signing of the OPA in 2007 was a turning point for the country. Prior to that, 
mediation efforts since 2003 had failed to help the country make sufficient progress toward 
reunification and peace. The relative success of the OPA is credited to the fact that it was negotiated 
directly by President Laurent Gbagbo and FN leader Guillaume Soro and facilitated by President 
Blaise Compaoré of Burkina Faso. As part of the agreement, a coalition transitional government 
headed by President Gbagbo and Prime Minister Soro was established to, inter alia, organize free 
and fair elections, unify the armed forces into one national military, and reunify the country under 
one public administration.

checkpoints manned by police and military personnel. Many of these checkpoints were set up to control traffic 
during the conflict.

B. Poverty and the Millennium Development Goals 

14.      Poverty rates have steadily increased since 1985.  Poverty was reduced from about 38 
percent to 32 percent as a result of the brief economic recovery of the mid-1990s. However, the 
poverty rate began to climb after 1998 back up to 38 percent by 2003.  A household living standard 
survey (HLSS) in 2008 revealed that absolute poverty had further increased to a rate of 49 percent. 
According to these data, between 1985 and 2008, the poverty rate has gone from 10 percent to nearly 
50 percent. 2

15.      Poverty has increased most dramatically in rural areas and in the CNW zone, 
underscoring issues of geographic inequality.  Although agriculture has for years accounted for 
about 25 percent of GDP and 40 percent of exports, rural poverty has grown steadily, from 49 
percent in 2002 to 63 percent in 2008. The regions with the highest incidence of poverty are the 
North—where poverty has nearly doubled during the crisis, from 40 percent to 77 percent—followed 
by the West, the Center-West and the North-West. By comparison, poverty in Abidjan is estimated at 
21 percent. 

16.      The status of women lags behind that of men, although there have been some 
improvements with regard to education opportunities and progress toward some MDGs. That 
said, women are more likely than men to be unemployed or underemployed. They make up 90 
percent of the agricultural labor force, notably present in food production, which is less lucrative than 
cash crops such as cocoa. And women have been most impacted by the conflict and crisis, making up 
52 percent of Internally Displaced People (IDPs). Progress toward the MDGs will have the greatest 
impact on women. (See also Box 2 on Gender Parity). 

17.      Côte d’Ivoire is behind schedule to reach most of the MDGs. Gender parity in school, 
halting the spread of HIV/AIDS and access to an improved source of water are three MDGs that 
could be attained by 2015. Otherwise, nearly all social development indicators have stagnated or 
deteriorated.  The impact is reflected in a high child mortality rate of 127 deaths per 1,000 children, 
though this has improved from the rate of 151/1,000 in 1990; and one of the highest maternal 
mortality rates in the region, with 543 mothers dying for 100,000 births. This rate is an improvement 
over the 1995 estimated rate of 1,200 deaths per 100,000 births. However, the MDG of 300/100,000 
is unlikely to be achieved by 2015 3
. The immunization rate has been declining since 2006 and polio 
has reemerged. The primary education completion rate has been around 47 percent since 1985 and 
illiteracy rates are high. 

18.      The Human Development Index (HDI) for Côte d’Ivoire declined after 1985 and since 
1995 has stagnated at a very low level.  Côte d’Ivoire’s HDI
 ranking was 166 in 2008, compared 
to 161 in 2001 and 145 in 1995.  This HDI is considerably lower than what could be expected on the 
basis of the per capita income.

2 Strategy for Relaunching Development and Reducing Poverty, January 2009, Government of Côte d’Ivoire; data 
from the draft World Bank Poverty Assessment 2010 reveals that a higher poverty line threshold (about $1.50 rather 
than $1.25 or less previously) in part accounts for the high level to which poverty is estimated to have increased.

Box 1 presents the status of progress towards ten MDGs. 

Box 1: Côte d’Ivoire’s Prospects for Achieving the MDGs  

Objective 1: Reduce Absolute Poverty and Famine. 
Goal 1: Reduce by half the proportion of people living below the national poverty line.  The national poverty 
headcount increased from 37 percent in 1993 to 49 percent in 2008. Reaching the MDG of 12 percent poverty by 
2015 is highly unlikely.  
Goal 2: Reduce by half the proportion of population suffering from hunger. Child malnutrition is estimated at 21 
percent in 2008, with an MDG target of 10 percent.  Reaching the MDG is unlikely. 
Objective 2: Provide Primary Education to All. 
Goal 3: Provide all children with the means to complete a full cycle of primary education. The gross enrolment 
rate is estimated at 77 percent and the completion rate at 51 percent in 2007. Reaching the MDG is unlikely. 
Objective 3: Promote Gender Equality and Empower Women. 
Goal 4:  Eliminate gender disparity at all levels of education by 2015. Gender inequality persists as reflect by the 
lower rates of girls gross enrollment in primary school (70 percent) and secondary school (24 percent) as compared 
to boys (84 percent and 41 percent, respectively). Achieving gender parity in education is possible. 
Objective 4: Reduce Mortality of Infants Under Five Years. 
Goal 5: Reduce by two-thirds the mortality rates in infants under five. Child mortality is estimated at 127 deaths 
per 1,000 children in 2008, compared to 151/1,000 in 1990. Reaching the MDG of 50/1,000 is unlikely. 
Objective 5: Improve Maternal Health. 
Goal 6: Reduce by two-thirds the rate of maternal mortality.  Maternal mortality remains one of the highest in the 
region, with 543 deaths per 100,000 births in 2008. The MDG of reducing it to 300 deaths per 100,000 by 2015 is 
unlikely. 

Objective 6: Combat HIV/AIDS, Malaria and Other Diseases. 
Goals 7 and 8: Stop the spread of HIV/AIDS and begin to reverse the trend; and bring malaria and other diseases 
under control and begin to reverse the trend.  The rate of infection of HIV/AIDS is 4.7 percent and reaching the 
MDG of 1.8 percent is unlikely; malaria incidence is 146/1,000 and the goal is to reduce it to 110/1,000. Reaching 
the MDG is possible. 

Objective 7: Ensure a Sustainable Environment. 
Goal 9: Integrate the principles of sustainable development in national policies and reverse the trend of 
degrading environmental resources. The proportion of protected zones for preservation of biodiversity is 10 percent 
and the MDG goal is to increase it to 20 percent. This is unlikely to be achieved. 
Goal 10: Reduce by half the percentage of population without access to clean water and basic sanitation.  The 
percent of the population with access to an improved water source is 81 percent and reaching the MDG of 83 
percent is likely. 

C. Recent Political Developments 

19.      In preparation for presidential elections, a national identification and voter registration 
program was completed in November 2009.  Some 6.3 million potential voters were identified, of 
which 5.3 million were confirmed to be eligible to vote and the status of another 1 million needed to 
be confirmed or clarified through an appeals process.   

5 

 
 
 
20.      Elections have been delayed repeatedly since 2005. Arrangements were nearly finalized for 
elections to be held in March 2010 when a political crisis stalled the process in February 2010. The 
events involved the President’s dissolution of the Government and the Independent Electoral 
Commission (CEI) on charges of vote tampering.  Discussions facilitated by President Compaoré led to 
agreement with the opposition on a new CEI and the formation of a new coalition Government 
including 16 members of the ruling party and 11 from the main opposition. The new CEI is proceeding 
with the appeals process to finalize the voter list and once completed, the list will be published and 
campaigning can officially begin. 

21.      The key financial and technical donors supporting the electoral process are the 
European Union and the United Nations.  There is a Joint International Observer Mission 
composed of the African Union, the EU, the Economic Community of West African States 
(ECOWAS), the International Organization of the Francophonie, the National Democratic Institute, 
the Electoral Institute of Southern Africa, the Carter Center and the Embassy of Japan. The UN has 
pledged to provide an additional 250 troops to help secure elections. 

D. Recent Economic Developments 

22.      As the political situation began improving in 2007, the economy registered a modest 
recovery. The economy grew by 2.3 percent in 2008, driven by construction, food production, and 
telecommunications. GDP growth is estimated to have reached 3.7 percent in 2009, bolstered by 
continued post-crisis recovery activities, consolidation of the peace process, progress toward 
elections, and restored investor confidence. 

23.      Fiscal performance in 2008 was mixed. Government efforts focused on improving revenue 
collection, repaying external arrears, and keeping overall spending in check. The Government made a 
significant contribution to help clear arrears to the World Bank, while a small surplus was recorded 
in the primary fiscal balance and social spending met targets. However, post-conflict spending 
proceeded slowly, domestic arrears remained large, and extra budgetary expenditures for large public 
works not related to crisis recovery temporarily delayed the start of an IMF-supported Extended 
Credit Facility (ECF) 5
 until corrective measures were taken. 

24.      Macroeconomic management improved in 2009. The approval of the IMF ECF in March 
2009 paved the way for Côte d’Ivoire to reach the HIPC Decision Point. The first review in 
September 2009 confirmed that the program remained on track. The authorities also approved the 
country’s first PRSP in early 2009. As promised in this strategy and as agreed under the IMF 
program, the government limited spending on large public works and shifted more budget resources 
to teachers and health workers as well as crisis-related expenditures, including for presidential 
elections.  

25.      The fiscal situation deteriorated after September 2009 due to lower than expected 
customs revenues and higher spending (electricity subsidies and sovereignty expenditures). However, 
corrective actions were taken to improve revenue collection and control expenditures and the fiscal 
position at end-2009 remained sound.  On the other hand, an electricity crisis in early 2010 will result 
in growing electricity subsidies projected to reach CFAF 68 billion in 2010 (about $150 million). The 

5formerly called a Poverty Reduction Growth Facility (PRGF).

financing gap for 2010 is estimated at over US$800 million under conservative spending 
assumptions. The gap is being closed with resources from the World Bank, IMF, AfDB and 
European Union, and by the restructuring of bilateral and commercial debt.  

E. Medium-term Prospects 

26.      The medium-term macroeconomic outlook is based on the assumption of a steady post-
conflict recovery.  Real GDP growth is projected to fall to 3.0 percent in 2010, before rebounding to 
average 4.8 percent over the period 2011-14, as the global economic slowdown ends, the political 
environment improves, and productivity and investment return to their pre-crisis growth path.  
Growth during the recovery phase would come from renewed private sector confidence and 
investments, the return of capacity utilization in industry to normal levels, normalization of the 
situation in the central, northern and western parts of the country, the rehabilitation of public 
infrastructure, and expected reforms in the cocoa, energy and financial sectors.  Rehabilitation of 
public infrastructure (especially roads to the North) will be particularly critical to help domestic and 
external trade and re-launch nontraditional exports and agricultural processing industries.  Restoring 
the capacity of the electricity sector will also be critical for the country’s economic recovery.  
Longer-term growth would be sustained by diversification of the economy, increased investment, and 
expanded trade to regional and global markets.  CPI inflation is expected to remain at 2.5-3 percent 
during 2010-2014. To achieve sustainable growth over the long term, Côte d’Ivoire will need to rein 
in corruption, further diversify its economy, increase pro-poor investments in human capital, 
strengthen institutional capacity to maintain infrastructure, and expand trade to regional and global 
markets. 

27.      The trade balance is expected to remain positive but decrease and turn negative in the 
next few years.  Export and import volumes are projected to grow at similar rates but the terms of 
trade are expected to deteriorate after 2009.  Cocoa sales will likely decline in the medium term due 
to aging plantations and declining prices.  Oil exports will gradually expand but so will imports, such 
that Côte d’Ivoire will remain only a small net exporter. With significant outflows for service 
payments and private transfers, the current account balance is therefore expected to turn negative. 

28.      The 2010 budget emphasizes pro-poor spending 
together with post-conflict 
expenditures (disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, redeployment of the administration, 
elections and reunification). Pro-poor spending is planned to increase from 34 percent of the national 
budget in 2009 to 37.7 percent in 2010.  Whereas total spending (excluding debt service) will 
increase by only 6 percent, spending on health and education is planned to rise by 10 percent and 
13.4 percent, respectively. The authorities plan to gradually reduce the wage bill to 38 percent of tax 
revenues by 2014, thereby approaching the WAEMU target of 35 percent.   

29.      In the medium-term, the Government plans continued primary basic surpluses above 
1 percent of GDP, which would help it to remain current on debt service. Fiscal space for pro-poor 
spending should come from a modest increase in the revenue/GDP ratio, containing the wage bill in 
line with the WAEMU criterion, reducing sovereignty and other non-essential spending, and an 
increase in concessional project financing. Total revenues (excluding grants) are projected to reach 

7 

 
 
21 percent of GDP in 2015. Government expenditures are projected to increase to 26.3 percent of 
GDP in 2015, due primarily to a recovery of public investment to 6.7 percent of GDP (from 3 percent 
in 2008). This will be funded fairly equally from domestic and foreign sources.  External grants, 
mainly for projects, are expected to average 1.2 percent of GDP over the period. See Table 2.

F. Debt Management 

30.      Côte d’Ivoire has cleared outstanding arrears with multilateral creditors or reached an 
agreement to clear them. HIPC Initiative debt relief is estimated at US$3 billion in end-2007 NPV 
terms.  Côte d’Ivoire has already received about 55 percent of its estimated HIPC debt relief 
including pre-2002 excess debt relief provided by the Paris Club and London Club creditors, and 
concessional arrears-clearance operations undertaken by IDA and the AfDB.  In May 2009, the 
Government reached an agreement with the Paris Club to reduce debt service to bilateral donors by 
92 percent (US$4.3 billion) during the ECF period. In September 2009 it also signed a preliminary 
agreement with the London Club which is consistent with the IMF’s and Bank’s initiative for HIPC. 
Under this agreement, Côte d’Ivoire will invite holders of Brady bonds to exchange such bonds for a 
new U.S. dollar denominated bond 6
. Upon reaching the HIPC Completion Point, Côte d’Ivoire will 
qualify for relief under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), which will reduce debt service 
to IDA, the IMF, and the AfDB by just over US$2 billion (in nominal terms). Côte d’Ivoire would 
also receive debt relief from bilateral creditors. 

6The new bond has a term of 23 years and six-year grace period. The exchange will occur no later than March 31, 
2010.  

8 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                   
31.      The Government also needs to settle large amounts of domestic arrears with private 
creditors and vendors. Using the proceeds of Bank budget support and the IMF ECF approved in 
March 2009, the authorities have started implementing a domestic arrears clearance plan for 2009-13 
to gradually eliminate the stock of overdue payments to the private sector which stood at 2.7% of 
GDP at end 2008. By October 2009, domestic arrears clearance was ahead of schedule. 

32.      Nonetheless, the Debt Sustainability Analysis conducted for the HIPC Decision Point 
document shows that Côte d’Ivoire is still at a high risk of debt distress (Annex 5).  External debt 
service is averaging 3.6 percent of GDP in 2009-2011 and is projected to rise temporarily to 5.2 
percent of GDP after the HIPC Completion Point is reached. Significant relief was obtained from the 
Paris Club of official creditors in May 2009 and a preliminary agreement was reached with the 
London Club in September 2009 to restructure commercial debt.  Support from multilateral agencies 
will help meet the financing gap but the authorities will need to maintain a fiscal surplus and higher 
economic growth to remain current on external and domestic debt service.  

IV. NATIONAL PRIORITIES, CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES 

33.      In 2008, the Government launched the preparation of a Strategy for Re-launching 
Development and Reducing Poverty, Côte d’Ivoire’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP).  
Extensive consultations were held in March and April 2008 across the country. Eleven regional 
consultation committees were created, each incorporating local government officials, religious and 
traditional leaders, associations of women and youth, civil society, security forces, farmers, private 
sector operators, and development partners. 

34.      The final strategy document was validated in a national workshop on January 5, 2009 
and approved by the Cabinet in February 2009.  From June through September 2009, the Ministry 
of State, Planning and Development organized additional sector-specific workshops to prepare 
priority action plans for the implementation of the PRSP. A priority action matrix was shared with 
development partners in February 2010. 

Country Vision and PRSP Objectives  

35.      The PRSP covers the seven-year period from 2009-2015, with a mid-term review 
planned in 2013.  It calls for an ambitious program to consolidate peace and transform Côte d’Ivoire 
into an emerging economy in which poverty falls from the current 49 percent to 33 percent by 2013 
and to 16 percent by 2015, supported by average annual GDP growth of approximately 6 percent. 

36.      Strategic Outcome 1: Reestablishing the Foundations of the Republic — This pillar 
focuses on consolidating peace and security and promoting good governance.  The Government will 
consolidate peace through the implementation of the OPA, notably to complete the DDR program, 
create a unified army, restore control over the entire country and hold presidential elections. The 
government will support good governance by modernizing the public administration and improving 
public services, including justice services and the penal system.  

37.      Strategic Outcome 2: Transforming Côte d’Ivoire into an Emerging Economy — The 
Government will maintain a stable macroeconomic framework by improving fiscal and tax policies 
and deepening structural reforms in key economic sectors including cocoa-coffee, energy and oil. 

9 

 
The government will also strengthen public financial management and procurement reforms to 
improve the efficiency, effectiveness and transparency in the use of public resources. The 
government will invest in transport given its fundamental importance to economic activities and 
regional integration. The government will also seek to create more jobs and wealth by creating a 
more enabling environment for the private sector; investing in improvements in agricultural 
productivity and food self-sufficiency throughout the country; promoting trade, income-generating 
activities and self-employment; creating incentives for labor-intensive employment opportunities and 
strengthening professional and vocational educational opportunities. 

38.      Strategic Outcome 3: Social Well-Being For All — Under this pillar, the Government will 
invest in basic education and health services to make progress toward the MDGs, improve access to 
basic infrastructure such as potable water, adequate sanitation and energy services, and establish a 
decent urban and rural environment.  The Government will also strengthen social protection, 
including helping reintegrate IDPs, promote the status of women and protect the environment, 
including by mainstreaming forestry issues in rural development activities. 

39.      Strategic Outcome 4: Côte d’Ivoire is a Dynamic Actor on the Regional and 
International Scene — The objective of this pillar is to restore regional ties and cooperation with 
the international community by consolidating peace and national stability; by adhering to WAEMU 
convergence criteria, including maintaining inflation at 3 percent or lower; by improving exports and 
investing in regional infrastructure; and by normalizing financial relations with external partners. 

40.      The Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) prepared by the World Bank and IMF on the 
PRSP urged an immediate and focused effort to reverse the rising trend in poverty. The JSAN 
called for additional research on the underlying causes of the rise in poverty and noted that 
accelerated GDP growth, with direct links to the rural economy would be required to make 
significant inroads in poverty. Increased efforts to fully restore access and improve quality of basic 
social services will also be required, especially in the CNW and rural areas.  

41.      The JSAN also cautioned against the high PRSP financing estimates which assumed 
strong revenue collection and cocoa prices, early attainment of HIPC Completion Point and the 
willingness of donors to provide additional concessional financing.  The JSAN recommended that 
the authorities prioritize PRSP projects to channel available financing to critical areas; vigorously 
pursue the policy of  primary fiscal surpluses  to generate domestic resources; seek external financing 
mainly in the form of grants and highly concessional loans, while monitoring closely overall debt 
sustainability; implement the HIPC floating completion point triggers as soon as possible; and 
explore opportunities for public-private partnerships and avoid expensive domestic and regional 
borrowing. 

Key Development Challenges and Opportunities 

42.      The following are key challenges and opportunities for implementing the PRSP and 
achieving its objectives. 

Continued implementation of the peace process and ensuring sustainable peace 

43.      Although security has improved and there is free movement between the north and 
south, the country needs to make additional progress toward reunification.  At the local level, 

10 

 
 
elected officials, mayors and presidents of general councils, and decentralized government 
authorities, Préfets and Sous-préfets, face difficulties in executing their duties due to weak capacity 
and lack of resources and equipment. Fiscal decentralization has lagged behind in the 
decentralization process and there is lack of transparency around revenue collection and how central 
government resources are distributed to the local level. FN control in the CNW has introduced an 
added layer of dysfunction as FN commanders continue to collect taxes and provide security and 
other services in the CNW, despite the return of civil servants and government officials. The 
Government needs to normalize the governance situation in the CNW, and this is linked to the peace 
process moving forward and presidential and parliamentary and local elections being held. 
Reestablishing one fiscal administration will likely continue to be difficult while the FN commanders 
are uncertain about alternative prospects. 

44.      Meanwhile, the DDR program (supported by the UN, EU and World Bank), which 
according to the OPA should be completed prior to elections, has stalled. The delays are in part 
due to complications in sorting out rank and compensation issues between the FN and the FANCI 
(the national army).  There are also not enough barracks to house the integrated forces, which would 
bring 4,000 FN into the police and gendarmerie and 5,000 to the military.  Another challenge 
includes difficulties in confirming and finalizing the list of militia personnel eligible for the DDR 
program and the lack of funds to provide the promised cash allowance ($1,000) for each ex-
combatant and militia member. Integrated police and military units to ensure safety at voting sites 
have been established in the ex-buffer zone but only one has been created in the North out of the 10 
that are planned. These are short term issues that need to be resolved while over the long term the 
security sector needs to be reformed. 

45.      Completing the national identification program and modernizing the civil registry, 
which are both well underway, will also help reduce opportunities for exclusion, victimization 
and discrimination based on ethnic origin. These efforts are also fundamental to improve access to 
social services, especially education, as identification papers are required for the Ivorian schooling 
system. Land tenure issues, at the heart of the conflict, remain largely unresolved, and left 
unaddressed will continue to contribute to social fragility. Of the estimated 25 million hectares under 
cultivation, less than two percent have titles. In addition, an estimated 700,000 people were displaced 
by the conflict. Resolving land ownership issues will facilitate the return to their residence of origin. 

Improving PFM and governance in key economic sectors 

46.      Public expenditure management suffers from a distorted budget cycle, lack of 
transparency, and expenditure execution problems. Fiscal discipline has weakened and budget 
allocations to the social sectors (health and education) have declined significantly since 2000, 
contributing to the deteriorated state of social services. Budget comprehensiveness and transparency 
is compromised by an inadequate budget nomenclature and classification, inadequate consolidation 
of public entities in the global budget, and lack of clear rules for budget transfers to local 
governments.  In budget execution, there are long lags in the cycle of approvals and processing; also, 
budget execution reports are not fully reliable due to infrequent reconciliation between budget and 
accounting systems. Information on budget allocations and execution has not been readily available 
to the public. Controls are weak and the Chamber of Accounts is not entirely operational.  Despite 
advances made under a new public procurement code, many contracts do not follow a competitive 
bidding process, and there are insufficient ex-post controls of the procurement process. Public 
dissemination remains inadequate. 

11 

 
 
47.      The cocoa sector, which accounts for nearly 25 percent of exports and 17 percent of 
public revenue, suffers from being heavily taxed, but many of these levies have not been used as 
intended to benefit producers. Corruption and lack of transparency associated with cocoa sector 
management agencies, including procurement methods for some large contracts, a lack of legitimate 
producer representation, and inadequate producer incentives have undermined cocoa’s potential 
contribution to rural growth and poverty reduction.  

48.      The oil and gas sector also faces a number of governance challenges: (a) inadequate 
controls on oil export shipments; (b) lack of efficiency and transparency in government management 
of hydrocarbon revenues; (c) 
the 
lack of an adequate 
legal framework for 
investors; 
(d) environmental risks of petroleum operations; and (e) poorly-negotiated contracts which have led 
to very high gas prices for the national electricity company.  Activities in the mining sub-sector have 
not traditionally been important but they are now acquiring significant proportions, notably in gold 
and manganese. Côte d’Ivoire’s participation in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative 
(EITI) is an important step toward increasing transparency and accountability in these sectors. 

49.      Governance issues in the electricity sector include a high level of fraud and technical 
losses, a dysfunctional institutional framework, a reluctance to charge better-off consumers 
and enterprises adequate tariffs, poor bill collection, large public sector arrears, and 
inappropriate supplier contracts for gas. These have created high costs and led to fiscal deficits 
that have imposed an enormous burden on the national budget, reducing government’s ability to 
finance other priorities. In addition, the institutional arrangements of the three state institutions 
responsible for regulation and technical and financial supervision are ineffective, unwieldy and 
costly. 

50.      Government intervention in the financial sector has weakened financial institutions: 
The state’s share of bank capital increased from 22 percent to 29 percent between 2006 and 2008 and 
the number of institutions under state control increased from two to four as a result of ad hoc 
interventions.  These institutions are unable to respond to the financing needs of SMEs, the 
agriculture sector and low-income housing, all of which have a high demand for financing.  
Furthermore, the government has accumulated sizable domestic arrears to the private sector which 
has affected the solvency of suppliers and increased non-performing loans. 

51.      Despite the important role that micro-financing can play in boosting economic activity, 
the major networks are virtually bankrupt. Micro-finance institutions represent only 4 percent of 
financial sector deposits, but the social impact of the sector is significant owing to the large number 
of clients. Many microfinance institutions are characterized by weak capacity, with inadequate 
accounting and monitoring tools, a lack of viable management and information systems, and the 
absence of strategic planning. The sector is also building up non-performing loans. 

Improving the performance of the agriculture sector 

52.      Agriculture employs two-thirds of the labor force and improving rural and agricultural 
incomes is pivotal to reducing poverty. Rural incomes have declined in large part due to reduced 
agricultural revenues, but also from the loss of assets (plantations, livestock and small non-
agricultural businesses) and reduced rural employment opportunities. Agricultural incomes have 
dropped due to a combination of deep-seated governance problems, weak or non-existent agriculture 
research and extension, predatory tax policies and related corruption in the cocoa sector, and high 

12 

 
 
 
transaction costs due to the massive degradation of transport infrastructure and racketeering. Women 
in rural areas are economically the most disadvantaged. See Box 2. 

53.      Agriculture’s potential is constrained by a decline in productivity and vulnerability to 
price fluctuations:  Low productivity is an issue for several key crops, notably cocoa and cotton.  
Cocoa yields and quality have deteriorated as plantations have aged, and new plantings have 
dwindled as farmers increasingly turn to other crops which have been subject to less government 
interference, such as rubber and palm oil. In the north, cotton’s decline is largely linked to the recent 
crisis and consequent disruptions in the input and output markets, with significant negative impact on 
farmers in the region, where poverty rates are highest. 

54.      Lack of value addition diminishes wealth-creation and revenue potential. Although true 
for most commodities, this is most notable for cashews, given that Côte d’Ivoire became the top 
world exporter of raw cashew nuts in 2008. Cashews are exported in raw form, mainly to India where 
they are processed and re-exported at higher prices.  Transforming and processing agricultural 
products locally could create jobs if done efficiently, while increasing the export value of 
commodities. 

55.      The 2008 food price crisis highlighted food insecurity issues. Major increases in the price 
of rice and cooking oil in 2008 were particularly painful for urban households. To mitigate the 
impact, government reduced tariffs on imports and absorbed some of these costs.  The experience, 
however, has created new opportunities for households that are net producers of food. In particular, 
increasing rice production is considered a top priority.  Côte d’Ivoire produces about 800,000 MT of 
paddy and imports over 700,000 MT of processed rice annually, and this sustained dependence on 
imports is widely viewed as a disadvantage, but also an opportunity, considering the potential for 
much higher domestic production. 

56.      New agricultural technology can help mitigate the impact of global climate change on 
the population of Côte d’Ivoire. High rainfall in the south of the country supports a bounty of rain-
fed crops but contributes increasingly to flooding conditions, while the semi-arid northern savannah 
may be affected adversely by increased droughts. Climate stress in the Sahelian neighbors is 
expected to increase immigration to Côte d’Ivoire and other coastal countries. The almost complete 
elimination of Côte d’Ivoire’s rainforest by unrestricted logging and conversion to agriculture has 
contributed to climate change. To feed the growing population, agricultural productivity and 
efficiency of water use must improve while protecting already stressed ecosystems. Long-term and 
large-scale integrated resource management will be required to satisfy increased demands on natural 
resources for food, bio-energy, and ecosystem services while conserving biodiversity and 
maintaining carbon stocks in land and forests. A national plan for disaster risk mitigation also needs 
to be established once the most urgent political and social crises have been addressed. 

13 

 
 
 
Box 2: Gender Parity Issues in Côte d’Ivoire  

Côte d’Ivoire’s Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, the Convention on Elimination of 
Discrimination Against Women has been ratified and government policy encourages the full participation of women 
in social and economic life. However, socio-cultural factors limit women’s ownership of land and other capital, their 
access to education and health services and their participation in the formal sector. 
Laws protecting women from violence are weak and spousal abuse is frequent and not penalized. The law prohibits 
rape and imposes prison terms of five to ten years. Nonetheless, both pro-government and rebel forces have 
subjected thousands of women and girls to rape and other brutal sexual assaults with impunity.  
Ivorian women and men have equal land ownership rights. However, only 5 percent of land owners are women. 
When women marry, the law considers husbands to be the head of the household and gives them the authority to 
manage assets.  Men have a dominant role in the production of commodity crops, such as cocoa and cotton, whereas 
women are more active in small agricultural cooperatives producing primarily food crops. Access to finance is also 
difficult for women because they often cannot produce a title to a house or are not producing a profitable cash crop. 
Gender inequality and challenges for women are also reflected in health and education indicators (discussed in the 
section on MDGs). Sector policies to reduce gender disparities between men and women focus largely on health and 
education and reducing gender-based violence.  

Strengthening institutions and the environment for a revitalized private sector 

57.      The private sector is dominated by micro and small businesses that are largely 
informal, but also includes an important formal sector of large businesses. Although precise data 
are difficult to obtain, it is estimated that there are some 5,000 formal SMEs contributing about 18 
percent of the country’s GDP and employing 23 percent of the formal workforce.  In addition, there 
are some 10,000 very small enterprises/micro enterprises, mostly informal.  Large enterprises are 
estimated to number around 400, representing a significant formal private sector with strong foreign 
investors and large agribusinesses active in the cocoa, palm-oil, sugar and cotton sectors.  

58.      Instability and weakened institutions have hurt the business environment and 
investment climate.  Businesses cite political instability and lack of access to finance as their largest 
constraints and most immediate concerns. 7  Corruption and informal sector practices are the third 
most important constraint raised by small and medium sized enterprises, and these are linked to over-
taxation and regulation of formal activities. The country scores low on ease of doing business, ranked 
166th out of 183 countries. 8
  Cumbersome regulations also impede the creation and operation of 
enterprises, especially for SMEs. Political instability has also led to further deterioration in the 
judicial environment and lack of enforcement of contracts, while widespread fraud has reduced 
profitability and deterred new foreign and domestic investment. 

59.      The financial and private sectors are vulnerable due to their dependency on 
commodities. Most of the activity in the manufacturing, transportation and trade and retail sectors is 
linked to the production and export of cocoa, coffee and cotton, commodities that are vulnerable to 
price and demand fluctuations.  

60.      Life insurance and pension schemes are under-developed. Côte d’Ivoire has a very small 
contractual savings sector consisting of 11 life insurance companies and two pension schemes—both

of which are in difficulty. Underdevelopment of these non-bank financial institutions is an obstacle to 
developing meaningful long-term savings.  The life insurance industry and the pension schemes are 
potentially significant sources of long-term funds as they are being reformed and can tap into the 
existing potential for savings mobilization. 

61.      A high rate of non-performing loans has made credit more expensive and access to 
financial services is limited.  Nearly 20 percent of loans by commercial banks are non-performing, 
and for some banks this figure exceeds 50 percent.  A high level of non-performing assets at 
commercial banks translates into low deposit and savings rates and high lending rates to cover 
overhead expenses.  Less than 4 percent of the population has a bank account or uses banking 
services.  

62.      Lack of skills, know-how and competitiveness prevail. Côte d’Ivoire’s SME sector has lost 
international exposure and experience on modern management methods and standards during the 
decade of crisis.  As a result, technical and managerial capability in the business community is now 
low and constitutes an obstacle to new technology adoption, worker productivity improvement and 
new product development. The labor force also lacks the skills needed in the economy. 

Maintaining and investing in infrastructure services 

63.      The failure to invest in and maintain transport infrastructure has resulted in physical 
deterioration and reduced mobility. Since the colonial period, the country’s economic growth was 
accompanied by heavy investment in transport infrastructure. The road network increased from 
25,000 km in 1960 to 82,000 km in 2000, through important investments in rail, ports, and air 
transport sub-sectors. However, further significant investments were then curtailed and have only 
recently restarted. During the crisis, road maintenance programs were suspended in the CNW and 
significantly reduced in the south, restricting access to basic economic and social services.  

64.      Rural and urban areas face different, though equally pressing, infrastructure 
challenges. In rural areas, degraded transport infrastructure has made travel more difficult and 
isolated communities. Reduced access to markets and inputs due to infrastructure constraints has 
contributed to increased poverty, notably in the CNW. Meanwhile, urban living conditions have 
become hazardous, including in the once-model city of Abidjan, which today is characterized by 
i) overcrowding and the proliferation of slums due to rapid urbanization; ii) weak capacity of public 
operators to respond to growing population demands; (iii) lack of maintenance of infrastructure, and 
iv) low priority given to waste water and storm water issues. Garbage piles stagnate in 
neighborhoods creating health and pollution risks. Clogged sewers and drains lead to urban flooding 
during the rainy season. Scarcely 40 percent of the urban population has access to adequate 
sanitation. Addressing these issues will help eradicate endemic diseases such as malaria and typhoid 
which most affect very poor neighborhoods. In the countryside, only one third of households have 
access to any sanitation facilities, of which only 10 percent have access to adequate systems.  

65.      Energy infrastructure suffers from lack of maintenance, system overload, and financial 
difficulties. Access to modern energy sources in Côte d’Ivoire is limited, with over three-quarters of 
households dependent on cheap wood charcoal, though this has environmental and health costs in the 
long term. Although it does not reach many rural areas, a solid national infrastructure for electricity 
and hydrocarbons was built through tremendous effort and still remains in place. However, the lack 
of investment and maintenance of the electricity sub-sector has created risks of breakdowns and 
overloads and an inability to meet rising domestic demand and export commitments. Moreover the 

15 

 
 
sector is facing financial imbalance due to inadequate rates and tariff structure, high gas prices and a 
dysfunctional institutional framework. The hydrocarbon subsector is also facing financing difficulties 
for upstream activities (exploration, development and production) and needs to adapt legislation to 
attract new investment to the sector in a transparent manner. 

66.      Water supply has increased but there are frequent service disruptions and large 
portions of the population have no access to potable water.  Government efforts in the water 
sector, supported principally by the EU and the World Bank, resulted in increased national access to 
potable water, from 46 percent in 1998 to 81 percent in 2008. However, the sector is expected to 
confront a difficult situation in big cities due to uncontrolled urbanization, pollution, and water 
scarcity. Over 13 million people still face disruptions in water service. Only 68 percent of rural 
households have access to an improved water source. 

Increasing pro-poor investments and building human capital 

67.      Education outcomes have not improved in many years.  Teacher wages absorb a 
significant share of spending in the sector, crowding out other priorities. The quality of teachers is 
poor with high absenteeism rates, investments in classrooms and teaching materials inadequate and 
school fees are unaffordable for many. As a result, less than 50 percent of children are enrolled in 
schools and 63 percent of the population between the ages of 15-45 is illiterate. Secondary schools 
are poorly funded and overcrowded. The tertiary level is marked by a low level of investments in 
universities, poor teaching conditions and a disconnect between teaching curricula and the demands 
of the market place, all of which have resulted in an overflow of under-qualified and poorly trained 
graduates who cannot find employment. Most alarmingly, militant student groups dominate some 
university campuses and have politicized and criminalized the university system. Vocational and 
professional training are not well developed and tend to be tailored to modern job opportunities, 
rather than building the skills needed for opportunities in the non-agricultural informal sector. 9
 See 
Box 3 on youth vulnerability and unemployment. 

68.      Despite growing poverty and vulnerability, social protection has received very little 
attention and safety nets are basically inexistent.  Yet, safety nets are essential tools not only for 
protecting the poor and vulnerable, but also for promoting economic growth.  In particular, they have 
an immediate impact on inequality and poverty, which makes them an appropriate instrument to 
address one of the main drivers of the recent conflict, i.e., the perceived discrimination against 
certain groups and the greater poverty of the CNW.  The sector is characterized by a multiplicity of 
small fragmented interventions that are implemented with little coordination, unknown effectiveness 
and limited outside assistance. 

69.      It should be noted that the Government has started to reverse the deterioration in basic 
service provision by redeploying public services throughout the country and progressively 
rehabilitating education, health, and village water supply infrastructures.

Box 3: The Crisis of Youth Unemployment and Vulnerability  

Côte d’Ivoire’s population is young: 50 percent are younger than 15 years old and those aged 15-39 represent 
another 40 percent of the total population. As in other developing countries, youth in Côte d’Ivoire are a particularly 
vulnerable group. According to official statistics, about 4 million Ivorian youth are unemployed or underemployed. 
Before the September 2002 armed conflict, low education levels, a sluggish economy and high unemployment rates 
already constituted increasingly serious obstacles to youth seeking to launch a productive life.  Subsequent to the 
conflict, the depressed economy and schools closing further limited youth employment and exposed them to a host 
of new risks 10
.  It is estimated that in 2002 about 26,000 enterprises employed 550,000 persons.  In 2006, only 
13,000 enterprises were left employing less than 300,000 persons. The exodus of French SMS businesses after 
violent events in November 2004 cost over 30,000 jobs.  In parallel, there has been an increase in small activities in 
the informal agriculture sector as salaried formal employment has diminished. Disenfranchised youth have been an 
easily mobilized and manipulated force for the political gain of the main actors of the crisis.  They have been 
enrolled in various fighting forces, trained and armed as paramilitary groups, or organized into political resistance 
groups and self-defense committees (“young patriots”) to intimidate opponents and man roadside checkpoints. 

Regional integration 

70.      Regional cooperation and integration is an important aspect of Côte d’Ivoire’s recovery 
and future growth. Regional markets offer many trade and economic opportunities for the country if 
it manages to improve the quality of agricultural products and electricity production and services and 
to rehabilitate transportation infrastructure. Continued progress with peace-building efforts is also 
critical for regional stability. 

71.      With the crisis, Côte d’Ivoire began losing its competitive edge in the sub-regional 
economy. Côte d'Ivoire is still a hub for the regional electricity market exporting power to 
neighboring countries (Ghana, Togo, Benin and Burkina Faso). However its exports capacity has 
decreased since 2004 as domestic demand has grown and no additional generation capacity has been 
established since 2000. The diversion of trade through neighboring ports also made the country less 
competitive and less well integrated. Since 2002, regional integration reforms have slowed down 
significantly and Côte d’Ivoire did not comply with most WAEMU convergence criteria in 2007 and 
2008. 

72.      Côte d’Ivoire’s regional and international integration efforts have improved since 2008. 
The Government’s reform program is helping improve the country’s compliance with WAEMU 
convergence criteria, including as regards the budget classification and expenditures, fiduciary 
standards, procurement and inflation levels. Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana and Nigeria are also seeking to 
establish an integrated West African Securities Market. Meanwhile Côte d’Ivoire signed an interim 
Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the European Union in November 2008. The 
agreement is the first of its kind and combines a trade agreement with development assistance to 
Côte d’Ivoire. The EU plans to eventually conclude a full EPA with ECOWAS to promote 
competitiveness, growth and investment while accelerating regional integration. 

10 It is estimated that about 30 percent of the persons aged 15-39 were unemployed in 2002 and, although there is no 
reliable information available, it is appears that unemployment among youth has increased considerably since then.

V. THE WORLD BANK GROUP PROGRAM TO SUPPORT THE PRSP 

G. Lessons from the Bank Group’s Experience in Côte d’Ivoire  

73.      The most recent full CAS for Côte d’Ivoire was prepared in 1997 and was followed by 
an Interim CAS discussed by the Board in June 2002. Implementation of the I-CAS was 
interrupted by the September 2002 armed conflict and the IDA program was suspended in June 2004 
due to arrears. During the period of IDA suspension, the Bank remained engaged in Côte d’Ivoire 
through: i) analytical activities and a program of LICUS and PCF trust funds which supported the 
reintegration of child soldiers, community rehabilitation in FN-controlled zone and the employment of 
youth-at-risk; and ii) a US$120 million grant for a Post-Conflict Assistance Project, exceptionally 
approved in 2007 prior to IDA arrears clearance.  

74.      A Country Assistance Review (CAR) in 1999 11
 examined the Bank’s experience in Côte 
d’Ivoire during the previous 30 years. Although the country environment and the Bank’s approach 
to development have significantly evolved since then, it is worth noting the following points on the 
Bank’s experience: 

• Lending to Côte d’Ivoire has been particularly successful in areas where the Bank has had an 
ongoing, long-standing working relationship with the country and a consistent strategy. 
Examples cited include agricultural and infrastructure projects as well as operations to restore 
Côte d’Ivoire’s competitive position in the financial and private sector and to rationalize the 
regulatory framework. 
• The performance of structural adjustment lending to help the Government deal with crisis 
situations has been less positive. Three large adjustment loans between 1983 and 1996 (averaging 
$245 million each) were fully disbursed and their outcomes rated unsatisfactory. If large quick- 
disbursing operations are part of the Bank program, OED/IEG recommends avoiding large 
disbursement tranches because of the overwhelming pressure to disburse when countries are in 
critical financial situations. 
• Bank support to the social sectors, notably to help improve health and education outcomes, has 
had little effect. As mentioned previously, this is in part due to how resources have been 
allocated to these sectors and governance issues resulting in the deteriorating state of human 
capital. Many social sector projects financed by the Bank have closed unsatisfactory, with the 
notable exception of the Human Resource Development Management project. The CAR 
recommended that the Bank focus on pro-poor growth and help the government identify policy 
changes that benefit both the poor and growth prospects. 
• Greater attention should be given to institutional issues since problems encountered in 
implementation are often of an institutional nature, particularly for projects in social sectors.  

Bank experience under the ISN 

75.      The Bank discussed an Interim Strategy Note on April 1, 2008, which covered a 
program of gradual reengagement following the clearance of arrears to IDA. During the ISN 
period (FY08-FY09), budget support operations have performed relatively well whereas investment

18 

 
 
 
 
                                                   
operations have had mixed results. Two DPOs approved by the Bank, the Economic Governance and 
Recovery Grant I 12
 (April 2008) and II (March 2009), have been rated moderately satisfactory and 
satisfactory, respectively. Under these instruments the government has moved forward with some 
fundamental basic reforms to begin restoring discipline and transparency in public financial 
management and in key economic sectors, as well as to reach the HIPC Completion Point. Despite 
significant efforts to fast-track preparation and implementation of operations, under OP/BP 8.0 
(Rapid Response to Crisis and Emergencies) investment programs have not moved as quickly as 
desired, often due to institutional and fiduciary constraints.  This has also been true for some of the 
projects reactivated following the lifting of the suspension, again due to institutional constraints that 
are not uncommon to fragile and post-conflict states. As such, while many of the ISN results 
supported by DPOs have been reached, whereas most of the results supported by investment 
operations have not, underscoring the importance of establishing realistic and modest outcomes 
during the CPS period (see Annex 2 on ISN Results). Investment operations supporting infrastructure 
activities, such as the Emergency Urban Rehabilitation Project (FY08), have disbursed relatively 
quickly and are being implemented satisfactorily. 

76.      During the ISN period, the Bank began to re-staff the Bank Group Abidjan office in 
anticipation of the full reengagement in the country. A new Country Director was posted to Abidjan 
in July 2008. IFC has also begun reengaging and a new IFC Resident Representative was appointed 
in January 2010. 

H. Portfolio and Financial Management 

77.      As of March 1, 2010, the portfolio comprises 9 active projects financed by IDA, 
representing commitments of $637 million, with an undisbursed balance of US$313 million. The 
portfolio includes three reactivated projects supporting education, transport and rural development 
with undisbursed commitments of $104 million at the time of Bank reengagement.  In fiscal year 
2009, IDA provided a US$150 million budget support grant for economic governance reforms, and the 
Board approved a US$50 million IDA grant for an Urgent Electricity Rehabilitation Project. These two 
operations included frontloaded IDA 15 resources to help mitigate the impact of the 2008 food price 
crisis and the 2009 financial crisis and global recession. In October 2009, the Bank’s Board approved a 
$15 million IDA grant financing to support a SME Revitalization and Governance grant. 

78.      Trust Funds represent an important source of financing for Bank activities in Côte 
d’Ivoire.  There are nine projects financed by trust funds, representing commitments of $10 million, 
with undisbursed commitments of $6 million. These include the Global Environment Facility (GEF); 
the State and Peace-Building Fund (SPF), 13
 the Institutional Development Fund (IDF); and the 
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative Multi-Donor Trust Fund (EITI MDTF).  These funds 
have provided a platform for supporting technical assistance activities, providing just-in-time support 
for analytical work and capacity-building, and responding to specific requests for support that 
doesn’t require large amounts of financing. Some of these trust funds can also be susceptible to the 
same institutional constraints as IDA operations but on the whole are performing satisfactorily.  

12The operation consisted of a US$308 million development policy grant, of which US$273 million financed the 
arrears due to IDA (Côte d’Ivoire itself paid US$241 million toward arrears clearance). 
13 In 2009, the Trust Fund for Low-Income Countries (LICUS) and the Post-Conflict Fund (PCF) were combined 
into one State and Peace Building Fund (SPF). 

19 

 
                                                   
79.      The Bank portfolio is characterized by slow disbursements and weak fiduciary capacity, 
which the Bank is working with counterparts to strengthen. Political events and the 2004 suspension 
of IDA operations had a negative impact on project performance and weakened the internal control 
environment, creating greater overall fiduciary risks. A review of portfolio issues prior to the 2004 
suspension revealed a lack of follow-up on recommendations of external audits. To mitigate these 
risks, the Bank has sought to simplify the design of projects; undertake implementation support 
mission that provide more intensive involvement of Bank staff; provide intensive capacity building 
programs, and involve the Authorities in the implementation of audit findings. Intensive fiduciary 
supervisions, including reviews of audit reports and interim financial reports, full on-site 
supervisions covering all areas of financial management, review of internal controls, disbursement 
arrangements, and audit arrangements are being undertaken for projects with financial management 
risk ratings above substantial.  Most task team leaders have been decentralized and are based in 
Abidjan. The Bank is looking at social accountability mechanisms to strengthen community based-
projects, as well as raising awareness about the need for public disclosure and handling of complaints 
and appeals regarding Bank-financed activities.  

80.      Measures have also been taken by the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) to 
improve project implementation by assigning to each IDA operation a public accountant reporting 
to the MEF and a financial controller in charge of the prior internal control of all payments under the 
the project. This arrangement constitutes a good internal control system for project implementation 
units. The Bank will continue to support this arrangement while ensuring it does not create a 
bottleneck for implementation. 

81.      IFC’s current total committed portfolio as of March 2010 is US$70 million.  The largest 
investments are a US$48.7 million equity investment in Devon Energy Côte d’Ivoire (oil and gas) 
and a US$13.3 million loan to the Azito power station, both of which performed well throughout the 
crisis years. In July 2008, IFC approved a US$5 million trade line to Ecobank Côte d’Ivoire and 
more recently, an a additional US$9.8 million is proposed to be allocated from IFC’s Capitalization 
Fund to Ecobank Côte d’Ivoire in the form of equity and subordinated debt. 

82.      MIGA’s existing portfolio consists of one agribusiness project issued in 1999 to Touton 
SA of France for their investment in the rehabilitation of three cocoa plantations and the 
expansion of a production facility. This is MIGA’s first and only supported project in the country.  
The current gross outstanding exposure from this investment is $9.1 million, down from the original 
$16.4 million insured. 

I. CPS Strategic Objectives 

83.      During the CPS period, the Bank Group seeks to help improve quality of life, boost 
economic activity and support stabilization in the short term; while continuing to help Côte 
d’Ivoire lay the groundwork for long term reforms to help achieve sustainable peace and 
growth and make progress toward the MDGs. Projects will be implemented throughout the 
country, including in the CNW where IDA is already present. Although conditions in the CNW are 
complicated by the extraordinary governance situation created by the politico-military crisis, Bank 
support for job creation and basic services is critical to reduce geographic inequities, encourage 
normalization and the return of Internally Displaced Persons (IDP). The Bank will also be present in 

20 

 
 
a number of sectors in the near term and will become more selective as more development partners 
reengage. 

84.      The Bank’s support to Côte d’Ivoire will be articulated around four strategic 
objectives, or pillars: 1) Strengthening governance and institutions; 2) Improving the 
performance of agriculture; 3) Strengthening the private sector; and 4) Renewing 
infrastructure and basic services. Job creation, with a particular focus on youth, and mainstreaming 
gender and improving women’s economic opportunities, are cross-cutting objectives.  The following 
section describes: i) the results sought under each pillar; ii) the on-going and proposed analytical 
support and financing instruments of the World Bank Group 
to achieve those results; 
iii) coordination with development partners; and iv) pillar risks.  The strategic objectives and 
outcomes are summarized in Table 3 below.

85.      Under this pillar, the Bank will support the objectives of the PRSP’s first and second 
Strategic Outcomes (Restoring the Foundations of the Nation and Transforming Côte d‘Ivoire 
into an Emerging Economy) by supporting implementation of the OPA and helping rebuild 

21 

 
 
 
institutions and strengthen economic governance, both in PFM and sectors such as cocoa, energy and 
financial services.  The focus on PFM seeks to ensure that public expenditures are allocated to PRSP 
priority sectors, including investing more effectively in basic education and health services. The 
focus on key economic sectors seeks to ensure that those sectors that generate significant revenues 
can have the greatest impact on economic growth and that the wealth created is more equitably 
shared. Analytical work and development policy grants under this pillar will support the Bank’s 
Governance and Anti-Corruption (GAC) strategy. 

Expected CPS Outcomes: 

1.1 Continued progress in crisis recovery and improved prospects for sustained peace 
1.2 More efficient and transparent management of public financial resources 
1.3 
Improved debt management and increased pro-poor spending 
1.4 
Improved governance in key economic sectors 

86.      CPS Outcome 1.1: Continued progress in crisis recovery and improved prospects for 
sustained peace. The entire Bank Group effort seeks to support this outcome as a prerequisite to 
long-term sustainable development. However, the Post Conflict Assistance Project (PCAP) approved 
in 2007 was specifically designed to help accelerate recovery and peace by improving conflict-
affected communities’ and individual’s opportunities for economic reintegration and access to social 
services. The project finances labor intensive public works, vocational training and support for self 
employment for ex-combatants and youth at risk, and community rehabilitation activities (with a 
view to restoring small infrastructure and social services in the most underserved areas).  The on-
going LICUS Youth Employment pilot also supports these efforts. In addition, the PCAP and an SPF 
grant to safeguard and modernize the civil registry will continue to also support the reinstatement of 
the public administration throughout the country, by rehabilitating and furnishing offices of 
decentralized and local authorities.  Additional financing from the SPF approved in FY10 is also 
allowing the Bank to continue supporting legal services for vulnerable populations and preventing 
and responding to gender-based violence. See also CPS Outcome 5.2 on Mainstreaming Gender and 
Improving Women’s Economic Opportunities. 

87.      Building on the experience of the PCAP and LICUS pilot, the Bank will also prepare an 
Employment and Training Opportunities for Youth project in FY11. The project would focus on 
labor-intensive public works for youth throughout the country, as well as training, internship and job 
opportunities in partnership with the public and private sector.  

88.      CPS Outcome 1.2. More efficient and transparent management of public financial 
resources.  During the CPS period, the Bank will continue to monitor the macro-economic situation 
and prepare updates to the 2008 Public Expenditure Management and Financial Assessment Report 
(PEMFAR) to underpin future policy-based budget support operations. The Bank will undertake a 
study on the Use of Country Systems to determine how the public financial management system 
could be used for financial management arrangements of investment lending projects, while ensuring 
that Bank fiduciary requirements relating to these operations are met. 

89.      IDA will support the government’s action plan to 
implement the PEMFAR 
recommendations through the IDA development policy operations (DPO) series, the Economic 

22 

 
 
 
Governance and Reform Grants, a TA operation and future PRSG support. Efforts will focus 
on improving efficiency and transparency in budget preparation and execution and sharing of 
information; strengthening the interface between the budget execution information system, the 
procurement information system, treasury accounting and payroll; extending the government’s 
financial management information system (SIGFIP) to local branches of government throughout the 
country; monitoring the implementation of a global Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF); 
improving external auditing mechanisms by promulgating the organic law creating the Auditor-
General’s Office, appointing the judges and clearing the backlog of the audit of Budget Review Acts 
and State Accounts; improving internal audit systems and procedures; implementing WAEMU 
guidelines; strengthening public procurement practices and setting up the National Public 
Procurement Regulatory Authority (ANRMP); and fighting corruption.  

The Bank will pursue trust-fund financing to build the capacity of parliament to play its 
oversight role in the budget process. Other demand-side governance activities will help increase 
transparency, support Government communications efforts and build the capacity of non-government 
actors to monitor the use of public resources (see Box 4). 

Box 4: Communications and Demand-Side Governance Côte d’Ivoire 

The Governance and Institutional Development IDA Grant and a State and Peace-building Fund 
(SPF) grant signed in November 2009 are supporting activities to increase communications, 
accountability and transparency around the government’s economic reform program. Whereas the IDA 
grant is supporting assistance to implement the Government’s reform program more broadly, the SPF grant is 
solely focused on building the communication capacities of government, media and CSOs to increase 
transparency and public accountability, raise awareness of reforms, and facilitate public monitoring of their 
implementation through three components: 1) Assisting government with a communications strategy and 
program around  three themes: a) FM, focusing on the transparency of budget formulation and execution; 
and tracking/reporting on pro-poor expenditures and revenues and expenditures from natural resources; 
b) The petroleum sector, including supporting implementation of EITI; and c) The coffee/cocoa sector – 
monitoring improved governance of the sector and producer revenues; 2) Strengthening non-
government/CSO capacity to participate in and monitor economic governance reforms; and 
3) strengthening the capacity of the media to report on the reform program.  The IDA TA has financed 
a workshop with journalists, the publication of a Ministry of Economy and Finance newsletter and the 
launching of a new web site, www.minecofin.gouv.ci, which publishes quarterly budget updates). 

The above activities are coordinated with a grant from the Governance Partnership Facility for 
“Public Expenditure Management Reform through Budget Publication and other Social 
Accountability Approaches.” The grant approved in FY10 is financing activities in Côte d’Ivoire and 3 
other countries to help publish and disseminate disaggregated public sector budget and expenditure 
information; support training and leadership innovations related to budget disclosure; help to build multi-
stakeholder national coalitions for public expenditure disclosure, discourse, analysis, monitoring and 
management; and engage multiple stakeholder for transparency of sub-national finances. The Bank is also 
carrying out a governance diagnostic in early 2010, which is expected to strengthen the knowledge-base on 
the quality of public services and perceptions of corruption. The findings of the diagnostic will help 
determine what demand-side governance activities the Government and Bank could consider supporting in 
the future.  The Bank will pursue IDF financing to help build capacity of the parliament in providing checks 
and balances on PFM issues. 

23 

 
 
90.      CPS Outcome 1.3. Improved debt sustainability and increased pro-poor spending.  The 
Bank will continue to support reforms aimed at reaching the HIPC Completion Point and accessing 
debt relief through Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). The EGRG series will continue to 
support the Government’s program to clear domestic arrears and ensure spending is aligned with pro-
poor priorities and the PRSP. The reduced debt obligations will increase fiscal space and enable Côte 
d’Ivoire to channel resources to medium-term expenditure priorities in education, health, water and 
sanitation, roads, rural development and food security, and rural electrification. 

91.      CPS Outcome 1.4. Improved governance in key economic sectors.  The Bank will 
continue to support reforms to improve the transparency and efficiency of the cocoa, energy and 
financial sectors through the EGRG and PRSG series outlined above, as well as through the IDA TA 
operation for Governance and Institutional Development. These reforms are necessary to attract new 
private investment in these sectors, and will be a precursor to IFC financing to the private sector. 

92.      In the cocoa-coffee sector, reforms will help government address governance and 
transparency issues and improve producer incomes. Priorities include: supporting the design and 
implementation of a comprehensive strategy for reforming the cocoa sector (in accordance with 
Government’s 2009 Letter of Sector Policy); further reducing fiscal and para-fiscal levies and 
reducing total taxation to 22 percent by 2011 to increase farmers’ share of sales revenues; completing 
and implementing the recommendations of the external audits of the four cocoa entities, ensuring 
proper use of the cocoa-financed rural investment fund, resolving problems with cocoa weighing, 
quality control and bagging; and auditing the census of farmers to ensure proper representation.  See 
Box 5 on the Government’s cocoa sector reform program. 

93.      In energy and mining, the focus is on supporting the implementation of the Extractive 
Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and improving the capacity of the Ministry of Mines and 
Energy (MME) and the Government to monitor and revive the mining sector. IDA and trust fund 
support will focus on raising awareness of public and private stakeholders; building the capacity of 
the National Council representatives (civil society members) to better estimate and follow revenue 
streams from the extractive industries; and build a knowledge and documentation base for improving 
extractive industries management and fostering good governance in the sector. Activities also include 
reviewing the legal and regulatory framework as it relates to the fiscal regime and social and 
environmental regulations as well as strengthening capacity at the MME to enforce modern 
requirements for these frameworks. Also, Bank assistance aims to upgrade the Mining Cadastre Unit 
to better monitor license processing and ownership of property rights. Other possible areas of focus 
will be the diamond chain and related enforcement of the Kimberley process; assistance in designing 
programs to encourage the local procurement of goods and services by the mining industry; and 
increasing value-added, including through business spin-offs in the supply chain.  

94.      Côte d’Ivoire may participate within the next two years in the joint WBI/AFR Regional 
Governance for Extractive Industries Program. The program seeks to extend capacity building on 
revenue stream transparency to other sections of the value chain.  Côte d’Ivoire may also benefit 
from the West Africa Regional Mineral Sector Initiative that seeks to improve governments’ capacity 
to manage minerals sector in a transparent and efficient manner and facilitate regional harmonization 
and coordination in the development of the mining sector; 

95.      In the electricity sector, reforms focus on restructuring the sector and restoring its financial 
viability based on the recommendations of audits financed by a LICUS TF grant. The plan includes: 
(i) streamlining the entities functioning in the electricity sector; (ii) transferring the sector’s assets to 

24 

 
SOGEPE’s accounts; (iii) strengthening the regulation of the electricity sector by changing the role 
and status of the regulatory agency, with the aim of developing its autonomy and granting it real 
regulatory authority; (iv) setting up a shared financial model and transparency in the tariff adjustment 
procedures; and (v) reviving rural electrification and accelerating improved access to energy, by 
establishing an entity dedicated to securing access to concessional funds and carbon financing. 

96.      In the financial services sector, reforms will focus on i) developing an action plan for 
financial stabilization, including banks and microfinance restructuring; and (ii) reforms aimed at 
improving access to financial services (for small and medium sized enterprises, rural zones, long-
term resources), including supply-side measures (new instruments, institutions, mechanisms) and 
demand-side measures (improvement in the transparency of the companies, including through 
reliable financial statements); iii) restructuring the microfinance sector, on the basis of the national 
microfinance sector strategy which has been approved by the Cabinet. Particular attention will be 
given to the national microcredit network UNACOOPEC (the National Union of Savings and Credit 
Cooperatives) to restore its net worth through intensive loan recovery; and iv) reforms in the 
Government employee pension fund to contain the growth of its structural deficit, which remained at 
0.5 percent of GDP in 2007. 

97.      Collaboration with IFC: IFC investments and corporate governance and risk management 
advisory services will potentially complement these reforms with additional capital for banks and 
tailored technical assistance to select banks. 

Institutional strengthening and capacity building 

98.      In addition to the institutional strengthening activities discussed above, the Bank will 
support efforts to strengthen institutions and build capacity as part of project design in all IDA 
investment and TA operations. As an example, the proposed Agriculture Export Promotion 
Operation and the regional WAAPP2 will include institution-building components for the National 
Agency to Support Rural Development and the National Center for Agronomic Research. IDF grants 
to strengthen the capacity of governance institutions responsible for policy in extractive industries 
and 
for parliament are other examples. The EFA-FTI program also 
includes a 
governance/institutional capacity development component. These are but a few examples. 

99.      WBI will also address institutional capacity gaps through its leadership for results programs 
and support for multi-stakeholder coalitions for reform (public/private sectors, civil society, 
parliamentarians, and media). WBI will help identify and build capacity of local training institutions.

100.      Supporting prospects for sustainable peace.  The Crisis Recovery Program is supported by a 
number of multilateral and bilateral donors, including the EU, UNDP, UNICEF, UNFPA, Japan, 
France, Belgium, Denmark, Norway and Sweden. The EU is taking the lead in supporting 
implementation of the OPA, including election support and the national identification and voter 
registration process.   

101.      PFM and economic governance of key sectors. The EU, IMF, AfDB, UN and some bilateral 
donors are Bank Group partners involved in strengthening PFM and governance in key economic 
sectors. The EU is funding PFM and electricity sector reforms and investments, as well as reforms in 
cocoa, cotton, wood and hydrocarbons. In the mining sector, UNDP, Canada, Germany, and FAC 
have provided support to the geological/geophysical cartography program. 

102.      The IMF is taking the lead to support revenue mobilization as a complement to the efforts on 
public expenditure management. Government measures to improve revenue collection include: 
(i) improving tax and customs administration, including in the North; (ii) enhancing the revenue 
contribution from national oil/gas companies; (iii) reducing tax exemptions; and (iv) ensuring that 
public enterprises transfer to the treasury all social contributions on wages.

Pillar 1 Risks 

103.      Country context: The political situation remains fragile and some important actions of the 
OPA stalled, such as disarmament and integrating FN into the national army. Based on performance 
since 2007, progress on these is likely to remain slow leading up to presidential elections. The main 
political party leaders have pledged to form a coalition government should they be elected president 
and this power-sharing arrangement should help mitigate the potential for significant disruption 
based on election results.  The risks for Côte d’Ivoire are also significant if government does not stay 
on track with its macroeconomic program and governance reforms, which would delay HIPC 
completion point, the reengagement of other development partners offering significant levels of 
financing, the return of private sector investors to the country, and economic recovery in general. 
Global context: The global economic recession could further impact the macroeconomic outlook by 
further dampening foreign direct investment and other capital flows necessary to rebuild the 
economy. Commodity prices have also been affected which has had an impact locally. 

104.      Should a situation occur wherein Government is unable to support or implement the proposed 
CPS investments or there is significant slippage in its reform program, staff will consult with 
government, key development partners and regional institutions to agree on how best to adjust the 
Bank program. In the absence of a Government or legitimate interlocutor, the Bank would assess 
options for continuing to support delivery of critical basic services to communities at the local level 
through alternative implementing mechanisms, including through NGOs. 

P illa r 2: Imp r ovin g t h e P er for ma n ce of t h e Agr icu lt u r e Sect or 

105.      Under this pillar, the Bank will support the agriculture and rural development objectives of 
the PRSP’s second Strategic Outcome by focusing on improving productivity and revenue potential 
and increasing food self-sufficiency; and by restoring basic services and income generating activities 
in rural areas. The Bank will also support the environmental objectives of the PRSP’s third Strategic 
Outcome (Social Well-Being of All) by helping mitigate the impact of economic activities on the 
environment. IFC investments in agribusiness would also contribute to results under this pillar. 

Expected CPS Outcomes: 
2.1 Increased productivity and value addition of export and food crops 
2.2 Increased rural incomes 
2.3 Strengthened protection of the environment and natural resources 

106.      CPS Outcome 2.1: Increased productivity and value addition of export and food crops. 
Côte d’Ivoire is preparing a National Program for Agriculture Investments which will present a 
comprehensive strategy for the rural and agriculture sectors and help guide efforts to improve the 
value-added and quantity of export crops; increase productivity of food crops such as rice; and 
restore disrupted supply chains for important pro-poor crops such as cotton. A series of policy notes 
in FY10 and FY11 will analyze the main sources of growth for Côte d’Ivoire and will emphasize the 
agriculture sector with an analysis of the value chain of traditional and emerging commodities and 
their market potential.  The policy notes will expand on recent work on cotton and cashew nuts, by 
focusing on oil palm, rubber, tropical fruits, coffee and rice.  A LICUS-financed Youth Employment 
Creation Project (FY08) has been supporting the development of the cashew nuts and rubber value 

27 

 
chains. For the cocoa sector, the Bank will continue to press for reforms through its dialogue and 
budget support programs for increased investments and international competitiveness, as well to 
support analytical work on domestic marketing. 

Box 5: Cocoa Reforms to Strengthen Governance and Productivity, Reduce Poverty 

Approximately 700,000 small holder families (about 4 million people) depend on the cocoa sector for their 
main source of income. However, inadequate producer incentives and poor management of the sector’s agencies 
have limited cocoa’s contribution to rural growth and poverty reduction. Between 2001 and 2007, it is estimated that 
a staggering CFAF3.2 trillion (US$6.4 billion equivalent) were extracted from the sector as fiscal (US$5.0 billion) 
and quasi fiscal levies (US$1.4 billion) and only a modest share, 35 to 40 percent of the CIF price (the world market 
price), went to farmers.  As a result, roughly 60 percent of cocoa growers now live below the poverty line according 
to the PRSP, and these households accounted for some 28 percent of the poor nation-wide. 

The Bank is supporting the Government’s comprehensive cocoa sector reform program, initiated in 2008, to 
achieve outcomes under CPS Pillars 1 and 2. The authorities took initial steps to streamline cocoa sector 
management by: (i) gradually reducing quasi-fiscal levies from CFAF53.15/kg for the 2005/06 season to 
CFAF46.46/kg for 2007/08 and to CFAF31.26/kg for 2008/09; (ii) channeling part of the quasi-fiscal levies to a 
rural investment fund (FIMR), established to help finance rural infrastructure (feeder roads, water supply, schools 
and health centers) to benefit cocoa farmers; (iii) improving sector transparency and financial management, by 
allocating the component of the quasi-fiscal levies allocated to a fund for investments in the sector, with improved 
reporting requirements; and  (iv) creating a Cocoa/Coffee Committee in February 2006 to review and monitor 
programs and projects financed with the bulk of these levies, and report to the Ministers concerned; and (v) 
communicating the budgets for key cocoa entities for 2007 and extracts from their accounts certified and closed for 
2006 to the Cabinet, the IMF and the World Bank and making them public.  Efforts to reform the institutional 
framework of the cocoa sector and define broader reform measures have also been strengthened.  In September 
2008, the Government placed the four cocoa entities under a transitional Management Committee for Cocoa and 
Coffee to handle the 2008/09 and 2009/2010 campaigns, rationalize the four entities, and reduce their operating 
expenses.  This committee developed a program of short-term actions to improve the quality and quantity of 
production, under which urgent investments are already being initiated, with the overall two-year program being 
finalized.  A second committee established in 2009 is focused on longer-term reform of the cocoa sector and 
proposing to Government the main axes of reform regarding productivity, marketing (domestic/external), domestic 
transformation, financing,  institutional set-up, and environmental and social sustainability. The committee is 
preparing a Cocoa Sector Development Strategy that will clearly define (i) the Government’s responsibilities and 
limits in the management of the sector; (ii) build a viable ‘inter-profession,’ enabling transparent management by the 
stakeholders of the sector’s common goods (pricing, policy, research, quality, traceability including for social 
issues); (iii) increase competition in marketing; (iv) introduce marked-based instruments for managing risk, in 
particular at the farmer level; (v) promote economically efficient local transformation of the cocoa bean into higher 
value added products; (vi) promote environmentally sustainable rehabilitation of ageing orchards; and (vii) improve 
quality. Government is also dealing with the inadequacies of farmer representation by supporting a comprehensive 
census of cocoa farmers which will enable the election of leaders to represent farmers and be accountable to them.  

Further reducing taxation to no more than 22 percent of the CIF price is a HIPC Completion Point trigger to bring 
Côte d’Ivoire further in line with the practice of other major cocoa exporters and help improve rural incomes.  Côte 
d’Ivoire has also agreed to convert to ad valorem taxes which will help ensure that the impact of any decline in the 
international price does not fall exclusively on the producers.  

107.      The Sources of Growth Policy Notes and the policy dialogue will provide the underpinning 
for the Government’s medium-term growth strategy and for proposed IDA investment operations 
focused on Agricultural Productivity and Export Promotion (FY12) and Growth and Competitiveness 

28 

 
 
(FY13), which together will support this outcome. Bank experience with several successful projects 
in the sub-region that support diversification and commercialization of agriculture gives it a 
comparative advantage in this area. As in other similar operations, the Agricultural Productivity 
project would be designed to promote women’s participation.  

108.      In FY10, Côte d’Ivoire is scheduled to begin participating in the second phase of the West 
African Agricultural Productivity Project (WAAPP B2), which focuses on regional collaboration in 
agricultural research, technology generation and dissemination. This project supports countries in 
those areas where they have a comparative advantage, while benefiting from research results on other 
food staples or agriculture products undertaken by other countries. The project will support improved 
productivity of Côte d’Ivoire’s banana plantain and other selected crops. Côte d’Ivoire may also be 
eligible to benefit from an ECOWAS initiative on developing regional agricultural value chains and 
markets. 

109.      Collaboration with IFC: WBI and IFC are exploring options for coordinated support to the 
cocoa sector. IFC is investigating opportunities to encourage sustainable private sector investments 
with a focus on export commodities and their supply chains; primarily in cocoa, rubber, fruits and 
vegetables, and non-traditional crops like cashew nuts.  IFC will also focus on food security and 
opportunities for viable investment in rice cultivation and milling. 

110.      CPS Outcome 2.2: Increased rural incomes.  To support this outcome the Bank and IMF 
will continue to press for reforms in the cocoa sector aimed at maximizing farmer incomes, a HIPC 
Completion Point trigger, as discussed in Box 5. Improved productivity of commodity and food 
crops resulting from the WAAPP activities will also support this outcome. Based on the experiences 
of the PNGTER, which financed work to survey and delineate land to clarify land ownership,  the 
Bank could eventually support efforts on land reform but would need to first do a stocktaking of the 
decentralization process and ensure there is in-country consensus on how to approach these reforms. 
A proposed IDA operation in FY13 would promote Côte d’Ivoire’s stalled decentralization process, 
focusing on local development and financing of social and economic infrastructure investment to 
promote rural livelihoods, whether on- or off-farm. This operation would be designed to promote 
women’s participation in income-generating activities and access to basic services. 

111.      In the area of marine fisheries resources, the Bank has launched, together with other 
development partners, a cooperative initiative aimed at increasing the overall value of the marine 
fisheries resources in West Africa by strengthening governance of the sector and increasing the 
profitability and local value added of the fish products originating from the region’s waters. Côte 
d’Ivoire is eligible to participate in the project. 

CPS Outcome 2.3: Strengthened protection of the environment and natural resources. A post-
conflict Country Environmental Assessment (CEA) prepared in FY09 proposes future interventions 
to support this outcome including: developing an action plan for the forestry sector; establishing a 
national environmental information system; reviewing the legal and institutional frameworks for 
waste management and atmospheric pollution; establishing a program for the sustainable 
management of the national parks; and assisting efforts to improve the environmental governance 
mechanism and environmental impact assessment system. The Bank’s financing support for this 
outcome will primarily be through a GEF Protected Area Project (PARC CI) approved in FY09 is 
financing activities to improve the sustainable management of the fauna and habitat of the Comoé 
National Park, one of two major park systems in the country. IDA investments in urban infrastructure 
rehabilitation are also improving the environment in cities and towns.

Development partners 

112.      The CPS period will see reengagement of several donors in the agriculture sector, which 
presents an opportunity for increased donor coordination. During the crisis, the EU and GTZ were 
the only two active donors. The Bank organized a multi-donor review mission for agriculture in 
February 2009 which offered a general appreciation of the problems and opportunities in the sector. 
The EU is unlikely to invest heavily in the sector.  The French Agency for Development (AFD) is 
expected to intervene significantly in the sector when it reengages. The International Fund for 
Agricultural Development (IFAD) has re-engaged, and is likely to co-finance IDA investments. The 
West and Central African Council for Agricultural Research and Development (CORAF), is a key 
partner, implementing the WAAPP. The EU is taking the lead on the land reform agenda and the 
Bank will examine how it can best contribute to those efforts beyond the PNGTER which closes in 
2010. 

113.      Germany is a lead donor on environment and is financing projects in the Tai National Park in 
the southwest, as well as a program on the development and stabilization of agricultural systems and 
forestry. A number of other bilateral partners (Belgium, China, Canada, Switzerland and the US) and 
multilaterals (UNDP, UNEP, FAO, EU and AfDB) also support activities in environmental and 
natural resources management in Côte d’Ivoire, though on a small scale. Areas of intervention 
include bio-safety, climate change, rural development, biodiversity, small-scale environmental 
projects, forestry, and fisheries.  

Pillar 2 Risks 

114.      Country Context: Any significant political or social disturbances or delay in consolidating 
the redeployment of the public administration in the CNW is a risk to normalizing basic services and 
economic activities, notably in this region.  Lack of progress on reforms that are linked to the 
activities supported under this pillar could also pose a risk. In addition to the efforts under Pillar 1 to 
help consolidate peace and crisis recovery, the EGRG series supports reforms linked to achieving 
objectives of activities under this pillar. This includes supporting further improvements in the 

30 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
management of the cocoa sector, farmers’ share of revenues and the performance of the agriculture 
sector. 

115.      Global Context: Any significant changes in commodity prices could be a risk to Pillar 2 
objectives; however, the country’s relatively diverse economic base should help to offset this impact.   

P illa r 3:  St r en g th en in g t h e P r iva t e Sect or 

116.      Under this pillar, the Bank will support the private sector objectives of the PRSP’s second 
Strategic Outcome by providing support to small and medium enterprises, promoting reforms that 
improve the business environment and strengthening competitiveness. 

117.      The IFC will also support outcomes under this pillar to help improve the country’s business 
environment to reduce the high cost of doing business, and forge partnership with local banks to 
improve access to finance for SMEs. 

Expected CPS Outcomes: 

3.1  Improved performance of entrepreneurs and small businesses 
3.2 An improved business environment and more competitive economy 

118.      CPS Outcome 3.1. Improved performance of entrepreneurs and small businesses:  In 
FY10, the Bank will continue to undertake informal analytical work and provide technical assistance 
in support of SMEs, including to improve access to financing and to better understand how to 
improve the business environment. The Post-Conflict Private Sector Assessment (FY10) is a key 
analytical input.  The Bank will also promote entrepreneurship through policy reforms that will be 
introduced in the DPO or PRSG series, and through the SME Revitalization and Governance Project 
(FY10) and a Growth and Competitiveness Operation (FY13). The SME operation is supporting 
clearance of government arrears to SMEs and access to financing to help recapitalize them. In 
addition, the project includes a matching grant program to support training and build-capacity of 
SMEs. A minimum of 35 percent of participants in the matching grant program are expected to be 
women, based on previous experience. With financing from the SPF, the Bank is piloting a Young 
Entrepreneurs and Urban Job Creation grant (FY09) using a business competition model to help 
young entrepreneurs prepare bankable projects and find private sector support to launch and operate 
their business. The project is designed to promote the participation of women and reach a target of 50 
percent by providing services such as childcare, including a focus on gender issues in a market study 
to define sectors that will be promoted, and training trainers in gender awareness and promotion. 

119.      The Growth and Competitiveness Operation (FY13) could support facilities to expand access 
to finance through local intermediaries and regional initiatives.  Côte d’Ivoire is also eligible to join 
the Africa Trade Insurance (ATI) Agency, a regional facility set up with IDA support, providing 
export credit and risk coverage. Côte d’Ivoire and other West and Central African countries are 
currently considering membership to this initiative which would foster the development of regional 
trade and investment, with support of IDA and AfDB. 

120.      As a complement to these national efforts, Côte d’Ivoire will benefit from a WAEMU 
regional initiative supported by the Bank that aims to strengthen accounting and auditing 

31 

 
 
professionals in member countries and compliance with international standards on accounting and 
auditing  to improve corporate financial reporting. 

121.      CPS Outcome 3.2. An improved business environment and more competitive economy: 
Based on the FIAS “Doing Business Memo” (FY09), the ROSC Accounting and Auditing review, 
and private sector TA provided by IDA in FY09, the Bank Group and public and private sector 
stakeholders have agreed on immediate priorities for strengthening governance of the business 
environment. Some of these recommendations are being supported by the IDA SME Revitalization 
and Governance Project (FY10), including: establishing a one-stop shop to simplify the procedures 
for creating businesses and a Pilot Commercial Court in Abidjan; strengthening the Business and 
Collateral Registry (RCCM), and supporting a pilot program to end racketeering. The joint IMF-
World Bank Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) prepared in FY09 identified priorities to 
strengthen the financial sector to also improve the business environment.  Follow-up on the FSAP 
recommendations are being supported by the DPO series. An IDF Grant to support the 
implementation of the ROSC Accounting and Auditing will also support the improvement of the 
financial information practices of the private sector.  

122.      Collaboration with IFC: IFC will focus on linking advisory services and financing 
instruments to expand access to finance for SMEs through the banking system, and strengthen the 
financial sector generally, including the microfinance sector. 

123.      Through a proposed Public-Private Partnership (PPP) TA (FY10/11) the Bank will help 
strengthen the institutional, legal and regulatory environment for private sector involvement in the 
delivery of public services. The TA will also help frame a PPP program involving innovative 
infrastructure financing and risk-allocation mechanisms to scale up investment and service 
delivery—thereby contributing to strengthening economic competitiveness.  Reforms to improve the 
business environment will help Côte d’Ivoire’s economy become more competitive during the CPS 
period. The Policy Notes on Sources of Growth (FY11) and the Private Sector Assessment (FY10) 
will be key inputs for prioritizing reforms and future investments to promote competitiveness.  The 
proposed Economic Infrastructure Renewal Operation (FY13) would focus on strengthening major 
infrastructure services, such as ports, that would make the country significantly more competitive 
regionally. 

124.      The 2009 ROSC Auditing and Accounting revealed significant weaknesses in accounting and 
auditing practices of the private sector. The Bank will help the government implement the ROSC 
A&A action plan in FY11 to help business improve financial reporting. 

125.      In addition, Côte d’Ivoire is eligible to participate in the WAEMU Capital Market 
development Project which provides technical assistance to the regulator of the regional capital 
market, the stock exchange and the WAEMU Commission to (i) improve the regulatory framework 
for the equity and bond markets, (ii) introduce a credit rating system for issuers (iii) define and 
implement new guidelines for institutions involved in the regional capital markets, including the 
definition of new prudential norms, accounting systems in compliance with international standards; 
(iv) define a code of conduct for the CREPMF; (v) develop a legal framework for mortgage 
refinancing and securitization and; (v) harmonize the tax regimes across the region for medium-term 
bonds and other financial or capital market instruments that would result in a more efficient regional 
capital market. The Bank is also planning to support implementation of improvements of the legal 
and regulatory framework under which business is conducted in Côte d’Ivoire as part of the 
modernization of OHADA Uniform Acts.

*Some operations are not yet defined or will be prepared in outer years and influence results under the next CPS. 

Development partners 

126.      The EU, French Cooperation and UNDP are providing support to SMEs and youth 
employment.  GTZ, with EU and World Bank financing, is also implementing activities in labor-
intensive public works and reintegration of ex-combatants and youth employment. The EU is also co-
financing activities to improve the investment climate by strengthening governance. 

Pillar 3 Risks 

127.      Country Context: Any significant political or social disturbances or any slippage in reforms 
linked to this pillar pose a risk.  In addition to the efforts under Pillar 1 to help consolidate peace and 
crisis recovery, development policy operations are being designed to support specific reforms linked 
to achieving objectives of activities under this pillar. For example, clearance of government arrears to 
domestic businesses and service providers is fundamental to private sector recovery. Bank support to 
ensure adequate fiscal space for government to implement its budget and PFM reforms will also help 
reduce risk of new arrears. The uncertain political environment will continue to dampen confidence 
of foreign investors. 

128.      Global context:  The global recession has dampened foreign direct investments and will 
delay how quickly investors will return to the country and subsequently the level of private sector 
and job growth.  Political normalization and improvements in the investment climate would help to 
offset this. 

P illa r 4: I n fr a st r u ct u r e R en ewa l a n d B a sic Ser vices 

129.      Under this pillar, the Bank will support the infrastructure objectives of the PRSP’s second 
and third Strategic Outcomes by helping rehabilitate infrastructure to boost economic activity and 

33 

 
 
 
 
 
basic services to improve the quality of life in urban and rural areas; and by strengthening the 
institutional capacity to manage and maintain these services.  IFC and MIGA are also planning to 
make investments or underwrite investments that would contribute to the outcomes under this pillar. 

Expected CPS Outcomes: 

4.1. Essential basic infrastructure is rehabilitated, expanded or upgraded  
4.2. Safer and cleaner urban and rural living conditions 
4.3. Improved access to basic social services 

130.      CPS Outcome 4.1: Essential basic infrastructure is rehabilitated, expanded or 
upgraded. This outcome will be supported through operations in a number of sectors, namely 
transport, electricity, water and sanitation, and urban infrastructure services. 

131.      Transport:  The Transport Sector Adjustment Operation (CI-PAST, reactivated in FY08) and 
a regional Abidjan-Lagos Trade and Transport Facilitation Project (FY11) are the main instruments 
to support outcomes in this sector. Under CI-PAST, activities will include: (i) safeguarding the 
existing transport infrastructure network; (ii) improving the urban transport system in Abidjan by 
developing a comprehensive Bus Rapid Transport (BRT) including the existing system (SOTRA), 
railway and boats; and (iii) building capacity in the transport sector to support the decentralization of 
the road management. The Government is preparing a National Transport Strategy for the next two 
decades with support from PPIAF.  The strategy will cover all modes of transports (roads, railways, 
port, aviation, urban and rural transport), propose an investment program and identify sources of 
financing, in addition to the Road Maintenance Funds. 

132.      Côte d’Ivoire will join the 2nd phase of the regional Abidjan-Lagos Trade and Transport 
Facilitation Project in FY11. The project will help reduce barriers to trade and transport along the 
corridor by improving road conditions, modernizing customs procedures and coordination, and 
reducing roadblocks. The Bank also envisages supporting the development of the Abidjan-
Ouagadougou-Niamey road/rail intermodal corridor to improve access to the sea by the Burkina and 
Niger. 

133.      The IDA Emergency Urban Infrastructure Project (FY08) is also supporting the transport 
sector and reducing congestion in urban areas by rehabilitating urban roads and connecting secondary 
streets to main roads; and building parking stations for buses and minibuses in Abidjan. IDA 
activities to strengthen governance in the transport sector, by countering racketeering under the SME 
Revitalization and Governance Project (FY10), and by strengthening the procurement system 
through the DPO series and IDA TA activities will also support this outcome. 

134.      Collaboration with MIGA: MIGA is expecting to provide a guarantee for investment in 

construction, operation, maintenance and transfer of the Riviera-Marcory Bridge in Abidjan, to help 

relieve congestion on the existing two bridges which are at full capacity. MIGA has also been 

approached for a guarantee for a future investment in the Sitarail transport projeoct. The 1,260 kilometer 
railway connects the port of Abidjan with Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. 

135.      Electricity: Under the Urgent Electricity Rehabilitation Project (UERP) approved in FY09, 
the Bank is financing the upgrading, expansion and restructuring of the distribution network in 
Abidjan and other urban areas to reduce losses and increase availability and security of power 

34 

 
 
 
supply. The project is also financing preparatory studies for priority generation and transmission 
projects as well as energy efficiency projects in order to bring them to a bankable level of quality, 
allowing the Government to catch up with demand growth and play its central role in the West 
African Power Pool. The Infrastructure Renewal Operation (FY12) may build upon the UERP 
activities. The Bank will also support efforts to extend electricity to rural areas by helping 
government strengthen the institutional arrangements to implement rural electrification projects, 
through PPPs and/or involvement of local communities. Côte d’Ivoire’s participation in the West 
Africa Power Pool Project (WAPP) will contribute to strengthening regional electricity services 
(namely the interconnections between Côte d’Ivoire and Mali, Burkina Faso and Liberia). 

136.      Collaboration with IFC and MIGA: The Government is also pursuing PPPs building on 
Côte d’Ivoire’s good experience with independent power producers, with the involvement of IDA, 
IFC and MIGA. The IFC is exploring the possibility of providing financing for the expansion of the 
Azito gas power station, one of two major projects to extend power generation of existing producers. 
IFC provided a LoI of US$100 million, consisting of 75 million USD debt and 25 million USD 
equity. IFC is also in discussions to support private sector participation in Soubré Hydropower plant.  
MIGA also plans to support the Azito expansion and Soubre greenfield hydropower. IDA will 
explore the possibility of providing partial risk guarantees to these projects. IDA will also provide 
TA to implement the measures included in the 2009 electricity policy letter and build capacity in 
power system planning with the objective of updating internally the Generation-Transmission Master 
Plan and define projects to tap a hydropower potential of 1,944 MW. These investments will all have 
regional significance for the West African Power Pool beyond Côte d’Ivoire, but will be subject to 
adequate progress with sector reforms. 

137.      CPS Outcome 4.2. Safer and cleaner urban and rural living conditions:  This outcome 
will be supported by the Emergency Urban Infrastructure Project (PUIUR) financed by IDA (FY08) 
and topped-up with additional financing from the Crisis Response Window (FY10). The project is 
upgrading urban infrastructure in Abidjan and Bouaké, including water and sewerage services; waste 
removal; transport services; strengthening management capacity of municipalities; and promoting 
labor-intensive public works to employ the urban poor.  The project is also rehabilitating and 
extending the drainage system in the city of Abidjan to reduce flooding. Support for solid waste 
collection in Abidjan includes development of two controlled landfill sites for solid waste disposal. 
Land and housing development will make it possible to relocate poor families who live in flood-
prone areas of Abidjan. The project will also support rehabilitation and completion of works in poor 
crowded neighborhoods that were begun under a previous IDA financed operation. With the 
additional resources from the CRW, the PUIUR is extending its activities to additional poor 
neighborhoods in Abidjan, Bouake, Bonoua and Korhogo, to cities and towns located in the south, 
center and north of the country.  The Government is preparing a solid waste management strategy 
with financing from PPIAF. 

138.      The PCAP and CI-PAST are also supporting efforts to rehabilitate infrastructure and restore 
basic services in rural areas. The proposed Infrastructure Renewal Operation (FY12) would also 
extend or expand the activities of the PUIUR. 

139.      CPS Outcome 4.3. Improved access to basic services:  This outcome is supported by 
reforms under the DPO and Enhanced HIPC Initiative to strengthen budgetary allocations to social 
sectors, as well as by IDA investment operations and analytical work. 

35 

 
140.      Education: The Bank will continue to implement the Basic Education Project (PASEF) 
which is financing the rehabilitation of schools, provision of school books and teacher training to 
improve access and quality of basic education services.  The Bank will administer the Education For 
All-Fast Track Initiative (EFA-FTI), expected to begin in FY11. The program emphasizes universal 
access to primary education and girls’ education to support achievement of the education MDGs. The 
2009 Education Country Status Report prepared jointly by Government, development partners and 
IDA provides the analytical underpinning for the sector.  

141.      HIV/AIDS and Health:  The IDA-financed Emergency Multi-Sector HIV/AIDS Project 
(FY08) is the main Bank instrument supporting the government’s response to the pandemic, in 
coordination with USAID and the Global Fund. The project is supporting the delivery of essential 
services for the prevention, care and treatment of STDs, TB and HIV/AIDS. The Bank will support 
basic health services at the local level through community rehabilitation activities of the PCAP and 
the proposed Decentralization and Local Development operation (FY12). These activities will 
support basic health services until the Bank and donors can evaluate how best to intervene on the 
basis of the Bank-financed Health Country Status Report (FY10), prepared jointly with USAID and 
WHO, to help Côte d’Ivoire achieve the health MDGs.   

142.      Social safety nets. The PASEF was restructured to include a school feeding component in 
response to the food price crisis in FY09.  The experience of labor intensive public works under 
PCAP will be harnessed to possibly establish a workfare program for youth under the proposed 
Employment and Training Opportunities for Youth project. 

143.      A Poverty Assessment in FY10 and a Gender Assessment in FY12 will update knowledge on 
poverty and gender and provide additional information to help guide Government and international 
partners on priorities for reducing poverty, improve women’s economic opportunities and status, and 
better targeting services to the poorest communities. These studies will also assess issues related to 
IDPs, the majority of whom are women and children, and recommend how to support and help 
reintegrate these families. The Poverty Assessment report will also include a chapter on formal safety 
nets to help identify gaps and inefficiencies in the present system.  At the same time, a study on 
informal safety nets is being conducted as part of a regional study.

Development partners: 

144.      Transport. The EU is a leading development partner in the transport sector with three 
ongoing projects for rural roads, including in cotton growing areas. The EU is also preparing 
feasibility studies for interstate highways between Côte d’Ivoire and its neighboring countries. The 
West African Development Bank (BOAD) is involved in bridge construction in Abidjan, road 
construction between Côte d’Ivoire and Mali, and extending the Abidjan-Yamoussoukro Highway, 
with other donors. AfDB is interested in supporting the development of the San Pedro port.  

145.      Energy: The EU is the only active development partner in the energy sector and is funding an 
on-going project to improve distribution in Abidjan and Bouaké. The AfDB’s main investments in its 
2009-2010 country strategy for regional energy infrastructure, including studies for the FOMI 
Hydroelectric Dam and related transmission lines (covering Guinea, Mali and Côte d’Ivoire) and 
financing a multi-national (Côte d’Ivoire-Mali). The EIB is financing pre-investment studies for 
interconnection projects involving Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Sierra Leone and Guinea in the framework 
of the WAPP with the objective of co-financing with World Bank and other donors. 

37 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
146.      Urban and Water: The EU is supporting urban and water infrastructure under two 
decentralization programs in coastal towns and urban centers, including San Pedro, Daloa, Bouaké, 
Odienné, Korhogo and Bondoukou; and a program of emergency post-crisis infrastructure 
rehabilitation projects. Belgium, France, Germany and the US also have projects to support local 
infrastructure in urban and rural areas. 

147.      Education. AFD, UNESCO-BREDA, and UNICEF are working jointly with the Bank on a 
coordinated approach to improve services.  AFD will reengage fully with Côte d’Ivoire once its 
arrears are cleared, at which point it plans significant investments in the sector. Development 
partners are also harmonizing their support for education through the EFA-FTI multi-donor trust fund 
which the Bank will administer. 

148.      Health and HIV/AIDS. Donors are mainly carrying out analytical activities to identify and 
plan their programs for the next 3 or 5 years.  The Bank is supporting this process through the 
preparation of the Health Country Status Report (FY10) and a comprehensive survey of health 
facilities, in coordination with USAID and WHO. The US supports the fight against HIV/AIDS 
through the PEPFAR program which covers nearly 70 percent of the country. The Global Fund and 
the World Bank are covering 15 percent; and UN agencies and international NGO covering about 5 
to 10 percent of the country. Social safety nets. The European Union and WFP support a school 
feeding program that is showing promising results. GTZ is implementing LIPW financed by the 
World Bank. 

Pillar 4 Risks 

149.      The most critical aspect concerning risks under Pillar 4 is to ensure that basic infrastructure 
and social services are designed to reduce disparities between the South and the CNW, which is 
significantly more disadvantaged.  At the same time, activities are likely to be more concentrated in 
the South and Center given the larger population centers.  Operations under Pillar 4 will continue to 
take into account these issues to contribute to the first Outcome under Pillar 1, “Continued progress 
toward crisis recovery and consolidating peace.” 

150.      Any significant political or social disturbances or any slippage in reforms linked to this pillar 
pose a risk.  In addition to the efforts under Pillar 1 to help consolidate peace, development policy 
operations are being designed to support reforms linked to achieving objectives of activities under 
this pillar, by ensuring that there is adequate fiscal space for government to operate basic services 
and implement its investment program, and for public resources to be allocated to pro-poor priorities 
consistent with the PRSP. In addition, the DPO and PRSG series could support reforms to ensure 
infrastructure programs include provisions for maintenance to ensure their sustainability.

Expected CPS Cross-Cutting Outcomes: 

5.1 Job creation with special attention to youth 
5.2: Mainstreaming gender and improving women’s economic opportunities 
151.      CPS Cross-Cutting Outcome 5.1. Job creation with special attention to youth:   Several 
operations will focus specifically on creating employment, both short-term and more sustainable 
jobs. Labor intensive public works supported by investments under Pillar 1, such as the PCAP, 
include a focus on emergency employment. Activities under Pillar 2 will focus on strengthening the 
private sector and opportunities for longer-term job creation. The proposed Employment and 
Training Opportunities for Youth (FY11) is expected to focus on LIPWs, like the PCAP, as well as 
more sustainable employment, and will be designed to promote the equal participation of women.  
The Young Entrepreneurs and Urban Job Creation grant (FY10) financed by the SPF is designed to 
train and mentor young entrepreneurs to help them launch sustainable new businesses.  The Bank’s 
investments to improve the performance of agricultural products are intended to not only create jobs 
but also wealth from increased revenue and trade opportunities. Likewise, investments in 
infrastructure under Pillar 4 seek to create employment opportunities for contractors and thousands of 
workers, and investments in education and training seek to strengthen the employment perspectives 
of upcoming generations.  Through these activities, the Bank is laying the groundwork for a long-
term engagement in support of job creation in the country. 

152.      CPS Cross-Cutting Outcome 5.2: Mainstreaming gender and improving women’s 
economic opportunities.  The CPS program offers the Bank an opportunity to mainstream gender in 
its approach to reducing poverty and inequality and promoting growth.  The Poverty Assessment in 
FY10 and a Gender Assessment in FY12 are the main analytical instruments that will look at gender 
and poverty issues, including assessing opportunities for promoting women’s economic participation 
and their status in society. 

153.      Bank activities under each of the 4 pillars also include components to promote 
opportunities for women or reduce their economic and physical vulnerabilities.  Under Pillar 1, 
outreach to civil society to strengthen demand-side governance includes work with women’s 
associations to increase their voice and participation in monitoring the government’s reform program.  
Activities under the Protection from Gender-Based Violence SPF grant are helping combat sexual 
exploitation of girls in schools, raise awareness of girls and women’s rights, and support women’s 
savings cooperatives to promote income-generating activities.  The LICUS Youth Employment 
promotes the participation of women as leaders of working brigades in LIPWs. Under Pillar 2, the 
WAAPP will seek to ensure that a minimum of 50,000 women in participating countries benefit from 
improved agriculture technology during the CPS period. Under Pillar 3, The Young Entrepreneurs 
and Urban Job Creation Grant is designed to promote the participation of women, by providing 
childcare services during training workshops and training trainers in gender awareness. Under Pillar 
4, support to education promotes increased access to school for girls to help attain the gender parity 
in education MDG. The PASEF is supporting literacy programs for 3,000 adults, of which 75 percent 
are women. The HIV/AIDS project is particularly important for women given the “feminization” of 
the disease, with prevalence rates estimated at 6.7 percent for women compared to 2.9 percent for 
men, according to the PRSP.  

39 

 
J. Instruments to Implement the CPS  

154.      The Bank instruments to implement this strategy will include a blend of IDA policy-
based and investment operations; GEF trust funds, and other trust funds administered or 
funded by the World Bank, as well as analytic and advisory services (Tables 8 and 9).  Côte 
d’Ivoire will also participate in regional IDA operations.  Through IDA, the Bank is expected to 
finance up to 9 new operations—up to five new investment operations and four budget support 
operations. In addition, the Bank will finance three to five regional operations that involve Côte 
d’Ivoire. IFC will provide financing to the private sector, combined with advisory services to both 
the public and private sectors; and MIGA will support foreign investments in key sectors by 
providing political risk guarantees. 

155.      Côte d’Ivoire will continue to benefit from exceptional post-conflict IDA allocations 
during the CPS period, FY10-FY13, which overlaps IDA15 and IDA16 replenishment periods. 
Indicative IDA allocations to support the CPS would total SDR 277 million.  Indicative allocations 
for the rest of IDA15 would total SDR 137 million, comprising a firm allocation of SDR 91.5 million 
in FY10 and an indicative allocation of SDR 45.6 million in FY11, taking FY09 front-loading into 
account.  As the exceptional post-conflict IDA allocations in effect for Côte d’Ivoire since FY08 will 
begin to decline gradually in FY12, indicative allocations during FY12-FY13 are estimated at about 
SDR 70 million per annum.  Actual IDA allocations during the CPS period will be determined on a 
yearly basis and will depend on: (i) total IDA resources available; (ii) the country’s performance 
rating -- based on Post-Conflict Performance Indicators and portfolio performance; (iii) performance 
of other IDA borrowers; (iv) the terms of IDA assistance to Côte d’Ivoire, whether credits or grants; 
and (v) number of IDA-eligible countries. 

156.      In February 2010, SDR 19.2 (US$30) million was approved for Cote d’Ivoire from stage 
1 of the Crisis Response Window (CRW) allocations.  Additional allocations have been requested 
from stage II CRW and from unused IDA funds. The CRW funds would be utilized to top-up budget 
support and basic services operations and would help mitigate the social and fiscal impact of the 
global economic crisis, including covering reconstruction programs and ensuring the delivery of 
basic infrastructure services for the hardest hit communities.  In addition, an amount of SDR 51 
(US$80) million from the Regional Projects envelope is expected to leverage proposed $40 million 
for three regional operations. This would bring total IDA financing for these projects to $120 million 
(each regional project is financed with 1/3 IDA country allocation and 2/3 IDA Regional envelope).

K. Partnerships and Aid Effectiveness 

157.      At the policy level, key donor partners coordinate around the international consultative 
body which is attached to the Ouagadougou process (comprising the UN, EU, IMF, AfDB and the 
World Bank) and monitors implementation progress and challenges. 

158.      At the technical level, donors coordinate according to sectors with the line ministries as 
well as by way of a regular Groupe de Réflexion Stratégique, comprising heads of UN agencies, 
key bilateral partners and the IFIs. The Bank and Fund coordinate closely on dialogue with 
authorities. 

159.      For 2008 and 2009, IDA was the largest donor to Côte d’Ivoire, with disbursements of 
$526 million; followed by the IMF, $361 million; The EC, $202 million; and AfDB, $131 million.  

160.      The EU’s program in Côte d’Ivoire is presented in a five-year strategy covering 2009-2013.  
In February 2009, the Bank signed a Protocol of Cooperation with the EU delegate in Abidjan 
outlining a World Bank-EU partnership for Côte d’Ivoire and establishing complementary roles for 
the two institutions as well as areas of collaboration over the next four years, including in the areas of 
i) Governance; ii) PSD; iii) health; iv) education; v) agriculture; and vi) infrastructure (roads and 
electricity).  The Bank is pursuing the same approach with other key donors once they fully 
reengage, notably AFD and AfDB. 

161.      The AFD will only be able to reengage in Côte d’Ivoire once the country reaches the HIPC 
Completion Point. At that time, they expect to develop programs for 1.8 to 2 billion Euros over a 
period of 10-15 years to recycle the debt relief to be provided under a program called C2D (Contrat 
Desendettement-Développement). AFD expects to focus on the private sector development agenda, in 
particular to revamp technical and vocational training.  AFD could also channel support to 
infrastructure and urban renewal programs to complement Bank efforts these areas.  AFD is 
considering support to the health sector in collaboration with other development partners. 

162.      The AfDB prepared a Global Country Strategy Note for 2009-2010 which laid out an arrears 
clearance plan for Côte d’Ivoire (cleared in early March 2009) and a reengagement strategy focused 
on strengthening economic governance and regional infrastructure (namely electricity and 
hydropower). 

163.      The UN System has a program covering 2009 to 2013 focused on five themes: Consolidating 
peace and protecting human rights; governance and decentralization; basic social services; economic 
recovery and food security; and the environment. The UN has provided support for the preparation of 
the PRSP and works closely with development partners, including the World Bank and IMF, to 
promote coherence and harmonization. See Annex 3 on estimated donor support for PRSP sectors. 

164.      The Bank plans to work with Government to organize and sponsor a Consultative 
Group meeting to mobilize and coordinate donor support around the PRSP upon attainment of HIPC 
Completion Point. 

165.      Outside of financing operations, the Bank has also been strengthening partnerships 
with Côte d’Ivoire’s civil society and private sector through a “Dialogue Series on Development 
in Côte d’Ivoire.” This provides a forum for debate and exchanging views among community and 
national leaders on issues critical to recovery and peace-building efforts. The Country Office in 

42 

 
Abidjan is also implementing a communications and outreach program with a broad array of 
stakeholders to further support a peaceful and smooth political transition and economic recovery 
during and following the electoral period. These efforts seek to raise awareness and understanding of 
the objectives of the reform program on the part of public opinion leaders while also providing a 
platform for exchanging views on the country’s priorities. As part of this effort, the Bank prepared a 
CSO strategy which includes putting in place a network of CSOs representing a broad array of 
sectors with which the Bank will hold regular consultations on its programs. The country office has 
also launched a new quarterly magazine, “L’Espoir,” as part of its outreach effort. 

L. Monitoring and Evaluating CPS performance and results 

166.      Managing for Results.  The Bank’s objective is to contribute to Côte d’Ivoire’s higher-level 
goals as outlined in the PRSP. The Bank’s performance will be measured according to results 
obtainable during the CPS, mostly influenced by on-going operations or those prepared within the 
first two years of the CPS period. Annex 1 provides the results matrix with the specific outcomes the 
Bank expects to influence through ongoing and planned operations and non-financial support. 

167.      During the CPS timeframe, macro-monitoring and PEMFAR updates will provide 
feedback on the effectiveness of targeted expenditures, identify bottlenecks in the flow of funds, 
including any misappropriations. Country Portfolio Performance Reviews will provide a forum for 
raising policy and implementation issues and agreeing with counterparts on how to address these 
issues. The Bank’s Implementation Supervision Reports (ISRs) and Implementation Completion and 
Results Reports (ICRs) are an important tool for M&E.  The Bank is coordinating with the PRSP 
Secretariat to have the PRSP monitoring committee also monitor CPS implementation. The PRSP 
monitoring committee includes central and local authorities as well as non-government actors (civil 
society, religious representatives, private sectors, academicians).   

168.      A CPS Progress Report will be prepared in FY12 to allow adjustments to be made to 
the strategy and to update indicators for the results matrix based on new knowledge, program 
performance or to reflect changing circumstances. A CPS Completion Report will be prepared in 
FY14 to evaluate the program’s performance. 

169.      Given the fragile country environment and the medium-term horizon of this strategy, 
the Bank will prepare a note for the Board on CPS implementation progress either following 
elections or after one year of implementation. Such a note would update the Board on status of the 
Bank program, prospects for continued implementation of the CPS, and make any recommendations 
for adjusting the Bank’s approach, if needed. 

VI. RISKS TO PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION AND 
MITIGATING MEASURES 

170.      In addition to the risks that have been detailed under each pillar of the CPS, several overall 
risks to the strategy are presented below, along with proposed mitigating measures: 

43 

 
 
171.      Risks related to elections and further delay with political normalization.  The political 
situation remains fragile with presidential elections still pending. Further delays in elections could 
create a risk to the CPS. Or, election results could be contested and disagreements poorly managed. 
This could destabilize the country and affect the prospects for further implementation of the OPA or 
implementation of the PRSP and reforms to attain HIPC Completion Point.  Such instability could 
also dampen growth prospects, which could reach a modest rate of 1-2 percent per year, driven 
mainly by oil production, and per capita incomes would likely fall. If IDA financing support were to 
be interrupted, the Bank would continue to work through the State and Peace-Building trust fund and 
would continue analytical work to maintain the knowledge base.  The possibility of a new incoming 
administration not supporting the reform program is mitigated by the fact that during the PRSP 
preparation, the Coalition Government garnered support across political parties for the PRSP and 
CPS, which were discussed and endorsed by different components of government and civil society. 
In this context, it is expected that an incoming administration following elections will continue to be 
broadly in line with the PRSP and the program supported by the CPS.  The Bank will continue to 
work closely with the authorities and development partners toward successful implementation of the 
OPA and Government’s reform program during this transition period. The Bank will continue to 
strengthen awareness among all key stakeholders of the reforms and investment programs supported 
by the CPS to encourage continued political commitment. 

172.      Should a situation occur wherein Government is incapable or unwilling to support or 
implement the proposed CPS investments or there is significant slippage in the reform program, staff 
will consult with government, key development partners and regional institutions to agree on how 
best to adjust the Bank program. In the absence of a Government or legitimate interlocutor, the Bank 
would assess options for continuing to support delivery of critical basic services to communities at 
the local level through alternative implementing mechanisms, such as NGOs. 

173.      Exogenous shocks and commodity price risks. The financial market turmoil and related 
global economic slowdown could also further dampen foreign direct investment and other capital 
flows necessary to rebuild the economy. They have also affected commodity prices for exports such 
as timber, rubber and oil palm. The price of oil fell by half from its peak in mid-2008, though it has 
since rebounded. Cocoa prices have also remained robust. However, a drop in oil and cocoa prices 
would reduce government revenue and the fiscal space for reconstruction spending. If cocoa and oil 
prices in 2009 were 30 percent below World Economic Outlook projections, Côte d’Ivoire’s growth 
would be 1-1.5 percentage points lower, and government revenue would fall by 0.4 percent of GDP. 
Together with any delays in moving to the HIPC Completion Point, this would raise the risk of 
renewed arrears. Government’s recent track record in macroeconomic management, the focus on 
growth enhancing structural reforms and support provided by donors will help mitigate the impact of 
exogenous shocks. The IMF and IDA will continue to closely monitor the Government’s 
macroeconomic performance. 

174.      Project management and fiduciary risks. To mitigate these risks, the Bank plans to provide 
training and undertake intensive implementation support missions to help build capacity and ensure 
adequate controls are in place for financial transactions and accuracy in financial reporting, audit and 
disbursement. These activities will apply to both investment operations and DPOs/PRSGs.  
Additional steps to mitigate project management and fiduciary risks are discussed in the section on 
Portfolio & Financial Management (see Section V. H).

Annex 2:  Results Under the Interim Strategy Note (FY08-09) 

• 

Since resuming IDA support in FY08, World Bank results in Côte d’Ivoire include: 
i. Stabilizing the situation and assisting Government to address key conflict factors 
• Economic reintegration services provided for 6,700 ex-combatants and youth-at-risk (including labor-
intensive jobs and training to help beneficiaries create self-employment). 

• 250,000 certificates/deeds (contained in 5,000 civil registries) have been salvaged, restored and 
digitized. Another 36,000,000 certificates/deeds (for 720,000 registries) will be digitized.  To 
accomplish this, civil registry offices have been equipped with new computerized systems to ensure 
that births, citizenship, property, marriage and other life events are properly recorded, stored and 
available for Government to provide adequate services to citizens.  
• The first ever National Civil Registry Archives is under construction to safeguard this information, 
and help to prevent recurrence of abuses which contributed to the outbreak of the civil war.   
• Offices for local government officials are also being rehabilitated to facilitate the redeployment of 
the civil service across the country as part of the reunification process.  
IDA is providing services to clarify land rights and facilitate conflict resolution and has provided 
protection and treatment to some 2,000 women survivors of gender-based violence. 
ii. Assisting war-affected populations 
• The IDA education project is printing 6.5 million text books for primary school students, 244,000 
teacher guides, and 87,000 teacher training guide for the 2010/011 school-year. In response to the 
food price crisis, the project provided school meals to 68,000 students in 400 schools in 2009, 
working with WFP. 
• 
IDA financed 50 community projects, of which 50% are health dispensaries and 50% schools 
• Transport infrastructure rehabilitation has included: spot improvements on 3,100kms of unpaved 
roads; rehabilitation of 578km of unpaved roads; rehabilitation of 134kms of paved road (Abidjan to 
San Pedro); construction of 50 small bridges across the country (ongoing) and completion of the 
Dihinibo bridge on the main road in the eastern region 
• The emergency urban infrastructure project has financed more than 1,200 direct jobs with 60 local 
contractors for rehabilitation works; the project’s “Clean Cities” component has created employment 
for 2,000 unskilled workers and provided hands-on training resulting in the creation of several formal 
SMEs. Four solid waste SMEs have negotiated services contracts with Abidjan and created 500 
permanent jobs. 
iii. Assisting economic recovery and reform 
• Budget preparation and execution have improved and there are fewer discrepancies between approved 
budgets and actual expenditures; budget execution is published quarterly and posted on the internet. 
• A modern computerized public finance management system (SIGFIP) has been extended to departments 
outside of Abidjan, including to the CNW as part of the unification process 
• Tax burden on cocoa farmers reduced and sector transparency and management improved; 
• Government measures to improve revenue have included: (i) improving tax and customs administration, 
including in the CNW zone; (ii) enhancing the revenue contribution from national oil/gas companies; 
(iii) reducing tax exemptions; and (iv) ensuring that public enterprises transfer to the treasury all social 
contributions on wages. 
• Energy audits in support of the EITI process have been prepared, Government has adopted an electricity 
sector policy in 2009, and Côte d’Ivoire has joined EITI in 2008. 
• Government completed its first full PRSP in January 2009 and reached HIPC Decision Point March 2009.

Annex 4:  Outcome of in-country consultations July 2009 – February 2010 

During the preparation of the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), the Bank held consultations 
with central and local government and non-government representatives, including development 
partners, in Abidjan (with representatives from the south region), in Daloa (with representatives 
from the western region) and Bouaké (with representatives from the northern region).  These 
consultations were held between July 2009 and February 2010 and were organized in close 
coordination with Côte d’Ivoire’s Ministry of State, Planning and Development, the Ministry of 
Economy and Finance, and the Permanent Secretariat for the PRSP.   Key highlights of those 
discussions follow: 

Central Government 

The Government has emphasized the importance of Bank support for helping the country face 
two crises — one being the country’s internal crisis and one resulting from the global recession. 
Côte d’Ivoire needs the Bank’s support to continue the progress made in restoring discipline to 
public financial management, to come out of its financial crisis and to help catalyze job creation 
and economic activity. The CPS alignment with the PRSP and the signal of medium-term 
engagement of the Bank with the preparation of a full strategy is welcomed. The Government 
concurred with the priorities of accompanying the private sector, infrastructure and basic social 
services, underscoring that the program under the new strategy will help consolidate the gains 
made under the ISN.  The Bank’s efforts will help the government face its commitments to 
implement the PRSP. 

The Government believes meaningful levels of budgetary support will continue to be important 
given the difficult fiscal situation that the government anticipates in the near term until reaching 
HIPC Completion point. Assistance in implementing the recommendations of the FSAP, support 
for growth and competiveness, to the cocoa-coffee sector, and strengthening coordination with 
government counterparts are also needed. 

The issue of youth unemployment is critical and the Bank’s support in helping government 
address this “time-bomb” is welcomed. Coordination and donor harmonization is also an area 
that needs additional support. 

PRSP Permanent Secretariat 

The key questions raised by participants related to why the Bank did not foresee more direct IDA 
support to certain sectors, notably health, during the CPS period.  In particular, the participants 
noted that the strategy favors productive sectors over social sectors.  The Bank noted that while 
this was true, the team also needed to better showcase the link between the activities proposed 
and improving human development and social outcomes (such as with improving access to clean 
water and its impact on health; likewise support for local development would include small 
health and education projects at the local level). In addition, the Bank noted that due to limited 
IDA resources and the need to be strategic, it would not have a leading presence in all sectors.  
The Bank advised that it would be important to look at where all development partners are 
intervening to have a full appreciation of how sectors would be supported overall.  For those 
sectors receiving less support from donors, the Government could also plan to provide additional 
support. 

56 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Technical and Financial Partners 
The key issues raised by donors concerned: the need to include greater focus on strengthening 
revenues and wealth creation (through the redistribution of revenues); support to land reform; the 
need to ensure meaningful donor support to the health sector, investment climate reforms and the 
justice sector, strengthening regional programs (outside of infrastructure); and increasing the 
visibility of the IFC. The AFD representative said that they would be willing to invest in the 
health sector but would not want to be the only development partner. 

Discussions with local authorities (Mayors, Presidents of General Councils, Préfets and 
Sous-Préfets) 
The uneven and stalled decentralization process is one issue all mayors agreed needs to be 
address for the situation at the local level to improve.  Due to a number of issues around the role 
of authorities at the local level, notably the mayors (local) and préfets and sous-préfets 
(deconcentrated), and the lack of the administrative and fiscal decentralization to accompany the 
devolution of authority, local authorities say they are unable to adequately perform their duties 
and respond to the expectations of the population. Key fiscal issues are the annual preparation of 
the budget which local authorities say doesn’t reflect reality, the lack of information on taxes 
collected, and late transfers of resources to the local level. As a result, local governments often 
incur debts to local service providers.  The mayors also pointed to a need to build local 
government capacity to plan and manage budgets and services. 

In the agriculture sector, they concurred with the need to create new opportunities in rural areas, 
notably for youth and to reduce migration to urban centers.  In addition, they emphasized the 
importance of processing and transforming products at the local level to add value to exports as 
proposed in the national plan for agriculture and rural development.  The mayors suggested the 
Bank also be innovative and look at investing in technology that can transform waste into energy. 

Civil society and Parliament 
In addition to many of the themes raised above, civil society representatives also pointed to the 
importance of innovation, such as investing in renewable energy or reforestation for creating 
employment. They concurred that improving infrastructure would be extremely beneficial to the 
population, and they emphasized the need for the Bank to take into account the social aspects of 
development and to ensure that social issues are integrated into the four pillars of the Bank 
strategy.  The representative welcomed a proposal to create a civil society mechanism for 
monitoring CAS implementation, piggy-backing on the PRSP mechanism. 

Civil society also highlighted the importance of working with youth and providing opportunities 
for the millions of unemployed, taking into account the important role of women in food 
production and the need to diversify agriculture, and the need of the Bank to closely monitor the 
impact of economic governance reforms on poverty. They noted the importance of ensuring that 
civil society has more visibility on government decisions and that the media also be associated to 
the CAS consultations to help inform the general public about Bank programs. The need to 
strengthen the capacity of parliament to provide checks and balances to the executive was 
highlighted. 

Private Sector: Representatives concurred with the focus of the four pillars of the strategy and 
highlighted the importance of rehabilitating infrastructure rather than creating new infrastructure 
that government would be unable to maintain. They also pointed to the need to ensure a good link 
between infrastructure and agricultural activities. To strengthen the role of the private sector in 

57 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
agriculture, the Government needed help coming up with a policy that would provide support to 
the private sector given the high costs of associated with establishing processing and 
transformation installations. Other key issues where the Bank’s support would be welcome 
include strengthening the labor market, bringing more transparency to the public procurement 
system, and ensuring that government undertakes transparent, reasonable and affordable 
contracts; improved harmonization of tax policy with WAEMU criteria (to reduce enormous tax 
burden imposed on formal businesses); improved regulations for telecoms (accounting for 12% 
of GDP) and help lead a reflection on the role of the state vis-à-vis the private sector in a time of 
global financial crises.  Government arrears to the private sector, a weak judiciary and 
racketeering were raised as critical obstacles to the functioning of formal businesses. 

In discussion with all the non-government representatives, the need to complete the electoral 
process, to hold presidential elections, and to normalize the situation in the North, notably for the 
public administration and public services, was also emphasized.

Annex 5. Côte d’Ivoire: Joint Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability Analysis 14

15

The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) shows that Côte d’Ivoire is at a high risk of debt distress. 
 Under the external DSA baseline scenario, NPV-based indicators are projected to stay above 
the relevant indicative thresholds over the next few years. Alternative scenarios illustrate the 
impact of additional HIPC, MDRI and beyond-HIPC debt relief at the completion point. Under 
these scenarios, debt burden indicators would improve significantly. The inclusion of domestic 
debt does not alter the assessment of Côte d’Ivoire’s risk of debt distress. 

1. 

This DSA is based on the Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF) for Low-Income 
Countries. The DSA presents the projected path of Côte d’Ivoire’s external and public sector 
debt burden indicators, and assesses the country’s risk of external debt distress. 
Methodologically, the DSA differs from the Debt Relief Analysis (DRA) in the decision point 
document in that it compares the evolution over the projection period of debt burden indicators 
against policy-dependent indicative thresholds. In contrast, under the DRA, the historical debt 
burden indicators are compared to uniform thresholds in order to calculate the amount of HIPC 
debt relief that Côte d’Ivoire qualifies for in the context of the HIPC Initiative.16

17

2. 
The last DSA for Côte d’Ivoire was prepared in 2007 and assessed Côte d’Ivoire as 
being in debt distress. 
 At that time, Côte d’Ivoire was accumulating arrears to a number of 
creditors and several debt burden indicators showed substantial breaches of their respective 
indicative thresholds. Compared to 2007 DSA results, the analysis below finds improved debt 
dynamics as a consequence of projected improvements in the macroeconomic policy framework, 
large arrears clearance operations, and HIPC Initiative interim debt relief.  

Baseline Assumptions 

3. 

The assumptions of the DSA are consistent with projections of the HIPC Initiative 
DRA and with the PRGF arrangement (Box 1). After several years of below-trend growth, 
real GDP growth is expected to have improved to 2.3 percent in 2008 and increase further to 3.7 
percent in 2009. Growth continues to be driven by construction, crude oil, food production, and 

14 From the Enhanced HIPC Initiative Decision Point Document, World Bank and IMF, March 6, 2010 
15 This DSA has been prepared jointly by the World Bank and Fund staffs using the Debt Sustainability 
Framework (DSF) for Low Income Countries (see “Applying the Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-
Income Countries Post Debt Relief” (SM/06/364 and IDA/SecM2006-0564, 8/11/06). Côte d’Ivoire’s quality of 
policies and institutions, as measured by the average World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment 
(CPIA) for the period 2005-2007 (2.5), places it as a “weak performer.” The corresponding indicative 
thresholds for the external debt indicators are 30 percent for the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio, 100 percent for the 
NPV of debt-to-exports ratio, 200 percent for NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio, 15 percent for the debt service-to-
exports ratio and 25 percent for the debt service-to-revenue ratio. 

16 In addition, the results of the LIC DSA differ from the HIPC DRA because of methodological differences 
related to the definition of the discount rates and the exchange rates.

telecommunications. Overall agricultural exports stagnated, as cashew nuts expanded while 
coffee and cotton declined because of structural problems. The projected pick-up in growth to 4.7 
percent over the medium term reflects full political normalization, including successful elections, 
restoration of investor confidence, return to full capacity utilization and normal levels of public 
and private investment, and structural reforms. These projections are subject to downside risks 
related to the global environment and commodity prices.  

4. 

After some acceleration, inflation is expected to return to the WEAMU target. CPI 
inflation accelerated to 6.3 percent on average in 2008, fueled by import food prices and 
domestic price adjustments. The surge in retail food prices was tempered by the reduction in 
VAT and import duties on essential food items, effective since April. With declines in food and 
oil prices, inflation is projected to moderate at year-end and is expected to be contained over the 
medium term, anchored in the WAEMU currency union and fiscal prudence.  

5. 

Macroeconomic stability will be anchored on a prudent fiscal policy and structural 
reforms. The fiscal strategy aims at continued fiscal consolidation and addressing social and 
reconstruction needs.  The 2009 budget aims at creating additional fiscal space for growth-
enhancing investment and pro-poor social expenditure. The authorities intend to rebalance the 
composition of spending by allowing higher social expenditure while reducing sovereign 
spending and non-essential investment, including on the large-scale investment projects related to 
the transfer of the capital to Yamoussoukro. The authorities also plan to enhance transparency 
and governance, achieve debt sustainability and improve overall public finance management.  

7. 
The baseline scenario reflects the full delivery of traditional debt relief as well as 
interim HIPC assistance. 18 Consistent with the DSF guidelines, the baseline does not reflect the 
delivery of HIPC, MDRI and bilateral or multilateral beyond-HIPC assistance after the 
completion point.19
 The evolution of Côte d’Ivoire’s debt indicators after the full impact of debt 
relief under the HIPC Initiative and MDRI is presented as an alternative scenario (Figure 3). 
Furthermore, given Côte d’Ivoire’s extensive level of debt to the Paris Club, an additional 
scenario presenting the impact of HIPC, MDRI and debt relief beyond HIPC by Paris Club 
creditors is also presented.  

Debt Sustainability Analysis 

External Debt Sustainability 
8. 
Under the baseline scenario, Côte d’Ivoire’s external debt indicators remain above 
their relevant indicative thresholds (Table 1a, Figure 1). The NPV of public and publicly 
guaranteed (PPG) debt declines from 74 percent of GDP in 2007 to 63 percent of GDP in 2008 
and stays above the 30 percent indicative threshold until 2013. The decline in 2008 is primarily 
on the back of robust GDP growth. The NPV of external debt-to-revenue ratio moves below the 
200 percent indicative threshold in 2013. Conversely, debt service ratios generally remain below 
their respective indicative thresholds over the whole projection period, reflecting the high degree 

18 The authorities cleared arrears to the World Bank Group in 2008 and AfDB in early 2009 and agreed on 
modalities for arrears clearances with EIB. 
19 See “Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the Joint Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability Framework for 
Low-Income Countries” (www.imf.org and IDA/SECM2007/0226, 03/05/2007).

of concessionality of Côte d’Ivoire’s debt. However, the debt service-to-revenue ratio breaches 
its indicative threshold (25 percent of GDP) in 2012-2014, reflecting the expiration of the grace 
period assumed for the restructured debt owed to the London Club and the Paris Club. 

9. 
Côte d’Ivoire’s external debt outlook is subject to considerable vulnerabilities (Table 
1b, Figure 1). Given the impact of distortions on trend caused by the civil conflict in Côte 
d’Ivoire, the sensitivity analysis is based on regional averages and standard deviations for all 
relevant indicators. The sensitivity analysis highlights Côte d’Ivoire’s vulnerability to a one-time 
30 percent nominal depreciation of the CFA in 2009, a reduction in official and private transfers 
and net FDI, and to new public external borrowing on less favorable terms.  

10. 
Alternative scenarios assume additional delivery of debt relief at the completion 
point (Figure 3).  Debt relief under the HIPC Initiative, MDRI and possible bilateral and 
multilateral beyond-HIPC assistance, would significantly improve Côte d’Ivoire’s external debt 
outlook.  Reaching the completion point, which is assumed in 2011, and the resulting irrevocable 
debt relief would reduce all external debt indicators below the relevant indicative thresholds. 

Public Sector Debt Sustainability 
11. 
If domestic public debt is included in the analysis, Côte d’Ivoire’s debt situation 
deteriorates modestly (Table 2a, Figure 2). However, public debt ratios would fall over the long 
run owing to the projected improvement in the macroeconomic outlook and high concessionality 
of new borrowing under the baseline scenario.  

12. 
Public debt dynamics are vulnerable to shocks (Table 2b, Figure 2). Public debt 
indicators are sensitive to the assumptions on GDP growth, and a one-time depreciation of the 
CFA.  

Conclusion 

13. 
In the staff’s view, Côte d’Ivoire is at high risk of debt distress. This compares to the 
“in debt distress”, which was the outcome of the 2007 DSA. The change is primarily on account 
of multilateral arrears clearance and assumptions on interim HIPC debt relief. In the current LIC 
DSA, the PV of external debt-to-GDP and the PV of debt-to-revenue ratios, although declining, 
remain above the indicative thresholds for some time. Alternative scenarios and bound tests 
emphasize the vulnerability of Côte d’Ivoire’s external debt outlook. The inclusion of domestic 
debt does not alter the assessment of Côte d’Ivoire’s risk of debt distress. 

14. 
A sustainable external debt position can be achieved based on sound 
macroeconomic policies, debt relief and a policy of concessional borrowing. Sustained 
increased growth, solid export and fiscal revenue performance and prudent debt management are 
important for achieving debt sustainability. Debt relief under the HIPC Initiative, MDRI and 
beyond-HIPC assistance significantly improves Côte d’Ivoire’s external debt outlook.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and r = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms. 
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.  
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability. 
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows. 
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels). 
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.
