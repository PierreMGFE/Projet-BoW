COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FY2010-2013 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

i.
Tajikistan has enjoyed relative political stability and strong economic growth since 
its civil war ended in 1997, but these impressive gains are at risk in the face of an ongoing
global financial and economic crisis. The return to peace at home and a favorable external 
environment drove average growth rates of 8.6 percent during 2000-2008, coupled with 
declining inflation, fiscal surpluses, and a manageable external deficit. Since then, a recession in 
Russia has brought about a substantial drop in remittances to Tajikistan which, combined with a 
fall in aluminum and cotton exports, has constrained the fiscal space available to meet the 
country’s development challenges. Tajikistan faces energy shortages for 5-6 months in a year 
and periodically faces food security problem.  

ii.
Tajikistan faces the economic crisis from a weak position. Structural reforms have 
been undertaken in areas such as agriculture, energy, transport, and private and financial sector 
development. However, there is a need to speed up these reforms. The country’s remote, 
landlocked location, together with deteriorating infrastructure, high input costs, and weak 
regulation, poses barriers to international trade, connectivity and investment. Macroeconomic 
stability is fragile and government credibility was undermined by recent National Bank of 
Tajikistan’s (NBT)’s misreporting of data to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  Though 
over a million Tajik citizens have escaped poverty in recent years and social indicators have 
improved, the significant drop in remittances, low agricultural productivity, and rudimentary 
safety nets have left those living in or near poverty with few means to cope with shocks. Access 
to services remains limited, especially in rural areas, and there is little scope for achieving the 
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). 

iii.
The government has taken steps to address both short-term challenges and the 
medium-term reform agenda. With support from the IMF, the Staff Monitored Program (SMP) 
was completed in December 2008, and implementation of the subsequent Extended Credit 
Facility (ECF) for 2009-2012 is on track. The ECF and other donor initiatives have also 
supporting execution of the government’s May 2009 anti-crisis action plan. The government has 
recognized the need to step up progress on the medium-term reform agenda in critical areas, 
especially agriculture, energy, and private and financial sector development. 

iv.
To unleash the potential of assets such as land, water, hydropower, and human 
capital, Tajikistan will need to mitigate the effects of the crisis while working to build 
capacity towards post-crisis recovery and sustained development. Addressing the near-term 
challenges posed by the crisis will require sound macroeconomic management, including ECF 
stabilization measures and efforts to protect spending on priority social services. An effective 
crisis response will also involve actions to manage economic and social risks, including 
strengthening financial sector stability, investing in human capital, and protecting the most 
vulnerable segments of the population through improved social assistance. Over the medium-
term, successful post-crisis recovery will depend on enhancing the productivity of the country’s 
physical and human assets. Key initiatives will include strengthening the business environment 
and access to finance, boosting agricultural productivity and resolving the outstanding cotton 

i 

 
 
debt, improving the reliability of electricity and water supply, expanding the country’s energy 
production and export potential, and enhancing human capital through higher-quality education 
and health services. 

v.
The World Bank Group’s (WBG’s) Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) seeks to 
address these challenges through a constructive partnership with Tajikistan’s government, 
people, and donors. The CPS is anchored in the government’s own national development 
priorities as expressed in the National Development Strategy (NDS) and PRS3.  Recognizing the 
critical importance of private sector development to Tajikistan’s future growth and poverty 
alleviation goals, the CPS has been prepared jointly by the World Bank (WB) and International 
Finance Corporation (IFC). The strategy has also benefited from the Bank Group’s participation 
in a multi-donor effort to outline a Joint Country Partnership Strategy (JCPS) for coordinated 
donor support to Tajikistan. 

vi.
Building on lessons learned, the current strategy focuses on deepening the reform 
agenda launched under the previous CPS while strengthening mechanisms to foster good 
governance and sustainable capacity development. The objectives of the CPS are two-fold: (i) 
reducing the negative impact of the crisis on poverty and vulnerability; and (ii) paving the way 
for post-crisis recovery and sustained development. To help achieve these two objectives and 
rebuild government credibility, the Bank will work to build capacity in the context of 
Tajikistan’s Country Governance and Anti Corruption (CGAC) strategy (Annex 4). 
Implementation of the CPS will be guided by four principles of engagement: (i) frontloading 
resources to facilitate a timely, effective crisis response; (ii) flexibility in programming given the 
uncertainties surrounding the global recession; (iii) selectivity of interventions to avoid 
overstretching limited capacity and resources in both the government and the Bank Group; and 
(iv) leveraging the Bank Group’s global knowledge and expertise to attract co-financing. 

vii.
The CPS will rely on a mix of instruments. The indicative IDA15 allocation for 
Tajikistan is projected to be about US$86.6 million (SDR 55.9 million), US$30 million of which 
has been used to finance the final year of the previous CPS for FY06-09. The remaining 
allocation (about US$57 million) will finance the first two years of the proposed CPS. As a result 
of this limited financial envelope, selectivity will be critical—within and across sectors, and 
according to the Bank Group’s comparative advantage. The CPS will place greater emphasis on 
budget support through a new three-year series of Programmatic Development Policy Grants 
(PDPGs). The PDPG will serve to advance structural reforms needed to enhance the country’s 
growth potential, while providing the fiscal space needed to maintain critical social spending. 
Investment activities will rely largely on additional financing to support programs with a proven 
track record and respond quickly to the crisis. New investment operations will be limited to one 
to two per year. Operational design will be informed by targeted analytical work, and technical 
assistance will be provided to assist the government in implementing identified reforms. The 
Bank and IFC will also access various trust funds to extend the reach of the International 
Development Association (IDA)-financed activities, subject to the country’s absorptive capacity 
and Bank staff resources. In addition, IFC will provide direct investments to the private sector. 
Tajikistan will also receive additional resource equivalent of SDR 15.4 million (about US$23.4 
million) in FY10 to address the impact of the global crisis from the IDA Crisis Response 
Window.  

ii 

 
 
viii.
Progress toward expected CPS outcomes will be monitored in the context of a 
realistic and measurable results framework (Annex 1). Anticipated results are closely linked 
to national strategies to demonstrate the proposed CPS program’s contribution to country 
development objectives. Where possible, results indicators have been clearly defined on the basis 
of monitoring exercises already being undertaken or planned by the Bank Group and other 
development partners. The PDPG will support regular monitoring of a subset of CPS results, and 
the remainder will be addressed through sector dialogue. Outer-year programming will be 
defined through a mid-term CPS Progress Report in order to maintain program flexibility in an 
uncertain environment. 

ix.
The CPS supports the government in responsibly developing hydropower to secure 
the country’s energy supply and gradually generate electricity export revenues. The Bank is 
supporting the preparation of comprehensive techno-economical, social and environmental 
assessments of a large hydropower programs such as Rogun. Subject to confirmation of the 
project’s 
technical soundness, economic viability and compliance with all 
relevant 
environmental and social safeguards, the Bank would consider leading the consortium to 
implement the Rogun project. The Bank will work with the Government of Tajikistan and 
regionally recognized institutions through a regional program on energy and water to strengthen 
the technical and institutional basis for cooperation in these sectors with the aim of ensuring 
mutual economic, environmental and social benefits. 

x.
The CPS program has been designed in the context of strong and growing 
partnerships among Tajikistan’s donors. CPS activities have been selected with other 
development partners’ activities in mind, focusing on sectors where the Bank Group has a long-
standing engagement, comparative advantage, and/or complementary global knowledge. These 
parameters have guided the selection of agriculture, energy, private sector development, water 
and sanitation, and social services as the Bank Group’s primary areas of concentration. The Bank 
Group will also continue to participate in joint donor efforts to implement a recently developed 
joint aid coordination strategy in line with the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and in the 
context of the ongoing JCPS for Tajikistan. Under the CPS, the Bank Group will seek to expand 
collaboration with new bilateral development partners such as China and Russia, and to 
strengthen engagement with Tajikistan’s parliament, civil society, and private sector. 

xi.
The effectiveness of the proposed CPS program and attainment of expected 
outcomes is subject to a number of risks. Implementation of the CPS could be delayed by a 
protracted recession mainly in Russia, which would continue to have a chilling effect on growth 
in Tajikistan. Progress in implementing the CPS program may also be slowed by weak 
government commitment to deeper post-crisis reforms in productive sectors or by limited 
institutional and human capacity. The deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan and 
Pakistan could result in an unprecedented influx of refugees to Tajikistan, placing additional 
strain on economic and social services during a time of crisis. The CPS is designed to mitigate 
these risks to the extent possible, both through its dual focus on mitigating the negative impact of 
the crisis and building the foundations of post-crisis recovery, and through its principles of 
engagement.

i. The following issues are proposed for Board discussion: 

(cid:120) Do the Directors endorse the approach proposed in the presented CPS as appropriate 
for supporting the country in meeting its short-term challenges while strengthening a 
medium-term governance agenda, and build capacity to achieve medium to long term 
growth? 
Is the mix of instruments and activities consistent with the objectives, flexible 
approach and feasible within the available resource envelope? 
(cid:120) Does the CPS program successfully leverage the activities of other development 
partners in light of limited IDA resources?

INTRODUCTION

1.
This Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) presents the World Bank Group’s 
(WBG’s) strategy for Tajikistan during the period FY10-13. The CPS is anchored in the 
government’s own national development priorities as expressed in the National Development 
Strategy (NDS) and Third Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS III). To increase the effectiveness of 
the Bank Group program in ensuring sustainable growth and poverty alleviation through 
fostering private sector growth, the CPS has been prepared jointly by the World Bank (WB) and 
International Finance Corporation (IFC). The strategy has also benefited from the Bank Group’s 
participation in the ongoing development of a Joint Country Partnership Strategy (JCPS) for 
coordinated donor support to Tajikistan. It was originally proposed that the CPS would be 
prepared jointly with several other donors, but after an initial draft and subsequent consultation, 
JCPS partners decided to focus first on the development of an aid coordination strategy, 
completed in October 2009. The Bank will work with these partners to align the CPS with the 
PRS III within the JCPS framework. 

2.
The focus of the proposed CPS builds on the lessons learned in implementing the 
Bank’s previous CPS for FY06-09 (Annex 2). The objectives of the CPS are two-fold: (i) 
reducing the negative impact of the crisis on poverty and vulnerability; and (ii) paving the way 
for post-crisis recovery and sustained development. These two objectives have a common 
purpose in meeting short-term challenges and supporting a governance agenda to help build 
credibility and capacity for achieving medium to long term economic growth. Efforts to improve 
core governance will be mainstreamed across the CPS program in the context of Tajikistan’s 
Country Governance and Anti Corruption (CGAC) strategy (Annex 4). Progress toward expected 
CPS outcomes will be monitored through a realistic, measurable results framework (Annex 1), 
and outer-year programming will be defined through a mid-stream CPS Progress Report (CPS 
PR) in order to maintain program flexibility in an uncertain environment. 

II.

COUNTRY CONTEXT 

A. Geography, Population and Politics 

3.
Tajikistan is small, land-locked, and 93 percent mountainous, making it one of the 
least accessible countries in the world. It is situated 2,000 km away from the nearest port, and 
high mountains separate it from the Kyrgyz Republic in the northeast, China in the east, and 
Uzbekistan in the west and north. Its 1,400 km-long southern border is shared with Afghanistan, 
and the country is separated from Pakistan in the south by the narrow Wakhan corridor. 
Tajikistan’s remoteness, existence of regional physical barriers together with deteriorating 
Soviet-style transport infrastructure networks and weak governance and regulatory policy 
frameworks, poses significant barriers to international trade, connectivity and investment.

4.
Tajikistan is vulnerable to natural disasters, external economic conditions and is the 
poorest country in the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region. It is regularly affected by 
natural disasters such as floods, mudflows, landslides, avalanches, earthquakes, droughts and 
epidemics due to its geography, topography and climate. Heavy rains in the Spring 2009 claimed 
1 

 
 
 
human lives, destroyed villages and arable land. The country is also dependent on key 
commodity exports; aluminum, cotton, and labor (measured through remittances) accounted for 
51.8 percent of GDP in 2008.1 Severe limitations in employment opportunities in Tajikistan have 
led a large number of workers (up to 40 percent of the working population) to seek better job 
prospects overseas—largely in Russia. The resulting dependence on remittances increases 
vulnerability in the economy and among the Tajik population. Tajikistan’s gross national income 
(GNI) per capita (Atlas method) was estimated at US$560 in 2008. Its population of 7.3 million 
is young and growing rapidly, at 2 percent per year during 2000-07. A 2009 Poverty Assessment 
Update indicated that households with three or more children account for 53 percent of the total 
population, and 62 percent of the poor population.  

5.
The country has been relatively stable since 1997, but decision-making remains 
centralized and political accountability is limited. The presidency is the dominant political 
institution at the national level. President Rahmon, who was elected to a second seven-year term 
in 2006, is acknowledged for restoring stability after the civil conflict and presiding over a period 
of strong economic growth. The President’s party (People Democratic Party) won 72 percent of 
the votes in the most recent Parliamentary elections held in February 2010. Political control 
remains concentrated in the center, and the parties other than the ruling party have a limited role 
in the parliament. The past decade of political stability has provided some breathing space for the 
government to begin making the difficult transition from a command and control system to a 
modern government based on democratic principles.  

6.
Tajikistan faces diverse and complex geo-political forces. The country is seen by 
China, Russia, the European Union (EU) and the United States (US) as an important gatekeeper 
for peace and stability in Central Asia. China’s interests in the region are based on strengthening 
commercial advantages and maintaining security in border areas. Russia has a long-standing 
history of involvement in Central Asia and considers maintaining its presence in the area to be 
strategically important. The EU and the US are interested in preventing the spread of religious 
extremism, stifling drug trafficking, and countering geo-political threats in the region. 
Accordingly, the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan is of increasing 
concern to Tajikistan and its allies.

Soon after the civil war, 
peace and political stability were 
restored, and the economy began 
to register robust growth. The 
economy grew at an average of 8.6 
percent per year during 2000-2008. 
This growth was driven mainly by 
restoration of fiscal discipline and 
macroeconomic 
stability which 
stimulated 
a 
recovery 
of 
consumption, 
production 
and 
investment 
facilitated 
by 
implementation of some structural 
reforms to liberalize the economy 
following the end of conflict, and a 
favorable 
external 
environment. 
World prices for cotton and aluminum—Tajikistan’s main export commodities—soared. Rapid 
growth in Russia and other trading partners boosted demand for Tajik labor. The resulting 
growth in remittances fuelled a consumption boom in Tajikistan, which helped to support 
buoyant growth in real GDP during the 2000s. Inflation steadily declined reaching a single digit 
during 2004-05. The country has also received considerable multilateral financing over these 
years to finance its basic needs (Figure 1).

Tajikistan has taken steps to improve business environment and delivery of basic 
services. The new laws on business inspections and licensing have been adopted and under 
implementation. The Government has made good progress with the reform of the aviation sector 
by liberalizing air access, thus enhancing competition and increasing passenger turnover during 
the past few years. The Tajik Airlines has also been restructured, as a result, new independent 
companies have been established to transport passengers, operate airports and control air traffic. 
To improve delivery of basic services, the government has gradually increased social spending 
for health, education and social protection and implemented per capita financing in health and 
education on a pilot basis with further scale-up at the national level. The public sector pay 
system has become more transparent and the government intends to deepen the reforms in this 
area.

9.
Despite the ongoing structural reform implementation, progress has been slow and 
uneven. Macroeconomic management, especially fiscal policy was strengthened under the 
previous PRGF when fiscal deficits were reduced substantially and domestic financing of the 
budget was completely eliminated. Reforms of the sectors that represent sources of future growth 
(agriculture, energy, private and financial sector development, and transport) have been 
undertaken. Until recently, government’s continued intervention in agricultural production and 
markets restricted the freedom of farmers to grow whatever crops that were most profitable, and 
a burdensome cotton farm debt financing schemes have constrained growth in the agriculture. 
Recently the government with the help of donors has resolved the longstanding cotton debts 
issue and written off large parts of these debts. This is an important step towards greater farm 

3 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
freedom and agricultural productivity in the country. Financially nonviable and poorly regulated 
state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in the energy sector failed to secure a reliable supply of 
electricity throughout the country, especially in the winter. Quality of business enabling 
environment has witnessed some improvement due to reforms in legislation to simplify business 
regulations and entry. This has earned the country a place among the top ten reformers and 
improved its ranking in the Doing Business Report 2010. There is a need to deepen reforms to 
improve the business climate and reduce the cost of doing business and minimize risks to 
investors.   

10. Macroeconomic performance weakened in the mid 2000s due to an increase in 
external public debt, the quasi-fiscal activities of the central bank and external shocks. 
Tajikistan’s external debt position has weakened due to increased external borrowing from 
bilateral creditors (particularly China) to finance large infrastructure projects, although external 
public debt remains sustainable. The fiscal balance (including the public investment program, 
PIP) widened to 5.5 percent of GDP in 2008. The quasi-fiscal deficit in the energy sector, though 
declining, remained high at 10 percent of GDP in 2008. The quasi-fiscal activities of the central 
bank revealed that the country’s central bank, the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT), had 
pledged foreign exchange reserves as guarantees for foreign credits to a non-bank financial 
institution for cotton financing without reporting these activities to the International Monetary 
Fund (IMF) as required under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) for 2002-
2006. These developments coincided with supply side shocks that hit the country during the 
period 2007-2008 through a steep rise in global fuel and food prices, and eroded the 
macroeconomic indicators. The NBT’s international reserves fell below the equivalent of two 
weeks of imports; the money supply nearly doubled, fueled by expansionary monetary policy 
and annual average inflation accelerated to 20 percent in 2008. Trade and current account 
deficits and public debt rose sharply.  

11.
To restore macroeconomic stability and the credibility of the NBT and the 
government, the authorities agreed with the IMF on an economic stabilization program in 
April 2008. The Staff Monitored Program (SMP) aimed to rebuild foreign reserves and 
strengthen governance of the NBT.2 The government has succeeded in achieving all targets 
under the IMF SMP. Macroeconomic performance improved in the second half of 2008. The 
economy grew by a respectable 8 percent despite reduced agricultural (cotton) and industrial 
output resulting from drought, electricity shortages and decline in the world demand and prices 
for key export commodities, such as aluminum and cotton.  Although the spike in global food 
and fuel prices in early 2008 exacerbated inflation (which reached 26 percent in June 2008), it 
subsequently receded to 12 percent by end-December 2008 reflecting relatively effective 
monetary policy and decline in the global commodity prices. The current account deficit declined 
to 7.7 percent of GDP as a result of strong remittances inflows (47 percent of GDP), enabling the 
NBT to accumulate international reserves equivalent to 1.1 months of imports (end-2008). The 
overall fiscal balance (excluding externally-financed investment) remained in surplus (at 1.4 

2 The Staff Monitored Program (SMP) measures included the implementation of a special audit of the National Bank 
of Tajikistan (NBT), strengthening the autonomy and governance of the NBT through the passage of appropriate 
amendments to the central bank law, and strengthening governance and monitoring of the largest state-owned 
enterprises (SOEs), including through tenders for external audits of the two largest SOEs (Barki Tajik and Talco) by 
reputable international firms.

percent of GDP) owing to strict expenditure control combined with buoyant revenues 
(amounting to 22.1 percent of GDP) reflecting the high nominal GDP and strong import growth. 
The overall fiscal deficit (including externally-financed investment) slightly declined to 5.5 
percent of GDP (down from 6.1 percent 2007) reflecting disbursements of concessional external 
financing for public investment projects. The stock of public debt declined to 28.9 percent of 
GDP due to prudent debt policy and strict control on non-concessional borrowing (Table 1). 

12.
The government adopted an anti-crisis action plan and agreed with the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the new Extended Credit Facility (ECF) to reduce 
the impact of the crisis. The anti-crisis action plan aims to protect critical social spending (e.g., 
education, health, social protection), support improved efficiency and quality of public services 
through targeted increases in public sector wages, and expand employment opportunities through 
social programs such as a cash-for-work scheme and measures to facilitate entrepreneurship. The 
government also plans to continue implementing its civil service reform program with the 
objective of improving the efficiency and the quality of public service delivery. The successful 
completion of the SMP in April 2009 has paved the way for a new ECF for 2009-2012.3 The 
ECF’s macroeconomic priorities include: (i) maintaining a modest fiscal deficit, excluding the 
PIP; (ii) facilitating external adjustment through the exchange rate depreciation; (iii) 
strengthening monetary policy and banking supervision frameworks; and (iv) building up foreign 
currency reserves. The ECF’s structural reform priorities include: (i) strengthening governance 
of the NBT; (ii) improving the operational and financial management of large SOEs; and (iii) 
adopting a strategy to resolve cotton sector debt. Over the course of the program, the IMF is 
expected to lend US$116 million, of which about US$40 million was released in May 2009 after 
approval of the ECF. An additional US$40 million is expected to be disbursed in May 2010 upon 
completion of the first and second reviews. To achieve the overall fiscal deficit target, the 
authorities are deferring domestically-financed capital spending, continuing only with the highest 
priority projects.   
13.
The global economic crisis has weakened economic performance. Output growth fell 
to 3.4 percent in 2009 (although higher than the original forecast of 2 percent) mainly driven by 
buoyant non-cotton agricultural output. However, a significant reduction in remittances inflows 
(by 31 percent) caused real per-capita disposable income to contract for the first time in many 
years. Inflation receded substantially to 5 percent by end-2009. The current account deficit 
declined to 7.3 percent of GDP due to lowered trade deficit (from 53 percent in 2008 to 39 
percent of GDP in 2009). This was driven by lowered prices of imported fuel and food, reduced 
domestic demand, and by a currency depreciation that increased export competitiveness. As a 
result, the level of international reserves fell to equivalent of 1.4 months of imports in 2009. Due 
to slow economic activities and the anti-crisis fiscal measures (lowered VAT and income taxes) 
to stimulate private sector development, tax revenue fell by 1.1 percent of GDP (from 18.7 
percent in 2008 to 17.6 percent in 2009). Budget support from development partners (WB, ADB, 
and EC) amounting to US$74 million helped offsetting the impact of revenue shortfall, thus 
enabling the government to increase social expenditure under the anti-crisis action plan. The 
overall fiscal balance (excluding externally-financed investment) registered a deficit of 0.5 
percent of GDP in 2009 and the overall fiscal deficit (including externally-financed investment) 

3 The Extended Credit Facility (ECF) replaced the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility following the entry into 
force of the IMF Executive Board’s decision of July 2009.

However, the somoni depreciation is expected to add stress on the banking system.
The recently stress tests carried by IMF staff indicated that banks are vulnerable to a large 
depreciation of the somoni because debtors with U.S. dollar-denominated loans (about 60 
percent of outstanding loans) do not necessarily have foreign exchange income. To help limit the 
risk of a banking crisis in Tajikistan, the authorities are strengthening the regulatory 
requirements and intensifying supervision. The priorities are to improve the liquidity position of 
the banks and to curb the impairment of their assets. With the support of the World Bank and the 
IMF, the NBT is also drawing up contingency plans for tackling a banking crisis, so that it is not 
caught unprepared should one materialize.  

15.
Under the ECF program, a sound fiscal and monetary program has been agreed for 
2010. The economy is expected to grow by 4 percent in 2010 due to a slow recovery of the 
global economy. The overall fiscal deficit (excluding the Public Investment Program) is 
projected to increase from 0.5 percent of GDP in 2009 to 1 percent of GDP in 2010. However, 
this target and the associated ECF performance criteria for domestic borrowing will be 
challenging due to a slowly increase in domestic revenue arising from lowered tax rates 
associated with anti-crisis fiscal measures, a weaker demand for imports and domestic 

6 

 
 
 
 
production. With non-discretionary expenditure on wages and salaries, interest payments, and 
transfers and subsidies already accounting for 65.8 percent of total budget expenditure in 2010, 
further spending cuts will have to come from operations and maintenance activities, if additional 
donor support is not available. The authorities have opted to defer some domestically financed 
capital spending, but given the ECF target for an overall fiscal deficit, there remains a fiscal gap 
between available resources and essential spending needs that is expected to be financed through 
budget support grants from donors.

C. Medium-term Outlook and Debt Sustainability

16.
Tajikistan’s economic prospects are expected to improve over the medium-term, 
although much depends on the positive confluence of external and domestic factors. The 
protracted recession that is currently affecting Russia is expected to begin unwinding by the end 
of 2010, allowing gradual recovery in Tajikistan. A recovery in demand and trade would support 
Tajikistan’s exports and employment opportunities (migrant and domestic). At home, successful 
implementation of the government’s anti-crisis action plan and the ECF—as well as good 
progress on structural reforms to reduce supply constraints—is expected to contribute to an 
economic rebound. Increased availability of employment opportunities through facilitating and 
attracting investment would also help address poverty and food security concerns. Economic 
recovery would depend in part on the timing, extent and focus of donor support. 

17.
Output is expected to recover slowly over the medium-term. The IMF is projecting an 
upturn in domestic output of 4 percent in 2010 and 5 percent on average during 2011-2013, 
though substantial downside risks persist. This is supported by the implementation of structural 
reforms aimed at removing the most pressing barriers to expansion of productive capacity in 
agriculture, energy and the private sector as well as increased remittances and investment due to 
rebounding regional growth. Prudent management of monetary and fiscal policy is expected to 
keep inflation to single digits and domestic and external balances at sustainable levels. Given a 
high population growth rate, a small positive growth will not be sufficient to reduce poverty. 
Growth will need to accelerate to pre-crisis rates to ensure that gains in poverty reduction are not 
be eroded. Debt sustainability is likely be further challenged by the absorption of cotton sector 
debt and the associated need to recapitalize the NBT. 

18.
Tajikistan can grow and recover over the medium-term only if it addresses the key 
binding constraint to growth and utilizes its hydropower potential. A Country Economic 
Memorandum (CEM) prepared in 2009 found that growth is constrained by a low level of private 
investment. Medium to long term growth can be achieved through hydropower production, 
agriculture, small and medium businesses, infrastructure, and labor migration. Raising private 
investment requires that the government: (a) improve the investment climate and protect property 
rights in order to attract investment from abroad and thereby meet the large capital expenditure 
requirements of large investment projects, (b) shift resource away from cotton to food crops and 
fodder crops for livestock through the removal of restrictions on the “freedom to farm”, the 
liberalization of land use and agricultural input and output markets, and carefully planned 
support services for farmers and livestock producers, and (c) alleviate key bottlenecks such as 
unreliable power supply through institutional and governance reforms to improve generation and 
distribution systems in the energy sector and increasing tariffs to cost recovery levels. These 

7 

 
 
actions would be facilitated by efforts to strengthen governance, transparency, and accountability 
in Tajikistan.  

19.
Debt sustainability remains at risk. In recent years, the government has borrowed 
increasingly from bilateral creditors, mainly to finance infrastructure projects that aim to support 
economic growth over the medium-term. Most of the debt stock growth in 2008 resulted from 
the disbursement of loans from China (over 5 percent of GDP) to finance roads and energy 
projects (power transmission lines). Though the ratio of private and public sector external debt to 
GDP improved from 53.6 percent in 2005 to 47.3 percent in 2008,4 the joint IMF-WB debt 
sustainability analysis (DSA) conducted in February 2009 shows that Tajikistan’s risk of debt 
distress remains high; this is also confirmed by a recent DAS update.5 The deterioration of 
macroeconomic indicators such as growth and export demand is likely to cause the net present 
value of debt-to-GDP and debt service-to-exports indicators to breach policy thresholds. 
Alternative scenarios and stress tests indicate that debt sustainability is vulnerable to adverse 
macroeconomic shocks such as lower GDP, declining export growth, real exchange rate 
depreciation, non-concessional borrowing and even an additional debt on concessional terms. 
This underscores the need for the government to exercise extreme caution in incurring new debt, 
to carefully vet large-scale investment projects, and to ensure efficient utilization of external 
resources. Sound macroeconomic policies and acceleration of structural reforms would also be 
essential to maintain debt sustainability by enhancing growth potential and safeguarding external 
stability. 

D. Poverty and Social Developments 

20.
Strong growth driven by 
remittances 
contributed 
to 
impressive progress on poverty 
reduction in Tajikistan. According 
to 
the 2007 Tajikistan Living 
Standards Survey (TLSS), and using 
the poverty line of US$2.15 per day 
in Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), 
the poverty headcount declined from 
64 percent in 2003 to 41 percent6 in 
2007. In absolute terms, about 1.35

4 Including noticeable improvement in the PPG debt to GDP ratio from 38.8 percent in 2005 to 28.9 percent in 2008. 
5 The recent IMF update of the DSA (April 2010), shows that debt ratios for external debt look significantly better 
when remittances included into the denominators of the modified debt burden ratios. The vulnerability indicators are 
substantially lower than previously assessed and remain below their respective thresholds. However, this does not 
change Tajikistan’s high risk rating, which is based on indicators without accounting for remittances inflows. Debt-
to-export ratio significantly exceeds the threshold throughout the projected period, and debt-to-GDP ratio breaches 
the threshold during 2014-2019, albeit marginally. 
6 This is the expected reduction in poverty between 2003 and 2007 as estimated by the WB using the 2003-2007 
economic growth rate (in per capita terms) applied to the 2003 household survey data. Alternatively, based on the 
absolute poverty line derived from the 2007 TLSS, the poverty headcount declined from 72 percent in 2003 to 54 
percent in 2007.

live in rural areas) escaped poverty in recent years, though about 2.9 million remain poor (Table 
2). The incidence of extreme poverty7 declined from 42.1 percent in 2003 to 17.3 percent in 
2007, dropping more rapidly in rural areas. The strong growth in remittances between 2003 and 
2007 accounts for about half of the observed reduction in poverty.8 Poverty is mainly a rural 
phenomenon in Tajikistan, with the rural poor accounting for 75 percent of all poor and 72 
percent of the extreme poor (Box 1). 

Box 1:  Poverty in Tajikistan 

Poverty in Tajikistan is largely a story of the working poor in the rural sector. Though employment—especially 
in non-agriculture sectors—does reduce the risk of poverty, 58 percent of poor people in Tajikistan live in households 
where the household head is employed. Rural areas account for nearly 80 percent of the working poor, as 
employment is concentrated in agriculture and related activities. Other characteristics of poor households include 
three or more children, household heads with limited education, landlessness or ownership of small plots in rural 
areas, and location at high altitudes. 
Many households in Tajikistan send workers abroad as a poverty-coping strategy. About 25 percent of 
households participating in the 2007 TLSS included a migrant worker who was abroad or had returned in the past 
year. Employment abroad does reduce the risk of poverty, as the total and extreme poverty headcounts (using a cost-
of-basic-needs approach) among households with over 20 percent migrant workers were 43 percent and 13 percent, 
respectively, as compared to 54 percent and 17 percent among households with fewer migrant workers.  
Yet Tajikistan’s dependence on remittances is a source of considerable vulnerability. Scenario analysis based on 
TLSS data suggests that a 30 percent decline in remittances would increase the national poverty rate by 6 percentage 
points and inequality by 3 percentage points. This effect would be expected to be stronger in rural areas due to the 
higher concentration of migrant workers in those areas.  
Non-income dimensions of poverty show limited progress. Pressure on public service delivery grew significantly 
after independence due to rapid population growth and reduced public spending. As a result, infrastructure is of poor 
quality; access to electricity, heating, and safe drinking water is limited; and unofficial payments for services are high 
and prevalent. The social protection system is rudimentary, dominated by old-age and disability pensions with 
virtually no social assistance. Together, these factors have constrained access to education and health services, 
especially for the poorest of the poor in rural areas.  
Food security remains a concern. Food insecurity is high among the extreme poor and worsens between late winter 
and early spring. Common coping strategies include reducing the number of meals to two or fewer per day and 
altering the nature of food consumed. As a result, the poorest quintile of the population consumes fewer than 2,000 
calories per person per day on average.

21.
The decline in some social indicators has improved. Social indicators such as school 
enrollment, infant mortality, and child mortality were poor at the end of the 1990s, as a 
consequence of the post-independence civil conflict, weak governance and deterioration of 
public services. As peace and stability took hold, the environment became conducive to the 
implementation of structural reforms, increased public expenditure, and strengthened social 
sector management. In time, indicators began to reflect these improvements. School enrollment 

7 Extreme poverty refers to food poverty. It reflects the cost of a typical food basket needed to consume 2,250 
calories per person per day with typical needs. The value of this extreme poverty line is equivalent to 89 somoni per 
month at end-2007 prices.

rates increased at all levels of education between 2000 and 2006.9 The primary completion rate 
rose from 95 percent in 2000 to 99 percent in 2005. Improved maternal health services, 
combined with a reduction in poverty, contributed to a significant decline in infant mortality 
(from 75 per 1,000 live births in 2000 to 56 in 2007). Similarly, child mortality declined from 93 
to 68 per 1,000 live births. Gender equality improved, with the ratio of girls to boys enrolled in 
primary school rising from 93 in 2000 to 95 in 2007. 

22.
Despite this important progress, it is unlikely that Tajikistan will achieve its 
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. The indicators related to infant mortality 
(per 1,000 live births), under-five mortality (per 1,000 live births), and maternal mortality (per 
100,000 live births) stand at 56, 68, and 97, compared to the 2015 MDG targets of 25, 30, and 
30, respectively. The incidence of tuberculosis (TB) and HIV/AIDS has been increasing, and the 
use of contraception and knowledge of HIV/AIDS prevention remains limited. The percentage of 
the rural population with access to safe water stood at 55 percent in 2007, compared to a target of 
74 percent by 2015. The reasons for this have much to do with the limited financial, institutional, 
and human resources available to the country to adequately address its basic social challenges. 
Social sector expenditure remains lower than those prevailing in other Commonwealth of 
Independent States (CIS) countries due to budget constraints. Despite efforts to improve its 
social sector, the quality of education and health services remains below Soviet-era levels. A 
large proportion of the population still has only limited access to basic services. The social safety 
net system that was established to protect the vulnerable, including the unemployed, is 
rudimentary. 

E. Governance

23.
Development in Tajikistan depends on improvements in the governance. The civil 
war took a heavy toll on Tajikistan’s institutional and human capacity. Efforts to rebuild that 
capacity are impeded by specifics of the country’s political economy and limited financial 
resources to upgrade institutions and retrain workers with outdated technical skills to properly 
manage the transition to a market economy. Capacity limitations constrain the government’s 
effectiveness in designing and implementing programs to achieve priority development 
objectives. In addition, the political arrangements between the national and sub-national 
government that are required to keep peace appear to limit the scope of governance reforms. 

24.
The government’s effectiveness needs to be increased at both national and sector 
levels. During the last CPS period, political interference, weak capacity, and lack of transparent 
institutional arrangements in Tajikistan contributed to critical domestic policy slippages. Uneven 
progress has been achieved in: (a) resolving long-standing rural reforms,10 (b) effectively 
managing macroeconomic policy, (c) addressing successive energy and food price crises, and (d) 
inspiring confidence in dealing with the impact of the global economic crisis on the Tajik 
economy. The disruption in energy supplies during the severe winter of 2008 further highlighted 

9 According to the TLSS, gross pre-primary enrollment increased from 73 to 91 percent, net primary enrollment 
from 96 to 97 percent, net secondary enrollment from 71 to 80 percent, and gross tertiary enrollment from 14 to 18 
percent. 
10 These rural reforms include land restructuring, resolution of the cotton farm debt, freedom-to-farm initiatives, and 
reduction of state interventions in cotton production and marketing. 

10 

 
 
 
                                                 
the government’s inability to overcome low capacity and weak corporate governance among 
state-owned energy enterprises (especially Barki Tajik and Tajiktransgaz). Increasingly viewed 
as having limited capacity to manage crises, the government’s effectiveness in managing 
conventional economic duties is also in question as a result of the misuse of public funds 
(discovered to have been kept completely off-budget) and the belated admission of misreporting 
to the IMF in 2007. 

25. Work is underway to strengthen public financial management (PFM) and public 
sector performance in Tajikistan. PFM reforms initiated over the last decade have begun to 
bear fruit, including the introduction of a partially automated Treasury system, development of a 
new budget classification system, efforts to strengthen planning and resource allocation in the 
social sectors, and promulgation of a new procurement law. To strengthen public sector 
performance more broadly, the government streamlined the structure of central public 
administration to eliminate excessive fragmentation of institutions, clarify mandates, and 
strengthen institutional capacity. Civil service reforms have been initiated, including efforts to 
introduce competitive recruitment and pay linked to job descriptions. A functional review of the 
administration and delivery of social services has led to the amendment of key legislation and 
institutional improvements in priority sectors (e.g., streamlining education service delivery and 
financing, piloting patient fees in health care institutions, introducing policy-based budgeting). 
Service delivery standards have been designed and institutional changes needed to improve the 
quality of social services have been initiated. 

26.
 However, public finance management system needs to be strengthened and 
transparency and accountability improved to avoid potential risks to public funds. A 2007 
Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Assessment indicated that the budget 
process remains fragmented and there are substantial deviations between budget allocations and 
execution, both in amount and composition. Tracking and control of commitments are not well 
linked to the procurement function. In March 2007, the government adopted a strategy for 
improving internal control and established pilot internal audit units in a number of line 
ministries. Yet internal audit remains weak, focusing more on individual transactions than on 
systemic issues and effectiveness of public resource use. Development of legal and institutional 
structures that will support the establishment of an independent external audit institute is 
ongoing. Accounting does not comply with international standards and is still done manually at 
all levels except the central treasury, though basic systems of accounting, recording and 
reporting are in place. There is still no reliable, modern financial management information 
system to ensure quality and reliability in reporting. In an effort to address these concerns, the 
government of Tajikistan adopted a comprehensive PFM Reform Strategy for 2009-18 in March 
2009 and the Ministry of Finance (MoF) has prepared a more targeted Action Plan for 2009-11. 

27.
 Cross-country indicators show that tackling governance problems in Tajikistan 
must become a priority. Tajikistan has recently improved on the ease of doing business (DB), 
according to the joint World Bank Group Doing Business 2010 survey (paragraph 40) and was 
among the top 10 world reformers. However, the country’s ranking remains low at 152nd out of 
183 countries, as compared to the LIC average of 141. The quality of public administration, as 
measured in the 2008 Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), is stable at 2.5 (out 
of 6) as compared to the average among IDA borrowers of 2.9. At the same time, the 2008 
World Governance Indicators rank Tajikistan in the bottom 15 percent of countries on voice and 

11

TAJIKISTAN’S DEVELOPMENT AGENDA AND PRIORITIES  

A. National Development Agenda 

28.
In 2005, Tajikistan adopted the NDS for 2006-2015. The NDS aims to support the 
creation of a democratic and prosperous state where the benefits of political and economic 
development are available to the population as a whole. Key priorities include improving public 
administration, developing the private sector and attracting investment, and developing human 
potential.   

29.
A follow-up PRS III for 2010-2012 presented a medium-term program to implement 
the NDS vision, building on the lessons learned under PRS II. It builds on the overarching 
objective and strategic building blocks of the PRS II. The PRS III’s overarching objective is to 
promote sustainable improvements in living standards, particularly of vulnerable groups. It 
maintains the three strategic programming blocks spelled out in the PRS II: (i) a functional block 
on public administration reform, macroeconomics, investment climate, private sector, regional 
cooperation and global economic integration; (ii) a production block on food security, 
agriculture, infrastructure, energy and industry; and (iii) a social block on health, education, 
water and sanitation, housing, and social welfare. It recognizes several crosscutting issues, 
including institutional reforms, demographic change, environmental management, and gender 
equality.  

12 

 
 
 
 
30.
The PRS III updates key reforms to support economic growth and poverty 
reduction. Measures to improve governance in public administration and SOEs include reducing 
corruption at all levels of government, strengthening public procurement and financial 
management systems, and reducing involvement of the state in economic activities in order to 
promote private sector development. Strengthening Tajikistan’s investment climate is seen as the 
key to stimulating growth, and the PRS III aims to achieve this goal by simplifying complex and 
non-transparent business regulations, strengthening property rights, and improving infrastructure 
services. Under the PRS III, the government plans to increase public spending on education and 
health in order to promote attainment of the MDGs. Financing reforms aim to improve the 
efficiency and equity of public spending, while structural reforms (targeting institutions, human 
resource management, and infrastructure) are expected to improve the quality of and access to 
public services over the medium- to long-term. 

31.
The PRS III reflects lessons learned from implementation of the PRS II. It presents a 
comprehensive description of how poverty analysis and monitoring will be strengthened over 
time. It responds to the need for post-crisis recovery and growth and outlines the measures being 
taken to accelerate structural reforms, including securing property rights and enhancing the 
business environment. It also discusses actions to improve public sector governance and public 
sector management, especially through reform of the public administration and pay system. The 
PRS II presents a clear process for costing, prioritizing and sequencing interventions, and aims to 
enhance the coordination of development partner support. Therefore, it is better prioritized by 
focusing on the energy sector and sustainable agricultural development.  

32.
The Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) suggests areas of improvement and notes that 
PRS III program remains ambitious in light of unidentified financing sources. The JSAN 
suggests that the PRS III specify the priority programs that promote rural livelihoods and 
improve access of the poor to social services, thus reducing poverty. To ensure sustained 
economic growth over the medium-term, the PRS III should deepen structural reforms to 
improve the business climate and strengthen property rights. The JSAN notes that the energy 
sector strategy should provide an integrated framework that links energy development challenges 
with other critical poverty and growth challenges. It suggests that the government continued 
focus on human capital development to build on the gains of the past decade, improve 
mechanisms to protect vulnerable groups, and strengthen governance to ensure that resources are 
used to achieve lasting development results. Finally, the staffs recommend that the authorities 
either need to identify additional financing sources for their ambitious program or reprioritize 
further across different objectives.  

33.
The PRS III provides an adequate framework for CPS support. The ongoing global 
financial crisis has prompted the government to better prioritize the agenda in the context of an 
anti-crisis action plan. The plan aims to reinforce macroeconomic stability, maintain delivery of 
essential public services, and address vulnerabilities faced by the population. This action plan, 
combined with the unfinished PRS II agenda, form the basis for the PRS III. The CPS aligns its 
strategic objectives with those of the PRS III and will support the implementation of this action 
plan, monitoring the process and adjusting support as needed. IDA will focus on areas where it 
has a comparative advantage, complements activities carried out by other development partners, 
or involvement is requested by the government.

B. Key Economic and Social Priorities

34.
Tajikistan faces the economic crisis from a weak position, but amid the significant 
challenges ahead lie important opportunities to advance the development agenda during 
the next CPS period. In order to unleash the potential of key assets such as land, water, and 
human capital, Tajikistan needs to deepen structural reforms and spur much needed private 
investment. As discussed above, however, the fiscal space available for such reforms is limited 
in the wake of falling remittances and revenues, and an increasing public debt burden. 
Macroeconomic management capacity is limited, and government credibility has suffered in the 
wake of governance missteps such as the NBT’s misreporting of data to the IMF. In this context, 
the government will need to refocus its efforts on addressing critical near-term challenges: 
mitigating the negative impact of the crisis on poverty and vulnerability, and reducing the 
medium-term constraints to reaping the full benefits of a sustainable post-crisis recovery.  

i. Reducing the negative impact of the crisis on poverty and vulnerability  

35.
Building on its anti-crisis action plan, the government formulated a program for 
immediate economic stabilization and rationalization of public expenditure in April 2009.11 
Maintaining prudent monetary and fiscal policies will be essential for macroeconomic stability, 
and these efforts will be guided by the macroeconomic framework agreed with the IMF under 
the ECF arrangement. Monetary policy will aim to maintain a competitive exchange rate and 
stabilize inflation to offer greater incentives for private investment. In particular, the authorities 
have committed to a flexible exchange rate while aiming to rebuild international reserves. On the 
fiscal side, while still committed to the deficit target of 0.5 percent of GDP, the government 
revised its budget in May 2009 to reflect downgraded revenue estimates. The revised budget 
followed three main principles: (i) ring-fencing social expenditure to maintain delivery of key 
public services such as education and health; (ii) prioritizing social assistance to vulnerable 
groups; and (iii) scaling back non-essential expenditure items including operation and 
maintenance spending. The capital spending on the rehabilitation of the construction site of a 
large hydropower plant at Rogun has been kept at the original budget level (US$120 million) as 
it is considered a strategic development priority to achieve energy independence and provide a 
basis for growth and develop regional trade through hydroenergy exports within Central Asia 
and with South Asia.12 Given that revenue collections and funding for budget support were better 
than expected, the macro-fiscal targets agreed with the IMF were met nearly fully with a small 
deficit in 2009.  

36.
To ensure continued delivery of basic public services necessary for the poor during 
the crisis, the government is committed to protect social spending. As agreed with the IMF, 
the ECF program includes an indicative target on the level of social spending. Towards this end, 
budgetary allocation for the education and health sectors were kept at the same level as that of 
2008. This ensured that provisioning of public services by schools and health facilities are

Resolution #232 April. 
12 The hydropower plant at Rogun was started during Soviet times in the 1980s, but construction stalled in the early 
1990s due to the breakup of the Soviet Union and the Tajik civil war. In 1993, the half-finished works were severely 
damaged by a major flood, causing serious loss of built assets. Since 2008, the government has been financing 
construction activities to restore the site to its pre-1993 status. 

14 

 
 
                                                 
sustained during the crisis. Education and health personnel can continue serving the population 
as sufficient budgetary funds will be allocated for wages and salaries as well as some relevant 
recurrent expenditure. The government also agreed to track these expenditures and monitor their 
performance through the introduction of a Virtual Poverty Fund (VPF) with assistance from 
donors.  However, actual spending on the social sectors increased in 2009 (43.6 percent of the 
total state budget excluding PIP and extra-budgetary fund, as compared to approved spending of 
42 percent). The 2010 budget envisages an increase in social expenditures due in part to 
increased public sector wage for education and health personnel. 

37.
The government plans to strengthen the social protection system to reduce the 
vulnerability of the poor to future domestic and external shocks. Though poor people are 
especially at risk during social downturns, the social protection measures currently in place in 
Tajikistan are not adequate for effective crisis response as they are inefficiently designed, 
targeted, and administered. Implementation is fragmented and institutional capacity is limited. 
The anti-crisis program provides a small fiscal stimulus to generate employment, including 
priority measures such as unemployment benefits, skills training, micro-credit, and public works 
programs. Those unable to find employment following training can receive employment benefits 
for up to six months provided they have a recent employment history. Public works programs 
include mainly mini-hydropower and small road maintenance projects. The government is also 
working with donors to scale up food programs and to provide high quality wheat seeds and 
fertilizer to farmers in order to mitigate food insecurity. Quarterly surveys indicate that the 
economic crisis, coupled with recent increases in food prices, has had a visible impact on rural 
households in Tajikistan.13 More unemployment, fewer remittances, and even bankruptcies of 
small businesses have reduced access to food. Finally, the government is working with the 
European Commission (EC) and IDA to develop a social protection strategy encompassing: (i) a 
labor market and migrant strategy; (ii) targeting of social benefits and privileges; (iii) expansion 
and physical upgrading of care institutions; and (iv) capacity building in relevant public 
institutions. 

38.
The anti-crisis action plan aims to maintain the stability of the financial system by 
reducing its vulnerability to further deterioration of economic fundamentals. While 
Tajikistan's financial sector, primarily commercial banks, has not been affected directly by the 
global financial crisis, it has become more vulnerable on account of indirect linkages (for 
example, through trade credits). First, there has been an increase in the number of non-
performing loans to cotton farmers,14 impairing banks’ asset quality and lowering their capital 
and liquidity. Widespread loan defaults could turn into a banking crisis given low capital levels 
at the NBT, which limits its ability to implement effective monetary policy. Second, the rate of 
growth of foreign and local currency deposits have declined due to the slowdown in remittances 
and lower deposits from large corporate clients such as the Tajik Aluminum Company 

13 World Food Program and Department for International Development, Food Security Bulletin, May 2009 and 
September 2009.  
14 In 2008, the government extended TJS 140 million (US$41 million) to selected commercial banks to on-lend to 
cotton farmers at capped interest rates (the credit represented 17 percent of total outstanding loans in 2008), with the 
banks bearing the credit risk. In 2009, the government allocated another TJS 180 million (US$40 million) to the 
cotton sector. However, the cotton sector historically has a poor repayment record due to poor governance, which is 
now being exacerbated by lowered world demand and falling cotton prices.

(TALCO). A number of banks have experienced liquidity problems and have used the NBT’s 
liquidity facility (with a lending volume of about Tajik somoni (TJS) 2 million (US$0.4 million) 
for up to three months). Finally, a high degree of dollarization15 has increased the banking 
system’s vulnerability to somoni depreciation, as many businesses that have borrowed in dollars 
have local currency revenues. To address these issues, the NBT has intensified banking 
supervision and developed contingency plans to deal with a potential collapse in confidence. 

39.
The NBT’s internal transparency, accountability, and banking supervision capacity 
will be improved to maintain the public’s confidence in the banking system. In December 
2008, the NBT ceased its financing of the cotton sector and abolished cotton export licenses. In 
June 2009, the NBT approved an action plan in response to the findings of the special audit 
carried out under the SMP, and posted it on its webpage. During May-August 2009, with 
technical assistance (TA) from the WB, amendments to the Law on the National Bank of 
Tajikistan and a new Law on Banking Activities were passed by Parliament and signed into law 
by the President. The amended laws prohibit the NBT from engaging in direct lending, 
strengthen the independence of the Board of Directors, and will lead to stronger and more 
predictable supervision of banks. The NBT will require banks to apply modern governance and 
transparency principles, including the obligation to disclose beneficial shareholders. The role of 
the NBT’s internal audit function is also being strengthened. 

ii. Reducing constraints to a post-crisis recovery and sustained economic growth 

40.
To achieve a post-crisis recovery and sustained growth, Tajikistan needs to expand 
the productive capacity of physical assets including land, water, and human capital. Strong 
growth during the past decade has pushed Tajikistan close to its production possibility frontier. 
Without expanding this boundary, a post-crisis economic recovery may not be sustained over the 
medium-term. The solution is to reduce constraints to growth, an undertaking that will require 
Tajikistan to renew its commitment to deepening structural reforms that have been initiated. 
Private investment will follow once improvements have taken hold in the business environment 
at both the macroeconomic and business levels. The productive capacity of arable land, water, 
and labor—the main sources of growth in Tajikistan—must be significantly enhanced to increase 
the benefit from the country’s comparative advantages. Fortunately, the country’s water 
resources can be harnessed to provide hydropower for domestic use and for export to rapidly 
growing neighboring economies (such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Kyrgyz Republic and 
Uzbekistan). Human capital must not only be preserved but also enhanced in order to supply the 
private sector with healthy and skilled workers.  

41.
A sound business environment will stimulate the private investment necessary to 
sustain growth over the medium term. The government has recently taken steps to improve 
business and investment climate, as reflected in its place among the world’s top ten reforming 
countries in Doing Business 2010.16 In July 2008, a presidential decree placed a two-year 

15 At end-2008, deposits and loans denominated in dollars accounted for 67 and 56 percent of total deposits and 
loans of Tajik commercial banks. 
16 Tajikistan ranked 152 out of 183 countries in the Doing Business 2010, up from 159 out of 181 countries in the 
2009 survey. Areas of concern include starting a business (143rd dealing with construction permits (177th), getting 
credit (176th), paying taxes (162nd), and trading across borders (179th). See: Doing Business 2010: Reforming 
through Difficult Times.

moratorium on inspections regulating SMEs, with some exceptions. In July 2009 the government 
launched the “200 days of reform” program, with the aim of improving the business environment 
and making the country more attractive to investors. With support from the EC, the government 
has introduced One-Stop Shop in 50 out of 68 tax inspectorates to simplify business registration 
process. The inadequate protection of property rights and inconsistent application of laws and 
regulations discourage private investment in Tajikistan. It should be noted that some external 
factors beyond the government’s control also hinder trade and growth in Tajikistan including 
difficulties in importing electricity and transit of goods through neighboring countries. Costs are 
high due to the unreliable supply of electricity, fragmented and poorly maintained infrastructure, 
time-consuming customs procedures, and labor skill shortages in some sectors. The cost of doing 
business is further increased by corruption and bribery. As a result of the poor investment 
climate combined with a low level of migrants’ income, remittances—a major source of 
incoming finance in Tajikistan—are generally spent on consumption or real estate rather than on 
private sector investment.  

42.
Private sector growth and investment would also benefit from increased access to 
finance at a lower cost. Tajikistan’s financial system is underdeveloped and has limited capacity 
to serve the investment needs of business. Weak governance, low transparency, and poor service 
quality in banks lower public confidence and limit deposits, thus raising the cost of funding. The 
legal framework is inadequate, and the capacity to implement and enforce applicable laws is 
weak. Legal and institutional arrangements for secured lending are particularly problematic, 
restricting the range of collateral that can be used to secure loans. The availability of diverse 
financial products and services catering to specific business needs is limited, especially in rural 
areas. Further, high interest rate spreads, short loan duration, widespread reliance on 
insider/related lending, and low branch density discourage the private sector from seeking 
financing from the banking sector. The insurance sector is undeveloped and operates within a 
weak regulatory and supervisory framework. To address some of these weaknesses, the 
government has begun to implement the recommendations of the Financial Sector Assessment 
Program (FSAP) with support from the Bank Group and IMF. Measures undertaken include 
adoption of new legislation and development of a financial sector strategy.  

43.
Agriculture reform will be critical to enhancing Tajikistan’s productive capacity 
and reducing poverty in rural areas. Good progress has been made in wheat production 
following the government’s use of IDA support to import and supply drought-tolerant and rust-
resistant varieties of wheat seeds to compensate for the limited capacity of the domestic seed 
industry. Recently, the government has taken concrete actions to reduce its intervention in 
production as well as to resolve the cotton farm debt that hinders agricultural growth. In the 
wake of the crisis, the government has been working steadily with donors to develop a broad-
based reform program and measures to remove policy distortions, strengthen land rights, and 
increase competition among ginneries and investors. A Presidential Decree for cotton debt 
resolution was promulgated and a government resolution and an action plan to resolve the cotton 
debt and reform the agriculture sector was approved (Box 2). The action plan will serve as the 
platform for developing and implementing agrarian reforms to ensure freedom to farm, 
accelerate efforts to ensure proper land titling, improve farmers’ access to finance and collateral 
practices, and increase returns to farmers and cotton sector recovery. The government is also 
committed to supporting sustainable agricultural development in the non-cotton sub-sector, 
including irrigation and drainage infrastructure and institutions, rural finance services, and farm 

17 

 
 
input markets. This is because non-cotton sector products from household plots, especially staple 
food commodities (cereals, meat, milk, vegetables, and potatoes) have recently emerged as a 
main driver of agricultural growth for the immediate future. They are relatively low cost 
commodities to produce, have significant potential to raise the current level of productivity, and 
can be readily sold in domestic markets. Going forward, the Bank will support the government in 
the implementation of the action plan together with the strategy to strengthen the non-cotton sub-
sector. 

44.
The government is planning to take on a new agenda to strengthen natural disaster 
risk management, weather forecasting, and climate change adaptation to reduce 
vulnerability and thus increase agricultural output. Because of its geography, topography and 
climate, Tajikistan is regularly affected by natural disasters such as floods, mudflows, landslides, 
avalanches, earthquakes, droughts and epidemics. Climate change is expected to exacerbate 
natural disasters associated with hydro-meteorological conditions, with associated damages 
affecting the rural economy disproportionately. The government recognizes that reducing 
environmental disaster risks is key to mitigating macroeconomic risks and improving welfare. 

18 

 
 
 
 
 
Box 2:  Progress in Addressing Constraints to Expanding Agricultural Capacity in Tajikistan 

The agriculture sector is composed of two sub-sectors, each of which is regulated by its own policy framework.
The cotton sector accounts for 65 percent of arable land and 75 percent of irrigated arable land but only about 9 percent 
of agriculture value added. The policy framework for the non-cotton sector is more open, but government support is 
minimal. Recent trends are instructive: the cotton sector has performed poorly and cotton producers are the poorest and 
most food-insecure people in rural areas, while the non-cotton sector has grown steadily. The government is working to 
expand agricultural capacity by resolving the cotton farm debt, reducing government intervention, encouraging financing 
decision by farmers, and improving the security of land tenure.  
The government is actively implementing policy reform to address the underlying structural problems in the 
cotton sector. A small group of powerful cotton financiers had required farmers’ to provide raw cotton at low prices in 
return for financing. Local government authorities facilitated this system by coercing farmers to grow cotton rather than 
other crops, and by minimizing the competition faced by favored cotton investors. The local and regional monopsonies 
thus created have stifled competition in the sector, decreased farm profitability, reduced producer incentives to raise 
output, inhibited the growth of alternative sources of rural finance, and slowed the development of alternative markets for 
farm inputs and cotton output. As a result, cotton production has declined markedly since 2004, and returns to farmers 
have fallen. Overdue (internal) farmer debt to investors has grown to an alleged US$ 435 million. The government’s 
attempt to sustain this system by facilitating investor access to external credit through the NBT has undermined the 
external debt sustainability. The government and donors are working steadily to remove policy distortions, strengthen 
land rights, and increase competition among ginneries and investors - as the basis for increasing returns to farmers and 
fostering cotton sector recovery.  
The farm debt write-off will enable farmers to borrow from commercial banks as they would no longer be 
indebted to investors. In line with the commitments made under the IMF’s new Extended Credit Facility (ECF) 
program, the government has recently approved an action plan to write off the debt owed by farmers to cotton ginneries 
(“investors”) and commercial banks.. Investors who obtained finance through the government-backed scheme will be 
obliged to take this loss in full. Non-cotton loans made by investors will be repaid to the NBT at concessional rates. The 
farm debt owed by farmers to cotton ginneries (“investors”) and commercial banks will be assumed by the government 
after debt-restructuring.. Within the next six months each individual farmer will be issued a certificate that states that he 
is free from any debt.  
The disclosure of the IMF misreporting sheds light on the unsustainability of existing state financing of the cotton 
sector, underscoring the need for alternative financing mechanisms. The NBT ceased to fund private sector cotton 
investors in 2008, and cotton export licensing was abolished. The government introduced a temporary and ad hoc cotton 
financing mechanism through which it extends domestic credit financed by the budget to commercial banks to on-lend to 
cotton farmers. These credits amounted to 140 and 180 million somoni in 2008 and 2009, respectively. The new 
mechanism raises concerns about fiscal burden and risk to the banking system, so the government with donor support is 
now implementing a private financing mechanism through which commercial banks extend credit to farmers based on 
their profitability (Tajikistan’s Agricultural Finance Facility) as supported by EBRD and the Bank Group.  
The government’s cotton sector interventions have declined gradually and competition has increased. The 
government traditionally intervened in agricultural production by enforcing cotton production targets and confiscating 
land that was used “irrationally.” These restrictions made it difficult for farmers to switch production out of cotton into 
more profitable agricultural activities, thus inhibiting agricultural growth. In response, has begun implementing a Cotton 
Farm Debt Resolution and Action Plan (Decree 111 and Decree 312) to assure the right of farmers to use their land as 
they choose (“freedom to farm”) and has established open competition among the processors and exporters who buy the 
harvest. Competition has increased, with the market share of the largest five cotton investors falling dramatically and 75 
investors exporting about 60 percent of cotton fiber. A 2009 farm survey found that local government intervention in 
cropping decisions has decreased steadily, especially in the Khatlon region.  
Land certificates are being issued at a faster pace to increase farmers’ access to land. Since the beginning of 2009, 
the number of properly registered collective dehqon farms has grown to 41,093, almost double the number in 2005 
(23,322). Land use choices are still constrained, however, as is the transfer of land through sale. Lease and mortgage 
practices are underdeveloped and convoluted. Together, these factors prevent farmers from choosing crops based on 
market forces and managing land sustainably. Farm restructuring is needed to strengthen farmer independence, but this 
has been delayed by political and technical constraints, especially in cotton-growing areas.

Improving energy sector performance is a priority for sustainable economic growth.  
Tajikistan’s hydropower potential is estimated at about 140 GW with an annual generation 
capacity of 527 TWh, of which only 5 percent is developed. The country’s domestic energy 
consumption is therefore met quasi totally by hydropower which represents 97 percent of the 
electricity production. About one-third of the electricity is consumed by the aluminum company 
TALCO, which has key importance for socio-economic development of the country. The energy 
infrastructure inherited from the Soviet era is deteriorating rapidly and costly to maintain. Low 
tariffs and blanket subsidization of power prices contribute to waste of electricity and fail even to 
cover operation and maintenance costs further contributing to the deterioration of the antiquated 
assets. Moreover, the energy system is also affected by high technical losses. Corporate 
governance among energy SOEs (Barki Tajik and Tajiktransgas) has improved in the last few 
years but remains weak due to low institutional capacity and by slow progress in improving 
transparency and accountability in financial management and operation. 

46.
The increased dependence on hydropower after the breakup of the Soviet Union led 
to increased vulnerability of the system owing to the seasonal variability of water flows. 
Tajik authorities estimated that generation deficit during winter months is in the range of 2.5 to 3 
TWh (about 20 to 23 percent of the total electricity consumption in 2008) and the generation in 
excess of domestic demand in the summer is about 2.5 TWh because reservoirs are managed to 
meet irrigation needs of downstream neighbors, according to water sharing agreements dating 
back to the Soviet era. The country faced severe energy shortages during the past few years due 
to the collapse of the previous working mechanism for water and energy exchange. The recent 
disconnection of the Tajik power system from the Central Asia Power System (CAPS) will likely 
increase the vulnerability of the fragile and now weakened power system. 

47.
The 2007 power sector strategy developed by the Government of Tajikistan aims to 
ensure reliable electricity supply to meet the needs of the population and productive sectors 
to sustain growth and contribute to poverty reduction. The target is to become self-reliant by 
the year 2017 and gradually develop power exports and strengthen regional cooperation to 
increase electricity export revenues and generate a new source of growth. The three pronged 
strategy focuses on: 

(cid:120) Reducing energy waste and rationalizing demand. Actions taken to date include 
significant tariff increases (an increase of about 250 percent from 2007 to late 2009) – 
even though sales prices remain well below costs of supply. Under the First Phase of the 
Energy Loss Reduction Project the following works have been performed: installation of 
electric meters, cabling, the replacement of transformers which resulted in significant 
increase of payments, and implementation of some measures to optimize and increase 
functionality of Dushanbe distribution network. There has also been extensive 
deployment of compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) to reduce lighting peak loads.   

(cid:120) Rehabilitating and modernizing existing assets to increase electricity supply. After the 
completion of the Sangtuda I and II, several small hydropower plants are being 
constructed and planned, the rehabilitation of key hydropower facilities built during the 
Soviet era are being evaluated, and the rehabilitation of the underground work of the 
Rogun hydropower plant has been initiated. 

20 

 
 
(cid:120) Attracting private and donor funding to develop hydropower and regional transmission 
infrastructure to develop export markets and generate stable revenues that would 
contribute sustained growth.  

(cid:120) Prioritizing construction of transmission lines for their connection to the national grid 
(about 300 km), including PTL 500 kV Dushanbe–Sangtuda I, enhancing the national 
dispatch center with SCADA, and construction of PTL 220 kV Khujand-Aini with 
substations.   

48.
Rehabilitation of Rogun Hydro Power Plant has resumed since 2008. The 
construction of the Rogun HPP is of the highest strategic importance to address Tajikistan’s 
energy deficit and thus lay the foundation for future growth and poverty reduction through 
employment generation. Work on the project, which was initiated in 1983 and substantially 
damaged by a flood in 1993, was resumed in 2008 with a view to rehabilitate the project site to 
its pre-1993 status and to commission the first two turbines by 2014. The government has 
recently established Rogun Open Joint Stock Company (Rogun OJSC) with an authorized capital 
of SM 6 billion that will be state owned for 75 percent. The remaining 25 percent of the shares 
(SM 1.5 billion) is currently being sold to the public that so far has contributed SM 800 million 
(USD 180 million). The government’s share will be paid for by budget transfers throughout the 
construction contingent to the preparation of a sound financial plan. Recently, the government 
has reached an agreement with the IMF in the context of the ongoing ECF to suspend public 
campaign for share sale to the population. Further share sale will be reassessed against the 
financing options of the country and the outcome of the WB economic and social and 
environmental studies. To ensure full transparency and a strong governance structure for the 
Rogun project, the government is planning to set up a supervisory board to oversee all financial 
aspects of the Rogun OJSC. It will publish regularly report to the public about the sources and 
uses of funds, including detailed information on the contractors hired by Rogun OJSC, their 
ownership structure, and the bidding process used to award all contracts. 

49.
As part of its efforts to meet health care MDGs, the government intends to improve 
access to safe water. Evidence shows that a high rate of infant mortality is highly correlated 
with limited access to safe water.17 According to the 2007 TLSS, 38 percent of respondents rely 
mainly on lakes, streams, rivers, or unprotected wells for drinking water, especially in rural 
areas. Given high rates of contamination among these water sources, this situation compromises 
health outcomes through high risk of gastric illness, cholera, and typhoid. Coverage of water 
supply services is reported to be 59 percent nationwide (93 percent in urban areas and 47 percent 
in rural areas). Service hours in urban areas have declined, and bacteriological water quality is no 
longer safe. In rural areas, many systems are inoperative due to the lack of maintenance and 
trained operators. Piped wastewater collection reaches about 15 percent of the population (44 
percent in urban areas and 3 percent in rural areas), reflecting very little improvement over the 
past two decades. Many wastewater treatment plants operate at reduced capacity, which lowers 
treatment efficiency. To meet its MDG targets by 2015, Tajikistan would need to increase 
coverage of safe water supply services to 79 percent of the total population—a target that is 
made even more difficult to reach by high population growth rates. With the support of the Bank 
and other development partners (the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development

(EBRD) and the Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau – Entwicklungsbank (KfW Development 
Bank)), the government is in the process of rehabilitating the water supply and sewage system in 
the main urban areas. 

50.
Strengthening Tajikistan’s stock of human capital will be a significant challenge 
with important implications for medium-term growth. Insufficient and inequitable allocation 
of public resources to the education and health sectors, together with the exodus of workers 
overseas due to limited job opportunities and low wages, has contributed to an acute skill 
shortage in the country and thus to a lowering of productive capacity and support for private 
sector growth. The government’s anti-crisis action plan includes a small training program for 
returned migrants as well as a small public works program to create jobs. The government is 
committed to increasing social spending in order to maintain poor people’s access to basic social 
services in a time of crisis and to deepening institutional and policy reforms in the social sectors 
in order to strengthen human capital. 

IV. WORLD BANK GROUP ENGAGEMENT  

A. Bank Group Track Record 

i. Portfolio performance 

51.
The size of the Bank’s portfolio has remained stable over the last four years, with 
the agriculture, energy, and water supply infrastructure sectors receiving almost 70 
percent of total financing. During FY06-09, the portfolio included an average of 15 investment 
projects and one development policy operation (DPO) each year. At the end of FY09, the 
portfolio consisted of 16 investments, with commitments amounting to US$187.5 million, of 
which about US$102 million were grants (IDA, Global Environment Facility (GEF), and trust 
funds). About 60 percent of outstanding commitments have been disbursed. An Emergency Food 
Crisis Grant of US$5 million and a DPO of US$20 million were fully disbursed in FY09. The 
average portfolio age is 4.1 years. The largest share of the portfolio is in agriculture (31 percent), 
followed by energy and water supply infrastructure (20 percent each), education (16 percent), 
health (8 percent), and public sector (5 percent). Ongoing IDA operations in education and 
agriculture are complemented by two stand-alone projects financed out of Bank-administered 
trust funds for a total of US$23.4 million.18 Trust funds form an important part of the Bank’s 
Tajikistan portfolio, amounting to US$60.4 million in active commitments. Sectors of focus 
include health, education, food security, private and financial sector development, agriculture, 
and energy.  

52.
The pace of IDA financing has picked up, and portfolio risks have been mitigated. 
The financing of the previous CPS has included both grants and loans, as the debt sustainability 
outlook changed during the CPS period. The disbursement ratio increased from about 18 percent 
during FY07-08 to 40 percent at the end of FY09, the highest in the ECA region (for which the 
average is 16.6 percent). In tandem with the acceleration of project implementation, 

18 These include the Education for All Fast-Track Initiative (EFA-FTI, US$18.4 million) and the fully disbursed 
Food Security and Seeds Import Project (US$5 million) financed out of the Food Price Crisis Trust Fund.  

22 

 
 
                                                 
commitments at risk intensified from 5.6 percent in FY07 to 28.5 percent in FY09. The rising 
number of problem projects was largely attributed to difficulties in implementing project-related 
structural reforms and slow progress in building implementation capacity. Thanks to regular 
Country Portfolio Performance Reviews (CPPR), the 2008 Country Portfolio Fiduciary Review 
(CPFR) and close monitoring by the country team, problems have been addressed within 12 
months and non-performing projects were restructured before the end of FY09.19  

53.
Since 2004, Country Portfolio Performance Reviews (CPPRs) have been carried out 
with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and joint action plans have been implemented.20 
The most recent joint portfolio review (December 2009) focused mainly on improving the 
implementation of ongoing operations and ensuring development impact and sustainability of the 
Bank’s operations. The review recommended the following: (i) strengthening the capacity of 
implementing agencies, especially procurement, financial management, and monitoring and 
evaluation; and (ii) ensuring retention of capacities in the implementing agencies with a view to 
enable line ministries to implement projects in the long term and ensure sustainability of the 
Bank’s operations.  

54.
The 2008 CPFR revealed that the great majority of Bank-financed projects were 
being managed satisfactorily. However, a number of deficiencies were noted in physical 
inspections of civil works in nine projects, which is an area that has not received adequate 
attention during project supervision. The review also highlighted weaknesses in contract 
management, systems and procedures, staff capacity, and understanding of Bank requirements 
and procedures for procurement, disbursement, and financial management. It was noted that 
capacity in PIUs was generally stronger, as these units were able to attract better-qualified and 
more experienced staff. On the other hand, projects implemented directly by recipient agencies 
faced greater capacity constraints and lower performance standards. Addressing these 
weaknesses in project implementing agencies will be a priority during the CPS period. In 
addition, as Tajikistan’s overall governance environment continues to pose risks to the 
effectiveness of Bank operations, the CPS program will work to manage country-level fiduciary 
risks and improve transparency in public financial management. At the project level, the Bank 
will mitigate these risks through implementation of the newly developed CGAC strategy (Annex 
3), including through the use of a Governance Checklist to ensure that fiduciary and other 
governance considerations are integrated into program design and supervision.  

55.
IDA will regularly monitor its portfolio through follow-up fiduciary reviews, and 
procurement and financial management training will be provided to the PIUs. Efforts will 
also be made to manage fiduciary risks in trust-funded activities, including by better integrating 
PIUs and implementing agencies, strengthening supervision, and ensuring that these activities do 
not overwhelm limited administrative capacity. 

19 The pro-activity index at the beginning of FY10 is 100 percent, which means that within 12 months after a project 
was rated unsatisfactory, appropriate action was taken. In FY2008, problem projects were Land Cadastre, Dushanbe 
Water Supply, and Cotton Sector Recovery. Potential problem projects were Avian Flu Risk Mitigation and Energy 
Emergency. The Dushanbe Water Supply, Land Cadastre projects, and Avian Flu were restructured in June, July, 
and December 2009, respectively. The Cotton Sector Recovery was restructured in March 2010. 
20 Implementation of the detailed action plan developed jointly by the Government of Tajikistan, ADB and WB 
(approved in December 2008) is being monitored closely and serves as the basis for tracking performance of the 
ongoing portfolio. 

23 

 
 
                                                 
56.
IFC’s investment and advisory services portfolio has continued to expand, with 
strong results. In FY05-09, IFC invested a total of US$32.0 million in ten projects.  Of this 
amount, US$23.0 million was in 8 projects in the financial sector, including US$6.3 million for 
microfinance.  In addition, IFC approved US$2.5 million trade finance to Eskhata Bank under its 
Global Trade Finance Facility.  In the real sectors, IFC invested US$9 million in two projects in 
the energy and hotel sectors.  IFC commitments grew strongly in recent years, reaching around 
US$16 million in both FY08 and FY09 (from less than US$1 million in previous years).  
Investment projects have provided access to finance for micro, small and medium enterprises 
(MSMEs); strengthened access to electricity in remote areas; and created jobs. Advisory Services 
(AS) spending has grown to nearly US$3 million annually, with demonstrable results in the 
financial sector and policy arenas. The Tajikistan leasing portfolio across all financial institutions 
grew by 860 percent from 2006 to 2008, reaching US$21.7 million. AS projects made significant 
contributions to the passage of the Inspections Law, Mortgage Law, and Credit History Law, and 
implementation of simplified taxation mechanisms. IFC manages US$11.8 million in active trust 
fund commitments, focusing on 
the business enabling environment, SMEs, banking, 
microfinance, and agricultural finance.   

57.
IFC’s engagement in Tajikistan is limited by the size of potential investments and 
high levels of public ownership and control of private sector enterprises, but combining 
investment and AS is addressing these challenges. IFC’s global expertise, together with a 
significant local and regional presence, is a strong formula for results in an IDA country such as 
Tajikistan. Business environment reforms take several years of advisory and implementation 
assistance to show results. For example, after many years of working on inspection reforms, the 
Business Enabling Environment Bank (BEE) project is finally beginning to produce concrete 
results for businesses. Similarly, success on the Leasing and Mortgage Laws has or is expected 
to pave the way for expansion of these markets. On the other hand, with a relatively undeveloped 
manufacturing and industrial base, investment and AS in the real sectors is a continuing 
challenge. 

ii. Implementation of the last CPS   

58.
Implementation of the CPS program for FY06-09 has proceeded largely on track, 
albeit with some delays. The mix of investment and development policy operations has been 
consistent with the CPS, though the program has been modified at the margin based on 
government requests and emerging needs. For example, given strong progress on poverty 
reduction, the government felt that another poverty alleviation operation was unnecessary and 
Poverty Alleviation III was cancelled. Instead, additional financing was provided to three 
existing operations (Community and Basic Health Project (CBHP), Pamir Private Energy, and 
Dushanbe Water Supply). In 2008 three new emergency projects were launched in response to 
the energy and food crises: the Energy Emergency Recovery financed out of unallocated IDA14 
and the Emergency Food Security and Seed Imports and additional financing to CBHP financed 
by the Food Price Crisis Trust Fund. Preparation and delivery of some operations (treasury 
modernization, sector-wide approach (SWAp) for education) took longer than expected due to 
operational complexities, donor coordination delays, and government capacity limitations. The 
Health SWAp under preparation was postponed due to limited IDA funding, and half the 
allocation envisioned in the previous CPS was reallocated as additional financing for the CBHP 
in 2009.  

24 

 
 
59.
A series of Programmatic Development Policy Grants (PDPG) drove policy dialogue 
with the government and helped coordinate implementation of the CPS program. As such, 
the PDPG contributed to the achievement of a significant share of CPS results in coordination 
with IDA sector departments, IFC, and other development partners. Its agenda was broad, 
touching on all of the core areas of the CPS, including private sector development, agriculture, 
energy, education and health services, public sector reform, and public financial management. 
PDPG implementation was most successful in areas that benefited from strong government 
ownership, complementary technical assistance, consensus among development partners on the 
way forward and long-term engagement on the part of the Bank Group.21 Drawing from this 
experience, continued PDPG implementation is expected to help deepen progress on the 
country’s ongoing reform agenda and to support reforms in emerging areas. 

60.
Analytical and advisory activities (AAA) have helped understand and demonstrate 
the benefits of reform in areas where there is limited buy-in from the authorities. A policy 
note on aviation paved the way for Bank Group engagement on removing constraints to 
accessing Tajikistan by air. The 2007 and 2008 Programmatic Public Expenditure Reviews 
(PPERs) have underpinned coordination with other donors working in the social sectors 
(education, health, and social protection) and thus helped improve public service delivery by 
strengthening linkages between sector policies and budgeting. A Poverty Assessment and 
subsequent update, based on the 2007 TLSS, have shed light on the nature and extent of poverty 
in Tajikistan, helping to target assistance programs to those most in need—particularly in the 
context of the ongoing crisis. The effectiveness of some AAA has been constrained, however, by 
delays in delivery and uptake due to weak planning on the part of the Bank team. 

61.
Though many of the results anticipated in the CPS have been achieved, it has 
become clear that some objectives were somewhat ambitious given limited capacity and 
weak government commitment to structural reforms in Tajikistan. The impact of the first 
pillar—fostering broad-based growth in urban and rural areas—has been moderate, with some 
progress in improving the business climate and enhancing access to finance. The gains that have 
been made are at risk due to the global crisis and the government’s policy of financing the cotton 
sector through banks. Agricultural reforms remain incomplete, though cotton-grading standards 
have been introduced and the practice of cotton exports licensing by the NBT has been 
eliminated. Objectives under the second pillar—preserving and enhancing the quality of health 
and education—have been met for the most part. School attendance and completion rates, and 
provision of health services have improved in regions where the Bank has provided support. In 
the health sector, however, high out-of-pocket payments, combined with increasing hardship as a 
result of the economic crisis, have caused utilization of health services in project areas to decline. 
Access to clean water has improved in Dushanbe, but preliminary data suggest that overall 
access has not changed since 2003. Objectives under the third pillar—improving delivery of 
energy services and exploiting the country’s hydropower potential—were partially achieved. The 
poor quality of energy supplies for the domestic market and weak corporate governance in the 
energy and water sectors continues to constrain production. Though good progress has been 

21 An Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICRR) for the Tajikistan PDPG is under preparation and will 
provide a thorough assessment of the program’s contribution to the country’s reform agenda in a difficult 
environment.

made in developing a regional energy market, further large hydropower investments will be 
required together with regional diplomatic initiatives to address geopolitical concerns.  

62.
CPS 
interventions to 
improve governance and state capacity were below 
expectations. The CPS emphasized governance and capacity building as crosscutting themes, 
but interventions were limited to working with the central government. Some progress has been 
made, in particular on civil service wage reform and recruitment, adoption of a public financial 
management strategy, and promulgation of a new procurement law. Progress on public sector 
restructuring has been less noticeable given the lack of an appropriate counterpart for the 
overhaul that was envisaged. In general, the impact of the CPS program on the broader 
governance picture in Tajikistan has been minimal.   

63.
The main lesson learned from CPS implementation is not to overburden an 
administration that suffers from poor capacity in planning, coordination, and execution 
with an ambitious agenda. Moderate realism in program design, combined with strict 
prioritization, can go a long way in ensuring the prompt delivery of results. A selective approach 
helps to scale down overambitious goals, manage expectations, identify sources of risk, and 
provide effective, appropriate capacity building support. While additional legal amendments in 
selected areas will continue to be necessary, the next strategy should focus on implementing the 
laws and strategies already in place, and, when trying to arrive at new institutional frameworks, 
draw first on experimentation and dialogue rather than imposing new designs before attaining 
sufficient understanding and buy-in from the authorities. 

64.
The CPS Completion Report (Annex 5) completed in October 2009 provides
strategic and operational recommendations for the preparation of a new CPS. While both 
the CPS agenda and the government’s 2007 PRS remain valid, the current global crisis has added 
new urgencies that must be addressed within a long-term framework to prevent the recurrence of 
slippages that took place over the last four years. Strategically, the CPSCR recommends that the 
new CPS review the relevance and adequacy of ongoing operations and focus on achieving 
realistic results in the context of current economic challenges and the country’s capacity to meet 
them. The new CPS should thus aim to help Tajikistan develop the capacity to address shocks, 
rebuild credibility and strengthen governance, increase energy potential, enable private sector 
development, and consolidate fragile gains in health and education by further strengthening the 
relevant ministries and scaling up successful pilot initiatives. Operationally, the CPSCR 
recommends that the new CPS pursue greater selectivity; embed the capacity development and 
governance agendas fully into sector work and, where necessary, assess ownership and 
commitment capacity through political economy analysis; retain the mix of budget support and 
investment operations; disseminate the results of AAA to generate broad public understanding of 
and support for reforms; and adopt a gradual approach to harmonization among development 
partners in order to improve implementation performance and reduce costs. The CPS experience 
shows that reforms can be achieved under a program that is well targeted with well-defined 
outcomes, and that is underpinned by solid AAA, TA, and sufficient time and resources 
dedicated to policy dialogue and capacity development.  

26 

 
 
B. Proposed WBG Strategy

i. CPS objectives  
65.
In 
line with government priorities and the 
lessons 
learned through past 
implementation, the CPS is designed to focus on two objectives: (i) reducing the negative 
impact of the crisis on poverty and vulnerability; and (ii) paving the way for post-crisis recovery 
and sustained development. In order to support sustainable progress toward these objectives, 
efforts to improve core governance will be tackled directly and also mainstreamed across the 
CPS program within the context of the CGAC strategy (Annex 3). Attention to capacity 
development and gender equality will be mainstreamed across sectors and projects. 

66.
The CPS will rely on a mix of instruments, including the continuation of the PDPG 
series, investment activities, and targeted AAA. Selectivity within and across sectors, and 
according to the Bank Group’s comparative advantage in relation to other development partners, 
will be critical given the limited resources available. The indicative IDA15 allocation for 
Tajikistan is projected to be about US$86.6 million (SDR 55.9 million), about 13 percent lower, 
in absolute terms, than under IDA14 (SDR 64.6 million). About US$30 million of the IDA15 
envelope was allocated in FY09 to implementation of the CPS for FY06-09. The remaining 
allocation (about US$57 million) will finance the first two years of the CPS. More than half the 
IDA15 allocation will support the PDPG, and the remainder will be distributed across investment 
activities. Trust funds, which will almost match the IDA allocation in FY10-11, will continue to 
play an important role in supporting the CPS program. In addition to these resources, Tajikistan 
will receive additional funding equivalent to US$23.4 million (SDR 15.3 million) in FY10 from 
the IDA Crisis Window to address the impacts of the global crisis and it may be eligible to 
access IDA regional funds and IBRD enclave loans for economically viable infrastructure.

ii. Expected CPS results 
The expected results of the proposed CPS program are listed in Table 3 below.

10. Improve transparency and accountability in public financial management 

27 

 
 
 
 
 
68.
Governance reforms cut across the entire CPS program. The Bank Group’s 
governance interventions will take three forms: (i) transparency and accountability measures; (ii) 
capacity development; and (iii) supporting demand for good governance. These interventions 
will be carried out at the country, sector, and project levels. This approach to “mainstreaming” 
governance reform has been developed in response to lessons learned under the previous CPS, 
where efforts to address governance were restricted to the central government level and not well 
integrated into sector approaches or individual program design. Mainstreaming does not mean 
abandoning central-level governance reforms, but complementing them with an equal emphasis 
on sector- and project-level interventions. While core governance initiatives such as public sector 
reform and public financial management will be tackled directly at the country level, Bank 
support to governance reforms at the sector level will be mainstreamed across all expected CPS 
results with heightened attention to priority areas (private and financial sector development, 
agriculture, and energy). At the project level, the Bank will apply a Governance Checklist to all 
new projects and additional financing throughout the project cycle in order to ensure that project 
design helps strengthen transparency, accountability, capacity, and demand for good governance, 
while safeguarding against political economy and fiduciary risks.  

Objective I: Reduce the negative impact of the crisis on poverty and vulnerability

69.
Result 1: Maintain macroeconomic stability. Macroeconomic stability is a prerequisite 
for both short-term economic viability and medium-term recovery. The CPS program, jointly 
with the IMF’s ECF, will help Tajikistan develop and maintain a positive track record of stable 
macroeconomic management to bolster investor confidence in the economy’s potential. The CPS 
will provide financial support and TA on fiscal and expenditure management to help the country 
address the ongoing economic crisis in the context of limited fiscal space and without harming 
its debt sustainability. This will contribute to strengthening governance by supporting the 
development of central government capacity to transparently manage its finances. IFC will 
contribute to macroeconomic stability through direct investment in the real economy, as well as 
through investments in financial institutions to expand access to finance for MSMEs in order to 
help maintain and create jobs, support trade finance, and attract further foreign investment, thus 
creating demonstration effects for other investors.(cid:3)

70.
Result 2: Maintain access to critical public services. There is an urgent need to ensure 
that access to education and health services is preserved during the economic crisis, especially 
for the poorest segments of the population. Through the PDPG, IDA will provide budget support 
to help the government protect pro-poor spending in the education and health sectors, focusing 
resources on the most critical areas of basic and general education and primary health care 
(PHC). The Education Modernization project and the Education for All-Fast Track Initiative 
Catalytic Fund (EFA-FTI CF) are helping to maintain access to education through the 
rehabilitation of school infrastructure, provision of higher-quality equipment and textbooks, 
upgrading of personnel capacity, improvement of management capacity, and strengthening of 
education spending efficiency. Additional financing provided to the CBHP will scale up efforts 
to introduce capitation and output-based payments for PHC, building on reforms financed by the 
United States Agency for International Development (USAID). In addition, the project will 
rehabilitate PHC facilities in selected areas and expand training of doctors and nurses. Efforts to 

28 

 
 
improve the efficiency and transparency of spending on education and health will also support 
the governance agenda. 

71.
Result 3: Reduce risk for vulnerable groups through enhanced social protection. To 
mitigate the vulnerability of poor people during the crisis, the CPS will support efforts to reduce 
food insecurity, create short-term employment opportunities, and strengthen management of the 
social protection system. To support the immediate food security of the poorest farmers and 
female-headed households and help these groups recover production losses, IDA will allocate 
additional financing to the Food Security and Seed Import project to provide inputs needed for 
agricultural production and livestock management. The Second Community Agriculture and 
Watershed Management project will help provide rural people in uplands (non-cotton growing) 
areas with investment capital and skills needed to increase agricultural yields. The CPS will also 
support activities to generate jobs and income, especially in rural areas. Additional financing 
provided to the Ferghana Valley Water Resources Management project and a new Emergency 
Employment program, financed by the EC and administered by IDA, will support rehabilitation 
of irrigation and drainage systems, thus creating short-term employment in key areas of the 
country. In addition, it will support the development, adoption, and implementation of an 
integrated policy and institutional reforms necessary for the effective management of the 
country’s water resources through strengthening the linkages between the agriculture 
development and water 
resource management strategies 
to ensure sustainable and 
environmentally friendly development. Finally, IDA will provide TA to improve targeting and 
administration of the safety net system as a whole, and to strengthen administration and capacity 
for pension policymaking. The TA will be designed to complement PDPG support for the 
development of a methodology for effectively targeting social assistance. IDA will also 
collaborate with the EC to assist the government in developing and implementing a social 
protection strategy. Efforts to increase coverage and reduce leakage in social protection benefits 
will bolster governance reforms. 

Objective II: Pave the way for post-crisis recovery and sustained development(cid:3)

72.
Result 4: Strengthen the business-enabling environment. The Bank Group will 
continue to support government initiatives to improve Tajikistan’s Doing Business ranking. The 
IFC’s BEE project seeks to reduce administrative barriers in inspections and permits and to 
lower tax compliance costs by simplifying tax administration. The IFC BEE project is working 
with the government to significantly reduce the number of permits applied to businesses through 
a quick review methodology, generating cost savings for the private sector and setting the 
groundwork for Regulatory Impact Assessment in Tajikistan. Through its Agri-Finance and 
Business Environment program, IFC will help strengthen the regulatory framework for private 
investment, improve access to finance for agri-business via investments in financial institutions 
(banks and microfinance institutions), and support leasing development. The project will work 
with financial institutions to build capacity to evaluate credit for medium-term leasing and 
equipment finance products, resulting in improved access to finance and equipment for 
agribusiness to improve productivity. Governance reforms related to private sector regulation are 
critical to fostering private sector growth and employment creation. The IFC infrastructure 
advisory service’s assistance in conducting an international tender for the exploration and 
development of the Bolshoi Konimansur silver deposits is intended to have demonstration effects 

29 

 
 
for the transparency of the broader international tender process, thus helping to attract the foreign 
investment needed for large infrastructure projects. IDA will work with other development 
partners to strengthen the capacity of the State Property and Investment Committee through 
ongoing TA. IDA will also work - in collaboration with the UK DFID and the Doing Business 
Reform Advisory Team - with the relevant Tajik institutions to simplify business start-up, 
construction permits, property registration, and border trading procedures that are instrumental 
for private sector development in Tajikistan. IDA will also work with the relevant institutions to 
simplify construction permits, property registration, and border trading procedures that are 
instrumental for private sector development in Tajikistan. The multi-year PDPG will provide the 
framework for policy dialogue to push these reforms forward.22 IDA will also explore the growth 
potential of the mining sector, conducting a mining institutional assessment through a grant from 
the Institutional Development Fund, reviewing the mining law, and undertaking in-depth mining 
sector reforms under the PDPG. (cid:3)

73.
In the financial sector, the immediate priority is to strengthen governance of the 
NBT by increasing its capacity and restoring its credibility in full. Through a grant from the 
Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening (FIRST) Initiative, IDA will continue to provide TA 
to help improve financial stability and strengthen access to financial services; IDA may also 
support a project on strengthening access to finance, if warranted on the basis of a planned rural 
investment climate assessment (RICA).23 IDA will help the authorities finalize and implement a 
medium-term financial sector development strategy and action plan, drawing upon the 
recommendations of the 2008 FSAP and focusing on sustained improvements in the legal and 
institutional framework. IFC will provide investment funds, including debt, equity, and trade 
finance to financial and microfinance institutions. IFC will provide AS on financial risk 
management, credit management, and development of a private credit bureau. Over the medium 
term, IFC will work with the government to expand secure access to finance for individual 
consumers and MSMEs under the Azerbaijan and Central Asia Financial Markets Infrastructure 
project and Microfinance Transformation project. The Azerbaijan and Central Asia Financial 
Markets Infrastructure Project will increase the availability and use of credit information for 
financial institutions to evaluate borrowers; the Microfinance Transformation Project works with 
microfinance institutions that are existing or potential IFC investment clients to expand deposits 
and the range of financial services, leading to increased ability of microfinance institutions to 
raise funds in the market. 

74.
Result 5: Improve conditions for a sustainable increase in agricultural productivity.
The recent government resolution to resolve the outstanding cotton debt and enhance freedom to 
farm will help enable the realization of agricultural sector potential. These initiatives will also 
support efforts to lower rural poverty because cotton producers—particularly in the Khatlon and 
Sogd regions—are the poorest and most food insecure people in rural areas. The CPS will 
support efforts to develop a sustainable solution for rural finance, as the new cotton financing 
mechanism of on-lending budgetary funds to the agricultural sector through commercial banks 
poses considerable risks to the banking system and to agricultural sustainability. IDA will 

22 Key partners in this area include the EC, Swiss Economic Cooperation (SECO), United Kingdom Department for 
International Development (DFID), and USAID. 
23 The RICA will be carried out with support from DFID. 

30 

 
 
                                                 
support implementation of the government’s action plan to secure land use rights, eliminate 
government intervention in cotton production, and resolve farm debt. 

75.
Policy dialogue on these issues will be underpinned by AAA (including the RICA), 
PDPG, and existing investment operations on the Land Cadastre Registration System and Cotton 
Sector Recovery.24 The Bank Group will also increase its support to non-cotton areas. The 
Community Agriculture and Watershed Management project is working to reduce land 
degradation, soil erosion and water pollution.25 Additional financing will be provided to the 
Ferghana Valley Water Resources Management project to support the rehabilitation of irrigation 
and drainage systems, and a new Emergency Employment program will support government 
efforts to rehabilitate irrigation systems in Soghd and Khatlon oblasts. IFC’s Agri-Finance and 
Business Environment   project will continue to improve agricultural finance in the cotton sector, 
helping to support the governance agenda. IFC will also seek investments in private agri-
business companies.

76.
The improvement of agricultural productivity will depend in part on efforts to prevent, 
mitigate and adapt to disaster and climate change risks under the newly launched regional 
disaster risk mitigation (DRM) program. Tajikistan has been selected as one of nine pilot 
countries taking part in the Pilot Program on Climate Resilience (PPCR), which is expected to 
bring an additional fund about US$35 million in grant resources to support initiatives such as 
drought-proofing agricultural activities, strengthening resilience to climate change among 
vulnerable rural populations, modernizing hydromet services, developing a water adaptation plan 
for the Amu Darya river basin, and reducing financial vulnerability (among households and in 
the broader economy) to the adverse impacts of disasters and climate change. Tajikistan is also 
one of three countries benefiting from a regional project, funded by the Global Facility for 
Disaster Risk Reduction (GFDRR), on improving weather and climate service delivery in high-
risk, low-income countries. CPS support for the elimination of hazardous Persistent Organic 
Pollutants (POPs) will help reduce the risk of land pollution and help Tajikistan meet obligations 
under the Stockholm Convention on POPs. 

77.
Result 6. Improve the reliability of electricity and gas services and increase energy 
support potential.  In the short run, IDA will continue to support government efforts to urgently 
increase the volume and reliability of energy supply through an additional financing to the 
Energy Emergency Recovery Assistance Project by pooling $15 million IDA funds with 
government budget and other donor resources to ensure reliable gas supply to the Dushanbe 
combined heat power (CHP) plant, electricity supply from commercial hydropower entities and 
electricity imports for the 2009-2010 and the 2010-2011 winters. IDA will continue supporting 
loss reduction in the power system through a follow up to the Energy Loss Reduction Project 
which will also strengthen Barki Tajik’s planning, financial management and operational 
functions. 

24 IDA’s Cotton Sector Recovery Project is being restructured to provide a credit line for post harvest finance and 
support to farmers to raise production through reputable commercial banks. 
25 These represent the three environmental issues with the most detrimental impact on GDP. See World Bank. 2008.  
Country Environmental Analysis.

78.
Developing hydropower in a responsible way will secure the country’s energy 
supply and gradually generate electricity export revenues. The World Bank recognizes the 
unique value hydropower brings to the Central Asia region. It also recognizes the close 
connections to difficult issues of water management, connections that are even more important in 
the context of climate change. As part of a regional program on energy and water, the World 
Bank will work with the Government of Tajikistan and regionally recognized institutions to 
strengthen the technical and institutional basis for cooperation on energy and water and, over 
time, for mutual economic, environmental and social benefits. In addition to regional benefits, 
this work will increase attractiveness of hydropower investments in Tajikistan and reduce risks 
related to water management. IFC will be examining hydropower investments in Tajikistan for 
potential investment. 

79.
The Bank and the government agreed to join efforts to revise and refine the 2007 
energy strategy and align it with the government’s long term objectives. The management of 
the isolated power system requires the development of stronger planning, engineering and 
operation functions in addition of reinforcement of commercial functions. The Bank has already 
incorporated capacity building in the projects under implementation at the country level and 
these efforts will be amplified in follow up projects under consideration. Complementary needs 
will be identified during the preparation of the energy strategy under preparation by the World 
Bank in cooperation with Tajik authorities and energy institutions. The World Bank Group and 
the Government of Tajikistan energy partnership will focus on: (a) electricity loss reduction, (b) 
improving energy system efficiency and security, and (c) development of hydropower resources 
of the country, including for the purpose of export. 

80.
In terms of engagement in large hydropower programs such as Rogun, the Bank is 
supporting the preparation of comprehensive technical, social and environmental 
assessments. Subject to confirmation of the project’s technical soundness, economic viability 
and compliance with all relevant environmental and social safeguards – the World Bank would 
consider leading the consortium to implement the Rogun project. Tajikistan has a significant 
potential to achieve increased production from the rehabilitation of existing hydropower 
facilities, such as Nurek and Karaikkum, and these programs will be evaluated further. Regional 
transmission programs for power exchange, such as CASA1000 and other transmission linkages 
would be evaluated and implemented. The World Bank Group is committed to ensuring that 
regional projects are proven to be economically, socially and environmentally sustainable at the 
regional level. To meet the funding requirements of many of these projects, the Bank would 
consider IBRD enclave loans, partial risk guarantees for projects that increase exports to reliable 
power off-takers in the region which could lead to sufficient credit enhancement for loan 
repayment. Hydropower projects with private sector participation and sufficient credit quality 
will be considered for IFC loans and equity participation. IFC also remains willing to support 
regional transmission projects with private sector participation, subject to their feasibility. The 
Bank plans to access Regional IDA resources for projects that strengthen regional cooperation 
and increase power exchange/trade leading to optimal use of resources. 

81.
Result 7: Improve the provision of safe water in Dushanbe and selected 
municipalities. Under the CPS, IDA will continue to improve access to safe water in the capital 
city (with a population of 600,000, one-quarter of Tajikistan’s urban population) through a 
repeater project, Dushanbe Water Supply. This operation will help reduce poverty through the 

32 

 
 
provision of continuous safe water. The program will also support governance improvements by 
reducing wastage and improving efficiency and transparency through extended metering of 
households, public institutions, and industries, and by strengthening the corporate governance of 
SOEs through the corporatization of the Dushanbe Municipal Vodokanal. Should the central 
government and Dushanbe municipal governments wish, the additional financing could also be 
used to strengthen the role of the private sector through outsourcing of selected functions to 
specialized private companies. These efforts will also help mitigate the economic crisis through 
employment generation. IDA will also provide additional financing 
to 
the ongoing 
Municipalities Development project to increase access to safe water in eight other municipalities. 

82.
Result 8: Strengthen the quality of public services to enhance human capital 
potential. In education, the government’s National Strategy for Education Development (NSED) 
for 2006-2015 and its associated action plan provide a common framework for a SWAp to be 
supported by development partners. In addition, IDA’s Education Modernization project will 
continue to support the institutionalization of fair and transparent student assessments, upgraded 
training modules for teachers, improved monitoring and evaluation, and policy reform. In 
parallel, the FTI CF26 will help scale up reform efforts supported by the previous CPS in 
education financing, school infrastructure rehabilitation, and education management. Key 
governance reforms in the education sector include increasing transparency and accountability 
through per capita financing, and improving fairness and transparency in university admissions 
through unified university entrance examination. Finally, the Bank is cooperating with Russia to 
implement a program to Improve Central Asian Migrants’ Life Skills, including improving their 
understanding of Russian labor regulations and procedures and building financial literacy. This 
initiative will give Tajikistan’s migrant workers a stronger understanding of their rights and raise 
their bargaining power and marketability abroad. 

83.
In health, the CPS will scale up ongoing efforts to improve the equitable allocation 
of resources and efficiency in health service provision, thus improving quality of care. 
Priorities include scaling up per capita financing for PHC, introducing output-based financing for 
hospitals, reforming payment systems in PHC centers and hospitals, rehabilitating infrastructure, 
and training medical and fiduciary staff in the Ministry of Health (MoH). These initiatives will 
help strengthen governance in the health sector through improved transparency and fiduciary 
capacity.  

26  In December 2005, the ECA-FTI CF agreed to grant US$18.4 million to Tajikistan in support of the NSED. The first-year 
allocation (FTI-1) of US$9.2 million was made available in mid-2006. The Ministry of Education (MoE) is implementing the 
second-year allocation (FTI-2) and is preparing an application package for the third year to be considered by the FTI-CF in 
October 2009.

Crosscutting Initiatives to Support CPS Objectives

84.
To achieve the above objectives, the CPS will place governance at center stage. 
Strengthening governance systems is crucial for ensuring long-term development effectiveness. 
In addition to direct, country-level work on public sector reform and public financial 
management (Results 9 and 10), governance will be mainstreamed in sectors and projects—
especially in agriculture, energy, and private and financial sector development—to support 
achievement of the objectives in the context of the CGAC strategy (Annex 3). Moreover, there is 
a need to better understand governance at all levels in Tajikistan. In this context, the CPS will 
carry out an Institutional and Governance Review (IGR) with a focus on national-subnational 
government relations, exploring the relationships between the institutional structure and 
governance outcomes, such as service delivery at the local level. The key sectors to explore the 
structure of national-subnational relations are energy, rural development, health and education. 
The CPS will also explore the potential for Tajikistan’s participation in the Extractive Industries 
Transparency Initiative (EITI), which promotes the publication and verification of company 
payments and government revenues from resource extraction. These initiatives represent critical 
steps along the long-term path to strengthening governance in Tajikistan. As shown in other 
countries with governance weaknesses, progress on governance reforms in Tajikistan will require 
patience and perseverance.  

85.
Result 9: Strengthen incentives for better performance of civil servants. The 
government is working to develop a new Law on the Organization of Public Administration, 
which will establish the hierarchy, competences, and accountability of public entities in 
Tajikistan. Functional reviews are planned in seven ministries, followed by the preparation of 
detailed institutional development plans by the end of 2010. The Bank will support these efforts 
through the ongoing Public Sector Reform project, though it is anticipated that progress will 
remain slow in the absence of a dedicated unit within central government that is responsible for 
leading and coordinating the reform effort. Under this CPS, the Bank will work with the 
government to achieve greater synergy between central public administration reforms and sector 
reforms aimed at strengthening the efficiency and effectiveness of social service delivery. This 
will be achieved through targeted institutional restructuring in the sectors, improved planning 
and budgeting, introduction of merit-based recruitment and performance appraisal systems 
linked to pay and career progression, and support for capacity building and accountability in the 
civil service. The PDPG will support policy actions in this area.

86.
Result 10: Strengthen transparency and accountability 
in public financial 
management. To help ensure that scarce public resources are used for their intended purposes, 
the Public Financial Management Modernization project will support reforms outlined in the 
action plan for the government’s Public Financial Management Reform Strategy. In 
collaboration with development partners, this project will focus on improving the basic building 
blocks of public financial management (budget preparation, budget execution, public accounting, 
and fiscal reporting); reforming business processes and institutional arrangements; and 
strengthening capacity. The PDPG will support the government’s ongoing efforts to strengthen 
transparency and accountability through the establishment of an independent external audit 
agency. IDA will work with the government to develop an information and communication 
technology (ICT) or “e-government” strategy to improve efficiency in public service 
provisioning using limited public resources. IDA’s work on public financial management and 

34 

 
 
SOE corporate governance will be undertaken in collaboration with the IMF’s ongoing ECF. A 
multi-donor trust fund on Public Finance Voice and Accountability (PFVA) will help create 
visible citizen demand for efficient and effective use of state finances to upgrade essential public 
services by strengthening Parliamentary oversight, media communication and citizen 
involvement in public finance and service delivery. 

87.
Recognizing the significant capacity constraints faced by the government, and their 
potential role in slowing implementation of the CPS program, the Bank Group will focus 
on capacity development and human capital formation across interventions. The CPS will 
continue existing efforts to build capacity in key ministries involved in the execution of CPS 
programs, focusing on both institutional reforms and skills training. Ongoing TA on 
macroeconomic management will be underpinned by training for civil servants on fiscal and 
expenditure management. Programs in the education sector will focus on strengthening policy 
development and management capacity within the Ministry of Education, together with training 
programs for teachers and migrant workers. Health sector initiatives will strengthen capacity to 
administer a basic package of health services at central and local levels. Work in the agriculture 
sectors will support training for communities on productive farming techniques, farmland 
restructuring, and micro-credit principles. Infrastructure development programs in energy and 
water will focus on strengthening technical and financial management capacity of relevant SOEs. 
Support for public sector reform and public financial management modernization will include 
substantial capacity development components, including development of new training modules 
on organizational management and human resources management, knowledge transfer and 
change management workshops, and in-service training to help improve the effectiveness and 
efficiency of public financial management in the public administration. Across the program, 
application of the Governance Checklist will ensure that the design and review of individual 
projects takes into account capacity development needs and opportunities. The World Bank 
Institute (WBI) will buttress the country team’s efforts to build capacity development into the 
design of specific projects and programs (paragraph 103). The CGAC strategy will review 
capacity development experience during the last CPS and provide recommendations for 
improved project-based capacity development results framework.  

88.
The CPS will also mainstream efforts to address gender disparity in Tajikistan, 
recognizing the important contribution that gender equality can make to economic growth 
and poverty reduction, and thereby the achievement of the MDGs. Gender disparities in 
Tajikistan are significant, despite existing legal frameworks intended to manage them. The ratio 
of female-headed households is high in Tajikistan as a result of the civil war, the migration of 
young men to other countries in search of work, and the lower life expectancy of male workers. 
Nearly 35 percent of Tajikistan’s migrant households and 17 percent of non-migrant households 
are headed by women. Female-headed households are highly dependent on remittances and thus 
more vulnerable to shocks. Though women account for half of the country’s active labor force, 
their participation is low and their earnings are lower than those of male workers, especially in 
agriculture where women are predominantly employed. Women’s access to land and finance is 
limited. In view of these obstacles, the CPS will seek to mainstream gender initiatives across 
elements of the program where gender disparities exist, including access to primary education, 
labor force participation and remuneration, and access to land and credit. Gender-related support 
will be included explicitly in relevant programs, and results will be measured through the 
collection and use of gender-disaggregated data where appropriate.   

35 

 
 
iii. CPS results framework 

89.
The results expected from CPS implementation will be influenced significantly by 
the ongoing investment portfolio. Seventeen projects are currently under implementation, with 
about US$62 million still to be disbursed as of March 31, 2010. New commitments under the 
CPS from regular IDA resources amount to US$ 140.4 million and from trust funds amount to 
US$57 million. New interventions will support the achievement of results in selected areas, 
including reducing vulnerability in the face of limited economic diversification and difficult 
geography. 

90.
The results matrix (Annex 1) is designed around clear principles: selectivity and 
measurability of indicators based on the availability and reliability of baseline data; and realism 
about the role of the Bank Group in contributing to the achievement of results. Anticipated 
results are closely linked to national strategies to demonstrate the proposed CPS program’s 
contribution to country development objectives. Where possible, results indicators have been 
clearly defined on the basis of monitoring exercises already being undertaken or planned by the 
Bank Group and other development partners. The PDPG will support regular monitoring of a 
subset of CPS results, and the remainder will be addressed through sector dialogue. 

91.
Progress in achieving expected CPS results will be reviewed mid-stream. A CPSPR 
will be prepared in early FY12 to evaluate the relevance of the strategy outlined in the CPS, 
review progress toward achieving CPS objectives and outcomes, and lay out proposed program 
adjustments over the remainder of the CPS period. In particular, the CPSPR will serve as the 
platform to further define activities for the last two years of the CPS period (FY12-13). 

C. Implementing the CPS 

i. Principles of engagement  

92.
Frontloading. In order to provide a timely and effective response to the ongoing crisis 
and any subsequent economic deterioration that may occur, the Bank Group will frontload some 
IDA resources. This will be achieved by channeling more IDA resources through the PDPG. 

93.
Flexibility. Given uncertainties regarding the duration of the global recession and its 
impact on Tajikistan, the CPS program is designed to be flexible. A specific program is outlined 
only for FY10 and FY11. IDA activities for the remaining CPS period (FY12-13) are indicative 
and will only be laid out in detail following completion of the mid-stream CPSPR. This 
flexibility will enable the CPS to adapt to changing circumstances as the crisis plays out and its 
impact on Tajikistan is measured.  

94.
Selectivity. The CPS will take a selective approach, recognizing the limitations in IDA 
resources and administrative budgets, and the need to intensify supervision of individual 
programs to mitigate fiduciary risks. The Bank Group will focus its advisory services in areas 
that are expected to enhance the effectiveness of its programs and the development impact on its 
client. Selectivity will be achieved by: (i) focusing the bulk of new investments on a few sectors 
(e.g., agriculture, energy, urban water supply, and social services) where it has a long-standing 
engagement and a comparative advantage vis-à-vis other donors; (ii) scaling up only successful 
pilot investment projects through additional financing; and (iii) limiting the number of new IDA 
36 

 
 
investment projects to only one to two projects per year in order to increase the resources 
devoted to program supervision. Where government ownership and reform progress are 
considered weak and uncertain, the Bank Group will withdraw its interventions. In sectors where 
the presence of other donors is significant, the Bank Group will complement their efforts with 
advisory services and global knowledge, and only if necessary.  

95.
Leveraging. The Bank Group will leverage its global knowledge and expertise to attract 
co-financing from traditional and non-traditional development partners. Under the CPS, the Bank 
will also seek to leverage multi-door trust funds to finance investment in global public goods 
(e.g., public participation, climate change and disaster management) while ensuring that these 
activities do not detract from the Bank’s capacity to implement the core IDA program. The JCPS 
recently developed by key development partners in Tajikistan, including the Bank Group will 
also help attract additional financing from donors based on the agreed framework.  

ii. Instruments of support 

96.
The proposed CPS program will maintain a mix between budget support and 
investment activities. Budget support will be programmatic and will serve as an important 
instrument for policy reform and dialogue with the government, in combination with investment 
projects and TA. Investment activities will support government implementation of priority 
reforms. The design of these initiatives will be informed by targeted AAA, which will include 
analysis and TA to assist the government in implementing identified reforms. The Bank and IFC 
can also access various trust funds to extend the reach of AAA and investments, subject to the 
country’s absorptive capacity and Bank staff resources. In addition, IFC will provide direct 
investments to the private sector. 

97.
A new PDPG series is proposed for fiscal years 2010, 2011, and 2012. This 
programmatic operation will focus on addressing the impact of the economic crisis and 
deepening reforms that were initiated under the previous PDPG series. While the specific 
objectives and reform actions are still to be agreed with the government, the PDPG is expected to 
support reforms in several areas critical to Tajikistan’s growth and development: (i) maintaining 
macroeconomic stability; (ii) strengthening the private and financial sectors; (iii) enhancing the 
transparency of energy SOEs; (iv) diversifying agriculture; and (v) improving the social safety 
net. The PDPG may also cover regulatory reform and public service delivery improvements. The 
operation will include only core areas where there is strong government ownership, where 
underlying TA resources can readily be mobilized from the Bank or other development partners, 
and where there is a strong analytical basis for moving forward. The Bank will take the lead in 
coordinating development partners’ budget support under the PDPG. Budget support will be 
disbursed upon confirmation by the IMF that the ECF is on track.

98.
In the short term, the PDPG will provide fiscal space to allow the authorities to 
reduce vulnerabilities. Interventions will be designed and sequenced not only to help the 
government cope with the pressing consequences of the global economic crisis, but also to 
support medium-term reforms to ensure a sustained recovery and continued development of the 
country’s human capital. With additional budget support, the government will be able to protect 
critical expenditures from budget cuts due to revenue shortfalls. To assess the performance of 

37 

 
 
PDPG support, a virtual poverty fund will be created to ring-fence expenditures in pro-poor 
areas. A tracking mechanism will be established to monitor spending and impact in these areas. 
99.
The indicative CPS program for FY10-13 is laid out in Table 4. As mentioned above, 
the strategy relies largely on additional financing for ongoing programs with a proven track 
record, allowing for shortened preparation time and accelerated implementation. Where 
appropriate, ongoing operations have been or will be realigned to conform to the objectives of 
the new CPS. New investment operations will address the impact of the crisis and contribute to 
achievement of the medium-term objectives. To ensure that scarce IDA resources are utilized 
fully and effectively, in case the government undermines macroeconomic stability objective and 
PGPG program is delayed, the CPS will accelerate planned additional financing that will have 
direct impact on the livelihoods of poor people in Tajikistan. In a fragile state such as Tajikistan, 
continued IDA engagement is necessary to help keep the country from falling deeper into crisis. 
Specific CPS activities for FY12-13 will be more specifically laid out following the completion 
of a mid-term CPSPR and after the indicative IDA16 funding envelope is known. Only the FY10 
allocation is firm while estimates for FY11, 12 and 13 are indicative only and can change. Actual 
allocations in these years will depend on: (i) total IDA resources available; (ii) the country’s 
performance rating; (iii) the performance and assistance terms of other IDA borrowers; (iv) the 
terms of IDA's assistance to Tajikistan (grants or credits); and (v) the number of IDA-eligible 
countries. FY12 and FY13 indicative allocation assumes a similar level of replenishment in 
IDA16 as in IDA15. IDA allocations are made in SDRs based on performance, and the US$ 
equivalent is dependent upon the prevailing exchange rate. Finally, the terms of the assistance 
(i.e., grants, credits or a mix of the two) will depend on Tajikistan's debt sustainability position. 
In addition to IDA performance-based allocation, Tajikistan benefits from funding under the 
IDA Crisis Window in the amount of SDR 15.3 million (about US$23.4 million) in FY10. 
100. AAA will focus on “just in time” TA driven by client demand and selected 
analytical work to address knowledge gaps. Table 5 presents AAA planned during the CPS 
period. Macroeconomic monitoring will help the government manage the crisis budget during 
the next few years. A poverty assessment update will analyze the impact of the crisis on poor 
households by geographical location. IDA will also work with the government to develop a 
comprehensive energy sector strategy to ensure that energy investments are prioritized and 
integrated in a holistic approach. An Institutional Governance Review (IGR) is proposed to 
deepen understanding about political economy at the local level. Finally, follow-up activities will 
be undertaken to ensure progress in implementing the recommendations of previously completed 
diagnostic work, such as the CPFR, PEFA, and the Accounting and Auditing Report on the 
Observance of Standards and Codes (A&A ROSC).

iii. IDA-IFC collaboration 

101. Recognizing the critical role of private sector development in ensuring sustainable 
growth and poverty alleviation in Tajikistan, IDA and IFC will continue to collaborate 
closely. The assistance programs of each organization will be coordinated to maximize the Bank 
Group’s overall impact on the expected CPS results. IDA programs will target the Bank’s 
comparative advantage in providing global knowledge and TA to underpin investment operations 
in support of the government’s development agenda. IFC programs will support the private 
sector through advisory services and investments in the business environment, financial sector 
development, and in support of the agriculture and energy sectors. IFC and IDA will continue to 
work closely on fostering private investment; strengthening the soundness and stability of the 
financial sector; improving service reliability, governance, and export potential in the energy 
sector; and improving conditions for a sustainable increase in agricultural productivity.  

iv. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) 

102. MIGA is prepared to support foreign direct investment into Tajikistan through the 
provision of political risk guarantees. However, MIGA’s activity in Tajikistan in FY10-11 will 
be primarily driven by foreign investors’ demand. MIGA will coordinate its potential 
involvement in support of foreign investments into Tajikistan with IDA and IFC.  

40 

 
 
v. WBI program 

103. WBI will continue to support capacity building efforts in the areas of public 
financial management (PFM), procurement, trade, health, climate change, and public-
private partnerships. WBI will focus on facilitating structured learning in partnership with 
regional and local institutions and practitioner networks, emphasizing just-in-time practitioner 
exchanges and South-South learning to address key capacity constraints to achieving 
development results, and focusing on the “how” of reform (practitioner knowledge, leadership 
and multi-stakeholder consensus building). WBI will provide support through the two of its new 
business lines - the Global Partner platform and the Practitioner Exchange platform. WBI will 
also help national institutions to connect globally and to draw on a range of relevant experiences.  
Activities will include upgrading skills, updating curriculum, sharing lessons learned and best 
practices, consensus-building workshops, and long-term TA to strengthen the capacity of key 
government staff. 

vi. Regional cooperation   

104. During the CPS period, the Bank will continue to support a number of regional 
initiatives through the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) program. 
Areas of CAREC support include energy, transport and trade facilitation, and communicable 
disease prevention and disaster management. The Bank Group will work with Tajikistan and 
other Central Asian countries to elaborate a Regional Energy-Water Development Framework 
covering existing and potential energy generation resources in the region, including hydropower, 
coal, thermal energy, and others. This framework would propose a sequence of actions to ensure 
a proper balance between the urgent domestic energy needs of the upstream countries during 
winter, and the environmental and hydrological needs of the downstream countries during 
summer. The proposed framework would also focus on maximizing energy export potential 
within the region during winter and beyond the region during summer. The latter would be 
supported by the establishment of a Central Asia-South Asia Regional Energy Market 
(CASAREM), a set of projects for enabling power trade within and between Central and South 
Asia. In addition, in the context of the elaboration of a Regional Energy-Water Development 
Framework, the Bank Group plans to contribute to the identification of immediate and medium-
term investment priorities in the region for consideration by all Central Asian countries and 
potential investors to maximize gains from regional cooperation. In parallel, the Bank Group will 
review water resource development and water management issues with stakeholders and partners 
in Central Asia with a view to supporting the development of and access to these resources (Box 
3). In transport and trade facilitation, the on-going Bank financed study on the performance of 
selected road transport corridors in Central Asia is now being complemented by a series of 
technical assistance activities (financed by a grant from the Trade Facilitation Facility) in the 
area of transport and logistics. Activities will include (i) logistics chain analysis for specific 
products and transport routes, as well as (ii) policy advice on issues pertinent to the development 
of logistics and transport. 

41 

 
 
 
 
Box 3:  Regional Energy-Water Development Framework 
The WB is working with the governments of the five Central Asian countries to develop a comprehensive, long-
term program to increase regional cooperation, encourage efficient energy resource development, and address water 
management challenges. It is intended that this program will draw on Central Asian regional institutions—including 
the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea (IFAS) and others—to conduct the analysis and coordinate 
stakeholder consultations on key development choices and trade-offs. Work on the Central Asia Energy-Water 
Development Framework (CAEWDF) aims to help Central Asian countries take advantage of their energy and 
water resource base in an environmentally and socially sustainable manner, while respecting national priorities and 
safeguarding regional stability. The Bank has initiated the development of this program in consultation with 
regional governments and international development agencies active in the region. 

The program addresses three main themes: (a) balancing energy options to take advantage of the region’s rich 
diversity in energy resources while addressing winter energy deficits, including new energy investments; (b) 
expanding energy trade within and outside the region by strengthening regional dispatch and investing in 
transmission infrastructure; and (c) working with regional organizations on energy-water linkages by securing 
strong analytical foundations, supporting dialogue among Central Asian countries, and (d) improving water use 
productivity in both the energy and agricultural sectors.  

D. Partnerships and Participation 

105. The Bank Group is developing strong partnerships with key development partners 
in Tajikistan in the context of the JCPS. Two recent studies showed that the delivery of donor 
assistance in Tajikistan has been sub-optimal in the past due to weak donor coordination, limited 
government ownership, misalignment between donor and government programs, and a lack of 
predictability and timeliness in donor funding. In 2007, an initial group of development partners 
led by DFID came together to develop a JCPS with the aim of enhancing aid effectiveness 
through alignment and harmonization, in line with the 2005 Paris Club Declaration and the 2008 
the Accra Agenda for Action. JCPS partners27 decided in early 2009 that the strategy would be 
developed in two phases. The first phase, completed in September 2009, focused on developing a 
joint aid coordination strategy to improve aid effectiveness. The aid coordination strategy defines 
shared principles and a common basis for actions to improve aid effectiveness. The shared 
principles reflect the five underlying principles of the Paris Declaration and Accra Agenda that 
are applicable to circumstances in Tajikistan. These principles will guide the delivery of aid to 
Tajikistan and cooperation between the government and its development partners, both on a 
bilateral basis and in extended multi-donor partnerships (Annex 5). The shared principles will be 
applied through greater use of sector working groups, joint missions, and diagnostic reviews, and 
development of a common arrangement for planning, funding, disbursement, monitoring, 
evaluation, and reporting on development partner activities and aid flows. The overall goal is 
summarized as “One Strategy, One Coordination Mechanism, and One Monitoring and 
Evaluation and Results Framework.” The second phase of donor cooperation efforts will focus 
on identifying specific programs of joint donor assistance to support implementation of the 
government’s PRS III.  

27 The JCPS group has expanded to include: ADB, DFID, EC, Sweden, Switzerland, UN organizations (UNICEF, 
UNDP, and WFP), USAID, and the WB. The Government of Tajikistan is represented by the Chairman of the State 
Committee on Investment and State Property Management (SCISPM).

106. As mentioned above, the CPS has been designed with other development partners’ 
activities in mind (Table 6) and focuses in the sectors where the Bank Group has a long-
standing engagement, a comparative advantage, and/or complementary global knowledge 
and expertise. Taking into account of existing and planned activities of the JCPS partners, the 
Bank Group will continue to focus on agriculture, energy, private sector development, water and 
sanitation, and the social sectors. In agriculture and energy sectors, the Bank Group’s 
involvement will build on existing engagements in response to client demand. In the private and 
financial sectors, Bank Group activities will focus mostly on advisory services and technical 
assistance in coordination with other JCPS partners. Activities in the social sectors will be scaled 
up, as some JCPS partners have withdrawn interventions. In areas where other donors are highly 
active, such as ADB’s strong engagement in the transport sector, the Bank Group’s involvement 
will be limited.  

107. The Bank Group will expand collaboration with new bilateral development 
partners. These partners, including China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Iran, and Saudi Arabia, have 
been increasing their development assistance to Tajikistan, thereby contributing to an overall 
growth in aid flows to the country. These investments, sometimes significant, prompt for better 
coordination and monitoring to ensure an efficient and effective division of labor. Specifically, 
China provided US$281.2 million credit to finance the construction of the road connecting 
Dushanbe and the northern part of Tajikistan. Two loans were contracted for the construction of 
a North-South electricity transmission line (US$267.2 million) and Lolazor-Khatlon electricity 
transmission lines (US$58.1 million). Russia invested US$480 million(cid:3) (cid:76)n hydropower 
(Sangtuda I). Iran invested about US$200 million for construction of hydropower (Sangtuda II). 
Recently, Russia has contributed to Bank-administered trust funds to address the food price crisis 
and regional issues in Central Asia, especially education, migration, and blood safety.

108. The Bank Group has sought to strengthen its engagement with parliament, civil 
society organizations (CSOs), the media, and the private sector. The aim of these efforts has 
been to strengthen implementation effectiveness by involving a broad array of stakeholders with 
a direct interest in the outcome of reforms, as well as to build awareness of the Bank Group’s 
role in Tajikistan. IDA has involved local community groups in rehabilitating rural infrastructure 
in their communities and CSOs in the monitoring of distribution of winter wheat seeds and 
fertilizer to poor households. Implementation of reforms to the business-enabling environment 
has been carried out in consultation with the private sector. The design of the CPS itself has 
benefited from the input of a wide range of development partners (Box 4). 

Box 4:  Consultations on the Tajikistan CPS 
In preparing the Tajikistan CPS, the Bank Group country team conducted a series of consultations with key 
stakeholders in central and local government, parliament, the private sector, civil society organizations and the 
media. Consultations were held during September 8-17, 2009, in the capital, Dushanbe, as well as in Kurgan 
Tyube, Khujand, and Khorog. Due to postponement of the CPS Board date from November 2009 to May 25, 
2010, the second round of consultations was held with the government on December 2009 and February 2010 
(on the Bank’s involvement in hydropower development and the use of IDA crisis window) and with CSOs on 
March 31, 2010 (on the revised CPS). 
Overall, consulted groups expressed strong support for the CPS objectives, and the proposed program and 
instruments. Government appreciated the emphasis on short-term initiatives to reduce the impact of the crisis 
and endorsed the proposed program and instruments, especially during the first two years. Government 
stakeholders also agreed on the proposed prioritization of agriculture, energy, private and financial sectors, 
and social sectors over the medium term. Development partners agreed with the overall strategy and its 
approach to governance and stressed the need to continue strengthening donor cooperation in the context of 
the JCPS. Parliament called for improved collaboration even at the project level. Stakeholders in civil society 
and the media expressed a preference for stronger transparency and accountability in the implementation of 
Bank-financed projects and closer involvement of non-governmental organizations in implementation, 
monitoring and evaluation through greater dissemination of information on WB activities in Tajikistan using 
various communication channels. They raised concerns about the development of Rogun hydropower and 
requested the Bank to work close with the government to ensure transparency of government operations and to 
improve investment climate, and be (Annex 2).  

V. MANAGING RISKS 

109. Macroeconomic. Implementation of the CPS could be delayed by a slow recovery in 
Russia and other developed countries as well as not meeting the requirements under the 
IMF ECF. Under this scenario, external demand for Tajikistan’s exports and migrant workers 
would continue to weaken and further delay economic recovery. Macroeconomic stability would 
be jeopardized if the government were to adopt an inappropriate policy framework to deal with a 
deteriorating situation. According to the IMF latest assessment, continued sale of the Rogun 
shares would undermine macroeconomic stability through reducing disposable incomes and 
liquidity access, and increase quasi-fiscal deficit associated with SOEs’ subscription of the 
Rogun’s equity shares.  The Bank Group’s program, especially budget support under the PDPG, 
could be brought into question.  

Response: The Bank Group will work closely with the IMF in the context of the ECF 
program to help maintain macroeconomic stability. In addition, the Bank will closely 

45 

 
 
monitor macroeconomic developments and budget implementation in collaboration with 
the government. In case of unsatisfactory performance under the ECF program, the Bank 
Group will scale up investment projects aimed at reducing vulnerabilities in the social 
sector.  

110. Delayed Reform. Weak government commitment to deeper reforms in productive 
sectors could delay reforms envisaged under the CPS program. As the impact of the crisis 
diminishes, the desire to implement difficult reforms may lessen in the face of strong resistance 
from vested interests. This would slow much needed progress in expanding productive capacity 
of agriculture, energy, and the private and financial sectors.  

Response: The CPS has identified several steps to reduce the risk of delayed reform. 
First, CGAC implementation will help highlight governance constraints in key sectors 
and identify measures to address these constraints within Bank Group operations. 
Second, the new PDPG series could include, as prior actions for obtaining budget 
support, policy initiatives to reduce constraints to growth and poverty reduction. Under 
the previous PDPG operation, delivered in 2009, inclusion of such prior actions 
succeeded in accelerating policy reforms in agriculture and energy. Third, the Bank 
Group will collaborate closely with JCPS partners to encourage the government to renew 
its reform commitment. Finally, the CPS will concentrate on additional financing of 
ongoing investment operations that have demonstrated a strong track record of 
government commitment and development results.  

111.
Institutional capacity. Weak capacity and high turnover of key civil servants could 
slow CPS implementation. Institutional deficiencies, unless addressed, could significantly 
constrain the ability to formulate, implement and monitor the government’s program at the 
national level. Such constraints would hamper the effectiveness of public service delivery, 
especially social services that are vital for achievement of the MDGs. Weak capacity at the 
project level could delay implementation of investments and exacerbate fiduciary risks, thus 
hindering the achievement of expected CPS results.  

Response: The CPS will emphasize follow-on investments in areas where prior 
operations have yielded tangible results, building on capacity improvements that are 
already underway. The Governance Checklist outlined in the CGAC strategy (Annex 4) 
will be applied at the project design stage and again during mid-stream reviews in order 
to ensure that individual projects address institutional capacity requirements and 
individual technical capacity needs, and that sufficient funding is allocated for this 
purpose. 

112. Geo-political. The deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan 
could result in an influx of refugees to Tajikistan. A surge of Afghan refugees would place a 
heavy economic burden on Tajikistan and pose significant social problems, particularly in the 
context of a global economic crisis. A security crisis on its periphery could lead the government 
to divert attention away from its development agenda and reallocate resources at the expense of 
its own population, a situation that could quickly lead to tensions within its own borders.  

46 

 
 
Response: This risk can be mitigated by closely monitoring inter-regional developments, 
and adjusting the CPS implementation to these developments given the flexibility of CPS 
instruments proposed. In addition, the Bank will continue working closely with 
development partners in building donor and government’s capacity in risk management, 
including the risks associated with disaster and emergency.

Annex 2:  Country Partnership Strategy
(FY05-FY09) Completion Report 

I.

INTRODUCTION

1.
The Completion Report for the Tajikistan Country Partnership Strategy (FY05-FY09) is 
drawn from inputs from the country team, available projects and AAAs. The Report is organized 
into five sections. Following the introduction, the second section recounts the challenges the 
country faced in 2004 and the strategies put in place to address them, including the CPS. The 
third section reviews the evolution of key development outcomes and results expected from the 
CPS program, identifying gaps between results attained and results expected. The fourth section 
examines the performance of the Bank based on the CPR conducted in October 2008 undertaken 
jointly with the ADB. The last section puts forth recommendations for the preparation of the next 
Country Partnership Strategy for FY10-FY13.  

2.
The rapid economic growth during the 2005-2008 CPS period contributed to poverty 
alleviation and, aided by increasing public expenditure, reversed a negative trend in social 
indicators. The global crisis, however, exposed the frailty of this growth, which had been driven 
by remittances and favorable international commodity prices. A number of governance missteps 
(among the most prominent was the mismanagement of the National Bank of Tajikistan under 
the purported intent to finance cotton) brought into question the quality of national economic 
stewardship and strained relations with the donor community.  

3.
The ambitious CPS program, which had sought an across-the-board transformation of the 
economy, produced mixed and uneven results. Progress was made when programs targeted well-
defined outcomes and factored in capacity constraints through intensive AAA, well-designed 
programs, and allow for time and dedication for policy dialogue and technical assistance 
(examples of which include the liberalization of aviation and work in health and education). The 
government placed high priority on exploiting the country’s energy potential and the electrical 
interconnection of the region. Efforts to transform agriculture, however, were inadequate (reform 
of the cotton sector, land restructuring and secured land use rights, irrigation), as have attempts 
to modernize the state.  

4.
A key lesson from this CPS Completion Report (CPSCR) is that an ambitious reform 
agenda in the context of a weak institutional environment can easily overburden the authorities. 
The result was dispersed and incomplete results that jeopardized the credibility of the initiatives. 
Therefore, this review calls for greater realism in program design and adherence to strict 
prioritization.  This approach should assure a more timely delivery of coordinated results, and the 
benefit of generating a virtuous cycle of reform. The Bank showed flexibility in delivering the 
program during periods of unforeseen challenges (energy and food crises). It also maintained 
delivery of the core program, especially the Programmatic Development Policy Operation 
(PDPO) and AAAs. The CPS also delivered the expected level of financial support. Coordination 
with other development partners improved.

II.

CHALLENGES AND STRATEGY 

A. Background

5.
Tajikistan became independent in 1991. Internal conflict, however, delayed its transition 
to a market economy. After the civil war ended in 1997, the government under President 
Rahmon worked to establish state authority, concentrating on political consolidation and security 
and rehabilitating and developing the war-torn country. Three years later, although much had 
been accomplished, the economy was fragile with a per capita income of only US$310 for its 6.7 
million inhabitants.  

6.
Between 2000 and 2004 the economy grew by almost 60 percent, driven by an expansion 
of services and construction fuelled by remittances and favorable world prices for country’s main 
export commodities—aluminum and cotton. Good macroeconomic management helped bring 
inflation down to 7 percent in 2004, stabilized the exchange rate, and reduced the debt burden by 
restraining new borrowing and by restructuring agreements with bilateral creditors. External debt 
to GDP dropped from 85 percent in 2002 to 40 percent at end-2004. Gross international reserves 
increased to US$189 million at end-2004. Economic growth reduced the poverty rate from 81 
percent in 1999 to 64 percent in 2003, (although regional differences remained significant, 
ranging from 84 percent in Gorno-Badakhshan to 45 percent in Rayons of Republican 
Subordinated, RRS).  

B. Challenges (2004)

7.

The 2005 CPS identified three sets of challenges, which remain valid today.  

8.
Daunting geography complicated by man-made barriers.  The nearest port is found 2,000 
kilometers away and high mountains separate Tajikistan from Kyrgyz Republic and China. In 
addition, man-made restrictions limit access to Uzbekistan and the long-border with Afghanistan 
raises security and drug trafficking concerns. Constraints to aviation further isolated the country.  

9.
Major governance challenges due to a complex political economy. The government, 
which had achieved the necessary political consolidation to establish security throughout the 
country through a complex web of political agreements after the war, faced significant 
governance challenges. The authorities confronted difficulties in transitioning towards a modern 
government grounded on transparency and accountability. Governance challenges were 
particularly troubling in the aluminum and cotton sectors. The opportunities and incentives for 
corruption were high in a public administration with the structure and procedures inherited from 
the Soviet system, beset by low public sector wages (around US$10 a month on average) and a 
lack of accountability.     

10.
Demography challenge. A rapidly growing population was exerting severe pressure on 
service delivery, and, as a result, trends in school enrollment, child mortality, maternal mortality, 
and HIV/AIDS prevalence appeared to be moving in the wrong direction.  The challenge was 
how to stem the decline in these indicators while retaining and expanding the human capital 
inherited from the Soviet system.   

58 

 
 
C. Government Strategy 

11.
The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP-2002-2005) articulated the government’s 
view of development and poverty reduction around four primary objectives:    

To encourage equitable, labor-intensive economic growth, with an emphasis on exports. 
To support the efficient and fair provision of basic social services. 
To target support to the poorest groups of the population. 
To improve governance and security. 

12.
First, the government prioritized state-building efforts around public sector reform—to 
improve administrative effectiveness and reduce corruption—and address critical governance 
challenges in the management of state enterprises and cotton sector reform. Second, the 
government foresaw a greater role for the private sector through continued privatization and a 
lower regulatory burden on business. On rural development, the government envisioned sorting 
out the cotton debt, continuing the farm land privatization program, improving competition in 
farm inputs and cotton marketing, and rehabilitating irrigation infrastructure. Third, the 
government placed a high priority on developing the country’s hydropower infrastructure for 
electricity and aluminum exports as a strategic answer to Tajikistan’s geographical isolation. 
Finally, the priority on health and education was to halt the deterioration of public service 
delivery and to subsequently recover and come as close as possible to the MDG targets.  

D. Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 

13.
The Bank and the authorities met in Warsaw to agree on the key priorities of support. The 
dialogue emphasized selectivity (given the limited IDA resources) and maintaining the growth 
trend, while preparing the country for sustained growth over the longer term. The partners 
identified three strategic objectives for the CPS: (a) improve business opportunities in rural and 
urban areas; (b) preserve and enhance the quality of health and education; and (c) improve the 
delivery of energy services and exploit the country’s hydropower potential. IFC participated 
actively at the Warsaw discussions and in the preparation of the CPS and took leadership of 
improving the business environment and facilitating access to credit.  

14.
Efforts to improve national governance and reduce corruption through strengthening of 
the state’s institutional capacity were designed to support the three pillars. The CPS relied on an 
on-going program covering most of the result agenda. In addition, it introduced a DPO series of 
three operations to lead the policy dialogue with the authorities and help finance the budget. The 
CPS design was relevant to the government priorities and addressed the challenges facing the 
country. However, its scope was ambitious in light of the limited capacity of the government to 
implement the program and the limited IDA resources.  

E. Risks 

15.
The strategy document pointed to external risks related to potential spillovers from a 
tense regional situation in Afghanistan, the volatile Fergana Valley, and the drug trade. In 
addition, the CPS identified two likely sources of external economic shocks: (a) a decline in 
remittances from Russia, and (b) a fall in the world prices for aluminum or cotton. Lastly, the 

59 

 
 
 
CPS was concerned that IDA and other donors may not be able to generate a level of support 
sufficient to fund even a narrow set of development challenges given that other development 
partners allocated resources based on the country’s performance.   

16.
As major internal risks, the CPS saw the limited implementation capacity and weak 
governance, and the likely complacency in the face of an improving external environment. Given 
Tajikistan's fragile economic and social setting, the CPS noted that any slackening of the reform 
effort, related to governance (state owned enterprise accountability, cotton, and energy sectors), 
would risk recent gains and would make the CPS goals unattainable. Lastly, the CPS alluded to 
potential instability arising from a growing and youthful population.  

III.

ANALYSIS OF RESULTS 

17.
The analysis of results begins with a brief overview of the broad national development 
outcomes relevant to the CPS program. Subsequently, it provides a detailed discussion of the 
CPS program with emphasis on results from the program and, as possible, its contribution to 
development outcomes.  

A. Development Outcomes 

18.
The level of poverty has decreased but remains high, especially in rural areas. 
Preliminary findings from the 2007 Tajikistan Livings Standards Survey (TLSS) indicate that 
economic growth and remittances improved the livings standards of the Tajik population since 
2003, when the rate of poverty incidence stood at 64 percent. The same survey shows that 
remittances accounted for around 17 percent of the disposable household income on average and 
contributed to poverty reduction more than social transfers, which account for only 2 percent of 
disposable income. Still, by the end of 2007, 41 percent of the population was poor and 17 
percent was extremely poor.28 In addition, considerable income volatility in rural areas, where 72 
percent of the poor live, exposes its population to periodic deeper drops in consumption. About 
50 percent of the poor are working poor, meaning that labor market participation does not reduce 
the risk of falling into poverty.  

19.
The economy grew rapidly. From 2004 to 2008 the economy grew on average at an 
annual rate of 8 percent. Remittances and increasing public expenditure drove demand. Supply 
was relatively elastic, given that private investment remained low (around 7 percent of GDP 
which is scarcely above 5.1 percent in 2003.) Increases in the domestic supply of goods relied for 
the most part on existing capacity. Public investment as a share of GDP (increasing from 8.1 
percent in 2004 to 14.1 percent in 2007) was driven by electricity investments.  In 2009, with the 
backdrop of the global recession, fears of an economic slowdown have materialized.  

20.
Availability of resources to the public sector increased considerably. The resources 
available to the government to finance its expenditures increased on account of (a) the rapid rate 
of growth of GDP; (b) the increase in the ratio of domestic revenue to GDP from 17.3 percent  in 
2004 to 20.5 percent  in 2007; and (c) external assistance. Public expenditure jumped from 20.3 

28 The 2007 WB poverty estimate applies the 2003-2007 rate of per-capita income growth to the 2003 household 
survey data.  

60 

 
 
                                                 
percent in 2004 to 27.6 percent of GDP in 2007. The government increased (a) financing of 
social sectors, (b) wages and salaries of public officials, and (c) public investment.  

21.
But the macroeconomic environment has deteriorated since 2007. Inflation was 
exacerbated—the rate of inflation rose from 5.1 percent in 2004 to 19.8 in 2007. Concurrently, 
the external position of the economy deteriorated as the current account deficit moved up from 4 
percent in 2004 to 9.5 percent of GDP in 2007 and unencumbered foreign exchange reserves fell 
to slightly above US$100 million at the end of 2007. The domestic cotton debt problem, the 
international financial crisis, and the declining liquidity of commercial banks have weakened the 
stability of the financial sector. The frail position of the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT) has 
reduced the scope for monetary policy.  

22.
The perception of the quality of governance has worsened. Tajikistan’s CPIA in 2008 
remained the same as that of 2004 (3.2, at the bottom of the IDA ECA scale). Governance proper 
within the CPIA (property rights, public expenditure management, public administration, 
transparency and revenue) remained static at 2.6. Only social sectors showed an improvement 
from 3.0 (2004) to 3.4 in (2008). While governance might not have deteriorated during the 
period, the cracks became more evident and are affecting the credibility of the state. The 
developments at the Central Bank concerning the non-transparent provision of guarantees and 
loans to KreditInvest and cotton investors and the lack of proper accounting and the absence of 
internal controls at the NBT are clear example of the governance shortcomings. These concerns 
extend to other areas such as the management of public funds, and the handling of large public 
enterprises, where improvements in governance have also been hard to come by.   

23.
Tajikistan faces the emerging crisis from a very weak position. Despite the rapid rate of 
economic growth and rising public revenues, structural reforms in key strategic sectors have 
been slowly implemented. Today, the government is in a weak position to face the current crisis: 
remittances have dropped, prices for cotton and aluminum products are lower, and it faces a 
substantive loss in credibility resulting from the mismanagement of the cotton farm debt.     

B. Results from CPS Interventions 

Pillar I: Foster broad based growth in urban and rural areas 

24.
Under this pillar, the CPS supported actions to remove institutional barriers to economic 
growth. The strategy envisaged the development of a highly competitive investment climate as 
the compensating factor for the extreme isolation of the country. In addition, the strategy 
emphasized the development of agriculture, as the majority of the population, in particular the 
poor, live in rural areas. The pillar defined two sets of results clusters around:  

(cid:120)
(cid:120)

Improving the business climate and access to finance 
Improving the competitiveness of agriculture. 

25.
To help achieve the objectives, the World Bank Group drew on a wide range of 
instruments; most notably the three operations under the Programmatic Development Policy 
Grant (PDPG), several operations in support of agricultural reform, IFC through technical 
assistance, availability of credit lines to finance small and medium enterprises and a series of 
analytical notes in support of the policy dialogue. The following paragraphs take stock of the 
61 

 
 
results achieved. A key lesson that emerges is that in a weak institutional environment major 
efforts are needed to set the basis for progress and that initial change can be slow.  

Marginal progress in improving the business climate and access to finance

Results expected  by the CPS 
Improved business environment by 
reducing costs and time imposed by 
government regulation on businesses as 
measured by surveys (IFC SME survey)  

Created conditions for better access to 
financing by SMEs through the Tajik Micro 
& Small Enterprise and Regional Leasing 
facilities 

Increased the share of the private sector 
(from 50% in 2004) including through 
completing the 2004-2007 Privatization Plan 
for Medium and Large Enterprises 

Results Achieved 
Implementation of Inspections 
and Tax Administration 
reforms yielded savings to 
businesses of US$11.2 million 
[IFC].   
Tajikistan leasing portfolio 
across all financial institutions 
grew 860% from 2006 to 2008, 
reaching US$21.7 million. 
(IFC support)  

Private sector share in the 
economy had increased.  (See 
CPS Progress Report) 

Other Achievements 
In July 2006, the law on Inspections was 
adopted; successive regulations have 
followed. Amendments to licensing law 
approved in July 2006 reduced the 
number of activities to 65.  
IFC has provided about US$21 million of 
its funds in 8 projects in the financial 
sector. IFC extended US$2.5 million for 
trade finance and US$5.5 million for 
micro finance.  In addition, IFC 
Corporate Governance Project is helping 
improve institutional capacity in banks; 
Some 500 medium and large enterprises 
were privatized through a process most 
observers deem as transparent.  

Supporting Program: PDPG I, II and III, Private Sector Development Note; Aviation Policy Note; Banking TA. IFC TA, IFC Corporate 
Governance Project; IFC direct lending; and IFC lending through regional instruments.   

26.
IDA has led the dialogue to improve governance and competition in aviation through the 
PDPG series. A new institutional architecture for the aviation sector has separated policy making 
from technical regulation and from operations. The government adopted a resolution to 
restructure Tajik State Airlines by end 2008, leading to separation of airlines, airports, and air 
tariff control. These reforms have improved access and safety and the expectation is that they 
will lower costs as well. This hard-won progress illustrates how time and effort can pay off in 
building capacity and institutions.  

27.
IFC and IDA have supported simplification of business inspections and licensing. PDPG 
dialogue and IFC support have helped achieve significant results in both inspections and taxation 
reform. To implement the 2006 Law on inspections, the IFC supported amendments to more than 
20 laws, regulations, and instructions to comply with the Law. In 2008, the IFC assisted in the 
adoption and implementation of a simplified tax reporting system for individual entrepreneurs. In 
addition, WBG support was behind the adoption of the July 2006 law “On Inspections” and 
legislative and regulatory changes needed for its implementation. Reportedly the number of 
activities subject to licensing has been reduced from 1,500 to about 113; new rules and 
procedures have been established to reduce arbitrariness.  

28.
Access to financial services has improved, but the gains are at risk. By June 2008 credit 
to the private sector was estimated at 20.7 percent, compared to 14.4 percent of GDP in 2005. 
Banking assets have increased rapidly from 11 percent of GDP in 2005 to 25.3 percent at the end 
of 2007. Microfinance institutions have grown in number and types and now serve 50,000 
clients. Lending by micro-credit organizations grew by 200 percent in 2006 and a further 80 
percent in the first half of 2007, but the sector remains small with a portfolio of US$37 million. 
Still, high interest rates, lack of long-term sources of funding, a weak secure lending framework, 
and accounting and auditing shortcomings remain formidable barriers to improved access to 
62 

 
 
 
 
finance. Not surprisingly, the 2010 Doing Business places “Getting Credit” in Tajikistan 167 
among 183 economies. Recently, the financial sector is coming under stress from the forced 
lending from the government to commercial banks to on-lend to the cotton sector, now up to 19 
percent of the banking sector capital (April 2009.) The likely effects of the global crisis on the 
banking sector represent an additional risk factor, even if the banking system appears well 
capitalized and non-performing loans are at 7.9 percent in June 2009. The gains of the last four 
years are at risk.

IFC actively supported financial sector development. During FY05-09, IFC committed a 
total of US$23.0 million in 8 projects in Tajikistan’s financial sector. Of this amount, US$6.3 
million was provided to First Microfinance Bank of Tajikistan (FMBT) support their 
microfinance IFC also provided a $2.5 million trade finance line to Eskhata Bank (under the 
Global Trade Finance Facility). To increase microfinance lending, IFC provided US$3 million to 
FMBT and to IMON to support their microfinance lending operations. In addition, IFC provided 
a US$2.5 million trade finance line to Eskhata Bank (under the Global Trade Finance Facility). 
IFC also invested US$10 million in Aureos Central Asia fund, which will invest in SMEs in the 
region. In addition, IFC’s role in the development and growth of financial services in Tajikistan 
includes specific advisory services to financial institutions on agricultural financing, and the 
leasing market. Its portfolio across all financial institutions grew by 860 percent during 2006- 
2008, reaching US$21.7 million. IFC South Tajikistan Cotton Lending Project’s partner financial 
institutions saw their cotton portfolio reaching 95 percent repayment, much higher than the 
national cotton portfolio repayment rate. The support of the IFC Central Asia Mortgage Market 
Development Project helped draft the Mortgage Law of the Republic of Tajikistan (2008), which 
allows banks to start mortgage operations; IFC is providing TA to develop the needed skills. The 
IFC Corporate Governance Project has increased knowledge and training capacity on Corporate 
Governance, along with consultations on Board structures and requirements to companies in both 
the financial and real sectors.   

30.
The available evidence shows a mixed picture in the quality of the business climate, with 
some successes. IFC SME Survey results reveal improvements in the prevalence of some 
administrative procedures from 2005 to 2007. Fewer SMEs were inspected in 2007 than in 2005, 
reflecting good implementation efforts of the 2006 Inspections Law. The 2006 Inspections Law 
and its implementation resulted in annual savings to the Tajik SME sector of $9.3 million in 
direct and indirect costs. The percentage of SMEs that report obtaining a permit also dropped 
significantly, particularly for dekhan farms. The government undertook comprehensive reform of 

63 

 
 
the licensing regime with the 2004 Licensing Law, and fewer small and medium companies and 
dekhan farms report obtaining a license in 2007 than in 2005. 

31.
Challenges remain to implement and expand business environment reforms. 2010 Doing 
Business, IFC SME Survey, and 2008 BEEPS continue to report many impediments to doing 
business in the country. The 2010 Doing Business ranks Tajikistan 152 among 183 countries (an 
improvement from 2009 when it was 164). The ranking of some categories improved, for 
example protecting investors ranked 73 and enforcing contracts ranked high at 39. Starting a 
business ranked 143 and registering a property ranked 78. Overall, entry (creating companies) 
and obtaining construction permits appears to be difficult. Such barriers can easily negate efforts 
that have been made to increase competition through amendments to the competition law and to 
the law of natural monopolies. Operating a business is difficult as underscored by the rankings:
(a) taxation (162), (b) trading across borders (179), (c) getting credit (167), and (d) employing 
workers (143.). The IFC SME Survey shows that certification procedures for products and 
services are more prevalent; the main administrative procedure requirements for SMEs in 
Tajikistan impose direct costs of approximately $18 million per year.

32.
Information from the 2008 BEEPS survey confirms that most firms in Tajikistan 
continued to face hurdles in all fronts. These findings should concern the Bank, IFC and other 
donors that have been working hard on areas such as business licensing and permits, business 
inspections, access to credit, competition, and electricity. 

33.
A strategy is in place to foster private sector development, the present crisis provides the 
opportunity to speed up implementation and increase the supply response of the economy. At the 
request of the government, IDA in close collaboration with IFC and other donors developed a 
Private Sector Development (PSD) Strategy in March 2007. Implementation of the strategy 
started slowly but the pace has picked up in 2009. The renewed effort is welcome given the 
limited participation of the private sector in the economy-- around 55 percent29--despite the 
implementation of the 2004-2007 Privatization Plan which transferred around 500 medium and 
large enterprises to the private sector. In the present environment, the chances for further 
privatization are low. Emphasis should be on fostering the entry of new enterprises and the 
growth of existing firms.  

Reform and performance in agriculture continue to lag.

34.
Bank support for agriculture has been guided by the dual objectives of assisting the 
government (a) develop policies for sustainable agriculture growth; and (b) resolve the cotton 
crisis. The CPS targeted results in the agriculture sector was highly relevant because the majority 
of the population and the poor live in the agriculture sector that underperformed the rest of the 
economy since 2003 and because cotton utilizes around three-fourth of irrigated land. Various 
factors have constrained the cotton sector growth including slow progress in issuing land use 
certificates, weak price incentives for cotton farmers from a group of non-competitive and 
closely held ginneries, continued state management of production targets,30 and difficult access

were further crippling the sector.

Project.  

35.
Bank AAA supported preparation of an Agriculture Sector Strategy in 2007. This strategy 
identified land titling and resolution of the cotton crisis as priorities. The strategy gave way to a 
Roadmap, which the government adopted in 2007 through a Presidential Decree 111 and later 
decree 313 in 2008. However, progress in reform was minimal, thus, affecting the 
implementation of the Bank’s assistance program and the delivery of expected results. On May 
30, 2009, the government announced a Presidential decree related to cotton debt resolution and 
in July 2009 approved an action plan to write off cotton debt owed by farmers to ginners and 
commercial banks.  

36.
The objective of a more competitive cotton market has not been met, but partial gains 
have been made.  The Bank has pursued a dialogue on cotton grading standard and export 
licensing through the PDPG series and the Cotton Sector Recovery Project.31 Recent 
achievements include deregulating the grading of cotton and lifting licensing of cotton exports 
by the NBT in late 2008, so the barriers in the cotton sector were in place during most of the CPS 
period. Most importantly, the production target for cotton farming remained mandatory 
throughout this period. However, the authorities have reduced the area under mandatory 
cultivation by 50,000 hectares (around 25 percent of the total area) for the on-going season. 
Forcing cotton production has weakened reform efforts. For instance, opening to competition in 
ginning with the idea of bringing in foreign investment has not delivered expected results as 
potential investors are driven away by the present uncertainties. Implementation of the Cotton 
Sector Recovery Project has been slow and has been restructured.  

for freedom to farm without Government interference. However, slow implementation means that even non-cotton 
farms must report on the acreage used for each crop, herd numbers, etc.  In the Dairy sector, government control has 
lead to low levels of production of fodder crops, reduced fodder available for milk cows, and therefore lower 
production of milk.   
31 The Cotton Sector Recovery Project was effective September 2007.  

65 

 
 
 
                                                                                                                                                             
37.
Financing cotton has given rise to several governance failures. The Cotton Sector 
Recovery Project sought to address the cotton debt and proposed a mechanism to do so. This 
came to naught, and unbeknownst to the public; the NBT extended loans to and guaranteed 
foreign borrowing by private investors under the assumption that they would finance farmers. As 
investors defaulted on their obligations the NBT took on their debt, affecting its capital and net 
reserve position. The recent audit of the NBT (March, 2009) pointed to a number of deficiencies 
and questioned the involvement of the NBT in cotton financing. While this involvement stopped 
as of 2008, the Ministry of Finance lends funds to commercial banks to on-lend to cotton farmers 
(in 2008) and for the agricultural sector (2009), thereby  engendering a problem for the banks or 
further fiscal costs.    

38.
Titling of the land is behind schedule due to lack of political will especially in cotton 
areas. Efforts to advance land titling through the Land Registration and Cadastre System for 
Sustainable Agriculture Project have fallen short of expectations and only 509 land certificates 
had been issued as of the September 2008 midterm review. Recently, there has been some 
acceleration and as of end April 2009 a cumulative total of 2,488 certificates had been issued. 
The mid-term review of the project suggested lowering the final target to 37,500 certificates 
rather than 75,000 as in the original project document and to focus attention on removing 
institutional barriers to the introduction of a land-property system. The multi-donor dialogue is 
helping improve the legal framework as the Land Code limits the government’s discretion to 
revoke land rights without fair compensation and due process was amended in early 2008. In 
addition, a new law has been approved for the creation of a unified registration system. Overall, 
while progress towards a modern legal framework for land has been incomplete and at times 
contradictory, it has nevertheless taken important steps forward with CPS support.  

39.
The tardiness in titling is delaying improvements in irrigation. Bank support for building 
irrigation institutions came through a pilot supported by the Fergana Valley Project. Lack of 
proper titling slowed down implementation, specifically the creation of water user associations. 
The already established water user associations in the pilot areas worked with local governments 
to issue land titles so that irrigation infrastructure could be rehabilitated. This fact reinforced the 
findings of IEG’s Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for the Farm Privatization 
Support Project (FPSP) that efforts at improving and manage infrastructure are less sustainable 
in the absence of clear property rights.32  It downgraded the outcome’s rating of the FPSP from 
satisfactory to moderately satisfactory. In addition, IEG’s review of the Rural Infrastructure 
Rehabilitation Project downgraded the project outcomes from moderately unsatisfactory to 
unsatisfactory, showing the difficulties in improving infrastructure in an institutional weak 
environment. Lastly, the fact that agriculture is performing better outside of cotton areas, 
suggesting that farmers respond to market incentives.  

40.
IFC is the only IFI that has remained substantially engaged at a grassroots level in the 
cotton sector. The Farmers Ownership Model that forms, trains and empowers farmer-owned 

32 The FPSP, concluded in 2004, help privatize 10 collective farms, rehabilitate infrastructure and create nine user 
associations have assumed water distribution to members collecting fees for their services. Also it helped issue 6000 
titles. An IEG PPAR for the FPSP noted that while the repair needs for irrigation had been carefully assessed under 
the project, in the absence of cropping freedom, access to free markets , etc. the farms were unlikely to maintained-
repaired systems.

finance cooperatives has produced results on the ground. SugdAgroServe (SAS), the recipient of 
IFC support, currently has more than 1,080 member shareholders (from 400 shareholders at the 
beginning) and a loan portfolio of over US$1.15 million that finances a variety of crops and 
livestock. Through its retail business, SAS provides high quality fertilizers, crop protection 
products, seeds and machinery. The marketing division ensures that farmers receive the best 
possible price for their crops. SAS is now operating independently without IFC Advisory 
Services support. This experience allowed IFC to launch the South Tajikistan Cotton Lending 
Project that partners with banks to introduce commercially viable loan products tailored to 
financing cotton production (average loan size is $20,000). The project now works with two IFC 
investment client banks that have expanded their lending portfolio to small and medium sized 
cotton farmers from almost zero to $2.7 million over 2 years. Through both the South Tajikistan 
Cotton Lending Project and IFC support for SAS, IFC approved more than $7 million in loans 
for the cotton sector, covering nearly 6,500 hectares. 

41.
In addition, the Agribusiness Supply Chain project that began implementation from 2007 
has provided more than 300 hours of consultations to 100 farms and 20 organizations. The 
results are tangible: demonstrated increases of at least 8 percent in milk production at the larger 
dairy farms. Outreach on farmers’ rights has also been successful with farms taking independent 
decisions to expand fodder crops by 5-10 percent. The project has been very successful at the 
farmer level but has encountered challenges in establishing a strong anchor client around which 
to build a supply chain.  

First pillar contribution to long-term outcomes  

42.
The Bank program under this pillar was to help the country prepare for the long-term by 
removing critical barriers to private sector economy activity. By this account the impact of the 
program has been subdued, although there is a fair amount of work in progress. The salient 
outcome is the reform of the aviation sector that is already having an impact. Towards the end of 
the CPS the government introduced some reforms on cotton—lifting the exporting licenses and 
reforming the cotton grading process. However, there is evidence that mandatory cotton farming 
is still in place, even if the area under cultivation is going down. The financing of cotton gave 
rise to considerable governance missteps that have damaged the credibility of the nation, and that 
will require fiscal resources to capitalize the NBT. Even today, financing cotton from the budget 
through the banking system carries both fiscal and financial risks given the relatively low rate of 
repayment of loan obligations. Now that the legal background is in place, land titling could take 
off during the next strategy (assuming adequate government commitment), setting a basis for 
rapid improvement in irrigation and increased investment in rural areas. During this CPS, land 
titling and irrigation recovery has fallen below expectations. The work of IFC and IDA in search 
of a better business environment is on-going, contributing to the modernization of the framework 
for permits, tax administration, licensing and inspections. Intensive work to develop and 
implement the Inspections Law by IFC has led to the development of inspection checklists, 
enabling regulations in inspectorates, and training for all inspectors in the two pilot inspectorates. 
The focus on implementation has yielded results in decreasing the coverage of inspections, 
number of inspections, and duration of inspections, yielding cost savings for the private sector of 
US$9.3 million. Tax administration has been identified by SMEs as a constraint in IFC SME 
Surveys. In 2008, IFC implemented a simplified taxation regime for individual entrepreneurs 
(patent) which has also yielded cost savings of US$2 million to SMEs. However, the low level of 

67 

 
 
private investment raises questions about the pace and scope of deregulation, and whether the 
on-going pace suits an increasingly difficult external environment. Analytical work should 
inform rapid and coherent actions to trigger a fast supply response in this time of crisis.   

Pillar II: Preserve and enhance the quality of health and education 

43.
Under this pillar the CPS supported government efforts to reverse the negative trends in 
health and education induced by the lack of financing and deteriorating delivery systems. The 
government program committed to turn the situation around by increasing budgetary allocations 
to the health and education sectors (which had gone down respectively to 0.9 and 2.7 percent of 
GDP in 2004), and modernize institutions to increase coverage and efficiency. The aim was to 
improve the likelihood of delivering on the Millennium Development Goals. The CPS results can 
be grouped in two results packages:  
Improving the health of the population 
Improving education  for the population

Supporting program: Community and Basic Health Project (CBHP), sector investment grant co-financed by SIDA, and regional operation on 
HIV/AIDS, 2007 Tajikistan Living Standards Survey (TLSS).  

 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
44.
The Bank program supporting health was relevant, but the lack of a comprehensive 
strategy complicated implementation.  The Bank instruments have been a Community and Basic 
Health Project (CBHP), and a sector investment grant co-financed by SIDA. In addition, a 
regional operation financed work on HIV/AIDS. The Bank project supported development and 
pilot implementation of (a) primary health system financed with capitation grants, and (b) a basic 
benefits package. The pilot approach took account of the capacity limitations in the country. 
Regretfully, during implementation lack of a comprehensive health strategy created duplication 
and fragmentation from piecemeal intervention of players in multiple PIUs. The government and 
development partners are now working towards a comprehensive strategy.   

45.
The poor have better access to health services in the regions of Bank support.  The 
preliminary results from the 2007 Tajikistan Living Standards Survey (TLSS) report 
improvements in the access to health services by the poor. For Sogd and Khatlon oblasts (where 
the seven rayons the Bank project is working with are located), the percentage of the households 
that do not seek access to health services because they cannot afford them dropped to 29 and 37 
percent respectively from a 2003 baseline of 57 percent. In turn, the share of health in household 
expenditure has dropped from a baseline of 9 percent to 4.8 and 3.1 percent respectively in these 
two oblasts.     

46.
The implementation of the strategy has achieved definite progress in the introduction of 
per-capita financing in primary health care: the per capita financing system has been designed 
and piloted. The legal/regulatory framework for implementing the first phase of the Public 
Health Care Centers financing reforms is in place. The provisions include, amongst others, (a) 
consolidation of the PHC at the rayon level; (b) separation of hospital and PHC budgets; (c) 
increased autonomy of PHC facilities, (d) separate execution, control and reporting of per capita 
health budgets, and (e) separate information systems. The per capita financing (capitation) 
program is under implementation in two oblast that cover 60 percent of the population. However, 
currently per capita allocation of funds is done on a district level, while the largest disparity in 
public expenditure is observed among districts and regions. In the next phase of reform, it is 
envisioned to redistribute health public funds for primary health care at the regional level (i.e., 
pool the fund at regional level). 

47.
Progress with the implementation of the Basic Benefit Package (BBP) is somewhat 
mixed. The BBP has proven an effective tool for converting a large share of out-of-pocket 
payments into legal payments; however, the broad coverage of the benefit package and the 
inefficiencies of the service delivery make the package unsustainable given the limited resources 
the state assigns to health. In September 2008, government redefined the basic package structure 
to help financial sustainability; a pilot to implement these ideas is underway in eight rayons. The 
PDPG operations supported these reforms.  

48.
AIDS awareness improves.  Tajikistan has received around 30 percent of the small grants 
allocated under the Central Asia AIDS project during the first and the second cycles, which 
exceeded original expectations. The grants helped to increase AIDS awareness as was intended. 
Preliminary results show that knowledge of HIV prevention increased from 43 percent of 
respondents in the relevant age group in 2005 to 57.5 percent in 2007. However, it is still below 
the PSRP set for 2009—75 percent.  

69 

 
 
49.
Partial improvements in safe water availability in Dushanbe have taken place.  The 
quality of safe water in Dushanbe has improved despite a slow start and protracted 
implementation of the supporting Dushanbe Water Project. With the rehabilitation of the daily 
sedimentation pond and installation of pumps, the quality of the water in the supply network of 
Dushanbe has improved, with turbidity remaining low even on rainy days. 75 percent of the 
population now receives continuous, 24-hour service; more than 65 percent of the population 
now receives water with low turbidity as compared to 52 percent in 2003. Outside, water 
availability is improving in the 8 towns participating in the Municipal Infrastructure 
Development Project (FY06). A recent impact assessment under the project shows that water 
availability has increased by 20 percent.  

Improve education of the population.

50.
The Bank education program was relevant to the government priorities that were well 
articulated in a comprehensive strategy.  The government, jointly with stakeholders, has put 
forth a National Strategy for Education Development (NSED) that is guiding program design and 
implementation towards the medium term. Bank support has come through the Education 
Modernization Project (EMP) predating the CPS; the Bank has also helped coordinate approval 
and is implementing an EFA/FTI financed project. Both projects are focused on improving 
access and quality from grades 1-11 and strengthening education institutions. In addition, the 
EFA/FTI is contributing to donor harmonization with the government. The authorities recently 
developed and approved a better prioritized and costed strategy as part of the preparation for FTI 
3.  

51.
Attendance and completion rates are up in areas of Bank project implementation; also in 
these areas the bases have been set for improving the quality of the service. In the seven rayons 
covered by the Education Modernization Project, enrollment is close to 100 percent and 
completion rates are at 99.85 percent. Nationwide, the TLSS estimates school attendance at 
about 95 percent, although quality of education is an issue. To address quality, the government, 

70 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with donor support, has been undertaking various activities: (a) new curriculum framework for 
two primary education subjects has been developed and distributed nationally; (b) 300 teachers 
with secondary education have been trained in the pilot areas; (c) fourth grade assessment has 
been developed and pilot tested; and (d) refurbishing of the basic textbooks with 50 new titles 
complete. One hundred percent of schools in pilot rayons have functioning Parent Teacher 
Associations (PTAS) and 416 Parent Teacher Associations have been created. In the targeted 
rayons, 132 schools buildings have been rehabilitated.  

52.
Progress in implementing education per capita financing has exceeded expectations.  
Per-capita funding of schools is the centerpiece for rationalizing resource utilization in the 
education sector. The progress here has gone beyond CPS expectations, with per-capita funding 
in 12 rayons rather than one and plans underway to expand nationwide based on the findings of 
an evaluation of the results thus far.  

53.
Going forward the priority should be given to protecting and consolidating the gains that 
have been made.  These include: national rollover of pilot experience, institutionalization of per 
capital financing and school autonomy, engagement of the community, curriculum up-grading 
and teacher training. Achievement of results expected under the CPS was aided by realistic 
design, commitment of government, and increased capacity at the education ministry. The NSED 
continues to provide the framework for the EFA/FTI funding and the forthcoming SWAp. The 
2008 BEEPS Tajikistan preliminary results point to lack of skilled personnel as one of the major 
constraints to business. Brief and pointed analytical work can delve in greater detail to identify 
the nature of this limitation, and help inform the government and development community on 
ways to address it. 

Second pillar contribution to development outcomes  

54.
The objectives set by the CPS under the second pillar were realistic and have been met 
for the most part, although improvements in water availability (mostly Dushanbe) have been 
slow to come. Downward trends in health and education indicators seem to have been halted; 
definite information will be available with the final publication of TLSS. In water, the situation 
is less clear. Preliminary information from the TLSS suggests the percentage of households 
having access to safe water remains the same as 2003. The compatibility between project 
information and general survey results needs to be examined.  

55.
Overall, the situation in health, education and the availability of potable water remains 
dire, with country indicators lagging the region by far. The on-going crisis puts at risk the gains 
that have been achieved. These can be protected by maintaining funding levels, including the 
salaries of teachers and health personnel so that service delivery units can remain open. In 
addition, the partners should forge ahead with components that have been tested successfully, 
like per capita financing in education and health. The challenge will be to maintain the levels of 
investment. For instance, in education, the Multi-cluster Assessment survey finds that the quality 
of school and health facilities are still not appropriate, especially when it comes to functioning 
properly in winter conditions.  

71 

 
 
 
 
Pillar III: Improve delivery of energy services and exploit the country’s hydropower potential  
56.
The authorities set a high priority on developing the energy potential of the country, 
which already contributed five percent to GDP and was a critical direct input into the production 
of aluminum and indirectly into cotton through irrigation. The CPS strategy centered on 
improving governance, financial performance, and quality of service delivery in the internal 
markets. With a longer term perspective in mind, the CPS focused on helping build the basis for 
Tajikistan to supply regional electricity markets. The main instruments of assistance have been 
the Energy Loss and Recovery project (which is half way through implementation), the Pamir 
Private Power project (close to completion), and dialogue around the preparation of a regional 
project to complete the interconnections. Emergencies made it necessary to provide additional 
financing for Pamir and a self-standing operation (Emergency Energy Assistance project) to help 
with the effects of the harsh winter of 2007-08 (among which was a drastic drop in electricity) 
and to improve the country’s readiness in dealing with future emergencies. The DPO series has 
taken on the policy dialogue.

The quasi-fiscal deficit of the energy sector has been reduced, but by less than expected.  
The CPS sought to help the government reduce the quasi-fiscal deficit associated with public 
enterprise activity, especially energy. The strategy combined tariff realignment, improved 
collection and management improvements in the state companies. Progress includes bringing gas 
sector tariffs to the cost recovery ahead of the original target date (2010). Collection rates in gas 
and electricity are well above targets. The 2008 quasi-fiscal deficit stands at 12 percent, well 
below the level of 15 percent in 2004. However, the contribution of internal funds to finance 
investment is below the 30 percent target, as servicing debt with China to finance the 
construction of the transmission line connecting the country from north to south has reduced the 
availability of internal resources. The country is on track to improve the finances of the sector, 
but must accelerate investments to meter consumption and reduce losses.   

58.
Progress in improving corporate governance at Barki-Tajik has been slow. Although 
delayed, an audit of Barki-Tajik is now available. And because the auditors lacked proper 
information on financial accounts, the audit is incomplete. Overall, concerns with the governance 
of BT continue to linger and are shared by the authorities and development partners. The urgency 
remains to bring to international levels governance in BT so that the company can play a central 
role in the ambitious regional program.  

59.
A more prolonged and bitter cold season than had been the norm and a low water level at 
the main dam created a dire situation during the 2007/2008 winter. The Bank fielded an 
emergency operation that became effective almost a year after Board approval, an indication that 
the country is not adequately prepared to address risks in a timely manner. While the Bank 
helped address the energy crisis, electricity remains a major constraint to business and 
production in general, especially during the winter months (2008-BEEPS). In addition, results 
from the recent Multi-Cluster Assessment survey (October 2008) show that households remain at 
risk due to lack of fuel at hand or resources to purchase it when needed.  

60.
The regional electricity interconnection agenda is roughly on track.  The electricity inter-
connection line, built with the support from the Republic of China, is designed to connect the 
south and the north of the country.  This will break the interdependency with Uzbekistan, which 
now operates the electricity grid control center it inherited from Soviet times. This 
interconnection will not only help connect the country but eventually the region (Kyrgyzstan, 
Tajikistan, Pakistan and Afghanistan) once complementary investments (CASA 1000, financed 
by IDA and others) link regional markets are completed, possibly as early as 2013. In the 
meantime, RAO UES of Russia provided financing and completed the construction of Sangtuda 
1, which helps reduce domestic energy shortages and generate summer surpluses for sale to 
neighbors—possibly Afghanistan. Iran is financing the construction of Sangtuda II.  

61.
Institutional upgrading of the water sector has moved slowly.  The initial design of the 
Dushanbe Water Supply Project envisaged private sector management and participation through 
contract management; ultimately, this did not prove politically feasible. The project has been 
managed by the local water company under the Mayor’s office. Tariff increases and better 
collection practices have raised the ratio of collected revenues to the sum of operational costs, 
adequate maintenance, and project related expenses from 21 percent in 2002 to 65 percent in the 
first nine months of 2008. Improvements have been made in the finances of the companies 
through upward water tariff readjustments and better collection practices, which are feasible now 

73 

 
 
that the quality of the service has improved. Still, the governance of the water company remains 
a concern and is hindering other development partners from making sizeable financial 
contributions needed to carry out the necessary investments, which IDA cannot cover given the 
available envelope. In addition, the Municipal Infrastructure Development Project (FY06) has 
the objective of increasing institutional capacity at the central agency responsible for municipal 
services in small towns outside of Dushanbe and Khodjand.  Progress has been slow given the 
weak institutional capacity and, as a result, the financial and institutional performance of KMK 
has not yet improved significantly. 

Pillar Three: contribution to long-term objectives 

62.
The poor quality of energy supply for the domestic market continues to constrain 
production and has the potential to significantly limit the supply response in the short to 
medium-term. It is likely that the country will remain vulnerable for some time, especially if 
procuring regional supplies of energy continues to be difficult. Governance remains a concern 
for energy and water. In energy, it has (and may continue to) affect the willingness of sound and 
credible international partners to invest in the government’s ambitious plans to be a regional 
player in energy. The lack of transparency at TALCO remains a concern as the country; in fact, 
the firm did not benefit from high world aluminum prices during the past several years due to a 
questionable tolling arrangement. The current drop in international prices is affecting the 
company’s profitability, raising fiscal risks related to lower tax contributions. Good progress has 
been made in developing the regional energy market, which augurs well (for now) given such an 
ambitious undertaking. However, further large hydro investments will require attention on 
account of geopolitical risks and the need to improve the investment climate to attract the large 
foreign investment necessary for its construction.  

Underpinning the strategic objectives: Improve governance and state capacity 

63.
The spirit of the CPS was for the governance work to help all pillars deliver their 
expected results. Hence, governance work was conceived as complementary to the achievement 
of the CPS results and not as an objective in itself. Within the resulting broad governance 
agenda, the Bank focused the bulk of its support on building the capacity of the central 
government as the backbone of a long-term strategy to address the constraints. The main 
components have been (a) public expenditure reform, (b) fiduciary reform, and (c) public 
administration and civil service reforms. Bank support has come through policy dialogue under 
the DPO, the Public Administration Reform Project, analytical work (Programmatic Public 
Expenditure Review (PPER), and Public Sector Pay Policy Note) and the National Statistical 
Capacity Building Project.

Supporting Program: PDPG I, II, and III; Public Administration Reform Project; PDPG I, II, III; PEFA (2007); Programmatic PER.  

64.
The government brought all of its development strategies under a single umbrella—PRSP 
2007. The government met its commitment to consolidate all existing development strategies at 
the time the CPS was approved under a single framework, the National Development Strategy 
(NDS 2006-2015). In 2006, it produced a second and more comprehensive PRSP (2007-2009). 
The strategic integration would help facilitate development of a single budget and the alignment 
between budgetary allocations and national objectives. Already, the allocation of resources to 
health and education has increased in line with national priorities and preliminary expenditure 
tracking for health and education has been undertaken. Given the various crises that have 
occurred since 2007, the bulk of the PRSP activities remain to be implemented.  

65.
Gains have been made in setting the basis for better civil service practices.  The objective 
to decompress the pay scale has been met; further decompression is not advisable given that 
wages for entry level specialists would not be competitive. Transparency in the pay system has 
been improved as bonuses and in-kind payments were integrated into the base pay, thus reducing 
the remaining payments to less than 30 percent of total pay (compared to 75 percent in 2006). A 
new Civil Service Law, approved in 2007, separates political and administrative functions and 
makes merit recruitment through open competition compulsory for administrative positions. 
Between 2006 and 2008, the number of posts advertised for competitive recruitment increased 
from 640 to 1,707. Knowledge of the legal framework is adequate. Although merit based 
selection is an increasing practice, merit based promotion is not well established as the “cadre 
reserve approach” remains the norm. At present, the impact of these measures on actual 
performance has not yet been evaluated as the conceptual framework for a performance appraisal 
system is being put in place during 2009.  

66.
Some progress has been made in public expenditure reform, but capacity remains a 
major constraint.  A 2007 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment 
provided benchmarks to track progress in public financial management (PFM) and identify 

75 

 
 
 
 
weaknesses. Tajikistan was at a relatively low stage in public expenditure reform (see CPIA 
rating—2.6) and the Bank agenda on the ground is ambitious, including gradual introduction of a 
MTEF and a move towards use of country systems. Partial results include the adoption of a new 
Public Procurement Law (May 2006); an impact assessment will be available only with the next 
PEFA. External control was reversed when the President restructured public agencies in late 
2006. The restructuring limits the independence of the external audit body, the State Financial 
Control Committee that was merged into the anti corruption agencies reporting to the President. 
Subsequently, some progress has been made towards the establishment of an independent 
external control. The Public Financial Management Modernization project, which was preceded 
by the Public Sector Reform project, was recently approved by the Board in May 2009.   

67.
Reforms of the structure of public administration have lagged expectations.  Progress in 
reforming public administration includes the reduction in the number of ministries and central 
agencies and the introduction of the principle of separation of service delivery from policy 
formulation. Progress in implementation has been slow as shown by various vertical reviews of 
individual ministries. As a result, achievement of the proposed CPS result “clarification of 
responsibilities between different layers of government at the central, regional and local level” 
remains in mid-stream, with the remaining agenda to be addressed during the next CPS. It is 
difficult to proceed in an environment where a dedicated institutional structure, one that is 
expected to design, manage and monitor broad public administration reforms, is absent.   

CPS contribution to improving governance 

68.
Although the CPS emphasized governance and capacity building as cross-cutting themes, 
this pillar included only work with the central government on civil service, financial 
management and administration. Some progress has been made towards the ambitious agenda, 
which was defined with the long-term in mind. Civil servant salaries are higher and new rules are 
in place for hiring. A strategy for PFM has been adopted as has a new procurement law. On 
administration, progress is less noticeable given a lack of appropriate counterpart for the 
overhaul envisaged. With hindsight, and especially now given the on-going crisis, perhaps 
greater attention should have been given to help the authorities address the multiple crises that 
arise regularly.  

69.
On the broader governance picture, the impact of the CPS program has been subdued and 
not much progress has been made in improving sector governance, as had been expected. The 
collapse of governance at the NBT caught all external observers by surprise. The IMF is now 
leading the dialogue on getting NBT on track and taking the corrective measures that follow 
from the recent audit. It remains to be seen what corrective actions the authorities will take 
outside the NBT pursuant to the audit’s findings. Such measures will signal the willingness of 
the authorities to move towards greater accountability. Governance improvements in energy 
include the completion of the Barki-Tajik audit (although with a delay and a disclaimer due to 
inadequate financial information on the company’s operations). The CPS kept the program out of 
aluminum by design, but governance concerns remain with regard to the Tajik Aluminum Plant 
(TADAZ) and with TALCO, a new company carved out to deal with international transactions. 
Governance issues in cotton remain intractable.  

76 

 
 
 
 
IV.

BANK PERFORMANCE 

70.
Delivery of operations set out in the FY06-09 CPS is on track but with a delay, as Table 1 
shows.  One operation was dropped (Poverty Alleviation III) and three operations are under 
preparation (Regional Electricity, Health and Education SWAp). Several operations were added 
to the indicative IDA program outlined in the CPS: (i) an Avian Flu Project in FY07; (ii) a 
supplemental credit to the ongoing Dushanbe Water Supply Project; and (iii) a Youth 
Development Grant funded by the Post-Conflict Trust Fund. Emergency projects including a 
standalone Energy Emergency project, additional financing for Pamir Private Power, and Food 
Security and Seeds imports were delivered in 2008. Tajikistan also benefited from the FTI in 
2006 (IDA and other donors contributed US$18 million in grant terms over a two year period).  

71.
A large number of small projects consume the supervision budget, reducing the resources 
available for AAA.  Today, 15 IDA operations are under implementation and the balance of 
funds (approved and not yet disbursed) adds up to US$141.9 million. The distribution of 
approved and undisbursed resources is aligned with the CPS. The portfolio also included 30 
operations financed by trust funds (including IFC, WBI, Avian Flu, FTI, Food Price Crisis, GEF) 
with total commitment of US$65 million (equivalent to the remainder of IDA15 allocation), of 
which US$30 million are undisbursed. Jumbo Trust Funds represent the bulk of the portfolio, 
and the education sector accounted for about 30 percent of all trust funds. There are also smaller 
sized Trust Funds, such as 3 Institutional Development Funds (IDFs) (characterized by slow 
implementation), a First Initiative grant, and PHRD grants for project development.  

72.
The CPS delivered financial resources to the budget in line with the initial estimates.  
During the CPS period, IDA disbursed U$410 million, which was slightly less than the 
US$433.5 million in the original disbursement estimates. Most of the projects disbursed much 
quicker than originally expected. However, the Ferghana Valley, Land Registration and Cotton 
Sector Recovery projects brought the performance down.  

73.
The mix of investment and development policy lending has been in line with the CPS 
outline.  As planned, a PDPG series is providing a platform for policy dialogue with government 
on a broad range of themes (mostly capacity and competitiveness) and supporting the 
implementation of the investment projects. The full PDPG series (3 operations) have been 
delivered, with a delay in the delivery of PDPG III due to the need for the government to 
complete the IMF SMP. An ICR for the PDPG series is pending.  

74.
The three PDPG operations drove the policy dialogue with the authorities and helped 
coordinate implementation of the CPS program, contributing to the achievement of a significant 
share of CPS results. Its agenda was broad, touching on all of the core areas of the CPS. It has 
helped to promote private sector development by supporting liberalization of the aviation sector, 
encouraging transparency in the privatization of SOEs, and supporting adoption of laws to 
prevent monopolistic practices. With IFC, it has moved along the agenda on reducing the 
regulatory burden of inspections and licenses. In agriculture, it has targeted measures to give 
farmers a better deal, with positive results towards the end of the period. It has supported the 
dialogue on financing of education and health services and helped to ensure that budget 
allocations for the services were protected during the recent global economic crisis. It has 
promoted greater efficiency and financial viability of the energy sector through support for better 

77 

 
 
corporate and financial management. On public sector management, the PDPG has supported 
significant public financial management reforms, including adoption of a new procurement law, 
establishment of an external audit function, strengthening of internal audit, and civil service pay 
reform. To achieve these results, PDPG worked with sectors and IFC where investment 
operations are ongoing, and mobilized additional resources from other donors to advance the 
agenda. However the degree of coordination with sector teams varied considerably from one 
sector to another and this is an area for further improvement. 

75.
Despite its successes, the difficult environment has affected PDPG implementation, 
particularly the crisis at NBT, which led to delays in preparing PDPG 3. The PDPG operation 
has been most successful in areas for which government ownership has been strong, technical 
assistance has been available (from the Bank or other donors), consensus among other 
development partners on the way forward has been forged, and engagement on the issues has 
been long term. A thorough assessment of its contribution to the country's reform agenda, in this 
difficult environment, will have to wait for the ICR. Continuing with the PDPG operation will 
help to deepen the reform agenda that is underway and to support reforms in emerging areas.   

76.
AAA has contributed to advancing the program in various ways, but some have come 
with a delay.  AAA work contributed to the preparation of the 2006-2009 PRSP, the PDPG 
dialogue and project design. The PPER process supported Tajikistan’s first PEFA self- 
assessment, in partnership with the Swiss Economic Cooperation (SECO), in January 2007. In 
addition, the PPER has taken stock of health and education issues and debt sustainability. The 
TLSS completed and under processing, covers health, education, labor market participation, food 
security, and access to financial services, children immunization, and other themes. Its results 
will allow the government and the development partners to take stock of progress towards PRSP 
outcomes. Policy notes include a poverty profile at the national and regional levels; migration 
and labor markets; food security; gender aspects of access to land and financial assets; access to 
and quality of public health and education services; and social safety nets. UNICEF, DFID, and 
the government are the main contributors. Other AAA includes a Fiduciary Assessment of the 
Education and Health Sectors, Fiduciary Assessment of Tajikistan’s Portfolio, sector strategies for 
agriculture and private sector development, and three policy notes on Enhancing Development 
Impact of Remittances, Civil Service Wages, and Aviation. AAA work has been of good quality, 
informative, and, for the most part, timely (with an exception of the CEM that is expected to be 
completed in FY10).  

77.
Portfolio quality has deteriorated slightly during the implementation of the CPS. At the 
beginning of the CPS, the portfolio did not have problem projects (although 3 projects were rated 
not likely to meet their Development Objectives). Today, 5 projects are at risk, of which one has 
a moderately unsatisfactory development objective that represents a significant deterioration in 
portfolio performance since the start of the CPS. The disbursement rate is at 38.1 percent in 
FY09, compared to an ECA average of 17.1 percent.  

78.
IDA has emphasized training for policy makers, including several high-level leadership 
seminars.   IDA, in collaboration with WBI, organized a high-level workshop in February 2006 
for the economic and social team of the government, which was very well received. A 
subsequent leadership seminar for the new Cabinet of Ministers was held in April 2007 and 
focused on the strategic reform priorities for Tajikistan and showcased the experiences of a 

78 

 
 
number of more advanced countries. Most recently, a high level seminar for crisis management 
brought to Tajikistan several high level international practitioners to share their experiences with the 
authorities.   

79.
Periodic CPPRs have tracked gradual progress in addressing key implementation 
concerns.  The action plan agreed to at the third government-IDA-ADB CPPR, held in October 
2006, focused on resolving four systemic issues: mainstreaming Project Implementation Units 
(PIUs); orienting project implementation towards outcomes; resolving taxation issues; and 
expediting government procedures on project selection, approval and implementation. The fourth 
government-IDA-ADB CPPR 
(2008) 
took stock of progress 
in 
implementing 
the 
recommendations of the 2006 CPPR and reports: 

(cid:120) Development partners’ efforts to reduce the costs of project implementation through 
more integrated mechanisms and the use of country institutions have brought several 
projects under the same implementation unit, such as in the energy sector the Center for 
Management of Projects that implements eight energy infrastructure projects. However, 
differences in fiduciary, reporting and accountability systems of the government and 
development partners are retarding implementation of more integrated agendas. To 
address this concern, ADB and the WB have streamlined and harmonized their 
operational procedures. In addition, the WB has been moving away from self-standing 
PIUs for project implementation. , Of 18 projects, 10 are implemented by stand-alone 
PIUs, six are implemented by their respective ministries or agencies, two by a state-
owned enterprise (Barki-Tajik), and another by a private company (Pamir Energy). The 
gradual approach to phasing out PIUs has been necessary to avoid potentially sharp drops 
in performance.  

(cid:120) A recent fiduciary review of Bank operations in Tajikistan did not find any evidence of 
fraud, but did find ample room for improvement. Physical inspection of the works 
undertaken showed that 67 percent had deficiencies due to poor quality of materials and 
workmanship, use of second hand materials in construction, and lack of proper 
maintenance. Only 37 percent of procurement was rated fully satisfactory, while only 16 
percent was unsatisfactory. The review identified the following: (a) the need for tighter 
adherence to agreed procurement procedures, (b) inadequate competition from inside and 
outside Tajikistan, and (c) weak Borrower’s contract administration procedures. As to 
financial management, the review rated 39 percent as fully satisfactory with 17 percent 
either fully or highly unsatisfactory. The review found that competitive and adequate 
salaries strengthen implementation by attracting better qualified and experienced 
financial management and disbursement staff.  

(cid:120) Since the 2006 CPPR, efforts to improve the monitoring and evaluation of projects has 
produced gains but monitoring & evaluation (M&E) remains weak with several projects 
still lacking them on account of limited in-country capacity and training opportunities. 
The consequence is that the government and development partners lack information for a 
timely assessment of performance and the needed corrections to avoid delays and deliver 
on results.   

79 

 
 
80.
Coordination among development partners is improving.  At the beginning of the CPS, 
partners faced a large number of fragmented operations that increased the cost of delivering 
assistance and, at times, provided contradictory advice. Partners are now working on developing 
joint project implementation units and co-financing interventions around common agendas. 
Examples include an FTI grant; co-financing for the Basic Community Health Project from the 
Swedish Agency for Development Cooperation (SIDA) and the Swiss Development Corporation 
(SDC); co-financing of the National Statistical Capacity Building Project by SIDA and DFID; 
work on public expenditure management with DFID, Swiss SECO; and cooperation with 
UNICEF. IDA has led the way for the establishment of the Donor Coordination Council in 
Dushanbe.   

81.
The CPS identified the risks well, but the country and partners could have done a better 
job of developing and implementing remedies. While the CPS foresaw the risk to the country 
associated with a global slowdown, the authorities did not take advantage of the four good years 
for building up reserves. Nor did the country take advantage of the favorable climate to 
implement reform to improve supply conditions and generate income opportunities; instead, it 
relied on exporting labor to release the political and economic pressures emanating from a 
growing population. The energy crisis, not foreseen in the CPS, evidenced the vulnerability of 
the economy to external shocks. Despite all of this, the country has maintained political stability.  

V.

LESSONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

82.
The implementation of the CPS teaches that ambitious reform agendas in weak 
institutional environments can easily overburden the authorities. Acknowledging the lack of 
capacity is not enough; the program should also embed this awareness in a credible way. In this 
CPS, the strategy of building the capacity of the central government represented a long-term 
approach, which was not fully relevant to the challenges that the authorities faced. As a result, 
despite high growth and improvement in social indicators, governance failures became even 
more evident. Today, the country faces several crises: a drop in remittances, low world prices for 
cotton and aluminum, a drop in public revenues, a frail financial system, returning migrants, 
weak capacity, and tarnished credibility.  

83.
CPS implementation teaches that progress comes when programs target well-defined 
outcomes and factor in capacity constraints through intensive AAA, and allow adequate time and 
dedication for policy dialogue and technical assistance, all characteristics of the PDPG operation. 
Therefore, this review calls for realism in program design and adherence to strict prioritization. 
Such an approach will assure prompt delivery of results that generate a virtuous cycle, rather 
than disperse and lead to incomplete efforts that harm the credibility of the initiatives. A more 
realistic approach requires scaling-down overambitious goals, identifying risk sources, and 
providing capacity-building support according to needs. The next strategy may focus on 
implementing the laws and strategies currently in place; and when trying to arrive at “new 
institutional frameworks,” it should consider using experimentation and dialogue rather than 
imposing the design on the client and thereby risking limited understanding and buy-in.   

80 

 
 
A. Strategic Recommendations: Sharpening the Results Agenda 

84.
The CPS agenda remains valid as does the 2007 PRSP, but the crisis adds new urgencies 
that must be addressed within a vision that acknowledges that the favorable events of the last 
four years are not likely to recur over the medium to long-term. In facing this new reality, the 
team must review the relevance and adequacy of the operations in place and then focus the next 
strategy on realistic results concomitant with the capacity of the country and the emergency of 
the situation.  

85.
Building credibility and addressing the current emergencies. The loss of credibility from 
the various governance failures handicaps the ability of the country to deal with the current 
crisis. Reportedly, under IMF guidance, the authorities will be taking corrective measures at the 
NBT, but the authorities have yet to address issues of accountability. The extent and enthusiasm 
of development partners’ support will depend on assurances of a proper use of resources that 
help the poor and preserve the gains made thus far. The credibility of the government will hinge 
on decisions made about the allocation of resources, their use in the budget, and impact on the 
ground. Over the longer haul, credibility based on better governance will help bring in the 
international partners that Tajikistan needs to carry out its vision of development, especially in 
the energy sector.   

86.
Generating an elastic domestic supply of goods and services is critical to handling the 
short, medium and long-term challenges.  Constraints to domestic supply remain high. The 
analytical work either completed or nearing completion (2008 BEEPS, CEM, LSS, etc.) can 
inform partners on the immediate priorities to generate a healthy supply response. Attention will 
have to be paid to energy availability, which ranks as one of the highest constraints, and access 
to finance. The Bank needs to think of alternative forms of engagement in agriculture, such as 
reallocating efforts away from cotton to agricultural diversification, rural finance and 
institutional building. Expansion of the non-cotton economy offers considerable opportunities. 
Developing regional energy markets remains relevant, but the partners must face the hurdles in 
place systematically and promptly. These include improving drastically the governance in Barki-
Tajik, addressing the concerns of the neighboring countries on the impact on water supply 
downstream, and developing solid contractual schemes for energy export.   

87.
A priority in health and education should be consolidating the gains by further 
strengthening the ministries, scaling up the pilot experiences, and addressing skill shortages. A 
short-term priority should be maintaining the gains by protecting expenditure, including salaries 
of teachers and health workers. The forward agenda could consider strengthening the social 
assistance system to help the needy through the crisis. Over the longer-term, the scaling-up of 
pilot experiences will require resources and selecting adequate technologies—not necessarily 
those used at the pilot scale–that give maximum impact. Improving the quality of water will need 
massive resources, which requires the engagement of the broader donor community and 
improvements in sector governance. The crisis should not hinder continuation of key initiatives, 
such as per-capita allocation of budget resources in education and primary health care and the 
basic package of health services.  

81 

 
 
B. Operational Recommendations

88.
Embrace a selectivity policy.  The previous strategy announced a policy of selectivity but 
did not deliver on it. The new strategy has to. Managing a large number of small operations 
consumes valuable budget resources that could be used for strengthening supervision, AAA and 
policy dialogue. Besides reducing the number of operations, a policy of selectivity must also be 
applied at the sector level as part of a strategy to avoid an overambitious agenda. For instance, it 
is not only about remaining engaged in agriculture but about whether to engage a broad agenda 
or rather a few, select, and targeted interventions at a lower scale.   

89.
Continue a mix of DPO and investment. As noted, the DPO was affected by an 
overambitious CPS design in a difficult environment. The DPO did not achieve much, but the 
few results of the CPS (except for health and education) were achieved with the DPO. The 
success of DPO in aviation was due to its focus and a lot of effort. To make the DPO more 
effective, its design should be more focused, and the crisis provides that opportunity. Continued 
DPO will help the government finance the fiscal gap that has emerged with the crisis (even after 
government’s corrective actions to rationalize expenditure). It has proven to be an effective 
instrument for policy dialogue with the government. The theme and prior actions to be included 
in the DPO must benefit from the lessons learned of past experience, new analytical works, and 
emerging realities. The past teaches that DPO works best when it is well focused on concrete 
outcomes and is complemented by intensive technical assistance, given the limited capacity of 
government. It is important that the DPO agenda align with the CPS and be based on analytical 
work, especially the forthcoming CEM. This will help sharpen insights on constraints to growth, 
especially in agriculture. The emerging circumstances call for a focus on the crisis by 
maintaining or protecting the mid-term agenda. The DPO can help organize the Bank support as 
well as cooperation with other development partners. As to investment, priority should be placed 
on completing the ongoing agenda through additional financing. 

90.
Utilize AAA to open new vistas where the issues are unclear or a common view has not 
yet emerged. AAA needs to be used more aggressively as an advocacy instrument in areas where 
there is limited buy-in from the authorities and to raise the relevant issues nationally. Hence, 
greater attention should be placed on dissemination.

Continue efforts to harmonize development partners’ support. Harmonization of 
development partners’ activities can help improve implementation performance, but care should 
be taken that the costs of harmonization and coordination do not outweigh its gains. The partners 
can heed the lessons from the 2008 ADB and WB PCPR that advises working under well 
developed sector agendas that include: (a) fully cost activities, strengthening of capacity 
(planning, budget execution, procurement, tracking and reporting, etc.) at the level of the 
ministries and other executing bodies, (b) the gradual absorption of PIU’s into the administrative 
structures, (c) realistic result frameworks, and (d) agenda or time table to move towards the use 
of country systems. Because it takes time to field such an agenda, the partners may want to 
proceed gradually with a focus first on operational aspects.

Lessons Learned 

Pillar I: Foster broad based growth in urban and rural areas  

Foster Growth in rural 
and urban areas

Business regulations and 
inspections are excessive 
and cumbersome.  

A backlog exists of 
inefficient public 
enterprises.   

The banking sector remains 
small and fragile; medium-
to-long-term finance of the 
SME sector remains 
inadequate  
Slow growth in agriculture 
due to (i) incomplete 
restructuring and 
privatization of farms; (ii) 
the urgent need to 
rehabilitate the irrigation 
infrastructure; (iii) the 
unresolved cotton farm 
debt problem; and (iv) the 
limited competition in 
input and output markets 
for cotton.  

State monopoly in aviation 
maintained Tajikistan 
isolated from the region 
and the world at large.  

Laws on inspections and 
licensing adopted. Despite 
efforts, Tajikistan continues 
to lag most of the rest of the 
world on the quality of the 
business environment. The 
2008 BEEPS survey found a 
wide range of constrains to 
growth.  
Implementation of the 2004 
Privatization Program led to 
the sale of around 500 large 
and medium enterprises. 
However, state continues to 
own the largest and most 
strategic enterprises in the 
country.  
The Banking sector has 
grown but it remains fragile, 
in part because the 
government’s channeling of 
cotton finance.  
Non-cotton agriculture is 
taking off, not so cotton areas 
where poverty is on the 
increase. Restructuring and 
privatization of farms 
continues at a slow pace, 
especially titling of the land, 
which fell below expectations 
and affected negatively 
progress on irrigation. The 
so-called “cotton farm debt 
problem” led to a serious 
governance failure carrying a 
high fiscal cost as the central 
government absorbs the bulk 
of the debt. The government 
introduced competition in the 
input and output markets 
towards the end of the period 
(2008/2009.)  
Deregulation of the aviation 
sector has brought in new 
players improving the 
connection of Tajikistan to 
the rest of the world.   

Providing the needed 
business environment to 
generate an elastic response 
and help address the crisis 
needs a concerted effort, 
moving beyond the selected 
interventions of the past.   

Tajikistan has reached the 
limits of privatization as 
privatization of the large 
enterprises seems unlikely; 
priority should now go to 
improve public enterprise 
corporate governance.   

The frailty of the banking 
sector could amplify the 
crisis if unattended.    

Rapid transformation of 
agriculture requires 
certainty of property rights 
and freedom to farm, 
including the cotton areas, 
which are the most fertile in 
the country.  Clear property 
rights will speed 
improvements in irrigation.  
Likewise, given the high 
fiscal cost of direct lending 
to cotton, the state should 
minimize its intervention 
and markets work.     

The experience in aviation 
is an example of the gains 
Tajikistan can achieve 
through deregulation.

Likewise, the number of

Public spending in primary 
health is higher now (2008) 
than in 2004.  
The share of household 
expenditure has dropped to 
4.8% and 3.1% in Sogd and

of HIV prevention increased

Primary enrollment is at 
100% and completion rates at 
99.85% in the areas with IDA 
support. Nationwide the 
enrollment rate is at 95%.   
At the pilot level, teachers 
with secondary education 
have been trained, textbooks 
provided, assessments tested 
and parent and teacher 
associations created (416.) At 
national level, new curricula 
for two subjects have been 
introduced.

After a delay, finally water 
quality is improving in 
Dushanbe. Onwards, the 
size of the investment 
needed is such that a 
broader engagement of the 
development community is 
needed; however, this 
requires addressing 
governance concerns at the 
municipal level. 
Like in health, the pilot 
approach has helped address 
capacity constraints. In 
addition, the education 
strategy is perhaps the most 
advanced in the country. 
The crisis calls for attention 
to preserving gains and 
scaling up, primarily the 
nationwide implementation 
of per capita financing, the 
training of teachers and the 
modernization of the 
curriculum.

Annex 3:  CPS Stakeholder Consultations 

1.
Process. CPS consultations were held in four cities in Tajikistan (Dushanbe, Kurgan-
Tube, Khojand, and Khorog) during September 8-17, 2009 with representatives of various 
stakeholders including central and local regional governments, non-governmental organizations 
and private sector representatives, the Parliament and donor organizations. The CPS outreach 
was broad especially in the regions and discussions with stakeholders were highly participatory 
and interactive. The consultations sought to validate the analytical underpinning of the CPS, 
share the lessons learned from implementation of the previous CPS, and seek their inputs on the 
CPS strategic objectives, the proposed program and priorities. The challenges and opportunities 
for CPS implementation were discussed with various stakeholders. This included fiduciary, 
institutional, environmental and the external risks. These inputs will enable the WBG to respond 
to new demands and to adjust its program appropriately during the implementation period.  

2.
As the CPS Board discussion was postponed from November 2009 to May 25, 2010, 
the WBG held the second round of CPS consultation both with senior government officials 
and Civil Society Organizations (CSOs). Consultation with senior government officials held at 
various times during December 2009-February 2010. Consultation with CSOs was held on 
March 31, 2010 because the CSOs requested to broaden and deepen consultation of the CPS. 
CSOs expressed their high appreciation to the Bank in organizing the second consultation and 
they actively participated in the CPS discussions and provided their comments and inputs to the 
Bank team. In total representatives of 42 CSOs participated during the second consultation 
including international organizations and academic institutions.  

3.
Topics for discussion. The consultations served as a platform for informative exchange 
with the central and regional governments, civil society organizations, and development partners 
on the key development challenges affecting Tajikistan. They also sought inputs from the 
stakeholders on the proposed CPS program that address these challenges. The main topics 
discussed included (a) economic and governance context; (b) lessons learned from past World 
Bank Group engagement; (c) CPS Strategic Objectives; and (d) the proposed program and 
priorities. During the last round, the consultation with the government focused mostly on specific 
issues including the Bank’s support in conducting assessments for the construction of the 
Roghun hydropower plant in the CPS context and the use of IDA Crisis Window. The 
consultation also focused on recent changes introduced to the CPS including the WBG 
commitment in conducting techno-economical, environmental and social assessments, PRSP III, 
and the use of IDA Crisis Window. During the discussion, the participants raised issues of 
CSOs’ participation in the CPS program, construction of Rogun hydropower station in 
Tajikistan, and transparency of WB activities in Tajikistan.  

4.
Results. The consultations provided excellent opportunity for the WBG to learn the 
views of various stakeholders both government and non-governmental partners about the 
relevance of the proposed CPS in Tajikistan. The issues of governance at national and local 
levels and weak fiduciary control were major concerns raised by participants. They were in 
agreement with the CPS objectives and the proposed program that focuses on community 
agriculture and rural development, climate changes, energy and water 
infrastructure 
rehabilitation, education, and health. There was a diversity of views on sectoral coordination and 

89 

 
 
capacity related issues. Stakeholders welcomed closer collaboration and dialogue in the course of 
CPS implementation, its monitoring and evaluation.  

5.
Feedback inputs from consultations include general issues related to the CPS. 
Participants raised concerns about (a) the commitment and capacity of the government to design 
and implement needed reforms and weak implementation capacities at both central and local 
administrations; (b) limited transparency and accountability of governmental structures utilizing 
donor’s aid; (c) prioritization among economic, infrastructure and social priority in view of 
limited available resources; (d) transparency of WB activities through timely dissemination of 
information about the WB activities using the web and TV and to conduct a joint consultation 
meeting with the other stakeholders, such as ministries and other government actors. They 
supported the Bank’s role in (a) protecting social sector expenditure to meet its social obligations 
through budgetary support; (b) easing the complexity and implementation of the regional water 
and energy projects, involving neighboring countries, (c) improving donor’s coordination; and 
(d) greater involving non-governmental organizations in the monitoring and evaluation, 
especially in some projects such as migration, Emergency Food Crisis and Seed Imports, gender 
issue, health and education, and anti-corruption. CSOs noted that the Civil Society Small Grant 
program is too small given the many important issues that need to be addressed in Tajikistan. 

6.
Participants in the CPS consultations also provided feedback specifically related to 
sector issues.  In the energy sector, participants suggested the WBG to identify a key energy 
sub-sector that could be developed in a sustainable manner.  They recognized the need to explore 
hydro power generation opportunities and identify the environmental risks for downstream 
countries. They suggested that Tajikistan make use of the Clean Energy Development 
Mechanism and wanted to know the role of CSOs in the technical, economical and social impact 
studies of the Rogun. CSOs raised concerns about the government’s sales of the Rogun shares to 
the public and businesses and the transparency in the use of the Rogun’s funds. In the 
agricultural and rural development sector, participants recognized the need to rehabilitate 
agriculture and irrigation infrastructure and to provide high-quality seeds that critical for farmer 
survival.  They supported private farming and agribusiness through value chain management, 
equitable land reform and transparent process of cotton debt resolution, improved access to the 
rural finance, and mountainous regions economic development and tourism. In the education 
sector, they encouraged the Bank to support school rehabilitations in remote regions, expand FTI 
to train more teachers, and continue education financing reform. In the health sector, participants 
suggested the Bank to revisit family medicine, rehabilitate rural health facilities, and pay more 
attention to HIV/AIDS, especially among returning migrants. In migration, participants 
suggested the Bank to expand vocational skills development programs, and use returning 
migrants for private sector development and new businesses. In the finance and banking sector, 
they suggested that the Bank improve access to long-term credit, expand microfinance scheme, 
increase trade financing and support leasing financing. To address cross cutting issues, 
participants indicated the need to update gender analysis, girl’s education to receive more 
priority and address climate change issues such as analysis of glaciers melting and land 
degradation. On Gender, the CSOs suggested that international organizations coordinate their 
effort in addressing gender issues; On Youth, participants suggested that the WB develop a 
poverty strategy document for the young people.

Overall Conclusions. 

a. The Bank has been a respected partner for Tajikistan and still has a role to play due to 
its expertise and its analytical works.   
b. Main priorities for further Bank work in Tajikistan should address the need to meet 
long-term challenges in sustainable economic and social development, improved 
capacities and governance reforms. 
c. Key areas for development in partnership with the Bank include water and energy, 
agriculture and rural development, health, education. 
d. The Bank will encourage the government to increase CSOs involvement in the Bank-
financed projects through intensification of communication to CSOs about the WB 
activities, and about potential areas of involvement.

Annex 4:  Country Governance and Anti Corruption Strategy 

I.

INTRODUCTION

1.
Tajikistan as a CGAC Country. Tajikistan was selected by regional management as 
one of four countries in the ECA region to pilot the CGAC process. This approach involves 
increased attention to governance in both strategic and operational aspects of World Bank 
assistance to client countries. Based on lessons learned during implementation of the previous 
CPS, the World Bank’s engagement on governance in Tajikistan will move toward 
mainstreaming governance at the national, sector, and project levels. “Mainstreaming” is the 
approach to governance reform in Tajikistan that has been developed in response to lessons 
learned under the previous CPS, where efforts to address governance were restricted to the 
central government level and not well integrated into sector approaches or individual program 
design. Mainstreaming does not mean abandoning central government governance reforms, but 
complementing them with emphasizing sector and project level interventions.33 

2.
Basic Framework for the Tajikistan CGAC Strategy. Within the CGAC framework, 
the World Bank will assist the Government of Tajikistan in tackling three principal governance 
challenges: (a) strengthening transparency and accountability; (b) developing capacity; and (c) 
fostering demand for good governance. Governance interventions will be mainstreamed 
throughout the portfolio, with an emphasis on consolidating and/or scaling up existing 
instruments of engagement to achieve strategic goals. A major innovation of this strategy is the 
development and adoption of a Governance Checklist for Tajikistan, a new project-level tool to 
ensure proper attention to three governance challenges at all stages of the project cycle in all new 
and reviewed operations. 

3.

Tackling the Three Governance Challenges.   

(cid:120) Strengthening Transparency and Accountability is a wide-ranging challenge in 
Tajikistan, which requires diverse interventions in the Bank Group’s portfolio. These 
include, but are not limited to: supporting audits of SOEs; developing a transparent 
civil service classification and pay grading system; improving transparency of budget 
preparation and execution through effective business processes; installing digital 
electricity meters to ensure transparency of usage, charges, and payments; and 
introducing per-capita financing in schools and primary health care facilities.  

(cid:120) Capacity Development refers not only to individual skill-building initiatives, such as 
training, but also to institutional and organizational development, and strengthening 

33 Governance challenges and risks at the country and sector levels relate to legislative and regulatory frameworks 
for ensuring transparency, accountability and appropriate incentives for government and economic agents. 
Governance issues at the project level are much more specifically targeted in terms of (sub-) sectoral details, 
locations, agents, etc. Yet these various levels are inextricably linked: governance challenges at country and sector 
level (e.g., unsatisfactory sector policy framework, lack of policy coordination, lack of reform ownership, fiduciary 
risks) translate into risks to successful project implementation and achievement of project’s development objectives. 
Addressing governance challenges at the country and sector level must therefore go hand in hand with efforts to 
address operational governance challenges and risks.   

92 

 
 
                                                 
 
the government’s capacity for policy development and management. Specific 
interventions in this area include: supporting the PFM Council to manage various 
aspects of PFM agenda; providing technical assistance (TA) to the health sector on 
budget management; providing TA to strengthen management of infrastructure and 
energy utility service operations; and building capacity in the Ministry of Education 
to engage in data-driven policy making and results monitoring.

(cid:120) Fostering Demand for Good Governance focuses on partnering with entities other 
than the executive branch of government to promote accountability in the executive 
and societal ownership of reforms. Interventions include: strengthening parliamentary 
oversight of the budget process; creating and working with Parent-Teacher 
Associations (PTAs) in pilot schools; creating and empowering community-based 
organizations to manage communal water distribution systems; training and providing 
information to rural cotton producers; and involving Water User Associations in 
issuing land certificates in pilot areas. Table 1 provides an overview of existing 
instruments in the Bank portfolio that will carry out and/or scale up these

Tajikistan Portfolio Governance Checklist. One of the main innovations of the 
Tajikistan CGAC is to mainstream efforts to tackle the three governance challenges through the 
application of a Governance Checklist in all sectors for every new operation, additional 
financing, or midterm review. The checklist contains a series of questions to be asked by the 
country management unit (CMU) to ensure that governance implications are considered in the 
design and implementation of programs, that governance interventions are channeled through 
operations, and that each operation in the portfolio contributes to improving the governance 
environment in Tajikistan. This tool is also designed to identify sectors and projects where 
additional fiduciary or non-fiduciary safeguards, such as political economy analysis or 
stakeholder analysis, are necessary. The checklist is discussed in Section V and attached in Table 
1. 

94 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.
The CGAC Process in Tajikistan. The formulation of Tajikistan’s CGAC strategy has 
relied on an inclusive and participatory process, building a strong ownership within the Bank’s 
country team. The process began with a brainstorming session among country office staff in 
Dushanbe in December 2008, during which a CGAC Matrix was developed. The matrix 
presented a list of governance challenges, as well as entry points and instruments for tackling 
them at the country, sector, and project levels. The main lesson from this brainstorming session 
was that the Bank’s portfolio already contained many governance interventions, but these 
interventions often went undocumented and did not follow an explicitly defined, coherent 
strategy. Consequently, the Tajikistan portfolio underwent a mini-governance review in March-
April 2009. Most governance interventions being undertaken within ongoing lending operations 
were recorded and categorized, and the basic storyline for approaching governance in the 
Tajikistan CPS for FY10-12 was developed. The process culminated with a Country Team 
CGAC Workshop in Dushanbe in May 2009, during which the country team provided valuable 
inputs to the CPS approach to governance and participated in structured brainstorming to 
develop the Governance Checklist. 

6.
Roadmap for This Document. Section II of this CGAC strategy document provides 
some background on the governance approach undertaken in the previous CPS and reviews the 
most recent governance developments in Tajikistan. Section III discusses governance at the 
country Level, including an analysis of cross-country governance indicators and their 
implications for the three governance challenges. Section IV reviews strategies for tackling 
governance at the sector level, particularly in sustainable development, human development, and 
private and financial sector development. Section V proposes a governance strategy at the project 
level, including adoption of the Governance Checklist and strengthening of fiduciary safeguards. 
Section VI describes how these interventions will be scaled up at all levels, given that the 
Governance Partnership Facility Window 1 funds have become available. Finally, Section VII 
outlines a process for M&E of CGAC results in the context of the CPS. 

II.

BACKGROUND

7.
Governance in the Previous CPS. The CPS (FY06-FY09) considered governance a 
significant challenge to development in Tajikistan, drawing on the premise that the main 
governance weaknesses stemmed from the legacy of the civil war, necessitating a move from 
security consolidation to construction of a modern state, and resulting in a complex political 
economy. The aluminum and cotton sectors were considered to be particularly plagued by 
interference of political power and vested interests. Low salaries in the public service led to low 
accountability. Under the last CPS, the Bank focused the bulk of its support on building capacity 
within the central government as the backbone of a long-term strategy to address governance 
constraints. The main components of this governance strategy were public expenditure reform, 
fiduciary reform, and public administration and civil service reforms. Bank support took the 
form of policy dialogue under the PDPG, Public Administration Reform Project, Statistical 
Support Project, and analytical work such as functional reviews and a Public Sector Pay Policy 
Note. Progress has been slow, however, and achievement of the CPS results has been less than 
expected due to insufficient political will, weak commitment, and lack of capacity.  

95 

 
 
 
8.
Current Governance Situation: Rebuilding Credibility at the National and Sector 
Levels. During the previous CPS period, dysfunctional governance arrangements in Tajikistan 
were revealed in a series of critical domestic policy slippages. In 2007, it was discovered that the 
NBT provided a series of guarantees and pledges to private companies in the cotton sector 
without reporting them to the IMF. This misreporting constituted a misstep in monetary policy 
and contributed to undermining macroeconomic performance. In addition, the government’s 
credibility in the eyes of its own people was eroded by critical energy shortages during the severe 
winter of 2008, poor performance of SOEs in the energy sector (especially Barki-Tajik and Tajik 
Gas), and low capacity to manage global food and fuel crises that erupted in 2008. However, 
some long-standing institutional reforms being undertaken in the executive branch have begun to 
show results recently. Rule-based management is taking root in the civil service. The MoF is 
introducing a new administrative budget classification to better track public expenditure. The 
Ministry of Labor and Social Protection is improving its systems through more efficient 
functional assignments and efforts to enhance accountability. The Ministry of Justice is 
improving access to justice through the Adliya database of legislative information and the 
monthly Official Bulletin of Legal Acts.  

9.
Current Governance Situation: Fiduciary Risks at the Project Level. In addition to 
creating challenges for overall national development, Tajikistan’s governance environment also 
poses risks to Bank operations. Though ongoing efforts to strengthen country systems are 
expected to help lower these risks over the medium-term, the Bank needs to safeguard against 
them in the short term. The weak fiduciary environment results from low government capacity 
combined with limited transparency in public financial management. A CPFR conducted in 2008 
found that, in virtually every project, procurement did not adhere to agreed-upon procedures. In 
some cases, procurement proceeded despite inadequate competition for goods, works, and 
services among vendors within and outside Tajikistan. Weak contract administration was 
identified as a problem, as physical inspections of civil works in nine projects revealed 
deficiencies in quality of materials, workmanship, and maintenance of equipment, as well as 
instances of procured goods not being used for their intended purpose. Though most projects 
earned marginally satisfactory or better ratings on financial management and disbursement, with 
no evidence of fraud or ineligible expenditures, the review concluded that staff in PIUs had a 
poor understanding of the Bank’s requirements in these areas. These weaknesses represent 
fiduciary risks that must be ring-fenced in project design and implementation. 

10.
Government’s Efforts to Improve the Governance Environment. The government 
appreciates that the gravity of the situation in Tajikistan is such that general statements about 
improving governance will not suffice; instead, there is a need for clear and significant steps to 
demonstrate the government’s commitment to increasing transparency and accountability in the 
country. The government has begun taking such steps, including: (1) completing a special audit 
of the NBT and other parties involved in the misreporting of financial information in the cotton 
sector, with support from Ernst & Young; (2) revising the NBT and commercial banking laws to 
improve transparency and eliminate conflicts of interest; (3) contracting an internationally 
reputable auditing firm to conduct financial audits of  TALCO and the state electricity company 
(Barki Tajik) in 2007; (4) establishing a supervision unit within MoF to regularly monitor the 
financial operations of the ten largest SOEs; (5) establishing a reporting regime for contingent 

96 

 
 
 
liabilities, covering SOEs, public institutions and the NBT; (6) abolishing cotton export licensing 
by the NBT; and (7) agreeing to pursue resolution of the cotton debt resolution in a systematic 
manner, by adopting a Presidential Decree (May 2009), Government Resolution (June 2009), 
and Action Plan agreed to with donors. The latter is expected to become the platform for 
development and implementation of agrarian reforms to ensure freedom to farm, accelerate land 
titling and improve farmers’ access to finance and collateral practices.   All of the above steps 
notwithstanding, this process is at an early stage, and implementation is complicated by low 
management capacity, an unfavorable external environment, multiple economic and financial 
crises, limited resources and support, and the potential threat that popular discontent could lead 
to civil unrest if expectations are not carefully managed. 

11.
Proposed Governance Approach for the Current CPS.  In the complex governance 
environment described above, the Bank must find a meaningful way to engage on governance 
reform in Tajikistan while setting realistic goals and expectations for what can be accomplished 
over the CPS period. In the long run, development effectiveness can be achieved only if 
governance systems are strengthened; the long-term goal of the Bank’s governance engagement 
is therefore to build a transparent and efficient governance system that will make the government 
accountable to its citizens for delivering public goods and services. In the short term, the Bank 
aims to assist the Government of Tajikistan in regaining its credibility among citizens and the 
international community and to engage with a wide range of non-state actors to hold the 
government to account. The Bank will attempt to tackle three principal governance challenges—
strengthening transparency and accountability, developing capacity, and fostering demand for 
good governance—while ring-fencing against risks posed by the complex governance 
environment.   

III.

ENGAGING ON GOVERNANCE AT THE COUNTRY LEVEL 

Diagnostics: Governance Indicators.  

12.
Tajikistan in Cross-Country Comparisons.34 Country-level data suggest that Tajikistan 
fares worse, on average, than regional and income group comparators in addressing the three 
governance challenges addressed in this strategy. Table 2 shows how Tajikistan compares with 
the regional and low-income country averages on governance outcomes (economic growth, 
control of corruption, quality of economic and social policies); governance institutions (quality 
of public administration, rule of law, executive constraints); private sector governance (ease of 
business start-up, management time spent dealing with regulations); and other dimensions of 
governance (public financial management, judicial system, gender empowerment). 

34 Many cross-country governance indicators are available to assess a country’s performance on various dimensions 
of governance as compared to regional and income-group peers. Some of these indicators are “broad,” using 
statistical models to aggregate several pieces of underlying data and provide a general picture of a broad governance 
dimension, such as Voice and Accountability or Rule of Law. Other indicators are “actionable,” measuring a narrow 
governance issue, such as the number of days it takes to register property, or the extent to which the availability of 
budget funds is predictable. The WB supports the development of both types of indicators, including the Worldwide 
Governance Indicators (WGI), BEEPS, DB, PEFA, CPIA), and others. Many other governance indicators are 
available from development partners, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and academic institutions, including 
Polity IV, Freedom House Nations in Transit, Reporters without Borders Freedom of Press Index, and others. 

97 

 
 
                                                 
(cid:120) Strengthening Transparency and Accountability: The most widely discussed 
governance outcome related to transparency and accountability is Control of 
Corruption. WGI 2007 ranks Tajikistan in the 20th percentile (20.3) in the world on 
Control of Corruption, lower than ECA (36.9) and LIC (22.9) averages. As a 
testament to Tajikistan’s non-transparent and burdensome business regulations, DB 
(2009) ranks Tajikistan 168th among 181 countries with respect to the ease of starting 
a business, worse than both the ECA (77) and LIC (119) averages.

(cid:120) Capacity Development: Tajikistan’s CPIA score for Quality of Public Administration 
was 2.5 out of 6.0 in 2008, as compared to the ECA and LIC averages of 3.3 and 2.9, 
respectively, implying that Tajikistan lags in institutional and human capacity in 
public administration. The same index ranks the Quality of Economic Policies at 3.6, 
as compared to ECA (4.1) and LIC (3.4) averages. At 3.0, Tajikistan’s Efficiency of 
Revenue Mobilization also lags behind ECA (3.8) and LIC (3.2) averages.

(cid:120) Fostering Demand For Good Governance: According to Polity IV 2006, Executive 
Constraints in Tajikistan are scored at 3.0, which is below both ECA (5.30) and LIC 
(3.9) averages and suggests that civil society and non-executive branches of 
government need further strengthening in order to ensure accountable and efficient 
executive power. Similarly, WGI ranks Tajikistan in the 10th percentile in the world 
(10.6) on Voice and Accountability, significantly below ECA (40.5) and LIC (27.5) 
averages.

13.
Country-Level Strategy. The data presented above suggest 
that country-level 
governance challenges in Tajikistan are much more profound than in other countries in the 
region or low-income group. Particular caution must therefore be applied in creating realistic 
expectations as to what can be achieved during this CPS period. The most prudent approach is to 
build on existing initiatives and expect incremental gains.   

a. Strengthening Transparency and Accountability at the country level will involve 
the following initiatives:

i.

Policy dialogue on wage reform, PFM reform, external audit, privatization, and 
audit of energy SOEs; civil service reform; public sector restructuring 
(Instrument: PDPG series) 

ii.

iii.

Enhancing transparency and accountability of regulatory management; improving 
access to justice for government and businesses through the Adliya legal 
database; developing a transparent civil service classification and pay grading 
system (Instrument: Public Sector Reform Project) 

Improving transparency of the budget preparation and execution process; 
strengthening internal controls; installing a Financial Management Information 
System (FMIS); supporting an improved budget classification and chart of 
accounts to enhance transparent reporting on budget execution (Instrument: 
Public Financial Management Modernization Project) 

98 

 
 
b. Capacity Development at the country level will include the following activities:

i.

ii.

iii.

Developing sound procurement practices in the Public Procurement Agency 
(Instrument: PDPG) 

Facilitating international training for high-level civil servants; developing the 
training capacity of the Institute for Higher Qualification of Civil Servants; 
strengthening the role of the Executive Office of the President in policy 
coordination; providing budget management TA to improve job classifications 
and wage grid in the health sector (Instrument: Public Sector Reform Project)  

Analyzing capacity gaps in PFM and developing a functioning training 
infrastructure for PFM; supporting the PFM Council in integrating and managing 
different aspects of the PFM agenda (Instrument: Public Financial Management 
Modernization Project)  

c. Fostering Demand for Good Governance at the country level focuses on enhancing 
parliamentary supervision of the budgetary process (Instrument: Public Finance 
Voice and Accountability Trust Fund). The objectives of this new DFID-supported, 
Bank-executed initiative are three-fold: (1) enhancing parliamentary oversight of 
budget preparation and execution;  (2) strengthening communication and media 
coverage of budget issues, both in terms of quantity and quality; and (3) increasing 
citizens’ participation in the budget process at the local government level.

14.
Analytical and Advisory Activities. An Institutional and Governance Review (IGR) will 
be undertaken during the CPS period to assess how fiscal decentralization institutions function, 
both de jure and de facto. Particular attention will be paid to how the existing institutional setup 
contributes to the transparency of fiscal processes, as well as how the accountability of the local 
and central officials is influenced by the institutional structure. This study will provide further 
understanding of institutional incentives and constraints and shed light on more efficient ways to 
tackle governance challenges in this environment. 

15. Mitigating Governance Risks at the Country Level: The Virtual Poverty Fund. 
Given that a development policy operation is in place in Tajikistan, questions on the proper use 
of budget support resources naturally arise in the context of the country’s complex governance 
environment. In order to ring-fence the budget support funds provided under the auspices of the 
PDPG, and thus respond to oversight requirements, a VPF has been created to track crisis-related 
spending of budget support funds. The VPF will tag specific budget expenditures using existing 
budget classifications, link specific resources to ensure budget allocation for these expenditures, 
and thereby monitor the performance of donors’ budget support in supporting pro-poor activities 
(such as improved service delivery to the poor and other priorities set out in the government’s 
Poverty Reduction Strategy), responding to the crisis, and supporting the foundations of a 
medium-term development agenda. The VPF will likely include the following core expenditures: 
(a) untied transfers from the central government to supplement local revenues in poorer local 
governments, (b) subsidies to poorer households for electricity consumption, and (c) adult 
training centers for returning migrants. To monitor the use of funds, the VPF will report on all 
protected expenditures at the central and local levels on a quarterly and annual basis. 

99 

 
 
IV.

ENGAGING ON GOVERNANCE AT THE SECTOR LEVEL 

16.
Tackling Governance Challenges in the Sustainable Development (SD) Sector. SD 
represents the largest portion of the Bank’s portfolio in Tajikistan, comprising the following sub-
sectors: agriculture, energy, water, and infrastructure. Because governance issues in these sub-
sectors vary widely, generalizations of governance challenges and interventions are often 
problematic. Table 3 provides more detail on governance interventions in the SD sub-sectors.   

a. Transparency and Accountability: Engaging at the lowest possible level 
(microcredit to farmers, support for local banks, installing household energy and 
water meters) to increase transparency and improve efficiency of service delivery; 
requiring audit of the financial statements of the large energy SOEs (Barki Tajik, 
Tajik Gas)

b. Capacity Development: Strengthening government policy development capacity 
(cotton debt, competition, land use, role of local government); providing TA for 
implementation of the energy policy framework; providing capacity building for 
the first Tajik Pamir Private Power Project.

c. Demand for Good Governance: Providing training and information campaigns 
for rural populations regarding application for land use certificates and irrigation 
investment; supporting community-based organizations to manage communal 
water distribution systems

d. In addition, activities that combine capacity development and demand for good 
governance include: Building capacity among villagers to become independent 
farmers and take management decisions; creating and training Water User 
Associations to support improved irrigation; training trainers in environmental 
land management

17.
Tackling Governance Challenges in the Human Development (HD) Sector. Though 
significantly smaller than the SD portfolio in Tajikistan, the HD sector is a pioneer in tackling 
governance challenges in education and health, especially in fostering demand for good 
governance by strengthening PTAs, introducing per-capita financing in education, and capacity 
development in health. Table 4 lists planned HD-sector governance interventions in detail. 

a. Transparency and Accountability: Piloting management autonomy and per-
capita financing in general education and primary health care; supporting the 
development of an Education Management Information System and Health 
Management Information System () to enhance accountability by collecting data 
on service utilization, financing, and outcomes; supporting provider payment 
reforms with tracking of funds; introducing transparent co-payments for health 
services 

b. Capacity Development:  At the central level, providing training to the Ministries 
of Health and Education in evidence-based policy making, public procurement, 
financial management, and M&E; at the local level, training PTAs and schools to 

100 

 
 
strengthen school autonomy, procurement and financial management; building 
fiduciary capacity in health at the oblast level 

c. Demand for Good Governance: Supporting participation of PTAs in school 
budget allocation; supporting public access to school budgets; communicating to 
citizens on progress made in health reforms by building the Ministry of Health 
website and developing relationships with the media to report on progress 
(opening of new health facilities, training, etc.) 

18.
Governance Challenges in PFSD. Though there is no investment lending in this sector, 
the Bank has a long-standing engagement on private and financial sector issues in Tajikistan. 
Many private sector development activities have been included in the PDPG series, and the Bank 
is collaborating closely with (IFC to strengthen the business-enabling environment and improve 
the investment climate. 

a. Transparency and Accountability: Policy Dialogue on Business Environment
b. Capacity Development: IDF on Capacity Building for State Investment 
Committee
c. Demand for Good Governance: Support for Entrepreneur Hotline

V.

ENGAGING ON GOVERNANCE AT THE PROJECT LEVEL 

19.
Project-Level Governance Issues in the Context of Country and Sector Level 
Governance. As discussed above, governance challenges at the country and sector levels 
eventually affect project implementation. Projects are ne instrument for tackling governance 
challenges, and this is done through careful project design. The key question becomes: Is a given 
project’s design conducive to tackling broader governance challenges and safeguarding against 
governance risks? 

20.
Governance Checklist. One of the main innovations of the CGAC strategy is the use of 
a Governance Checklist (Table 1) to mainstream governance initiatives in all sectors for every 
new operation, additional financing, or midterm review. The checklist will be applied to each 
new project throughout the project cycle.  The responsible manager is denoted in the Checklist at 
every stage.  The officer’s responsibility will be to ask the Checklist questions and ensure that 
the issues at hand are addressed in the project design.  The Checklist has two parts: Governance 
Challenges and Governance Risks. Where open-ended questions are asked, it is the discretion of 
the responsible manager to evaluate whether the project’s treatment of the governance issue is 
acceptable.  This provision is introduced to recognize that “no one size fits all” projects, and 
there must be a certain degree of specificity and flexibility embedded in the Checklist. 

21.
Governance Challenges versus Governance Risks. The Governance Checklist 
differentiates between governance challenges and governance risks. Challenges are governance 
issues that can be addressed during the current CPS period, such as transparency and 
accountability, capacity development, and demand for good governance. Risks, on the other 
hand, refer to the systemic governance problems that the Bank needs to safeguard against in the 
design and implementation of operations, including fiduciary (procurement and financial 

101 

 
 
management) risks and non-fiduciary (political economy) risks. The checklist contains questions 
to help identify sectors and projects where additional safeguards, such as political economy 
analysis or stakeholder analysis, are necessary. 

22.
Strengthening Fiduciary Safeguards. As a complement and prerequisite for the 
Governance Checklist, the Bank will continue to work with the government to follow up on the 
recommendations of the 2008 CPFR. The Bank Group will work with the government to 
implement an action plan for individual projects and will closely monitor implementation to 
reduce fiduciary risk. The CMU will identify projects that require enhanced supervision for 
contract administration and will develop a list of local and regional technical consultants (e.g., 
engineers, architects) to include in supervision teams. Fiduciary capacity will continue to be 
strengthened through continued delivery of regular procurement and financial management 
training. The Bank will strengthen supervision of procurement under the portfolio, with special 
emphasis on projects where a number of deficiencies have been identified. Moreover, the scope 
of external audit by additional third-party assurance should be expanded to include more in-
depth reviews of systems, procedures and processes, including technical and operational reviews. 
The Bank will adopt a norm for implementation of high-risk projects in which a joint fiduciary 
review and physical inspection are carried out by independent engineers.   

VI.

SCALING UP: GOVERNANCE PARTNERSHIP FACILITY (WINDOW 1) 

23.
Two compatible resource scenarios. The strategy outlined above relies on the existing 
(limited) IDA and Bank administrative resources. As a CGAC country, however, Tajikistan was 
awarded US$2 million in additional financing for governance-related activities from the 
Governance Partnership Facility over the CPS period. The CGAC Strategy outlined above 
represents a baseline scenario that will benefit tremendously from additional resources to deepen 
the Bank’s existing governance engagement. 

24. Mainstreaming Governance in the Tajikistan Portfolio through GPF Window 1 
Grant. The grant is designed to implement CGAC strategy beyond the existing interventions in 
the portfolio. The grant consists of four components mirror CGAC strategy elements: (i) 
Resourcing Governance Checklist, which includes training and manual for TTLs and additional 
resources for project-level political economy analysis; (ii) Enhancing Transparency and 
Accountability in Key Sectors (Agriculture; Energy; Private Sector Development) that involves 
stocktaking of what the Bank is already doing in these sectors, developing sector-wide approach 
to transparency and accountability; and resourcing the implementation; (iii) Developing
Capacity: taking stock of what the Bank has done in the field so far and what it should be doing, 
leading to designing a comprehensive strategy for WB in capacity development, and eventually 
piloting this strategy; (iv) Fostering Demand for Good Governance includes broadening 
existing engagement with CSOs (grants for CSOs monitoring of the Bank projects) and 
deepening engagement in Social Sectors through scaling up our work with PTAs and via 
community health scorecards. 

VII. MONITORING AND EVALUATION 

25.
Alignment between CPS and CGAC M&E. Because this governance strategy is an 
integral part of the CPS, the M&E process will be fully integrated with that of the CPS. As 

102 

 
 
governance interventions are mainstreamed into projects, the CPS results matrix will be used to 
assess the implementation of the CGAC strategy at mid-term and at completion. At the country 
level, progress on the CGAC strategy will be evaluated against the objectives of the Public 
Sector Reform Project, Public Financial Management Modernization Project, PDPG, Public 
Finance Voice and Accountability Trust Fund, and IGR. At the sector level, progress toward 
sectoral improvements in transparency and accountability, capacity development, and demand 
for good governance will be assessed. At the project level, the adoption of governance checklist 
and improvement of the fiduciary safeguards will be appraised.  

26.
Communication Strategy. The alignment of CPS and CGAC communication strategies 
is also crucial, as successful implementation of the CGAC strategy is impossible without a 
sustained effort to maintain dialogue on governance and institution building throughout the CPS 
period. The CGAC strategy will be a part of CPS consultations with the government and 
stakeholders. Continuous dialogue will be supported through the existing program (e.g., PDPG 
policy dialogue, workshops for the Public Sector Reform Project and Public Financial 
Management Modernization Project, PFVA TF, dissemination of the IGR and CEM, as well as 
through occasional governance-related roundtables (e.g., a seminar with the government on 
WGI). The Bank team will also engage in regular internal communication on CGAC activities, 
especially to support use of the Governance Checklist among task team leaders.

GOVERNANCE CHALLENGES 

Transparency and Accountability 

Is there a reliable champion for the 
project (institutions, individuals, 
organizations)? 

Who (among counterparts) is 
responsible and accountable for the 
deliverables of the project? 

Do we have evidence that the 
government is ready to have this 
project? 

What mechanisms do we use for 
proper targeting?  How do we know 
we have reached the targeted 
beneficiaries? 

Capacity Development 

Is there an assessment of the 
capacity of the implementation 
agency? If yes, is there an action

Annex 5:  Donor Coordination and Harmonization in Tajikistan 

1.
Despite growing foreign aid in Tajikistan, resources – estimated at approximately US$36 
per capita in 2006 - remain scarce compared to the development needs. The success of the CPS 
implementation will also depend on continued improvements in donor cooperation and 
harmonization. 

2.
Overseas development assistance (ODA) has increased in terms of the volume of 
funding, the number of projects and development partners.  Based on the UNDP Principals data, 
China has now become the largest donor in Tajikistan, followed by the United Sates. Their 
development aid accounts for, respectively, 43 and 15 percent of total aid disbursed during 2003-
2007.35  The WB ranks third (tied with the EC) and accounts for 7 percent.  Together, China, 
USA, EC and WBG provide an estimated 64 percent of all development aid to Tajikistan. The 
IMF, which is ranked fifth, accounts for 5 percent of the total aid. The remaining 31 percent is 
comprised of ODA from other agencies, mostly bilateral organizations. 

3.
However, aid flows are unpredictable and uneven and impacts of development aid remain 
mixed due to ineffective donor engagement and coordination as well as weak government 
capacity to absorb and coordinate aid. There is greater scope for better use of aid resources by 
improving donor coordination and strengthening government capacity. This annex is organized 
as follows: first, it provides a picture of current ODA programs as well as existing coordination 
mechanisms in the sector; it then discusses the steps taken by the World Bank to strengthen 
government ownership, harmonization, alignment, results and mutual accountability.  

A. An Overview of Development Aid under the proposed CPS Strategic Objectives 

4.
An overview of major development aid activities in Tajikistan is organized around the 
two strategic objectives.  The mapping was based on records of aid programs from the sectoral 
reviews carried out as part of the JCPS) the latest draft JCPS, and updated information from the 
ODA agencies. The purpose of this exercise is to identify potential areas for further Bank 
engagement, as well as areas where the role of the Bank Group needs to be delineated. 

5.
The overview does not present a comprehensive picture of all activities and areas of 
involvement of all development partners active in Tajikistan. The mapping presented in this 
Annex does not capture activities of development partners that have smaller programs. In 
addition, many development partners only participate in the policy dialogue through the Donor 
Coordination Council (DCC) working groups.  

35  Total aid disbursed from 2003 to 2007 is estimated at about US$1.7 billion.

Strategic Objective 1:  Reducing the negative impact of the crisis on poverty and 
vulnerability

Result 1: Maintain Fiscal Stability

6.
The ADB, EC, WB and IMF are the major development partners whose financial 
assistance through grants, project loans, and/or policy-based program loans contribute to 
macroeconomic stability, i.e., management of prudent monetary and fiscal policies. In 2009, their 
support has been shifting towards short-term budgetary assistance to address financing gaps in 
the balance of payments and fiscal account emerging from the impact of the global economic and 
financial crises. The IMF’s ECF for 2009-12 will provide US$70 million in 2009 to boost 
international reserves and support the country’s external position. ADB, WB, and EC provided 
budget support to Tajikistan in the amount of US$72.5 million in 2009. ADB’s Development 
Policy Support Programs and TA projects support policy reforms related to, among others, 
customs modernization, revenue administration, macroeconomic management, and public 
expenditure issues. The Bank also coordinates closely with the IMF on policy advice and 
technical assistance related to macro-economic management, tax administration reforms and 
other structural reforms.  

Result 2:  Maintain access to critical public services

7.
ADB, EC, and the WB have provided budget support to assist the government in 
protecting public spending in the social sectors (education, health, and social protection) to 
protect recent gains in poverty reduction and social development achieved during the past decade 
of strong growth. This effort is also reinforced by ongoing investment activities by several 
donors. In the education sector, since 2006, all donors support the government through the 
National Strategy for Education Development (NSED) for 2006-2015 and its subsequent action 
plan. The FTI Catalytic Fund is providing support to the General Education Reforms through a 
US$ 18.4 million trust fund implemented by the Ministry of Education (MoE), administered by 
the World Bank and co-led by the WB and UNICEF. Key donor agencies (ADB, GTZ, KfW, 
UNICEF, USAID and WB) support a variety of interventions (loans and grants): management 
(data collection, including policy analysis, costing, planning and M&E), efficiency, access, 
quality, gender parity, and infrastructure. A Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) 
linking the NSED to the budget and the Education Management Information System (EFMIS) 
were introduced. Per capita financing in general education will be scaled up countrywide in 
2010. Joint FTI review became a good example of good donor coordination supporting the 
implementation of the NSED and taking pilot initiatives into a broader scale. FTI provides a 
basis for future SWAp by bringing donors around the government strategy, moving from the use 
of the project systems to the country structure, and building capacity inside those structures.  

8.
In the health sector, several development partners including SIDA, SDC, WB, USAID 
and KfW actively support the government in strengthening primary health care services, reform 
of the health financing system, fighting tuberculosis and malaria, improving maternal and child 
health and strengthening family medicine. Additional key partners (WHO and the USAID-
funded ZdravPlus Project) are working on health financing reform. A broader group, which also 
includes UNICEF and ADB, has been active as participants in policy dialogue around 
implementation of the Basic Benefit Package and per capita financing in the health sector. The 

115 

 
 
Aga Khan Foundation also plays an active role in supporting primary health care and health 
financing reform. The EC is supporting health information management and the elaboration of a 
MTEF and, together with DFID and other partners, supports the development of a health sector 
strategy. ADB and SIDA are planning to phase out their engagement in the health sector in 2009 
and 2010, respectively. Efforts are being made to improve development partner coordination and 
aid effectiveness in the sector. In 2008, health sector coordination has been evolving from a 
development partner driven process with an information sharing output only, to a sector 
coordination led by the Ministry of Health with the technical assistance supported by WHO and 
the active collaboration of other development partners. Today the dialogue between the Ministry 
of Health and development partners is more oriented toward joint planning and implementation 
of the key health sector reforms.  

Result 3: Reduce risk for vulnerable groups through enhanced social protection 

9.
Vulnerable groups are at risk during the crisis. Reduced remittances and economic 
growth have led to a decline in their disposable income, and therefore increase risk to food 
security, especially in the rural areas. Further, the social system is too weak to provide adequate 
protection to the poor.  In the areas of food security, there are several donors working together to 
provide food to vulnerable groups. UN organizations including UNICEF, FAO, and WFP are the 
main donors. IDA and EC are now working together to rehabilitate agricultural infrastructure 
(irrigation and drainage systems) in the region to generate employments and income for the 
population in time of crisis. In the area of Social Protection, EC has a long-standing engagement 
with the government supporting measures to improve efficiency of the Social Assistance System. 
Recently, the WB is becoming engaged in this area working closely with EC. 

Strategic Objective II: Pave the way for post-crisis recovery and sustained development 

Result 4: Strengthen the business enabling environment 
(2007(cid:486)2009) period. Aside from partnerships on specific operations, the State Investment 
10.
Given the broad coverage of the CPS Results Area of Reducing Administrative Barriers 
to Doing Business this area has a large confluence of ODA programs. The July 2008 Private and 
Financial Sector Review, conducted by the World Bank, mapped 53 initiatives focused on PSD, 
36 of which are currently under implementation, representing US$64.7 million for the 
Council coordinates at the policy level with all the active players in this area through the 
Business Enabling Environment working group, facilitated by IFC with the financial support of 
DFID and SECO. The EC, GTZ, OSCE, MSDSP, ADB, SECO and USAID have trade 
facilitation and other trade-related assistance that support the country’s overall investment 
climate and competitiveness. Other partners, such as the ACTED, AKDN, CARITAS, DFID, 
EBRD, EU, GTZ, OSCE, SECO, SIDA, UNDP and USAID, support activities that indirectly 
address productivity, livelihood and competitiveness through various entry points such as 
support for agricultural productivity, youth employability, sustainable livelihoods, community 
enterprises, and other interventions mostly at the grassroots level. Private sector development has 
been one of the cross-cutting issues extensively discussed at the DCC. The joint Private Sector 
Development Strategy, developed with the government by the WB, identifies the key issues 
requiring donor support in the PSD area in the coming years. 

116 

 
 
11.
In the financial sector, donors currently involved in the area of regulatory reform include 
ADB, USAID and the WB, while virtually all donors active in the financial sector (ADB, EBRD, 
GTZ, IFC, KfW, USAID, and SECO) have contributed to advance microfinance in Tajikistan 
through various types of projects. The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) has 
provided support to the WBG through IFC’s South Tajikistan Cotton Lending Project, which has 
increased private bank lending to the critical agricultural sector, and SECO supported IFC's 
Azerbaijan and Central Asia Leasing Project, which led to strong growth in Tajikistan's leasing 
sector. 

Result 5: Improve conditions for a sustainable increase in agricultural productivity  

12.
In agriculture, key donor agencies include the multilaterals (the WB, EC, the Islamic 
Development Bank (IsDB), UNDP, and FAO), bilateral donors (USAID, GTZ, SDC, DFID, 
SIDA, and NGOs), and the Aga Khan Foundation (see Agriculture Sector Review). SIDA, ECA 
and ADB have expressed their intention to disengage from this sector in the future. ADB and the 
WB are currently the two largest donors in the cotton sector, with commitments of US$120 and 
US$55 million, respectively. There is no comprehensive agricultural sector policy or strategy 
agreed on by the government and other key stakeholders to serve as a coordination tool. 
However, mechanisms to facilitate better cooperation and coordination are only now emerging 
with the Donor Coordination Council (DCC) Agricultural Sub-group, which was created in late 
2007, and the three joint DCC-Government Working Groups on land reform/irrigation, finance 
and debt resolution, and the informal Legal Aid Center Coordination Group. Two DFID funded 
long-term consultants are also assisting in donor coordination. Additionally, donors are working 
towards consolidating PIUs in the sector. For example, the WB and ADB have a joint PIU for 
the sector.   

13.
Only a few partners have specific programs on Disaster Risk Management -- UN, EC. 
However, the development community, with actors such as FAO, WFP and UNICEF, is prompt 
to bring an emergency response to crises (the devastating rains in May 2009 and the food crisis 
in 2008). Yet disaster preparedness and contingency planning are areas that are currently not 
being fully supported by the donor community. The WB, through its ongoing avian flu project, is 
providing some support. 

Result 6: Improve the reliability of electricity and gas and increase energy export 
potential

14.
IFI/Donor interest in the energy sector has been limited and is mainly providing support 
for rehabilitation of existing systems and improving efficiency under the Energy Loss Reduction 
Project (WB/Swiss SECO), Pamir Private Power Project (WB/IFC/Swiss SECO/AKFED), 
Energy Emergency Recovery Assistance Project (WB), and Energy Rehabilitation (ADB)). The 
development partners active in the sector have been ADB, IsDB, KfW, Kuwait Fund for Arabic 
Economic Development, Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs and the WB, in addition to 
the newcomers Iran, China (PRC) and the Russian Federation. ADB and WB have been 
particularly involved in regional energy trade. ADB, with commitments of about US$60 million 
in the energy sector, along with KfW (US$40 million) are the most active donors with activities 
ranging from power distribution in urban areas to regional energy trade initiatives. Currently, 
there is no formal development partner coordination mechanism in the energy sector. A 

117 

 
 
centralized Project Management Unit (PMU) reporting to the President’s Office has been 
established to manage energy sector projects, except those financed by the WB that are 
implemented by Barki Tojik and Tajik Gas. The WB’s activities mainly focused on policy 
dialogue (e.g., corporatization of the energy utilities, energy tariff adjustment program) as well 
as specific investments targeted at commercial loss reduction (e.g., Energy Loss Reduction 
Project) and operations efficiency enhancements (e.g., Energy Emergency Recovery Assistance 
Project). It had prepared an energy sector development policy advisory note for the government 
that sets the directions for the development of energy sector on a two-track basis: (i) 
strengthening of the domestic energy sector through tariff adjustments to cost viability levels, 
energy loss reduction program implementation, improvement of financial management systems 
and corporate governance, and (ii) export orientation of new hydro/thermal energy projects. The 
government, with the help of its international consortium of advisors led by Taylor-DeJongh, is 
preparing a comprehensive two-pronged strategy that would encompass both short-term and 
medium-to-long term sets of measures. 

Result 7:  Improve the provision of safe water in Dushanbe and selected 
municipalities

15.
SDC/SECO has been the main actors in the sector among the IFIs and bilateral agencies. 
Their involvement include: (i) a regional rural water supply project and improvement of 
community-based water supply systems in the south Muminobad rayon; (ii) support to “UNDP 
rural water supply dialogue” to bring together key governmental institutions, donors and 
organizations working in the field of drinking water; and (iii) grant co-financing to Khujand 
water supply improvement project; and (iv) co-financing of a new EBRD-financed rural water 
supply project (through its Khujand water supply project, phase 1 and 2; and a new project for 
Kulyab, Dangara and Kurgan Tube, scheduled for approval in 2009). JICA supports the 
reconstruction of rural water supply systems in Khamadoni rayon of Khatlon oblast; regular 
training of sector professionals in Japan; and Master Plan and Feasibility study of sustainable 
supply of drinking water to South districts of Khatlon region, including proposal for feasibility 
study for reconstruction of Vakhsh trunk main). The WB currently finances the Dushanbe water 
supply and the Municipal Infrastructure Development project (includes water supply and 
sanitation components in 8 regional cities). There is currently no formal development partner 
coordination mechanism in the water supply and sanitation sector. The Water Supply and 
Sanitation Sector Strategy Workshop, conducted by the Government of the Republic of 
Tajikistan in April 2009 was the first initiative in the country to focus attention of both the 
Government and the donor community on Tajik water supply and sanitation, and, in particular, 
on the priorities, included in the Tajikistan water supply and sanitation sector note, prepared by 
the government with financing by the World Bank; and to bring together the government and the 
donor community. To strengthen donor coordination similar workshops will be conducted on an 
annual basis during the CPS period. 

Result 8: Strengthen the quality of public services to enhance human capital 
potential

16.
Donor activities in the education and health sectors have contributed to two results under 
both strategic objectives: reducing the negative impact of the crisis, and paving the way to 
sustained post-crisis recovery. Their activities contributed to improvements in the quality of 

118 

 
 
education and health services, thus enhancing the human capital potential that is required to 
support economic growth. Compared to efforts to strengthen basic and secondary education (see 
strategic outcome 12), Vocational and Technical Education (VTE) has received comparatively 
marginal attention. Currently, the only existing coordinating tool of the government is the Labor 
Market and Migration Policy, which is being finalized. The WB’s Life Skills Development for 
Future Migrants project (financed by Russia) will provide training to Tajik migrants on basic life 
skills to improve Russian language skills and knowledge of that country’s laws and procedures. 

Result 9: Strengthen incentives for better performance of civil servants 

17.
Improving the Performance of Public Sector is another area where multiple partners are 
engaged, and the forms of engagement include technical assistance for local planning and 
expenditure management, local government financing, and budget reforms at the provincial and 
municipal levels. Active development partners here include ADB, Sweden, UK, UN, and the 
USA. ADB has a program loan and technical assistance for local government financing and 
budget reforms. Most assistance is directed through sector support. However, the Public Sector 
Reform Project supports the implementation of reforms envisaged by the Public Administration 
Reform Strategy (2006) in the areas of restructuring of state agencies, reform of civil service 
administration, pay reform, and strengthening strategic policy coordination.  

Result 10: Improve transparency and accountability in public financial 
management

18.
On Improving Transparency and Accountability in Public Financial Management, the 
EC and the WB are leading the efforts working closely with other partners. There are many 
active development partners but all resources are aligned with the priorities identified in the 
Public Financial Management Strategy for 2009-2018 and the Public Financial Management 
Project. The WB’s Public Finance Management Project (US$5 million) is co-financed by DFID 
and the EC (US$5.5 million). Additional financing in the amount US$0.97 million comes from a 
PHRD Grant for project preparation. The Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs expressed 
willingness to participate in financing PFM reforms in close coordination with the WB, the EC 
and DFID through a Swiss Trust Fund. 

B.

Implementing the Paris Declaration in the 2009-2013 CPS 

19.
Tajikistan has signed the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness on ownership, 
harmonization, alignment, results and mutual accountability. The government is committed to 
the Paris Declaration and the subsequent 2008 Accra Agenda for Action and its implementation. 

20.
Although donor coordination mechanisms are present in many sectors of intervention of 
the new CPS (as described in the previous section), a recent study on aid effectiveness in 
Tajikistan concluded that there is scope for better use of aid resources. Overall, the findings 
suggest that improving coordination, both in terms of planning, joint implementation, monitoring 
and evaluation, would bring benefits. Currently, development partner fragmentation in many 
sectors creates considerable coordination challenges and costs for the government. Some aid 
remains supply driven and the lack of predictability creates problems for government planning.  

119 

 
 
21.
The CPS will benefit from a strong coordination mechanism through a JCPS supported 
by an important number of donors36 that is currently being completed and formulates “the
principles and mechanisms that will guide the delivery of aid to Tajikistan, the cooperation 
between the Government of Tajikistan and the development partners, and the coordination 
mechanism to be used to implement the commitments of the Paris Declaration as expressed in 
the core principles.” Box 1 outlines a shared list of principles of aid effectiveness. 

Box 1: Draft Shared Principles of Aid Effectiveness 
to Assure Ownership, Harmonization, Alignment, Results and Mutual Accountability 

4.

1. Tajik authorities will take the lead in coordinating donor assistance in support of and aligned with the priorities of the 
NDS and PRS, and clarifying key points of contact between donors and the overall Government structure.   
2. Donors will provide support to enhance Government’s capacity for coordination and will provide timely information 
on their budgets and activities to allow effective government planning, monitoring and reporting on aid projects, 
programs and flows. 
3. Tajik authorities, with the support of donors, will link the annual national budget, public investment program and aid-
supported programs in an integrated programming process for greater realism, relevance and consistency. 
In specific sectors Donors will work with Government towards a sector-wide approach of:  one strategy, one 
coordination point and one M&E framework, including : (i) agreeing on sector strategies endorsed by Government; 
(ii) moving towards clearer division of labor, and (iii) joint monitoring and evaluation of sector programs. 
5. Donors will work towards ensuring that Technical Assistance is demand-driven and responds to national needs 
6. Donors will focus on scaling-up successful project interventions for policy development and nation-wide outcomes 
where appropriate and feasible. Scaled up programs will be designed for sustainability and with clear linkages to 
policy-based and results-based budgeting 
7. Government and donors will not only monitor outputs over a 12-month period but measure outcomes within the 
medium-term framework of the JCPS, and the MTEF where it exists 
8. Donors will develop common arrangements for planning, funding, disbursement, monitoring, evaluating and 
reporting on donor activities and aid flows. They will promote joint missions, diagnostic reviews and training 
activities. 
9. Tajik authorities and donors will work together to integrate project preparation and implementation management fully 
into the ministerial structures and processes and reduce the number of project implementation units by creating joint 
units responsible for multiple projects. 
10. Donors will seek to provide predictable, multi-year programmatic financial support and support Government’s efforts 
to improve fiduciary systems to increase the flow of funds directly into the budget 
11. Tajik authorities and donors will jointly consult with a wide range of stakeholders (including Parliament, local 
government and communities, academic institutions, civil society, the diplomatic and aid community) in planning, 
implementing, monitoring and evaluating  donor supported programs 
12. Donors agree to hold themselves to greater self accountability to monitor if aid coordination is meeting national goals 
and objectives (through Paris Declaration and IDA indicators) 
13. Donors will support the Government to ensure its greater accountability and transparency to the citizens of Tajikistan

Country Level Policy Dialogue

22.
The DCC was established in early 2006. Among others, its objectives are to (i) promote 
country ownership through joint dialogue, (ii) enhance harmonization through promoting joint 
activities and ultimately, sector wide approaches (SWAp), (iii) secure future alignment through 
supporting country systems reforms, (iv) facilitate networking and broader collaboration within 
the donor community, and (v) align country strategies of the donors through a single country 

36 The JCPS is being developed with the combined support of ADB, EC, Sweden (SIDA), SDC, DFID, WB and the 
UN and include the Government of Tajikistan represented by the Chairman of the State Investment and Property 
Management Committee. 

120 

 
 
 
                                                 
 
operational strategy. The DCC meets biweekly with an annually rotating chairmanship, currently 
chaired by DFID. To facilitate the process, a core DCC group, comprising members representing 
the WB, ADB, SIDA, DFID and SDC/Seco, has been set up.  

23.
The DCC has had good dialogue with the government on PRSP2 development and has 
proven to be an efficient mechanism in coordinating donor activities. It has also been involved in 
various sector issues, such as cotton debt and land reform initiatives. Donor coordination is well 
advanced at the national level through Monitoring and Evaluation of PRSP (joint ADB-EC-
DFID mission) and at the sector level in education, health, and energy. The JCPS is identifying 
good practices behind the success of this donor coordination (e.g., systematic Chairmanship by 
Government representatives), and hoping that coordination in other sectors will benefit from 
these practices.  

24.
One of the lessons learned from the first PRSP pointed to the need for a single 
government counterpart or agency responsible for coordinating with donors. The State 
Committee on Investments and Public Property is now assuming this function. It is in charge not 
only of the dialogue with the donors on issues related to monitoring and evaluation of the 
implementation of the Paris Declaration, but also to perform a coordinating role in this field 
within the government. The Aid Coordination Unit remains the focal point on information 
management related to donor assistance. 

2.

Developing Country Systems

25.
Procurement. The latest Tajikistan CPAR was prepared in 2003. It recommended the 
gradual decentralization of public procurement to procuring entities. With technical assistance 
and financial support from the Bank, the necessary conditions conducive to transparent, 
economic, and efficient public procurement in the country were created. A comprehensive public 
procurement law (PPL) that is consistent with international standards was adopted in March 
2006. Subsequently, implementation regulations and Standard Bidding Documents (prepared in 
Russian language and translated into Tajik and English) according to the new law were 
developed with the support from the Bank; they were approved and registered with the Ministry 
of Justice in January 2008. The capacity of the Procurement Agency was strengthened: five staff 
were trained as trainers in designing and delivering training to public officials at all levels of 
government in conducting procurement according to the law.   

26.
Efforts by the government to improve transparency in procurement bidding include 
organization of the public procurement workshops and initial procurement training for procuring 
entities and different levels of public officials; publication and dissemination of new PPL, 
introduction of implementation regulations and SBDs; and raising awareness of the procuring 
entities on the provisions of public procurement law. In June 2007 the government established 
the Qualification Committee to give the status of qualified procurement entity. At the moment 7 
agencies have received such a status. To speed up further implementation of the new PPL and 
decentralize the procurement responsibility, the PA will prepare the national training strategy for 
public procurement, covering all the levels of administration and implement and deliver the 
training programs. It appears, however, that the PA’s own funds are not enough for sustaining 
and further developing the public procurement system reform program; there is certainly a need 
for more funding to complete the decentralization of the procurement responsibility. The World 

121 

 
 
Bank IDF grant to the TJ Public Procurement Agency was closed in FY08. It will assess the 
financial and technical assistance needs for the Public Procurement Agency during the CPS 
period.  

27.
Financial Management. A Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) for 
Tajikistan 2003 concluded that the country’s fiduciary environment is extremely weak and the 
risk to public funds is high. The findings, supported by PEFA of 2007, point out that systems of 
public accountability function poorly and public sector transparency is still a problem at all 
levels of government.  Most project implementing entities use the cash basis of accounting, 
which in most cases is sufficient for proper accounting of project resources and expenditures. 

28.
Internal and External Control. The internal audit function has been established within 
the Ministry of Finance (Internal Control & Audit Department), and carries out inspections in 
budget organizations, mainly to ensure compliance with laws and regulations. The internal audit 
function is still weak and focuses on regularity in individual transactions rather than on systemic 
issues and on effectiveness with which public resources are used. The EU has been working with 
the government to develop a strategy for improving internal control and audit. External audit is 
practiced by the Agency for Financial Control and Anti Corruption (formerly State Financial 
Control Committee), the equivalent of a Supreme Audit Institution (SAI). However, this 
agency’s capacity is weak and its conduct of audit is not reliable. As a result, audits of IDA 
portfolio have been performed by private audit firms pre-qualified by the Bank and contracted by 
the Committee for Investments. It conducts a block audit of WB financed projects in Tajikistan. 

29.
To minimize financial risk, there has been a need to “ring fence” financial resources in 
Bank projects in order to provide the appropriate fiduciary safeguards. Most Bank-financed 
projects in Tajikistan are implemented through stand-alone project implementing agencies that 
install parallel accounting systems to those used in the respective line ministries. The project 
implementing entities use the cash basis of accounting, which is not in accordance with IFRS, 
but is allowed under IPSAS, and in many cases sufficient for proper project accounting. A small 
number of projects are implemented by borrower/recipient agencies, which are required to 
follow WB financial management procedures rather than the country’s financial management 
systems. 

30.
Based on assessments of the country PFM system, only some elements of the country FM 
systems are planned to be used under the project. These include budgeting and treasury system 
for payments in local currency. Full use of the country PFM systems for project implementation 
will be considered, as the government progresses with the implementation of the PFM reforms, 
some of which are included under the PFMM. 

31.
The strength of safeguards systems have not yet formally been assessed by the Donor’s 
community. 

122 

 
 
3.

Effective and Inclusive Partnerships for Development

32.
The Tajikistan regular Consultative Group (CG) and Development Forums have served 
as an effective mechanism for facilitating substantive policy dialogue on the country’s 
development agenda. However, representation still needs to be broadened to include 
representatives from civil society, academia, private sector and the legislature.   

33.
Aside from the bi-annual PDF event, working group meetings are held around thematic 
areas - MDGs and social progress; growth and investment climate; economic and fiscal reforms; 
governance and anticorruption; decentralization and local government; sustainable rural 
development throughout the year to follow through on issues and agreements reached and 
facilitate consultations across a broad range of stakeholders. Each working group is typically 
convened by the head of the relevant government agency and a development partner as co-
convener. Key initiatives and achievements of the Working Groups are discussed in the section 
on development aid programs in the context of the CPS. 

4. Mutual Accountability and Managing for Results

34.
Specific modalities for joint operational engagement by donors can increase effectiveness 
and reduce the costs of implementation for the government and donors. A good example of this 
type of synergy comes from the joint WB-ADB portfolio reviews that have been alleviating the 
weight on government implementing and oversight agencies. 

35.
The recent Aid Effectiveness Study suggests there are high transaction costs for aid in the 
country, particularly given capacity constraints. In an effort to address this imbalance, and 
maximize the impact of the aid available, the government and donors jointly reviewed current 
overall coordination mechanisms and concluded that a number of improvements need to be 
made. This included greater use of sector working groups, joint missions and diagnostic reviews, 
as well as developing common arrangements for planning, funding, disbursement, monitoring, 
evaluating and reporting on donor activities and aid flows. Currently, donors are considering 
joint project implementation units in the context of SWAps in the health and education sectors,37 
but much work remains to be done to ensure the conditions are right for success. Before this 
approach can be effective, JCPS partners agree that certain prerequisites need to be in place to 
achieve sustainable results, including:  (i) a strong prioritized country-led sector strategy; (ii) 
strong country systems for absorbing resources (fiduciary and procurement); (iii) sector 
strategies that is rationalized, fully costed and linked to a medium-term budget expenditure 
framework; and (iv) improved aid harmonization, particularly for monitoring and information 
systems. The overall objective is to put in place sustainable mechanisms that will lower the cost 
of aid and improve donor effectiveness.    

37  A SWAp is an approach to support a country-led program for a coherent sector in a comprehensive and 
coordinated manner. It is characterized by: (i) country-owned sector policies and strategies; (ii) a sustained, country-
led partnership among development partners and key stakeholders; (iii) a common program and an expenditure 
framework (usually a medium-term framework and an annual budget) based on agreed priorities and strategies; (iv) 
a financing plan that aligns government’s and external resources under the common program; and (v) significant 
movement toward common approaches in planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation with increasing 
reliance on country’s systems and procedures.
