EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

This World Bank Group Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Albania covers the period FY 1 1- 
FY14 and is the first CPS to be presented to the Board following Albania’s graduation from IDA in mid- 
2008. The CPS is fully aligned with Albania’s National Strategy for Development and Integration 
(NSDI), which was prepared by Government following a broad participatory process involving 
stakeholders throughout the country. The CPS program also takes into account the lessons learned 
through implementation of the last country strategy, the findings of Bank analytical work and other 
donor’s’ activities. 

Albania has been a development success story in many respects. Over the past two decades the 
country has made enormous strides in establishing a credible multi-party democracy and market economy 
and it is rapidly re-integrating into the international and European communities. In addition, over the past 
decade, Albania has been one of the fastest-growing countries in Europe, enjoying average annual real 
growth rates of 6 percent, accompanied by rapid reductions in poverty. Poverty fell by half (to about 12.4 
percent) between 2002 and 2008, while extreme poverty now affects under 2 percent of the population. 
In addition, the country has made solid progress towards achievement of the Millennium Development 
Goals (MDGs), although social indicators still lag significantly behind the EUlO and Croatia. 

Albania is one of a very few countries in Europe which was able to maintain positive - albeit 
significantly reduced - growth rates and financial stability in 2009, despite the global financial and 
economic crisis. Thus far, the impact of the crisis has been transmitted mainly through lower remittances 
and trade. A substantial fiscal expansion in 2008 and 2009 also helped cushion the impact of the crisis, 
but needs to be unwound quickly. Given the slower recovery in Europe, Albania’s growth prospects 
could be less favorable than in the past. The key challenges going forward are the following: (i) early 
resumption of fiscal consolidation and strengthened public expenditure management; (ii) regulatory and 
institutional reforms to boost competitiveness and investment; (iii) improvements in education levels and 
skills to meet the demand from businesses; (iv) reduction of infrastructure deficits in a fiscally sustainable 
way; and (v) improvements in the effectiveness of social protection systems and key health services to 
avert new vulnerability risks that could arise as a result of the slow recovery. In addition, given that 
Albania is very vulnerable to climate change (due to high dependence on water for power and irrigation 
for the economically-important agriculture sector) it is vital that the country moves rapidly to 
appropriately adapt its water infrastructure and usage to changing climatic conditions. 

The joint Bank Group CPS program will help Albania to meet the above challenges, by focusing 
on three strategic objectives as follows: 
Supporting a recovery in Albania’s growth rates through improved competitiveness, by 
strengthening macroeconomic and public expenditure management, improving the 
business climate, affordably addressing infrastructure bottlenecks, and deepening access 
to credit 
Broadening and sustaining social gains by improving education and health services and 
establishing an adequate safety net 
Reducing vulnerability to climate change by improving water conservation and 
management and increasing disaster preparedness 

Under this CPS, a “one- WBG” approach aims at a more focused, synergistic program, with 
coordinated IBRD-IFC engagements in the following priority sectors: (i) national infrastructure - energy 
and roads; (ii) municipal infrastructure, mainly water supply and solid waste management; and (iii) the 
business environment. Moreover, the CPS program reflects a deepening sub-regional fo cu s in the 
Western Balkans and South-East Europe especially in energy, tradekransport and disaster management. 

1 

The CPS program will also continue to support governance improvements in Albania through 
use of a “governance filter” for all Bank-financed operations in order to promote management, efficiency 
and transparency improvements across government ministries. 

A main focus of the Bank’s effort under this CPS will be to focus on improving the 
implementation of the large ongoing portfolio of Bank-financed operations in Albania (which are fully 
relevant to the developmental challenges described above). New projects will be added very selectively, 
and only in a small number of crucial areas. The focus on the existing portfolio is needed in order to 
deliver the expected development impacts while improving the pace of resource transfer to the 
Government as it faces new fiscal constraints. A key goal will be to further integrate Bank-financed 
operations into Government’s budget and administrative framework to realize across-the-board gains in 
public expenditure management and transparency. The strategy of lending for fewer, larger projects both 
responds to Government’s explicit request in this regard as well as allows for the completion of the 
consolidation of the investment portfolio to 10-12 operations by FY 14 (from 21 projects in FY04). This 
in turn, will free up Bank internal resources for more analytical and advisory work with Government on 
Albania’s emerging challenges. 

New IBRD lending to Albania over the CPS period is expected to amount to about $275 million 
while IFC expects to increase itsfinancing for the private sector to a level of $120-150 million. Of the 
total IBRD lending, which will be contingent on IBRD’s financial capacity, jus t over 35 percent (or $100 
million) could be provided in the form of quick-disbursing policy-based budget support, assuming a 
satisfactory macroeconomic framework. Annual budget support would likely be on the order of $25 
million, initially for a social sector policy reform operation and subsequently for a series of three DPLs 
focused on growth and investment. Remaining new IBRD support will be provided in the form of about 8 
investment operations for social sectors, natural resource management, infrastructure, and public sector 
reform. 
IFC’s investments will be channeled through direct financing in key sectors including 
agribusiness, energy and social sectors. Financial sector investments will strengthen banks’ capitalization 
(where needed) and provide long-term financing for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), 
renewable energy and energy efficiency products. IFC will also use its advisory services to secure private 
financing through PPPs for road maintenance, water supply, solid waste management and renewable 
energy. 

Implementation of the CPS is subject to fou r main risks. First, delays in effecting a f i s c a l 
adjustment or a deepening of the crisis in the Eurozone could compromise macroeconomic stability 
thus affecting the planned budget support program. To accommodate these risks, the CPS program has 
been designed to be flexible -- enabling a reduction in quick-disbursing lending in the case of continued 
fiscal expansion or, conversely, a substantial increase in budget support if Albania is hit hard by external 
shocks despite sound macroeconomic policies. Second, the polarizedpolitical climate in Albania could 
lead to policy and/or institutional gridlock. While it is difficult to fully address this risk, it is hoped that 
the consensus between the parties on the European Union (EU) accession agenda will help achieve 
progress. Third, given that new IBRD lending is relatively small and increasingly selective, it is possible 
that the Bank’s ability to influence sectoral reforms through policy dialogue and institutional 
development could be reduced - especially as concessional financing from the EU becomes more readily 
available. This, however, need not necessarily affect results on the ground as the Bank Group will 
continue to provide analytical and advisory services to help Albania meet its development challenges. 
Moreover, the Bank will continue to partner closely with the EU on many programs of relevance to 
Albania’s development. Finally, portfolio performance could be affected by ongoing constraints in 
Government’s implementation capacity, though these are being addressed through capacity building and 
consolidation of the Bank program.

I. INTRODUCTION 

1 . 
This World Bank Group Country Partnership Strategy f o r Albania covers the period F Y l l - 
FY14 and is the f i r s t CPS to be presented following Albania’s graduation f r om IDA in mid-2008. The 
last World Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy for Albania wa s approved on January 10, 2006 and 
covered the period FY06-09. Implementation o f the strategy was assessed through a CAS Progress Report 
(CASPR) presented t o the Board in May 2008, and through a comprehensive CAS Completion Report 
(CASCR) attached in Annex 2. The lessons identified in the CASCR, country priorities a s laid out in the 
Government’s National Strategy for Development and Integration, analytical work undertaken by the 
Bank and the activities o f other external partners were critical in shaping this strategy for FY 1 1 - 14. 
2. 
Albania enters the new CPS period having weathered the global financial and economic crisis 
reasonably well - maintaining positive, albeit significantly reduced, growth rates in 2009 and a sound 
banking sector. The impact has mainly been felt through remittances and trade, while the fiscal 
expansion that helped t o cushion the impact o f the crisis, needs to be unwound quickly. Given the 
uncertain prospects in Europe and difficulties in Greece - a major economic partner for trade, investment 
and remittances - the next few years are likely to be much less favorable. The key challenges to 
improving Albania’s growth prospects in this environment include: (i) the early resumption of a sound 
medium term fiscal framework and further strengthening o f public expenditure management; (ii) 
improving implementation o f Albania’s already broad program o f regulatory reforms t o boost 
competitiveness and investment levels; (iii) continuing to close the infrastructure gap in a fiscally 
sustainable manner; (iv) deepening the private sector access to credit. Meanwhile, the slow recovery is 
likely to take its toll on the most vulnerable necessitating a renewed attention to improving the 
effectiveness o f social protection systems and accelerating progress on social indicators. Finally, Albania 
is rapidly coming to terms with its climate change challenge - a s the second most vulnerable country in 
Europe and Central Asia - primarily relating t o the management o f its water resources on which the 
country is heavily dependent for energy and agriculture. 

3 . 
The jo in t Bank Group program presented in this CPS focu se s on the implementation of a large 
ongoing program in Albania that i s already supporting the abovementioned challenges, while 
selectively introducing new IBRD lending of around $2 75 million, and increasing IFC financing f o r 
the private sector to a level of $120-$150 million. O f the total IBRD lending, which is conditional on 
IBRD’s financial capacity, ju s t over 35 percent (or $100 million) could be provided in the form o f quick- 
disbursing, policy-based budget support - assuming satisfactory macroeconomic framework - with the 
remainder devoted t o investment operations for the social sectors, basic infrastructure, natural resource 
management and public sector reform. The new activities are fully spelled out for the first two years o f 
the CPS but only indicative descriptions are included for the outer years, in order to retain flexibility to 
adapt the program to emerging circumstances. IFC will also mobilize other funds especially for private 
participation in infrastructure through its advisory services. This jo in t strategy will continue the tradition 
o f strong collaboration between IFC and IBRD, particularly in the water, transport and energy sectors. It 
will also build on the deepening sub-regional focus in the Western Balkans and South Eastern Europe in 
key sectors such a s electricity, trade and transport and disaster mitigation and management.

11. COUNTRY CONTEXT 

A. 

Country Background 
4. 
With a population of about 3.2 million, Albania is situated in the Western Balkans and enjoys 
a favorable geographic location in South-East Europe and valuable natural resources. Not only is the 
country close to much larger economies (Greece, Italy) - which are important as trading partners, hosts of 
Albanian migrants and sources of investment - its natural resources include significant hydropower 
potential, large swathes of fertile agricultural land, over 360 kilometers of Mediterranean coastline with 
excellent tourism and transport potential, and valuable mining deposits. 

5. 
Albania has come a long way in establishing a multi-party parliamentary democracy since the 
fa l l of the communist dictatorship in 1991, although the political environment continues to be affected 
by a high degree of political polarization. Political stability has increased with a gradually improving 
conduct of successive national and local elections (the latest in 2009) with associated non-violent - albeit 
sometimes rancorous- hand-overs of power between the two dominant parties: the center-right 
Democratic Party (DP) led by Prime Minister Sali Berisha and the Socialist Party (SP) now led by Tirana 
mayor Edi Rama. The governing coalition currently in power is led by the DP for its second term 
together with a small left-leaning party, the Socialist Movement for Integration. The legitimacy of the 
constitutional system is well accepted, and despite recurrent controversies over electoral results, parties’ 
efforts to gamer votes act as a key determinant of their platforms. Nonetheless, the political environment 
is very polarized, often to the detriment of constructive debate and policy stability. 

6. 
Albania has made important strides in re-integrating into the international and European 
communities after decades of isolation, and has been an important contributor to regional stability in 
the Balkans. The country became a member of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 2008 and 
formally applied for EU candidate status in 2009, after ratification of its Stabilization and Association 
Agreement, originally signed in 2006. In April 2010, Albanian authorities submitted the responses to the 
pre-questionnaire necessary to prepare an assessment of the country’s readiness to fulfill EU membership 
obligations. Within the Balkan region, Albania has promoted regional stability and collaboration 
wherever possible, while remaining a strong supporter of Kosovo independence. Successive Albanian 
governments have consciously and systematically avoided the notion of a “greater Albania” among ethnic 
Albanians across the region, and have maintained strong ties with all of its regional neighbors. 

7 . 
Albania has also seen rapid economic growth and major social change over the past decade. 
Once labeled as the continent’s poorest country, Albania has been one of the fastest-growing economies 
in Europe, enjoying annual real economic growth rates of around 6 percent over the last decade. Today, 
with a GDP per capita of US$3,836, Albania is a lower middle-income country, and graduated from IDA 
lending in mid-2008. The country has also experienced rapid social change, including internal migration 
from rural to urban areas and mass emigration of economically active citizens who are a source of 
substantial remittances (ranging from 11-14% of GDP annually). 

8. 
The rapid growth in GDP has been accompanied by an equally impressive decline in poverty. 
Nearly half of Albania’s poor had been lifted out of poverty between 2002 and 2008. The poverty head- 
count fell from 25.4 percent in 2002 to 12.4 percent by 2008 and extreme poverty is very low at under 2 
percent. Besides rapid growth, significant increases in public and private wages and pensions have been 
contributors to this reduction in poverty. Poverty reduction was initially more pronounced in rural areas 
(29.6 percent in 2002), but the decline in rural poverty has accelerated substantially in the last 5 or so 
years and is now approaching urban rates (14.6 percent in 2008). Nonetheless, there are areas of the 
country - mostly the mountain areas -- where poverty remains high (29.8 percent), contributing to 

2 

9 . 

increasing income inequality. In addition, in the rural areas, female-headed households have experienced 
only a one-third the rate o f poverty reduction a s male-headed households. 
Albania is well on its way to achieving most of the MDGs, but remains an outlier among its 
European neighbors on most health and education indicators. Albania’s position on the Human 
Development Index has improved steadily to a rank o f 70 in 2009, in line with Western Balkans’ 
rankings, but significantly behind the rankings o f the EUlO countries and Croatia. There have been 
notable improvements in some o f Albania’s social indicators. For instance, enrollments in all levels of 
education (early childhood, primary, secondary and tertiary) have increased. Similarly, infant mortality 
fell from 15.1 per 1,000 live births in 2004 t o 10.3 by 2009. However, a s Table 2 below shows, Albania 
still has significant challenges t o converge with regional standards in the area of secondary enrollment, 
child and maternal mortality rates, and in access to safe drinking water.

Despite the strong record of growth, poverty reduction and social welfare achieved thus f a r , 
Albania fa c e s a number of important challenges going forward, especially in the wake of the global 
financial and economic crisis. The recovery to sustained economic growth while maintaining poverty 
reduction trends will require concerted efforts to increase investment and raise labor productivity (growth 
has been largely jobless to date and based on productivity improvements from the reallocation of 
resources across sectors). Albania will need t o raise its competitiveness a s an investment location within 
Europe by addressing key bottlenecks in the business environment, and by raising the skills base in the 
labor market. In addition, given the uncertain prospects in its external environment and the likely toll on 
the poor and vulnerable, Albania should also move to accelerate reforms aimed a t improving the 
effectiveness and efficiency of its social protections services.

First, on the macroeconomic management front, there will be a need t o correct the recent 
fiscal expansion and establish a more sustainable fiscal framework for the medium term. To 
underpin this framework, the authorities should also accelerate improvements in public 

3 

expenditure management, notably: (i) raising the efficiency of social spending, (ii) careful 
pacing of needed public investments in infiastructure; (iii) improving disbursement of 
Albania’s substantial - but increasingly less concessional - donor financing; and (iv) a 
concerted effort to attract more private financing for infrastructure and social services, over 
time.

Second, securing robust improvements in the business environment is crucial not only for 
increasing Albania’s competitiveness, but also for making progress on its EU integration 
agenda. Albania has undertaken a broad program of regulatory reforms, but implementation 
continues to lag substantially behind new laws and regulations. This lag contributes to a high 
level of uncertainty in the business environment (in turn, possibly exacerbated by ongoing 
political polarization) that significantly lowers returns to private investment in Albania. 

In order to maintain the rapid poverty reduction trends, even in the more difficult 
environment, Albania will also need to broaden its social gains to date. Reforms in education 
are needed to broaden access, particularly at secondary and higher levels, and to improve 
quality at all levels to bring Albania’s skills base more into line with its European neighbors 
so that it can compete for jobs. Meanwhile health indicators remain comparatively low, 
particularly for women, and the effectiveness of social programs to reach the remaining 
vulnerable groups needs improvement. 

B. 

Recent Developments 

(i) Political Developments 

11. 
One year after the most recent Parliamentary elections in June 2009, the Albanian political 
environment remains marked by tense relations between the opposition and the coalition Government. 
The Democratic Party finished ahead of the Socialists by only about 1 percentage point in the June 
elections, but secured a majority in Parliament thanks to support from the Socialist Movement for 
Integration (a smaller left-leaning party). The Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights 
(ODIHR) of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) certified the elections as 
better than previous ones, although still with some shortcomings. After the elections, the SP refused to 
take its seats in Parliament, demanding a partial recount. However, its appeal to the courts was rejected. 
Meanwhile, the DP has expressed its full support of the original Electoral College decision not to sanction 
a recount. In this context, the President and the international community mediated a compromise in 
which SP parliamentarians took their seats in Parliament just ahead of a February 2010 constitutional 
deadline. However, a two day marathon session in Parliament failed to bring the parties to an agreement, 
and the SP has since abstained from parliamentary sessions. In early May 2010, the SP organized a series 
of public peaceful protests and a 19-day hunger strike demanding a recount. Recent pressure from the 
European parliament, in the context of the ongoing candidacy process, has brought the parties together to 
negotiate a resolution and has already facilitated a resumption of the opposition’s participation in 
Parliament. 

12. 
Public opinion polls suggest that the prospect of EU membership (and, more immediately, the 
prospect of visa liberalization with the EU) is a widely-held aspiration of the Albanian electorate and 
provides powerjul motivation f o r many political and economic actors. EU integration is a central 
element in the platforms of both major parties, while, several European actors have reiterated that the 
efficient functioning of democratic institutions, including Parliament, remains an essential political 
criterion in the ongoing candidacy process. As such, the EU integration processes are expected to 
continue providing an important and credible anchor for Albania’s political development over time. That 

4 

said, there remains a not-insignificant risk that continued political tension in Albania may intermittently 
impact development progress and the accession anchor, a s well. 

(ii) Economic developments 

13. 
Albania has had a successful record of sustained growth over the last ten years, averaging 6 
percent p e r yea r , while maintaining stable inflation, interest and exchange rates (Figures 1 and 2). 
Growth has been the result o f major structural transformation, based largely on the movement of labor 
from low productivity agricultural occupations to services and construction, and, to a lesser extent, to 
manufacturing. The high rates of economic growth have not been matched by rapid increases in 
employment. Indeed, employment remained stagnant in all years except 2008 which saw only a marginal 
improvement. Still, Albania avoided excessively high open unemployment due to massive emigration of 
skilled and unskilled workers, particularly to Italy and Greece. The inflow o f remittances from migrants 
has fluctuated between 11 and 14% percent of GDP, annually, and has been an important source of 
demand while also helping to achieve the rapid declines in poverty cited above.

14. 
For most of the last decade, growth has been underpinned by a stable macro-economic 
framework, in turn the result of sound f i sca l and monetary policies. From 2002 to 2007, a gradual 
fiscal consolidation based on improving revenue administration contributed to a downward trend in the 
overall deficit and a decline in public debt from 62 to 53 percent of GDP between 2003 and 2007. In 
addition to low and stable inflation, Albania’s flexible exchange rate system has proved to be a good 
shock absorber. In this environment, the financial system saw a rapid expansion of private credit from 4.2 
percent of GDP in 2000 to 37.4 percent at the end of 2009. 

15. 
However, Albania met the global financial and economic crisis in a period o f f i s ca l expansion. 
In 2008, Albania embarked on a path of fiscal expansion through a rapid increase in government 
investment (from 5.8 percent o f GDP in 2007 to 8.7 percent in 2008, associated mainly with one large 
road project) and subsequent increases in public sector wages and pensions, which elevated total spending 
to 33.7 percent of GDP in 2009 from 29.2 percent in 2007. Combined with relatively limited exposure to 
international markets and comparatively low levels of credit to GDP, the result was that Albania was one 
of the few countries in Europe that experienced positive growth rates in 2009, albeit at a much slower 3 
percent. 

5 

16. 
The Government’s delay in adjusting spending plans throughout 2009 resulted in deteriorating 
macroeconomic indicators. By 2009, the fiscal deficit had risen to 7 percent of GDP (of which, 4.6 
percent was financed through new borrowing and 2.4 percent was covered through privatization 
proceeds). Meanwhile the gradual impact of the global crisis materialized with remittances falling from 
13.5 percent of GDP in 2007 to 10.7 in 2009, and a significant slowdown in exports. The increasing 
current account deficit, which reached 15.2 percent in 2009, was financed by exceptional privatization- 
related Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and expensive public sector external borrowing - the 
Government contracted two syndicated loans (of around half a billion Euros) in 2008 and 2009. As a 
result, public debt also rose - t o 59.6 percent of GDP from 53.7 percent in 2007. 

17. 
The banking sector has withstood the crisis reasonably well. Albania’s banking sector was one 
of the few in the region with a large positive net foreign assets position, especially compared with other 
countries in the region. This was related to prudent bank management as well as limited credit lines of 
foreign banks for Albania, which in turn meant very limited private external debt. Moreover, active 
supervision by the central bank helped to avoid contagion, despite the fact that Albania’s banking sector 
is dominated by foreign banks from around the region. After an early sharp drop in late 2008/early 2009, 
bank deposits have since recovered to pre-crisis levels at the beginning of 2010. Meanwhile, non- 
performing loans rose slightly, but the situation remains manageable. Levels of provisions at 6 percent of 
the loan portfolio and capital adequacy ratios of about 16 percent of total assets remain at comfortable 
levels and should be able to absorb further negative shocks.

18. 
Growth prospects in the coming years are less favorable - external conditions are tougher and 
Albania needs to f ind new sources of productivity growth. Albania faces a tough external environment 
with tighter capital and investment markets, a deteriorating situation in one o f its main economic partners 
(Greece) and the likelihood o f a much slower recovery in Europe. Graduation from IDA ha s been 
accompanied by several other development partners also moving t o less concessional financing. 
In 
addition, the country?s past productivity growth has been based on the reallocation of labor from 
agriculture t o other sectors, on demand driven by earnings o f external migrants, and the impact o f 
regulatory reforms aimed at improving the business climate. Both these sources are likely to become less 
important over the medium term. Under these conditions, Albania can expect to grow at a slower pace 
over the short-to-medium term. Growth in 2010 is likely to be only marginally higher than in 2009, with 
a projected slow recovery from 201 1 depending on the outturns in Europe a s a whole. 

19. 
Albania will need a renewed focus on maintaining the conditions f o r economic growth and 
poverty reduction by reducing current macro-fiscal risks, raising the returns to investment, and 
improving labor productiviQ. 
Re-establishing its tradition o f sound macro-fiscal policy in an 
environment o f tighter external financing and an uncertain European economy will require more cautious 
budgeting over the next few years. A careful pacing o f domestically financed public investments over the 
medium term a s well improvements in the efficiency o f large social expenditures are also key. 
In 
addition, Albania will need to dramatically improve its competitiveness a s an investment location in 
Europe, by following through on business environment reforms. In particular, Albania needs to close a 
persistent gap between its steady stream o f regulatory reforms and their subsequent implementation, and 
to reduce the uncertainties stemming from cumbersome administrative procedures, corruption, weak rule 
o f law, and lack o f secure property rights. Finally, Albania needs to accelerate reforms in the education 
sector to increase access, quality and relevance to its labor market needs. 

111. THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM A ND SECTORAL CHALLENGES 
A. The National Strategy for Development and Integration 

20. 
In 2007, Albania approved the National Strategy f o r Development and Integration for 2007- 
2013, which was developed via a participatory process involving stakeholders throughout the country. 
The NSDI aims to (i) integrate the country into the EU and NATO ; (ii) develop and consolidate the 
democratic state, notably through electoral, judicial and property rights reform; and (iii) achieve rapid, 
balanced and sustainable economic, human and social development. The NSDI has established target 
growth rates of 6-7 percent and aims to reduce the poverty headcount t o below 10 percent by 2013. The 
NSDI states that macroeconomic stability is to be supported by fiscal consolidation and reduction o f debt. 
Infrastructure investments would concentrate on roads and transport, energy, and water supply and 
sanitation. In the social services, the Government aims t o increase secondary education enrolment to 76 
percent, introduce a basic package of covered health benefits, strengthen the coverage of the social 
assistance, and reform the public pension system. Moreover, following the 2009 Parliamentary elections, 
the Government reiterated the focus on water sector (including both water supply and sanitation, but also 
on irrigation t o improve agricultural productivity) and the health sector a s areas where resources would be 
concentrated in the next 2-4 years. 

B. 

Improving Macro Management, Budget Processes and Public Expenditure Management 

2 1. 
Given the recent fiscal expansion, Albania needs to return to the more prudent fmcal policy 
that served the economy very well between 2002 and 2007. Sound macro-economic management 
(especially a prudent fiscal stance, flexible exchange rates and sound monetary policy) was fundamental 

7 

to the rapid expansion of the economy over most of the past decade. However, the sharp increase in the 
overall deficit (and reduction in public saving) in 2009, resulting in a level of debt nearing 60 percent of 
GDP have raised concerns about the fiscal framework, particularly in the absence of a new IMF program 
to provide an anchor for fiscal policy since the successful completion of the last program in 2008. Given 
the uncertainties in Europe and the capital markets, Albania needs to move quickly to withdraw the recent 
stimulus, consolidate its fiscal position, increase public saving and begin to reverse recent increases in 
public debt. 
It should be noted that Albania, with Bank support, has made important strides in 
strengthening its institutional capacities for debt management, in time for its graduation from IDA and its 
entry into the international capital markets (see Box 1). Notwithstanding this, given the fiscal trends over 
the past few years, a revised fiscal framework would be well-served by some type of anchor mechanism, 
such as a fiscal rule, consistent with long term debt sustainability, to increase the confidence of the 
financial markets and investors that Albania has resumed its strong macroeconomic record of the past. 
Without the anchor of a credible fiscal policy Albania would be at the risk of higher financing costs and 
uncertain availability of finance, which may increase macroeconomic volatility. 

2 2 . 
Albania should also continue to further strengthen its expenditure management systems, as the 
underpinning f o r both its fiscal policy and the effective implementation of the NSDI. Albania has made 
significant progress in putting in place the institutional framework for sound budgeting, most recently 
with the passage of the new Organic Budget Law which enshrines, inter alia, medium term budget 
practices that have been followed for some years, and with new procedures for public investment 
planning. However, this needs to be complemented by: (i) stronger enforcement of the new rules and 
procedures; (ii) more transparency and fewer reallocations at the budget execution stage, to preserve the 
integrity of the annual and medium term budgeting processes; and (iii) more ex-post monitoring and 
analysis to reinforce incentives for improving the quality of medium term budget plans. Completion of 
the long-delayed Treasury system (currently underway) and the subsequent development of a modern 
integrated financial management information system would allow not only to strengthen day-to-day 
management of expenditures, but also to link spending with NSDI objectives and program outcomes, and 
improve monitoring of development programs, as a whole. Similarly, Albania has also made some strides 
improving its fiduciary systems. It continues to receive support from a number of development partners, 
not least the Bank and the European Union, on completing the reforms of public procurement and on 
deepening improvements in financial management. 

2 3 . 
Building confidence in Albania’s macroeconomic management will also require an 
improvement in the production of national statistics, in particular, national and fiscal accounts. 
Albania has had a longstanding need to strengthen its macroeconomic statistics and has been receiving a 
range of donor support for this purpose but the assistance has been very small and relatively 
uncoordinated. National accounts and labor and employment statistics are notably the weakest areas, and 
require urgent attention given their importance as key signals to economic actors in a modern market 

8 

economy. More urgently, however, there is also a critical need to adhere to a fixed calendar for the timely 
release of all macroeconomic data. The global financial crisis saw a tendency in many countries towards 
a hands-on management of the production and release of key national statistics. The current crisis in 
Greece demonstrates the risks of not having accurate, transparent and timely economic data. Reinforcing 
the capacity and independence of the National Statistical Agency to produce robust and unbiased statistics 
would also help to further underpin both the soundness and credibility of macroeconomic policy in 
Albania. 

C. 

Strengthening the Framework for Private Investment 

24. 
In recent years, Albania has taken important steps to upgrade the regulatory framework f o r 
business. The Government has been implementing a comprehensive reform program to establish an 
efficient, sustainable and transparent regulatory system, with the goal of increasing investment levels, 
enhancing competition and stimulating business growth. These efforts are reflected in the improving 
Doing Business indicators and ranking: Albania moved from 136* in 2007 to 82nd in 2010. 
Its 
performance on the Global Competitiveness Index and on the Heritage Foundation?s Index of Economic 
Freedom has also improved significantly in the recent years. However, the overall rankings mask 
considerable variation in rankings for individual indicators. For example, the country?s Doing Business 
rankings ranged from 15? for protection of minority shareholder rights, to 91st on enforcing contracts, to 
173rd on getting construction permits, the Index of Economic Freedom includes rather low scores for 
protection of property rights and freedom from corruption. In addition, the business environment remains 
more difficult for women who are poorly represented in ownership of firms, compared to other countries 
in ECA. 

25. 
A significant gap remains between officially-adopted regulatory policies and 
their 
implementation and enforcement, explained in pa r t by the still-weak rule of law. The enforcement gap 
significantly reduces the high returns to private investment in Albania, deterring both foreign and local 
investors and imposing costly time and bribe ?taxes?, thus eroding some benefits of regulatory reform. 
Analysis of recent firm surveys (2007-08) demonstrates that firms? productivity, propensity to export and 
their employment creation are hampered by lack of the predictability over enforcement of rules, and the 
time taken to comply with regulations. Meanwhile, Albania continues to see its lowest rankings among 
the World Governance Indicators ? (WGI) on control of corruption and rule of law, which are the only 
areas in which it is on par with an below the average level for lower middle income countries, 
respectively. 

26. 
Albania?s investment climate i s also substantially undermined by unclear property rights and 
weaknesses in land administration. A survey conducted in 2008 as part of the Investment Climate 
Assessment (ICA) found that insecure property rights and access to land were considered to be severe 
obstacles to investment by a large majority of firms, with small- and medium-sized firms 
disproportionately affected. Moreover, anecdotal evidence suggests that foreign investors are often 
deterred from investing in Albania due to difficulties in obtaining access to land or premises with clear 
legal title. Exacerbating the uncertainty surrounding property rights is the apparent inability of the courts 
to successfully resolve disputes and/or to enforce decisions taken through judicial processes. The 
Government is well aware of the issues surrounding property rights and their implications for private 
investment and has adopted some appropriate policy responses. Implementation has lagged, however, 
due to a highly variable legal framework, coordination failures, capacity constraints and corruption. 

? WGI indicators also include voice and accountability, political s tab i l iv , government Qec t iveness and regulatory 
quality on which Albania ha s improved significantly over the last decade. 

9 

27. 
In addition, Albania faces a significant challenge with respect to supporting private businesses 
in the adoption of the more sophisticated technologies that are needed in order to meet new EU 
standards and regulations. While the authorities make progress on introducing new EU regulations and 
standards, there is a need not only to improve their implementation from the public sector side, but also to 
create an environment which allows private firms to acquire the necessary technical know-how to comply 
with these requirements. Albania?s exporters remain concentrated in the bottom end of the global market, 
mainly comprising unskilled processing with limited value added. A limited number of programs are 
underway financed both by Government and development partners to raise the capacity on both sides to 
implement new regulations, in particular in agriculture sector. However, these need to be complemented 
by attention to the systemic constraints that hinder the usual changes for knowledge adoption and 
innovation, for example, linkages with foreign direct investment, promotion of within firm worker 
training and an effective quality and standards infrastructure. 

D. 

Closing the Infrastructure Gap 

20. 
Increasing the availability of good quality infrastructure is another critical element of the 
Government?s efforts to enhance the climate f o r private investment and growth and ensure wider 
inclusion. Indeed, firms interviewed for the Bank?s competitiveness assessment under the ICA identified 
infrastructure bottlenecks - electricity supply, telecommunications and transport (including logistics) - as 
the greatest obstacles to growth and investment. 

29. 
The unreliability andpoor quality of electricity supplies has regularly been cited by Albanian 
firms of all sizes as one of their most critical constraints. In 2008, firms reported an average 32 outages 
per month, necessitating widespread reliance on stand-by generators and inhibiting expenditures on 
sophisticated technical equipment which might be damaged by power fluctuations. Aware of the 
seriousness of this situation, the Government, in close cooperation with the Bank Group, has embarked on 
a major reform of the power sector beginning in 2008, but much remains to be done. The government 
began restructuring the power sector: the state-owned electricity company, Albanian Electroenergetic 
Corporation (KESH), was unbundled and the retail distribution and supply business was privatized. 
Under the new electricity tariff framework, the privatized OSSh is required to meet performance targets 
for: (i) reducing transmission and distribution losses; (ii) increasing collection rates; (iii) improving 
operational efficiency; and (iv) improving the quality of electricity. The sector has already begun to see 
substantial improvements, in part because of management reform but also because of better hydrological 
conditions, strengthening of the regulatory entity, and privatization of the retail supply. The next three 
years will be especially critical in making the new structure and market model fully effective. First, the 
financial, managerial and technical viability of the publicly owned energy companies in the supply chain 
need to be strengthened and their associated inter-company arrears reduced. Second, there is a need to 
make the recent privatization of the distribution sector effective through, inter alia, new investments to 
reduce energy losses in distribution. Third, the Government will need to further increase generation 
capacity, especially through small but efficient hydro projects. Finally, the sector?s contingent liabilities 
to the Government will need to be substantially reduced. 

3 0. 

Albania?s telecommunications infrastructure had been perceived as an obstacle to doing 
business but Government passed a telecommunications framework law in 2007 which is helping to 
create a competitive market. In the past, significant numbers of Albanian firms have reported that 
inadequate and costly telecommunications services are an obstacle to doing business (BEEPS 2005 and 
2008). In response to these issues, the Government passed a new law in 2007 which has already led to 
significant improvements including the entrance of a third mobile service provider in the market. As a 
result there has been a notable a rise in the number of users of telecom services, significantly lower costs 
and better quality of services. 
Further improvements will involve continued effective implementation 
of the new law including at least four elements in the short to medium term: (i) appropriate regulations

regarding interconnection; (ii) number portability; (iii) fostering inter-market competition; and (iv) 
competitive allocation of 3G and WiMax frequencies. 

3 1. 
Albania has been steadily improving its transport infrastructure, but there is a substantial way 
to g o before the road network reaches the average standard f o r lower middle income countries and 
there is a need f o r much greater emphasis on maintenance. The overall length o f the road network in 
Albania totals about 14,500 km. The recent focus has been on development o f the network and there have 
been some investments in short and discontinuous sections o f expressway (including Tirana - Durres, 
Rreshen - Kalimash) - but the standard o f the primary network remains inadequate. Meanwhile, the 
local road network (about 4,411 km) is also in very poor condition with only 3 9 percent paved. The 
recent establishment o f a large Secondary and Tertiary Roads program, which aims t o reconstruct and 
rehabilitate 1700 km o f local roads, should make a significant improvement. A t this stage, the key 
priorities for the road sector are to : (i) develop the connectivity o f the network and bring it to a uniform 
standard that is comparable with other countries in the region; (ii) remove the maintenance backlog; (iii) 
provide sustainable management and financing systems; and (iv) continue institutional reform and 
capacity strengthening to improve sector institutions, such a s the nascent Albanian Road Authority. In 
parallel, the country should also improve infrastructure and service delivery improvements, in the port 
and rail sub-sectors, through private sector involvement, EU alignment programs and regional initiatives. 

32. 
Irrigation infrastructure is vital to tapping the agricultural sector’s comparative advantage but 
remains in poor condition and needs to be adapted to changing climatic conditions. While Albania has 
significant annual rainfall, less than 20 percent occurs in the six-month period from April to September. 
making irrigation necessary for summer and perennial crops. Drainage and flood protection is also 
important to agriculture, particularly in the low-lying coastal plains. Even after a decade or so of 
investment in rehabilitating the extensive irrigation and drainage system (a legacy o f communism), about 
one third o f the system still remains t o be rehabilitated, and upstream dams and water sources need 
attention. Meanwhile the institutional structures for the operation and maintenance are still weak - 
Albania is still searching for sustainable and effective mechanisms for managing irrigation and drainage 
systems that can better meet the changing needs o f Albania’s agricultural sector. The Government has 
recently made further improvement o f the irrigation system, including the use of more modern methods 
such a s drip irrigation, a major priority in order to raise productivity in the agriculture sector. 

E. 

Broadening and Sustaining Social Gains 

33 . 
Albania has been comparatively less successful in extending the benefits of its growing market 
economy to the broader population. Growth, to date, has been largely jobless with only marginal 
increases in employment. The impact of growth on poverty reduction has been achieved mainly through 
sectoral reallocations o f employment, migrant remittances to their families, a s well increases in public 
sector wages and pensions. In addition, social indicators in health and education, and in the coverage and 
adequacy o f social protection systems, lag significantly behind averages o f the EUlO and Albania’s 
regional neighbors. The slow economic recovery is likely to take its toll on the most vulnerable 
necessitating a renewed attention to improve the effectiveness o f social protection systems. However, the 
pattern of vulnerability is likely to be gender-biased, a s women face greater challenges than men in the 
labor market. 

34 . 
In education, the key challenge faced by the Government of Albania is to improve quality at all 
levels while also improving access, particularly f o r secondary and higher education as well as f o r 
rural households and minorities. This will require raising low secondary enrolment rates for boys and 
girls (Albania has no gender significant differences in secondary enrolment, see Table 1 on page 3), 
reducing large urban-rural disparities, and ensuring that students are better prepared to respond to labor 
market demands. Albanians have, on average, fewer years o f schooling when compared t o EU and sub- 

11 

regional averages, and few students continue into higher education. There are also vulnerable groups 
with particularly low enrolments, even in basic education. Quality, as measured by standardized tests, 
also indicates serious challenges. To address these challenges, the Government has developed a National 
Education Strategy (NES) for 2004-20 15 (covering pre-university education) which emphasizes quality 
improvements as a way to encourage higher enrolment. The authorities have also launched a separate 
strategy for higher education which focuses on improved governance and, financing mechanisms in the 
public universities. 

3 5 . 
To date, the Government has made good progress in implementing its National Education 
Strategy, but will need to persist in and accelerate reforms in order to achieve educational outcomes 
comparable to EUlO and Croatia. By the end of 2009, one-fourth of all teachers had received some 
continuing education, student-computer ratios have declined from 6 1 to 2 5 ; and school overcrowding is 
being addressed with only 18 percent of students attending multiple-shift schools versus 3 6 percent just 
three years earlier. In terms of promoting accountability at the school level, all school principals have 
been trained in management and education leadership and 90 percent of pre-university level schools 
report having a functioning board but de facto responsibility for processes/procedures remains to be 
transferred. At the higher education level, reforms have also taken place, albeit at a slower pace. The 
higher education law was revised and is currently being implemented. All universities have established 
an external governing board and about 70 percent of the universities have developed strategic plans. The 
Government is currently carrying out discussions on curriculum reform and developing an action plan to 
implement the Bologna process. In addition, consideration is being given to the development of incentive 
schemes to attract students and provide resources in areas where skills are lacking. 
3 6 . 
Albania continues to lag behind other countries in the region as well as other lower middle 
income countries worldwide with respect to health outcomes. Health care also remains a critical area in 
which individual households are affected by corruption, with close to a third of survey respondents 
reporting that they have paid a bribe to receive medical attention. Public expenditure on health remains 
low (2.7 percent of GDP), but total spending on health care from both public and private sources is 
comparable with other lower middle income countries, at about 6 . 5 percent of GDP. Out-of-pocket 
payments currently account for nearly 60 percent of total funding, and the high level of informal 
payments leads to serious inequality in access to health care with the poor often foregoing necessary care. 

3 7 . 
Reforms initiated to improve health care service delivery and financing have not been fu l ly 
implemented and serious problems remain with respect to: ( i ) regional imbalances and unequal access; 
(ii) payment s y s t em that are unsuited to promoting cost containment or efficient resource use; and 
(iii) weak sector management capabilities. The Government has been committed to undertaking reforms 
in several areas. Most recently, it launched a broad program to rehabilitate primary care facilities. A 
system for continuous medical education and re-licensing of medical staff is being implemented; and the 
Ministry of Health has developed clinical practice guidelines for most common diseases which is being 
rolled out to primary health care (PHC) providers. In addition, the Government has undertaken initial 
steps towards improving resource allocation mechanisms through development of a national 
rationalization plan for hospital services. In addition, the Government has begun improving the resource 
allocation mechanism from the existing input-based to performance-based by changing the provider 
payment systems. Achieving the fu l l impact of these reforms is likely to take several years and will 
involve changes in the behavior and incentives of both patients and providers. 

3 8 . 
Albania’s rapid development has seen dramatic reductions in poverty rates, but there are 
emerging poverty traps which need to be addressed and vulnerable groups (especially labor-scarce 
households) which require Government support. The country has been slowly reforming its safety nets 
into modern, well-targeted and effective social assistance programs. Making progress on these is 
becoming increasingly important in terms of fiscal management, because of the large share of these 

12 

expenditures in the budget and recent expansionary trends, for example, ballooning disability fund 
expenditures. Th e pension system also has significant long-term fiscal deficits and low coverage. 

39. 
There are significant opportunities to improve targeting and administration of the Albania’s 
main social benefits program, Ndihma Ekonomike (NE). The poorest beneficiaries receive only 56 
percent of NE transfers, and the benefits amount t o only about 14 percent of the beneficiaries’ total pre- 
transfer consumption. There are significant opportunities t o improve targeting mechanisms, reduce 
discretion and opportunities for abuse. Administrative processes also remain overly cumbersome with the 
transaction costs for applicants inflated by numerous documentation requirements which administrators 
must cross check with multiple agencies at different levels o f public administration. The introduction of 
national registry and electronic data bases would significant increase the efficiency of targeting and 
administration, and help to reduce system costs. The Government has made improved administration o f 
social benefits a s one of its highest priorities and have already prepared a draft law to introduce targeting 
and administrative reforms in NE. 
4 0 . 
Spending on non-contributory disability benefits is disproportionate to the estimated number of 
disabled people. Disability benefits account for more than half o f the total social assistance spending. 
During 2000-2008, both the number o f disability beneficiaries and the level o f average disability benefits 
increased significantly. An initial diagnostic of the disability program shows that the disability legislation 
is scattered, medical eligibility criteria are outdated, and the system in place for assessing disability cases 
is open to conflict o f interests. Finally, it should be noted that the operational level disconnect among the 
institutions that manage different parts o f social protection leads to missed opportunities for improved 
effectiveness from linking these services. 

41. 
Finally) Albania’s pension system is not sustainable in the long t e rm A compressed benefit 
structure, though redistributive, provides little incentive for people to contribute and/or declare correct 
earnings. A s a result, a low share o f the working age population is contributing to the pension system in 
Albania but the pension system has to finance several generations of elderly, most o f which have full 
pension rights. In addition, roles of pension and social assistance programs are not clearly demarcated. In 
rural areas, the pension and social assistance branches o f the system have evolved in such a way that rural 
pensions have essentially become a social assistance benefit. Rural pensioners pay contributions based on 
a flat amount, but a large part of their contribution is paid for by the Government. Sporadic 
implementation o f the pension indexation rule leads t o uncertainty. Pension administration is weak, with 
some of the past records still paper-based. The Albanian Government has made reform o f the pension 
system administration one o f its main priorities, but has delayed efforts on the necessary measures owing 
t o the need for a broad-based and multiparty consensus. Meanwhile, efforts are underway to improve 
administration, including the introduction of new archive and information systems. 

F. 

Strengthening Water Resource Management and Adapting to Climate Change 

42. 
Albania i s well endowed with water resources but its environmental infrastructure is lagging 
behind other countries in the region and hydrological institutions are weak. Insufficient understanding 
o f the central role that water resources and the interconnections between various water uses play in the 
economy has contributed to systematic underfunding and weakening o f the institutions in water resources 
management. Albania also shares a number o f its rivers and lakes with neighboring countries, making it 
imperative that effective regional institutions are established to ensure their adequate management. 

43. 
Upstream soil erosion and downstream sedimentation are already of increasing concern, with 
their attendant impact on the quality of coastal waters and Albania’s tourism potential. This erosion 
and sedimentation is evident in abandoned (uncultivated) and arable lands, fo re s t s and pasture lands in 
the coastal area but also along river beds and in river deltas. This i s caused by illegal logging, 

13 

overgrazing and extraction of gravel resources without any regulation. Millions of tons of sediments are 
deposited in rivers and washed away into the Adriatic Sea every year. Forests and water catchments in 
mountainous regions face increasing pressures from erosion, illegal logging, and development, but local 
capacity to manage resources is limited. Lack of critical environmental infrastructure and services in the 
southern coast of Albania also exacerbate the risks of damaging natural resources in light of the expected 
tourism development. 

44. 
The impact of climate change on Albania is expected to be severe, with changing weather and 
waterflow patterns in different parts of the country. Albania is the second most vulnerable country to 
climate change in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, owing to likely increases in the variability of 
precipitation and Albania’s steeper topography and its reliance on water for energy and agriculture. 
Climate change predictions suggest that Albania is becoming hotter and drier, with more frequent 
droughts and extreme rainfalls. 
Increased variability and intensity of rainfall is expected to raise 
uncertainty and economic risk to farmers, water managers, energy producers, manufacturers, transport 
managers and tourism operators. Such hydrological variability also increases risks for natural disasters 
from flooding, erosion and landslides. 

45. 

Recent changes in weather patterns, which are leading to an increased incidence of flooding 
throughout the country and a disastrous f lood in northern Albania in January 2010, have sharpened 
the authorities focus on the more immediate impacts of the changing climate. Albania’s flood 
protection infrastructure was built for much less extreme climate scenarios than have been recently 
experienced, meanwhile the institutional set-up for coordinated management of surface water flows does 
not function effectively. Given the extent of agricultural and urban investments in lowland areas, the 
economic risks of weak preparedness are quite high. In general, Albania’s predictive and response 
capacities for natural disasters, which include earthquakes as well, are limited and fiscal resources are 
strained. Its hydro-meteorological and weather forecasting services lag behind the region and there is no 
existing early warning system. 

46. 
Albania’s high dependence on its water resources -for hydropower production and irrigation 
f o r the important agriculture sector, as well as household uses - makes it imperative to address this 
climate challenge in a comprehensive and integrated manner. Albania’s hydropower dams produce 
90 percent of domestically sourced power, but institutional, monitoring, and infrastructure deficiencies 
leave room for improved efficiency in water use and management. The Government’s ongoing efforts to 
further develop its untapped hydropower potential in both small and large plants will have to be carefully 
considered so as to also preserve water use rights for other purposes. The irrigation sector, by far the 
largest water user, accounting for over 70 percent of all abstractions, has also suffered from insufficient 
funding and an inadequate management framework that have led to the deterioration of infrastructure and 
unreliable water delivery. Many agricultural reservoirs cannot be operated at their full storage level, 
reducing their functionality for flood protection. Erosion in upland areas and sedimentation have reduced 
storage capacities significantly, and farmers are increasingly installing wells without much consideration 
for competing demands on groundwater. Expanding access for municipal water supplies competes with 
the same ground and surface water as irrigation and hydropower, with the added problem of requiring 
strong environmental measures to protect water quality. 

47. 
Albania’s urban water supply sector also remains grossly inefficient, with unaccounted-for 
water at 73 percent while the average city supplies only 12 hours per day of drinking water. Moreover, 
the compliance with established microbiological standards is consistently low. The country has only one 
functional waste water treatment plant - several more are under construction - and environmental 
protection of water sources and coastal waters is sporadic. Ground and surface water which constitutes 
the main source of drinking water is at risk of pollution as a result of the discharge of untreated sewage 
waters into rivers and the sea, and inappropriate dumping of solid waste on river banks. The Government 

14 

has recently decentralized the management of Albania’s 52 municipal water utilities to local governments, 
but still provides significant levels of subsidies to the sector. A number o f experiments have been 
undertaken with private participation without much success to date owing mainly to the small size o f the 
utilities. Having indicated to external donors that this sector should be a major focus of infrastructure 
support going forward, the Government is preparing a large coordinated program of reform, investments 
and capacity building in this sector, with one priority being to make rapid progress toward EU standards. 

48. 
Albania’s challenge will be to move promptly to understand and adapt its infrastructure and 
usage to better manage, conserve and make more efficient use of its water resources. Albania’s large 
water infrastructure pool provides an excellent foundation to address water resources management. 
Some work is already ongoing on the development of better hydrological models for the major rivers and 
trans-boundary lakes, improvements in dam safety, reservoir and hydropower management, on new and 
improved irrigation techniques, and on defining a large investment program to improve municipal water 
supply and sanitation. However, to make best use of its opportunities for adaptation, a multi-sectoral 
effort is required with the attendant coordination across government (central and local) and end users. 
IV. ONGOING PROGRAM AND KEY LESSONS 
The Bank has had an active program in Albania for nearly two decades and a number of lessons 
49. 
have been learned over that period. The lessons have been divided into three main areas: (i) lessons from 
implementation of the current portfolio; (ii) broader lessons derived from a formal review of the last CAS 
for the period FY06-FY09 and the 2010 Client Survey; and (iii) lessons learned from engagement with 
other partners, both external development partners and domestic stakeholders. 

A. The Current Portfolio and Implementation Lessons 

50. 
Commitments under the current portfolio include US$263 million in IBRD/IDA loans and 
credits, US$ l80 million in co-financing loans and credits, and US$35 million of recipient-executed Trust 
Funds (TF), amounting to a consolidated portfolio (under Bank supervision) of around US$480 million of 
investments under implementation’. About 40 percent of this consolidated portfolio is disbursed, with 
approximately equal disbursement ratios for Bank and TF financing. Portfolio performance has 
deteriorated over the last couple of years. At the end of May 20 10, 10 of the 16 operations - including the 
IPS Multi-Donor Trust Fund, which is treated like a project on account of its size - had satisfactory or 
moderately satisfactory implementation performance. Two roads projects are rated highly satisfactory 
given their very rapid disbursement rates and good results to date. The average age of the portfolio is 4.5 
years. The disbursement ratio in FY09 was 2 1 percent, and by end May 20 10 was 15.3 percent for FY 10. 

5 1. 
The main challenges ahead for the portfolio are to: (a) improve the implementation performance 
and disbursement rates, which are still notably lower than the regional and Bank-wide averages; (b) 
achieve a better balance of risks and development returns across the portfolio; and (c) consolidate and 
simpliJL the large portfolio into a more streamlined and manageable program of interventions. 

52. 
The recent decline of implementation performance and disbursement rates can be attributed to 
three main factors. First, the process of mainstreaming project implementation arrangements into line 
ministry structures which was begun at the Government’s request in 2004 and applied rigorously to new 
projects during the last CAS period. This mainstreaming involved a steep learning curve for a number of 
ministries, although benefits become evident after the first years o f implementation. Second, persistent 
fiduciary challenges - both in procurement and financial management - have continued to hamper project 

This portfolio also includes a contingent Partial Risk Guarantee of US$78 million, not counted in the above 
investment numbers. 

15 

implementation. Finally, during the CAS period, the program saw a lengthy suspension of one project 
and several major project restructurings resulting from concerns about implementation of safeguard 
policies. Three of these restructurings are expected to be reflected in upgraded ratings in the next few 
weeks, and another in the next few months.

Both the Bank and Government are committed to continue the process of mainstreaming 
implementation into government structures under the new CPS. Mainstreaming is fully in line with the 
Paris Declaration and sets the stage for enhanced sector-wide approaches for development aid. One key 
lesson from the previous CAS is that the approach to this mainstreaming should not be “one-size fits all” 
nor aim simply for the elimination of external project implementation units (PIUS). Mainstreaming can 
make projects more vulnerable to the high staff turnover levels in government. As such, one way to 
mitigate the effect of individual staff replacements is to build a broad-based awareness about, and 
engagement with, the project across a wider range of ministry personnel. The mainstreaming and 
capacity building agenda should be: (i) carefully planned at project design to take into account the 
specific challenges of the beneficiary ministry administration; (ii) explicitly targeted in project outcomes; 
and (iii) explicitly addressed in the project risk framework for the likely impact on disbursements in early 
years, and for the vulnerability to staff turnover.

54. With respect to the fiduciary aspects of the portfolio, the FY 10 Country Portfolio Fiduciary 
Review (CPFR) noted some progress on both financial management and procurement, and identified a 
series of measures to be undertaken under this CPS. Albania remains a high risk country for 
procurement, a s reflected in the still comparatively high level of bribes reported by firms paid to receive 
public contracts, as share of contract value. The 2008 BEEPS showed a reduction in this indicator from 
6.7 percent to 4.4 percent, while the region averages 1.5 percent. However, the FY 10 CPFR did not find 
any major issues on procurement in Bank projects. The Review attributes this to the heightened 
supervision made possible by Bank decentralization of fiduciary staff, which has been relatively 
successful in helping to mitigate the risks in the portfolio as well as building capacity in government. 
The Report also recommends expanding the use of already acceptable elements of the country system, 
while seeking to strengthen others. For example, the Bank is already supporting an audit of Albania’s e- 
procurement system with a view to certifying it for use by several development partners in the future. In 
the area of financial management, the delayed rollout of the Government’s new treasury system did 
complicate financial management for a few projects that were mandated to use this system during the last 
CAS period. However, the rollout is now fully underway, supported by the IPS Trust Fund, and is 
expected to yield a significant improvement in financial management of the portfolio. 

55. 
Drawing from the lessons from the current CPS and also from the CPFR, the Bank will work 
closely with the Government to implement the Fiduciary Action Plan to mitigate and manage fiduciary 
risks for investment lending problem projects, contract management, audit compliance, and financial 
management and procurement practices by the implementing entities. Maintaining decentralized 
financial management and procurement staff 2s essential to cost efficiently sustain the intensive 
fiduciary supervision of the Albania portfolio, mitigate high procurement risks, and facilitate portfolio 
management closer to the client. 

56. With respect to the balance of portfolio risks and development returns, two key lessons emerged 
f r om the recent Inspection Panel cases. The first is that combination of weak property rights and 
widespread illegal construction in Albania pose important risks for a portfolio that supports both a 
substantial volume of infrastructure investments, and other institutional reforms, such as land use 
planning that attempt to address often highly politicized territorial management issues (see Box 2). With 
respect to infrastructure investments, the Bank has undertaken a close review of the portfolio from the 
perspective of these safeguard risks and is following up on the recommendations for better training of 
staff and client officials on Bank policies and better understanding of local laws and procedures by Bank 
staff. A training program for local staff has already been completed. The Bank has also already prepared 
a review of Albania’s land acquisition policies in order to identify the gaps with Bank policy. This will 
be the basis for a training workshop for government officials in early FY 1 1. The second lesson relates to 
the quality of stakeholder engagement in project design and implementation. A s a result, the Albania 
program has instituted a Country Office Communications Strategy that is revised biennially and includes 
closer supervision o f Operational Communications, greater 
interaction with non-governmental 
stakeholders, and timely responses to complaints and inquiries from the public on Bank-financed 
operations. 

57. With the graduation to IBRLl, both the Government and the Bank agree on the need to 
consolidate the number of smallprojects in the portfolio. Such consolidation will be important to make 
more efficient use of the Bank’s resources and Government managerial capacities, free up needed internal 
resources for more analytical and advisory work with the Government on Albania’s emerging challenges, 
and allow the Bank to selectively focus on the development of larger, coordinated donor programs over 
time. The aim is to continue a reduction in the portfolio from 21 projects in 2004, 15 in 2010, to 10-1 1 
by the end of the new CPS period.

B. 

Lessons from the FY06-FY09 CAS Completion Report and 2010 Client Survey 

5 8 . 
The implementation of the FYO6-09 CAS yielded important lessons in terms of the Bank’s 
effectiveness in supporting Albania’s development process. 
In particular, there are key lessons 
pertaining to the benefits of a close coordination between the Bank and IFC on lending and investment as 
well as on advisory services, the efficacy of maintaining a development policy dialogue notwithstanding 
the macroeconomic performance, lessons on safeguards implementation and on the Bank’s role in 
engendering transparency and consultation. 

Close coordination between the Bank and IFC can yield the right combination for complex 
private sector reforms, as seen in the privatization of the electricity distribution company. 
The cooperation between the IFC and the Bank proved critical in achieving donor community 
consensus on major regulatory issues and in structuring an attractive transaction for the 
private sector. The IBRD partial risk guarantee (PRG), a financial instrument designed to 
help governments mitigate political and regulatory risks, helped to maintain and increase 
investors’ interest in the privatization process. The concessions reforms which the Bank 
supported through policy based lending coupled with IFC’s assistance to drafting the new 
concession law, opened the way to IFC’s advisory services new transactions using the law. 
Also, licensing reform supported under a Bank project with IFC technical leadership and the 
Doing Business innovations supported by the joint Bank-IFC unit were two other important 
areas of successful, close cooperation between the Bank and IFC. 

Important reform and structural progress can be made even without budget support, if 
there is strong ownership by the Government of the underlying reform program. During 
the previous CAS period, the Bank and Government maintained a continuous policy dialogue 
which yielded key structural reforms, notwithstanding the eventual outcome that the DPL 
series was curtailed at only the first operation, because of concerns about the macroeconomic 
framework. 

Safeguards policy implementation need to be prioritized to the same degree as fiduciary 
controls in project preparation and implementation. First, both task teams and the client 

18 

need to have a better command of the policies and how to implement them. Second, staff 
responsible for reviewing safeguard policy frameworks (e.g. Resettlement Policy Framework 
and Environmental Management Plans) needs to have a good understanding of local laws and 
procedures, and their specific inconsistencies or gaps vis a vis Bank policies. Finally, the 
Bank needs to ensure that application of these policies is consistent across projects, sectors 
and countries, by ensuring that social development specialists, country legal teams and 
quality assurance staff have a common understanding of how the policy should be applied in 
different types of cases. 

The Bank has played an important role in engendering transparency and consultation in 
Albania, through its own actions and those related to portfolio implementation. Under the 
previous CAS period, closer Bank supervision of consultations already yielded important, 
albeit subtle, changes in the culture of consultation in the Albanian public service. Second, 
under the Inspection Panel cases, the Bank learned important and very public lessons about 
the need to keep communication lines open with the media and the general public, but also 
about how important it is that all stakeholders - general public, project beneficiaries, civil 
society, Parliament, government - have a deeper understanding of the way the Bank works in 
Albania. Third, civil society continues to look to the Bank and other international partners 
for an independent voice on key development issues. 

59. 
In 2009/10, a client survey about opinion leaders’ views of the World Bank and its work in 
Albania found relatively strong support for the Bank’s role. Two hundred stakeholders - drawn from a 
range of opinion leaders in Albania, including government, civil society, media, private sector, and 
academia -- responded to the survey, a 73 percent response rate. Overall results suggest that stakeholders 
are quite satisfied with the Bank’s work in Albania, their relationships with the Bank, the Bank’s 
relevance in Albania, its alignment with country development priorities, and the effectiveness of Bank 
interventions. Just over half of respondents indicated that the Bank should be more involved in Albania’s 
development strategies, while 44 percent said that the Bank was currently involved at an optimum level. 
The Bank is perceived by respondents to be focused on the areas that respondents consider top priorities. 
Stakeholders are concerned deeply with issues related to law, justice and governance. Survey findings 
suggest that the Bank’s overall strategic focus in Albania (identified by respondents as primarily poverty, 
growth, government effectiveness, and infrastructure) is fairly well aligned with what stakeholders think 
the Bank should be focused on in Albania (growth, property rights, education, governance). With respect 
to areas for improvement the most notable findings included consistent suggestions that: (i) the Bank 
should work more with local government and the private sector; and (ii) the Bank should go much further 
in publicly disclosing the details of its work with Government. 

C. 

Partnerships and Participation 

60. 
Donor partnerships. 
The WBG continues to be the second largest donor to Albania after 
European Commission (EC) in terms of disbursements, with around US$60 million per year (see Annex 
7). This position has allowed the Bank Group to help the Government coordinate donor assistance and 
mobilizing financing for key sector programs, with considerable success. A significant share of the 
commitments in the current Bank portfolio is co-financed with other partners, at a ratio of 0.8 in co- 
financing to each dollar of Bank-financing, i.e. around $215 million in co- or parallel-financing for 
around $260 million in I DM B R D loans and credits. This includes one sector wide approach, the 
Education Excellence and Equity Project which has a ratio of 2.5 for each dollar of Bank financing. 
Notably, the Secondary and Local Roads Project of US$20 million from IDA and $15 million co- 
financing from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Fund has been the 
centerpiece of a program of parallelfinancing for feeder roads reconstruction of around US$430 million. 
The Bank is also managing a US$6 million Multi-Donor Trust Fund for a group of seven donors, and an 

19 

innovative fee-based service arrangement with Albania’s One UN program. Most recently, through the 
use of the Partial Risk Guarantee instrument for the privatization of the distribution company, the Bank 
has already supported private investment commitments for electricity sector at an expected ratio of 
approximately 3.2 for each dollar of the guarantee. IFC has also been successful in mobilizing support 
from among a wide range of development partners for its advisory services and technical assistance. 

61. 
Going forward, the Bank and IFC should continue to explore with the Government innovative 
ways of crowding-in private development financing for key areas, in particular for private participation in 
infrastructure where Albania needs large amount of investments and climate adaptation considering 
country’s high exposure to climate change. The WBG will pursue on these areas while ensuring that 
partnering opportunities and arrangements do not overstretch internal resources for high quality 
preparation and supervision, and have clear synergies with the Bank overall program. Moreover, as the 
EC continues to increase its support to Albania it will be critical to further expand and deepen the Bank’s 
cooperation with the EC and Government to ensure that the Bank’s global knowledge can continue to 
inform Albania’s development efforts. 

62. 
Stakeholder participation. Under the FY06-09 CAS, the Governance Filter, inter alia, 
emphasized the demand side of good governance, particularly mechanisms for advocacy and increased 
citizen involvement to encourage better public service delivery. The participatory approach worked 
particularly well in those projects that supported local services and which engaged beneficiary 
participation in social service delivery, irrigation, community works, forestry, coastal village and 
municipal infrastructure, secondary and local roads. Given this experience, the Bank should consider 
means of further deepening its engagement with non-governmental and civil society groups in the 
implementation of its program in Albania. This will not only help to build awareness around Bank- 
financed programs in Albania and support the rollout of the Bank’s new Access to Information Policy, but 
perhaps demonstrate good practices for the Government in ways of effectively engaging civil society in 
monitoring and evaluating public programs and projects. 

V. THE ALBANIA-BANK GROUP COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM 

A. Drivers of the CPS Program 
63. 
The main driver of the FY l l - 1 4 CPS is the Government’s development strategy as articulated 
in the NSDI and the accompanying External Assistance Orientation Document (EAOD). The latter 
document, prepared by the Government in April 2008, provides development partners guidance on 
focusing assistance in support of the NSDI. Specifically, the EAOD calls for a greater use of 
programmatic approaches in development assistance and an added focus by development partners on 
water, environment, health and property sectors. It identifies a clear role for multilateral lenders and the 
challenges of IDA graduation: 

“Multilateral loans are currently playing a very important role in Albania. This is especially the 
case in the areas that do not traditionally receive EU support, such as health, education and 
social reform, but also in infrastructure and natural resources. The graduation from IDA status 
means that the subsidy element of the loans is now less than 20%. However, multilateral loans 
are extremely important for Albania as the WB and other multilaterals are able to provide 
important expertise to complement their funding and because many of these investments 
provide social returns only in the long term.” 

20 

64 . 
The EAOD identifies key areas in which it encourages partners to maintain or increase 
assistance and others in which it would prefer to work using principally domestic public or private 
resources. 

In this regard, it seeks t o maintain the levels o f external assistance in: (i) public 
administratiodrule of law, but with a stronger focus on justice and public order; (ii) economic 
development reforms “but with a common national approach that reflects EU norms [which] IPA should 
play a role in defining”; (iii) social services where the Document calls for the “World Bank to continue its 
leadership and build on the sector w ide approach (SWAP) that has been started in education”; and (iv) 
infrastructure, but with an increasing share to water supply and sanitation, and associated environmental 
management. In infrastructure, the priorities include “completing the national and rural road networks, 
road safety, energy efficiency, management reform in the water and sanitation at the local level along 
with related investments in physical assets, and building effective environmental institutions.”

The Government has recently also requested the Bank to reorient the fo cu s of Bankfinancing 
towards supporting the fiscal challenges facing Albania over the short to medium term. Specifically, 

the authorities have instructed line ministries that Bank financing should be fully integrated into the 
Government’s medium term budget framework and planned within, rather than in addition to, budget 
ceilings. This request reflects the authorities’ acute awareness that Albania’s graduation to IBRD only 
lending - and the accompanying trend o f other partners to less concessional financing terms - requires 
more careful macro management o f its development financing options. The Ministry o f Finance noted 
explicitly that “IBRD funds received from the WB through CPS a re a t more appropriate terms than those 
found in the financial markets” and that their inclusion within the national budget program would not 
only facilitate better long term integrated planning of Albania’s development expenditures, but also 
encourage other donors in pursuit of this principle of the Paris Declaration. Th e Minister has also called 
on all development partners to focus over the next few years on accelerating th e implementation of 
Albania’s substantial ongoing donor financed program to help ease fiscal constraints while maintaining 
critical investments for long term growth and poverty reduction. 

21 

CPS consultations were held with a broad range of stakeholders - - namely, Parliament 
6 6 . 
including the opposition members, the Bank of Albania, representatives of private sector and civil 
society, donors and as well as government officials. The main feedback from the Parliamentary 
Commission on Economy and Finance was related to the design of conditionality for budget support 
which Commission Members felt should be limited to a few high priority issues. In addition, several 
members suggested that the Bank focus in depth on macroeconomic policy (particularly in the absence of 
a Fund program and local presence) and regularly publish analytic reviews on macroeconomic 
performance. The need for a more focused and consolidated World Bank Group program was another 
theme emphasized by Commission Members, who expressed concerns about the rate of project 
implementation. Donors welcomed the Bank’s continued efforts to partner with other financiers, and 
invited the Bank to join in the EU-European bilateral donors division of labor initiative. They also urged 
the Bank Group to take on a larger role in addressing the informal economy and helping to raise private 
sector capacity. Civil society continued to request that the Bank foster more public debate on 
macroeconomic and broader development issues. In addition, the representatives suggested a more 
cross-sectoral focus in addressing key challenges, e.g. the impact of transport on school enrolment or the 
role of forestry management on mountain area poverty. 

6 7 . 

Integration with the European accession agenda. On April 14 ,2010 the Government submitted 
Albania’s response to the EC pre-accession questionnaire as the next step in the candidacy process. EU- 
related reforms are expected to receive greater attention over the next few years, and the Bank has been 
providing relevant assistance where appropriate. However, the Government has thus far based its 
dialogue with the Bank on the Bank’s competitive and comparative advantages, rather than on harnessing 
Bank expertise in pursuing EU integration-related reforms. However, supporting Albania’s EU agenda is 
expected to become a stronger priority, particularly after the results of the EU pre-accession questionnaire 
are published (likely in early 201 1). The Bank will follow these developments closely and be prepared to 
further engage on important EU reforms, particularly in governance, PFM, and fiduciary matters, as well 
as in the central areas of the CPS program. Meanwhile, project teams will work to ensure that they are 
fully familiar with EU requirements, and integrate them as much as possible into lending activities. 

6 8 . 
Going forward, the ECA region is looking to deepen and broaden its partnership with the 
European Commission. The two institutions are already exploring greater interactions on country sector 
wide programs, but also on regional projects, building on the successful collaboration already seen in the 
Energy Community of South East Europe (ECSEE) and the South East Europe Transport Observatory 
(SEETO). In particular, for the Albania CPS program, the Bank will actively seek out areas for joint 
programming with the Commission, to more effectively support Albania’s progress on the accession path. 

B. 

Overview of Country Partnership Strategy 

69. 
A s noted earlier, Albania enters the new CPS period having weathered the g loba lfkanc ia l and 
economic crisis reasonably well; maintaining positive, albeit significantly reduced, growth rates in 
2009 and a sound banking sector. Given the slower recovery in Europe and difficulties in Greece - a 
major economic partner for trade, investment and remittances - the next few years are likely to be less 
favorable than in the recent past. The key challenges to resuming high growth in this environment 
include: (i) the early resumption of a sound medium term fiscaI framework and further strengthening of 
public expenditure management; (ii) improving the implementation of Albania’s already broad program 
of regulatory reforms to boost competitiveness and investment levels; (iii) continuing to close the 
infrastructure gap in a fiscally sustainable manner, and (iv) deepening the private sector’s access to credit. 
Meanwhile, the slow recovery is likely to take its toll on the most vulnerable necessitating a renewed 
attention to improving the effectiveness of social protection systems and safeguarding progress on social 
indicators. Finally, Albania is rapidly coming to terms with its climate change challenge - as the second 

22 

most vulnerable country in Europe and Central Asia - primarily relating t o the management o f its water 
resources on which the country is heavily dependent for energy and agriculture. 

70. 

The jo in t Bank Group program presented in this CPS will help Albania to meet the 
abovementioned challenges, by focusing on three strategic objectives: 
(0 Accelerating the recovery in Albania’s economic growth through improved competitiveness 

by strengthening macroeconomic and public expenditure management, improving business 
regulations and reducing compliance costs, supporting local banks and competitive local 
companies, and improving key infrastructure services and their financial sustainability. 

(ii) Broadening and sustaining Albania’s social gains by improving access to better quality 

education and health services, and increasing the effectiveness o f its social protection systems 

(iii) Reducing Albania’s vulnerability to climate change, by improving the conservation, 

management and efficient use o f its water resources, and strengthening disaster preparedness. 

71 . 
Th is CPS continues the “one- World Bank Group” approach initiated under Albania previous 
jo in t CAS, and aims at an even more focused, synergistic program. Coordinated IBRD-IFC 

engagements are targeted in the following priority sectors: (i) national infrastructure - energy and roads; 
and (ii) municipal infrastructure, mainly water supply and solid waste management; and (iii) the business 
environment. 

In addition, the CPS program also reflects a deepening sub-regional f o c u s in the Western 

72. 
Balkans and South East Europe. Already Albania has and is benefiting from projects in the regional 
Trade and Transport Facilitation in South East Europe program and the Energy Community o f South East 
Europe. During this CPS period, the Bank expects to expand and further develop the Catastrophe Risk 
Insurance Facility, o f which Albania is a founding member. In addition, Albania will continue to benefit 
from a move towards regional economic and sector work (ESW) a s a means o f utilizing available World 
Bank resources for knowledge generation more efficiently. Key areas in this regard include poverty 
analysis, social policy, transport, water, climate change and financial sector. Going forward, new 
priorities could be added, based on client demand and the amenability o f the topichector to a regional 
rather than a country approach. 

Th e CPS program will also continue to support governance improvements in Albania by 

7 3 . 
refining the Governance Filter (initially developed under the FY06-09 CAS) t o focus on a clear set o f 
requirements for Bank-financed projects aimed at deepening the impact on the public expenditure 
management, administrative efficiency, fiduciary and public disclosure practices across government 
ministries. 

74. 

Th e main approach of the CPS will be to f o c u s on improving and accelerating the 
implementation of the large ongoing portfolio of Bank-financed projects in Albania, which are already 
addressing the country’s key challenges, while selectively adding new projects, in a reduced number of 

critical sectors. This focus on the existing portfolio is needed in order to deliver the expected results and 
development impact, while improving the pace o f resource transfer to the Government a s it faces new 
fiscal constraints. An important part of this first approach will be to further integrate Bank-financed 
programs into the budget and administrative framework o f government so a s to yield added benefits in 
terms of public expenditure management, fiduciary and administrative capacities. 

Th is lending strategy also aims to complete the consolidation of the investment portfolio to 10- 

75. 
12 operations by FYI4 (from 21 projects in FY04). The consolidation strategy reflects a Government’s 
request for the Bank t o focus on fewer, larger projects and t o continue to mobilizing large coordinated 
donor programs in key development areas. The move to consolidate the portfolio also reflects the need 

23 

for a more efficient use o f the Bank’s resources and Government managerial capacities for supporting the 
Albania program, and t o free up needed internal Bank resources for more analytical and advisory work 
with Government on Albania’s emerging challenges. Meanwhile the Bank and IFC will support 
regulatory reform aimed at improve the prospects for raising private sector financing for key 
infrastructure bottlenecks.

Strategic Objectives and Results 

76. 

The objective of the CPS is to support Albania’s development through three strategic objectives 
and continuing the use of a cross-cutting Governance Filter. The strategic objectives include: (i) 
accelerating Albania’s recovery to high growth in a post-crisis Europe; (ii) broadening and sustaining 
Albania’s social gains; (iii) reducing Albania’s vulnerability to climate change. Details on the nature of 
each strategic objective, including principal ongoing and proposed instruments, are described below. 

(i) Sound macroeconomic management and improved public expenditure management 

77. 
The Bank will support Government’s efforts to strengthen its macro - especially fiscal - 
performance and public expenditure management. Bank support would be provided principally through a 
series o f policy-based loans together with a range of ongoing and new analytical and advisory services, 
and followed by a planned Public Sector Reform project in FY 14. The main focus of this support would 
be to help Albania: (a) improve the credibility and contestability of fiscal policy; (b) complete the 
framework for safeguarding financial sector stability; (c) continue improvements in public expenditure 

24 

management and fiduciary performance; and (d) deepen the possibilities for citizen engagement with 
public policy-making. 

78. 
The proposed Social Services (FY 1 1) and Growth (FY 12-FY 14) Development Policy Loans 
(DPL) of $25 million each would address, inter alia, reforms in fiscal policy and public expenditure, 
including improving the efficiency of social expenditures (Social Services DPL) and establishment of a 
fiscal rule or equivalent anchor to entrench prudent fiscal policy (Growth DPLs). 

79. 
Efforts to improve the credibility and contestability of fiscal policy would center around: (a) the 
Bank’s renewed engagement in a transparent and public dialogue on fiscal policy and (b) the deepening of 
the Bank’s involvement in the monitoring and analysis of sectoral expenditure patterns and outcomes as 
part of its project portfolio management. The former would start with the dissemination of the recently 
completed Country Economic Memorandum ( C EM , followed by the Bank publication of quarterly 
economic reviews analyzing macroeconomic developments. These reports would be critical given the 
absence of an IMF program, but even if one were adopted the reports could continue to support more 
detailed debates on public expenditure policy - at both the structural and sectoral levels. The sectoral 
analyses would require the Bank’s macroeconomic and sector teams to undertake some public 
expenditure and institutional analyses as part of project preparation of supervision in key ministries. 
These analyses would support greater integration of Bank-financed projects into the medium-term budget 
planning (MTBP) as well as provide additional analytical basis for the Government’s annual budget 
review process. 

80. 
Efforts to improve public expenditure management systems would be based primarily in the 
ongoing Integrated Planning System Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF), which has already enabled 
Albania to further improve its MTBP processes with links to the national strategy. This grant is also 
supporting: (i) the Treasury systems rollout; (ii) development of an Albania Financial Management 
Information System (AMFIS) to link the monitoring of development outcomes with budget execution; 
and potentially (iii) some capacity building for the Institute of National Statistics, in particular, on the 
production of national accounts. Analytical work to take stock of developments and future needs would 
include a new Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) in FY123 and updates of the 
Report on the Observations of Standards and Codes (ROSCs) on Fiscal Transparency and Data Quality 
Assessment Framework, in conjunction with the IMF. 

81. 
In terms of the governance of public spending, Albania has already made progress in public 
procurement and financial management leading to the use of some national systems by the Bank. 
Additional support will be provided under the ongoing Governance Partnership Facility (GPF) Grant for 
further development of the procurement and financial management systems (see Box 3 , below). The 
rollout of the Treasury systems and AFMIS will play an important role in strengthening capacities for 
improved budget reporting, cash accounting and financial management, meanwhile reforms related to 
internal audit and control are fully supported under the EU Instrument for Pre-Accession program. 

(ii) Improved business regulations and reduced compliance costs for the private sector 

82. 
Albania has taken major steps to upgrade the framework for private investment through a broad 
program of regulatory reform, but significant gaps remain between new regulations and their 
implementation in practice as evidenced by persistently high “time tax” reported in the recent BEEPS and 
ICA. The strategic focus f o r the Bank Group under this CPS will be complete ongoing reforms related 
to land administration and business inspections aimed at reducing the “time tax”, and to pu t in place a 
modern system for better preparation of regulatory reforms prior to their adoption. 

The last PEFA for Albania was prepared in 2006. 

25 

83. 
The ongoing Business Environment Reform and Institutional Strengthening Project (BERIS) is 
supporting the introduction of a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) tool and the reform of Albania’s 
framework for business inspections, while the ongoing Land Administration and Management Project 
(LAMP) is financing the modernization of the Immovable Property Rights Office and the registration of 
75 percent of unregistered urban properties. The main activities are complemented by a Doing Business 
Reform Initiative f o r South East Europe, and by IFC s Tax SimpIlJication Project, Subnational 
Competitiveness Program and Trade Logistics Program. 

84. 
The CPS program will also continue implementation of a range of smaller programs aimed at 
strengthening private sector capacities f o r complying with EU and international requirements. These 
include: 
A planned Regional Program f o r Accounting Reform and Institutional Standards (REPARIS) 
Corporate Reporting Enhancement Project aimed at strengthening the corporate sector 
financial reporting in line with EU and international requirements; and complemented by 
IFC ’s Corporate Governance program which provides direct assistance to local enterprises to 
improve their internal governance arrangements; 
The BERISproject which is also supporting an upgrade of Albania’s metrology and technical 
standards infrastructure, and is complemented by an IFC program on International Standards 
and Technical Regulations which provides direct assistance to small businesses in complying 
with technical standards; 
An Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative trust fund supporting the internationally 
recognized participatory framework for revenue transparency in the mining sector, supported 
by IFC investments in the growing mining sector; and 
An Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant supporting implementation of the UN Aarhus 
Convention on transparency and participation in environmental permitting and decision 
making. 

(iii) Improved, and more financially sustainable, infrastructure services in roads, energy, and 
irrigation 

85. 
Given fiscal constraints and limited Bank resources, the CPS strategy under this objective is to 
(a) consolidate current reforms and complete ongoing investments in the energy and road sectors, 
while working to gradually crowd in new and private financing mechanisms, where possible, and (b) 
and continue investments in the irrigation system. The Government’s request for a gradual shift toward 
municipal water supply will be addressed under the Strategic Objective 3 on reducing Albania’s 
vulnerability to climate change through improvement management, conservation and more efficient use 
of its water resources. 

86. 
In the energy sector, the CPS will focus on consolidating results from the large ongoing portfolio 
which includes four Bank projects and two IFC programs. On the Bank side, the ongoing (i) Power 
Sector Generation and Reconstruction Project is expected to achieve, shortly, the commercial operations 
of the new Vlora Thermal Power Plant to provide an additional 700 GWh in diversified electricity 
generation capacity for Albania; ( i i ) the ECSEE Adaptable Program Loan (APL) 2 Transmission Project 
is financing the replacement of three aging substations critical to improving the quality, reliability and 
efficiency of the bulk power transmission system and building capacity in the newly unbundled 
Transmission System Operator; and (iii) the ECSEE APL 5 Dam Safety Project is supporting efficiency 
improvements on Albania’s largest hydropower cascade, and helping to spur private investment in 
hydropower. In addition, the recently approved Partial Risk Guarantee for the privatized electricity 

26 

distribution company remains critical to ensuring regulatory stability in this sector and facilitated critical 
investments by the new operator. 

87. Meanwhile IFC will continue the ongoing Residential Energy E f lc iency Performance-Based 
Grant Initiative aimed at leveraging up to 7,000 micro loans of around $28 million for energy efficiency 
improvements by households with a target of 24,500 megawatt-hours of energy savings and up to 30,000 
tons per year of greenhouse gases (GHG) avoided by FY12. IFC is also embarking on a Renewable 
Energy Program f o r Small Hydro Power Plants to improve existing regulatory framework, provide 
capacity development to investors and work with selected financial institutions to strengthen the supply of 
project financing for small hydropower plants. Where possible, following on recent successful 
privatizations in the sector, IFC will consider support for power distribution and power generation private 
companies, 

88. 
In the transport sector, the CPS will focus on completion of two ongoing projects: the Transport 
Project which is financing construction of the new Milot-Rreshen section of the road to Kosovo and the 
Secondary and Local Roads Project which underpins the Government?s ongoing $430 million Secondary 
and Tertiary Roads program. After this, the Bank Group will support the institutional development and 
capacity building for the maintenance of the national road network. 
Indeed, the ongoing Transport 
Project is also piloting the use of performance-based maintenance contracts which should lay the basis for 
a planned Road Maintenance and Safety Project in FY 13 to support the creation of coordinated donor 
program for completing rehabilitation and establishing routine maintenance for the national road network. 
In the same vein, IFC has planned advisory services for a Public Private Partnership for the completion, 
maintenance and operation of the new road to Morine on the Kosovo border. IFC will continue to 
encourage the government to attract private sector investments in ports through PPPs and concessions. 
Where possible, IFC will support private sector financing for projects in the transportation sector 
following privatization. 

89. 
The planned Water Resources and Irrigation Project (FY 11) will build on the lessons of past 
investments in irrigation, where still one-third of the national network remains in need of rehabilitation, to 
also address upstream safety and efficiency of irrigation reservoirs, introduce more efficient water 
distribution mechanisms and consolidate recent reforms in irrigation system management and cost 
recovery. 

(iv) Supporting banks and competitive companies 

90. 
Given the global financial crisis, IFC will increase its support for the banking sector with a 
focus on broadening access to finance, especially for MSMEs. IFC will provide a wide variety of products 
tailored to needs of local banks including credit lines, partial guarantee product, and energy efficiency and 
renewable energy products. If needed, IFC will consider support to strengthen banks? capitalization to 
facilitate their lending activities to the real sector. In addition, IFC will contribute to strengthening of the 
microfinance institutions, addressing the economic disparity between rural/semi-urban and urban 
development. 

91. 
The banks have become more risk-averse and the country has been experiencing a slowdown in 
the banks? lending to the local companies. In this environment, one of IFC?s challenges in the country is 
to partially ease the impact of the crisis by providing adequate lending products to the local companies. 
Since most of the companies in the real sector are MSMEs, IFC will provide its support mainly through 
the banking sector. TFC will seek to expand its financing to improve the competitiveness of local 
companies in sectors that can su c c e s sh l ly compete with their exports in the regional market. In 
addition, IFC will support good regional companies that would like to expand their operations in 
Albania. 

27 

92. 
Albania has made good strides on reducing absolute poverty in both urban and rural areas. 
However latest results show that there are emerging pockets of persistent poverty. Moreover, in light of 
the likely slow recovery toward high growth rates, there are risks that recent gains in poverty may 
stagnate. The new CPS includes a continued engagement in broadening access to better quality education 
(in particular at the secondary and higher levels, where Albania’s enrolment rates are significantly lower 
than regional standards) and health services (where Albania’s outcomes also lags behind its neighbors and 
the region). The CPS also refocuses new attention on the effectiveness of Albania’s social protection 
services, where there are opportunities to improve targeting and administration. 

(i) Broader access to education, particularly secondary and higher education, and improved 
quality at all levels 

93. 
The CPS program will continue to support improvements to education and skills development 
through the ongoing Education, Excellence and Equity Project as part of Albania’s first sector-wide 
approach program. The program supports improvements in the quality of secondary education aimed at 
increasing enrolment, reforming higher education management and financing, and strengthening the 
capacity for overall management of the education system. Quality improvements are expected to emerge 
from efforts to: (i) improve school management through training, the establishment of school boards and a 
school grants program; (ii) construct new and extended school buildings to reduce overcrowding; (iii) 
introduce new curricula, textbooks, labs, computers and internet access; and (iv) improve teacher training, 
licensing and continuous professional development. Given the depth of the needs to be addressed and the 
Government’s expressed demand for the Bank to continue to be engaged in this social sector, a follow-on 
Education Project is planned for FY14. However, the scope of this project is expected to be refined over 
the next couple years, and its outcomes are expected to be achieved in the next CPS. 

(ii) Improved access to quality primary health care and more efficient public spending on 
health care 

94. 
The Bank is already supporting key reforms in the health care sector aimed at increasing access to 
quality primary health care services, particularly among the poor, and improving the efficiency of public 
spending on health care. Under this CPS, the Bank will continue to support ongoing reforms in the health 
care sector through the ongoing Health Sector Modernization Project including: (i) reforming primary 
health care provision and financing, including by introducing a Basics Benefit Package and universal 
enrolment with family health providers; (ii) improving quality of primary health care services through an 
extensive re-training and re-equipping program, equipment for primary health care providers; (iii) 
improving the incentives for greater efficiency through performance- and incentive- based contracting; 
and (iv) strengthening hospital governance and management. Given the large unfinished agenda in this 
area, a follow-on Health Sector Project is planned for FY 14. The outcomes are expected in the next CPS. 

(iii) Improved targeting and efficiency in Albania’s social protection systems 

95. 
The CPS will support continued improvements in social protection through the ongoing Social 
Service Deliveg, Project which was extended and restructured to establishment an information system, 
undertake administrative improvements and build capacity for pension system reforms; and ongoing 

28 

analytical work under the Programmatic Poverty Analysis and Advisory Program and the recent 
Economic Governance of Utilities United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Fee-Based Service 

which is supporting the review and revision of the social protection mechanisms for electricity and water 
tariffs. 

However, the main focus of the CPS program will be in two planned new operations, a Social 

96. 
Services Development Policy Loan (FY 1 1) to be followed by a Social Assistance Investment Project 

(FY 12) which would aim to consolidate reforms in social assistance benefit targeting and administration, 
supported by the DPL, and consolidate improvements in Albania’s ability as a middle income country to 
protect its most poor and vulnerable populations. Proposed reforms include: (i) revising eligibility criteria 
and targeting mechanisms for the main social assistance and disability benefits programs; and (ii) 
increasing transparency and efficiency in the allocation of social assistance resources. 

Strategic Objective 3: Reducing Albania’s virlnerability to climate change 
(i) Improved conservation, munagemenf and efficient use of .41bunia’s wuter resources 
(iij Decrcused vulnerbili?v to nmural and munmadc di,sastcrs 

(i) Improved the conservation, management and efficient use of Albania’s water resources 

97. 
The CPS program will support Albania in meeting the challenges of climate change by 
improving the conservation, management and efficient use of its water resources. The strategy focuses 

on building institutions and putting in place investments to improve the efficiency of water resource use 
through the ongoing portfolio of five investment projects, while gradually incorporating three new 
investments in the areas of integrated water resource management and irrigation, municipal water supply 
and sanitation, and environmental services. 

98. 

The ongoing portfolio includes: (i) Natural Resources Development Project which supports 
community-based forest, pasture and micro-catchment conservation planning and investments in over 230 
upland and mountainous communities where erosion is prevalent; and is piloting integrated management 
of three out of Albania‘s seven watersheds; (ii) a Natural Regeneration Bio-Carbon Trust Fund which is 
also piloting the first-ever purchase of carbon-sequestered from natural regeneration that can help to 
restore degraded lands, reduce soil erosion, and improve water quality; (iii) Integrated Coastal Zone 
Management and Clean- Up Project (ICZMCP) which is supporting environmental infrastructure along 
the southern coast, including pollution remediation at a former chemical plant site, water supply and 
sanitation upgrades in two coastal municipalities, construction of an EU-compliant solid waste landfill 
and the development of a management plan for Albania’s most important Ramsar4 site; (iv) a joint 

Albania-Montenegro Lake Shkoder Integrated Ecosystem Management Global Environment Facility 

(GEF) Project that is establishing a Bilateral Lake Management framework for this important shared 
water resource; and (v) following on its successful recycling and linkages program, proposed IFC 

advisory services f o r private participation in solid waste management, complemented where possible 

with financing of concessionaires or direct financing of municipalities for developing regional sanitary 
landfills in line with new national legislation and relevant EU Directives. 

99. 
Two new projects are planned to extend this agenda, under the CPS. The first two: the Municipal 
Water Supply Reform & Investment Project (FY 11) will build on the Bank’s previous experience in 
watedwastewater sector and respond to the Government’s call for increased donor support in this area. 
The project will form the Bank’s main contribution to a donor-wide sector program under preparation by 

The “Ramsar” Convention on Wetlands is an intergovernmental treaty that embodies the commitments to maintain 

the ecological character of their Wetlands of International Importance. 

29 

the Government (in conjunction with KFW/GTZ, Austrian Development Corporation and the Bank) and 
will focus on a policy reform to be defined jointly with Government for both the national and local levels 
and introduce a demand management program in the water sector to facilitate municipal investments by a 
wide range of donor partners. In addition, the project will likely support improvements, and possible 
private participation in one of Albania’s two largest municipal water systems. Meanwhile LFC is actively 
seeking to support through advisory services, private participation in eligible municipal utilities. The 
proposed Environmental Services Project (FY 13) will be a follow-up to the Natural Resources 
Development and Bio-Carbon projects above and will aim to h r t h e r address upstream erosion and other 
degradation issues that impact Albania’s sustainable development. In addition, this project should also be 
an avenue for also crowding external private and public resources toward Albania’s efforts at climate 
change mitigation and adaptation. 

100. 
Finally, the Water Resources and Irrigation Project (FY 12) described above, is mainly part of the 
infrastructure agenda (see paragraph 89) but will also serve this objective of strengthening Albania’s 
water resource management framework. 

(ii) Decreased vulnerability to natural and man-made disasters 

101. The Bank will support Albania’s efforts to strengthen its disaster preparedness, by focusing on 
the implementation of the two ongoing projects and the emergency component of another project which 
has recently been restructured under to respond to the floods in January. Under the Disaster Risk 
Mitigation and Adaptation Project, the Bank is contributing to updating Albania’s disaster response 
strategies, improving its weather forecasting services, revising building codes to be EU-compliant for 
seismic risks, and establishing the Southeast Europe Catastrophic Risk Insurance Facility which will 
promote the provision of disaster and weather risk insurance products in the subregional market. The 
Bank will also complete ongoing support under the Avian InJluenza Control and Human Pandemic 
Preparedness and Response Project, and complete investments to repair and upgrade damaged flood 
protection and other infrastructure in northern Albania under the restructure Land Administration and 
Management Project. 

D. 

The Governance Filter v2.0 

102. Under the last CAS, Albania introduced a Governance Filter aimed at mainstreaming a focus 
on four key governance areas’ into each and every Bank intervention. The Filter was instrumental in 
maintaining the focus on governance issues across the portfolio and in the design of each new project. On 
balance, the contribution of the projects to the creation of stronger institutional mechanisms for 
governance in individual sectors was substantial, including for example, transparent processes for road 
selection, improved licensing of health care providers, blind testing for university entrance and better 
supervision of financial institutions (see Annex 2 for more details). This was later reinforced and further 
enhanced by the Bank’s Country Governance and Anti-Corruption (CGAC) strategy in 2007. Three key 
lessons from the implementation of this Filter and the later CGAC program are (i) the need to strengthen 
the analytical basis for efforts on governance; (ii) focus on approaches and interventions that are more 
tangible to Government officials (and indeed task teams), i.e. more synergies with the ongoing Bank- 
supported activities and reforms; and (iii) create the space for smaller, more just-in-time interventions as 
opportunities arise. 

5 

The Governance Pillars were (i) increased transparency of public spending; (ii) depoliticization of public 
administration and strengthening of independent agencies; (iii) understanding the challenges of local 
government; and (iv) greater citizen participation and demand-side mechanisms for good governance. 

30 

103. These lessons were incorporated into Albania’s proposal for a Window I allocation f r om the 
Bank’s new Governance Partnership Facility (described below in Box 3) and have helped to refine the 
fo cu s of the Governance Filter for the new CPS. Albania’s proposal was notable in that the approach to 
improving governance is essentially one of working through the portfolio in an effort, not only to improve 
implementation of Bank-financed projects, but to effect broader change on the government systems in 
which those projects are embedded. The revised approach seeks to capitalize on the potential of Bank 
projects to enhance the effectiveness of government bodies by bringing expertise to bear on expenditure 
and administrative matters, as a complement sectoral reforms and investments. The Filter specifies 
requirements for the lending program related to: (i) public expenditure management; (ii) administrative 
arrangement; (iii) use, or partial use of some government fiduciary systems; and (iv) public disclosure and 
civil society engagement. 

104. 

First, each project should be fu l l y integrated into the Government’s Medium Term Budget 
Program and the preparation of new projects will require teams to undertake public expenditure 
analysis of government spending in the key ministry or sector. Projects should demonstrate how they 
respond to at least one key public expenditure policy challenge of that sector. During supervision, project 
teams will be required to periodically monitor the implementation of the overall sector budget and 
performance on the identified public expenditure policy challenge together with the line ministry. Sector 
teams will have to liaise and cooperate closely with Poverty Reduction and Economic Management 
Network (PREM) colleagues to feed this information into the Bank’s policy dialogue on fiscal 
management and public expenditure policy. Overall, such an integration of project preparation and 
supervision in the government’s budget processes will help to support, over time, more evidence-based 
resource allocation and increased transparency of public expenditure. 

105. 
Second, each new project should undertake a brief administrative review as pa r t of the design 
of “mainstreamed” implementation arrangements. This requirement responds to the lessons learned 
under the previous CAS. These reviews will help to better identify potential bottlenecks in project 
implementation as well a s other capacity building goals that the project may address, through 
mainstreaming. The Government has already started a process of streamlining the responsibilities for 
donor-financed project management in each line ministry into a single department. The Bank will also 
support the development o f new arrangements, through the projects, wherever possible. 

31 

106. The third requirement relates to the use, or partial use, of the elements of the country 
procurement a n l o r financial management systems that have been approved by Bank’s Regional 

Procurement and Financial Management. Albania has made progress on reforms in public procurement 
and financial management. Both these fiduciary systems continue to receive support under the IPS 
MDTF and the GPF Fiduciary Action Plan. Notably, the Bank is in the process of auditing Albania’s e- 
procurement system, which will outline improvements required for Bank and other IF1 certification of the 
system. The automated Treasury system and development of the External Assistance Information System 
also present the opportunity for full integration of Bank financing into the Government’s financial 
management systems. The Bank will continue this support so that, increasingly, projects can move to 
using the e-procurement and Treasury systems. 

107. 

Fourth, as a supplement to the Bank’s new Access to Information Policy, new and ongoing 

projects will be required to explore mechanisms f o r involving civil society into the supervision and 

monitoring of implementation. A pilot program on such mechanisms is supported by the CGAC-GPF. 

108. Expected outcomes f r om the use of the Governance Filter v2.0 in the Albania portfolio relate 
mainly to government effectiveness rather than to anti-corruption, p e r se. One key outcome would be 

better public expenditure and financial management in central government, as evidenced by a gradual 
improvement in PEFA indicators, particularly those relating to monitoring and reporting on budget 
execution and donor financing. A second outcome relates to implementation of the Paris Declaration on 
development effectiveness, in particular a reduction in the number of free-standing project 
implementation units and greater use of accredited country fiduciary systems, which is monitored by the 
Albanian authorities in the biannual Survey on the Paris Declaration. The final outcome of the 
Governance Filter v2.0 relates to improved disclosure of the Bank’s work with government (not simply 
project outcomes), as evidenced by an improvement in relevant indicators in the periodic Bank Client 
Survey in Albania. 

E. 

The CPS Financing Program 

109. 

New IBRD lending to Albania over the CPSper iod is expected to amount io about US$275 
million, contingent on IBRD’s financial’s capacity. The Bank financing program comprises: 

(i) completion of 1 5 ongoing investmentprojects and large multi-donor trust f u n d , and 

(ii) preparation of 8 new investmentprojects and a series of annual developmentpolicy loans. 
The CPS is planned to include policy-based lending of around US$lOO million (or US$25 million per 
year) but would need to remain flexible given uncertainty in macroeconomic policy and the potential 
f o r worse-than-expected external economic shocks. The proposed DP L operations are planned to focus 

on sectoral reforms in social services in FY 11, and on broader reforms supporting growth and 

32 

competitiveness during FY 12-FY 14. However, the amount of budget support lending will necessarily be 
highly dependent on Albania’s macroeconomic performance and stability over the CPS period. For 
example, DPL lending could be reduced and the freed-up IBRD resources reallocated to investment 
lending in the event that the Government fails to make necessary the fiscal adjustments to return to a 
lower-debt trajectory during the CPS period. Conversely, the Bank should also be prepared for much 
larger DPL support to Albania if the country is hit hard by Eurozone economic events, despite satisfactory 
macroeconomic management. Planned investment operations would then either be postponed or dropped. 
Finally, besides macroeconomic performance, the levels o f planned budget support lending will also be 
subject to IBRD’s financial capacity. Should there be a need for any significant changes to the DPL 
lending currently proposed as a result o f these or other factors alternative scenarios would be discussed 
with Management and presented to the Board in the CPS progress report or via another appropriate 
strategy memorandum, together with new operations. 

110. Depending on the market conditions during the next four years, IFC expects to invest about 
$120-150 million in the private sector in Albania and to use its advisory services to secure private 
financing for road maintenance, water supply, solid waste management, and renewable energy. IFC 
investment in the private sector will be channeled through direct financing in a variety of projects ranging 
from agribusiness to, energy, and social sectors. In the financial sector investments will range from 
strengthening banks’ capitalization (where needed), long term financing for MSMEs, and renewable 
energy and energy efficiency products.

F. 

The CPS Knowledge Program 

11 1. The 2010 Client Survey and the CPS consultation process noted the support among all 
stakeholders for a continued contribution by the Bank to the transparent and public po l icy dialogue on 

the development challenges fac ing Albania. The Bank Group will continue to provide analytical and 
advisory services to help Albania meet the challenges in the coming years, but also to ensure greater 

33 

public engagement in the discussion of these challenges. The recently completed Country Economic 
Memorandum, Investment Climate Assessment, Country Governance Review will be fully disseminated 
in FY 1 1, and then followed by a series of quarterly economic reviews aimed to opening up the dialogue 
on macroeconomic policies. The Bank will also continue its biennial series of local Albania Bank 
Conferences on Development Economics (ABCDE), started under the last CAS, to provide a periodic, 
and neutral, venue for public debate on these and other issues. 

112. The Bank and IFC’s knowledge programs are also helping to move forward regional 
integration in the Western Balkans. 
IFC will continue the implementation of its mainly regional 
program of advisory services in Albania. These are aimed, not only to strengthen the business 
environment and the capacities of the local private sector to compete in a more integrated European and 
international markets, and to make progress on EU approximation in a number of areas, but also to help 
further integrate Albania more with neighboring countries in the sub-region through a sharing of reform 
experiences. On the Bank side, Albania will benefit from more regional economic and sector work. 
Specifically, the Bank has an ongoing program of regional work on poverty analysis and the financial 
sector that focus on regional priorities, and a revolving fund for regional sector work. The recent focus of 
this fund has been on management of local roads and an assessment of the railway sector under the 
SEETO making way for a new regional treaty, energy issues related to the ECSEE, the impact of climate 
change on regional water resources and, most recently, shared experiences and challenges in social 
policy. Future areas will be defined as needs and potential synergies emerge. 

G . 
Monitoring and Evaluation 
113. The CPS will rely on a combination of existing and developing monitoring and evaluation 
mechanisms. First, the Bank will continue its longstanding programmatic support for poverty monitoring 
and analysis in Albania, while emphasizing more explicitly its attention to monitoring and analyzing 
gender disparities. Albania has a well-established program of household based and living standards 
surveys which are conducted every three years, to which the Bank has traditionally provided technical 
support. Similarly, the Bank will expand its regular program of macroeconomic monitoring to include the 
production of public quarterly economic briefs as long as Albania remains on a non-programmatic 
relationship with the IMF. The need for such briefs will be reevaluated from time to time in light of 
growing market access and market information. Finally, the Bank is supporting the development of the 
Government’s own monitoring and evaluation (M&E) mechanisms for the national development strategy 
through the IPS MDTF. 
In terms of program implementation, the Bank will undertake annual joint 
portfolio reviews with the Government and the joint preparation of the CPS Progress Report in FY 13. 

VI. MANAGING RISKS 
114. 
Implementation of the CPS program identified in the previous chapter is subject to four main 
risks as follows: 

, 

1 1 5 . Potential deterioration of the macroeconomic situation. The fragility of Albania’s external 
environment and the country’s current macroeconomic framework and fiscal policy stance present critical 
risks for the Country Partnership Strategy. A further worsening of the external environment and 
financing opportunities, and/or less than adequate policy responses would be addressed through an 
adjustment of the Bank’s program of budget support loans either to meet urgent financing needs or to 
delay or reduce programmed budget support (para 109). The Bank has already intensified its dialogue on 
macroeconomic policy, given the absence of a disbursing IMF program. In addition, the Bank will 
coordinate closely with the EC on monitoring the macroeconomic situation and on the proposed policy 

34 

responses. Nevertheless, given the high levels o f uncertainty, some flexibility will be needed t o program 
appropriate financing responses over the short-to-medium term. 

1 16 . 
Persistent political tensions. 
Although Albania has already made considerable strides in 
consolidating multi-party democracy and peaceful transitions o f power, the political climate remains very 
polarized. With local elections approaching, there are fears that a current stand-off between the 
government and opposition parties over alleged electoral irregularities could persist o r new politically 
divisive issues could emerge. This in turn would have obvious negative implications for CPS 
implementation, both because the attention o f central and local governments would shift from 
development to political issues and also because project and policy decision-making could come to a 
standstill in cases where multi-party boards, jo in t evaluation committees and the like are part of the 
implementation process. Still, the context o f the EU accession agenda with its strong political criteria and 
broad-based support in Albania - across political parties and the general public - should provide 
incentives for early resolution o f political issues. 

117. Bank role in supporting development in Albania. Given that new IBRD lending is relatively 
small and increasingly selective it is possible that our ability to influence sectoral reforms through policy 
dialogue and institutional development could be reduced, especially a s concessional financing from the 
EU becomes more readily available. This, however, need not necessarily affect the achievement o f 
results on the ground a s the Bank Group will continue to provide analytic and advisory services to help 
Albania meet its development challenges. Moreover, the Bank will continue its ongoing practice o f 
partnering with other external partners including the EU to engage in policy dialogue on key issues in a 
coordinated manner. 

1 1 8 . Persistent implementation challenges. Albania needs to accelerate its implementation o f donor- 
financed projects, including those financed by the Bank. However, there are still significant capacity 
weaknesses, not least in intergovernmental coordination, that hinder timely implementation o f the 
portfolio. Such challenges may persist, and even intensify, a s the Government moves ahead on the 
challenging agenda o f EU approximation. The CPS approach of simplifying and streamlining the 
portfolio is meant precisely to reduce the complexity o f Bank support t o Albania and thereby reduce the 
administrative burden for Government. A s such, the Bank will ensure that while moving to a smaller 
number of larger operations, efforts will be made to avoid increasing the internal complexity o f individual 
operations. In addition, the Government ha s recently established a new mechanism a t the Cabinet level to 
focus periodically on key constraints in externally-assisted operations in an effort to resolve bottlenecks 
and accelerate implementation of investment projects across the various sectors.

ANNEX 2: FY06-FY09 CAS COMPLETION REPORT 

CAS Board discussion: 
January 10 ,2006 
CAS Progress Report Board discussion: 
May 25 ,2008 
Period covered by CAS Completion Report: January 2006- December 2009 

Introduction 

- I. 
This Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report (CAS CR) takes stock of the effectiveness of the 
Bank Group’s assistance to Albania during FY06-09 and draws lessons for the preparation of the 
forthcoming Country Partnership Strategy. Where appropriate - i.e., in areas where there is a high 
degree of continuity between the FY06-09 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) and Bank Group- 
supported activities under previous CASs (e.g., establishing a private sector-led growth model, 
improving public sector management) -- the review takes a medium-term look at the impact o f Bank 
assistance rather than limiting itself to the last CAS period. It is the team’s view that this allows for a 
fuller understanding of the Bank role and impact in these areas. For the preparation of this CAS CR the 
team has: 

Examined the alignment between the CAS design and the stated objectives of the 
Government program 

Reviewed progress towards the long-term development objectives of the country 

Reviewed the Bank’s role in supporting observed progress towards these longer term 
objectives 

Undertook an intensive review of project documentation and AAA 

Extensively discussed and consulted with relevant Government officials, other Albanian 
stakeholders, donor representatives and Bank operational staff 

National DeveloDment Goals and Links t o the CAS obiectives 

This report benefited from discussions with the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) team that worked 
on its independent evaluation of the Albania FY06-09 CAS, including undertaking a mission to Albania 
in February 2010. It also draws on key reviews undertaken during the implementation period, most 
notably the CAS Progress Report (CAS PR FY08), project completion reports and ISRs. The CASPR, 
which was discussed in-depth with Government, Parliament and other stakeholders, also made formal 
adjustments to the strategy taking into account realities on the ground. These changes have been taken 
into account in this CAS CR’s assessment of Bank’s performance in Albania. 
- 11. 
Since 1992, when Albania began its transition from decades of political, economic and social isolation, 
successive governments have placed the achievement of better integration with its South-East European 
(SEE) neighbors and eventual EU accession at the top of their development agendas. This goal has 
widespread political support within Albanian society and, to a notable degree, has acted as a unifying 
element in an otherwise often-polarized political environment. After the recovery from the pyramid 
crisis of the late 1990s, the current millennium, and particularly the last 4-5 years, has seen greater 
momentum in Albanian efforts to achieve EU integration. 
In July 2006, the country signed a 
Stabilization and Association Agreement with the EU. Since then, in mid December 2009, Albania 
received the formal questionnaire which is the official start of the EU candidacy review process and an 
extensive response submitted by the Albanian Government is currently under consideration by the EU. 

FY06-FY09 CAS Completion Report 

Within the overarching goal of SEE and EU integration, the main elements of Albania’s 
development strategy are laid out in the National Strategy f o r Social and Economic Development 
(NSSED), which was first adopted by the Government in 2001, and subsequently updatedlrevised and 
readopted as the NSDI in 2007. The NSSED/NSDI is a comprehensive medium-term strategy which 
shifts the national agenda from short-term crisis management to establishing conditions for long-term 
growth, poverty reduction and integration with the EU. The strategy has strong government ownership 
and was prepared through a robust participatory process involving diverse stakeholders from throughout 
Albanian society. 
In summary, the strategy comprises three pillars as follows: (i) improving 
governance, (ii) promoting private sector-led growth, and (iii) fostering human development. The 
NSSED and NSDI both recognize that weak governance and institutions are at the root of Albania’s 
developmental problems. The NSSED/NSDI also accords high priority to the task of reducing poverty, 
raising standards of living, and accelerating the attainment of the MDGs, identifying rapid, private 
sector-led growth as a principal means of achieving these objectives. 

In turn, the World Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy f o r FYsO6-09, which was developed in 
close partnership with Government and other stakeholders, was fu l ly aligned with the NSSEDLNSDI 
and aimed to support the achievement of the outcomes (including those pertaining to EU integration) 
contained therein. Support was organized around two pillars: (i) continued economic growth through 
support to private sector development; and (ii) improving public service delivery, particularly in the 
social sectors. Improved governance was planned to be interwoven throughout the entire CAS program 
through the application of a “Governance Filter” to all Bank-supported interventions including lending, 
analytical work and technical assistance. Application of the Governance Filter to Bank-supported 
products meant that every product was reviewed not only on its technical and strategic merits but also 
on whether or not it contributed to: (i) greater transparency in the use of public resources; (ii) increased 
autonomy and de-politicization of key public sector counterpart organizations; (iii) more analysis of the 
roles of local governments including activities to develop their capacity; and (iv) stronger mechanisms 
for advocacy and more citizen involvement. It was recognized from the outset that better governance 
and institutional strengthening is essentially a longer-term activity, likely exceeding the CAS by several 
years. The importance of the issue however justified its inclusion in the CAS even in the absence of 
specified end-outcomes by the end of the CAS period. 
Each pillar of the CAS served as an umbrella f o r actions in a number of mutually-reinforcing or 
complementary areas which, taken together, would ensure achievement of the main aim@) of the 
pillar. As such, the Pillar 1 objective of accelerated private sector-led growth was to be achieved 
through concerted action in six main areas: (i) maintaining macroeconomic stability; (ii) strengthening 
the financial sector and financial intermediation; (iii) enhancing the business climate; (iv) establishing 
clear property rights and deepening the land market; (v) building and maintaining Albania’s 
infrastructure including through private participation; and (vi) raising agricultural productivity. 
Similarly CAS efforts to strengthen the delivery of services for human development under Pillar 2 
involved several mutually reinforcing initiatives including improving accountability in the education 
system, strengthening technical and organization capacities in the health sector, addressing the fiscal 
sustainability of the social insurance system, and improving water supply and sanitation services in both 
urban and rural areas. 

The CAS included a results matrix with clearly defined outcomes and milestones f o r each of the two 
main pillars, but the matrix was formally revised through the CASPR, since implementation 
experience suggested the need to (0 streamline the number of indicators to be monitored and ( io 
ensure that the milestones and outcome indicators were better aligned with desired CAS goals. The 
outcomes and milestones identified in the CAS results matrix were drawn directly from the project 
development objectives across the portfolio and were therefore carefully specified and generally 
relevant in terms of the areas of influence of Bank activities in achieving development goals. However, 
because they had initially been developed to measure project results, several of the indicators were too 
narrow in scope vis a vis the CAS’S broader objectives (compared with the goals for specific projects), 

44 

FY06-FYO9 CAS Completion Report 

leading to the need either for a multitude of indicators per CAS outcome or, sometimes, to a disconnect 
between the indicators chosen and the desired goal. For example, reduction of financial and 
distribution losses in the power sector (outcome indicators included in the matrix) cannot have any 
appreciable impact on the CAS goal of raising private sector investment unless also accompanied by 
improvements in the reliability of power supply - an indicator not included in the CAS results matrix. 
Similarly, a number of input indicators in education were included in the results matrix to serve a s a 
proxy for quality in the absence of assessment tools for direct quality measurement. Monitoring of 
CAS outcomes during the early years of CAS implementation also suggested that there was a need to 
streamline and better align the indicators being monitored, as a critical means of focusing the 
Government’s and Bank’s attention on the most important development goals supported by the CAS. 
To this end, the FY08 CAS Progress Report involved a systematic effort to streamline the results matrix 
in consultation with the Government and other stakeholders, keeping only the most strategic indicators 
and thereby enhancing the potential for achieving a credible assessment of the impact of CAS activities. 
The consolidated CAS PR matrix focuses on 46 outcomes: 30 for the first pillar and 16 for the second.

Overall, progress towards achievement of CAS results has been very strong, with 48 percent of 
specified CAS outcomes having been fu l ly achieved, and another 41 percent partially achieved or 

45 

FY06-FY09 CAS Completion Report 

clearly on track (Table I ) . As might be expected, progress on the milestones - linked directly to Bank- 
supported activities - has been even higher, with 60 percent achieved, and about 29 percent on track to 
be achieved. When reviewed in terms of achievement of, or progress towards, the results specified in 
the CAS PR matrix, performance appears to be strongest under the second pillar (improved service 
delivery for poverty reduction, particularly in the social sectors). 

When measured in terms of achievement of specified outcomes and milestones, the Bank made its 
best contribution in the social sectors (Pillar 2), where all twelve outcomes were achieved or partially 
achieved 
In education, substantial progress was made in improving inputs to basic and secondary 
education including reform of the curriculum, establishment of local management and school boards in 
about 15 percent of schools and increased equity in the distribution of public resources per student. 
Targets for increased secondary school enrolment were also partially met, with enrollment rising about 
8-9 percent by the end of the CAS period. In health, a major shift in the financing and production of 
health services was initiated through the step-wise introduction of reforms to health insurance, provider 
payment mechanisms, a new co-payment scheme for patients and training of health system managers. 
These steps are expected to have a significant impact on efficiency of services and eventually, lower 
costs to patients. Moreover, steps were taken to increase the quality of care provided through primary 
care facilities through the training of physicians and nurses in 7 of 13 regions and the development of 
evidence-based Clinical Practice Guidelines for the 32 most common diseases/sicknesses in Albania. 
However, health indicators in Albania still remain lower than in comparable neighboring countries, and 
continued attention to access, quality and management improvements will be necessary going forward. 
In education, too, it is critical that reforms continue to increase the number of individuals who have the 
skills and productivity to innovate and creatively solve problems. This is fundamental to the 
Government’s core objective of raising productivity as a principal means of sustaining the impressive 
economic growth achieved thus far. 

CAS activities aimed at poverty reduction and rural development were also very successful in relation 
to identified indicators. All ten indicators identified in this area (under 1.6 and 2.4) were achieved or 
partially achieved. Success with respect to rural development and, hence, reduction of the urban-rural 
poverty gap appears to have been closely related to the participatory approach adopted in the design and 
implementation of several relevant projects - National Resources Development, Water Resources 
Management, Fishery Development, Agricultural Services, Second Community Works and Social 
Services Delivery. Moreover, the participatory and decentralized approaches (Le., substantial 
involvement of local government partners), adopted for several of these operations also had a strong 
positive impact on social service delivery. Recent poverty results show an accelerated reduction of 
poverty rates in rural areas with headcount poverty declining from 24 to 17 percent during 2005-08. In 
addition to growth and human capital investments which helped reduce poverty, the CAS period saw a 
substantial increase in the access of the most vulnerable groups (those with labor-scarcity or other 
constraints that limit ability to benefit from growth) to social assistance services including both social 
care and targeted income transfers for the poorest households. Reform and development of social 
assistance is a continuing priority as is the re-starting of pension reform to ensure sustainable support to 
the nation’s elderly population. 

Achievement of results was also broadly satisfactory under Pillar I , although progress lagged in a 
f e w areas. As discussed in greater detail below, Albania grew rapidly for much of the past ten years 
(and including the first 2.5 years of this CAS), achieving a growth rate as high as 6.5 percent in 2008 
before slowing again to an estimated 2.3% in 2009, in the wake of the global financial and economic 
crisis. Nonetheless, the fact that Albania was able to continue growing through 2009 is in itself 
remarkable, especially when viewed against the backdrop of other ECA economies which for the most 
part suffered declines in GDP. Indeed, Albania was one of only two European countries that was able to 
maintain positive growth throughout the current global recession. Moreover, a broadly sound macro- 
economic framework was maintained until 2008 and a Poverty Reduction Growth Facility-Extended 
Fund Facility (PRGF-EFF) program agreed with the IMF remained on track throughout the CAS 

46 

FY06-FY09 CAS Completion ReDort 

period. By 2008-09, however, the road to better quality fiscal adjustment was marred by two key 
issues: (i) the contracting and implementation of the Rreshen-Kalimash segment of the Durres-Kukes 
road, which placed major pressures on the national budget and (ii) the management of the electricity 
sector which reverted to deteriorating financial performance throughout the CAS period. These two 
factors in effect reversed Albania’s long tradition of fiscal consolidation, although not to the point of 
impairing macroeconomic stability. The success in managing the impact of the global crisis through 
2009 should not, however, lead to complacency: continuing troubles in key European economies - 
especially Greece and Italy - suggests that Albania and other developing countries are now facing a 
different international landscape including greater awareness of the risks of high sovereign debt which 
will demand policy adjustments. A s such, macro-management remains an area in which the Bank 
should remain closely engaged through policy dialogue, AAA and possible policy-based lending. 

The Pillar 1 CAS program was instrumental in supporting the creation of a number of important 
building blocks on which to move fu tu re progress in public sector management. The CAS period saw 

a continuation of the broadly positive trends across all major aspects of governance including: (i) 
strengthening voice and accountability; (ii) improving the quality of economic regulation as evidenced 
by improved rankings in the Global Competitiveness Index and Doing Business; (iii) policy 
coordination, public expenditure management, procurement improvements and better internal and 
external audit. More specifically the CAS period saw critical reforms in public expenditure 
management including a new budget law, procurement law and public investment management 
procedures, privatization of the electricity distribution company, inspections reform under BERIS. The 
new Territorial Planning Law and ongoing support for land registration has also been important 
although significant efforts will continue to be necessary for some time to come. However, efforts to 
strengthen the civil service have thus far been only marginally effective, if at all. The key area of 
failure has been in the area of civil service law implementation and the de-politicization of public 
administrations, notwithstanding a strong effort under the CAS program. 

The infrastructure goals under Pillar 1 of the CAS program were largely met with respect to 
transport but progress on energy has been relatively slow and d i f f u l t -- although sustained effort 

appears to finally be bearing f ru i t . Transport activities under the CAS focused on roads maintenance, 
roads quality (reduced roughness), road safety and increased efficiency through introduction of private 
contracts for road maintenance. Stated CAS objectives were met or surpassed in each of these areas. 
Moreover, the Bank played an important role in supporting the Government to rehabilitate and expand 
its network of secondary and local roads, both through a Bank-financed project and, equally 
importantly, through catalyzing around US$400 million from other external partners for road 
improvement and construction. Improvement in the electricity sector has been relatively slower and 
more difficult but sustained efforts are beginning to have some positive impacts - most notably the 
unbundling of the electricity system and privatization of the distribution company (through jo in t World 
Bank Group support) as well as reduction in energy losses and investment in transmission rehab and 
thermal power generation. 

Finally, results with respect to the governance f i l le r show progress across the board (see Cha r t l ) , 
with notable successes in terms of institution-strengthening on a sectoral basis but slower-than- 
hoped-for progress on system-wide efforts to improve the rule of law, including controlling 

corruption vis a vis businesses. All projects and the majority o f the non-lending services during the 
CAS period included a governance focus or components and attempted to address institutional 
strengthening in some way. On balance, it would appear that the contribution of the projects to the 
creation of stronger mechanisms for governance in individual sectors was substantial. Especially 
noteworthy examples in terms of improved transparency and management of the sectors include: (i) in 
education, the introduction of school boards and blind testing for university entrance exams; (ii) better 
licensing of providers and introduction of performance contracts in the health system; (iii) strengthened 
community management o f forests, (iv) establishment of user associations in irrigation and fisheries; (v) 
improved management o f social care centers; (vi) better supervision of the financial sector, including 

47 

FY06-FY09 CAS Completion Repor t 

microcredit and insurance providers; (vii) substantially improved pensions records; and (viii) more 
transparent and more technically sound selection of road investments. By contrast, none of the 
systemic outcomes under the second country development goal of: “enhancing effectiveness of public 
sector and governance structures to support private sector development” was fully achieved, 
notwithstanding an active CAS program in this area and some progress in building the blocks for future 
improvement. Overall however, there can be little doubt that while much remains to be done, 
governance improvements already made - especially in the effectiveness of public administration - 
have been instrumental in the country’s impressive economic performance and improved human 
development outcomes.

PILLAR 1: Continued Economic Growth through Support to Private Sector Development 

Detailed Results 

Albania continued on its trajectory of strong growth during the CAS period and joined the middle 
income group in 2008. During 2006-08, Albania saw growth rates of 6 percent on average and was one 
of the few countries in the region to maintain a positive rate of real growth in 2009, estimated at about 
2.3 percent. The economy has achieved robust non-inflationary growth, albeit with increasing external 
imbalances. Sound macroeconomic management continued until 2007, including sustained efforts to 
achieve fiscal consolidation, debt reduction, and improvements in external balances. Fiscal balances 
were constrained below real growth rates, at around 3 percent. Tax revenue increased by over 2 
percentage points of GDP in 2008, despite a cut in corporate and personal income tax rates. As part of a 
better, more integrated policy-framework, improvements in public debt management took place and led 
to a reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio from 56 percent in 2006 to 53 percent in 2007, and to a doubling 
of the average maturity of public debt. Clearance of the majority of arrears on inoperative historical 
external debt has taken place, with a few outstanding agreements to be finalized. Despite elevated levels 
of CAD, the Albanian foreign position has remained sustainable throughout the CAS period. 

As already mentioned, Albania has been one of the few European countries to maintain positive growth 
after the onset of the global financial and economic crisis, due in large part to its limited exposure to 
international markets as well as to the expansionary fiscal policy initiated before the crisis. In 2007, 
Albania embarked on a very large - and geopolitically strategic - infrastructure project which has 
ultimately caused a deviation from its long-standing policy of fiscal consolidation. In 2009, together 

48 

FY06-FY09 CAS Completion Repor t 

with some pre-election spending on wage and pension increases, this infrastructure project formed the 
basis of a fiscal expansion (approximately 8.2 percent of GDP) that would ease the impact of the global 
financial crisis. However, in the latter half 2009, when the real impact of lower remittances and falling 
exports began to emerge, the Government was slow in adjusting its spending policies in line with 
falling revenues. The fiscal deficit jumped to 6.9 percent of GDP in 2009 and public debt approached 
60 percent of GDP, up from 53.7 percent in 2007. Government has since been forced to cut both capital 
and recurrent expenditures. While the authorities remain committed to bringing fiscal policy back into 
line, expenditure adjustments are less than orderly and could potentially tarnish Albania’s reputation for 
sound fiscal management. Despite these deviations, public debt remains sustainable, if the government 
maintains its commitment to return to fiscal consolidation. 

Cross-country analysis of expenditure efficiency shows that while levels of public investments and 
employment (wage bill) are broadly appropriate, the country could achieve better outcomes with its 
current level o f spending. Nevertheless, under-funding of non-wage inputs reduces productivity and is 
associated with low levels of educational achievements and inadequate health care. 

CAS Outcome: Integration of various policy frameworks into a single medium-term development 
plan aligned with budget and MTEFMTBP [Achieved] 

In general, Albania has achieved better alignment of its budget with medium term development 
objectives and strategic policy choices. In 2007, the Government undertook a major updating of its 
national development plan, now called NSDI. This process included the development of 32 sectoral 
and cross-cutting development strategies which were consulted with the private sector, civil society and 
development partners. Meanwhile, the IPS has been adopted and is being implemented to integrate the 
various programs, projects and strategies of the NSDI with the Medium Term and annual budget 
processes. In 2008, with support from the Bank under the Development Policy Reform Program, the 
Parliament adopted the new organic budget law to formalize a series of improved budgeting procedures 
that have been underway in the medium term budget process for several years. Meanwhile, the IPS has 
achieved a significant level of systematization with the production of annual progress reports, including 
an External Assistance Orientation document for donors.6 Future progress should focus on better 
integration of public investment planning into the MTBP, deepen consultation with non-governmental 
actors, and further enhance the information systems that link development plans with public 
expenditures. Progress on the latter is supported by a Bank-supervised, multi-donor trust fund 

CAS Outcome: Broad stakeholders, including NGOs and the private sector, are consulted f o r major 
policy formulation [Partially Achieve4 

The World Bank, together with other development partners, has been instrumental in spreading the 
culture o f public consultation into public projects and programs in Albania. 
Progress remains 
incipient, but promising. A broad consultation process was conducted for the NSDI: each of 32 sub- 
strategies was individually discussed with civil society, private sector and development partners, 
demonstrating that the consultation process -- begun in the PRSP process under the previous CAS - is 
now fully established in Albania and has been internalized by the Albanian Government as well as 
many other stakeholders. 
Some notable examples of the effective use of consultation in CAS- 
supported legislative and policy reforms include the processes associated with developing the Law on 
Local Government Borrowing, the Health Care Law, the Territorial Planning Law and the South Coast 
Development Plan. Most of these involved several months, (and in the case of the Territorial Planning 
Law and the Health Care Law, several years) of consultations with Parliamentary committees, national 

6 

For example, the Bank-supported Report on Standards and Compliance (ROSC) Accounting and Audit Country 
Action Plan was later formalized by Government into an additional NSDI strategy for accounting and audit. 
Likewise, preparation of a new donor-coordinated effort to support water and wastewater investments 
nationwide is being preceded by a revision of the national water and wastewater strategy to improve its policy 
content. 

49 

FY06-FY09 CAS Completion Report 

and local government and local communities. Consultations for the South Coast Development Plan 
have been hailed by the national government, local beneficiaries, and the local Aarhus Convention 
Centre as a best practice in Albania. 
In the social sectors, the Bank has supported successful 
consultations on social policy for vulnerable groups through the Social Services Delivery Project and 
multi-party dialogue on pension reform for several months, at the request of Government. Although the 
latter did not yield reform consensus, the political leadership on all sides now recognizes the need for 
systematic dialogue to arrive at a workable reform strategy. 

Notwithstanding the above, this CAS outcome is considered Partially Achieved in part because of the 
challenges on the government-private sector dialogue front. Although the Government reopened 
discussions with the Business Consultative Council (established in 2002) in 2006, these have since 
lapsed and been less than effective. BERIS project has emphasized consultations with the private sector 
in its preparation, and subsequent support for licensing and inspections reform and the establishment of 
a regulatory impact assessment system. Although such assistance is now getting traction, the 
Government has moved ahead too rapidly with an under-prepared and under-consulted reform of 
licensing from which the Bank had to withdraw support. Likewise, during 2008-09, the Government 
undertook a series of fast-tracked regulatory changes, e.g. in tax and other policies, with little or no 
consultation or public discussion - in effect creating an emerging climate of some regulatory instability. 

CAS Outcome: Improved quality o f f i c a l adjustment, as evidenced by increasing the share of non- 
wage recurrent spending [Not Achieved] 
As targeted, the fiscal criteria of the new IMF program were achieved for most of the program period 
leading to the closure of the Fund?s 3-year PRGF-EFF program in early 2009. Public finances have 
strengthened, largely due to improved tax reform and improved tax administration. The share of non- 
wage spending in the recurrent budget has increased marginally (add numbers). However, over the CAS 
period, Albania did reverse its trend toward fiscal consolidation toward increasing deficits associated 
with the ballooning expenditures for the Rreshen-Kalimash section on the road to Kosovo, and 
increasing fiscal transfers to cover the deficits at the electricity company. Within-year fiscal 
adjustments to emerging constraints remain somewhat ad hoc as part of a budget process that has 
involved persistent supplementary budgets.

CAS Outcomes: Public investments are planned and prioritized in a contestable process based on 
solid analysis. [Achieved] 

50 

FY06-FY09 CAS Complefion Report 

Albania now has a realistic, coherent and authoritative basis for the planning and prioritization of public 
investment projects. The NSDI and its component parts have been developed within a realistic 
macroeconomic and fiscal framework. Specific guidance on economic infrastructure (transport, energy, 
wastewater and sanitation, and environment) is provided by sector. Nevertheless the quality and 
coverage of the various strategies are variable and further effort is required to improve the strategic 
focus and therefore the guidance for annual investment budgeting. On the institutional side, the 
Government introduced budgetary reviews of investment projects, developed a register of public 
investment projects and adopted new Public Investment Management Procedures in 2008. These are 
gradually being internalized by line ministries in budget preparation. 
In 2007, the Government 
introduced a competitive mechanism for distribution of grants to local governments for municipal 
investments. 

In the roads sector, public investments are informed by a regularly updated Albania National Transport 
Plan and analyzed carefully by the General Roads Directorate (GRD). The Bank also has supported the 
establishment of a road asset management system and investment allocation system for a large donor- 
finance investment program on secondary and local roads. However, there remain instances when new 
investments are introduced in an ad hoc manner. 
In energy, the selection of largely donor-financed 
projects has been guided by the Power Sector Action Plan, whereas in the municipal water sector, it has 
largely been ad hoc. The Government is now preparing a master waster sector investment plan. 
Support for the preparation of a hospital master plan in provided by the Health Sector Modernization 
Project. Meanwhile Education Excellence and Equity Project (EEEP) has assisted MoES to include 
demographic analysis for its school investment choices, to strengthen its investment department, 
establish new building standards for schools, and in the ongoing preparation of a school mapping plan 

Governance has been improving very gradually in Albania over the years, but the situation still calls for 
further improvement. Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) percentile ranking on the indicator of 
government effectiveness has improved from 3 1 to 45 between 2005 and 2008 while that of regulatory 
quality rose fi-om 47 to 57, and rule of law from 24 to 33. It should be noted that these indicators 
remain low for a middle income country. On perceptions of corruption, Albania’s rank improved from 
108 out of 146 countries with a score of 2.5 in 2004 (on a scale of 1 - 10 where 10 is the best) on 
Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) to 95 out of 180 countries with a score 
of 3.2 in 2009. 

Only modest progress has been made towards creating a public administration based on meritocracy 
and professionalism, an important goal for the CAS. The organizational structures of line ministries are 
slowly improving with support from individual projects, but implementation of the broader civil service 
law has deteriorated. High turnover of public officials following changes in ministerial leadership 
remains a hallmark of the Albanian civil service and continues to hinder the ability of the public sector 
to implement reform agendas systematically over time. New laws on procurement (enacted in 2006) 
and public concessions (2007) are helping to improve interactions between the State and the private 
sector, but there continues to be a need to strengthen institutional capacity and strengthen adherence to 
the rule of law in government decision-making. 

CAS Outcomes: Computerized treasury system is fully operational and begins to expand to selected 
spending ministries [Partially Achieved] 

A modern treasury system has been set up in Albania since 2005 with support from the Public 
Administrative Reform Project (PARP, closed in 2006), and further supported under the multi-donor 

51 

FY06-FY09 CAS Completion Repor t 

IPS trust fund since mid 2008. However efforts to fully computerize the system and to expand it to 
other parts of government have been substantially delayed, largely because of insufficient political 
commitment and significant weaknesses in project management and technical skills in the central 
departments. The Bank did not extend the P A W in 2007, when it closed, due to this lack of 
commitment. However, there had been a trend towards improved progress at the tail end of the project 
and it remains a question as to whether a fifth year of implementation and Bank supervision, could have 
accelerated progress at that time. The lack of a fully functioning treasury system put at risk the 
integrity of the public financial management system and affected disbursements in Bank projects which, 
under this CAS, moved to use country systems in financial management. However, it is expected that 
the computerized system will be fully operational in early 2010 after renewed efforts in recent months. 
Links to the Human Resources Management Information System, technical extensions needed for the 
IPS, and donor support to expand the system to other parts of government, remain hampered by the 
delays in finalizing fu l l computerization of the treasury system. 

CAS Outcomes: Public procurement is conducted in accordance with a law meeting European 
standards. [Partially Achieved] 

A new Public Procurement Law was enacted in 2006 and became effective in 2007, as part of the 
Development Policy Operation reform program. The new law is aligned with EU legislation, except for 
the structure of the complaints mechanism. After being addressed through the DPO I1 reform program, 
the issue of the complaints mechanism is being finally resolved with support from EU, owing in part to 
a discrepancy between Bank and EU approaches to the issue. 

Nevertheless, the new law addressed several bottlenecks in the previous legislation such as overuse of 
direct procurement and the lack of transparency in procedures. The new law has in fact significantly 
reduced the use of direct procurement. According to the Public Procurement Agency (PPA), in 2008, 
8.8 percent of procurement contracts over US$4000 were carried out by direct contracting compared 
with close to a quarter of all contracts in 2005 (check OECD DAC which should haveJigures). Open 
tendering (national and international) is now the most commonly used procurement method, 
representing 56 percent of the total number of procurement contracts in 2008, compared with 38 percent 
in 2004. Regarding transparency, all contract notices, bidding documents and awards are published in 
the PPA website and Albania has rolled out a new e-government procurement system (EPS) to most of 
its contracting authorities in 2009 with support from US - MCC program. 

The passage of the new procurement law allowed the Bank to partially use some elements of the 
country system for project procurement. This is now the case for all the projects approved under this 
CAS. The Bank remains an important partner for Albania in the improvement in public procurement. 
Having encouraged the Donor Technical Secretariat to expand joint work on fiduciary systems, in line 
with Paris Declaration, the Bank now sits on the advisory group for the UNDP -financed 2"d OECD 
DAC procurement Assessment. Meanwhile, the Bank is in the process of evaluating the EPS for use in 
Bank and other donor-financed projects which are recipient-executed, and will support further 
refinements under the Governance Partnership Facility Window 1 Program. The Bank, together with 
other donors has and is also supporting training in public procurement for public administration 
students at the University of Tirana. 

CAS Outcomes: A l l new concessions are implemented in line with transparent and effective legal 
framework. [Partially Achieved] 

The Bank and IFC supported the preparation and enactment of the new concessions law in December 
2006 requiring competition including a more transparent treatment of unsolicited bids. 
IFC 
subsequently supported the preparation of two open competitions, for the Ashta Hydropower Plant 
which was successfully awarded in 2009, and the Durres Port container terminal which was haited by 
Government also in 2009. In 2009, as part of the preparation of the (subsequently-cancelled) DPO 11, 

52 

FY06-FY09 CAS Completion Report 

the Bank supported a review of the implementation of the law. The review found that while in general 
the law was being implemented in line with its legal provisions, the process of granting concessions 
was not fully effective in terms of maximizing the public value of the concessions awarded. Notably, 
the government has demonstrated a tendency to accelerate the process of granting concessions, despite 
very limited technical preparation on its side to ensure that the final concessions maximize public value. 
Since passage of the law, the majority of concessions awarded were initiated by unsolicited bids7, 
instead of by government-prepared open competitions. As a result, there has been a series of 
government actions to reevaluate previously granted concessions, on the basis of either non-compliance 
of private operators with the agreements, or questions on the process of awards. This also points to the 
lack of preparatory work and quality assurance on the public sector side. The lesson here is that 
following such a major legal reform in an important area of governance for Albania, there is a need for 
continued implementation support not only to strengthen institutional capacities but also to continue to 
reinforce political commitment a t the highest levels. 

CAS Outcomes: Configuration of public sector institutions adjusted to reflect mandates and 
functions. (Partially Achieved] 

Under the Public Administration Reform Project (PARP), functional reviews were prepared for each 
line ministry. In early 2006, the Government issued a decree revising the public sector salary structure 
and revising the structures of almost all the ministries, generally in line with the recommendations of 
these reviews. It also began implementing the recommendations to enhance policy formulation and 
coordination, including the strengthening and improving the transparency o f the cabinet, donor 
coordination and the establishment of an IPS, While few of the functional reviews prepared under the 
PARP were implemented, several line ministries have benefited from substantial institutional 
development through individual Bank-financed projects, including in budget, treasury, public 
investment and debt management departments and the Financial Supervisory Authority in the Ministry 
of Finance, policy, quality assurance and investment departments of education and health in their 
respective Ministries, roads and maritime transport, water in the Ministry of Public Works, Transport 
and Telecom, forestry in the Ministry of Environment, Public Procurement Agency, and the Ministry of 
Economy, Trade and Energy in the areas of regulatory management. Nevertheless a handful of 
ministries continue to be plagued by frequent reorganizations and structural changes that hinder policy 
reform and strategy implementation. 

CAS Outcomes: Consistent implementation of the civil service law. (Not Achieved] 

Under the former CAS period, Albania approved a Civil Service Law in 1999, which is in line with 
good international practice, and subsequently, in 2000, established a new Department of Public 
Administration (DoPA) and a Civil Service Commission (CSC). Initially, the Law did help to improve 
practices in some ministries and to influence the behavior and the incentive structure for decisions on 
civil service appointments and dismissals. However, since 2005, compliance has deterioriated to the 
point of being extremely uneven and ad hoc. The Department of Public Administration was 
downgraded, and decisions of the CSC and ultimately the courts have been frequently disregarded by 
government bodies. The high turnover o f senior staff remains a hallmark of each change of minister, 
even between electoral periods and without a change of political party, with the result that Government 
is losing its ability to retain highly qualified and experienced staff in key technical positions for long 
periods of time. Meanwhile, the DoPA has not been able to stop the increase in the use of term 
contracts to hire civil servants, nor to ensure implementation of CSC decisions and to exercise its 
authority as the managing authority of the civil service system. The Bank, through the PARP, the DPO 
program and other instruments, supported the implementation of the civil service law in a polarized and 
tense political environment, limited institutional capacity, and several changes in heads of key

Country Development Goal: 
Business environment is conducive t o attracting higher 
levels of both domestic and foreign investment 

Domestic private investment increased from 19 percent of GDP in 2005 to an estimated 21 percent in 
2009. However, at least half of this investment is devoted to a single sector -- construction. While, FDI 
rose significantly from 3 . 3 percent of GDP in 2005 to 8.2 percent in 2009, its absolute level still 
remains among the lowest in the sub-region. Albania improved its ranking on the Doing Business 
indicator from 120th in the 2006 index (which measured performance in 2005) to 82nd in the 2010 
index (which measures performance in 2009). The basis for this improvement was significant reforms 
in time and cost of registering a business, trading across borders (including reducing bribery in 
customs) and improvements in the regulations for getting credit and protection of shareholders. 
Albania’s percentile ranking on the WGI indicator of regulatory quality increased from 49 to 57 
between 2005 and 2008, rule of law from 16 to 24 and control of corruption from 29 to 39. As such, 
Albania still has a long way to go to attain a conducive business environment for domestic and foreign 
investment . 

CAS Outcome: Improved regulation and supervision of insurance and micro-credit institutions 
[Achieved] 

Licensing, regulation, and supervision of microcredit institutions have been strengthened with the 
issuance by the Bank of Albania (BOA ) of a regulation “On the Granting of License to Non Bank 
Financial Subjects” and a regulation “On Supervision Norms of Microcredit Institutions” in 2009. 
Moreover, BOA has prepared updated onsite and offsite supervision manuals and reporting formats for 
microcredit institutions and credit unions. Meanwhile, in 2006, the independent supervisor for the non- 
banking sector, the Financial Supervisory Authority was established, became fully operational and is 
implementing measures to improve the performance of insurance companies. FSA has recently 
introduced supervision manuals, minimum capital tests, set of financial ratios to improve supervision 
and performance of insurance companies and its transition to a risk based supervisory approach. Other 
instruments include the actuarial valuation of non-life claims with intervention ladder, claims 
management policy handling the claims payment specifically focusing to policy-holders protection and 
the 5 year road map for transition period. The supervision of the insurance sector will become gradually 
better and efficient after the implementation of these steps. Another noteworthy development in the 
sector is the introduction of a series of serious steps in motor insurance mainly in motor third party 
liability (i.e establishment of a motor insurance information center; developing a data base including 
premium and claims history and issuing regulation for establishing stricter criteria on the quality of 
reinsurers; etc). The new draft insurance law has been prepared in accordance with th eEU 
legal framework while technical regulations have been under preparation. All these improvements were 
supported by technical assistance under the FIRST program. 

CAS Outcome: Improved investor perceptions and reductions in time and costs f o r compliance with 
business licensing and inspections as measured by ARCS, Doing Business, BEEPS, a n l o r ICA [Not 
Achieved] 

Albania has taken important steps to upgrade the regulatory framework for businesses and to remove 
harmful administrative barriers, with notable results in some respects. The Government has been 
successful in implementing a comprehensive reform program to establish of an efficient, sustainable 
and transparent regulatory system, with the goal of increasing investment levels, enhancing competition 
and stimulating business growth. These efforts are reflected in the improving Doing Business indicators 

54 

FY06-FY09 CAS Completion Report 

and ranking: Albania moved from 136’’ in 2007 to 82nd in 2010 and achieved the second-highest rank 
among the top ten reformers worldwide in 2009. Albania’s overall improvement in Doing Business 
rankings does however mask considerable variation in ranking on individual indicators. For example, 
the country’s rankings ranged from 15& for protection of minority shareholder rights, to 91st on 
enforcing contracts, to 1731d on getting construction permits. However, a significant gap remains 
between officially adopted regulatory policies and their implementation and enforcement. The recent 
CEM and ICA note that this significantly reduces the otherwise high returns to private investment in 
Albania, deterring both foreign and local investors. 
Informal enforcement practices, including 
inconsistent and unpredictable interpretation of regulation or arbitrary enforcement by the judicial 
system, impose a burdensome “time tax” and “bribe tax” on firms, thus eroding the benefits of 
regulatory reform. Notably, 58 percent of Albanian firms report the need to pay bribes to government 
officials to “get things done” - a far higher share than in comparator countries. The time tax is also 
more burdensome in Albania than in comparator countries, with a reported 19 percent of Albanian 
managers’ time spent dealing with government regulations and, for example, an average of 5.5 visits by 
tax officials experienced per year. Overall, Albania performs very poorly in terms of regulatory quality, 
control of corruption and rule of law, dimensions of the globally-estimated WGI that capture the 
informal regulatory environment. 

CAS Outcome: Improved accounting and auditing standards and disclosure of corporate information 
in line with EU requirements [Partially Achieved] 

During this CAS period, Albania put in place several elements of a modern corporate financial 
reporting framework, including adopting the Country Action Plan to Enhance Corporate Financial 
Reporting in Albania in February 2009 (based on the 2006 Accounting and Audit ROSC) and passing a 
new Auditing Law in March 2009. In 2008, Albania also enacted amendments to its company law 
which focus on shareholder rights to information about company performance, and include access to 
consolidated accounts and reports. The increased banking penetration and the increased number of 
international audit companies doing business in Albania suggest that a larger proportion of firms are 
now complying with financial reporting obligations and International Financial Reporting Standards, 
which are required for Public Interested entities as per 2004 Accounting Law. Nevertheless, there 
remains a sizeable gap between written legislation and its implementation. 

1.4 
Country Development Goal: Enhance national infrastrrtcture nwessary for economic 
growth and private sector development 

The Government formally adopted the Albanian National Transport Plan (ANTP) in 2005 and the 
Transport Sector Policy and Strategy in 2007. The ANTP, prepared with support from the EU, and 
agreed with the international financial institutions (IFIs), provides the basis for an overarching 
framework for the sector and guidance to resource allocation in the sector. However, the link to the 
overall strategic planning and budgeting frameworks needs to be strengthened further. Improvement is 
required to increase efficiency and accountability in public spending by improving the planning, 
budgeting, and execution of public investment projects, in particular those financed with government 
resources only. During the CAS period, the Bank has been involved in the transport sector through one 
closed and two ongoing operations. 

Improvement in the electricity sector has been very slow and difficult, but sustained efforts over a 
relatively long period started to have a positive impact by the end of the CAS period. With World Bank 
Group support, Albania joined the Energy Community of South East Europe during the CAS period. 
Meanwhile energy losses declined, billing collections improved (although very marginally), 
rehabilitation of transmission was initiated, public investment in thermal power generation was 
undertaken, the electricity system was unbundled, and the distribution system privatized. Nevertheless 
the public electricity company was in difficult financial straits on an almost continuous basis. The 
successful privatization of the distribution company in 2009, supported by IFC as transaction advisor, 

5 5 

FY06-FY09 CAS Completion Report 

and with a Bank Partial Risk Guarantee, was a critical reform that is expected to help to ease cash flow 
in the sector in the future. Finally, efforts to safeguard the country’s major hydroelectric plants and to 
improve their operational efficiency are now underway. 

CAS Outcome: Annual 5% increase in real budgets f o r road maintenance and introduction ofprivate 
sector maintenance contracts [Achieved] 

The Bank supported this sector through the Road Maintenance Project (already completed) and the 
ongoing Transport Project. Under the former project, a condition requiring the government to increase 
the annual budget of the GRD for maintenance by no less than 5 percent per year, was systematically 
met. Still, by end-2006, according to the Bank’s Public Expenditure Institutional Review (PEIR), 
Albania spent approximately 40 percent less than required on maintenance of the national road network. 
Subsequently, under the Transport Project the covenant was increase to achieve a 10 percent increase in 
funding for road maintenance annually and has also been systematically met. The Transport Project is 
also supporting the introduction of output- and performance-based road maintenance for 10 percent of 
the national road network, for which contracts have recently been signed for two pilot regions. 

CAS Outcome: Reduced roughness index of 1,000 km of main and rural roads f r om 9.79 in 2002 to 
7.4 in mid-2007 [Aclzieved] 

A reduction in the roads roughness index has been achieved and continues t o be pursued. The Road 
Maintenance Project contributed to reducing the roughness index from 10 for national roads and 19 for 
rural roads to 5 and 8, respectively. Moreover, the new Transport Project (approved in 2007) is aiming 
to reduce roughness levels even further before its completion in 2012 with output- and performance- 
based maintenance contracts for 3 1 Okm or 10 percent of the national road network. 

CAS Outcome: 1,000 km of secondary and local roads rehabilitated or reconstructed by 2010 
[Partially Achieved] 

Under the Secondary and Local Roads Project, the Bank is financing rehabilitatiodimprovement of 1 10 
km of secondary and local roads, which are expected to be completed by the third quarter of 20 10. With 
this project, the Bank has also catalyzed around US$400 million in commitments from other donors for 
rehabilitating and improving additional 1,000-1,500 km of the secondary and local roads network. 

CAS Outcome: Reductions in road accident and fatality rates by addressing accident black-spots 
[Achieved] 

Road accident fatality rates in Albania have been reduced from 15.12 per 10,000 registered vehicles in 
2000 to 8.64 at the end of 2006. This improvement was better than the target of “10 % reduction’’ 
pursued by the Bank-financed Road Maintenance Project and the Transport Project. To reduce 
accidents, a multi-agency safety program was implemented. Road safety barriers at various locations in 
selected national roads were installed and 60 black-spots were improved. Directorate Road Safety 
reports have been disseminated to the public as a way of promoting awareness. Nevertheless, these 
rates are still one of the highest in the region and more than eight-fold higher than the European best. 

CAS Outcome: Increase domestic p o wer generation capacity by 15 percent [Achieved] 

The Bank, together with EBRD and European Investment Bank (EIB) has supported the construction of 
the Vlora Thermal Power Plant which represents the first significant investment in domestic power 
generation in over 25 years in Albania. With an installed capacity of 750 GWh, the plant, which was 
commissioned in early 2010, bring an 18 percent increase in average domestic power generation 
capacity. Furthermore under the Dam Safety Project, the Bank will contribute to further increases by 
supporting the optimized utilization of the cascade of dams on the Drini river, which are responsible for 
the largest share of domestic generation.

FY06-FY09 CAS Comp le t ion Repo r t 

CAS Outcome: Achievement of annually agreed Power Sector Action Plan targets f o r reductions in 
transmission and distribution losses [Not Achievedj 

This outcome has not been achieved. The Power Sector Action Plan has been in place for very limited 
periods during the CAS implementation. From 2005-06, a coordinated suspension of donor financing 
was required to ensure its implementation by Government. And again in 2008, no final agreement was 
ever reached on plan targets with government. Nevertheless, intermediate indicators/milestones have 
been achieved, including the gradual reduction of transmission and distribution losses, from about 42 
percent in 2007 to 34 percent in 2009; and the privatization of the distribution network with, among 
others, a target to further reduce losses to 15 percent and improving colIections by 2014. These 
improvements have not, however, been sufficient to reduce the unreliability and increase the quality of 
electricity supplies to households and businesses. In 2008, businesses in Albania experienced 32 power 
outages per month on average and 80% of firms reported owning or sharing a generator, in turn 
supplying about 30% of the power consumed by them. Despite low nominal tariffs for electricity 
(10Lek per KwH - more or less stable over the CAS period) the actual cost to firms is about 3 times 
higher because of the high cost of using diesel generators. As a result, the broader CAS objective of 
attracting more private investment will require much more reliable supplies of electricity from the 
national grid. 

1.5 
Country Development Goal; Establish efiicient land markets and spatial planning to 
support rural and urban development 

The land market in Albania is gradually becoming more efficient but property rights are not yet secure. 
Progress is being made on improving land registration and the share of land parcels that are titled, albeit 
much more slowly than anticipated. Meanwhile, no progress has been achieved on planned pilots on 
property valuation and taxation, and on legislative reforms to strengthen property rights. Weaknesses in 
institutional coordination and frequent legislative changes, that are only partial solutions, seemed to be 
underpinned by a lack of political will to relinquish territorial control from longstanding governance 
problems. In terms of spatial planning, the Bank supporting for land use planning in both urban and 
southern coastal areas has now been cancelled owing in part to emerging safeguard risks related to the 
use of demolitions to enforce development controls, and, as well, to the limited capacities and 
commitment at the national level. Nevertheless, the passage of the new Territorial Planning Law and 
the South Coast Development Plan and regulations, provide important building blocks for Albania's 
continued improvement in this area. 

CAS Outcome: Accelerate completion of urban and rural cadastral zones (Target: 50% urban, 75% 
rural-currently 81 % rural completed) /Partially Achievedj 

The target for rural zones was already been achieved by the time of the CAS Progress Report in 2008, 
but there has not yet been any significant progress on the urban areas because of delays in the 
contracting of registration packages under the Land Administration and Management Project. 
Nevertheless, the detailed inventories of unregistered properties in the 83 cadastral zones are complete, 
and three large registration contracts are under implementation with related work on quality control. 
Upon completion, these should result in the registration of around 41 0,000 properties representing 47 
percent of total urban properties or 62 percent of unregistered urban properties. 

CAS Outcome: Reductions in the time f o r registration of land transfers f rom 47 days to 10 days 
[Partially Achieved] 

Registration of land transfers is down from 47 days in 2005 to 30 days for properties not previously 
registered and 5-7 days for previously registered properties, in 2009'. A protracted, and later 

Doing Business data for 2010 show a reduction to only 42 days, but this is measured both with a lag and in the 
capital city only.

FY06-FY09 CAS Completion Resor t 

redesigned, procurement of information systems for the Immovable Properties Registration Office 
under the LAMP was been a major factor in the slow progress to date. 

CAS Outcome: Development of urban regulatory plans f o r Tirana and 8 key secondary cities 
[Partially Achieved] 

After a four-year-long process supported by a Bank-supervised trust fund from the Netherlands 
government, the new Tirana urban regulatory plan was completed in 2009. However, owing to 
protracted disputes between the national and municipal governments, it has not yet been approved nor, 
notably, has the consulting firm been paid for its services. Nevertheless, under the Land Administration 
and Management Project, after another protracted contracting process new regulatory planning 
exercises were launched and are underway for eight additional municipalities. 

CAS Outcome: 150 km of coastal zone with orderly land-use plans [Not Achieved] 

Following the adoption of the South Coast Development Plan and regulations, and as a result of an 
Inspection Panel case, Bank-support for preparation of land use plans in the southern coast of Albania 
has been cancelled. It is expected that the Government will continue with these planning exercises, but 
given the limited capacity in this area at both the national and local government levels, progress is 
expected to be relatively slower than it might have been with Bank involvement. 

CAS Outcome: Provision of key secondary cities with improved urban infrastructure [Partially 
Achieved] 

Under the Municipal Water and Wastewater Project (closed in 2009), the Integrated Water and 
Ecosystem Management Project (closed in 2009), and the Integrated Coastal Zone Management and 
Clean-up Project, the Bank supported significant improvements in water supply and investments in 
sewerage and wastewater treatment in Durres, Fier, Lezha, Himara and Saranda. Delays under the 
infrastructure component on the Land Administration and Management Project, meant that no 
infrastructure has been yet completed for the eight cities under the project. 

CAS Outcome: Provision of coastal communities with improved infrastructure to help support 
environmentally sustainable tourism [Achieved] 

Under the ICZMCP, three coastal municipalities and twelve coastal villages benefited from small 
infrastructure projects. These infrastructure improvements included several access roads to the beach or 
historical monuments (castle and monastery), repairing or extension of water supply systems and 
sewage water collection, as well parking places and rehabilitation or re-surfacing of village roads. 
Larger investments are ongoing to upgrade the passenger ferry terminal in Saranda port, construct a 
regional solid waste landfill in Saranda and transfer station in Himara, and a sewage and water supply 
extension within the tourist area in Saranda. 

1.6 
Country Development Goal: Support sustainable rural development to ensure continued 
economic poverty reduction 

Over the last decade rural poverty has declined steadily. While the national incidence of poverty fell 
from 18 percent in 2005 to 12.4 percent in 2008, in rural areas the reduction was almost twice as fast, 
falling from 24.2 to 14.6 percent. The depth and severity of poverty showed similar sustained declines. 
Extreme poverty in rural areas is now only around 1.2 percent. In the central rural and coastal rural 
areas, where the majority of the rural population is concentrated, poverty incidence has fallen to 11 

5 8 

FY06-FY09 CAS Corndetion Report 

percent (from 26 in 2005) and 15 percent (from 20 in 2005), respectively. Poverty still remains highest 
in the rural mountain areas, although it has declined from 50 to 30 percent between 2002-2005. 

The agricultural sector has been growing steadily in recent years but at lower rates than the overall 
economy. From 2000-08 it has grown at an average rate of 4 percent per year. 

The CAS program included several projects aimed at increasing rural incomes and productivity: Water 
Resource Management, Second Community Development, Fishery Development, Agricultural Services, 
but also the Natural Resources Development Project (see also Country Development Goal 2.4,) and 
more recently Secondary and Local Roads (see Pillar 1.4). 

CAS Outcomes: Crop yield increases of 45%, 70%, and 40%for maize, a v a v a , and vegetables in 
rehabilitated irrigation areas [Partially Achieved] 

The increases in crop yields were 42%, 55%, 23% for maize, alfalfa and vegetables. So, the targets are 
substantially achieved, with the exception of vegetables.’ 

CAS Outcomes: 100% of rehabilitated irrigation canals managed by user associations [Achieved] 

Under the Water Resources Management Project (closed in 2009) 36,000 ha of land was returned to 
irrigation compared with a target of 50,000 ha, and over 34,500 ha were drained. All of the 
rehabilitated channels are currently managed by either new pilot Water User Organizations o r the 
earlier established Water Unit Associations, with operating costs of about 44 percent of irrigation areas 
paid in full (at least $12 per hectare) by users. In addition, 33 dams and reservoirs were rehabilitated, 
exceeding the target of 13 under the project. The rehabilitated dams and reservoirs improved the 
irrigable land downstream by about 26,860 ha. 

CAS Outcomes: Increased supply of improved planting materials-25% 
basic seeds by research stations [Achieved] 

rise in multiplication of 

Under the Agricultural Services Project, an increased access to improved seed supplies and planting 
materials has taken place as measured by the number of varieties available and the increased 
availability of high quality seeds. The number of varieties tested and available in National seed 
catalogue are 81.48% of the farmers use certified seeds. There has been an increase in the local 
production of breeder seeds and a multiplication of basic seeds by seed research stations. The planned 
increases in the availability of seeddplanting materials per research station (Lushnja, Korca or Shkodra) 
and varieties established in the Agriculture Service Project have been reached in most cases. 

CAS Outcomes: Promotion of agricultural innovation - a t least 100 farmer groups witness 
productivity gains by use of new technology, diversification, or access to new markets (Achieved] 

Under the Agricultural Services Project, the Bank supported a competitive grants program which 
provided grants of up to US$15,000 to farmers for using new technologies and accessing new markets. 
Each recipient was also required to share these experiences through training, brochures and other 
methods with other farmers. One hundred thirty-four (136) farmer groups grant-financed projects were 
implemented and over 21,000 farmers were exposed to improved technology. Around 85 percent of the 
direct beneficiaries obtained increases in annual income, with 30 percent showing increases of greater 
than 10 percent. 

CAS Outcomes: Annual increases of 20% in volume and diversity of goods traded in constructed 
markets [Achieved] 

Data reported in the CAS Progress Report erroneously referred to the pilot water users organizations, only. 

59 

FY06-FY09 CAS Completion Report 

The volume of trade in the four completed markets" in Korca, Lushnja, Vlora and Shkodra increased 
by more than 200 percent from an average of 50 tons per day in 2004 to 122 tons in 2008. The number 
of traders increased by 60 percent; the number of farmers by 700 percent; contracted covered stores 
reached 87 percent. The diversity of agricultural products traded increased from an average of 5 product 
varieties in 2004 to 28 in 2008. 

CAS Outcomes: Increase in sustainable marine and inlandfisk catch [Achieved] 
The size and associated value of the marine fish catch has grown systematically from 2004 to 2008 -- at 
an average increase in value of US$1.2 million per annum -- supported by the Bank through a Fishery 
Development Project (closed in 2007). Four marine ports (Saranda, Vlora, Shengjin and Durres) were 
rehabilitated and are being managed by community-based fishermen's associations. Rehabilitation of 
three lake fish landing sites was completed, but the ones on Lakes Ohrid and Shkodra are not yet self- 
financing. Increased capacity for aquaculture development has been pursued: carp fingerlings (Koran at 
Lake Ohrid) are released yearly; estimated lake catch increased by 30%, and lake productivity increased 
threefold. A total of 1,482 individuals, representing vessel owners and fishery workers, and in-land 
fishermen are registered as members of 13 Fishery Management Organizations. Training at the 
Shkodra Lake was completed and improved surveillance takes place with the introduction of vessel- 
tracking systems linked with coast guards. 

PILLAR 2: Improved Service Delivery, particularly in the Social Sectors 
Country Development Goal: Improved quality of, and equity in a c c e ~ s to, education 

2.1 

sewices 

Overall progress toward this country goal was modest over the CAS period, but perceptible. The Bank 
has contributed to this goal through Albania's first SWAP project - the Education, Excellence and 
Equity Project, which was mainstreamed into the Ministry of Education. The project has had some 
delays but is associated with a number of institutional developments across the sector. 

Administrative data show that between 2005 and 2009 enrolment rates at every level increased, e.g., 
from 48 to 50 percent in early childhood development services, from 54 to 60 percent in secondary 
education (project target is 75 percent), and by more than 20 percent for higher education. The 
standard deviation of per student expenditure in pre-university education across regions has declined 
from 4,435 Lek in 2005 to 2,388 Lek in 2009, but rural secondary enrolment rates remains less than 
one-third of urban. Rural students also perform worse than their urban peers, scoring on average 7 
points less on the Matura literature exam, for example. 

* 

Learning conditions have been improving - particularly the problem of over-crowding. The share of 
students in multiple-shift classrooms fell from 34.5 to 17.7 percent in primary schools and from 7.7 to 
5.7 in secondary schools. School infrastructure planning and investments under the Education 
Excellence and Equity Project, albeit delayed, should help to further to decreasing over-crowding. 

New curricula have been introduced in basic and secondary education. The latter has started on a 
rolling basis, is modular and allows greater choice of content. New textbooks have been developed and 
distributed in support of this curriculum and teachers have been familiarized with the new materials. 
An Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) curriculum was introduced in 2009, all ICT 
teachers have been trained, and over 2000 basic and secondary schools have been equipped with 
computer labs. The students per computer ratio fell from 61 in 2005 to 25 in 2009, while in rural areas it

Under the Agricultural Services Project, the Bank initiated financing of a fifth market with project savings, but 
the project was closed before its completion, owing to delays and governance issues. 

60 

FY06-FY09 CAS Completion Report 

has improved even more dramatically from 148 into 27. However, more progress is needed with respect 
to strengthening digital libraries and e-schools. 

At the higher education level, the project is supporting a management/governance reform effort under 
which all of the public universities have established public boards and 70 percent have prepared new 
strategic plans. 

CAS Outcome: Net secondary enrollment increases f r om 53% in 2005 to 72% in 2009 [Partially 
Achieved] 

The net secondary enrollment rate increased from 53 percent in 2005 to 60 percent in 2009. However, 
this indicator may understate the improvement for several reasons. First, the school system was 
changed in 2008 from 8 years of basic and 4 years of secondary, to 9 and 3 years, respectively. As a 
result the number of secondary classrooms increased by 25 percent, and the improved conditions are 
reported to have encouraged some further enrollment: 11 percent more secondary students were 
graduated in 2009 than 2008. Second, population projections may not have captured the rapid 
demographic movements in recent years. Concerns remain about the rural areas, where enrollment 
remained at 26 percent in 2009 (the target is 32 percent) compared with 88 percent in urban areas 
(exceeding that target by 3 percent). 

CAS Outcome: Completion of curriculum reform in basic education by 2008 [Achieved] 

Since 2008, all basic schools are implementing a new 9-grade curriculum, for which students have the 
relevant textbooks and teachers have been trained. 

CAS Outcome: Completion of curriculum reform in secondary education by 2010 [Achieved] 

The new curriculum for the first grade of secondary education has been approved and is being 
implemented during the 2009-20 10 school year. The curriculum reform for second and thirds grades of 
secondary school has been launched in 2009 and the new curricula will be implemented in 2010-1 1, and 
201 1-12, respectively. 

CAS Outcome: 15% of schools with functioning school boards and school improvement plans by 
2009 [Achieved] 

In 2008, Albania introduced school boards in all of its 2,015 schools. To date, about 400 of these 
school boards (20 percent) have developed school improvement plans. 

CAS Outcome: Standard deviation of per capita student expenditures by regions reduced f rom 4,000 
Lek to 3,000 Lek by 2009 [Achieved] 

By end 2008, the standard deviation of per student expenditure in pre-university education was 2,238 
Lek. 

Albania’s health indicators show improvement, although they remain low for a lower middle income 
country. The estimated infant mortality rate for Albania is 10.3 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2009 
compared with 15.1 in 2004. The MDG for 2005 was 14.7. The maternal mortality rate is estimated at 
0 deaths in 2009, compared with 16.7 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2006 and 21.3 deaths in 2003. 
However, the Bank contribution to this goal through the Health System Modernization Project has been 
limited to institutional and capacity improvements outlined below, owing to delays in 
its 
implementation. The 2006 PEIR indicated that although public health expenditures remain low, critical 
improvements in the health financing and spending mechanisms were recommended to precede any 

61

increase in public financing. This study informed the design of the Health Sector Management Project 
(HSMP) to focus on quality and efficiency improvements as a first step. Nevertheless, in some regions, 
access to essential hospital services has improved due to investments in road infrastructure, notably in 
Vlora and Shkodra under the Road Maintenance Project. It is expected that such improvements will 
continue with the Secondary and Local Roads program which has as one of the investment allocation 
criteria, travelling time for local communities to schools and hospitals. Under the Bank financed 
emergency Avian Influenza Project, Albania benefited from improvements in diagnostic capacity at the 
Institute of Public Health, and the regular vaccination of at-risk populations against the seasonal 
influenza. 

CAS Outcome: Allocation of public funding based on health needs and primary care providers- 
target: establishment of performance contracts with 5 hospitals by 2009 [Partially Achieved] 
The Health Insurance Institute (HII) assumed responsibility for funding all operating costs for primary 
health care in 2000. The financing arrangements with primary health care providers include 
performance incentives. In addition, since 2009, the HI1 has taken over the responsibility of funding all 
hospitals as well. Currently contracts are in place between HI1 and the hospitals, but performance 
incentives are not yet being implemented. Meanwhile, steps are being taken to improve health sector 
management and governance, with a view of allowing health care providers more autonomy in resource 
allocation and decision-making. University training of 12 trainers has been completed in hospital 
management and financial management. These trainers have successfully completed training of 150 
health system managers while training of other 100 managers is under implementation. 

CAS Outcome: Establishment of formal co-payment system yielding 20% reduction in reported 
in formal payments in target regions by 2009 [Partially Achieved] 

A modern legislative framework for health financing is being introduced. As a related and necessary 
step, the new Health Care Law was adopted in 2009 replacing a 1967 law on the books. This new law 
includes a system for physician licensing and private health care provision. The Government has 
introduced co-payments for prescription drugs for all beneficiaries, established a more controlled list of 
drugs eligible for coverage, and revised its policy to limit reimbursement to drugs that have similar 
therapeutic effects and are the cheapest available. Results of the Living Standards Measurement Study 
(LSMS) on co-payments or informal payments are forthcoming, but sector experts surmise that the 20 
percent reduction has not yet been achieved. 

CAS Outcome: Improved quality of health care services through use of evidence-based Clinical 
Practice Guidelines (CPGs) in 32 key diseases [Partially Achieved] 

The institutional framework has been established for development of CPG. After careful analysis of the 
disease pattern in Albania, it was agreed that the target of developing CPGs for 32 diseases was not 
appropriate, and that it was more important to focus only on six key diseases. So far, CPGs for five key 
diseases have been developed and are currently under implementation, while work is in progress for the 
sixth one. Training is being provided to practitioners with the objective of reaching 70 % compliance 
with CPGs by end 20 10. 

CAS Outcome: Complete training of 100% Primary Health Care physicians and nurses in 7 regions 
by 2009 [Achieved] 

The quality improvement training for primary care providers is under implementation. So far, all 
primary health care physicians and nurses have been trained in 6 regions, while work is in progress for 
the remaining 6 regions in the country. The licensing system with basic requirements for all health care 
institutions and professionals has been established. The objective is that all physicians are licensed 

62 

FY06-FY09 CAS Corndetion ReDort 

based on licensing guidelines. About 210 staff members have been trained and the licensing and 
accreditation function is already integrated into the Center for Quality and Accreditation.

Country Development G Q ~ : Improve provision of social security and assistance services 
and their sustainability 

Improvement in selected areas has taken place. While some measures, including reduction of payroll 
contributions from 39 to 24 percent and reduction of fraud leading to lower expenditures, were 
undertaken the remaining reforms needed to secure fiscal sustainability have yet to be agreed or 
initiated. Moreover, the Government has continued with ad hoc pension increases that limit the future 
space for reform. On the other hand, significant progress has been made in social assistance and social 
services, supported by the Social Services Delivery Project (SSDP). The national strategy for social 
services and assistance was prepared and is under implementation. New national service standards for 
all vulnerable groups were produced and are being implemented. The number of recipient of these 
social care services has increased more than ten-fold. Local governments have assumed full financial 
responsibility for and are replicating the social care centers established under SSDP. An assessment of 
the factors underlying targeting performance indicates that much is owed to the efforts of local officials 
to reach their poor, except in rural areas where the efforts of the center and local officials contribute 
equally. In the Government’s main social assistance program NE a large share of the benefits is still 
captured by wealthier households, and the NE benefits represent a modest share of the total pre-transfer 
consumption of the poor because the NE benefits are low, due to limited funding. Major improvements 
are needed to improve targeting. The Government has plans for a major overhaul of the social 
assistance system which will be supported under the new CPS. The main focus of the reform 
potentially would include the improvement in eligibility criteria, administration of benefits, monitoring 
and evaluation, and the computerization of the system. 

CAS Outcomes: Improved delivery of social care services through (a) a 50% increase in access of 
vulnerable groups to effective social care services in at least 8 regions, and (b) 70% of social care 
services in selected regions to meet their performance targets by 2009 [Achieved] 

There has been a substantial increase in the access of vulnerable groups to daily social care services. A 
total of 43 daily care centers are in place in 8 regions, established under the SSDP, servicing almost 
25,000 persons (directly and indirectly). This should be compared with 26 centers servicing 1,300 
persons in 2000. The quality of care in residential services has been increased with 19 out of 26 
residential care centers (73 percent) provide services in accordance with standards of social care and/or 
specific standards for elderly and disabled. 

CAS Outcomes: Improvements in targeted cash transfers f o r social assistance: (a) at least 30% of 
poor households receive cash social assistance, and (b) 90% of social assistance goes to poor 
households [Partially Achieved] 

There has been some progress regarding public policy planning which has been translated into policy 
making and outcomes. Options for improved targeting for cash social assistance have been identified 
and appraised. A national strategy on the NE is completed and approved by the Government. LSMS 
2008 results show that over 30 percent of the poor households currently receive NE assistance but no 
data is yet available to confirm that 90 percent of social assistance goes to poor households. 

CAS Outcomes: Adoption of a pension policy and administrative reform program to achieve fiscal 
sustainability [Partially Achieved] 

Some achievements have been made in pension administration but no policy reform proposal or 
strategy has yet been agreed by Government. Bank support to pension reforms and administrative 
improvements has been channeled through the SSDP and the DPO reform program. Although a policy 

63 

FY06-FY09 CAS Completion Report 

option paper was completed and adopted by the Strategic Planning Committee, there were significant 
delays in the formation of the pension policy working group to develop more specific reform proposals. 
The working group was subsequently expanded to include members of opposition parties in recognition 
that a broad-based consensus on the objectives and specific reforms is critical. However, its work was 
halted by the 2009 elections and has yet to be revitalized. Meanwhile, the Social Insurance Institute has 
moved to reduce fraud by securing records and improving the registration of contributions. With Bank 
support, the Social Insurance Institute is refurbishing and expanding its archives and has started the 
digitalization of its records. The Bank has also supported, with TA, revisions of the legal framework 
for the voluntary pension system in 2009.

Coun try Development Goal: Poverty reduction through incame increases and improved 
serv ice delivery in both urban and rural areas 

The period 2005-08 witnessed a particularly strong reduction of poverty, with the incidence declining 
from 24.2 to 14.6 percent. 
At the same time extreme poverty has fallen to 1.2 percent. 
These 
reductions are in line with the goal of lowering poverty incidence to 10 percent and eradicating extreme 
poverty by 201 5. While the majority of the poor still live in rural areas, that share has fallen from 68 
percent to 60 percent between 2002 and 2008. There are however emerging tiny pockets of extreme 
urban poverty with rates higher than in some rural areas. 

The CAS program has contributed to improving infrastructural service delivery and incomes through 
projects supporting municipal water and wastewater, forestry, community works, municipal and coastal 
infrastructure. Good progress on water and sanitation has been made during the CAS period. The share 
of the population connected to the piped water network is around 74 percent (87 percent in urban 
municipalities and 47 percent in the rural communes). The corresponding coverage of sewerage is only 
47 percent (68 percent in municipalities but only 3 percent in the rural communes). Improvements in 
the rural and peri-urban infrastructure are taking place, and the Government's objective to reach 45 
percent of the population with access to waste water treatment by 2013 seems feasible. Clarification of 
responsibilities across agencies and communities for provision and maintenance of rural transport 
infrastructure is in progress under the ongoing Secondary and Local Roads Project with Bank financing. 

CAS Outcomes: Improved access to and quality of urban water supply for 300,000people in Durres, 
Saranda, Fier, and Lezhe [Achieved] 

Through the Municipal Water and Waste Water Project, the Bank assisted Albania to improve water 
and sanitation services in four participating cities and achieve financial viability. A new incentive-based 
multi-city management contract approach was introduced. Participating water utilities engaged a private 
operator through management contract to take over operation and maintenance of existing facilities. 
Water availability increased in participating municipalities: the average hours increase 2-3 times in 
most cases (availability is between 3 and 20 hours per day, depending on the municipality). Percentage 
of total connected population in service area receiving at minimum 2 hours of water supply per day is 
about 100 percent in these cities. Collection rates are between 56 and 8 1 percent, which requires further 
improvement although it is much better than in the past. Wastage and over-consumption of water has 
been reduced. This has had a positive impact on the finances of the public utilities. Management of the 
broader water and waste water sector is improving. All 54 water and waste water utilities are monitored 
on a monthly basis. A Monitoring and Benchmarking Unit (within Government) issues six-monthly and 
annual reports. 

CAS Outcomes: Improved access to urban sanitation in Saranda municipality and wastewater 
treatment in Durres, Saranda, and Lezhe/Shengjin [Partially Achieved] 
The Bank contributed to these CAS outcomes through the Global Environment Project for Integrated 
Water and Ecosystem Management (US$Smillion) which twinned with EIB to support the development 
of three large sewerage treatment plants in the three coastal areas. The project closed with an 

64 

FY06-FY09 CAS Completion Repor t 

unsatisfactory rating in December 2009, because the plants have yet to be complete owing to delays in 
Government counterpart financing for EIB co-financing and EC parallel financing. Nevertheless it is 
anticipated that by mid 201 1 , through this support, Albania will have significantly increased the 
coverage of wastewater treatment in these environmentally and economically critical coastal areas. 

CAS Outcomes: Local community management of 660,000 ha of upland erosion-prone land using 
sustainable natural resource management plans (Achieved] 

With Bank, GEF and Swedish Government assistance under the Natural Resources Development 
Project (NRDP), the participatory communal forest and pasture management plans (which include 
defined, agreed and mapped usufruct rights) have been introduced in 250 communes that cover 644,739 
ha. To support this measure, the Government transferred in 2008, ownership of 60 percent of country’s 
forest and pasture lands or 754,148 ha to local governments. Erosion reduction measures have been 
established; erosion reduction is estimated at 150,000 tons to date. The target for the year 2010 is to 
reduce erosion by 200,000 ton, which is likely to be achieved given that implementation of micro- 
catchment plans is ongoing in 30 communes and forest and management plans in 190 communes. 

CAS Outcomes: 10% increase in economic benefits f rom sustainable use of natural resources at the 
contmune or village level (Achieved] 

The implementation of the plans financed under NRDP provides much needed seasonal employment 
opportunities to the rural poor, involving some 6000 workers, including 1900 women and 1900 
beneficiary families, fi-om Project start up to the present time. Preliminary assessment shows a 41 
percent increase in average annual household income derived from sustainable use of forest and 
pasture resources. Another promising result relates to the fact that communes started establishing 
grazing fees from January 2009. The Project is also supporting carbon sequestration measures in 
degraded lands through tree planting, assisted natural regeneration and control of animal grazing in 24 
communes (6272.36 ha ) that are among the poorest in the country, with a median poverty rate of 42 
percent. Almost two-thirds of them rank in the lowest third of the poverty distribution as measured by 
“percent families poor”. 

World Bank portfolio performance 

A s of end-December 2009, there were 15 active projects with an average size of US$18 million, and 
original commitment of $268 million in the Albania portfolio. This does not include an additional 
US$78 million Partial Risk Guarantee for the electricity distribution privatization. Since the beginning 
of the CAS period, eleven other projects (including a GEF and DPL) were completed. The total 
commitment during the CAS period was US$400 million for 25 projects with an average size of US$16 
mi 11 ion. 

A s of end December 2009, 78 percent of the commitments on the ongoing portfolio have satisfactory 
performance. Two projects in the transport sector are rated as highly satisfactory, four others as 
satisfactory, and six as moderately satisfactory, on implementation performance. All three projects 
which are rated unsatisfactory have recently been restructured. As such, proactivity over the CPS 
period was 100 percent. Eighty-six ( 8 6 ) percent of the completed commitments were rated satisfactory 
or moderately satisfactory. Of the ten completed projects, two were rated unsatisfactory, three 

moderately satisfactory and five satisfactory.

l 2 As part of this operation, Albania is the first country in Eastern Europe to contract a loan for entry into the 
Climate Change Risk Insurance Facility, and was an early demander for the Catastrophic Deferred Drawdown 
Operation, until the exposure rules were changed which made this contingent financing a much less attractive 
lending instrument.

There is little evidence of reduced demand f o r Bank lending in view of the graduation f r om IDA in 
2009. But, a s expected, technical assistance components are more carefully scrutinized by the 
authorities, and the Bank has been encouraged to partner with the remaining concessional windows 
available t o Albania. In this regard, 7 of the 10 new load c r ed i td3 committed in the CAS benefit f r om 
substantial eo-financing or coordinated parallel financing. The most notable are the Sector Wide 
Approach Program in the education sector (Bank financing is one-fifth o f a US$75 million sector 
program) and the Secondary and Local Roads Project (Bank-financed project of US$20 million has 
triggered a program of nearing US$350 million in parallel financing). 

Esforts to consolidate the portfolio toward the CAS target of 12 projects were delayed by the 
continued high demand in the fa c e of a gradually closing window f o r IDA resources, and addition o f 
two small projects related to global and regional public goods (namely Avian Influenza and Disaster 
Risk Mitigation and Adaptation Program). However, the current portfolio of 1 5 projects averaging $1 8 
million continued the trend toward larger projects. I t compares with the portfolio a t the onset of the 
2002 CAS which had 21 projects averaging US$13 million, and in 2005 with 1 5 projects averaging 
US$15 million. 

The country program also included 26 trust funds and one Fee-Based Service during the CAS period, 
including several grant co-financing trust funds for projects and the Japan Policy and Human Resources 
Development Fund (PHRD) preparation grants. This does not include full sized Global Environmental 
Projects, o f which Albania has benefited from three during the CAS period (one is now closed). O f 
these 16 are ongoing, o f which 1 1 are project co-financing grants, 
The average age of projects in portfolio is 4.5 years, slightly higher than the Bank and ECA at 3.7, 
3.8 years, respectively. There are two significantly older projects. The Social Service Delivery Project, 
a t 8.6 years, was extended from its original 6 year implementation period to utilize cost savings and 
later additional financing for investments in pension administration. The Power Sector Generation and 
Restructuring Project is 5.8 years but is expected to close in the next few months. 
The disbursement rate in the CASpe r iod , and as well in FY09, was 21 percent, compared with 18-19 
percent in Europe and Central Asia and 24-27 percent Bank-wide. Disbursement rates fluctuated 
during the CAS period, but have on average remained rather low, reflecting in part delays associated 
with the mainstreaming o f project implementation into line ministries forgoing the use o f free-standing 
PIUS, - (Education, Health, Natural Resources, and Business Environment), and several protracted 
procurement for larger contracts, such a s for transmission substations, regulatory impact assessment 
TA, and computerization for property registry office and health information system.

The completion cost of loans/credits has declined during the CPS period, f r om $422,000 p e r 
operation in FY06 to $348,000 in FY09I4. Together with the increasing average loadc red i t size and 
projecUprogram size, this suggests an increasing efficiency in the delivery of the lending program. 

l 3 Not including the SSDP Additional Financing and the Partial Risk Guarantee 
l 4 The information refers to “completion costs”, that is cumulative costs of operations approved in the referred 
years, including expenditures incurred in previous years. Therefore this cost refers to projects delivered 
during the CAS period and not to all projects under implementation. The same criteria were used for AAAs. 

67 

FY06-FY09 CAS Comp le t ion Revort 

However, the average cost $382,000 to deliver a loadcredit during the CAS period was 40 percent over 
the regional reference cost or ?coefficient?, mainly on account of five high cost deliveries DPL 11, 
Transport, LAMP, BERIS, HSMP, and EEEP. The Bank spent around $86,000 per project in 
supervision during this CAS period, close to the reference point. A decision was taken mid CAS period 
to allocate more resources to more complex or riskier projects such as the EEEP, ICZMCP and LAMP. 
Meanwhile, decentralization which led to local task team leadership of seven of the 25 projects covered 
during the CAS period and helped to contain costs. The costs of analytical and advisory activities 
(AAA) were more irregular. The average cost of an AAA task was $150,000, exceeding the 
?coefficient? or reference by 25 percent. Finally, ?overhead? costs (?other) as a proportion of the 
annual budget for delivering the Albania CAS program have been increasing in relative terms: it went 
from about 12 percent in FY06 to about 22 percent in FY08 and FY0915. The overall budget is 
contracting faster than ?other? costs. In any case, an ?overhead? cost of over 20 percent seems on the 
high side and needs to be examined. 

Mainstreaming project implementation. 

Under the CAS, the Bank continued to mainstream project implementation into line ministry 
structures though this sometimes caused temporary delays as ministry staff coped with unfamiliar 
Bankprocedures.. While this effort has helped to build capacity in line ministries - notably, Ministries 
of Finance, Education and Economy, Trade & Energy, Public Works - and in KESH, in many cases it 
resulted in a slowing of project disbursements as ministry staff struggled to meet additional burden of 
project administration. The most notable examples are in the Education SWAP, the Health Sector 
Modernization Project, Land Administration and Management Project, Business Environment Reform 
and Institutional Support Project and the Disaster Risk Mitigation and Adaptation Project. 

From the Bank side, project design often did not take into sufficient account the challenges of 
mainstreaming. The most notable case is in Health Sector Modernization Project where the original 
procurement plan included a very large number of small packages whose processing was being 
mainstreamed into a ministry with traditionally weak capacity. In Ministry of Education (Education 
Excellence and Equity Project) and the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Energy (Business Environment 
Reform and Institutional Strengthening Project) the plethora of administrative steps in ministry decision 
making apparatus ultimately led to the Bank making recommendations on the client?s own procedural 
functions to ease project implementation. Another case is that of the LAMP which is being 
implemented across three ministries, where the project encountered the perennial problem of inter- 
ministerial coordination which is not yet firmly embedded in Albanian public administration. One 
lesson is that, in addition, to fiduciary assessments, the Bank might require a much more integrated 
assessment of functional and administrative capacities in beneficiary agencies where project 
implementation is to be mainstreamed. 

In the still politicized public sector, mainstreaming also meant that projects were vulnerable to the 
high turnover of public officials; again Ministry of Health is a notable example where the minister has 
been changed five times, to date, during project implementation, but similar situations also took place in 
KESH, Ministry of Public Works, and Ministry of Education. While it is near impossible to anticipate 
such changes, measures might be taken during supervision to ensure that a broad swath of ministry staff 
understand the project in some detail. 

Notwithstanding the above, the benefits of mainstreaming are clearly apparent. In the energy and 
roads sectors, long engagement with Bank-financed projects and strong donor coordination, has led to 
the establishment of Government-staffed project implementation structures that are familiar with donor 
requirements and efficiently implement multiple donor programs. This includes the joint project unit in 
KESH, the General Roads Directorate in the Ministry of Public Works, the Albanian Development 

l 5 This is based on annual spending, which is not the same a s the spending based on completion costs. 

68 

Fund, and Central Financing and Contracting Unit in the Ministry o f Finance. Even in other ministries 
where the number of donor-financed projects is few, such a s Ministries o f Education and Economy, a 
recent Bank fiduciary review suggests that ministries have internalized some of the disciplines of Bank 
project procedures. 

FY06-FY09 CAS Comp le t ion Reuort 

Improving governance 
To strengthen Albania’s weak governance - a critical development constraint -- the CAS foresaw two 
main instruments: ( i ) systematic application of a governance f i l te r ; and (ii) implementation of a set 
of fiduciary measures. The governance filter approach specified key governance areas relevant for 
Albania and aimed at mainstreaming them, i.e. ensuring that all CAS interventions included a specific 
focus on one o r more of them. Most o f the projects approved after the CAS16 had been discussed a t the 
Board included explicit commitments to the application o f the Filter, while in older projects, the Filter 
served to reemphasize the importance o f components dealing with governance and institutional 
development. This approach is currently being evaluated, inter alia, in a Governance Review which is 
currently under preparation. The second instrument was a set o f fiduciary measures geared to protect 
Bank-financed projects but also t o support the development o f better country fiduciary systems. The 
latter has since blossomed into a Fiduciary Action Plan, currently being implemented with support from 
the Governance Partnership Facility. In terms of the various pillars o f the Filter, Box 2 of the CAS 
Progress Report summarizes most o f the interventions up to that time. Since then, Albania has 
benefitted a s a CGAC country from some additional resources in FY08 used for starting 
implementation on the Fiduciary Action Plan, training media, civil society and watchdog institutions on 
governance indicators, procurement system reform and some sectoral interventions. Albania now has a 
Bank-executed Governance Partnership Facility Window 1 program under implementation - which 
focuses on more thorough governance diagnostics at the macro and micro level, implementation of the 
Fiduciary Action Plan (mentioned above) and increasing interactions with civil society including in 
project supervision. 

Box 1: Albania’s protracted Treasury system development and its impact on the portfolio 
The development of the Albania treasury system under the Public Administration Reform Project was 
first under prepared during project design when a belated decision to introduce this component was 
agreed. The subproject subsequently ran into implementation delays on account of the lack o f 
preparation and in particular client readiness. After several design changes, the system became 
operational in the first half o f 2007, ju s t after the project closed. IEG’s Project Evaluation notes “The 
Treasury Department is currently running the system in parallel with the previous system, and the full 
operation is planned from January 2008. The implementation of the system is at a critical juncture.” In 
anticipation o f full operation, the Bank agreed to financial reporting o f a number o f new projects in this 
CAS through the Treasury system, provided additional support from local Financial Management 
officer and later through it supervision o f the IPS Trust Fund. Today in by early 2010, full operation o f 
the system has not yet been achieved. Meanwhile, delays in financial reporting have contributed to 
disbursement levels in a number o f the Bank-financed projects which rely on the system. With 
hindsight, a few lessons are important to note. First, four-year implementation period for automation 
was too limited for a complex automation of this type. Second, although portfolio management dictated 
the on-time closure of the project, it may have been better for the Bank t o extend its support for some 
months t o help the Government ensure full operation o f the system. Third, the impact o f the client’s 
lack o f readiness to undertake such a project at the onset has persisted beyond the project closure. 

The fiduciary commitments under this CAS included decentralization o f financial management and 
procurement staff; adjusting procurement thresholds to better reflect country risk; more procurement

audits and reviews; continuing support to audit and procurement agencies; and vigorously investigating 
fraud. For most of the CAS period local FM and procurement staff were in place”. A recent Country 
Fiduciary Review reports that (i) as a result of these actions, there has been a much closer degree of 
scrutiny and ‘hand-holding’ of the Albania portfolio that is seen across the ECA region; (ii) this more 
intensive supervision effort associated with local staffing and lower prior review thresholds has paid off 
in terms of governance and capacity building- a number of good/best practices by contracting agencies 
were identified, and (ii) fiduciary staff decentralization helped to contain the costs of this more 
intensive supervision. Some lessons include the need to now improve contract management and to 
share lessons/information across government. The added advantage of local fiduciary presence was the 
ability to keep up the dialogue on the broader fiduciary reform agenda, in particular on Treasury system 
development, procurement, and accounting and audit reform. 

Safeguards policy implementation 

During the CAS period, two Inspection Panel cases were investigated in Albania which yielded some 
important lessons f o r project implementation as a whole. Investigations were undertaken on the 
Integrated Coastal Zone Management and Clean-up Project and the Power Sector Generation and 
Restructuring Project (“Vlore Power Plant”). In both cases, the findings of the Panel focused on 
implementation of safeguard policies on (environment and resettlement). The main lessons from the 
ICZMCP panel case pertain mainly to managerial and staffing issues, including that of carefully 
matching team leadershipkomposition as well as the level of managerial oversight to project 
complexity and risk, and of maintaining an environment conducive to frank discussion and resolution of 
risks. However, in both cases, there are some lessons for program implementation, namely: 
the need to raise the importance of safeguards implementation to the same level already afforded 
to fiduciary controls in project preparation and implementation. 
the role of the Bank in supervising the quality of consultations undertaken by the client in project 
preparation and implementation; 
the need for a renewed focus on social risks in Albania, in particular with respect to land and 
property rights which remain an area of contention; 
the need to fully explain the Bank’s policies, in particular on social risk mitigation, not only to 
senior officials but all levels of project staffing especially in mainstreamed projects; 
the need to continuously update the Bank’s knowledge of local laws and regulations when it 
pertains to implementation of safeguard policies, both environmental and otherwise; 
the importance of systematically addressing complaints from the public, including through a 
proactive media and communications program that mitigates reputational risks; and 
in small countries such as Albania to pay close attention to either perceived or actual conflict of 
interests in project staffing. 

Analytical and Advisory Services 

The CAS lending program was accompanied by a substantial program of analytical and advisory 
services and non-lending technical assistance from both the Bank and IFC. Overall the products were 
well aligned with country and CAS goals. Several key economic and sector work products were 
important forerunners to key lending operations and reform dialogues - notably

2009, 

0 work on concessions in which IFC supported the development of the new law, and two 
instances of its implementation in the concessioning of the Ashta hydropower plant and the 
planned concession of the Durres container terminal; and 

the Mining Sector Reform, Restructuring and Future Support which started as short mission 
in response to a request from Government, and has yielded Albania’s candidacy for the 
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. 

The most recent AAA work is relevant to deal with the aftermath of the global crisis, namely the CEM, 
Investment Climate Assessment (with a focus on innovation) and Social Policy technical assistance. 
Finally there has been continuous flow of analysis and technical assistance on fiduciary agenda, ROSC 
accounting and audit, corporate governance and alternative dispute resolution (ADR), a Governance 
Review and study on accountability in the social sectors to help further refine the governance agenda in 
the future. 

IFC and World Bank activities strategically complemented each other particularly in the energy 
sector and in private sector development. As of April 2009, IFC committed portfolio in Albania was 
US$81.7 million, allocated to the general manufacturing sector (98 percent) and the financial sector (2 
percent). During FY07-09, IFC has financed 5 projects for a total of US$96.5 million as compared to 
US$76.9 million in 3 projects during FY04-06. IFC’s main strategic objective during FY06-09 was to

ANNEX 3: RESULTS OF 2009/10 ALBANIA CL IENT SURVEY 

In February 201 0, World Bank stakeholders were asked to participate in a Country Survey, to assess their 
views of the World Bank and its work in Albania. The survey was sent to a range of opinion leaders, 
including government, civil society, NGOs, media, private sector, and academia. A total of 200 
stakeholders responded - a 73 percent response rate. 

Overall the Client Survey suggests that stakeholders are quite satisfied with the Bank’s work in Albania, 
and the relationships they have with the Bank (see Survey Question B2 graph below). They expressed 
positive views of the Bank’s relevance, its alignment with country development priorities, and the way it 
works in the country. Slightly more than half of respondents reported that the Bank should be more 
involved in Albania’s development strategies while 44% said that the Bank was currently involved at an 
optimum level. Finally stakeholders from all groups were quite positive about the Bank’s overall 
effectiveness in Albania. 

A number of important survey findings emerged that the country team has considered in the new CPS. 
These include: 

In terms of the work it is doing, the Bank is perceived by respondents to be focused on the areas that they 
consider top priority, for the most part. The survey findings indicate that stakeholders are concerned 
deeply with issues related to law, justice and governance, and a plurality believes that private sector 
growth is the key to economic growth. The survey findings suggest that the Bank’s overall strategic 
focus in Albania - identified by respondents as primarily poverty, growth, government effectiveness, 
infrastructure - is fairly well aligned with what stakeholders think the Bank should be focused on: 
economic growth, property rights, education, governance (see Survey Question C2b, below). 

Other sectoral priorities identified by respondents include agricultural development, preparation for EU 
membership, environmental impact of World Bank programs and helping to safeguard against corruption 
in Bank programs (all of which receive relatively positive ratings in terms of Bank effectiveness). While 
ratings on the Bank’s support for education and private sector are not terribly low, the Bank’s work in 
these areas is not perceived as positively as its work in other sectors. This is of note because of 
stakeholders’ interest in these sectors, in terms of overall development in Albania. 

In terms of its outreach and relationships, the survey findings suggest that the Bank should work more 
with local government and the private sector (see Survey Question C7, below). The latter group is of note 
when considering the view expressed strongly in the survey that private sector growth is critical to overall 
economic growth in Albania. This stakeholder group is significantly less familiar with the Bank than 
nearly all other audiences; this may be an important area for greater collaboration with the IFC. 

Stakeholders expressed concern in the survey about public disclosure. When asked what the Bank’s 
greatest weakness was in Albania, a plurality of respondents reported that the Bank does not provide 
enough public disclosure of its work with the government. This may reflect an overall concern with 
transparency. 

Nearly fifty percent of respondents reported that they had used the Public Information Center in Tirana. 
This far exceeds use of PICS in most countries surveyed, even with a reported nearly 100% internet 
access. Nine out of ten respondents said they had used the World Bank website (more use the local 
website than the corporate website) with a high level of satisfaction reported.

ANNEX 4: STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS ON THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 

CPS Preparation Steps. As early as June 2009, IFC hosted the Bank and IFC country teams at a 2-day 
workshop in Istanbul, facilitated by the IDA-IFC Secretariat, to brainstorm about possible cooperation in 
a variety of infrastructure and social service sectors as well as on work on the business environment. The 
workshop was followed by a country team meeting in September 2009 in Albania. 

The formal process of consultation with the Government was launched in January 20 10 with a workshop 
chaired by the Ministry of Finance and the Department of Strategy and Donor Coordination (DSDC) at 
which line ministries presented their proposal for future support. This was then followed by discussions 
with the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers, led on the Bank’s side by the Regional Vice 
President. These meetings were followed by another round of discussions with the line ministries, prior 
to the beginning the internal CPS drafting and processing steps. 

Following another round of meetings with the line ministries, the Ministry of Finance, DSDC and the 
Office of the Prime Minister, broader stakeholder consultations were also held with the Parliament 
through its Committee on Economy and Finance (which includes opposition members), the central bank, 
representatives of the private sector and civil society, and external development partners. The 
consultations provided a venue for meaningful discussions with stakeholders on the content of the 
proposed CPS program, the modalities for development interventions in Albania, and, especially, the role 
of the Bank in supporting improvements in governance and transparency. 

Feedback f r om Consultations. The main feedback from the Parliamentary Commission on Economy and 
Finance was related to the design of conditionality for budget support which Commission Members felt 
should be very focused on a few key issues. In addition, several members suggested that the Bank focus 
in depth on macroeconomic policy (particularly in the absence of a Fund program and local presence) and 
regularly publish analytic reviews on macroeconomic performance. The need for a more focused and 
consolidated World Bank Group program was also a key theme sounded by Commission Members, who 
expressed concerns about the slow rate of project implementation. 

Civil society continued to challenge the Bank to foster more public debate on governance, 
macroeconomic issues as well as broader development concerns. Representatives also suggested a more 
cross-sectoral approach in addressing key challenges, e.g. the impact of transport on school enrolment or 
the role of forestry management on mountain area poverty. Representatives from environmental 
organizations welcomed the focus on addressing climate challenges, but warned that without greater 
investment in solid waste management Albania stood to permanently damage its natural heritage. The 
civil society welcomed the new Access to Information Policy and the Bank’s plans to engage non- 
governmental stakeholders in the monitoring project implementation and results. 

The private sector representatives suggested that the Bank and other donors’ efforts to address the 
business environment may be spread too thinly and unanimously argued for renewed attention to 
functioning of the tax and customs administration. They also reiterated the importance of accurate and 
timely national economic statistics to help private investors and entrepreneurs plan carefully in a 
challenging environment, and the critical binding constraint related to security of property rights and the 
functioning of land administration 

Donors welcomed the Bank’s continued efforts to partner with other financiers, and invited the Bank to 
join in the EU-European bilateral donors division of labor initiative. They also argued for an increasing 
Bank Group role in addressing the informal economy and helping raise private sector capacities.

ANNEX 6: GENDER ASSESSMENT 

Figure 1 below presents selected indicators o f gender achievement and gender inequality, benchmarking 
Albania (in yellow) against the Western Balkans (in green) and the ECA region (in red)." A s all figures 
are standardized to the ECA average it is easy to see the areas where Albania and the Western Balkans 
perform very differently from the rest of the region. 

For education, there are limited gender differences in secondary enrolment, and an interesting pattern 
emerges for tertiary. While tertiary enrolments for women are much lower than the ECA average, the 
ratio o f male to female enrolment is very high. Even if a similar pattern holds in the Western Balkans, in 
Albania it appears more pronounced. Maternal mortality stands out a s a b ig outlier in Albania a s opposed 
t o other countries in the region even though the share of births attended by health personnel (not shown) 
is a t the ECA average. Another interesting dimension in which Albania appears t o stand out against the 
rest o f the region is fertility. Adolescent fertility rates are lower than ECA and the rest o f the Western 
Balkans (though overall fertility is much higher than in the region). While the female share in the total 
labour force is comparable to the regional one, female employment is more concentrated in agriculture 
than in other countries.

Focusing on national data provides an opportunity to look more closely a t the socio-economic 
characteristics o f women and how they differ f iom those o f men. Data on the labour market confirm a 
very gendered division of labour, with women much less likely than men t o be engaged in market 
activities - women 's activity rate is at 50 percent compared to 71 percent for men. A s a result, only 43 
percent of the economically active population is female. The limited coverage o f preschool services (only 

' * The indicators presented are limited by data availability. For the sake of comparability the indicators refer to the 
latest year for which the indicators are available for the majority of the countries being compared. The data 
referred to in this figure, therefore, might not be the most updated for Albania.

40 percent of children attend kindergarten) and of other gender friendly services helps explain the low 
levels of labour market participation. 

Women not only are less likely to be engaged in market activities, they also are less likely to be in the 
sectors which before the crisis experienced marked employment growth, such as construction. Trend data 
show that during the decade to 2006 female stagnated, while male employment increased. Firm level 
surveys confirm this picture, with only 37 percent of women as full time workers, and with only 9 percent 
of fu l l time non-production workers being women. While this is in line with the regional performance, 
only 11 percent of firms in 2007 had women participating in their ownership, against an ECA average 
more than 3 times as high. 

While younger women are gradually closing the gap v i s - h i s men in terms of human capital, access to 
other type of capital remain tilted toward better access by men. For example, the law guarantees equality 
of property rights, but men typically remain the official owners, while many women have difficulty 
exercising their rights to access to propertym other than land. Similarly, limited de facto access to loans 
is seen as one of key constraints limiting female entrepreneurship. 

The persistence of some of the starkest aspects of gender inequality emerges from recent data on domestic 
violence. According to a recent survey run by the Statistical Office (UNICEF-INSTAT 2009) 3 1 percent 
of women experienced physical violence, and 13 percent sexual violence in their marriage or relationship, 
with psychological and emotional abuse even more widespread. Less than 30 percent of the victims 
sought help, and more than 90 percent of those who did relied on their family rather than formal 
institutions, which appear to be inadequate. Another form of violence, trafficking which in Albania is 
linked to the exploitation of prostitution, has been criminalized in 2001, though many of the problems in 
the institutional response (such as the criminalization of the victims) remain pervasive. 

Finally, while traditional gender roles remain strong, steps are being taken to address asymmetries in the 
system. With regards to participation in decision making, for example, the 2009 Electoral Code 
introduced a 30 percent gender quota. The representation of women in parliament in 2009 doubled from 
previous elections reaching 23 female deputies (16 percent of the total, compared to 7 percent in the 
previous parliament and 15 percent of the ECA average). However, that the Central Election 
Commission did not apply the sanctions provided for in the Electoral Code to the lists that did not meet 
the quota.

? Notes: The index combines the number of additional hot, dry and wet years; hot, dry and wet summers; and hot, 
dry and wet winters projected over the 2070-2100 period relative to the 1961-1990 period. As such, countries 
already experiencing substantial variability and extremes are less likely to rank highly on this index (e.g., India 
and the Czech Republic have about the same score). 
2o Our vulnerability index combines three sub-indices capturing a country?s exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive 
capacity. The first, exposure, is based on an index measuring the strength of future climate change relative to 
today?s natural variability (Baettig et ai. 2007). The index is available on a country basis and includes both 
annual and seasonal temperature and precipitation indicators. It combines the number of additional hot, dry and 
wet years; hot, d r y and wet summers; and hot, dry and wet winters projected over the 2070-2100 period relative 
to the 1961-1990 period. This suggests that the countries most exposed to future climatic change are Russia, 
Albania, Turkey, Armenia and, to a lesser extent, Macedonia and Tajikistan.

ANNEX 9: COUNTRY FINANCING PARAMETERS 

T h e country financing parameters for A lb an i a set o u t b e low were app roved b y t h e R eg ion a l Vice 

P re s iden t , Eu rop e and Cen t ra l Asia in M a r c h 2005. 

Item 
Cost Sharing: Limit on the 
proportion of individual project 
costs that the Bank may finance. 

Parameter 
Up to 100 percent 

Recurrent Cost Financing: Any 
limits that would apply to the 
overall amount of recurrent 
expenditures that the Bank may 
fmance. 

No country-level limit 
on recurrent cost 
financing. 

Local Cost Financing: Are the 
requirements for Bank fmancing of 
local expenditures met, namely that: 
(i) financing requirements for the 
countries 
development program 
would exceed the public sector’s 
own resources and expected 
domestic borrowing; and (ii) the 
financing of foreign expenditures 
alone would not enable the Bank to 
assist in the fmancing of individual 
projects. 
Taxes and duties: Are there any 
taxes and duties that the Bank 
would not finance? 

Yes 

Yes 

101 

Remarks 
Individual projects may be financed 
up to 100 percent. The level of B a rk 
financing will be considered on a 
case by case basis. In the aggregate, 
it is expected that current financing 
patterns would broadly continue - 
with significant financing by the 
Government and other donors, and 
Bank fmancing continuing at the 
current level of about 5 5 percent of 
pro jec t costs. 
In determining Bank financing of 
recurrent costs in individual projects, 
the B a rk would take into account 
sustainability issues at the sector and 
project levels. Accordingly, where 
individual 
projects 
include 
significant recurrent costs, a detailed 
assessment will be 
conducted 
addressing 
the 
sustainability of 
project achievements, the implied 
h t u r e budgetary outlays, and the 
sustainability of proposed Bank- 
financed recurrent costs. 
The two criteria are met. The Bank 
may fmance local costs as needed in 
individual projects. 

The Bank may finance all taxes and 
duties in Albania. At the project- 
level 
the Bank would consider 
whether taxes and duties constitute 
an excessively high share of project 
costs. Should taxes or duti4es that 
the Bank considers unreasonable be 
introduced, the CFP will be updated. 

The Country Financing Parameters provide for allowing Bank financing of up to 100 percent o f project 
costs, with the level of Bank financing considered as needed in individual projects. The flexibility to 
finance up to 100 percent of project activities is appropriate as the Government of Albania has shown 
commitment and ownership of its development program. The Government has established an IPS, linked 
to a medium-term budget framework. The Bank’s lending program represents only a modest share of the 
country7s public investment financing. The actual proportion of Bank financing for individual projects 
would be calibrated as needed, however, to ensure adherence to the overall CPS lending envelope and 
ensure the sustainability of project-funded activities (especially with respect to recurrent costs). Given the 
strong likelihood that Albania may be entering a period of significant fiscal pressures during the present 
CPS, consideration would be given to raising financing percentages to 100 percent for some ongoing and 
new investment operations in order to prevent a delay in implementation (and hence impact) of the 
projects. 

Moreover, as Albania has graduated from IDA (mid-2008), there has been a decline in the availability of 
grant or concessional external development funds from a number of donors and multi- and bi-lateral 
agencies besides the Bank. This trend is expected to continue in the coming years implying that the Bank 
may need to continue to provide substantial financing for local a s well as foreign costs as it has already 
done in the past. Thus far, the Bank has been financing a significant share of local costs of investment 
lending to support Government development program, from 90 percent in social sector to 10 percent for 
infrastructure sector. This trend is expected to continue during FY 11-14 CPS period, considered on case 
by case basis. 

On financing of taxes and duties, the tax regime in Albania is considered moderate and well within the 
levels seen in neighboring countries. VAT contributes to over half of the tax revenue, and is levied at 20 
percent for companies with more than Lek 8.0 million in annual income, 10 percent for non-profit 
organizations and 3-5 percent for small businesses. The income tax rate for individuals and f m s is a flat 
10 percent. To a lesser extent, domestic revenue is collected through import duties and excise taxes. As 
taxes and duties do not constitute a high share of project costs, the Bank may finance all taxes and duties 
associated with its projects.
