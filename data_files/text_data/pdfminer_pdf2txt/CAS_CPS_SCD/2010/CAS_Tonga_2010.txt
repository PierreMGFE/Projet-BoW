WORLD BANK GROUP 
COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY  
FY11 – FY14 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

i. 
Development outcomes in the remote island archipelago of Tonga are relatively strong compared 
with other Pacific island member countries – but progress has been volatile.  Absolute poverty is rare, 
health and education indicators are relatively strong, and Tonga has made good progress against most MDG 
indicators.  Like many other small and remote island economies, however, Tonga’s development prospects 
are shaped by it economic geography.  The economy is highly vulnerable to external shocks.  Because of its 
narrow economic base and heavy reliance on remittances from citizens living overseas, Tonga has been hard 
hit by the slowdown in the US and other OECD countries, as well as by the food and fuel price shocks of 
2008.   

ii. 
Renewing economic reform momentum will be vital for Tonga to bounce back more strongly from 
current economic difficulties.  Policy reform is a necessary although not always sufficient condition for 
progress in many small and remote island states.  While the Pacific island states are at the margins of the 
global economy and highly reliant on relationships with metropolitan countries, experience also shows that 
those countries that have done best have been those able attract new private investment to promote growth.  
Tonga made a strong start on economic reforms, particularly associated with WTO entry in 2007.  More 
recent political reform has also marked Tonga’s continuing transition to a Constitutional Monarchy.  Still, 
significant challenges remain to further strengthen public expenditure policy and management, particularly in 
light of emerging fiscal pressures, and to reinvigorate structural economic reforms. 

iii.  
The World Bank Group is committed to increasing its support for Tonga, in close collaboration 
with other development partners.  World Bank Group engagement will be structured around the themes of 
supporting economic reform; generating opportunities through greater global and regional integration; and 
building resilience against shocks.  There is potentially room for the Bank to provide $50 million in grant 
funds to Tonga over the next 4 years, significantly more than the $33 million has been provided in the period 
since Tonga joined the Bank in 1985 until now.  There is also scope for the Bank to provide flexible budget 
support to meet needs emerging from recent economic shocks, although this will depend on the development 
of a credible reform program by a new Government after elections in November 2010.  The Bank anticipates 
working in close cooperation with other partners to undertake analytical work to help provide a new 
Government with the detailed information on which they can make policy choices.   

iv. 
Coordinated IDA and IFC engagement will also focus on encouraging opportunities for the 
private sector and on strengthening service delivery through the transparent and competitive contracting 
of functions to the private sector.  New World Bank Group engagement with Tonga will build on the 
successes that have been achieved to date, such as the coordinated Bank Group support for the telecoms 
revolution that has swept the Pacific in the past few years, increasing the number of Tongans with access to 
mobile phone services from 6% to 60% of the population.  Just as IDA and IFC were able to play 
complementary roles in encouraging the opening of the telecoms market, strengthening regulation, and 
supporting new private investment, there is considerable scope to exploit synergies across both institutions to 
make greater room for the private sector to generate opportunities. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
I. 

RATIONALE FOR A COUNTRY STRATEGY FOR THE KINGDOM OF TONGA 

1. 
The World Bank Group is significantly scaling up analytical and financial support to help the 
Kingdom of Tonga and other small and remote Pacific island countries reduce the constraints of 
economic geography and make the most of opportunities.  Reflecting this scale up, this is the first country 
strategy prepared for Tonga, as well as the first for any of the smaller Pacific island countries.  The Bank’s 
strategy for the Pacific island countries (PICs) was previously set out in a single Regional Engagement 
Framework (REF) covering the period 2006 to 2009.  As Bank Group engagement intensifies, however, 
Pacific island clients are increasingly demanding individual “custom-tailored” strategies to reflect their 
individual circumstances, and to incorporate the support that can be provided from across the Bank Group, 
including both IDA and IFC.  Of course, given the importance of greater regional integration if Pacific island 
countries are to increase opportunities, such bespoke strategies will draw from key elements of a common 
regional approach. An overview of current World Bank Group engagement across the Pacific island 
countries is provided in Attachment 1.  This is not intended as a formal strategy document to replace the 
previous REF, but as a snapshot to provide a wider context for the individual country strategies that will be 
developed over the next few years. 

2. 
Individual country strategies will allow for a greater acknowledgement of the different histories, 
development situation, and challenges of the Pacific island countries, as well as a more nuanced 
discussion of how common regional themes in the Bank Group’s engagement with the region are 
translated into specific country contexts.  While moving to a “custom-tailored” approach for individual 
island countries, there will be constraints.  While the Bank Group is significantly scaling up the staff 
resources devoted to growing programs, strategies for each of the Pacific islands will inevitably need to be 
relatively streamlined and focused, and will not necessarily be able to have the same level of details as for 
some of the Bank Group’s larger clients.  Country-specific engagement will be framed in CASs or ISNs 
when possible and when data and substance are available (as with Tonga). Engagement in some countries 
will, however, be approached through a lighter, more indicative snapshot intended to give a broad and 
flexible framework for action. 

3. 
A country strategy for Tonga is being presented now in order to provide a broader context in 
which to seek Board approval for the first development policy operation for Tonga, as well as investments 
in the transport sector and post-tsunami rehabilitation.  The Government of Tonga requested the Bank in 
September 2009 to extend a DPO to assist the Government respond to the cumulative external shocks of the 
2008 food and fuel price spikes, as well as the global economic slowdown.  These shocks have resulted in the 
3economy contracting in both FY09 and FY10, and to a significant decline in domestic revenue.  While the 
Government has reduced expenditures in real terms, a significant fiscal deficit is emerging and the 
Government is now starting to face cash flow constraints.  As is outlined in more detail through this 
document, Bank management considers that the reform program undertaken by the Government justifies a 
DPO.  Other donors such as the ADB and EC have already provided or agreed to provide budget support, and 
further delays could potentially affect service delivery in Tonga.   

4. 
Proceeding now with a DPO is important to provide the incoming Government that will be formed 
after elections in November 2010 with the breathing room to carefully consider expenditure priorities in 
the lead up to the FY12 budget.  Management is presenting this strategy in combination with the proposed 
DPO in order to clearly set out the Bank’s commitment to offer further budget support for any new 
Government following elections, subject to agreement on a reform program on which to base such support.  
Discussions with a new Government will obviously be required to reach agreement on the details any reform 
program that might underpin further budget support, although this policy dialogue is likely to include fiscal 
management, strengthened public financial management, and further encouragement to  private sector led 
growth.  It is anticipated that a joint public expenditure review being undertaken during 2010 and 2011 will 
provide a basis for partners to engage a new Government in a coordinated manner.   

1 

 
 
 
 
 
5. 
As well as being discussed with Government, the Bank has consulted Parliamentarians and other 
stakeholders from across the political spectrum in Tonga, who have emphasized the importance they place 
on the Bank signaling upfront – through this CAS – its commitment to engage constructively with any 
new Government.  The strategy will clearly need to be implemented flexibly and take into account the 
priorities of a new Government.  The Bank is, however, consciously moving ahead of the elections with a 
framework for engagement that could be construed as a white paper for a new Government’s consideration.  
Wide consultations that underpinned the CAS suggest there is agreement from a broad range of stakeholders 
on the priority of investments outlined, including in the transport, energy and telecommunications sectors.  In 
addition, the CAS provides a foundation to engage a new Government and to begin an early discussion to 
influence its economic and social development program.  While there are inherent risks in presenting a 
strategy prior to elections, there are potentially greater risks to the Tongan economy and the Bank’s 
credibility in delaying a DPO until after elections, or in providing budget support now without also setting 
out the Bank’s commitment to engage constructively with any new Government and a potential framework 
for such engagement. 

II. 

COUNTRY CONTEXT AND DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES 

Economic Geography 

6. 
Tonga is a Polynesian country with a history of human settlement extending back 2-3000 years 
when the first Austronesian speaking voyagers reached the islands.  As with other Polynesian cultures, 
Tongan society is highly structured.  The current monarch, King George Tupou V, is the descendant of a 
royal line that has remained unbroken since 1845.  Tonga is one of the few Pacific island countries never to 
have been formally colonized, although it was a British protectorate between 1900 and 1970.  Tongan 
monarchs have in the past ruled territory encompassing parts of present day Fiji, Niue, Samoa, and Tokelau. 

7. 
Absolute poverty is rare, and development outcomes are relatively strong.  Average annual per 
capita incomes are approximately $3,200, higher than most of the Bank’s member countries in the Pacific 
(although still well below some of those islands that are more integrated with metropolitan countries such as 
the French Territories, American Samoa, or the Cook islands).  Strong family and church networks, as well 
as extensive subsistence agricultural production, means that food poverty is virtually non-existent.  Unlike 
many of the Pacific island countries, Tonga remains broadly on track to meet most of the MDGs, and has 
among the best social indicators of any of the Bank’s Pacific island member countries.  There is almost 
universal literacy, with 98% of children ages 6–14 enrolled in school, and little or no difference between 
enrollment rates for boys and girls.  As well as the Government, which provides free primary education, 
churches play a central role in Tonga’s education system particularly at the secondary level.  Health 
indicators have improved steadily, and access to safe water and sanitation is widespread. Life expectancy is 
73 years for women and 70 years for men. About 98% of Tongan women give birth in the presence of skilled 
birth attendants. Under-5 mortality is 23 per 1,000 live births (the best of any of the Bank’s Pacific island 
member countries), and continues to decline steadily.  Maternal mortality is low, with an average of 2 
reported deaths per year associated with birth related complications, although this has proven stubbornly 
resistant to further gains.  Despite good health and education outcomes for women and girls, however, 
women’s representation in Parliament is low.  The key challenge for Tonga is to maintain achievements, with 
anecdotal reports of declining educational outcomes despite strong enrolments, and a rapid increase in 
lifestyle diseases such as obesity and diabetes. 

8. 
Tonga, as with many of the other small Pacific island countries, is shaped very much by its 
economic geography.  The country has a population of approximately 100,000, over half of which are 
concentrated in the main island of Tongatapu, but with small populations scattered across 36 inhabited 
islands among an archipelago of 171 islands.  Tonga’s total landmass is about 750 square kilometers, spread 

2 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
over 800 km from north to south.  The capital, Nuku’alofa, is over 2,000 km from its nearest large market, 
New Zealand, and over 3,000 km from Australia. 

9. 
Development gains are fragile; although at the margins of the global economy, Tonga is highly 
volatile and subject to external shocks.  Tourism is a growing source of foreign exchange, and has been a 
key destination for limited foreign private investment, although this sector still makes up only 10% of the 
economy.  Agriculture also provides a source of livelihood for a large proportion of the population, although 
export potential is largely limited to niche products such as squash on some fisheries products (Tonga does 
not have the same size pelagic tuna resource as some of the more northerly Pacific island countries).  
Tonga’s medium-term growth prospects are constrained by its geographic isolation, its narrow export base, 
and impediments to private sector activity.  Systemic volatility is due to the narrowness of the economy and 
the limited scope for diversification.  Comparative advantages are limited due to permanent cost wedges 
associated with Tonga’s small size and remoteness from markets, making it difficult for the country to 
compete in all but a few niche markets.  Volatility is exacerbated by Tonga’s exposure to natural disasters. 

10. 
Tonga is heavily reliant, and likely to remain so, on relationships with regional and metropolitan 
countries, through investment, trade, remittances and aid.  As well as domestic policy performance, 
development outcomes will reflect global economic developments. 

 Tonga is a small open economy.  It is heavily reliant on imports, which are equivalent to about 40% of 
GNI, and faces a large structural trade deficit.  The country is also heavily reliant on external investment 
in industries such as tourism.   

 Development cooperation is an enduring feature of the economy, with official development flows 
equivalent to about 15% of GNI.  ODA has been central to Tongan Government service delivery efforts, 
and is likely to remain so. 

 Remittances are a key feature of the economy.  As many Tongan nationals live and work abroad 
(primarily New Zealand and the United States, as well as Australia), as live in Tonga.  In total, 
remittances have historically been equivalent to between about 40% of GNI.  As shown below, Tonga is 
the leading recipient of remittances relative to GDP among all the Pacific island countries.  Remittances 
are the largest source of foreign exchange, and a primarily used to fund consumption.

11. 
In this environment, good domestic policies and leadership are necessary but not always sufficient 
for progress; external factors are crucial to development outcomes.  Although there is always room for 
further improvement, the domestic policy environment has strengthened steadily, and Tonga’s CPIA of 3.5 
reflects not just a steady increase over the past few years but puts Tonga in the top half of all IDA recipients.  
Good macro and structural policies are necessary to ensure that economies are resilient and attract 
investment, and will also be important if Tonga is to attract concessional budget support from donors that 
will be required to respond to the global slowdown.  Nevertheless, good domestic policies alone may not be 
enough by themselves in the small island states.  Even where policy environments are strong, continued 
remittances and generous, well-targeted, foreign assistance flows are likely to be needed to support current 
levels of service delivery and lifestyles.  More broadly, greater economic integration, more open labor 
markets by regional metropolitan countries, and regional shared service delivery, will be vital for Tonga’s 
longer-term future, as with many other Pacific island countries.   

Constitutional Reform 

12. 
Tonga is embarking on significant constitutional reforms that will increase democratic 
representation and embed a constitutional monarchy.  The King appointed the first commoner to hold the 
position of Prime Minister in 2006.  Parliament, with the support of King George Tupou V, has also now 
agreed to electoral reforms that will result in 17 of 26 members being directly elected through universal 
suffrage, with 9 continuing to be elected from the 33 hereditary nobles.  This compares with a Parliament 
that now includes 9 elected members, 9 nobles, and up to 12 members of the King’s appointed Privy Council.  
Following elections scheduled for November 25, 2010, it is anticipated that the Prime Minister will be 
elected by Parliament, and will appoint his own Cabinet, largely drawn from Parliament.  Nevertheless, this 
transition is likely to require careful management to ensure that Tonga continues to be able to draw on the 
executive experience available. 

Recent Economic Developments 

13. 
Tonga, like many of its Pacific neighbors, has been hard hit by the global economic crisis, 
particularly coming as it did on top of food and fuel price spikes which especially hurt remote island 
economies.  While Tonga experienced reasonably strong growth during the latter part of the 1990s and early 
into the 2000s, recent economic performance has been volatile (as set out in the chart below).  Declines in 
remittances, tourism and exports associated with the global crisis have led to a slowdown in the economy.  
This compounded difficulties caused by fuel price spikes in 2008, as soaring transport costs further limited 
export competitiveness, and increased import costs – particularly for imported diesel for electricity 
generation (fuel imports account for about 25% of all imports and about 10% of GNI).  Economic activity 
contracted by about 0.5% in FY09, and by a similar amount in FY10.  These shocks came just as the 
economy was starting to rebound following domestic disturbances in 2006 that led to riots in Nuku’alofa.

14. 
Volatility has been exacerbated because of Tonga’s exposure to natural disasters.  In September 
2009, a tsunami devastated the communities on the remote northernmost Niuatoputapu islands.  As recently 
as December 2001 Cyclone Waka ripped through the Vava’u and Ha’apai island groups, causing significant 
crop losses and damaging or destroying approximately 850 houses, with total losses estimated at $50 million 
(equivalent to 15% of annual GNI).  Tonga was subsequently hit again in 2010 by Cyclone Rene. 

15. 
As with many countries, the Tongan authorities responded to the economic slowdown by 
loosening fiscal and monetary policy, and this will hopefully provide a foundation for recovery.  Fiscal 
pressures were also increased as a result of civil service salary rises during 2007 to 2009, although these were 
partially offset by an associated rationalization of the public service and a redundancy program that saw the 
civil service decline from 5,000 to 4,000 people.  The accommodative policy responses, with additional 
support from donors, appear to have provided some relief from external shocks.  A modest rebound in 
growth performance is anticipated in FY11, based on increased construction, tourism, and remittances – 
although this is subject to considerable uncertainty and downside risks associated with the strength of the 
global recovery and commodity prices.

The room for continued expansionary policies is, however, constrained.  The impact of 
expansionary policies in small open economies is likely to be limited.  In addition, the authorities will also 
need to make a sustained effort to reduce the fiscal deficit, which has reached 4% of GNI, and which will 
require external financing from bilateral and multilateral donors.  Tonga’s fiscal balance has not deteriorated 
to the extent of other small islands, such as the Maldives, but is now among the highest in the Pacific after 
Kiribati.  As well as increasing fiscal deficits, Government decisions to borrow significant funds from China 
– although on terms that are broadly concessional - will result in a rapid increase in external debt, which is 
projected to rise to over 50% of GDP in nominal terms (and over 30% of GDP in NPV terms) 1.  As a result, 

1   Tonga’s external public debt has increased from under 30% of GNI in 2006 to over 45% of GNI in 2010 largely as a 
result of two loans from China’s EXIM Bank that became effective between 2007 and 2010 to finance reconstruction 
of the central business district following the 2006 riots and road investments.  These loans bear a 2% interest rate, a 5 
year grace period, and 20 year maturity.  Even in the current low interest rate environment, these loans carry a 
concessional element of about 34%, and are focused on specific and priority infrastructure investments. As such, they 
are not necessarily incompatible with the Bank’s policy on non-concessional borrowing.  Elsewhere in the Pacific,

Tonga is in the “high risk” range of debt distress.  This level of debt could leave the economy vulnerable and 
will limit fiscal space to respond to future shocks or to scale up support for emerging development priorities.  
In this context, the Government’s FY11 budget adopted realistic revenue forecasts, and attempts to limit 
recurrent spending while protecting key service delivery functions in health and education.  Other spending 
increases are limited to an increase in donor funded activities.  Nevertheless, fiscal management and 
medium-term budgeting process will need further strengthening, as will efforts to improve revenue collection 
and rationalize expenditure while maintaining services.  The 2011-12 budget is likely to require difficult 
decisions to reduce spending in lower priority areas, and efforts to strengthen revenue collection, especially 
at the border.  While external financial support from the donor community is likely to reduce the impact of 
the crisis, the level of such financing is likely to be linked to reform progress.

17. 
Structural reforms undertaken by the Government promise to improve prospects for private sector 
growth, although reform momentum will need to be maintained.  The current Government has sought to 
stimulate private sector-led growth, and Tonga is now rated as number 52 in the World Bank’s Doing 
Business survey, the highest among all the Bank’s Pacific island countries.  After a period of largely inward 
looking economic policies, Tonga has since 2002 gradually adopted a more outward looking approach.  
Efforts initially focused on trade reform, with Tonga becoming a member of the WTO in 2007, and ratifying 
all regional trade agreements.  A consumption tax was introduced in 2005 to replace most import duties.  
Trade reform has been complemented by new foreign investment legislation, which came into effect in April 
2007.  An amendment to the Companies Act in December 2009 streamlined the process for registering a 
company and introduced an electronic registry system using New Zealand registry software.  This system 
will reduce both the time and cost involved with registering a business.  New business licensing legislation 
was introduced in 2009, although did not remove ministerial discretion on the granting of business licenses 
as recommended by IFC.    

18. 
Despite gains, however, renewing momentum for structural reforms will be important.  Relatively 
stronger growth over the past decade in neighboring Samoa illustrates the potential benefits of continuing 
with reform over a longer time period than has yet been the case in Tonga.  Priorities are likely to include 
further reform of public enterprises, which control about 20% of fixed assets, and encouraging investment by 
improving transparency and predictability of the business environment, including more narrowly defining or 
repealing the list of industries reserved for domestic investment.  Land tenure systems are intimately tied up 

China has in the past also modified some loans to become grants.  Nevertheless, further borrowing by the 
Government, even on concessional terms, should be avoided.

with the structure of society and reform will require sensitivity, but options to increase the length of leases 
could encourage further investment.  A Royal Land Commission report, for instance, found that the 
administration of the land system required greater transparency and efficiency, and experience in Samoa – 
where the transition from a deed to a title system in 2009 and a new IT system for property registration has 
reduced processing times by 4 months – highlights options for reducing transaction costs.  Finally, 
strengthening governance and further improving transparency will remain priorities.  Maintaining the 
integrity of the judiciary will be especially important in this regard. 

Government of Tonga’s Development Strategy 

19. 
The Tongan Government’s broad development strategy is set out in the National Strategic 
Planning Framework 2009 – 13 of February 2009.  The NSPF is a focused document that focuses on the 
key determinants of economic and social progress, and concentrates on a limited number of uniquely national 
and whole of government priorities that will need, by their nature, to be addressed in a flexible way over 
longer-term period.  The Government’s vision is “to create a society in which all Tongan’s enjoy higher 
living standards and a better quality of life through good governance, equitable and sustainable private 
sector-led economic growth, improved education and health standards, and cultural development”.  To fulfill 
this vision, the strategy sets out seven primary outcome objectives, underpinned by four enabling themes: 

 

 

 

Facilitating community development by involving district and village communities in meeting their 
service needs;  

Support private sector led growth through better engagement with government, appropriate incentives 
and streamlining of rules and regulations;  

Facilitate the continuation of Constitutional reform; 

 Maintain and develop infrastructure to improve the everyday lives of the people; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Increase the performance of technical and vocational education to meet the challenges of maintaining 
and developing services and infrastructure; 

Improve the health of the people by minimizing the impact of non-communicable diseases; 

Integrate environmental sustainability and climate change into all planning and execution of programs; 

Continue the progress to smaller and more efficient government  to transfer resources to improved 
services and maintenance of assets; 

Ensure state owned enterprises are accountable to government as the owner and provide dividends for 
the benefit of the people in proportion to capital invested;  

Improve the effectiveness of revenue collection to ensure a level playing field and to ensure that 
services to the people can be appropriately funded; and 

Ensure a more coordinated whole of government approach to donor funding. 

Donor Engagement 

20. 
Tonga, like many small island states, is heavily reliant on international development cooperation 
flows which on a per capita basis are some of the highest in the world.  Net flows to Tonga average almost 
$50 million per annum, equivalent to about 15% of GNI or $500 per capita per annum.

Australia is the largest donor in Tonga, as in most of the rest of the Pacific, providing assistance worth 
slightly more than A$25 million (USD 22 million) per annum.  The framework for Australian 
cooperation with Tonga is set out in the Partnership for Development signed by respective Prime 
Ministers in August 2009.  The partnership commits Australia and Tonga to focus on four priority 
outcomes, including (i) improving infrastructure to provide people with reliable and efficient links to 
markets and services, (ii) reducing the prevalence of non-communicable diseases and improving 
primary health care, (iii) building a more highly skilled workforce linked to industry demand, and (iv) 
developing a more efficient public sector. 

The Asian Development Bank has had a long-term engagement in Tonga, based around an integrated 
program of analytical work and investments.  The ADB’s base allocation to Tonga is $14 million over 
4 years, although with room to increase.  Given Tonga’s debt position, current ADB support is 
provided as grants.  ADB has traditionally played a leadership role in economic analysis and advisory 
support, including on SOE reform, and is scaling up given pressures on Tonga from the current global 
slowdown.  ADB approved a two tranche budget support grant in December 2009, with the first 
tranche released in early 2010.  ADB has supported urban development, and will also be taking a more 
central role on climate change adaptation issues in Tonga, and will be the lead donor for Pilot Program 
for Climate Resilience (PPCR) support.  The ADB is also exploring options for greater support in the 
energy and social protection areas. 

China’s support for Tonga has increased significantly in recent years, with significant concessional 
lending for the reconstruction of the central business district, as noted above.  After negotiations with 
the Tongan Government, China has relaxed usual rules and increased the scope for local contracting 
allowed under these investments. 
The European Commission has €5.9 million ($USD 7.5 million) available for Tonga under the 10th 
EDF National indicative program: 2008-2013.  This is intended to focus on energy sector reform.  The 
EC is also in the process of approving a grant of approximately $1 million for the reconstruction of the 
Niuas hospital damaged by the tsunami.  The EC has scope to significantly scale up budget support to 
Tonga in response to the global crisis through its V-FLEX facility, and is considering a €6.5 million 
grant linked to the ADB’s current program of economic support.  Previous EC assistance has supported 
household level solar supply, and on community development in Vava’u.   

Japan has provided assistance worth an average of $6 million per year to Tonga over the past decade.  
The Government of Japan recently provided Tonga with a new ferry to replace the Princess Ashika, 
which sank with tragic results in 2009, and was extensively engaged in the reconstruction of Vaiola 
hospital in Nuku’alofa.  Tonga is also eligible for support from the 6.8 billion yen (USD 66 million) 
Pacific Environment Community Fund (PEC Fund) provided to the Forum Island Countries that the 
Government of Japan announced in 2009 at PALM 5, and which will focus on solar power generation 
and sea water desalination projects in the region. 

New Zealand has a significant presence in Tonga, reflecting links between historically Polynesian 
countries.  The partnership with Tonga is New Zealand’s fifth largest bilateral program, with flows of 
approximately NZ$18 million (USD 13 million) per annum.  As outlined in a September 2008 strategy, 
New Zealand assistance is focused on: (i) Lifting economic performance (particularly in the areas of 
energy, transport and tourism); (ii) strengthening governance, (including political reform, police and 
justice), and (iii) improving education outcomes.  NZ has recently committed NZ$1.5 million (about 

USD 1 million) in budget support, linked to the completion of analytical work on public 
expenditure issues. 

The United Nations system is active in Tonga, with UNDP and UNICEF providing support in response 
to the tsunami in Niuas, and UNICEF and WHO providing technical assistance to the Parliament, and 
to strengthen education and health service delivery respectively.

21. 
Almost all donors recognize the importance of greater coordination to strengthen development 
outcomes in Tonga and throughout the Pacific, as highlighted by Pacific Island Leaders in the Cairns 
Compact agreed in August 2009.  Greater coordination will be especially important to ensure a coordinated 
policy dialogue as donors increasingly move to scale up budget support to assist Tonga respond to external 
shocks and an economic slowdown.  The importance of coordination is reinforced as ODA flows through 
much of the Pacific, including Tonga, are set to increase further as major bilateral and multilateral actors 
increase their engagement in the region, and with very significant new and additional financing anticipated 
for climate change adaptation.  

III. WORLD BANK GROUP ENGAGEMENT WITH TONGA 

Current and Recent Engagement 

22. 
The central element of the World Bank Group’s engagement in Tonga – as across most of the 
Pacific islands over the past few years – has been to connect people more fully with the world.  This has 
been achieved by encouraging policy change that has enabled people to take advantage of new opportunities 
from greater economic integration between Tonga and the global economy.  Particular successes have been 
achieved in encouraging temporary labor migration schemes, and in the telecoms revolution that has 
occurred in the Pacific in the past 4 years. 

23. 
By supporting efforts by New Zealand and Australia to open their labor markets to temporary 
unskilled workers from the Pacific islands, the Bank has helped to provide significant new opportunities 
for Tongans.  Labor is one of the few viable exports for the small and remote Pacific island countries, as 
illustrated by the extensive remittances already received by Tonga.  The Bank played a strong role in the 
advancing labor mobility in the Pacific through the 2006 report ‘Home and Away’ (titled after a popular 
Australian television series), advice to Australia and NZ on international best practice, and technical 
assistance to strengthen the capacity of island countries to manage labor selection.  The NZ Recognized 
Seasonal Employer Scheme (RSE) has been operating for about 3 years.  During that time, almost 9,000 
Pacific islanders have been placed in horticultural industry jobs (primarily fruit and vegetables picking) for 
periods of between 2 and 6 months.  The cap for the number of people able to be employed under the scheme 
has increased twice, and is now 8,000 people per year.  Approximately 20% of these placements have been 
provided to Tongans, in part reflecting the strong ties between Tonga and NZ.  Studies suggest that workers 
in NZ have, on average, earned approximately $4,400 after deductions and living expense).  This could 
generate a potential injection to the Pacific island economies of over $40m per year, including perhaps $6m 
per year for Tonga.  Australia is also introducing a similar scheme and, while this has got off to a slow start, 
there is considerable potential for this to provide opportunities for thousands more Pacific islanders.  As well 
as the immediate financial returns, broader benefits have also flowed back into Pacific countries including 
new found skills in agriculture, as well as computer literacy and English language skills.  In a win-win 
situation, New Zealand industry estimates that the scheme has produced benefits to NZ equivalent $150–200 
million in terms of increased agricultural output, with the certainty of labor availability allowing firms to win 
new export contracts.  Building on these schemes, the Bank Group has been engaged with NZ regulators to 
reduce the cost charged by financial institutions for remittances. 

24. 
The mobile telephone revolution throughout the Pacific, with Tonga one of the early adopters, has 
also provided enormous opportunities for people.  The Bank Group has played a significant role in the past 
few years in encouraging telecoms reform to encourage competition and allow new private sector operators, 
with Tonga being one of the first Pacific island countries to open its market.   The Bank has been helping to 
secure reforms by providing policy advice to strengthen regulation.    Maximizing synergies across the Bank 
Group, IFC investments have played a key role in encouraging the entry of new private operators.  In Tonga, 
for instance, an IFC investment of $6.8 million encouraged total new investments by Digicel of $29 million – 
the largest single investment in the country.  Across the Pacific, IFC has now invested $170 million to 

9 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
promote new telecoms markets entrants investing a total of over $500 million in Fiji, PNG, Samoa, and 
Vanuatu.  The end result of reforms has been to dramatically lower telecoms costs and improve coverage – 
with mobile phone usage increasing from about 6% of the Tongan population to almost 60% in only a few 
years.  Improved telecommunications has literally opened up the world to those previously disconnected. 
Connectivity allows fishermen to access timely price information; enables mobile banking services; better 
connects people to schools and health services, and provides entrepreneurs with better information. 

25. 
Providing credibility for our broader efforts to encourage policy change, the Bank has approved 6 
investments in Tonga with IDA financing of $28 million since the country became a member in 1985, 
mobilizing a further $5m in trust funds.  Despite being above the usual operational cut-off for IDA, Tonga 
remains eligible for concessional assistance from the Bank under IDA’s small island state exception, 
intended to reflect the particular vulnerability and volatility of such countries.  The Bank has been a 
relatively small source of development finance for Tonga, and most activities have been undertaken in close 
collaboration with other partners, with many seeing the Bank’s advantage as its ability not just to finance 
activities but in the global knowledge it can bring.  In addition to IDA support, co-financing of $5 million has 
been mobilized through trust funds, with Bank activities also coordinated with and influencing parallel 
investments by partners even when resources were not directed through coordinated systems.  Given Tonga’s 
debt position, all new IDA support since 2007 has been provided on grant terms.

26. World Bank Group investments over the past decade have been effective in improving 
development outcomes in Tonga.  While individual counterparts have been very strong, given capacity 
limitations inherent in a small country like Tonga, a key element of recent success has been to ensure that 
projects have been focused, built on areas where Tonga has done well or replicated successes elsewhere in 
the region, and because significant implementation support has been provided.  While we have experienced 
significant portfolio difficulties elsewhere in the Pacific, recent portfolio performance in Tonga has been 
relatively strong.  Lessons from engagement highlight the importance of ensuring that activities are simple 
and focused, and that significant downstream implementation support is provided.

Following Cyclone Waka on December 31, 2001, the Bank moved quickly to begin an emergency 
recovery project within 5 months.  The project was successful in restoring the standard of living for 
affected people, building 470 houses and rehabilitating a further 370.  New houses were “climate 
proofed” and the project strengthened nationwide resilience to natural hazards and new building codes.  
The success of these efforts was evident when Cyclone Rene hit a wider area in 2010 – although wind 
speeds were comparable to Cyclone Waka, infrastructure damage was limited. 

The health sector program supported successful efforts to rehabilitate Tonga’s hospital services.  By 
strengthening core tertiary care, this has provided a foundation to underpin continuing improvements 
in health service delivery.  Tonga’s key health indicators – already among the best in the Pacific – have 
continued to improve during this period.  The Vaiola hospital reconstruction was undertaken in close 
cooperation with parallel Japanese and Australian investments.

 

Education sector support has focused on the introduction of school grant mechanisms to provide 
principles, teachers, and parents with greater input into decisions at the school level, increasing local 
level oversight and accountability in an effort to improve education outcomes given already very high 
primary enrolment rates.  Through the Education for All Fast Track Initiative (EFA FTI) and in 
conjunction with AusAID and NZAID, the Bank has also supported assessments of reading ability in 
the early grades of primary education.  This initiative is expected to help Tonga make a transition from 
a focus on enrolments to a focus on improved learning outcomes.  Education investments have been an 
example of close donor coordination, with NZ financing exceeding that provided by the Bank. 

A transport sector consolidation investment aims to replicate the successful experience in Samoa over 
the past decade of strengthening the management of infrastructure assets2 and to improve civil aviation 
and maritime safety.  This has got off to a slow start, and is being restructured to increase the focus on 
maritime safety after the tragic sinking in 2009 of the Princess Ashika ferry.   Australia will be 
providing $9.3 million through this investment, primarily to support improved road maintenance by 
increasingly contracting such functions to local private sector firms, providing counter-cyclical 
employment opportunities, at a time of economic slowdown. 

27. 
Underpinning growing World Bank Group engagement in Tonga, a joint liaison office was 
established with the ADB in early 2009.  The office, which is staffed by a local professional, has been 
instrumental in improving dialogue with the Government and encouraging better cooperation with the ADB 
and with other partners present in Nuku’alofa.  This has been the first shared rather than simply co-located 
office between the Bank and ADB, and has provided a model for similar joint offices being established 
elsewhere in the Pacific. 

Planned World Bank Group Engagement FY11 – FY14 

28. World Bank Group engagement over the next four years is anticipated to reflect the particular 
circumstances of Tonga, as well as key features of the Bank Group’s broader approach to the Pacific 
islands which face a range of common challenges.  A four year framework has been chosen as this will 
align the strategy with the electoral cycle in Tonga, although there will obviously be scope to tailor the 
program to the priorities of a new Government that is formed in late 2010 after elections.  Such a timeframe 
will also align this strategy with the IDA replenishment cycle.  Key themes running through Bank Group 
engagement with Tonga, as with most of the rest of the Pacific, include: 

 

 

 

Supporting policy reform to strengthen growth prospects and improve service delivery; 

Generating opportunities through greater global and regional integration; and 

Building resilience against shocks. 

29. 
As outlined in the introduction, a strategy is being presented now in order to provide a broader 
context in which to seek Board approval for the first development policy operation for Tonga.  The 
Government of Tonga requested the Bank in September 2009 to extend a DPO to assist the Government 
respond to the cumulative external shocks of the 2008 food and fuel price spikes, as well as the global 
economic slowdown.  These shocks have resulted in the economy contracting in FY09 and FY10, and a 
significant decline in domestic revenue.  While the Government has reduced expenditures in real terms, a 
significant fiscal deficit is emerging and the Government is now starting to face cash flow constraints.  
Responding to these shocks, the Government is continuing with reforms, and other donors such as the ADB 
and EC have already provided or agreed to provide budget support.   

2  The success of the Samoa experience was illustrated in the way the Government was able to mobilize private firms to 
respond to the devastating tsunami in 2009 

11 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                            
30. 
Proceeding now with a DPO is important to provide the new Government that will be formed after 
elections in November 2010 with the breathing room to carefully consider expenditure priorities in the 
lead up to the FY12 budget.  Given reforms to date and the movement by other donors, delaying a proposed 
DPO would damage the Bank’s credibility, affecting the scope to influence policy over the medium term.  
Delays would also adversely affect the Government’s fiscal position and ability to continue programs.  As a 
result of declining revenues, the Government is facing a significant fiscal deficit despite real cuts to 
expenditures, and is also now starting to have to manage cash flow constraints.   

31. 
Presenting a country strategy at the same time as the DPO provides an opportunity to reassure all 
parties in Tonga that the Bank is committed to working with any new Government, and to provide a 
framework for early dialogue to engage a new Government and influence policy priorities.  A new 
Government will face significant fiscal pressures over the next few years, and is likely to need further budget 
support from partners.  By setting out the Bank’s willingness to engage constructively with any new 
Government, the CAS minimizes risks that the Bank could be seen as playing politics by proceeding with the 
current DPO.  At the same time, while setting out the Bank’s commitment to work with any new 
Government, the CAS also provides an opportunity for early dialogue with a wide range of stakeholders to 
influence the discussion about economic and social priorities.  In this sense, the CAS is potentially a ‘white 
paper” upon which to base dialogue.  While agreement will need to be reached with any new Government on 
a detailed reform program to underpin further budget support, this is likely to depend on fiscal adjustment, 
strengthening public financial management, and further encouraging private sector led growth.  A joint 
public expenditure review being undertaken by the ADB, IMF PFTAC and the Bank in conjunction with key 
bilateral partners during the remainder of 2010 and 2011 will provide a basis for coordinated policy dialogue 
with a new Government regarding reform priorities.   

32. 
Although the shape of a new Government will depend very much on the elections in late 
November, there does appear to be a broad consensus for key reform programs in Tonga.  Discussions 
with the Government, Parliamentarians, and business and civil society groups suggest that there is broad 
agreement for efforts to: (i) continue opening the Tongan economy and encouraging outward looking private 
sector led growth; (ii) improve public financial management; (iii) address acknowledged fiscal pressures in a 
way that will maintain key Government services; and (iv) continue reforms outlined in the Tonga energy 
roadmap including the opening of the generation market and increased investment in renewable energy.  
While there are obviously differences in approach and nuance between different groups, the Government 
intends to seek Parliamentary commitment to key reform programs currently underway with World Bank and 
other international support.  Similarly, extensive discussions with a wide range of stakeholders in Tonga 
suggest there is widespread support for key elements of the Bank Groups proposed engagement.   

Supporting Economic Reform 

33. 
A central feature of Bank Group engagement in Tonga – as well as elsewhere in the Pacific 
region – will be to scale up analytical and financial support for policy reform.  World Bank engagement on 
economic reform issues in the Pacific has been limited over the past decade, but is now being scaled-up in 
order to respond to demands from Pacific clients as a result of the global economic slowdown, and reflecting 
the Bank’s global comparative advantages.  This will be done in close cooperation with other partners, many 
of which have been more engaged on these issues in the Pacific in recent times. 

34. 
Joint public expenditure analysis will be especially important to engage and support the potential 
efforts of a new Government to rationalize expenditures while maintaining and improving core service 
delivery functions.  Building blocks for this work are in place with health and education sector expenditure 
analyses supported by the Australian Government.  The Bank intends to contribute substantially to joint 
public expenditure analytical work to be undertaken with the ADB, the IMF Pacific Financial Technical 
Assistance Center (PFTAC), and key bilateral donors.  This is intended to provide a foundation for initial 

12 

 
 
 
 
 
 
engagement with a new Government, as well as to support more detailed analysis of options to streamline 
expenditure while maintaining service delivery at the sectoral level.   

35. 
Joint analytical work will be critical to provide a foundation to underpin a more coordinated 
discussion between the Government and partners on potential budget support. Such operations will aim to 
support both shorter-term economic recovery as well as help strengthen growth prospects and service 
delivery over the medium-term.  Given needs, a range of donors are likely to provide such support, with 
ADB having approved $10m fast disbursing financing in 2009 linked to the prioritization of essential public 
expenditure including protection of health and education spending, continued public financial management 
and SOE reform, and social protection.  The EC is considering providing approximately €5.5 million (USD 7 
million) in budget support through its V-FLEX facility, linked to the 2nd tranche of the ADB operation.  And 
Australia and NZ have both provided or are considering limited sector specific budget support.  A World 
Bank energy sector policy operation of $5m will also provide fast disbursing support, reflecting the progress 
in this sector (discussed further below) as well as progress in strengthening PFM systems.  By helping to 
meet immediate needs, this will ensure the Bank maintains credibility with the authorities and has a “seat at 
the table” for more coordinated future discussions.  Nevertheless, beyond the immediate round of support in 
2010, a greater degree of coordination will be vital if such support is not just to fill short-term gaps but is to 
encourage necessary reform to put the Tongan economy on a more sustainable footing.   

36. 
Should a new Government wish to engage in a substantive discussion on reform, there is scope for 
the Bank to prepare a multi-year development policy operation, starting in FY12, to underpin an agreed 
and coordinated program of reforms and to respond to the aftermath of current economic shocks.  
Elsewhere in the Pacific, the Samoan Government and donors were able to agree of a single coordinated 
matrix underpinning the provision of budget support by all partners.  Similarly, in Solomon Islands, the Core 
Economic Working Group has proved an effective mechanism to strengthen coordination.  These might be 
coordination models that could potentially be replicated in Tonga.  The provision of budget support will, 
however, require a commitment and action by the new Government to continue strengthening public 
financial management systems, make hard fiscal decisions to reduce lower priority budget expenditures and 
strengthen revenue collection, and pursue further structural economic reform. 

37. 
The Bank will continue to support the Tongan Government’s efforts to further strengthen 
governance.  Bank engagement is occurring against the backdrop of broader Constitutional reforms designed 
to strengthen further the role of a more representative, popularly elected, legislature in overseeing executive 
functions.  Transparency International notes that since 2007, the Government’s “anti-corruption drive has 
earned the support of local civil society organizations”.  Reflecting this, Transparency International’s 
corruption perceptions index (CPI) rating for Tonga has improved more than any other country between 2007 
(when Tonga was first included in the index) and 2009.  Tonga is now ranked 99 out of 180 countries on TI’s 
CPI – and while this provides room for improvement, it also places Tonga in the top quarter of all IDA-
eligible countries.  Bank support will focus especially on strengthening public expenditure management 
systems and policy dialogue to support efforts to reduce discretion in the implementation of business 
licensing legislation.   The Government has moved ahead with a range of PFM reforms over the past few 
years, including the establishment of an internal audit unit and new procurement regulations to be introduced 
in 2010.  A recent Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment led by the Australian 
Government, acknowledged a range of recent improvements in transparency, policy based budgeting, and 
strengthened predictability and controls in budget execution, but which also highlighted the critical 
importance of further strengthening audit functions.  PEFA and PFM issues will need to be a key element in 
any potential further DPO program.  On the structural side, IFC advisory support since 2008 has assisted the 
Government to introduce a new electronic company registry, streamlining procedures required to start a 
business – strengthening the overall governance environment and reducing discretion and opportunities for 
rent seeking.  In the short to medium term, further business licensing reform to reduce ‘reserved’ industries 
and provide greater certainty for potential investors in key sectors of the economy is likely to be especially 
important, although broad progress on this front has been limited to date.   

13 

 
 
 
 
 
Generating Opportunities from Greater Global and Regional Integration 

38. While domestic reform is crucial, greater global and regional integration will also be vital for 
small island states such as Tonga to overcome the constraints of economic geography.  Rather than trying 
to swim against the tide by spreading out economic activity in more remote areas, the 2009 World 
Development Report and initial work by the World Bank on ‘Pacific Futures’ suggests that Pacific island 
countries are more likely to achieve success by carefully planned economic integration, by reducing frictions 
to ensure that peripheries can be more closely connected to economic hubs.   

39. 
The Bank anticipates building on success to date in temporary labor migration schemes, which 
have provided opportunities for thousands of Tongans.  This includes continued support to encourage the 
further expansion of such schemes in the region.  In addition, the Bank anticipates supporting efforts to 
strengthen financial literacy among temporary laborers to help them make the most of opportunities to start 
their own businesses on return.  IFC’s Pacific micro-finance initiative will also potentially be a mechanism to 
support a wide range of budding entrepreneurs, including returned seasonal laborers. 

40. 
The telecommunications revolution in the Pacific has been perhaps the major success story in the 
region in the past 5 years, and an area in which continued World Bank Group engagement is anticipated.  
IFC is exploring options for mobile phone banking in the Pacific, to build on the dramatic expansion in the 
use of mobile telecoms technology in the region.  The next key challenge in the ICT sector will be to 
improve broadband connectivity for many of the smaller islands.  The Bank is working closely with the 
Government, as well as both major telephone service providers in Tonga, ADB and IFC, to explore options 
for a public-private partnership to finance a broadband cable between Tonga and one of the major cross 
Pacific cables.  This might also potentially involve a broader regional network with Samoa, Solomon Islands, 
and Vanuatu.  Just as broadband connectivity has revitalized many small towns in the U.S., this has the 
potential to provide opportunities to people in countries like Tonga to participate in and benefit from the 
global economy.  While the focus will be on maximizing the private investment that can be obtained while 
ensuring that there is open access to bandwidth for all domestic service providers, Bank support for 
remaining Government investments in landing a cable can be provided on grant terms and – due to IDA’s 
regional facility – almost totally in addition to Tonga’s regular IDA allocation. 

41. 
In time, consideration by Tonga of further opportunities for service delivery to be undertaken 
through cooperative regional arrangements could help to generate economies of scale, and the Bank 
stands ready to assist Tongan Government efforts that may emerge in this regard. 

42. 
The Bank Group will support further structural reform by the Tongan Government that could 
encourage new private investment and growth.  Increasing opportunities for small and medium enterprises 
to gain access to finance will be a focus of efforts to encourage greater opportunities from private sector led 
growth.   Only about 20% of small and medium firms throughout the Pacific have access to finance through 
the banking system.  The Bank Group is working around the region to improve financial infrastructure.   In 
Tonga, IFC is currently in discussion with the central bank and commercial banks with the aim of 
establishing a credit bureau, which is a key constraint limiting expansion of financial services.  IFC is also 
engaging at the firm level through the Pacific Microfinance Initiative, to expand outreach and access to 
financial services for the under-served population of the country. IFC has engaged with South Pacific 
Business Development Foundation to assist its proposed plans to expand microfinance operations in Tonga.  
IDA and IFC have been collaborating in PNG to establish a “first loss” facility that could potentially 
encourage commercial banks to increasingly provide finance to the vibrant SME sector, and will explore 
options to replicate a similar facility on a regional basis across the rest of the Pacific islands – for which 
additional regional financing could potentially be made available over and above countries’ standard 
allocations.  IFC is also exploring opportunities to support new tourism and agribusiness investments in 
Tonga, that have scope to encourage growth and employment in these areas where Tonga has a natural 
comparative advantage.

Building Resilience Against Shocks 

43. 
Given the systemic volatility and vulnerability of many of the Pacific island countries, building 
resilience will be a key theme of Bank Group engagement in Tonga and throughout the region.  As well as 
vulnerability to natural disasters, climate change adaptation will be central to development outcomes in the 
Pacific and will become an increasing focus.  Similarly, support to strengthen oil supply chain management 
and open the electricity market to new private sector generation investments, including in renewable energy, 
will reduce vulnerability to potential future oil price shocks. 

44. 
Building on successful reconstruction efforts after Cyclone Waka, the Bank will support 
reconstruction of houses and public buildings on the Niuas islands that were hit by the 2009 tsunami.  An 
emergency reconstruction grant is being presented to the Board in parallel to this CAS, with financing 
additional to Tonga’s normal allocation, and with the scope to retroactively finance work already undertaken 
by the Tongan Government.  As well as reconstruction or rehabilitation of 145 houses, investments will 
support further efforts to strengthen the disaster management and response capacity of the National Disaster 
Management Office.  Investments will be closely coordinated with NZ efforts to provide temporary housing 
through the Red Cross, EC support for the Niuas hospital reconstruction, and NZ support.  Disaster risk 
reduction efforts will be complemented by exploration of the feasibility of a possible catastrophe risk sharing 
facility, as has been established in the Caribbean, as one element in a layered risk management framework 
that could provide a quick response and potentially supplement donor support following natural disasters. 

45. Many of the Pacific islands are on the front line with climate change, and increased and better 
coordinated support for adaptation efforts will be crucial.  The ADB is leading efforts in Tonga under the 
Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR), with the World Bank leading in Samoa.  Japan has also been 
active in this area.  Nevertheless, Tonga is likely to be one of the priority countries for the Global Facility for 
Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR), which will allow the Bank to provide some support for 
integrated adaptation and DRR activities, in coordination with other donors – particularly in support of the 
ADB led PPCR effort.  A key lesson from previous adaptation and disaster risk reduction engagement is that 
such work is likely to have most value if integrated closely with efforts to “climate proof” infrastructure 
investments.  The Bank will also ensure that adaptation measures are built into all infrastructure investments, 
including road transport, energy, and school construction. 

46. 
Good coordination in the infrastructure sector has been achieved through the Pacific Regional 
Infrastructure Facility (PRIF), and this could provide an example to strengthen coordination of the 
variety of donors engaged in supporting climate change adaptation in the region.  Reflecting commitments 
to support adaptation made by countries at the Copenhagen summit, considerable additional support is likely 
to be made available to assist the vulnerable Pacific island countries to adapt to climate change.  While vital, 
better coordination of these flows will be critical.  Australian leadership was crucial to establish PRIF, which 
now includes New Zealand, the ADB, and the World Bank – with the European Union in the process of 
joining.  PRIF has been instrumental in better linking investments to longer-term reforms in the way island 
countries plan, manage, and finance their infrastructure needs.  It has proven an effective mechanism to 
marshal coordinated donor support for investments in economic infrastructure, and as a means to address the 
problem of funding for infrastructure asset maintenance.  In looking at options for better regional 
coordination of climate change, South Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP) – which has been 
tasked by Pacific leaders to play a convening role – will also need to be closely involved. 

47. 
Reflecting the food and fuel price spikes of 2008, efforts to reduce reliance on volatile imported 
fossil fuels and improve energy supply chain management are becoming a larger area of focus, 
particularly in Tonga and the North Pacific.  Early experience in Tonga with the development of an 
integrated “energy roadmap” provides a potential model for donor coordination elsewhere in the region, and 
provides a potential opportunity to strengthen collaboration with non-traditional donors such as China, which 
is a highly competitive supplier of photovoltaic systems.  With reforms focused on providing opportunities 

15 

 
 
 
 
 
 
for new private investment in generation capacity, there is also considerable scope to exploit synergies across 
the public and private sector arms of the Bank Group.  An energy development policy operation, presented 
with this CAS, reflects the significant progress with the roadmap, and accelerated this reform agenda and 
these reforms will be further supported through any potential future DPO program.  The Bank also plans an 
IDA investment, potentially supplemented with PRIF financing, in late FY11 to support these reform efforts. 

48. 
Given the successful experience with Samoan infrastructure management, where the Bank has 
been engaged for over a decade, there is potentially scope during the IDA-16 period to begin a new phase 
the current Tonga transport sector consolidation project.  A key element of Bank engagement in this sector 
– with support from the Australian Government – will be to increase local capacity to undertake road 
maintenance and infrastructure work.  As well as meeting urgent maintenance needs, this will provide 
counter-cyclical employment opportunities for thousands of Tongans.  The Princess Ashika tragedy 
highlights the importance of renewed efforts to strengthen maritime safety.  A new phase of the TSCP during 
IDA-16 is also an opportunity to further mainstream disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation 
issues into infrastructure planning and management.  The Bank Group is also considering initial approaches 
from the Government to support the rehabilitation of airports throughout Tonga as part of a broader strategy 
to open the domestic airline market to great competition. 

49. 
The Bank has successfully supported health and primary education service delivery in Tonga, but 
reflecting principles of selectivity and donor coordination anticipates being less involved in these sectors 
in future.  Tonga is making relatively good progress toward the MDGs, with generally strong social 
indicators.  The Bank has supported service delivery, through the successful health sector support project 
(2003 – 2009) that was undertaken in coordination with Japan and Australia and the continuing education 
support project in conjunction with NZ that has focused on school grants as a mechanism to increase parent 
and teacher oversight of investments at the school level.  There are issues with increasing lifestyle diseases 
and with educational quality.  Nevertheless, there is also very significant – and growing – support from other 
donors for Tongan Government efforts.  The Bank will remain engaged in analytical work, particularly with 
early grade reading assessments financed through the Education for All Fast Track Initiative (EFA FTI) and 
in terms of options to reduce the prevalence of non-communicable diseases.  New investments in the 
education and health sectors are not planned at this stage, although this could be revisited if clear gaps 
emerge and the Government and lead donors in each sector request further Bank support. 

50. 
Gender issues will continue to be mainstreamed into the Bank program.  Gender outcomes in 
Tonga are relatively good.  Maternal and child health care is strong.  There is little difference in school 
enrolment between girls and boys (girls have slightly higher enrolment rates than boys at the secondary 
level).  And while there is almost universal literacy, rates among women are slightly higher than men.  Bank 
health and education programs have supported these outcomes, although other donors are likely to play a 
stronger role in these sectors in future.  Research by the Pacific Institute for Public Policy3 in Vanuatu 
indicates that while men were initially more likely to adopt new communications technology, women quickly 
follow and that telecoms reform has reduced the gender gap between women and men’s access to phones that 
existed prior to market liberalization (although differences still remains significant in rural areas).  The study 
shows a clear link between economic productivity and access to mobile phones, with women successfully 
making use of new opportunities (over 80% of the women in the main market, where women dominate 
activity, are using mobiles to pre-arrange transport, contact suppliers, communicate with clients, and confirm 
payment).  Similar outcomes can be anticipated in Tonga, where women have higher literacy rates and face 
fewer inequalities.  The needs of women are being considered in post-tsunami housing reconstruction plans.  
Experience elsewhere has shown that women also tend to benefit significantly from extended access to 
electricity (as women tend to be prime collectors of fuel otherwise).  Although energy reform in Tonga will 
focus primarily on reducing price volatility (given already high grid access), global experience suggests that

increases in available household income – as would be encouraged by reform – is positively correlated with 
increased spending on education, especially for girls.   

51. 
As well as activities on Tongatapu, the Bank will be ensuring that the program reaches the outer 
islands.  Tsunami reconstruction will obviously be focused on Niuas.  School rehabilitation currently 
underway will include schools in Ha’apai and Vava’u.  Road maintenance investments will include the outer 
islands, and potential support for airports in Ha’apai and Vava’u could be considered in future along with 
potential support for Fua’amoto airport.  Efforts to widen access to the grid – although connection rates are 
generally high – will especially focus on the outer islands. 

Implementation: Partnerships, Selectivity, New Ways of Doing Business, and Accountability 

52. 
As highlighted by leaders in the Compact agreed at the Pacific Island Forum in Cairns in August 
2009, better use of all resources available for development will be required to accelerate progress in the 
region.  This will require policy reform and more stringent public expenditure allocations and controls by the 
island countries.  On the donor side, stronger coordination, greater flexibility, and new approaches to 
building long-term capacity will be important.  It is in the small island states that the issues highlighted by 
the Paris Declaration and the Accra Accords are thrown into starkest relief. 

53. 
The Bank is committed to coordinating more closely with partners in Tonga.  Strong donor and 
government coordination on economic reform issues in Tonga will be especially important, and the Bank 
will contribute to joint analytical work to support a more coordinated policy dialogue.  At the activity level, 
virtually everything we are doing in Tonga is being done in partnership with other donors.  The energy 
roadmap has been one example where the Bank has taken the lead role among donors to support Government 
efforts to improve coordination behind a strategic plan for the sector.  Ongoing education projects are being 
undertaken in close cooperation with New Zealand and the EFA FTI, while current transport investments are 
being implemented in close collaboration with Australia.  The proposed telecoms broadband investment will 
be undertaken in partnership with ADB – potentially the first co-financed activity with ADB in the Pacific.  
Tsunami reconstruction is being undertaken in coordination with UN and NGO support. 

54. While scaling up support for Tonga, Bank Group activities will be highly selective.  The Bank has 
historically provided only about 10% of total development assistance provided to the country, and selectivity 
reflects coordination efforts.  In particular, the Bank Group will be playing an increasing role in economic 
reform dialogue, will continue strong experience in telecoms and energy, and will be looking to replicate 
successful experience elsewhere in the region on transport infrastructure maintenance.  As noted, however, 
Bank engagement in the health and education sectors is anticipated to decline.   

55. 
A central element of Bank Group engagement will be to encourage competition and private sector 
investment in the economy.  The telecoms revolution throughout the Pacific illustrates the potential benefits 
that can be generated by opening markets to competition and new private sector investment.  While a 
broadband cable investment is likely to require public and private investment, the Bank Group will be 
encouraging as much private investment as possible.  A central element of energy sector reform will be 
opening of the generation market to new private sector investors.  A key element of transport sector asset 
management will be to increase local private sector contracting for road maintenance.  ADB has taken the 
lead in the broader discussion of SOE reform in Tonga, and this will be complemented by engagement by the 
Bank Group in the transport and telecoms sectors. 

56. 
Reflecting the particular challenges of small island states like Tonga, we will try to be more 
nimble in project preparation, and give greater attention to implementation support.  The Bank can at 
times be more of an elephant than a lynx.  The EAP region has particularly been characterized by long 
preparation times and, with such a focus on managing risk upstream, limited downstream implementation 
support.  This presents particular challenges for capacity constrained small island states.  Without lowering 

17 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
fiduciary standards, we intend to try to further streamline and accelerate activity preparation, and to 
rebalance Bank engagement toward greater support throughout the project cycle.  To do this, there is scope to 
more fully use the suite of instruments that have been approved by the Board.  The broadband connectivity 
investment will be prepared as a “horizontal APL” that will allow the Bank to roll out similar investments 
elsewhere in the Pacific in response to demand, streamlining preparation costs.  OP 8.00 also allows for 
streamlined procedures for emergency operations, such as Cyclone and tsunami reconstruction support.  And 
there is considerable scope to use additional financing and vertical APL instruments to increase support for 
successful investments and to provide certainty about long-term Bank engagement. 

57. 
A results matrix at Attachment 2 sets out key objectives and anticipated outcomes and provides an 
accountability framework for the Bank Group in its engagement with Tonga.   

Financing Envelope 

58. 
There is scope for the Bank to commit about $50 million in IDA and trust fund resources to 
Tonga over the next four year period.   This would be significantly more than has been provided since 
Tonga joined the Bank until now.  Tonga’s regular allocation during the three year IDA-15 cycle (from FY09 
to FY11) is approximately $7 million.  With proposed changes currently being considered by IDA deputies 
to increase the minimum base allocation received by all countries and remove per capita caps, Tonga’s IDA-
16 allocation (from FY12 to FY14) could increase to perhaps $13-14 million.   On top of this base, additional 
IDA funding has been agreed to support a response to the Niuas tsunami, the proposed energy policy DPO 
will be financed in addition to Tonga’s regular allocation (either through IDA’s crisis response window or 
from reallocations within the department), and most financing for Government involvement in a broadband 
cable could be provided from IDA’s regional pool.  Australian Government funds for road maintenance, and 
additional grant financing through GEF and/or PRIF for investments to support the energy roadmap reforms 
will also increase the total funds available.  An outline of potential new IDA and trust fund commitments 
over the next four years is below.  Inevitably, however, there will need to be a degree of flexibility in 
implementing the program outlined, particularly for the latter half of the CAS period.   IFC remains very 
interested in further private sector investments, although deals will need to be taken opportunistically.

Given Tonga’s debt position, new assistance during the remainder of the IDA-15 period will 
continue to be provided as grants.  Terms will be reviewed on a regular basis.  Should debt indicators 
improve, it is possible that IDA terms for Tonga could revert to concessional credits during IDA-16.

RISKS 

61. 
Risks in Tonga are moderate.  The country is generally making reasonably strong progress toward 
MDGs.  Constitutional reform has eased tensions that erupted in the 2006 unrest.  The composition of a new 
Government following elections scheduled for November 2010 is obviously unknown, although it is likely 
that many new Ministers will have limited executive experience, and this will obviously require significant 
support from the civil service, as well as donor partners and others, in managing the transition period in a 
way that provides both a degree of certainty as well as room for a new Government to implement their own 
priorities and legislative agenda.  Reflecting this, the proposed country assistance strategy has been discussed 
extensively with Government, Parliamentarians, as well as business and civil society to attempt to ensure 
widespread support for the broad agenda outlined.  The Bank Group will also engage closely with any new 
Government on reform issues, and to ensure the program continues to be tailored to emerging priorities.  In 
this context, this CAS is intended to be a living document.  

62. 
Perhaps the most significant country level risk is the volatile economy, and the sustainability of 
reforms efforts.  Tonga has been hard hit over the past few years by commodity price shocks, the global 
economic slowdown, and natural disasters.  Further shocks could put the economy and government finances 
in a very difficult position.  At the same time, this CAS is built around efforts to help the Government to 
improve expenditure efficiency while protecting service delivery, and to support business development.  If 
implemented, such a reform program could ensure that the economy is well placed to bounce back even more 
strongly from current circumstances.  The central focus on DPO instruments reflects both the financial needs 
that the government currently faces as well as a judgment that this could be an effective instrument to 
support real reforms.  Nevertheless, while potentially having high rewards, the use of DPOs carries 
significant risks – including both policy and fiduciary risks.  Mitigating risks will require more extensive 
analysis to underpin a coordinated donor dialogue with the authorities on reform, as well as further support 
for PEFM reform.  In the event that it is not possible to reach agreement with a new Government on a reform 
program to be supported by DPO instruments, we will need to be ready to deploy investment instruments in 
sectors where the Bank has a track record, or where development gains can be made. 

63. 
As in any capacity constrained small island state, investments face implementation risks.  We will 
attempt to address risks through simplicity of design, a greater focus on downstream implementation support, 
a willingness to flexibly restructure activities as needed, and greater use of the instruments available to 
ensure more flexibility and to rebalance support through the project cycle.  Relatively good portfolio 
performance in Tonga in recent years suggests that these issues can be addressed with attention.  As well as 
traditional capacity building support, a key theme running through many investments will be to increase the 
scope for private sector engagement, which has proven elsewhere to be a successful way of overcoming 
constraints on government service delivery in small states.                                                                            .

Pacific Islands: Directions in IDA-15 

Summary 

1. 
This note provides an overview of Bank Group’s approach in the 10 smaller Pacific island countries4 
covered by the Bank’s Pacific, PNG and Timor Leste department5.  The countries are shaped by their 
economic geography, perhaps more so than any others.  Because of their small size and remoteness, the 
Pacific island nations are highly volatile and subject to external economic shocks.  Geographical constraints 
don’t end there. Within many countries, populations are often widely dispersed and located great distances 
from capital cities and economic hubs. This has affected many Pacific island citizens’ ability to participate in 
the formal economy and access services. Likewise, it has eroded many governments’ capacity to deliver 
services to far-flung constituents.   They are also highly vulnerable to natural disasters, with regular cyclones 
and recent tsunamis and flooding. 

2. 
The development situation in the region is mixed.  Although some countries have made relatively 
good progress toward MDGs, progress in other countries has been extremely limited.  In general, most 
countries in the region will not meet most MDGs.  Progress is correlated very closely with domestic policies; 
those countries with stronger institutions and policies that encourage private investment and growth have 
generally achieved better outcomes.  But good domestic policies are a necessary but not always sufficient 
condition for growth.  The Pacific island nations are highly reliant on their relationships with regional and 
metropolitan countries for aid, for investment, and for employment opportunities for their people.  Decisions 
made outside the region also have a significant impact on outcomes. 

3. 
World Bank Group engagement in the Pacific is structured around the themes of: (i) generating 
opportunities through greater global and regional integration, and (ii) building resilience against external 
shocks.  As highlighted by the 2009 World Development Report, Reshaping Economic Geography, countries 
at the margins of the global economy are more likely to achieve success by carefully planned economic 
integration, by reducing frictions to ensure they can be more closely connected to economic hubs, and 
generating opportunities for trade, investment, and growth.  Given the fragile nature of many institutions in 
the region, efforts to build capacity will be mainstreamed throughout the Bank’s program.  This may also 
require a different approach to service delivery, including exploring opportunities for greater regional or sub-
regional cooperation, as well as the potential to increasingly contract service delivery in a transparent and 
competitive manner to the private sector. 

4. 
The World Bank Group is significantly scaling up its engagement with the countries of the Pacific 
region, building on a solid platform put in place over the past couple of years.  Support for the smaller island 
countries is being particularly expanded, reflecting their vulnerability and volatility, and could reach $130 
million during IDA-15 compared to $40-50 million in IDA-13 and IDA-14.  Not only does the Bank 
anticipate providing record levels of IDA and trust fund support to the region during IDA-15, but rapidly 
expanding new IFC investments in the region each year are now broadly equivalent to annual IDA 
commitments.  There is considerable scope for the Bank Group to exploit synergies across both institutions 
to make greater room for the private sector to generate opportunities.  The clearest example of this has been 
the telecoms revolution throughout the Pacific.  Bank support for policy change to promote competition and 
to strengthen regulation has been combined with major investments by IFC to encourage new private market 
entrants.  The end result has been a dramatic increase in connectivity, with mobile phone subscribers 

4   Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Palau, Marshall Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Vanuatu, and 
Tuvalu (which joined the Bank in June 2010).  While Papua New Guinea and Timor Leste share some similar 
development challenges, the focus is primarily on the smaller island countries.   
5    This note is not intended to be a Regional CAS; but is meant to provide an overview of the approach being taken 
across the region in order to provide a broader context for country specific CASs that will be prepared and discussed 
individually with the Board over the next few years.

increasing from 6% to 60% of the population in several countries in the space of a few short years.  
Particularly for remote island communities, this has been life changing. 

5. 
Although the Bank Group is increasing resources to the region, in terms of assistance it remains a 
relatively small player.  As important as finance is the global expertise the Bank Group can bring to build 
coalitions for change with partners – governments, donors, regional bodies, the business community, and 
civil society.  In this, the World Bank Group is committed to the “Cairns Compact” set out by Pacific leaders 
in 2009 to better coordinate all the resources available to encourage development, in order to make tangible 
improvements in the lives of the people of the region. 

Regional Context 

6. 
The economic geography of the Pacific countries shapes their development, perhaps more than 
any other region.  The Pacific islands are, on the whole, considerably smaller and more remote from key 
export markets than even the Caribbean islands.  In total, the countries of the region include approximately 2 
million people, living on hundreds of islands, scattered across an area of ocean equivalent to about 15% of 
the surface of the globe.  This compares to 40 million people the Caribbean, in a sea equivalent to 0.5% of 
the world’s surface area. 

Figure 1: World Bank Pacific Region Member Countries  

7. 
Throughout the region, people face common challenges of remoteness and fragmentation.  The 
countries of the Pacific are marked by their diversity, evident most clearly in the 1,000 language groups 
across Melanesia. “One size fits all” solutions are not appropriate.  The development challenges facing some 
of the larger, resource rich, Melanesian countries, are very different from Polynesian countries like Samoa 
and Tonga, and even more so from the most remote Micronesian countries, which in some cases have total 
populations of less than 20,000 people and very few natural resources beside fish.   

21 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ATTACHMENT 1 

8. 
Although at the margins of the global economy, Pacific countries are highly volatile and 
vulnerable to external shocks.    The Pacific island countries were some of the worst hit in the world by the 
food and fuel price spikes of 2008.  Many of the more remote countries are heavily reliant on imported 
foodstuffs, as well as imported diesel for electricity generation, and transport costs soared.  And the impact 
of the global slowdown, although delayed, is now being felt though out much of the Pacific region.  
Transmission mechanisms have varied from country to country, with the Polynesian countries being affected 
particularly by declining remittances as well as job losses in nascent manufacturing industries; several of the 
Micronesian countries hurt by declining value of trust fund revenues; and others such as Fiji by slowing 
tourism as well as a loss of competitiveness in traditional garment and sugar industries.  The economies of 
most of the Pacific island countries are expected to contract in 2010.  Only PNG and Timor Leste, buoyed by 
continuing demand for their very significant resource deposits, have been largely immune from the 
slowdown to date.  The global crisis has been merely the latest manifestation of more systemic 
vulnerabilities.  The tsunami in Samoa and outlying Tongan islands in September 2009, as well as the series 
of cyclones over the past 6 months in Solomon Islands, Fiji, Tonga and the Cook Islands, also highlighted 
the vulnerability of these countries to natural disasters.  On average, each decade one of the island countries 
in the region has suffered a natural disaster causing damage equivalent to as much as 25% of annual GDP. 

9. 
Mixed development outcomes in the region partly reflect domestic policy and institutional 
performance.   As outlined in Table 1, there have been gains but progress has generally been less than 
hoped.  In most countries, most MDGs are unlikely to be met.  Those countries with the strongest policy 
settings have generally made best progress.  Samoa, for instance, was in the mid-1990s among the first in the 
Pacific to undertake a comprehensive program of structural reforms to strengthen macro-economic 
management, improve the business environment, and deliver services.  Although the country has recently 
been affected by natural disasters and the global slowdown, growth over the past decade has been relatively 
strong – at least compared to other small island states – and it remains on track to meet most MDGs.  
Similarly, policy reform and domestic stability over the past decade has helped to make Vanuatu a “go to” 
tourist destination.  Vanuatu’s improved revenue collection and relatively strong growth allowed the country 
to press ahead with temporary stimulus measures, including infrastructure, in response to the global 
slowdown.  On the other hand, despite some gains in difficult environments such as the Solomon Islands, 
most MDGs will not be met in that country.   

10. Most of the countries of the region are fragile, and sustained development progress is likely to 
require long-term cooperation to build leadership and institutions, as well as manage rapid social and 
economic transitions.  The Pacific region contains one of the highest concentrations of fragile states 
anywhere in the world.  At one extreme, both Timor Leste and Solomon Islands are still emerging from 
conflict.  In Solomon Islands, a low-level conflict from 1998 to 2003 was the result of ethnic divisions 
associated with rapid change, internal migration, and perceived inequities in resource distribution.  In both 
countries, respective Governments invited international intervention to assist in restoring security, and in 
both a very sizeable international presence remains and is responsible in practice for in-line support for 
security and other services.  To differing degrees, however, issues around natural resource sharing, land 
alienation, and unrealized expectations regarding limited government service delivery, are putting pressure in 
many countries on both formal institutions as well as coexisting traditional customary structures, which are 
often the main source for authority outside urban centers.  In several countries, strong national leadership 
will also be important to overcome capacity constraints and build institutions.  Capacity constraints are partly 
a factor of very small populations, but also in some case reflect governance issues.  In such a fragile 
environment, building a coalition and capacity for change in several countries will require a long-term, 
disciplined, and coordinated effort to strengthen representative and accepted institutions that can effectively 
meet the expectations of citizens to transparently and equitably manage the development process.  Of course, 
given the diversity of the Pacific, this will require very different approaches in individual island countries.

11. 
As well as domestic factors, however, systemic volatility also partly reflects the fact that, as a result 
of their geography, most Pacific island economies are narrowly based, with limited diversification.  The 
Micronesians are highly reliant on fisheries, and the Polynesian countries on tourism and remittances.  
Comparative advantages are limited as many of the countries face permanent cost wedges associated with 
their small size and remoteness from markets, making it difficult for the islands to compete in all but a few 
niche markets.   

12. 
In something of a “Pacific paradox”, the island countries are at the periphery of the global 
economy, but remain heavily reliant on relationships with regional and metropolitan countries – through 
investment, trade, remittances and aid.  As noted, those countries that have done well tend to have good 
domestic policies.  But closer integration with the global economy has also brought improved development 
outcomes, although this can also be associated with a degree of volatility.   

 Foreign investment is crucial in allowing countries to make use of natural resources, whether fisheries, 
forestry, resource extraction, our through tourism.  Across the region, foreign direct investment is 
equivalent to approximately 6.5% of GDP, almost double the 3.7% average for developing economies as 
a whole.   

 The small open nature of island economies is evident in the high levels of trade, which averages almost 
80% of annual GDP across the region as a whole compared to less than 60% across all developing 
economies (in fact, total imports and exports are well above 100% of GDP in some of the smaller Pacific 
island economies).  Exports are narrowly based and are primarily commodities (gas and minerals in PNG 
and Timor, forestry in Solomon Islands) and tourism (which is equivalent to over 16% of total GDP in 
the region, and as much as 60% of GDP in countries such as Palau).  Many countries are heavily reliant 
on imports, including for food and energy. 

 Across the region, remittances from foreign nationals make up an average of almost 12% of GDP, 
compared to 2% for developing countries as a whole.  In Tonga, where more nationals live overseas than 
“on island”, remittances are equivalent to about 40% of GDP.  Remittances from have been a major 
benefit, but are also one of the transmission mechanisms through which the economy has been affected 
by the global slowdown. 

 

Island economies are heavily reliant on development cooperation flows, which are equivalent to about 
10-15% of regional GDP.  The North Pacific, which receives significant funding from the Compact of 
Free Association with the US, and Solomon Islands, given the significant size of the Regional Assistance 
Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI), receive some of the highest levels of aid per capita of any 
countries in the world (as much as $1,000 in some of the North Pacific countries).   

13. 
In this environment, good domestic policies and leadership are necessary but not always sufficient 
for progress; external factors are likely to remain crucial to development outcomes in the Pacific.  Good 
macro and structural policies are necessary to ensure that economies are resilient and attract investment, but 
may not be enough by themselves.  Given geographic impediments, the reality that most Pacific countries 
face is that aid will not be a transitional, pump-priming phenomenon.  Even where policy environments are 
strong, continued generous, well-targeted foreign assistance flows are likely to be needed to support current 
levels of service delivery.  Aid may need to be a semi-permanent wedge to offset the tyranny of distance.  
More broadly, greater economic integration, more equitable natural resource agreements, and more open 
labor markets will also be vital for the longer-term future of the Pacific.  Some Pacific island economies are 
unlikely to be economically viable without external financial support and opportunities for citizens to gain 
overseas employment.

Transforming World Bank Group Engagement in the Pacific 

14. 
The Bank Group is scaling up its support for the Pacific islands very significantly.  Concessional 
and grant flows from both the International Development Association (IDA) and trust fund are expected to 
reach over $130 million during IDA-15, compared to $50 million in IDA-14 and $35 million in IDA-13.  
International Finance Corporation (IFC) investments over the same period are anticipated to reach a similar 
amount.

15. 
Reflecting this scale-up, programs in the Pacific islands are likely to make up almost half of the 
total IDA and trust fund support provided by the EACNF department during the IDA-15 period.  Bank 
engagement in Papua New Guinea also increased considerably during IDA-14, and this is expected to be 
maintained during IDA-15.  In Timor, however, significant World Bank engagement immediately after 
independence has now slowed.  Gaining access to potential IBRD financing for both PNG and Timor will be 
a central element in opening scope for greater Bank engagement.

16. World Bank Group engagement has made a real difference in the lives of people throughout the 
Pacific.  Bank Group assistance has helped to strengthen health and education service delivery for villagers, 
improved telecoms and other critical infrastructure, and encouraged new opportunities for people. 

17. World Bank Group engagement is, however, only one small part of the overall effort to improve 
development outcomes in the Pacific region.  While growing, Bank financing is still a relatively modest 
portion of the approximately $2 billion in annual aid flows provided to the region.  And while aid is 
significant, particularly in many smaller countries, it is equivalent to between 10-15% of annual GDP across 
the region – a similar amount to receipts from tourism or remittances.  This reinforces the importance of 
selectivity in Bank Group engagement. 

18. 
The “Cairns Compact” outlined by Pacific leaders at the annual Forum in 2009 reflected the 
importance of better development coordination to improve the effectiveness of all resources – domestic 
and external – available to promote development in the region.  The Bank strongly supports efforts to 
improve the effectiveness and efficiency of development resources through better coordination among both 
donors and governments across the region.  The value of the World Bank’s engagement in the Pacific is not 
principally defined in terms of the size of the lending program, but rather in the extent to which the Bank can 
collaborate with other development partners to transfer global knowledge, build capacity, and provide timely 
technical assistance and analysis that has an impact on Government policy.   

19. 
Although the World Bank Group is far from the largest financier, it potentially brings several 
comparative advantages to its engagement in the Pacific region: 

 The Bank can “bundle” its global expertise and knowledge, and the high quality analytical work it is able 
to bring, with financial resources (either from IDA or other donors) to assist countries undertake policy 
reform and associated institutional change; 

 The Bank Group is able to exploit potential synergies available from its public and private sector arms to 
support policy reform and directly encourage foreign investment in the region; 

 As a perceived impartial actor, the Bank is potentially able to collaborate with both Pacific island 
countries and partners on sensitive issues and to influence broader relationships between the islands and 
regional powers; and 

 Given its convening capacity, the Bank has the scope to undertake complex, large and difficult 
investments. 

World Bank Group: Pacific Engagement Themes 

20. World Bank Group engagement with the broader Pacific region over the next 4-5 years (through the 
IDA-15 and IDA-16 periods) will be structured around the broad themes of: 

(i)  Promoting opportunities from greater regional and global integration; and  

(ii)  Building resilience against shocks, including both economic volatility and climate change and 
associated environmental vulnerabilities.   

21. 
Reflecting the fragility of many countries in the region, a concerted effort to enhance capacity will 
be integrated throughout all aspects of the program. 

22. 
These themes set out a broad structure for engagement; detailed implementation strategies will be 
set out at the country level.  The department anticipates developing more bespoke tailored approaches for the 

26 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
countries previously covered by a single Pacific Regional Engagement Framework.  This reflects the specific 
features, challenges and expectations of the other Pacific island countries.  The first individual strategy for 
these countries was the Solomon islands ISN (April 2010), and a Tonga CAS is anticipated (October 2010) 

Promoting Opportunities from Greater Regional and Global Integration 

23. 
The 2009 World Development Report, Economic Geography and Development, highlights the 
importance of “sea locked’ Pacific island countries becoming more integrated with the global economy if 
they are to overcome the challenge of their geography.  One of the key messages from the WDR is that 
growth is likely to remain geographically unbalanced.  Rather than trying to swim against the tide by 
spreading out economic activity in more remote areas, countries are more likely to achieve success by 
carefully planned economic integration, by reducing frictions to ensure that peripheries can be more closely 
connected to economic hubs.   

24. 
As well as greater global integration, regional cooperation offers significant potential benefits for 
the Pacific countries.  Greater regional and sub-regional cooperation, for instance, potentially offers 
countries the opportunity to strengthen returns from regional resources, such as pelagic fisheries.  And there 
is potentially scope for regional efficiencies in public service delivery, as highlighted by successful efforts 
over the past decade to rationalize and commercialize airline services across the Pacific, by cooperating to 
improve fuel purchases and supply chain management, or regional approaches to strengthen telecoms 
regulation or public sector audit institutions.  The Pacific island countries generally remain less integrated 
than the Caribbean islands.  This reflects in part the greater distances between the Pacific nations, and the 
differing interests of varying Pacific islands.  In this, regional approaches need to be highly sensitive to 
national identities and are likely to require long-term engagement for success. 

25. 
The Bank Group will continue to work collaboratively with clients and partners to help the island 
countries derive greater benefits from closer integration with the metropolitan powers in the region and 
stronger regional cooperation.  Bank engagement will build on the success achieved in working closely with 
Australia and New Zealand – as well as island countries – to assist with the expansion of temporary labor 
migration schemes.   This included the landmark “At Home and Away” report (2006), and technical advice 
to both labor receiving and sending countries.  The New Zealand Recognized Seasonal Employment (RSE) 
scheme has now provided over 9,000 Pacific islanders from Kiribati, Samoa, Tonga, and Vanuatu, with 
opportunities to work in the horticultural industry, returning home with skills and approximately $40 million 
in remittances.  In a win-win situation, the scheme has helped to provide growers with greater certainty of 
labor supply, with Horticulture New Zealand estimating that this has increased output by between $150 – 200 
million.  The Bank will build on this by working with regulatory agencies in Australia and New Zealand to 
reduce the cost of remittances; exploring opportunities for returning workers to use the skills and funds they 
have obtained to open businesses; and by encouraging greater opportunities for skilled migration – as 
Australia is offering to 90 Kiribati nurses currently undertaking their degrees.  More broadly, a flagship 
“Pacific Futures” study anticipated during 2010 will explore options for longer-term integration between the 
island economies and the rest of the world.  As the Pacific Island Forum countries begin negotiations on a 
new regional free trade arrangement, the Bank anticipates undertaking analytical work to assist Pacific island 
countries take advantage of the potential benefits from a more open trade environment, particularly should 
discussions lead to greater opportunities for trade in services and further steps toward a regional labor 
market. 

26. 
Structural economic reform will be vital if the island countries are to participate more fully in 
global growth and attract and benefit from private sector investment.  The Bank Group intends to re-
engage with clients and major development partners in a longer-term dialogue to encourage policy and 
institutional changes needed to attract greater private flows and better use all available development 
resources.   Reforms over the past decade in countries such as Samoa and Vanuatu, for instance, have helped 
to restore macro-economic stability; improve the environment for investment and private sector led growth; 

27 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and strength service delivery.  This has led directly to improved development outcomes.  As well as 
appropriate policy settings, improved governance and policy implementation will also be vital to encourage 
growth and investment. 

27. 
The Bank anticipates working increasingly closely with the IMF, the Asian Development Bank, 
and key bilateral partners to re-engage in a coordinated macro-economic policy dialogue, with associated 
financial support through development policy operations – where needed and where justified by the policy 
environment.  To do so, the Bank will need to rebuild its economic expertise and engagement, which has 
been limited over the past decade as a result of the opportunity costs associated with the temporary labor 
migration work and the difficult experience in adjustment programs in some countries the early parts of the 
decade.  Efforts to rebuild engagement are evident in the key role the Bank has taken with other partners to 
establish a coordinated economic policy reform dialogue with the Solomon Islands’ Government, which has 
already generated an articulation of policy reforms against which Australia, ADB, and EU have provided or 
pledged coordinated support.  In Samoa, the Bank has worked closely with the Government and other 
partners to finance a coordinated reform program to allow the government to respond to tsunami losses and 
the global slowdown.  A similar effort is now underway in Tonga.  More broadly, the Bank expects to 
collaborate more closely with an expanded IMF engagement, having recently joined Fund missions in the 
North Pacific, Fiji, and Tonga.  At the regional level, greater Bank engagement with the IMF’s Pacific 
Financial technical Assistance Center (PFTAC) is envisaged, to provide additional services to Pacific clients 
and build institutional cooperation.  Economic policy dialogue will also be underpinned by IFC technical 
assistance to strengthen the business environment in PNG, Tonga, and Vanuatu.  IFC is also playing an 
increasingly active role in supporting foreign investment in the region, where policy environments are 
appropriate and opportunities exist.   

28. 
Support for countries to strengthen management and gain better returns from the export of 
natural resources will be a growing focus for the Bank Group over the next five years.  In Solomon 
Islands, the Bank anticipates increasing support for these countries to ensure gains from mineral and forestry 
revenues respectively are able to flow through to benefits for citizens.  Discussions on possible participation 
in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) are underway with both governments.  In PNG, the 
Bank and IFC are collaborating to explore options for a risk sharing facility that could help to support local 
firms to participate in the increased economic activity resulting from the construction and operation of the 
potentially transformative LNG project and other major resource projects.  Options will be explored to roll 
out a similar instrument at the regional level across the Pacific region as a whole.  Potential IFC engagement 
in the mining sector in Solomon Islands also offers opportunities to encourage reputable foreign investors in 
this sector.   

29. 
Countries are increasingly requesting support from the World Bank Group to assist them explore 
options to gain a better return from the world’s largest tuna resource.  Even a relatively small increase in 
the 3-4% of the wholesale value of the fisheries catch received by island countries could make a very 
significant difference in the resources available for development.  The Bank anticipates providing support to 
the newly established secretariat of the Parties to the Nauru Agreement (comprising those island countries 
with the largest fisheries resource; as much as 30% of the global tuna stocks) to explore options to improve 
returns while strengthening incentives for sustainable commercial management of the fisheries.  Potential 
support from IFC to could encourage private investment to increase the value added activities associated with 
the fisheries industry in the region.  Engagement will, however, reflect the considerable regional architecture 
already in place in the fisheries sector. 

30.  
The telecommunications revolution in the Pacific has been an outstanding example of the 
potential gains from global integration, and an area in which continued World Bank Group engagement 
is anticipated.  The Bank Group has played a significant role in the past few years in encouraging telecoms 
reform to encourage competition and allow new private sector operators.  The Bank is helping to secure 
reforms by strengthening independent telecoms regulators, with activities in Samoa underway since 2002 and 

28 

 
 
 
 
 
 
new investments this year in Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.  The Bank is also exploring options to assist 
Kiribati and the North Pacific countries potentially open their markets.    At the regional level, the Bank will 
assist efforts to strengthen regulation of competitive telecoms markets by supporting the establishment of a 
Pacific Regional Telecommunications Regulatory Resource Centre.  This will encourage sharing of 
information and industry data, improve awareness of sector performance across the region, and provide 
direct assistance to policymakers and regulators.  Maximizing synergies across the Bank Group, IFC 
investments of about $100 million over the past 3 years in the Pacific islands (excluding PNG) have played a 
key role in encouraging over $200 million in investments by new private sector telecoms operators.  The next 
key challenge in the ICT sector will be to improve broadband connectivity for many of the smaller islands; 
and this is currently being explored by the Bank in conjunction with the Asian Development Bank, with a 
view to mobilizing both public and private sector resources to finance a broadband cable between Fiji and 
Tonga and, potentially, also with Samoa, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu.  Putting in place such infrastructure 
will inevitably require significant degree of regional cooperation.   

Box 1: The Telecoms Revolution in the Pacific 

Telecoms reforms throughout the Pacific in the past five years have yielded enormous benefits for remote 
and far flung communities. 

Most of the Bank’s Pacific island member countries have now opened their telecoms markets to new private 
operators.  This includes Tonga (2002), Fiji (2006), Samoa (2006), Papua New Guinea (2007), Vanuatu 
(2008), and Solomon Islands (2010). 

The resulting competition has seen prices for mobile telephones fall dramatically and coverage improve.  
There has been a rapid increase in mobile telephone use throughout the region.  In Fiji, where reforms 
started, mobile telecoms coverage has increased from 25% to over 75% of the population in 4 years.  In 
Samoa, Tonga, and Vanuatu, about 60% of the population now subscribe to mobile phone services, 
compared to as little as 6% prior to reforms. 

Improved connectivity offers a key opportunity for people in the islands to overcome the tyranny of distance 
and take advantage of global economic opportunities.  Improved telecommunications literally opens up the 
World to those previously disconnected. Connectivity allows fishermen to know where the best price of the 
day is; enables mobile banking services; better connects people to schools and health services, and provides 
entrepreneurs with better information on which to base decisions. 

Building Resilience against Shocks 

31. 
Given the systemic volatility and vulnerability of many of the Pacific island countries to 
exogenous shocks, building resilience will be a key theme of Bank Group engagement.  Just as structural 
economic reform will be vital for the island economies to better participate in and benefit from global 
growth, so too will reform be vital to build resilience.  Those countries with dynamic and entrepreneurial 
private sectors and those able to attract investment are likely to be those able to bounce back the quickest 
from shocks.  Commodity price shocks of 2008 highlighted the need to reduce dependency on highly volatile 
oil prices for energy will important, as will investing in rural development as a front-line defense against 
volatility in food prices.  The Bank will assist countries develop infrastructure and facilities to better prepare 
for environmental and natural disaster risks.  Many of the Pacific islands are on the front line with climate 
change, and support for adaptation efforts will be crucial.  Improved health, education and social investments 
will be vital to make progress toward the MDGs and ensure that people are able to lead fulfilling lives.  And 
all efforts to strengthen resilience and service delivery will need to be underpinned by further support to 
enhance governance and institutional effectiveness. 

29 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
32. 
Reflecting the food and fuel price spikes of 2008, efforts to reduce reliance on volatile imported 
fossil fuels and improve energy supply chain management are becoming a larger area of focus.  The Bank 
is now working with Tonga and the North Pacific countries, and Vanuatu has also expressed interest in 
support to improve oil supply chain management.  Early experience in Tonga with the development of an 
integrated “energy roadmap” provides a model for donor coordination, and provides perhaps the best 
opportunity in the region to strengthen collaboration with non-traditional donors (such as UAE and 
potentially China).  With reforms focused on providing opportunities for new private investment in 
generation capacity, there is also considerable scope to exploit synergies across the public and private sector 
arms of the Bank Group.  In Solomon Islands, for instance, the Bank and IFC are collaborating closely in 
order to encourage a new private hydropower generation investment at Tina River, which will significantly 
reduce reliance on imported diesel.  This complements efforts currently underway through the Solomon 
Islands sustainable energy project to improve operations in the state dominated energy sector. 

33. 
Improving agricultural productivity is being given higher priority, reflecting the predominance of 
rural poverty, especially but not only in Melanesia, and the importance of building resilience from volatile 
global food prices.  Smallholder agricultural production is often the de facto safety net for many villagers. In 
Solomon Islands, for instance, the Government identified rural development as integral to its efforts to 
reestablish lasting peace and security, and rural service delivery is currently the key element of the Bank’s 
program in that country.  Analytical work on strengthening agricultural supply chains in Samoa, and is 
expected to lead to further support.  Tonga has expressed interest in monitoring initial work in Samoa, and in 
replicating this should the Samoa experience prove successful. 

34. 
The Bank anticipates continuing efforts to improve infrastructure asset management, and to 
mainstream disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation into infrastructure planning and 
management.  The Bank has a successful record of working in Samoa and, more recently, in Tonga, to 
strengthen the management of infrastructure assets, which are an essential backbone for economic growth.  
Road maintenance work by local private contractors has also proven an effective response to generate 
employment at a time of global slowdown.  Ensuring that maintenance is fully funded has been a critical 
issue, rather than just continuing inefficient new capital expenditures.  In addition, considerable additional 
support is likely to be made available to assist the vulnerable Pacific island countries to adapt to climate 
change.  This reflects the commitments to support adaptation made by countries at the Copenhagen summit.  
A key lesson from previous adaptation and disaster risk reduction engagement is that such work is likely to 
have most value if integrated closely with efforts to “climate proof” infrastructure investments.  The Bank 
also has successful experience in supporting reconstruction and disaster risk reduction efforts following 
cyclones in Samoa and Tonga, and more recently in response to the tsunami in Samoa and outlying islands in 
Tonga.  Disaster risk reduction efforts will be complemented by further work to explore the feasibility of a 
possible catastrophe risk sharing facility, as has been established in the Caribbean, as one element in a 
layered risk management framework that could provide a quick response and potentially supplement donor 
support following natural disasters. 

35. 
Good coordination in the infrastructure sector has been achieved through the Pacific Region 
Infrastructure Facility (PRIF), and this could provide an example to strengthen coordination of the 
variety of donors engaged in supporting climate change adaptation in the region.  Australian leadership 
was crucial to establish PRIF, which now includes New Zealand, the ADB, and the World Bank – with the 
European Commission in the process of joining.  PRIF has been instrumental in better linking investments to 
longer-term reforms in the way island countries plan, manage, and finance their infrastructure needs.  It has 
proven an effective mechanism to marshal coordinated donor support for investments in economic 
infrastructure, and as a means to address the problem of funding for infrastructure asset maintenance.   

36. 
Translating stronger growth into strengthened service delivery and progress towards MDGs is 
vital if the skills of people are to be fully utilized, and to increase opportunities for people to lead fulfilling 

30 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
lives.  The Bank has worked closely with other donors in the development of sector-wide programs in health 
and education in Tonga, Samoa, and Solomon Islands.  Health and education investments in Samoa and 
Tonga have supported these countries in their successful progress toward the MDGs.  In Solomon Islands the 
Bank-managed Rural Development program has introduced community driven-development approaches to 
rural service delivery while also supporting revitalized agriculture extension services.  This will be backed up 
by joint analysis with donor partners to review the experience with early-stage SWAPs, and incorporate 
lessons into future sector programming.  Given the extensive bilateral support for health and education 
activities in the Pacific, future Bank engagement in these sectors is likely to be focused primarily in 
Melanesia, where MDGs are significantly off track.   

37. 
Providing greater opportunities for women and youth will be important.   While there have been 
recent improvements, in most countries girls remain under-represented in primary school, again particularly 
in Melanesia.  And despite some very high profile women in the region, a gender gap remains in 
representation of women at the most senior levels of government and business.  In many countries, youth 
also comprise more than half the population and are a significant proportion of the poor and vulnerable. In 
Solomon Islands, the Bank will support government to provide training and work experience opportunities to 
thousands of disadvantaged urban youth. This will help improve their individual prospects, education and 
income; contribute to social stability, and match the needs of employees to the local labor market.  As part of 
this, the Bank will be specifically exploring the needs of adolescent girls.   

38. 
Stronger governance and institutions have been identified by leaders in the Cairns Compact as 
vital to improve service delivery and development outcomes.  Building and strengthening the institutions of 
government remains a key priority for many of the young and capacity constrained countries in the region.  
While performance varies widely, World Bank measures of government effectiveness suggest that even the 
better performing countries in the region are only just above global averages.  Perceptions of corruption 
remain high in several countries.  One key element in addressing these challenges will be to improve public 
financial management.  Without addressing PFM issues, interventions in key sectors of infrastructure, health 
and education will tend to be project-based, ring-fenced and ultimately unsustainable.  There is potentially a 
significant role for the Bank to work with clients to improve the overall functioning of government and 
public sector institutions.  The Bank is also committed to supporting the Pacific Regional Audit Initiative, 
which is a Pacific Plan initiative and was endorsed by Forum Leaders in 2008.  The Bank will provide 
financial and technical support for the Pacific Association of National Audit Institutions (PASAI) to support 
PASAI improve the quality and timeliness of the audit in some members with lesser capacity and to 
developing a medium term plan to strengthen audit skills in the region.  Increasing Bank engagement in this 
area will need to be coordinated closely with the Pacific Association of National Audit Institutions (PFTAC) 
and the ADB, as well as key bilateral partners, which also have a long-term engagement in these issues. 

Enhancing Capacity and New Ways of Doing Business 

39. 
Given the fragile nature of many of the countries in the region, building leadership and 
institutions needed to manage change will require a longer-term effort to enhance capacity.  The situation 
across the region varies greatly.  In most countries there is considerable expertise at the senior levels of 
government, although thin, and impressive recent graduates emerging.   But most partner governments face 
real problems in attracting and retaining domestic expertise, and this is likely become more marked as their 
economies further globalize.  Several depend for core governance functions (policy setting, financing, 
expenditure management, security) on external partnerships. Many services are 'co-produced' with external 
partners. This dependence on external service providers will continue to increase, and as transnational 
investments in resource exploitation increase, new kinds of high-end regulatory expertise will be required. 

39. 
Given the vital need to strengthen capacity throughout the region, this issue will be mainstreamed 
throughout the program.  Building capacity and ensuring the sustainability of investments will be more 
successful if addressed at the design stage for all interventions, rather than treated as a separate standalone 

31 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
activity.  The Bank’s long-term engagement for over a decade with the Samoan Government to strengthen 
infrastructure asset maintenance, for instance, has significantly strengthened capacity in this area. Different 
approaches to strengthening capacity will also require exploring opportunities for greater regional or sub-
regional cooperation in service delivery.  Greater use of competitive and transparent contracting of service 
delivery functions to the private sector also provides scope to improve outcomes (for instance, local 
contracting of maintenance functions to the private sector, and with opening the telecoms and generation 
markets to new private investment). 

41. 
The Bank will work with partners to explore opportunities to strengthen capacity at the regional 
level.   The Bank is one of the partners supporting the Pacific Association of National Audit Institutions, as 
well as the Pacific Regional Telecommunications Regulatory Resource Centre.  These offer opportunities to 
share experience and build capacity across the region on these key issues.  Anticipated Bank technical 
placements with PFTAC will help to ensure that countries are able to access financial sector technical 
assistance.  The Bank intends to work with Australia and other partners to explore the potential scope to 
replicate in the Pacific successful initiatives elsewhere in the world, such as the African Economic Research 
Consortium, a not-for-profit organization devoted to advanced policy research and economics training. 

42. 
Nevertheless, effective capacity building is an area in which a renewed effort is potentially 
required from both island countries and partners.  Further support is needed to build credible national 
educational institutions and enhance academic and professional capacity, which are essential building blocks 
to strengthen national institutions.  Stronger public financial management and governance arrangements will 
be vital to increasingly move toward using country systems in the delivery of development assistance, and to 
move away from “ring-fenced” donor investments.   More broadly, the Bank’s Pacific Futures work may 
provide a chance to consider in a more systematic way: (i) the scope for greater regional collaboration in 
delivery of some services, including how some countries and partners are strengthening government-to-
government links to improve service delivery; (ii) options to translate the extensive international technical 
assistance being provided to the region into longer-term institutional capacity; and (iii) opportunities 
available from contracting out service delivery functions to the private sector in a transparent and 
competitive environment with the government increasing focused on ensuring a level playing field rather 
than directly providing services. 

43. 
Portfolio performance throughout the Pacific broadly reflects the operating environment in 
differing countries.  Portfolio performance in Samoa and Tonga has generally been strong, with the Bank’s 
Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) confirming that all 5 activities exiting the portfolio since 2000 have 
been broadly satisfactory in achievements.  In contrast, in less strong policy environments, the Bank’s 
portfolio in the Pacific region has a mixed history.  While indicators suggest that the implementation of the 
current portfolio is now proceeding relatively well (problem and risk projects in the department are 
especially concentrated in Timor rather than the Pacific islands), a range of activities still remain at risk.  
Performance records in the region highlight the importance of keeping project designs simple and realistic, 
strong supervision, and extensive procurement and fiduciary support given capacity constraints in these areas 
in many clients.  Particularly as the Bank looks to expand engagement in non-traditional clients, it will be to 
keep these principles in mind, as well as to focus on areas in which the Bank already has a proven track 
record of success elsewhere in the region. 

44. 
The Bank will need to be creative about new ways of doing business if we are to effectively meet 
the needs of small clients to respond quickly and in a less bureaucratic way.  In particular, this will require 
a shift in balance from upstream risk mitigation to downstream risk management.  We will need to 
significantly expand the implementation support we are able to provide, including more “hand holding” by 
our teams during project implementation to address issues as they emerge and downstream risk management 
as well as upstream risk mitigation.  This will require an increase in supervision resources, as well as greater 
on the ground presence – particularly a focus on development for our local staff and counterparts.  Greater 
fiduciary support will be especially important, and we are moving to increase our own capacity in this regard.   

32 

 
 
 
 
 
 
44. 
Similarly, we need to move away from a “projects based” approach to provide longer-term, policy 
driven assistance in a more flexible way.  This will be a multi-year agenda…but is critical and can be 
started now.  In order to respond faster and more effectively to client needs, further efforts will be required to 
make use of the flexibility provided by the range of Bank instruments.  Additional financing instruments and 
the use of streamlined crisis response processes allowed us to respond flexibly to the tsunami in Samoa in 
FY10.   During FY11, we intend to use a “horizontal APL” to seek Board agreement to a program of regional 
broadband connections for differing clients.  This instrument allows individual country investments to be set 
within a broader regional context, streamline requirements for each individual investment, and potentially 
helps to allow access to additional regional IDA financing over and above individual country allocations.  A 
similar approach could potentially also make sense for climate change adaptation, petroleum supply chain 
management, and transport investments, which have been sought by a range of our Pacific clients.  Similarly, 
the successful experience in transport in Samoa over a decade and in agriculture in PNG over two decades 
highlights the importance of long-term engagement, and “vertical APLs” might be one mechanism that could 
be increasingly used in future to provide greater certainty on long-term engagement in these areas.  

Country Focus 

45. 
In scaling up, the Bank will be looking both to deepen engagement with more traditional Pacific 
island clients, such as Solomon Islands, Samoa and Tonga, as well as widen the program to scale up in 
non-traditional clients such as Vanuatu, the North Pacific, and Tuvalu.  

46. 
In Solomon Islands, World Bank Group engagement is transitioning from post-conflict assistance 
to focus on longer-term reform and development efforts.  This represents the particular challenges of the 
Solomon Islands, which are still emerging from the tensions of the early part of this decade, and in which 
there is still a very large international military, policing and civilian presence through the Regional 
Assistance Mission for the Solomon Islands (RAMSI).  As with other Melanesian countries, Solomon Islands 
society is highly fragmented.  The opening of a World Bank Group office in late 2008, led by a Country 
Manager, has been accompanied by a significant increase in activity.  The Bank invested $20m in IDA and 
trust funds during IDA-14, and expects a similar amount of business in IDA-15.  The single largest project, 
making up over half of the current portfolio, is the Solomon Islands Rural Development Program, which 
commenced in 2008. The program aims to improve standards of living in rural areas through small-scale 
infrastructure, revitalized agriculture extension services, and promotion of rural enterprises. Since the 
opening of the office, three entirely new project and two major new pieces of analytical work have been 
added, including the Sources of Growth report and a Public Expenditure Review.  In addition the WBG has 
played an important role in dialogue, particularly on economic reform issues. Significant co-financing has 
been mobilized to support these activities, illustrating the fact that trust funds currently make up a larger 
proportion of the portfolio than IDA.  There is scope for the Bank to potentially back up this dialogue with 
policy based support for the government, although this will depend critically on the policy environment that 
emerges in the country during the course of what is an election year.  In collaboration with IFC, the Bank is 
engaging with the Solomon Islands Government in policy dialogue on resource management issues, and in 
encouraging reputable private investors to the minerals sector.  IFC invested $35m in FY09 to assist with the 
restarting of production at the Goldridge mine.  The Bank is working with IFC to assist in the reform of the 
energy sector. This includes management reform of the Solomon Islands Electricity Authority, essential to 
attracting private sector investment in the Tina River Hydro scheme. For Tina River, IFC is providing 
transaction advice to Government, while the Bank and other donors are supporting Government in the overall 
management and coordination of this complex but vital project.   

47. 
The Bank has provided extensive support to Samoa’s successful reform program since the mid-
1990s.  Samoa, like Tonga, is a highly structured and cohesive Polynesian society.  Longer term reform 
efforts over almost two decades have helped Samoa raise the speed limit for growth and improve social 
indicators (it is now broadly on track to meet most MDGs).  Reflecting reform efforts, the Bank has had the 
most extensive engagement with Samoa of all Pacific island countries, providing a total of $100m in 

33 

 
 
 
 
 
 
financing since the country joined the Bank.  Nevertheless, Samoa was hit hard in FY09 by the global crisis 
and by a devastating tsunami in September 2009.  In response, the Bank more than doubled the available 
IDA-15 resources to $40 million.  Following the tsunami, Bank staff were in Samoa within 48 hours to work 
collaboratively with the Government and donors to prepare a comprehensive damage and loss assessment.  
The Bank worked closely with the Government and other partners to ensure a coordinated set of policy 
actions to underpin financing support for this well performing country in response to the tsunami and the 
effects of the global slowdown.  The Bank will expand support for health and transport operations in 
tsunami-affected areas, building on successful interventions in these sectors over a long-period.  Looking 
ahead, future engagement will focus on strengthening agricultural competitiveness, and further work to build 
on successful investments to improve infrastructure asset maintenance, and “climate proofing” investments. 

48. 
Tonga is undergoing major Constitutional reforms as part of a transition from an absolute to a 
constitutional monarchy.  Over the past few years, Tonga has embarked on a program of economic reform, 
and has made good progress toward most MDGs.  Like Samoa, Tonga has been hard hit by the global 
slowdown as well as the previous food and fuel price spikes.  The Bank is preparing, in conjunction with 
other partners, a package of support to assist the Government respond to the effects of the global slowdown.  
The Bank is also replicating the successful experience with infrastructure maintenance in Samoa, and is 
receiving significant financing from the Australian Government to support local road maintenance activities 
as a means to provide employment opportunities given slowing growth.  The Bank is working with the 
Government and other partners to prepare a comprehensive energy road map and to explore options for a 
broadband cable connection to improve connectivity.  These activities will require close collaboration 
between partners.  Potential IDA and trust fund assistance of about $40-50 million to Tonga during the IDA-
15 and IDA016 period compares favorably with the $33 million provided by the Bank since Tonga became a 
member in 1982.  Tonga will be the first Pacific island country in which the Bank Group will prepare an 
individual country assistance strategy. 

49. 
Given strong policy performance in Vanuatu, the Bank is actively exploring options to increase 
support.  Current Bank Group engagement with Vanuatu is focused on strengthening regulatory oversight of 
the telecoms regulator as well as water and electricity utilities.  Technical assistance is also being provided 
by IFC for successful efforts to strengthen the business environment, and by the Bank on sensitive land 
issues.  The Bank’s engagement in Vanuatu is being supported by the Australian government.  Although 
Vanuatu last borrowed from the Bank in 1991, the Government has expressed interest in potentially 
accessing IDA to assist with the landing of a broadband cable, as well as in petroleum supply chain 
management and other key infrastructure investments. 

50. 
The Bank is responding to requests from Kiribati for additional financial and analytical support.  
Comprised of remote atolls, Kiribati is extremely vulnerable to climate change.   GEF financed adaptation 
work being undertaken in conjunction with Australia and New Zealand is anticipated to continue and be 
integrated even more closely with other investments.  The Bank and ADB intend to jointly explore the 
feasibility of strengthening transport infrastructure asset management in Kiribati, particularly maintenance of 
the main road.  GEF financing is potentially available for a grid-connected solar system in Tarawa to reduce 
reliance on imported diesel, while oil supply chain management work in the North Pacific also holds 
potential for Kiribati.  At the request of the Government, the Bank is providing analytical advice regarding 
options to open the mobile phone market to competition given the benefits elsewhere in the region, and could 
potentially provide financing support if needed to support outer islands connectivity.  Board approval for the 
first ever IDA investment in Kiribati is anticipated during FY11.   

51. 
Like Kiribati, the other Micronesian countries of RMI, FSM and Palau are some of the most 
remote and isolated communities in the world.  These countries rely largely in their fisheries resources, and 
the Compact of Free Association with the United States.  Bank staff anticipate seeking Board approval in 
later 2010 to make IDA resources available for the first time to FSM and RMI.  The Bank has been working 
with both these countries, as well as Palau, on options to strengthen oil supply chain management, and PRIF 

34 

 
 
 
 
 
 
financed technical assistance will be provided to both RMI and FSM to respond to requests for assistance to 
reap the benefits of telecoms competition.  The Bank is also working increasingly closely with the IMF to 
engage in a dialogue on broad economic management. 

52. 
Tuvalu is the Bank’s most recent member country, having joined in June 2010, and is also the 
smallest, with 10,000 people.  During FY10, staff anticipate seeking Board approval to classify Tuvalu as an 
IDA country.  Proposed changes to the IDA allocation formula for IDA-16 could also potentially allow the 
Bank to make about $10 million available to Tuvalu over that period.  Assistance will be very selective, and 
focused on replicating successful investments elsewhere in the region (telecoms, transport, energy) and on 
supporting successful investments by other donors already active in Tuvalu.  Given capacity constraints close 
coordination by the bank with other partners will be especially important. 

53. 
Fiji is facing structural economic difficulties as a result of the longer-term decline of the sugar 
and garment industries, which relied in part on preferential trade access.  There has also been some 
redirection of tourist flows away from the country, partly as a result of political uncertainty associated with a 
series of coups over the past 20 years.  Current World Bank engagement with Fiji is undertaken in 
accordance with OP 7.30, which sets out policy for engaging interim governments.  The Bank is currently 
implementing a GEF financed sustainable energy financing investment in Fiji, and is providing technical 
advice on telecoms reform, the management of the national provident fund, options to better target social 
safety net systems, and broader economic issues.  

Backing-Up an Expanded Program with Expertise 

54. 
Underpinning the World Bank Group’s expanded engagement with the broad Pacific region is a 
strengthened backbone of decentralized offices, building client relations and allowing the rapid 
deployment of sectoral expertise. 

 The Sydney office has now become a real hub for technical expertise able to be deployed by both the 
Bank and IFC.  Approximately 50 staff are now based in Sydney across both institutions, more than 
double the number a few years ago.  This includes over a dozen international staff and an expanded 
complement of Australian-hired professionals. 

 A new country manager position was placed in Solomon Islands in FY09, complementing country 
managers leading offices in Timor and PNG.  Country offices have been expanded significantly, 
including by the placement of internationally recruited deputies in Dili, Honiara, and Port Moresby. 

 A structure of “lean and mean” liaison offices are being opened jointly with the Asian Development 
Bank through the Pacific to strengthen client interactions.  Such offices are now open in Samoa and 
Tonga, and are underway in Vanuatu and, potentially, Kiribati.  These are the only places anywhere in 
the world where the ADB and the World Bank share staff. 

55. 
Generous support from Australia and New Zealand has been crucial to allow the expanded 
staffing presence supporting expanded engagement.  Arrangements for this support will need to be renewed 
in FY11 if the current staffing profile is to be continued.
