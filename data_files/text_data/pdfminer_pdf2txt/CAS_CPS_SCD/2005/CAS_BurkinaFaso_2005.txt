BURKINA FASO: COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY FYO6-09 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

1. 

Bu rk ina Faso’s track reco rd o n r e f o rm and g row th in the past decade has been laudable, with rea l 
GD P increas ing by an average o f 5.6 percent pe r annum in the 1994-2004 period, accelerating to more 
than 6.0 percent pe r annum in recent years. This has resulted in an estimated 8 percent decline in the 
pove r ty headcount between 1998 and 2003 -- led by cotton-producing ru ra l areas. This recent progress i s 
in ma rked contrast to prev ious decades o f p o l i c y va r iab i l i ty and poo r g row th that have l e f t Bu rk ina one o f 
the poorest countries in Afi-ica, with per capita income o f $350 and a pove r ty inc idence o f 46 percent in 
2003. Soc ia l we l fare indicators lag behind even modest Sub-Saharan averages, p lac ing Bu rk ina near the 
bo t tom o f the Human Development Index. T w o o f every f ive ch i ldren are ma lnour ished and are no t 
a t tend ing school. 

Long-term vision for growth and poverty reduction. T h e country’s land locked location, limited 

2. 
resource base, sma l l in terna l marke t (12.4 m i l l i o n inhabitants) and und ive rs i f ied economy -- in wh ich 
co t ton exports continue t o p rov ide 55-70 percent o f export earnings -- shape the long - te rm v is ion fo r 
g row th and pover ty reduction. T o attain the six percent plus rea l g row th rates needed t o s ign i f ican t ly 
reduce poverty, the coun try needs to pursue a v is ion based on reg iona l economic integration, agr icu l tura l 
d ive rs i f ica t ion and intensification, 
land and ‘water management fo r enhanced p roduc t iv i ty , agro- 
processing, trade and export enhancement, human cap i ta l and labor p roduc t iv i ty , and g loba l connectivity. 
Reg iona l economic in tegra t ion w i l l be c r i t ica l fo r reduc ing transport and energy costs, expanding markets 
for trade, tak ing advantage o f economies o f scale in processing activities, deve lop ing v iab le service 
industries, p romo t ing fore ign d irec t investment, enhancing the qua l i ty o f advanced education and 
encouraging labor mob i l i ty . Bu rk ina w i l l also need to make op t ima l use o f i t s l im i t e d na tura l resource 
base to expand export earnings, exp lo i t ing the po ten t ia l to diversify i n t o h igher-va lue agr icu l tura l crops, 
develop extractive industries, promo te a nascent eco-tourism industry and -- with su f f ic ien t human cap i ta l 
development -- become a hub fo r sub-regional p rov is ion o f economic services. 
Burk ina ’s long- term v is ion i s the founda t ion fo r the 
country’s Pover ty Reduc t ion Strategy. In 2000, Bu rk ina became one o f the f i r s t countries t o prepare a 
full pove r ty reduc t ion strategy, o r Cadre Stratdgique de Lutte contre la Pauvretd (CSLP).’ A rev ised 
CSLP fo r 2004-2006 was discussed at a Dono r Roundtable in M a r c h 2004, adopted by Government in 
November 2004 and presented to the W o r l d B a n k Boa rd a long with a fifth Pove r ty Reduc t ion Support 
Opera t ion in M a y 2005. T h e rev ised CSLP builds o n the m a i n objectives o f the earlier strategy, a im ing 
to: i) accelerate equity-oriented grow th ; ii) increase access o f the poo r t o basic soc ia l services; iii) expand 
income and employment opportunities fo r the poor; and iv) promo te good governance. I t sets ou t three 
overarch ing med ium- term goals: to increase rea l GDP per capita by at least 4 percent per annum 
beg inn ing in 2004; t o reduce pove r ty incidence f r om 46 percent t o less than 35 percent by 2015; and to 
raise l i f e expectancy t o at least 60 years by 2015 through reductions in in fan t , c h i l d and maternal 
mo r ta l i ty . 

3. 

Revised poverty reduction strategy. 

4. 
Near-term growth prospects. T h e Bu rk inabe economy i s vulnerable t o a var ie ty o f exogenous 
shocks that undermine prospects fo r g row th in the short t e rm . The curren t down tu rn in w o r l d co t ton 
pr ices and appreciation o f the Eu ro to the U .S . do l la r poses a serious risk t o Bu rk ina ’s cotton-dependent 
economy. Las t year’s reg iona l locus t infestations con t inue t o threaten ag r icu l tu ra l p roduc t ion and food 
security. Ins tab i l i ty in ne ighbo r ing countries in recent years has underm ined reg iona l in teg ra t ion efforts,

increased transport costs and tarnished the investment climate across the sub-region. Faced with mu l t ip le 
shocks, the Burk inab t? economy i s expected to g row by on ly 3.5 percent in rea l terms in 2005. 

5. 
Lessons from past support to Burkina. T h e 2000 Coun t ry Assistance Strategy supported 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the i n i t i a l CSLP. The CAS Comp le t ion Repor t annexed to this CAS concludes that 
development outcomes in this pe r iod were satisfactory, as was Bank performance in supporting 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the strategy. Key lessons f r om the past C A S have shaped the strategy fo r FY06-09 . 
First, strong coun t ry comm i tmen t and consistent po l icy r e f o rm have succeeded in creating an 
environment mo re conducive to grow th . Second, a more aggressive approach to economic d ivers i f ica t ion 
and adm in is tra t ive decentralization w i l l be requ ired in order to accelerate g row th and make i t more 
inc lus ive . Third, t h e C A S needs to do more to support strengthening o f na t iona l capacity and coun try 
systems, in order t o get be t te r results and sustain them. F ina l ly , IDA and other external par tners must use 
the next few years t o translate pr inc ip les o f harmon iza t ion in to rea l i ty , in order to reduce the burden o f a id 
management fo r Bu rkma . 

6 . 
IDA ’S partnership with Burk ina in FY06-09. T h i s C A S w i l l support the p i l la rs o f the revised 
CSLP with ana ly t ic work, technical advice, on-go ing operations and new financing. I t i s built around a 
r e s u l t s framework that exp l ic i t ly defines 
the assumed causal links between IDA -suppo r ted activities, 
d irec t outcomes o f these ac t iv i t ies and the country’s h igher- leve l development outcomes. IDA w i l l seek 
to contribute to the f o l l ow i n g outcomes:

0 Accelerated and shared growth. IDA w i l l support enhanced reg iona l integration, expanded 
and d ive rs i f ied export earnings, an imp roved investment climate, decentralized urban 
development to promote urban-rural linkages, and economic in fras truc ture needed to reduce 
factor costs and stimulate pr iva te sector investment and grow th . 
Improved access to basic social services. IDA w i l l continue t o support access to basic 
education and imp roved qua l i ty o f teaching, expanded coverage o f basic hea l th care and 
HIV/AIDS preven t ion and treatment and increased access to clean water and sanitation, 
pa r t icu la r ly in urban areas. IDA w i l l also p rov ide technical input fo r better targeting o f social 
pro tec t ion t o the mos t vulnerable groups. 
Increased employment and income opportunities for the poor. A two-pronged approach 
w i l l focus, f i r s t , o n the labor marke t and emp loymen t strategy f o r u rban workers. Second, 
IDA w i l l support e f for ts to reduce risk, increase revenues, upgrade economic and marke t 
infrastructure and enhance women’s opportunities in r u r a l areas, a long with p romo t ing 
community-based land and na tura l resource management fo r sustainable development. 
Better governance with greater decentralization. Governance affects the achievement o f 
development outcomes across a l l strategic p i l la rs and sectors. E f fo r ts to enhance governance 
and accoun tab i l i ty w i l l be in tegra l t o a l l IDA -suppo r ted ac t iv i t ies . Particular emphasis w i l l 
be placed o n supporting a more e f f i c i e n t jud ic ia ry , p romo t ing pub l ic resource management 
and increased decentralization and strengthening loca l capacity and par t ic ipa t ion in pub l ic 
p o l i c y decisions.

Conclusion. Bu rk ina Faso faces some daunting challenges and r i s k s during the upcom ing CAS 
period, n o t least o f w h i c h i s the uncertain evo lu t ion o f the w o r l d market pr ice fo r cotton, w h i c h places a

I. COUNTRY CONTEXT AND VISION 

investment 

1. 
F rom independence through revolution. In the tw o decades after independence (1 960- 1980), 
the landlocked, fo rme r French co lony o f Haute Vo l ta sustained g row th o f rea l per capita income of 1.2 
pe rcen t per annum. In 1982, the country entered a revo lu t ionary phase and was renamed Bu rk ina Faso.2 
Econom ic po l ic ies were mode led o n Pan-A fr ican socialist theory, and inc luded a strong emphasis o n 
in human development, 
food self-sufficiency, equitable 
income d is t r ibu t ion and 
na t iona l iza t ion o f p r iva te sector en t i t ies . Food produc t ion expanded and strong progress was made in 
l i teracy and basic education. The revo lu t ion also instilled a greater sense o f na t iona l identity, increased 
coun try ownersh ip o f the development process, reliance o n par t ic ipa tory approaches and an emphasis o n 
personal respons ib i l i ty and accountability that have served the coun try well in years since. However, 
poo r macroeconomic and f isca l management, as well as po l ic ies discouraging p r iva te sector investment, 
had serious consequences fo r growth. An overvalued currency within the common currency zone 
exacerbated this problem, and rea l per capita g row th f r om 1980 t o 1994 (a turning po in t in w h i c h the 
currency was devalued by 50 percent) was a dismal -0.5 percent pe r annum. 

Rectification and reform. 

2. 
A change o f regime in 1987 launched a “rec t i f ica t ion” o f the 
revo lu t ion , inc lud ing a shift toward more market-oriented economic po l ic ies and re-engagement with the 
in terna t iona l commun i ty . The Government o f President B la ise CompaorC-who was elected in 199 1 and 
again in 1998 -- imp lemen ted po l ic ies o f trade, market and p r ice l ibe ra l iza t ion with support fo r structural 
re form f r om the W o r l d Bank and other development partners. A l though g row th began to accelerate 
fo l low ing the devaluation, available data indicate l i t t l e change in pover ty incidence in the late 199Os, as 
well as stagnant social indicators o n hea l th and education through the 1990s. Weak g row th over more 
than three decades also resu l ted in an unsustainable debt overhang by the late 1990s when Bu rk ina Faso 
became one o f the f i r s t countries e l ig ib le fo r the H igh ly - Indeb ted Poor Countries in i t ia t ive . 

3. 
Recent progress. Burk ina ’s track record o n re fo rm and g row th since 1994 has been laudable, 
with rea l GD P increas ing by an average o f 5.6 percent pe r annum in the 1994-2004 decade, despite 
continued vu lne rab i l i ty to exogenous shocks. Per capita income g row th increased over prev ious per iods 
to around 2.6 percent per annum, con t r ibu t ing to an estimated 8 percent dec l ine in the pover ty headcount 
between 1998 and 2003 -- l e d by co f ion-produc ing r u r a l areas.3 D e s p i t e this recent progress, Bu rk ina 
remains one o f the poorest countries in A fr ica , with per capita income o f $350 and a pover ty incidence o f 
46 percent in 2003. F o r i t s 12.4 m i l l i o n inhabitants, many soc ia l we l fare ind ica tors lag behind modest 
Sub-Saharan averages and ch i ldhood ma lnu t r i t ion seems to be o n the rise, despite stable measures o f 
inequa l i ty in the past decade o f grow th .

Long-term vision. Bu rk ina Faso‘s pove r ty reduc t ion strategies are roo ted in an earlier 
Sustainable Human Deve lopmen t Strategy and the Bu r luna 2025 v is ion ing exercise conducted in 1998. 
The country’s land locked location, limited resource base, sma l l in tema l marke t and und ive rs i f ied 
economy -- in wh ich co t ton exports continue to p rov ide 55-70 percent o f expor t eamings -- shape the 
long- term v is ion fo r g row th and pove r ty reduction. T o a t ta in the six percent plus rea l g row th rates needed 
to s ign i f ican t ly reduce pover ty , the coun try needs t o pursue a long - te rm v is ion based o n reg iona l 

B u r k i n a Faso translates as “the l a n d o f peop le w i t h in tegr i ty” . 
To measure pove r ty trends, the government has conducted househo ld s u r v e y s in 1994, 1998, and 2003 to co l lec t 
in fo rma t ion o f househo ld consump t ion and incomes. Ove r time, t h e data co l lec t ion process has improved, b u t 
changes made to survey design have also reduced the compa rab i l i ty o f d i f fe ren t su rveys , thus the need to

11. BURKINA FASO’S POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY 

5 . 

In 2000, Bu rk ina became one o f the f i r s t countries to prepare a full Pover ty Reduc t ion Strategy, 
o r Cadre Stratdgique de Lu t te con tre l a Pauvretd (CSLP).4 Progress Reports have been produced fo r 
each year o f the i n i t i a l CSLP.’ Upda t ing o f the CSLP began in early 2003, and inc luded decentralized 
preparation o f 13 reg iona l CSLPs as inputs to the na t iona l leve l strategy, as w e l l as increased pa r t ic ipa t ion 
o f the p r iva te sector, c i v i l society groups and parliamentarians. T h e dra f t CSLP fo r 2004-2006 was 
fo rma l ly discussed at a Dono r Roundtable in Ouagadougou in M a r c h 2004. On the basis o f th is draft, a 
P r io r i ty A c t i o n P lan (PAP) was prepared to better translate strategic d irec t ion in to sequenced actions and 
strengthen results-based mon i to r ing and eva lua t ion o f the CSLP. The rev ised CSLP and accompanying

P A P were adopted by Government in November 2004, and presen ted to the W o r l d Bank Boa rd along 
with the fifth Pover ty Reduc t ion Support Cred i t in M a y 2005. 

A. Country Priorities and Progress 

6 . 
The i n i t i a l CSLP de f ined the fo l low ing four strategic p i l lars : 1) accelerating equity-oriented 
grow th ; 2) guaranteeing access o f the poo r to basic social services; 3) expanding emp loymen t and income 
opportunities fo r the poor; and 4) p romo t ing good governance. P n o r i t y areas were de f ined within this 
b road framework, and inc luded basic education, health, water supply and r u r a l development (including 
food security). Pub l ic consultations in 2003 to assess progress and update the CSLP con f i rmed the 
con t inued relevance o f the four strategic pillars, and articulated add i t iona l p r i o r i t y areas, inc lud ing pr iva te 
sector and SME development, pro tec t ing the environment, imp rov ing living cond i t ions through sanitation 
and r u r a l energy, combating HIV/AIDS, imp rov ing pub l ic safety and building na t iona l capacity and 
access to in fo rma t ion technology. The rev ised CSLP sets ou t three overarch ing medium-term goals: to 
increase rea l GDP per capita by at least 4 percent per annum beginning in 2004; to reduce pover ty 
incidence f r om 46 percent to less than 35 percent by 2015; and to raise l i f e expectancy to at least 60 years 
by 20 15 through reductions in infant, c h i l d and maternal mor ta l i ty . 

7 . 

This CAS prov ides a b r i e f overv iew o f imp lemen ta t ion progress to date under the fou r strategic 
p i l la rs . M o r e detailed discussion can be found in the revised CSLP and other recent d o c um e n k 6 

Pillar One: Accelerating Equity-oriented Growth 

8. 
Export-led growth. Rea l g row th per annum reached 6.0 percent in the 2000-2004 period, through 
a comb ina t ion o f good weather and good management o f the co t ton sector, w h i c h continues t o p rov ide 
around two- th irds o f export earnings. Government has become a m i n o r i t y shareholder and silent partner 
in co t ton sector management, while the ginning marke t has been opened to t w o new operators in the East 
and Cen tra l Zones. A p r ic ing mechanism has been used to transfer w o r l d ma rke t signals to producers 
wh i le at the same time reduc ing vo la t i l i ty and risk fo r farmers. Produc t ion has increased by mo re than 8 
percent per annum in the 1998-2003 period, reach ing 550,000 me tr ic tons in 2004. L ives tock remained 
an impor tan t export for Bu rk ina within the region, as well. As a consequence, pove r ty reduc t ion was 
mos t pronounced in cotton-producing zones, w h i c h also experienced increased cereal produc t ion . L e s s 
progress has been made in d ive rs i fy ing i n t o other h igh-va lue expor t crops, a key to sustaining and 
accelerating g row th in the long-run . Mining offers another source o f long-run, expor t- led grow th . In the 
past five years, Government rev ised the lega l and regu la tory framework f o r p r iva te investment in the 
mining sector, wh i le imp rov ing the p roduc t iv i ty and safety o f artisanal mining. T w o foreign-domestic 
partnerships have invested in large-scale g o l d mining, with p roduc t ion expected to beg in later in 2005. 
With me ta l prices high, a number o f other investments are also under negotiation. 

9. 
Liberalization and privatization. Be tween 1998 and 2003, Governmen t dismantled non - ta r i f f 
barriers and reduced tariff p ro tec t ion in accordance with the WAEMU common customs un ion . In the 
ru ra l sector, IDA increasingly supported p r iva te actors and pub l ic-pr iva te partnerships fo r the de l ivery o f 
agr icu l tura l services. P r iva t iza t ion o f 4 1 state-owned enterprises has been completed, with another 2 1 
underway. Government has adopted strategies fo r p r iva te sector pa r t ic ipa t ion in the e lec tr ic i ty and 
pe tro leum sectors, and recen t ly approved a regu la tory framework that w i l l establish an independent 
regu la tory agency and promo te p r iva te entrants in to e lec tr ic i ty and pe t ro leum markets. Deregu la t ion o f 
the o i l and gas d is t r ibu t ion ma rke t has a l lowed the e n t r y o f n ew operators, the expansion o f the marke t to

r u r a l areas and imp roved service qua l i ty . L ibe ra l iza t ion o f the ce l lu lar telephone marke t has had perhaps 
the mos t v is ib le results, w i t h tw o new entrants driving pr ices down and expanding markets in to ru ra l 
areas. The successful establishment o f ARTEL, the telecoms regu la tory agency, i s serving as a mode l for 
other sectors, and transfer o f a ma jo r i ty share o f the na t iona l telecommunications agency to p r iva te 
investors i s expected in early 2006. 

10. 
Economic infrastructure. 
In 2000, Government adopted a transport sector strategy t o 
systematically upgrade and ma in ta in the p r i o r i t y road ne two rk and expand ru ra l feeder roads. T o date, 
1,120 km have been upgraded o r maintained. The transport sector program has also fac i l i ta ted the 
invo lvemen t o f sma l l- and med ium enterprises (SMEs) in road rehab i l i ta t ion and maintenance. After the 
collapse o f Air Afi-ique in 2000, Government negotiated open-sky agreements and licenses with ha l f a 
dozen a ir l ines -- in add i t ion to the four carriers already serving Bu rkma -- to avo id d isrup t ion and p rov ide 
greater oppor tun i t ies fo r passenger t ra f f ic and perishable exports. Government has also pursued a strategy 
to lowe r e lec t r ic i ty costs in the med ium- term (currently around 22 cents per kwh) by adop t ing least-cost 
system expansion options, and re ly ing o n increased impo r ts through the West A f r i c a Power Pool. 
Upcom ing i n v e s tm e n t s in the Cote-d’Ivoire-Ouagadougou transmission l i n e are an impor tan t e lemen t o f 
this strategy. 

11. 
Investment climate. In add i t ion to the above areas o f reform, the Burk inabb authorities have 
taken measures to imp rove the general environment fo r do ing business, harmon iz ing and reduc ing 
customs duties and corporate taxation, establishing an enterprise p romo t ion agency (Ma ison ,de 
1 ’Entreprise), ha rmon iz ing business l a w within the O H A D A fi-amework, creating a permanent pub l ic - 
p r iva te sector d ia logue and establishing separate commerc ia l chambers within the courts. A workshop 
held in February 2005 rev iewed data o n D o i n g Bus iness in Bu rk ina and underscored the scope for 
add i t iona l improvemen ts in the investment ~ l i m a t e . ~ Government has made a strong comm i tmen t to 
m o v i n g faster and farther in this area in com ing years, and the Bank’s coun try assistance strategy w i l l 
seek to p rov ide greater analytic and f inanc ia l support fo r these essential reforms. 

P i l la r Two: Guaranteeing Access of the Poor to Basic Social Services 

12. 
Basic education. 
Progress since 2000 in expanding access to basic education has been 
encouraging, a lbe i t insu f f ic ien t to achieve MDG targets. Government adopted the ten-year Basic 
Educa t ion Deve lopmen t Strategy (PDDEB) in 2000, garnering w ide support f r om the donor commun i ty 
for implementation. Use o f a ro l l ing , medium-term expenditure framework was in troduced fo r p lann ing 
and donor alignment, and a decision was taken to focus Government‘donor 
in terven t ion in the 20 
provinces with lowes t p r ima ry enro l lmen t rates. A na t iona l p rog ram was adopted to accelerate girls’ 
education, and pub l ic-pr iva te partnerships to expand secondary education were p i lo ted and rep l ica ted 
based o n early successes. The resu l t has been acceleration o f improvemen ts in gross in take rates, 
enro l lmen t rates and comp le t ion rates at the p r ima ry leve l , and expanded enro l lmen t at the secondary 
leve l , as we l l . The gap between boys and girls enro l lmen t has narrowed modestly, a l though the gross 
p r ima ry enro l lmen t rate in 2004 (52 percent) remains w e l l be low the Sub-Saharan average. In addition, 
the gap between the 20 focus provinces and the rest o f the coun try has w idened -- re f lec t ing perhaps 
differential economic g row th o r less e f f ic ien t spending. Ra is ing t h e e f f ic iency o f education spending i s o f 
highest p r i o r i t y in com ing years. 

13. 
Hea lth and nutrition. A ten-year Na t iona l Hea l th Deve lopmen t Strategy was adopted in 200 1. 
A Hea l th Sector M o n i t o r i n g Comm i t tee i n v o l v i n g c i v i l society and external partners was established in

2003 t o assess progress in implementation o f the strategy. Preventive services and a f fordab le care have 
improved , with free access to vaccinations and prenatal care, and lower-pr iced essential drugs. This 
strategy has con tr ibu ted to improved immun iza t ion coverage and increased u t i l iza t ion o f prenatal services 
and p r ima ry care fac i l i t ies . A poo led funding mechanism has been developed to channel resources 
d i rec t ly to hea l th d is tr ic ts on the basis o f mon i torab le ac t ion plans, and this approach w i l l be extended to 
hospitals in 2005. A f i r s t medium-term expenditure framework i s be ing prepared a long with a human 
resources ac t ion p l a n to alleviate severe s ta f f ing constraints, par t icu lar ly in ru ra l areas. Government’s 
strategy, coup led with sustained economic growth, has con tr ibu ted to improvements in hea l th status since 
2000, f o l l ow i n g a decade o f stagnation. In fan t and c h i l d mo r ta l i ty rates have fallen, wh i le the share o f 
assisted births has risen. However, nu t r i t iona l status has seemingly n o t improved, with 38 percent o f 
ch i ld ren considered underweight and chron ica l ly malnourished. Ma la r ia -- the greatest cause o f 
ch i ldhood mo r ta l i ty -- remains inadequately addressed and under-funded. 
14. 
HIWAIDS. A Na t iona l A I D S Counc i l , chaired by the President, and a na t iona l strategy were 
established in 2001. The country has since s ign i f ican t ly scaled up HIV/AIDS preven t ion and care 
activities, inc lud ing supporting m icro-pro jec ts in more than 3,500 villages, ac t ion plans in 22 m i n i s t r i e s 
and care and support ac t iv i t ies o f more than a thousand non-governmental and community-based 
organizations. Recent data indicate that HIV/AIDS prevalence among young women attending antenatal 
c l in ics has fallen, and condom use by men has increased. M o r e than 2,500 ind iv idua ls are n o w 
pa r t ic ipa t ing in the na t iona l ARV treatment program, imp rov ing the qua l i ty o f l i f e fo r these ind iv idua ls 
and the ir ch i ldren . 

15. 
Water supply and sanitation. Bu rk ina has made considerable progress in imp lemen t ing i ts 1998 
Na t iona l Water Po l icy and Strategy. In 2000, the popu la t ion o f Ouagadougou was g row ing by nea r ly 5 
percent per annum and had begun experiencing severe water shortages. Only about 30 percent o f 
households in Ouagadougou had connections-half 
the ra te o f some cap i ta l c i t ies in Sub-Saharan A f r ica . 
The na t iona l water and sanitation utility (ONEA ) had limited scope o f in terven t ion and poo r p roduc t iv i ty . 
Multiple external partners have supported Government in re fo rm o f ONEA, increased expansion o f 
Ouagadougou’s water supply, and to a lesse r extent pr iva te sector par t ic ipa t ion in the sector. As a resu l t , 
be tween 2001 and 2004, the number o f active connections in Ouagadougou rose by 20 percent and the 
popu la t ion served by near ly 40 percent. F inanc ia l sustainability o f ONEA and the urban water sector has 
also imp roved s ign i f ican t ly . However, the s i tua t ion in other urban centers served by ONEA remains 
difficult. Deeper re forms are needed to promo te p r iva te pa r t ic ipa t ion in urban water supply to increase 
e f f ic iency , imp rove t a r i f f po l icy and reinvest revenues t o better s e r v e customers. Beyond urban centers, 
surveys ind ica te anywhere f r om 35 to 50 percent access t o po tab le water in r u r a l areas, pa r t icu la r ly 
th rough commun i ty stand pipes. However, qua l i ty and re l iab i l i ty o f water services rema in poo r in sem i - 
urban and ru ra l areas, w i t h sanitation services lagg ing fur ther behind -- and v i r tua l ly nonexistent in ru ra l 
areas. 

P i l la r Three: Expanding Employment and Income Opportunities Among the Poor 

16. 
Employment and vocational training. Progress has been sporadic in this doma in re f lec t ing the 
need fo r an updated and shared strategy that i s better l i n k e d t o the g row th and pove r ty reduc t ion agenda. 
Measures to date have supported targeted Government programs rather than enhancing the ove ra l l 
env ironmen t fo r j o b creation. Professional t ra in ing centers have been rehab i l i ta ted and the number o f 
students increased. Government has launched na t iona l funds fo r SME and micro-enterprise development, 
and has strengthened support services for bo th . Rev is ions were made to existing labor laws to enhance 
labor marke t f lex ib i l i ty , although add i t iona l progress i s needed. An emp loymen t observatory was 
established to strengthen na t iona l capacity t o mon i to r emp loymen t trends and better understand links t o 
g row th and pove r ty reduction. Upda t ing o f the 1998 Emp loymen t Strategy w i l l be undertaken in 2005 
and 2006, with an a im to favo r ing j o b crea t ion over pos t p ro tec t ion within a more f lex ib le labor market. 

- 5 - 

Agriculture and rura l revenues. Government has put the accent o n technological solutions -- 
17. 
f r om simple to highly sophisticated-to 
reduce agricultural risk, increase produc t ion and promote 
d ivers i f ica t ion . E f fo r ts have ranged f rom ra in fa l l management to in t roduc ing gene t ica l ly-mod i f ied seeds 
to encouraging v i l lage composting and community-based investment in treadle pumps and other adapted 
technologies fo r small-scale irr iga t ion . These have helped agr icu l tura l p roduc t ion dnve g row th and 
reduce pover ty since 2000. Co t ton produc t ion doubled, along with increased food crop production. 
Farmers’ associations (of wh ich nearly ha l f were among women) demonstrated the substantial po ten t ia l 
fo r i r r iga ted dry-season produc t ion to raise and stabilize ru ra l household incomes. Government also put 
in p lace a m icro-cred i t fund to support small-scale livestock, ago-process ing and marke t ing activities, as 
w e l l as a fund channeled through women’s centers to increase women’s access to appropriate technology 
and transport in 20 o f the poorest provinces. 

18. 
Community-driven development. M a j o r s tr ides have been made in m o v i n g beyond trad i t iona l 
state-provided services for ru ra l development. Through i t s Na t iona l Program fo r L a n d Management 
(PNGT2) and s im i lar donor-funded in i t ia t ives , government has embraced commun i ty-dr iven development 
and v i l lage empowerment to p l a n and imp lemen t loca l development programs and pro tec t the 
environment. Thousands o f loca l i t ies have established and tra ined gender-balanced v i l lage committees 
that have wo rked t o increase agr icu l tura l p roduc t iv i ty through anti-erosion projects, water management 
and re- in troduc t ion o f trad i t iona l so i l fe r t i l iza t ion techn iques , as w e l l as a range o f social service projects. 
Sca l ing up commun i ty d r iven development -- and harmon iz ing donor-dr iven approaches around a 
na t iona l mode l -- are key p r io r i t ies fo r the fu ture . 
19. 
Ru ra l infrastructure. The transport sector strategy has iden t i f ied 12,000 km o f r u r a l feeder roads 
to be constructed o r upgraded, o f w h i c h about 3,000 lun are under IDA f inanc ing . Ag r icu l tu ra l marke t ing 
infrastructure has also been a p r io r i ty . Recently, a fruit and vegetable expor t fac i l i ty was opened in Bobo- 
D iou lasso (with support from IDA) to help exporters mee t qua l i ty and packag ing standards fo r g loba l 
markets. In l i n e with the country’s e lec tr i f ica t ion strategy, government has focused f i r s t o n secondary 
u rban centers that p l a y a key ro le in linking ru ra l zones to markets and soc ia l services. At the same time, 
125 departmental centers in ru ra l areas are par t ic ipa t ing in a renewable energy p i l o t to in troduce solar 
panels fo r p r i o r i t y mun ic ipa l buildings, social services and pub l ic lighting. Expans ion o f the na t iona l 
e lec t r ic i ty grid i s n o t a cost-effective op t ion fo r much o f ru ra l Bu rk ina -- putting a premium on 
development o f alternative and renewable energy sources. 

P i l lar Four: Promoting Good Governance 

20. 
Democratic institutions. Since tak ing powe r in a coup in 1987, the current regime has gradually 
in troduced democratic reforms, a l though po l i t ica l con t ro l remains firmly in the hands o f the ruling party. 
A na t iona l reconc i l ia t ion process, inc lud ing compensation fo r v ic t ims o f ear l ier po l i t ica l violence, has 
a imed t o enhance unity and build shared v is ion . Nonetheless, the shadow o f past violence continues t o 
ma rk the na t iona l consciousness. A l leged interference in the po l i t ica l a f fa irs o f other countries -- 
pa r t icu la r ly in the early years o f the reg ime -- has also underm ined i t s repu ta t ion in in terna t iona l circles. 
Bu rk ina n o w ho lds mu l t i -pa r ty elections at the executive, leg is la t ive and mun ic ipa l levels, and 
Government maintains a permanent dialogue with oppos i t ion parties through the Na t iona l Assembly. The 
coun try adopted a Na t iona l Strategy o n Good Governance in 1998 w h i c h i s n o w be ing updated, and 
established a Na t iona l Coord ina t ion Unit o n Good Governance in 2002 fo r cross-cutting decision-making. 
A rev ised Code on In fo rma t ion has created a mo re favorable environment f o r a free press , a l though s e l f - 
censorship and weak capacity rema in the ru le rather than the exception. C iv i l society groups have 
mob i l ized increasingly f o l l ow i n g a Na t iona l F o r um o n C i v i l Society in la te 2002 and an independent 
rev iew o f the revised CSLP in 2003. Building greater t r u s t be tween government and c i v i l society groups, 
and enhancing public access to in forma t ion , rema in areas fo r further progress. 

- 6 - 

21. 
Judicial reform and anti-corruption. A Na t iona l A c t i o n P lan to Re fo rm the Jud ic ia l System was 
adopted in 2000 with the a im o f increasing the independence o f the jud ic ia ry and bringing i t closer to the 
people. Organ iza t iona l and statutory reforms have been implemented to increase the independence o f 
magistrates, create better checks and balances within the Supreme Cour t system and bring leg is la t ion i n t o 
a l ignmen t with in terna t iona l standards. Desp i te some progress, corrup t ion and ine f f ic iency are perceived 
to be persistent prob lems o f the jud ic iary , and lowe r courts are hampered by weak capacity and 
insu f f ic ien t decentralization, wh ich continue to undermine access to jus t ice . M o r e broadly, corrup t ion i s 
perce ived as a moderate, but growing, p rob lem in Bu rhna , w h i c h must be combated with a v is ib le and 
unambiguous response f rom government. T h e coun try established a High Au tho r i ty to Combat 
Co r rup t ion in 2002, and this was accompanied by development o f a Na t iona l An t i -co r rup t ion N e tw o r k 
among c i v i l soc ie ty organizations. M o r e Government ac t ion i s n o w needed to raise the cost o f co r rup t ion 
and increase the l ike l ihood o f exposure and sanctions. 

22. 
Economic governance. Substantial progress has been made with respect to pub l ic resource 
management, pa r t icu la r ly through budgetary re form . The government’s Program to Strengthen Budget 
Management (PRGB) was adopted in 2002. 
Imp lemen ta t ion progress has included: a) adop t ion o f the 
leg is la t ive f ramewo rk fo r budget deconcentration; b) i n i t i a l deconcentration o f payment orders; 
c) in t roduc t ion o f p rog ram budgeting and med ium- term expenditure frameworks as standard budgeting 
tools; d) establishment o f the Supreme Audit Ins t i tu t ion (Cow des Comptes) fo r budgetary oversight; 
e) submission o f annual budget execution reports to the Supreme Audit Ins t i tu t ion ; f ) r e f o m o f pub l ic 
procurement p o l i c y to enhance transparency; g) agreement among donors o n a common framework fo r 
p rov id ing and mon i to r ing budget support; and h) increased budget allocations and imp roved budget 
execution fo r p r i o r i t y sectors, inc lud ing health, H I V / A I D S , basic education and r u r a l development. 
Con t inued progress in imp lemen t ing the PRGB, coup led with imp roved linkages between strategic 
p lann ing and pub l ic resource management, w i l l be needed t o imp rove the effectiveness o f government’s 
e f for ts to reduce pover ty .

Administrative reform and decentralization. A na t iona l p lan fo r the Comprehensive Re fo rm o f 
Pub l ic Adm in is t ra t ion was adopted in 1998, a l though imp lemen ta t ion has been limited in scope. Progress 
has inc luded some deconcentration o f human resources management to l i n e ministries, adop t ion o f more 
f lex ib le con trac t ing regulations, in troduc t ion o f a merit-based eva lua t ion system fo r c i v i l servants and 
gradual extension o f an integrated administrative and p a y r o l l in fo rma t ion system (SIGASPE). In the la te 
199Os, government also adopted a p o l i c y or ien ta t ion towa rd decentralization and deconcentration. Since 
then, basic education and hea l th m i n i s t r i e s have made some progress within the constraints o f ex is t ing 
law . However, as in many countries, imp lemen ta t ion has faced po l i t ica l resistance and ingra ined 
disincentives fo r c i v i l servants. A step fo rwa rd was taken with the appointment o f 13 reg iona l governors 
in 2004. At end-2004, the po l i t ica l ly controversial and long-awa i ted L a w o n L o c a l Adm in is t ra t ion was 
passed, p rov id ing a clear framework fo r decentralization tha t includes establishment o f ru ra l communes in 
2005 with loca l ly elected governments. The success o f decentralization w i l l depend o n h o w w e l l 
Government overcomes rema in ing po l i t ica l resistance and defines and sequences measures to transfer

produc t ion . Excep t iona l ra in fa l l in 2003 made i t a banner year fo r agr icu l tura l production, with effects o n 
expo r t earnings and domestic demand that carr ied in to 2004, buoy ing rea l g row th in industry and services 
to above 6 percent. This muted the immediate impac t o f shocks ar is ing in the latter h a l f o f 2004, including 
reg iona l locus t in fes ta t ion (wh ich reduced l ives tock export earnings by around 30 percent), renewed 
ins tab i l i ty in ne ighbo r ing C6te d’Ivoire, a 30 percent f a l l in w o r l d co t ton prices, a 3 1 percent increase in 
w o r l d pe tro leum pr ices and nom ina l exchange rate appreciation o f around seven percent. As a r e s u l t o f 
these mu l t ip le shocks, value-added f r om the agr icu l tura l sector stagnated in 2004, and GD P g row th f e l l to 
4.8 percent, w e l l be low the 6.0 percent targeted in the CSLP. G row th prospects fo r 2005 are further 
constrained, with pro jec ted rea l GDP g row th expected to reach about 3.5 percent. 

25. 
L o o k i n g ahead, the base case macroeconomic scenario fo r Bu rk ina rests o n current pro jec t ions o f 
in terna t iona l co t ton prices rising modestly f r om US$0.56 per pound to US$0.60 per pound in 2009, a long 
with exchange ra te stability. Co t ton export earnings are expected to increase by around fou r percent per 
annum in rea l te rms , with moderate g row th o f non-co t ton export earnings as we l l . O n the impo r t side, the 
base case assumes moderate softening o f o i l prices in l ine with current w o r l d projections. Assuming n o 
fur ther de ter iora t ion in sub-regional stability, sustained a id f lows and continued macro-economic 
s tab i l i ty , rea l GD P g row th i s expected to average around 4.8 percent per annum in the 2005-2009 period. 

26. 
A more op t im is t ic scenario assumes more rap id g row th o f export earnings, e i the r through 
imp roved co t ton prospects o r faster g row th o f non-co t ton exports such as m i n i n g and hor t icu l ture . This 
w o u l d likely requ ire higher p r iva te investment and increased a id f lows . Rea l GDP g row th might r i s e to as 
m u c h as 6.0 percent per annum i f such favorable conditions preva i l . G r ow t h beyond this i s considered

28. 
External accounts. Burk ina ’s terms o f trade declined by a cumu la t ive 20 percent in 2001-2004, 
and are expected t o decline by a further five percent in 2005. Prudent f isca l and mone tary po l icy (within 
the C F A F mone tary union) has held in f la t ion to less than 3 percent per annum since 2000, m i t iga t ing the 
impac t o f nom ina l currency appreciation o n the rea l effective exchange rate. Despite increased vo lume o f 
co t ton exports, dec l in ing t e rm s o f trade have kept the current account de f ic i t (exc lud ing grants) high, at 
around 11-12 percent o f GDP . T o finance this gap, Bu rk ina w i l l con t inue to rely o n fore ign financing, 
inc lud ing a id disbursements and debt r e l i e f . 

Debt sustainabiZity. 

29. 
As an early entrant in to the Highly Indeb ted Poor Countries (HIPC) 
in i t ia t ive , Bu rk ina received debt r e l i e f under b o t h the o r ig ina l and the enhanced HIPC In i t ia t ive in the 
amount o f US$424 m i l l i o n in end-1999 N e t Present Va lue (NPV) terms. In addition, Bu rk ina also 
qua l i f ied fo r a topping-up assistance o f US$129 m i l l i o n in end-2001 NPV terms. T h e to ta l r e l i e f 
p rov ided reduced the NPV o f Bu rk ina ’s outstanding debt by near ly 50 percent at the Comp le t ion Point.

Since then, changes in in terna t iona l interest rates and the depreciation o f the U S $ have weakened 
Burk ina ’s debt ou t look . These adverse factors were on ly pa r t ia l ly o f fse t by mo re favorable than

Bu rk ina ’s prospects fo r debt sustainability con t inue to h inge o n the strength o f i t s exports 
eamings and o n the terms o f i t s n ew borrow ing . As an i l lus tra t ion , Figure 1 above shows the evo lu t ion o f 
debt sustainability based o n d i f fe ren t scenarios o f exports performance. The current DSA i s consistent 
with the base case macroeconomic scenario and assumes nom ina l g row th o f export eamings o f seven 
percent per annum in the 2006-2009 period. However, i f g row th o f nom ina l export eamings fa l ls 
s ign i f ican t ly short o f this (as seen in the s e n s i t i v i t y analysis), Bu rk ina w i l l be debt distressed fo r some 
t ime to come. In either scenario, substantial and highly concessional f inanc ing -- inc lud ing f r om IDA -- 
w i l l be needed fo r the foreseeable fu tu re to ensure debt sus ta inab i l i ty w h i l e accelerating g row th and 
progress towards the MDGs. A j o i n t IMFNVB m iss ion w i l l conduct an update o f the DSA in June 2005 
using the n ew fkamework fo r assessing debt sustainability o f l o w income countries wh ich was adopted by 
the Bank and Fund Boards in M a r c h 2005. 

32. 
Fiscal revenues. Government revenues (exc lud ing grants) have r isen f rom an average o f 11.4 
percent o f GD P in 2000-2002 t o an average o f 12.4 percent o f GDP in mo re recent years. This modest 
increase re f lec ts imp roved tax administration, o n the one hand, coup led with reduced customs and 
corporate rates t o stimulate investment, o n the other. N om i n a l revenues have increased by about 33 
percent since 2002, compared to on ly 15 percent fo r to ta l expenditures and n e t lending. In 2005, revenues 
are pro jec ted to r i s e to 13.2 percent o f GDP, a f i g u r e that has been rev ised downwa rd to take in to account 
the expected s lowdown in economic ac t iv i ty . D e s p i t e progress, this ra te fa l ls be low the average fo r Sub- 
Saharan A f r i c a and the norms established within WAEMU (targeted at 17 percent o f GDP). In future, 
efforts w i l l focus o n broaden ing the tax base, pa r t icu la r ly as f i r m s shift in to the fo rma l sector. 

33 . 
Expenditure management. Throughou t the 200 1-2004 period, the budget has been executed 
b road ly in l ine with CSLP objectives and the f inanc ia l p rog ram agreed with the IMF. Nea r ly h a l f o f a l l 
pub l ic expenditures have been financed through ex tema l f lows , increas ing ly p rov ided as d irec t budge t 
support o r programma t ic funds. D isc ip l ined management has kep t the basic balance (revenue exc lud ing 

- 1 0 - 

grants minus expenditure exc lud ing foreign-financed cap i ta l spending) at around 3 percent o f GDP 
despite shocks t o t h e economy and unexpected expenditures. At the same time, spending in p r i o r i t y 
sectors -- pa r t icu la r ly health, HIV/AIDS, education and ru ra l development has been increased as agreed, 
with add i t iona l support f rom HLPC resources. Poverty-reducing social expenditures increased f r om 4.8 
percent o f GDP in 2002 to 5 . 8 percent in 2004. Prospects fo r the CAS pe r iod inc lude gradual 
improvemen t in revenue generation to around 15.2 percent o f GDP, coupled with con t inued high levels o f 
ex tema l assistance (assuming continued coun try performance), and expenditure management in l i n e with 
resource ava i lab i l i ty . 

C. Challenges Ahead 

34. 

Given the coun try context, recent progress and medium-term prospects, the m a i n challenges fo r 
Bu rk ina in the upcom ing C A S pe r iod can be summarized as fo l lows : 

Ma in ta in ing commitment to reform despite 

less favorable conditions for growth. 

F l e x i b i l i t y w i l l be needed to address uncertainty about the evo lu t ion o f the w o r l d co t ton 
market, and deeper sectoral adjustment w i l l be needed fo r wha t may p rove t o be a long- term 
trend. Reforms and targeted investment w i l l be needed to fur ther imp rove competitiveness in 
the co t ton sector, as the coun try pursues long - run ‘d ivers i f ica t ion . On-go ing locus t invasions 
in the sub-region w i l l also pose a threat to agr icu l tura l produc t ion . In the short-term, sub- 
reg iona l ins tab i l i ty w i l l continue to complicate the challenge o f reg iona l integration, with i t s 
prom ise o f bigger markets and expanded t ra in ing and employment opportunities. Bu rk ina 
w i l l also need to fully engage at the in terna t iona l leve l to in f luence g loba l po l ic ies o n trade, 
debt and aid. Frag i le debt sustainability w i l l be at risk i f g row th falters in the short-run. 

Overcoming long-standing obstacles to economic diversification. With a l e s s favorable 

environment fo r growth, the need t o reduce risk and multiply sources o f income in Bu rk ina ’s 
mono-crop economy becomes more evident. Govemmen t w i l l n e e d t o address structural 
impediments-like 
the high cost o f energy-and 
unleash the po ten t ia l o f p r iva te 
en trepreneurs to identify opportunities and take r i s k s . The coun try w i l l need to make op t ima l 
use o f i t s limited resource base, through water management to develop dry season agr icu l tura l 
exports, sustainable land management fo r increased produc t iv i ty , supportive po l ic ies to build 
capacity and develop agr icu l tura l supply chains, development o f large-scale and artisanal 
mining, and pos i t ion ing o f Bu rk ina as a reg iona l hub fo r transport and services. 

Improv ing the efficiency of pub l ic spending for social services, water and sanitation. 

Burk ina ’s long-run track reco rd o n building human capital i s disappointing, and i s re f lec ted 
in the country’s rank near the bo t tom o f the Human Deve lopmen t Index . Na t iona l trends fo r 
health, education, water supply and sanitation have been encouraging in recent years, but the 
accumulated “social de f ic i t ” i s huge, and serves to perpetuate pove r ty and hamper Burk ina ’s 
ab i l i ty to compete in reg iona l and g loba l markets. To ca tch up with A f r i c a and the wor ld , 
government must dep loy scarce resources mo re strategically, d raw ing o n partnerships with 
the pr iva te sector, c i v i l society organizations and communities. M o r e e f f ic ien t social 
spending w i l l require, inter a l ia , imp roved expenditure tracking, strengthened m in is te r ia l 
capacity, decentralized administration, empowered communities, and s imp le results-oriented 
mon i tor ing . 

Decentralizing development to enhance pro-poor growth. Recent g row th has been good fo r 

the poo r in Bu rk ina -- b u t ensuring that g r ow t h translates i n t o imp roved we l l -be ing fo r t h e 
ru ra l poor i s o f highest p r io r i ty . Linking r u r a l commun i t ies to economic and social service 
centers w i l l be key to their greater pa r t ic ipa t ion in grow th . Crea t ing e f fec t ive rura l-urban 

- 11 - 

l inkages w i l l requ ire decentralized urban development. Transport and marke t infrastructure, 
telecommunications and affordable energy must be matched by imp roved land and water 
management and by greater pr iva te sector investment in agr icu l tura l supply chains and 
processing technology. Decentralized decision-making by empowered communities w i l l be 
needed t o imp rove the cost-effectiveness o f social and mun ic ipa l service delivery, and a l low 
loca l popu la t ions to better exp lo i t economic opportunities. M o r e inc lus ive po l ic ies -- 
pa r t icu la r ly fo r women -- wou ld improve access to land, appropriate technology and other 
inputs fo r crop and l ives tock development. 

Creating a public sector interface that inspires private sector confidence. The “stroke o f the 

pen” re fo rms that characterized early economic l ibe ra l iza t ion are largely completed in 
Bu rk ina . The task i s n o w harder, requ i r ing a trans forma t ion o f the central s ta te apparatus to 
support private-sector l e d g row th and decentralized social service de l ivery . Sector-specific 
r e f o rm must be supported by cross-cutting changes in p lann ing and budge t ing processes, 
pub l ic expenditure management, c i v i l service deconcentration and remuneration, pub l ic 
procurement and mon i to r ing and evaluation systems. The governance requirements fo r do ing 
business and creating wea l th in B u r h n a are the same as elsewhere: stable economic and 
fiscal policies, e f f ic ien t pub l ic administration, 
transparent pub l ic procurement, clear 
ownership rights, t ime ly and uncormp t jud ic ia l decisions, adequate contract enforcement, 
re l iab le u t i l i t ies and technology, and a leve l p lay ing field fo r investors. Harnessing the 
po l i t ica l w i l l and administrative capacity to make s ign i f ican t progress in these areas w i l l be 
one o f Bu rk ina ’s greatest challenges. 

111. WORLD BANK GROUP PARTNERSHIP WITH BURKINA FASO 

A. Lessons from the Previous Country Assistance Strategy 

35 . 
The coun try p rog ram identified in the 2000 C A S and 2003 C A S Progress Repor t was fully 
implemented. A C A S Comp le t ion Repor t (CASCR, see Annex 7) prov ides an assessment o f the 
relevance and effectiveness o f this coun try program. Overall, development outcomes in the pe r iod under 
rev iew (FY00-04) were satisfactory, as were Bank and Burk inabb performance in implementing the 
strategy. Va r iab i l i ty in outcomes and performance by sector and theme are documented in the CASCR . 
M o r e generally, cross-cutting lessons emerged f r om imp lemen ta t ion o f the las t CAS that are n o w be ing 
taken in to account in designing the FY06-09 strategy. These inc lude : 

Sustained commitment to sound policies creates the basis for accelerated growth. With 

consistent leadership and strong coun try ownership, Bu rk ina has pursued market-oriented re forms 
fo r more than a decade. Desp i te i t s many resource and capac i ty constraints, sound po l ic ies and 
good economic management have a l lowed Bu rk ina to sustain g row th o f over five percent pe r 
annum fo r the past decade. The coun try i s b road ly o n track -- and deserves in terna t iona l support 
to fine-tune strategy and accelerate pos i t ive trends t o reduce pove r ty and imp rove social welfare. 

Diversification and decentralization are key to more inclusive growth. Growth in recent years 

has benefited the poor, pa r t icu la r ly in cotton-producing areas. The upcom ing C A S w i l l support 
development a imed at reach ing i n t o r u r a l areas, a l low ing r u r a l popu la t ions to participate more 
fully in g row th and access essential social services. The “double Ds” h o l d the key to pro-poor 
growth, by increasing economic oppor tun i t ies fo r r u r a l households and empower ing communities 
to manage mun ic ipa l and social services. 

- 1 2 - 

0 Strengthening capacity and country systems w i l l enhance results and sustainability. As the 
coun try moves in to a second-generation PRSP and deepening reforms, weak capacity and coun try 
systems rema in a stumbling b lock . Limited capacity in decentralized hea l th fac i l i t ies and 
ine f f ic ien t pub l ic procurement procedures are j u s t two o f many examples. A l o n g with other 
ex terna l partners, IDA needs to use i t s upcom ing C A S to strengthen capacity and coun try systems 
needed to manage the development process. 

Progress on simplification and harmonization has lagged behind rhetoric. Use o f the PRSC 
instrument to support implementation o f the pove r ty reduc t ion strategy -- and harmon iza t ion o f 
budge t support among donors -- has been a ma jo r benefit fo r the c l ien t . At the sector level, 
however, progress has been disappointing in terms o f IDA’s own e f for ts as w e l l as that o f other 
partners. During the upcom ing C A S period, task leaders w i l l be g iven greater incentives to adopt 
programma t ic approaches based o n agreed sector strategies and expenditure frameworks, j o i n t 
missions, poo led resources, common procedures, and un i f ied mon i to r ing systems. Progress o n 
IDA’s s imp l i f ica t ion and harmon iza t ion w i l l be measured in the CAS .

A stronger focus on results. The results-based me thodo logy w h i c h guided CAS

An increasingly programmatic approach. Transaction costs o f outmoded p ro jec t 
approaches are c r ipp l ing Bu rk ina ’s adm in is tra t ion in a number o f areas. IDA has found 
programma t ic support t o be effective, but can go further in app ly ing the Bank ’s 
funds 
s imp l i f ied coun try 
f inanc ing parametersg, channeling 
through 
the PRSC 
mechanism and supporting sector strategies with poo led SWAPS, harmonized procedures 
and common reporting. Targeted investment operations w i l l be jus t i f ied in some 
instances, pa r t icu la r ly to p i l o t innova t ions through p r iva te sector channels. 

Enhanced support for country systems and capacity. M o r e than ever, the C A S w i l l be 
seen as a too l to strengthen coun try systems and build capacity to manage fo r 
development results. Sector operations w i l l support development o f coun try management 
and mon i to r ing systems, with cross-cutting operations and analytic w o r k a imed at 
strengthening pub l ic administration, statistical systems and decentralized management. 

C . Strategic Objectives

The rev ised CSLP prov ides the framework in w h i c h the FY06 -09 C A S can con tr ibu te to Bu rk ina 
Faso’s development objectives. Par t ic ipa tory development o f the CSLP served as strong founda t ion o n

outcomes: a) increased reg iona l integration; b) expanded and d ivers i f ied export earnings; c) an imp roved 
inves tmen t climate; and d) more e f f ic ien t economic infrastructure. IDA w i l l w o r k c lose ly with I F C and 
MIGA within the Bank Group to p rov ide a comprehensive service in support o f p r iva te sector growth." 

1.a. Increased Regional Integration 

39. 
As a land locked coun try of less than 13 m i l l i o n inhabitants, Bu rk ina has a long - te rm economic 
interest in reg iona l integration, and serves as host coun try fo r the headquarters o f the Wes t A f r ican 
Econom ic and Mone ta ry U n i o n (WEAMU). A coun try the size o f Bu rk ina cannot s ign i f ican t ly expand 
and d ive rs i fy i t s produc t ion unless i t has access to a larger reg iona l market. Th rough PRSCs, IDA w i l l 
con t inue to support Bu rk ina in reach ing WEAMU macroeconomic convergence c r i te r ia and harmon iz ing 
trade and economic po l ic ies within the common West A h c a n framework. 
IDA w i l l also support 
investments fo r reg iona l integration, pa r t icu la r ly with respect to infrastructure, energy , f inanc ia l markets 
and agr icu l tura l p roduc t iv i ty . F o r infrastructure development, this includes on-go ing support fo r reg iona l 
co l labora t ion in c i v i l aviation, as w e l l as on-go ing p o l i c y dialogue o n reg iona l r a i l transport and 
telecommunications. Planned reg iona l operations that complement the ex is t ing p o r t f o l i o inc lude the 
Reg iona l Trans i t Fac i l i ta t ion Program and West A f r ican Power Poo l Program, b o t h scheduled fo r FY08 . 
In the f inanc ia l sector, modern iza t ion o f the reg iona l payment system i s be ing l e d by B C E A O with 
support f r om the W o r l d Bank . A rea l- t ime settlement system fo r large payments i s n o w operational, and 
an electronic clearing system fo r mass payments i s expected by end-2005. IDA i s also suppor t ing the 
West A h c a n Development Bank with a l i n e o f credit, guarantees and techn ica l support a imed at 
strengthening reg iona l cap i ta l markets. 
In terms o f agr icu l tura l produc t iv i ty , Bu rk ina i s already 
pa r t ic ipa t ing in the A f r ican Program to Combat Locus t In fes ta t ion f o l l ow i n g last year's crisis, and w i l l 
participate in the West A f r i c a Ag r icu l tu ra l P roduc t iv i ty Program (WAAPP) in i t ia ted by N E P A D with 
IDA support. 

I .b . Expanded and Diversified Export Earnings 

40. 
IDA w i l l contribute to enhancing Bu rk ina 's trade prospects within reg iona l and g loba l markets. 
An Integrated Trade Framework analysis in F Y 0 6 w i l l re in fo rce the ana ly t ic underp inn ing fo r second-

a l lev ia t ing constraints to marke t ing and ago-processing. Special emphasis w i l l be placed on women 
farmers’ access t o appropriate technology, inputs and markets. 

I.c. Improved Investment Climate 

41. 
IDA ’S on-go ing support for pr iva te sector development (Projet d’Appui h la Compdtitivitd et l e 
Dkveloppement des Entreprises, PACDE ) w i l l contribute to strengthening the Enterprise P romo t ion 
Agency, establishing a one-stop shop fo r investment formalities, speeding and en forc ing commerc ia l 
cour t decisions, and p rov id ing technical support fo r p r iva t iza t ion and p r iva te sector regulation. 
In 
addition, the p rog ram w i l l support access to credit fo r sma l l and med ium enterprises, in co l labora t ion with 
the IFC . In ear ly 2005, P A C D E supported analysis re la ted to D o i n g Bus iness in Burk ina , iden t i fy ing 
re forms needed to reduce the time and cost o f business reg is tra t ion and l iqu ida t ion , imp rove enforcement

sequenced in to the PRSC 6-9 se r ies a long with other recommended measures ar is ing f r om par t ic ipa tory 
analytic w o r k in this area. IDA w i l l support an Investment C l ima te Assessment and a F inanc ia l Sector 
Rev iew in F Y 0 6 t o assist government in further defining the med ium- term agenda. 

1.d. M o r e efficient Economic Infrastructure 

42. 
IDA w i l l continue to support p r iva t iza t ion and increased p r iva te sector par t ic ipa t ion in the 
e lec tr ic i ty , pe tro leum and telecommunications sectors through the P A C D E and PRSC instruments. 
Pr iva t iza t ion o f the telecommunications para-statal and imp lemen ta t ion o f the regu la tory framework in 
the power and pe tro leum sectors are immediate pr ior i t ies . The on-go ing po r t fo l io i s we l l-pos i t ioned to 
contribute to Burk ina ’s e f for ts t o increase re l iab i l i ty and reduce the costs o f e lec t r ic i ty and transport. The 
Power Sector Deve lopmen t Pro jec t (PSDP) jo ins with fou r other partners fo r urgently needed inves tmen ts 
in domestic powe r generation and cons truc t ion o f the transmission l i n e f r om C8 te d ’ Ivo i re through Bobo - 
Dioulasso to Ouagadougou. I t also supports the Government in strengthening the legal, regu la tory and 
ins t i tu t iona l framework f o r p r iva te investment and imp lemen ta t ion o f a least-cost energy access program. 
IDA ’S second operation in support o f Burk ina ’s Transport Sector Program (PST2) i s par t o f a b road

upgrad ing and maintenance o f the p r i o r i t y road ne two rk and to expanding r u r a l feeder roads. 

43. 
Econom ic and marke t in fras truc ture in secondary urban areas w i l l also be supported by IDA, such 
as the planned slaughter house in Bobo-Dioulasso a imed at increas ing l ives tock exports. WBI w i l l 
complement these e f for ts by he lp ing government iden t i fy op t ions fo r p r iva te par t ic ipa t ion in 
infrastructure and instruments fo r the m i t iga t ion o f r i s k s re la ted t o development o f infrastructure projects. 
At the sector level, WBI w i l l strengthen the capacity o f te lecommun ica t ion regulators to imp lemen t 
universal access p o l i c y and support imp lemen ta t ion o f the country’s MDG A c t i o n P lan for mun ic ipa l

Strategic Objective 2: Improved Access to Basic Social Services 

44. 
T o support progress toward Burk ina ’s human development goals, the C A S w i l l contribute to: 
a) imp roved access to, and qua l i ty of, basic education pa r t icu la r ly fo r girls and in underserved provinces; 
b) imp roved access to, and qua l i ty of, health, nu tr i t ion , and HIV/ATDS preven t ion and care services; 
c) increased access among the poo r to potable water and sanitation services; and d) a better targeted social 
p ro tec t ion strategy. 

2. a. Improved Access to, and Quality oJ Basic Education 

45. 
PRSP objectives inc lude expanding access to education services among the poor by increasing 
coverage o f basic education; imp rov ing the qua l i ty o f education; developing mo re e f fec t ive l i teracy 
programs fo r adults, especially women; and establishing a be t te r equilibrium within the education system 
tha t w o u l d respond in b o t h quan t i ty and qua l i ty t o the needs o f the economy. Th rough the on-go ing Basic 
Educa t ion Sector Program, IDA has jo ined with other donors in supporting Government in the 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the Ten-Year Plan fo r the Development of Basic Education (PDDEB). The BESP w i l l 
be restructured at mid-term, however, t o promote a more harmonized subsector-wide approach among 
donors, inc lud ing poo led funds and common procedures and repo r t ing requirements. Already, donor 
support -- inc lud ing IDA support -- aims to help Bu rk ina Faso better target inves tmen ts in education, 
pa r t icu la r ly to provinces with the lowes t enrollment rates and greater gender imbalances, through school 
cons truc t ion programs and pub l ic-pr iva te partnerships at the loca l leve l fo r mo re decentralized and 
e f f ic ien t school management. Qua l i ty enhancement i s being pursued through imp roved tex tbook 
ava i lab i l i ty , teacher in-service t ra in ing and increased rea l teaching and learning t ime -- as well as 
p romo t ing learn ing assessments fo r p r ima ry and secondary students through development o f standardized 
tes t ing and imp roved data co l lec t ion and analysis. 

46. 
A recently-closed ID A - f u n d e d Post-Primary Educa t ion Pro jec t supported an innova t ive pub l ic - 
p r iva te partnership (PPP) mode l fo r expansion o f secondary education w h i c h w i l l be rep l ica ted by 
Government, with likely support f r om other donors. Successful imp lemen ta t ion o f PDDEB w o u l d a l low 
IDA t o f o l l ow up with an Educa t ion SWAP towa rd the end o f the C A S period. In addition, IDA may be in 
a pos i t ion to support a commun i ty-dr iven development mechanism fo r social service de l ive ry by the end 
o f the C A S period, i f su f f ic ien t progress i s made in administrative deconcentration and decentralization. 

2.b. Improved access of the poor to health and H I V / A I D S services 

47. 
The broad health-related objectives o f the CSLP are t o reduce c h i l d and maternal mor ta l i ty , 
imp rove c h i l d nu tr i t ion , and reduce HIV prevalence. The C A S w i l l support na t iona l e f for ts to increase 
u s e and qua l i ty o f primary health services through system-wide re forms and greater emphasis o n 
vacc ina t ion coverage, prenatal care, assisted births, and contraceptive use. B a n k assistance w i l l also a im 
to enhance the coverage and effectiveness o f HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and treatment programs, in 
order t o reduce high-risk behavior, and imp rove access t o ARV treatment fo r A I D S patients. Since 
malaria i s the ma jor source o f c h i l d mo r ta l i ty and adu l t mo rb id i ty in Burk ina , B a n k support w i l l a im at 
scaling up ma lar ia preven t ion and treatment programs, inc lud ing s ign i f ican t ly expanding coverage o f 
treated bed-nets. F ina l ly , the B a n k w i l l seek t o strengthen mu l t i-sec tora l in terven t ions to address 
pe rs is ten t child malnutrition. 

48. 
The PRSC series w i l l continue t o support hea l th system reforms, inc lud ing imp roved a l loca t ion o f 
f inanc ia l and human resources, strengthened performance con trac t ing and increased f inanc ia l access 
among the poor. W B I w i l l focus o n enhancing loca l capacity fo r con trac t ing human resources and 
manag ing hea l th fac i l i t ies . IDA w i l l also assist government in building capacity to undertake ins t i tu t iona l 
and p o l i c y reforms, as w e l l as p rov ide d irec t support fo r preven t ion and treatment o f ma la r ia and 

- 1 7 - 

HIV/AIDS and upg rad ing o f basic hea l th se rv ices through a Hea l th and HIVIAIDS Sector-wide Support 
Program (FY06). This SWAP w i l l help IDA to consolidate instruments (in par t icu lar the tw o on-go ing 
operations devo ted t o combating HIVlAIDS) wh i le addressing mo re systematically the country’s burden 
o f disease and weak hea l th services capacity. With respect t o HIV/AIDS, IDA w i l l continue to support 
enhanced behav ior change campaigns, strengthened preven t ion programs fo r vulnerable groups, and 
scaling up o f ARV treatment programs through pub l ic-pr iva te partnerships. WBI w i l l strengthen the 
country’s capacity t o manage procurement and log is t ics fo r HIV/AIDS drugs and supplies. To address 
ma lnu tr i t ion , the B a n k w i l l w o r k with the Burkinabt: authorities t o overcome know ledge gaps that prevent 
e f fec t ive action. Ana ly t ic w o r k w i l l be carried out in F Y 0 6 o n the Determinants o f Ch i ldhood 
Ma lnu t r i t ion , with the a im o f in tegra t ing appropriate mu l t i-sec tora l measures (e.g. small-scale l ives tock 
development fo r increased p ro te in intake) in to Burk ina ’s development strategy and IDA support. As with 
education, decentralized hea l th services cou ld figure in a commun i ty -d r iven development mechanism 
toward the end o f the CAS pe r iod i f IDA resources are available and Burk ina ’s decentralization 
performance warrants it. 

2.c. Increased Access to Potable Water and Sanitation Sewices 

49. 

IDA w i l l continue to support Burk ina ’s long- term strategy fo r development o f water supply and 
sanitation, pa r t icu la r ly in fast-growing urban and semi-urban areas where popu la t ion pressure and 
inadequate in fras truc ture are con tr ibu t ing to unhealthy living cond i t ions . The Ouagadougou Water Supply 
Pro jec t has con tr ibu ted to mu l t i -dono r support to drama t ica l ly increase water resources in the cap i ta l c i ty . 
With large-scale c i v i l works completed, IDA funding w i l l support the nex t phase o f ac t iv i ty : construction 
o f secondary and ter t iary ne tworks aimed at doub l ing the number o f household connections and creating 
hundreds o f communa l standpipes in and around Ouagadougou. IDA w i l l increas ing ly rely o n the PRSC 
to support p o l i c y measures and decentralized management o f investments in po tab le water and sanitation 
in secondary u rban areas and semi-urban areas, carry ing fo rwa rd the w o r k begun under the U rban 
Env ironmen t C red i t (and Supplemental Credit), c los ing in December 2005. E f fo r ts w i l l continue to a im 
at (i) deve lop ing adequate water produc t ion capacity in secondary centers covered by na t iona l water 
authority; (ii) ex tend ing the water supply ne twork ; and (iii) suppor t ing soc ia l water connection programs 
to fac i l i ta te access to the poor . Po l icy measures w i l l focus o n strengthening pub l ic-pr iva te partnerships fo r 
urban water supply, enhancing governance in the sector and ma in ta in ing f inanc ia l sustainability. 
Increased a t ten t ion w i l l be given t o a number o f secondary c i t ies considered key t o s t imu la t ing ma rke t ing 
and ago-process ing and o f fe r ing social services t o surround ing r u r a l areas. A capacity building program 
to support decentralized management in these secondary centers and to strengthen loca l p r iva te water 
services prov iders w i l l be prepared in F Y 0 6 to complement the PRSC-supported r e f o rm and rehab i l i ta t ion 
agenda. 

2.d. A Better Targeted Social Protection Strategy 

50. 

Comp le t ion o f a comprehensive Social Pro tec t ion Strategy was a measure supported by PRSC 5 . 
IDA p rov ided b o t h f inanc ia l and technical resources fo r preparation, and w i l l continue to support 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the strategy, pa r t icu la r ly strengthening o f the p o l i c y and f inanc ing framework t o better 
target social protection. WBI w i l l lend i t s support th rough i t s Social Risk Management program. 
Government i s also comp le t ing a strategy to support Orphans and Vu lnerab le Ch i ldren (OVCs) in 
partnership with UN ICEF , IDA and other donors. Fu tu re PRSCs w i l l support development and 
imp lemen ta t ion o f sequenced p lans fo r care and a f fordab le educa t ion fo r OVCs . IDA-funded HIV/AIDS 
operations and the successor Hea l th and HIV/AIDS Sector-wide Support P rog ram w i l l support OVCs

Strategic Objective 3: Increased Employment and Income Opportunities for the Poor 

5 1. 

P i l l a r Three o f the CSLP takes a two-pronged approach to employment and income generation 
issues, focus ing o n labor market po l icy that tends t o a f fec t urban employment, and o n sustainable ru ra l 
development t o address income and employment among the vast ma jo r i ty o f the poo r who reside in ru ra l 
areas. The Bank ’s con tr ibu t ion w i l l a im to support: a) enhanced labor market f l e x i b i l i t y fo r j o b creation; 
b) increased economic opportunities for women; c) reduced r i s k s and increased revenues fo r ru ra l 
households; d) community-based land and na tura l resource management; and e) expanded access to ru ra l 
in fras truc ture . 

3 . a Enhanced Labor Ma rke t Flexibility for Job Creation 

52. 
Governmen t i s rev iew ing Burk ina ’s Emp loymen t Strategy with the a im o f creating a p o l i c y 
env ironmen t mo re conducive to j o b creation. Recent IDA - funded analytic w o r k o n do ing bus iness in 
B u r k i n a was helpful in highlighting areas where Burk ina ’s po l ic ies rema in less f lex ib le than those o f 
developed countries and fas t-grow ing deve lop ing countries. 
IDA i s suppor t ing prepara t ion and

d i rec t ly support j o b creation through operations such as P A C D E (e.g. SME cred i t l i n e ) and PST2 (e.g. 
p r iva te sector road maintenance). 

3.b. Increased Economic Opportunities for Women 

53 . 

Ra is ing female l i teracy rates w i l l fac i l i ta te women’s advancement and understanding o f the ir 
rights. Increas ing women’s par t ic ipa t ion in commun i ty decision-making w i l l beg in to reduce gender 
disparities in access to h igh -qua l i ty land, mode rn inputs, appropriate technology and other income- 
generating assets and opportunities. An ID A - f u n d e d Gender Assessment in 2004 has in f luenced IDA’S 
con t r ibu t ion in this area. The Community-based Ru ra l Deve lopmen t Pro jec t supports empowerment o f 
gender-balanced v i l lage committees to define and imp lemen t loca l development projects, as w e l l as 
l i te racy programs targeted to ru ra l women. In com ing years, the pro jec t w i l l he lp t o increase women’s 
awareness o f the ir rights and imp rove their access t o l a n d -- an area subject t o customary law . PAFASP 
w i l l spec i f ica l ly support organization o f women’s associations fo r production, ma rke t ing and agro- 
processing, as w e l l as access to technology geared t o women’s income-generating ac t iv i t ies . Past 
experience suggests that women w i l l p l a y a leadership ro le in crop d ivers i f ica t ion and small-scale agro- 
processing i f they have equal access to factors o f p roduc t ion and markets. 

3.c. Reduced Risk and Increased Revenues for Ru ra l Households 

54. 
Ag r icu l tu ra l production, inc lud ing crops and livestock, remains the dom inan t source o f revenue 
for r u r a l households. 
Investment and income po ten t ia l are undermined by various r i s k s , inc lud ing 
insecur i ty o f land tenure, reg iona l infestations, an ima l disease outbreaks, per iod ic drought, unpredictable 
water supplies and vo la t i l i ty in the w o r l d co t ton market. 
In tens i f ica t ion and d ive rs i f ica t ion are also 
constrained by underdeveloped ma rke t ing and agro-processing channels. 
IDA i s suppor t ing risk 
reduc t ion through several instruments. Las t year, the coun try j o i n e d i t s neighbors in the ID A - f u n d e d 
A f r i c a n Program to Comba t Locus t Infestation, a imed at deve lop ing reg iona l surveillance and rap id

and modem so i l conservation techniques. At the reques t o f communities, C B R D w i l l n o w beg in 
expanding i t s support to imp lemen t a broader range o f income-generating projects. 

5 5 . 

Th rough PAFASP , IDA w i l l continue to support demand-driven development o f small-scale 
i r r iga t ion -- an area where farmers’ organizations have substantially increased income f r om dry-season 
cu l t iva t ion o f crops such as vegetables. I t w i l l also promote p r iva te investment in agr icu l tura l supply 
chains and adapted agro-processing technology as w e l l as support imp lemen ta t ion o f recommendations 
made in the study L ives tock , Pover ty and Growth in order to reduce vu lne rab i l i ty o f r u r a l households.” 
Support fo r p r iva te sector-led d ivers i f ica t ion w i l l be coupled with continued support to imp rove co t ton 
sector p roduc t iv i ty and competitiveness. WBI w i l l contribute to IDA’S ac t ion through several o f i t s 
programs that link r u r a l development po l ic ies to pover ty reduction; he lp r e f o rm ins t i tu t ions in the context 
o f new land po l ic ies ; and imp rove food qua l i ty and supply chains. T o ensure the sustainability o f these 
interventions, WBI i s strengthening the ab i l i ty o f loca l tra in ing institutes to support the government’s vast

techn ica l schools in the ru ra l sector. 

3.d. Community-based Land and Na tu ra l Resource Management 

56. 

Conserv ing Burk ina ’s b iod ive rs i ty and forest cover, and strengthening sustainable land 
management, are p r io r i t ies to alleviate environmental degradation, promo te renewable energy and 
develop a nascent eco-tourism industry. Government subscribes to the Sustainable L a n d Management 
(SLM) approach embraced by NEPAD to meet the changing needs o f a p c u l t u r e , forestry and 
conservation, wh i le ensuring long - te rm p roduc t iv i ty and eco log ica l func t ion ing o f ecosystems and their 
services. IDA has supported e f for ts t o empower communities to manage scarce resources in co l labora t ion 
with p r iva te sector entrepreneurs. A GEF- funded Partnership fo r Na tu ra l Ecosystem Management 
(PAGEN) prov ides support to r u r a l commun i t ies that have demonstrated willingness to engage in large- 
scale conservation efforts. The program aims to strengthen management and revenue-generating capacity 
within a three-way partnership o f the forest and w i l d l i f e administration, l o c a l commun i t ies and pr iva te 
sector tou r ism operators. In support o f the Na t iona l P lan to Combat Deser t i f ica t ion , the GEF-financed 
Sahel Integrated L ow l a n d Ecosystem Management (SILEM) p rog ram wo rks within the C B R D framework 
t o strengthen ru ra l commun i t ies capacity t o assess, p lan and manage land and other na tura l resources and 
participate in development decision-making with other partners. 

3.e. Expanded Access to R u r a l Infrastructure 

57. 

Ra is ing ru ra l incomes r e q u i r e s phys ica l access to markets and a f fordab le energy fo r income- 
generating ac t iv i t ies -- b o t h o f wh ich have tangible hea l th and education bene f i ts fo r ru ra l communities as

Strategic Objective 4: Better Governance with Greater Decentralization 

58. 
T h e CSLP recognizes that governance affects the achievement o f development outcomes across 
a l l strategic p i l la rs and sectors. W h i l e in troduc ing governance issues across the spectrum, the CSLP 
r e t a i n s a separate p i l l a r o n P romo t ing Good Governance in order to he igh ten the visibility o f re forms 
re la ted t o fairness, transparency, accountability and pa r t ic ipa t ion in pub l ic l i fe . The Bank w i l l also 
incorporate governance issues broad ly throughout i t s sectoral support. Par t icu lar emphasis w i l l be p laced 
o n the C A S con t r ibu t ion to three intermediate outcomes: a) a more e f f ic ien t jud ic ia ry fo r commerc ia l 
cases; b) imp roved pub l ic resource management in a decentralized context; and c) increased loca l 
capacity and pa r t ic ipa t ion in pub l ic po l icy decisions. 

4 .a A M o r e Efficient Judiciary for Commercial Cases 

59. 
Ex te rna l partners share government’s v iew that a we l l - func t ion ing j u d i c i a l system i s cruc ia l to 
imp rov ing governance, comba t ing corruption, and conso l ida t ing the democratic order. Several o f them 
are supporting b road re forms o f the jud ic ia l system. IDA w i l l con tr ibu te by focus ing o n strengthening 
j u d i c i a l processes and commerc ia l chambers fo r rap id reso lu t ion o f bus iness cases. The on-go ing 
Competitiveness and Enterprise Development Project (PACDE) w i l l p rov ide fo r tra in ing o f magistrates, 
development o f procedura l manuals and pub l ica t ion o f decisions, as well as con t inu ing t o support 
harmon iza t ion o f bus iness l a w w i t h i n the O H A D A framework and strengthening the arb i tra t ion process in 
B u r h n a . Key measures to strengthen jud ic ia l processes in this area w i l l be supported under PRSCs 6 
through 9. In support o f IDA’S action, WBI w i l l continue t o assist the key na t iona l stakeholders in 
identifying and addressing the factors that a f fec t performance o f the jud ic ia ry based on the experience o f 
countries that have faced, or are s t i l l facing, situations s im i lar t o Bu rk ina Faso’s. W B I ’ s support w i l l also 
be extended to the leg is la t ive branch where the dua l focus w i l l be o n strengthening the capacity o f 
par l iamen t in exerc is ing i t s budgetary oversight respons ib i l i ty and t ra in ing o f parliamentary staff. 

4.b. Improved Public Resource Management i n a Decentralized Context 

60. 
Adop t ion o f the L a w o n L o c a l Adm in is t ra t ion in late 2004 paves the way fo r further 
deconcentration and decentralization o f pub l ic respons ib i l i t ies and resources. T h e PRSC series has 
supported considerable progress in pub l ic resource management, and w i l l continue to do so within the 
FY06 -09 CAS . P r io r i t ies w i l l inc lude further deconcentration o f budge t processes and development o f 
sectoral p rog ram budgets and medium-term expenditure frameworks; strengthened budget execution and 
oversight, deconcentration o f human resource management, especially in the hea l th and education sectors; 
c lear ly de f ined respons ib i l i t ies and resource transfers fo r decentralized leve ls o f government; increased 
transparency o f pub l ic procurement and enforcement o f sanctions; and strengthened state inspec t ion 
agencies. Recommendations o f the par t ic ipa tory Pub l ic Expend i ture Rev iew and j o i n t Coun try 
Procurement Assessment Repor t are be ing incorporated in Government’s P lan fo r Strengthening Budget 
Management (PRGB) and w i l l be re f lec ted in fu ture PRSCs. Ana ly t ic w o r k o n pub l ic expenditures, 
f inanc ia l management and procurement w i l l be updated in F Y 0 7 and FY08 . An impor tan t complement t o 
the PRSC series w i l l be the recen t ly approved Pub l ic Adm in is t ra t ion Capac i ty Building Pro jec t (PRCA). 
I t was designed to fill gaps in support fo r central m in is tr ies ’ p lans to carry ou t cross-cutting re forms o f 
pub l ic finance and administration. L im i t e d progress in cross-cutting areas such as c i v i l service re fo rm has 
undermined Burk ina ’s ab i l i ty to deepen economic reforms, decentralize pub l ic service de l ivery and 
increase transparency throughout the system. T o strengthen capacity t o decentralize pub l ic service 
delivery, WBI w i l l o f fe r a p rog ram fo r reg iona l governors t o better understand the ro le they can p lay in 
carry ing ou t decentralization po l icy .

4.c. Increased Local Capacity and Participation in Public Policy Decisions 

61. 
Rev is ion o f the CSLP benefited f r om increased c i v i l society participation, inc lud ing development 
o f reg iona l CSLPs as an input to the na t iona l leve l strategy. I t also benefited f r om a mo re results-oriented 
approach to a r t icu la t ing objectives and defining a mon i to r ing system. Access to re l iab le in fo rma t ion and 
increased flexibility to adapt strategies w i l l be essential fo r a l l actors -- Government o f f ic ia ls , pr iva te 
sector and l o c a l communities -- in order to achieve better development resu l ts . The C A S w i l l support 
increased know ledge and t h e strengthening o f loca l capacity to manage fo r results. The Commun i ty - 
based Ru ra l Deve lopmen t Project (FY03) and i t s second phase (FY07) w i l l continue to support 
government ’s Programme Na t iona l de Gestion des Terro irs (PNGT2). This commun i ty -d r iven approach 
has been a p r ima ry instrument for building v i l lage- leve l management capacity, and w i l l b e expanded as 
r u r a l communes are established and decentralization gathers steam. WBI w i l l complement IDA’s e f for ts 
by p romo t ing stakeholders’ par t ic ipa t ion in the p o l i c y dialogue. In particular, WB I w i l l contribute to 
development o f an enabling environment fo r the med ia and fo r free exchange o f in forma t ion , as w e l l as 
suppor t ing ac t iv i t ies aimed at commun i ty empowerment. 

62. 
Bu rk ina Faso i s also a p i l o t coun try fo r the Bank’s StatCap Program (PDSSN), linked closely to 
mon i to r ing and evaluation o f the CSLP. The p rog ram w i l l a im t o enhance the re l iab i l i ty o f core statistics 
and increase capacity to use and interpret statistics fo r evidence-based decision-making at the po l icy , 
p rog ram and commun i ty levels. The IDA-funded G loba l Distance Lea rn ing Center o f Ouagadougou 
(CEDO) w i l l begin operations in 2005, o f fe r ing greater access to the g loba l learn ing ne twork . Bu rk ina i s 
also a focus coun try for the W o r l d Bank Institute, w h i c h w i l l r e l y o n C EDO fo r workshops and courses, 
as w e l l as o f fe r n ew products geared to capacity enhancement, fac i l i ta ted coun try dialogue and imp roved 
access to reg iona l and g loba l experience. WBI ac t iv i t ies w i l l be linked t o other elements o f the coun try 
program, and w i l l focus o n governance issues (PRSP mon i tor ing , Parliamentary oversight, j u d i c i a l 
re form , and comba t ing corruption) and community-based development (land tenure, basic social 
services). 

D. I D A Instruments 

1. Analytic Work 

63. 
IDA’s support fo r par t ic ipa tory ana ly t ic w o r k in FYO1-05 has enriched strategy development and 
p o l i c y debate within Burkina, as w e l l as p rov id ing a strong founda t ion fo r the upcom ing CAS . An IDA- 
supported week- long Pover ty and Pub l ic Expenditure F o r um in 2004 p rov ided an oppor tun i ty fo r 
government, c i v i l society and external partners t o move f r om a b road discussion o f pove r ty trends and 
characteristics (supported by the Pover ty Assessment) to a rev iew o f the linkages be tween na t iona l 
strategy and pub l ic expenditures (supported by the Pub l ic Expenditure Rev iew) and then, mo re narrow ly , 
t o the con t r ibu t ion o f the W o r l d Bank (supported by a results-oriented Coun try Po r t fo l io Rev iew) . This 
l u c k - o f f event fo r preparation o f the C A S was deemed so use fu l by participants that i t i s l i k e l y t o become 
a b i-annua l feature o f the Bank -Bu rk ina partnership.

S imp l i f ica t ion o f instruments, harmonization with partners and support for coun try systems w i l l 
be exp l ic i t IDA goals during this CAS period. Support w i l l be channeled t o three levels relying on th ree 
t y p e s o f instruments. Development policy loans w i l l continue to support imp lemen ta t ion o f the CSLP 
through the na t iona l budget. Sector interventions -- increasingly through poo led sector-wide approaches 
(SWAPS) -- w i l l support ins t i tu t iona l development and e f f i c i e n t service de l ivery in p r i o r i t y sectors. 
Community-based approaches w i l l be the instrument o f choice to support decentralized development. 

65. 
Continued development policy lending. S e l f - and independent evaluations o f the f i r s t PRSC 
s e r i e s in Bu rk ina concluded that increased reliance o n development p o l i c y lending has e f fec t ive ly 
supported imp lemen ta t ion o f the CSLP while imp rov ing p red ic tab i l i ty o f a i d f lows and encouraging 
harmon iza t ion and a l ignmen t among external  partner^.'^ Support through the PRSC instrument rose f r om 
about a quarter o f IDA commitments in FY02-03 to more than h a l f in FY04-05 . As Bu rk ina implements 
i t s second-generation CSLP, IDA can do more to ensure that the next PRSC series i s increas ing ly results- 
focused, better harmon ized with other budget support and s treng thens na t iona l capacity t o mon i to r and 
evaluate progress. The PRSC series w i l l be accompanied by capac i ty-bu i ld ing operations to support 
r e f o rm o f pub l ic adm in is tra t ion and strengthening o f coun try systems. 

Greater movement toward sector-wide approaches. 

66. 
Increased f l e x i b i l i t y o f Bank po l ic ies w i l l 
fac i l i ta te a more pronounced movement towa rd sector-wide approaches built around med ium- term 
expenditure frameworks, poo led donor funding, harmonized procedures, and home-grown mon i to r ing and 
eva lua t ion systems. Currently, Burk ina ’s imp lemen ta t ion capacity in key sectors i s sorely taxed by 
donors’ continued reliance o n a fi-agmented pro jec t approach and diverse procedures -- even where the 
coun try has established a sector-wide strategy and med ium- term expenditure framework. Progress towa rd 
poo led SWAPS with harmonized procedures w i l l be made in education, transport, hea l th and HIV/AIDs. 
On-go ing in terven t ions in water supply and power generation support sector-wide strategies in 
partnership with other donors, but are e f f ic ien t ly coordinated as stand-alone pro jec ts fo r large-scale 
infrastructure inves tmen ts . 

67. 
Expanded community-driven development. Government’s PNG T 2 has been no tab ly successful 
in strengthening v i l lage- leve l capacity to carry ou t projects -- such as building schools and anti-erosion 
barriers -- more e f f ic ien t ly than through trad i t iona l Governmenb‘donor mechanisms. IDA w i l l continue to 
support government’s mode l fo r commun i ty-dr iven development through the f i r s t and second phases o f 
the Community-based Ru ra l Deve lopmen t Project. In so doing, IDA w i l l j o i n with other external partners 
in evaluating experience to date and he lp ing government t o re f ine a mode l around w h i c h donor funds can 
be aligned. IDA w i l l also support expansion o f a commun i ty-dr iven approach fo r decentralized de l ivery

sectoral and thema t ic groups to encourage a broad partnership fo r imp lemen ta t ion and mon i to r ing -- 
a l though e f f ic ien t func t ion ing o f this mechanism remains a challenge. 

1. IDA ’s Partnership with Development Agencies 

6 9 . 

IDA and the other branches of the W o r l d Bank G roup collaborate with a range o f development 
agencies ac t ive in Bu rk ina I6 . This has been facilitated by increased decentralization o f strategic p lann ing 
and task leadership t o the Bank’s Coun try Office in Ouagadougou. W e l l before the adop t ion o f a full 
CSLP in 2000, Bu rk ina ’s partners began mov ing beyond “projectized” aid, toward a programma t ic 
approach a l igned with the country’s pr ior i t ies and budget cycle. Progress o n this f ron t has been notable, 
with the CSLP se rv ing as a focal po in t for a l ign ing support, inc lud ing IDA ’S PRSC series, four successive 
programs under the IMF’s Pover ty Reduc t ion and G row th Fac i l i ty and budget support f r om the European 
U n i o n and var ious member states. Under EU leadership, a memorandum o f understanding (MOU ) was 
signed in 2002 among the EU and five b i la tera l donors fo r the harmon iza t ion o f budget support. IDA 
wo rked very c lose ly with this group and with the IMF to coordinate preparation o f the i n i t i a l PRSC series 
to better a l ign with the budget cycle. IDA works within i t s UN fam i ly as we l l , co l labora t ing spec i f ica l ly 
o n economic management, r u r a l development and de l ive ry o f social services. In the com ing year, the 
A f r ican Deve lopmen t Bank w i l l be opening a loca l o f f ice in Ouagadougou that w i l l strengthen the on- 
go ing partnership with IDA in areas such as transport and comba t ing HIV/AIDS, as w e l l as a l l ow the 
AfDB t o better harmon ize with other partners at the na t iona l and sectoral l e v e l s . 
In January 2005, government and i t s partners -- inc lud ing the W o r l d Bank and the A f r ican 
Deve lopmen t B a n k -- signed a path-breaking MOU tha t creates a common framework fo r assessing 
budget support based o n macroeconomic performance, pub l ic sector resource management and 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the CSLP. Further e f for ts w i l l focus o n strengthening na t iona l mon i to r ing and 
eva lua t ion systems, imp rov ing alignment with the budget cyc le and s tream l in ing donor missions. At the 
sectoral leve l , IDA task teams w o r k closely and p roduc t ive ly with partners, par t ic ipa t ing in j o i n t missions 
and rev iews in areas such as transport, education and community-based development. However , 
partnership must progress towa rd more concrete actions to harmonize procedures and repo r t ing 
requirements around coun try systems. High-level comm i tmen t t o th is goa l among development agencies 
has n o t always been matched by increased ins t i tu t iona l f l e x i b i l i t y to do so. 
IDA has taken some 
impor tan t strides in this d i rec t ion -- much appreciated by the Bu rk inabk -- but task teams need t o 
in terna l ize and take advantage o f th is flexibility in wo rk ing with other partners. In the com ing year, IDA 
w i l l j o i n with several other partners to establish a mu l t i-agency harmon iza t ion team in Bu rk ina aimed at 
iden t i fy ing and overcom ing donor obstacles t o harmon ized action.

Academics, non-governmental organizations, p r iva te entrepreneurs and communities have had 
successful pub l ic-pr iva te partnerships with IDA and with government under IDA-funded activities. Some 
notable examples inc lude wo rk ing through non-governmental organizations fo r community-based

F. I D A F i n a n c i n g Scenarios 

72. 
S trong performance in macroeconomic management and imp lemen ta t ion o f structural measures 
within the CSLP framework, coupled with large ly satisfactory imp lemen ta t ion o f the IDA po r t fo l io (albeit 
w i t h a need t o accelerate disbursements) have given Bu rk ina Faso access to s ign i f ican t IDA resources in 
the FY01 -05 per iod . Commitments averaged U S $ 1 3 8 m i l l i o n per annum against an i n i t i a l coun try 
a l loca t ion o f around US$123 m i l l i o n per annum. l7 Forty-seven percent o f th is was in the f o rm o f grants 
in the FY03 -05 period.

progress in macroeconomic management, pub l ic resource management and imp lemen ta t ion o f the rev ised 
CSLP, strong and predictable support f r om IDA i s warranted. The base case scenario proposes an 
ind ica t ive envelope for IDA commitments o f U S 1 4 0 m i l l i o n per annum during FY06 -09 (equivalent to 
an IDA a l loca t ion o f SDR 94 m i l l i o n fo r FY06) . This scenario wou ld support pro jec ted rea l g row th o f 
4.8 percent per annum, based o n modest g row th o f co t ton exports, moderate g row th o f non-co t ton exports 
and sustained levels o f a id in f lows . Ac tua l allocations w i l l depend on Burkma 's own p o l i c y and po r t fo l io 
performance, i t s performance re la t ive t o other IDA recipients, and the amount o f ove ra l l resources 
available IDA. I t w i l l also depend o n the terms o f the f inanc ia l assistance prov ided . Based o n i t s current 
debt vu lne rab i l i ty and C P I A rating, Bu rk ina i s considered ineligible fo r IDA grants in FY06 . However , i f 
found to be moderately debt-distressed in f u t u r e years, Bu rk ina w o u l d be e l ig ib le t o receive h a l f o f i t s

Iv. MANAGING AND MONITORING THE COUNTRY PROGRAM 

A. Po r t fo l io Managemen t 

76. 
Burk ina ’s IDA po r t fo l io consists o f 14 active operations with to ta l ne t comm i tmen ts o f US$528 
m i l l i o n , o f wh ich US$357 i s curren t ly undisbursed. T h e nature and compos i t ion o f the po r t fo l io evo lved 
during the last C A S pe r iod w i t h the transition to a programmatic approach and the in troduc t ion o f 
commun i ty -d r iven development mechanisms. During the FY06 -09 period, fur ther progress toward a 
programma t ic approach w i l l be made, reducing the number o f active country-based operations f r om 14 to 
around 8 by the end o f the CAS period. Rema in ing operations w i l l inc lude capacity building to 
complement the PRSCs (e.g. PRCA , StatCap) sector-wide approaches for ins t i tu t iona l development 
(education, health), p i l o t operations and large-scale infrastructure projects (e.g. energy and water supply). 
B u r km a w i l l also participate in four reg iona l operations by the end o f the C A S per iod . 

Portfolio performance. 

77. 
In general, po r t fo l io performance in the past CAS pe r iod was 
satisfactory, b o t h fo r achievement o f development objectives and imp lemen ta t ion progress. One recent 
opera t ion -- Deve lopmen t o f the Na t iona l Statistical System -- i s judged “at r i s k ” . The Basic Educa t ion 
Sector Program i s also suffering f r om imp lemen ta t ion bottlenecks, and w i l l b e restructured as a 
harmon ized sector-wide approach during i t s mid-term rev iew in M a y 2005. 

78 . 

Imp lementat ion bottlenecks. S low imp lemen ta t ion has been a p rob lem in Bu rk ina pa r t icu la r ly 
because o f effectiveness delays o f anywhere f r om six months to eighteen mon ths due to comp l ica ted 
j u d i c i a l and 
leg is la t ive procedures, cumbersome na t iona l procurement procedures and weak 
imp lemen ta t ion capacity in m in is tr ies and other agencies. This has led to repe t i t ive extensions o f c los ing 
dates and inadequate disbursement ratios. Disbursement was pa r t icu la r ly l o w in F Y 0 2 and FY03 (13-14 
percent disbursement ratio), but has r i s e n to 19-20 percent fo r F Y 0 4 and FY05 . 

Accelerating effectiveness and disbursement. A v i s i t by LEGAF t o B u r k i n a in April 2005 

79. 
launched a dialogue o n streamlining procedures fo r effectiveness w h i c h i s expected t o alleviate the 
prob lem . E f fo r ts are underway to r e f o rm na t iona l procurement procedures, but progress needs to be more 
rap id and results-oriented. To this end, IDA and AfDB are j o i n t l y wo rk ing with the Bu rk inabk to prepare 
a Coun t ry Procurement Assessmen t Repor t (CPAR). The ac t ion p l a n ar is ing f r om t h i s w o r k w i l l be the 
basis fo r re forms supported by PRSCs 6-9. Perhaps mos t helpful w i l l be IDA’S e f for ts to app ly n ew 
p o l i c y flexibility (such as the Coun t ry F inanc ing Parameters), use s imp l i f ied instruments and adopt 
harmon ized approaches to reduce the transaction costs o f dea l ing with mu l t ip le development partners 
with differing procedures and repo r t ing requirements. 

80. 
Strengthening the focus on results. A results-based Coun t ry Po r t fo l io Performance Rev iew 
(CPPR) carr ied out in November 2004 demonstrated the scope to better de f ine expected results and link 
them to the na t iona l CSLP, t o develop mon i to r ing and evaluation systems tha t go beyond f inanc ia l and 
phys ica l outputs to assess development outcomes and to build na t iona l capacity t o ca r ry ou t results-based 
mon i to r ing and evaluation at the national, sectoral and decentralized levels. Newe r operations were far 
mo re likely to have a results-based mon i to r ing and eva lua t ion system, tra ined s ta f f and appropriate 
baseline data -- although they s t i l l tend to focus mo re o n outputs than o n the outcomes upon w h i c h the 
ac t iv i ty must u l t ima te ly be judged. 

B. Results-Based Mon i to r ing and Eva lua t ion o f the CAS 

81. 
The mon i to r ing and eva lua t ion framework fo r the C A S re f lec ts that o f the CSLP with w h i c h i t i s 
aligned. Mon i to r ing and evaluation o f the CSLP i s overseen by an in te r -m in is te r ia l Steering Comm i t tee 
assisted by sectoral and thematic groups composed o f government technicians, external partners and 

- 28 - 

representatives o f c i v i l society. A results-based approach was in troduced in fo rmu la t ing the P r io r i ty 
A c t i o n P lan (PAP), w h i c h l e d to more outcome-oriented ar t icu la t ion o f coun try p r io r i t ies and to a clearer 
set o f ind ica tors f o r mon i to r ing progress and evaluating outcomes. No tab ly , the P A P succeeded in 
identifying 24 core indicators -- inc lud ing a number o f country-specific MDG ind ica tors -- among a more 
comprehensive set o f sectoral indicators. T h e core indicators der ive f r om ex is t ing na t iona l and sectoral 
statistical systems and were chosen o n the basis o f their relevance as w e l l as the re la t ive re l iab i l i ty o f 
data. The Governmen t has made e f for ts to improve the frequency and re l iab i l i ty o f data w i t h support 
f r om external partners, inc lud ing establishing a Pover ty Observatory, and carry ing ou t per iod ic pove r ty 
assessments and surveys such as the 2003 Demographic and Hea l th Survey. W h i l e progress has been 
made in defining the CSLP mon i to r ing and evaluation framework, much mo re w o r k i s needed t o 
strengthen Governmen t and c i v i l society mon i to r ing capacity, and t o a l ign sectoral systems t o contribute 
systematically t o ove ra l l CSLP mon i tor ing . 

82. 
CAS results framework. 
With the CSLP as a foundation, CAS preparation began with 
development o f a results framework linking the IDA program t o coun try pr ior i t ies . The results-based 
approach s t imu la ted greater cross-sectoral discussion o n expected outcomes and e f fec t ive strategies. The 
r e s u l t s framework i d e n t i f i e s outcomes to wh ich the CAS can contribute, as w e l l as measurable indicators 
fo r evaluating these outcomes upon completion. I t also iden t i f ies m id - te rm progress indicators that focus 
o n k e y p o l i c y measures and actions needed to achieve resu l ts . F igu re 3 summarizes the core C A S 
indicators iden t i f ied in the results framework (Annex 1). Three-fourths o f the core indicators are d i rec t ly 
f r om the PAP . Several others are f r om sectoral mon i to r ing systems supported by IDA, o r are components 
o f composite CSLP indicators, deemed more relevant to mon i to r the IDA-funded program. They inc lude 
9 o f the 14 outcome indicators mon i tored across countries within the 14 IDA results measurement 
system.’l The core ind ica tors and the supporting results framework w i l l help IDA assess progress and 
mod i fy strategy as necessary at mid-term and comp le t ion t o rema in a relevant and e f fec t ive development 
partner. 

83. 
S imp l i j icat ion and harmonization. Progress o n s imp l i f ica t ion o f instruments and harmon iza t ion 
o f procedures and repo r t ing around coun try systems i s an exp l ic i t goa l o f the FY06 -09 CAS . Progress 
w i l l be assessed o n the basis o f i) the share o f IDA comm i tmen ts in poo led funding arrangements 
( inc lud ing budget support); ii) the share o f on-going IDA operations using regu lar j o i n t donor supervision 
missions/reviews, iii) the share o f IDA tasks (operations and ESW) l e d f r om the f ie ld ; and iv) the share o f 
IDA operations relying o n unified repo r t ing systems. These performance ind ica tors w i l l be used to assess 
progress at m id - te rm and upon comp le t ion o f the CAS . 

84. 
Strengthening country systems. 
The results-based CPPR showed progress among newer 
operations in defining a mon i to r ing and evaluation framework at an ear ly stage, and in strengthening 
na t iona l and sectoral systems, rather than establishing parallel, pro jec t-spec i f ic systems. No tab le 
examples inc luded the Transport Sector Program, H I V / A I D S Disaster Response Program and the 
Community-base Ru ra l Deve lopmen t Project, wh ich p rov ided use fu l lessons fo r decentralized mon i to r ing 
systems. M o r e progress shou ld be made during the C A S pe r iod t o use ID A - f u n d e d operations to support 
na t iona l and sector systems, and in he lp ing these systems ex tend beyond mon i to r ing o f inputs and 
phys ica l outputs t o track outcomes that affect Burkinab2. we l l-be ing . Movemen t towa rd harmonized 
sector-wide and community-base approaches shou ld d r ive this progress, as w i l l specific interventions to 
build statistical and results-based mon i to r ing and eva lua t ion capacity. 

*’ The rema in ing 5 outcome ind ica tors o f the IDA r e s u l t s measurement system were n o t inc luded due t o 
measurement constraints ( H I V / A I D S prevalence, p u b l i c expenditure management, and telecommunications) o r

85 . 

In the next four years, Bu rk ina Faso faces r i s k s in achieving development objectives and 
imp lemen t ing the IDA program, some o f wh ich cannot be easily m i t iga ted through government 

in terven t ion . Am o n g these, the evolution o f wo r ld ma rke t prices fo r cotton and the do l lar exchange 

r a t e are perhaps the most intractable and mos t damaging to future g row th prospects. A permanent 
adjustment o f the co t ton sector to lowe r rea l prices may be necessary. Strategy in the co t ton sector 
already aims to reduce this risk, by focusing on increased p roduc t iv i ty and competitiveness with greater 
p r iva te sector invo lvemen t . Faster and deeper re fo rm may prove necessary, coup led with redoubled 
e f for ts t o diversify agr icu l tura l and other exports. In the meantime, government w i l l continue t o p l a y a 
lead ing ro le among cotton-producing countries in advocating reduced subsidies and better marke t access 
in the developed wo r ld . IDA w i l l p rov ide predictable but f lex ib le support th rough PRSCs to support 
Bu rk ina ’s co t ton sector measures. 

86. 

Con t inued sub-regional po l it ica l instab i l ity also threatens to increase transport costs, tam ish the 
investment c l ima te and hinder efforts fo r economic integration. Bu rk ina has m i t iga ted negative impacts 
through d ive rs i f ica t ion o f i t s transport routes in recent years, and has made a comm i tmen t t o imp rov ing 
the domestic inves tmen t c l ima te even in a less-than-optimal sub-regional environment. In the past few 
years, Bu rk ina has developed a mo re v is ib le presence in sub-regional and reg iona l institutions, inc lud ing 
the A f r ican U n i o n and NEPAD , as w e l l as ra is ing i t s p ro f i le as a re l iab le partner in the g loba l arena. 

87. 

In terna l ly , development progress cou ld be hampered b y inadequate progress on adm in istrat ive 
deconcentration and po l it ica l decentralization. Adop t ion o f a clear lega l framework was s low and 
fraugh t with controversy. N o w that the lega l framework i s in place, government has taken measures to 
imp rove the prospects fo r m o v i n g forward, pa r t icu la r ly by reach ing ou t t o loca l p rog ram coordinators 
throughout the coun try to build support. Ex terna l partners consider this a p r i o r i t y fo r imp roved a id 
effectiveness, and IDA w i l l support a well-sequenced process through ana ly t ic work , PRSCs and related 
capac i ty-bu i ld ing operations. 

As IDA increas ing ly adopts a programmatic approach in Burk ina , the greatest risk to C A S 

88. 
imp lemen ta t ion remains the f iduc ia ry r i s k o f insufficient transparency and accountability in public 
resource management and pub l ic procurement. M i t i g a t i o n has invo lved mak ing budget and 

expenditure management the s ine qua non o f PRSC support, and back ing i t up with analytic w o r k that 
he lps the authorities implement the ir budget management p l a n and deepen pub l ic procurement reform, 
w h i c h has been timid in the past. Government w i l l continue t o expand use o f p rog ram budgets linked to 
med ium- term expenditure frameworks, as w e l l as deconcentration o f paymen t au thor iza t ion and 
expenditure track ing systems.

March 2005 

Introduction 

The d ra f t Coun t ry Assistance Strategy was presented and discussed in various fora during M a r c h 
2005. The ob jec t ive was to increase pub l ic awareness o f the strategy document and to so l ic i t 
feedback o n the likely relevance and effectiveness o f the proposed coun try program. A much- 
appreciated and enr ich ing innova t ion o f this consultation process was to meet with trad i t iona l ch ie f 
and re l ig ious leaders, who rema in very in f luen t ia l within Burk inabk society, and to create teams o f 
loca l s ta f f t o carry out v i l lage- leve l consultations in three geographically and l ingu is t ica l ly d is t inc t

CAS i s we l l-a l igned with Burk ina ’s CSLP and with the needs o f the Burk inabk people as 
perceived by these focus groups. 
The Bank ’s e f fo r t to consult i s appreciated, but i s too rare, pa r t icu la r ly at decentralized levels. 
Ex terna l outreach must be intensified. 
Areas where the Bank strategy i s perceived to be most relevant: 
+:e Suppor t ing water management fo r small-scale irr iga t ion . 
Increas ing access to potable water. 
Comba t ing ma lar ia in add i t ion to HIV/AIDS. 
4 4 P romo t ing income-generating activities 
fo r women 
through access 
appropriate technology (par t icu lar ly fo r agricultural processing). 
Deve lop ing affordable energy options for ru ra l areas. 
In t e rm s o f instruments, those consulted expressed the v iews that: 
Commun i ty -d r iven development i s an excellent too l to support Burk ina ’s decentralization, 
but needs to be better-funded and expanded to support income-generating activities. 
4 4 Sector-wide approaches are better than projects, but stakeholders are frustrated by the 
i n a b i l i t y o f ex tema l partners to harmonize procedures and engage in co l lec t ive action.

I FC currentpor lfo l io: I F C has n o t been very active in Bu rk ina in t e rm s o f investments (no n ew 
investment in over four years). However, there have been a number o f business development 
missions tha t l o o k p rom is ing in recent months. 
IFC ’s current investment po r t fo l io to ta l ing 
US$617,000 consists o f an equity investment in a bank (the loca l a f f i l ia te o f Ecobank) and a 
guarantee t o a t ruck ing operator. I F C i s curren t ly f ina l iz ing a po ten t ia l $2.4 m i l l i o n investment in

FC ’ s strategy fo r Bu rk ina Faso i s focused on: (i) imp rov ing the investment c l ima te (ii) building 
up the capacity of SMEs and m ic ro enterprises and o f ins t i tu t ions that can support them; and 
(iii) proac t ive support to pro jec t development in financial, tou r ism and mining sector. 

SME development: Ove r the last two fiscal years, the A fk ica Pro jec t Deve lopmen t Fac i l i ty 
(APDF) p rov ided t ra in ing to 44 SME staff, 5 5 consultants and 27 f inanc ia l ins t i tu t ion staff, and 
supported one business association. The Fore ign Investment Adv iso ry Service (FIAS) also has an 
on-go ing p rog ram t o advise a ministry o n compe t i t ion po l icy , barriers 
to en t ry and 
an t icompe t i t ive practices in four sectors (meauleather, h i t s and vegetables, cotton, and 
commerc ia l distribution). 
The compe t i t ion p o l i c y repo r t was submitted t o the Burk inabe 
Government in June 2004 and presented at a stakeholder seminar in Ouagadougou in November 
2004. 

Investment Climate: Improvements in the investment c l ima te i s fundamental to pr iva te sector

Progress to date has been limited and the Government has so l ic i ted mo re assistance f r om the 
W o r l d Bank . In response to the Government’s request, I F C intends to scale up i t s technical 
assistance through FIAS and others un i tdprograms that are already ac t ive in the country. IFC ’s 
Pr iva te Enterprise Partnership for A f r i c a (PEP Africa), in co l labora t ion with FIAS, i s propos ing a 
30-mon th p rog ram to imp rove the business c l ima te in Bu rk ina Faso focus ing o n the fo l low ing 
five components: (i) business reg is tra t ion and start-up, s tream l in ing procedures to reduce t ime

REMARKS/EXPLANATION 

Bank f inanc ing fo r ind iv idua l pro jec ts may be up t o 
100 % o f pro jec t costs. Th is , w o u l d be determined 
by: (i) the ava i lab i l i ty o f the IDA f inanc ing envelope 
and, (ii) the p r io r i t iza t ion ou t l ined in the rev ised 
PRSP and the new CAS . Full f inanc ing o f p ro jec t 
costs i s expected to be app l ied selectively, p r ima r i ly 
for operations supporting reg iona l HIV/AIDS 
programs and r e f o rm efforts. Cost sharing w i l l l i k e l y 
be the r u l e in projects with con tr ibu t ions f r om other 
sources than Government, co- f inanc ing by other 
donors, and projects with revenue generating and 
SWAP mechanisms. 
G iven the country’s frag i le f inanc ia l situation, the 
Bank w i l l continue to mon i to r the aggregate f isca l and 
debt situation, and i t s imp l ica t ions fo r recurrent cost 
financing. In a l l cases, recurrent cost f inanc ing w i l l 
be app l ied after consideration o f sector and pro jec t 
sustainability issues inc lud ing : (i) ins t i tu t iona l 
arrangements to a l low fo r greater emphasis o n 
sustainability through result-based M&E systems, and 
strengthening o f capacity at na t iona l and loca l level; 
and (ii) imp l ied fu ture budget outlays. 
The cr i ter ia fo r Bank f inanc ing o f loca l costs are met. 
Therefore, the B a n k may finance l o c a l costs in any 
propor t ions as needed fo r ind iv idua l projects. 

None 

Curren t ly , there are n o excessive taxes o r duties in 
Bu rk ina Faso. At the project-level, the B a n k w o u l d 
consider whether taxes and duties constitute an 
excessively high share o f p ro jec t costs.

Annex 5: Burkina Faso’s Progress in Achieving Selected 
Millennium Development Goals between 1990 and 2015 

Goa l I : Erad icate extreme poverty and hunger. 

Ha lve the p ropo r t ion of peop le whose income is less than $1 a day i n purchas ing power pa r i ty 
terms. Econom ic g row th and the impac t o f pub l ic po l ic ies - pa r t icu la r ly in ru ra l areas - have 
reduced the inc idence of pover ty by 8 percentage po in ts over the pe r iod 1998-2003, fo r a 
headcount ind ica to r o f 46 percent in 2003. The headcount for 1990 i s n o t available, but the 1994 
figure can be used as a starting po in t since i t was also close to a measure o f $1 pe r day in PPP 
terms. A cons is ten t ly measured pover ty headcount rate fo r 1994 w o u l d be around 60 percent, so 
that the MDG target by 2015 wou ld be approximately 30 percent. Based o n the current trend in 
pover ty reduction, th is MDG target wou ld be met by 201 5. 

Ha lve the p ropo r t ion of peop le who sufer from hunger. The latest Demograph ic and Hea l th 
Survey indicates that c h i l d ma lnu t r i t ion (underweight) has increased f r om 29 percent in 1993 to 
38 percent in 2003, despite the decline in ru ra l pover ty . W h i l e ma lnu t r i t ion has multiple causes, 
and improvemen ts in nu t r i t ion indicators can lag g row th improvements, fur ther analysis i s 
necessary t o better understand trends and propose appropriate in terven t ions to achieve the goal. 

Goal 2: Achieve universal pr imary education and literacy 

Ensure tha t a l l children-boys and girls-can complete a f u l l course of p r im a r y schooling. The 
gross p r ima ry enro l lmen t rate stood at 30 percent in 1990 and 52 percent in 2004. The universal 
education target in the MDGs w i l l mos t likely n o t be reached by 2015, a l though great progress 
has been recorded in t e rm s o f school coverage. Even ma lung the op t im is t ic assumption that the 
na t iona l target o f 70 percent by 2010 wou ld be met--that i s to say three percentage po in ts increase 
per annum f r om 2004 onwards, the gross enro l lmen t rate w o u l d reach around 86 percent in 2015. 
At this pace, un iversa l p r ima ry enro l lmen t cou ld be achieved on ly by 2020, and p r ima ry 
comp le t ion rates w o u l d l a g behind. 

Ensure that a l l adults a re l i tera te . Regard ing the adu l t l i te racy ra te ( fo r ages 15-24), the coun try 
i s mak ing progress (18.4 percent in 1998 and 32 percent in 2003). I f things continue at the 
cu r ren t pace (up 2.7 percentage po in ts annually), the na t iona l target o f 4 0 percent by 2010 cou ld 
be reached, but the l i te racy rate w o u l d probab ly be about 60 percent in 2015, w e l l be low the 
MDG o f universal l i teracy . 

Goal 3: Promote gender equality and empower women 

E l im ina te gender d ispa r i ty in p r im a r y and secondary education preferably by 2005 and in a l l 
levels of education no la te r than 2015. The parity between boys and girls in p r ima ry education 
by 2005 w i l l no t be achieved. The g i r l -boy ra t io has moved f r o m 0.62 in 1990 to 0.76 in 2003. At 
the current pace, i t w o u l d take another nine years (or until 2012) to achieve the target o f gender 
equa l i ty in p r ima ry education. 

Goal 4: Reduce child mortality 

Reduce by two- th irds the under-Jive mo r ta l i ty ra te . 
In fan t and under- f ive mo r ta l i ty rates

pe r 100,000 l i v e births in 1993 to 484 in 1998. I f this trend continues at i t s c u r r e n t pace, the rate 
w i l l be 283 in 2015, w e l l be low the MDG set fo r Burk ina , wh ich i s 142 deaths per 100,000 l i v e 
births. 

P ropo r t ion of b ir ths attended by sk i l led health personnel. Only 35 percent o f births were assisted 
by tra ined med ica l personnel in 2003. Further reductions in maternal mo r ta l i ty w i l l requ ire 
strengthening t h e qua l i ty and coverage o f maternal care services at a l l leve ls (community, c l in ic ,

Summary o f Report 

1. 

This C A S Comp le t ion Repor t (CASCR) aims t o assess the effectiveness o f the W o r l d Bank ’s 
Coun t ry Assistance Strategy for Bu rk ina Faso (CAS) cover ing the FY00-03 per iod . The C A S was 
designed to support the implementation o f the Pover ty Reduc t ion Strategy Paper (PRSP) approved in 
2000. A Coun t ry Assistance Strategy Progress Repor t (CASPR) was prepared in April 8,2003. I t ou t l ined 
an extension o f the Bank’s CAS to cover the pe r iod until the Pover ty Reduc t ion Strategy Paper (PRSP) 
was updated (adopted by the Counc i l o f M in is te rs o n October 27,2004). The CASPR also con f i rmed that 
the Bank ’s support t o Bu rk ina Faso wou ld continue through a selection o f lending instruments inc lud ing 
PRSC, Commun i ty D r i v e n Development operations (CDD), and other trad i t iona l infrastructure 
investment operations. This repor t therefore w i l l cover the pe r iod FYO1- f i r s t h a l f o f FY05 . I t s findings 
w i l l con tr ibu te t o the new CAS in preparation. The nex t C A S w i l l f o l l ow closely the “second generation” 
PRSP. 

2. 
The progress achieved on imp lemen t ing the CAS has been satisfactory. T h e pover ty headcount 
dec l ined by about 8 percentage po in ts b e tw e e n 1998 and 2003. Bu rk ina Faso has sa t is fac tor i ly 
imp lemen ted fou r PRSCs and four PRGF-supported programs associated with the conduct o f sound 
macroeconomic po l ic ies and s ign i f ican t structural re forms . T h e rea l GDP g row th rate increased t o more 
than 5 percent o n average during 2003-2004 f r om 4.7 percent during 1996-2002. The performance was 
achieved despite three drought years in 1998, 2000 and 2002, and t e rm s o f trades shocks in 2000, 2002 
and 2004. I n f l a t i o n has remained low . F isca l p o l i c y imp roved generally, with the ove ra l l f isca l de f ic i t 
contained. M a j o r structural re forms have been carr ied out, inc lud ing in the areas o f pr ice , trade 
l ibera l iza t ion , pub l ic finance management and governance. 

3. 
The CASCR concludes that the Bank ’s coun try strategy re f lec ted a good understanding o f the 
na t iona l challenges, and was relevant to and a l igned with the Government’s long- term development goals 
as spelled ou t in the PRSP. The performance o f the Government and the Bank during the C A S 
imp lemen ta t ion i s considered satisfactory, and the de l ive ry o f the AAA and the po r t fo l io performance 
good. The B a n k assisted the coun try in imp lemen t ing k e y re fo rms in the cotton, water, transport, pub l ic 
finance management sectors through i t s programma t ic lending, ongo ing projects and key ana ly t ica l wo rk . 
S ign i f ican t progress towards achieving the C A S outcomes has been made while more sustained e f fo r ts are 
needed in order to attain the MDG goals and to g ive better access to social services, especially in the 
education sector where, despite s ign i f ican t progress, i l l i te racy rates are among the highest in the Wo r ld . 
Diversifying the economy, imp rov ing investment climate, reg iona l integration, social expenses e f f ic iency 
and donor coordination, accelerating decentralization and deconcentration, and strengthening na t iona l 
capacity to execute, mon i to r and evaluate the rev ised PRSP are k e y challenges ahead in order t o further 
stimulate growth, improve the social we l l -be ing o f the popu la t ion , and ensure an environment conduc ive 
fo r sustainability.

I. The Burkinab& Context and Longer-Term National Development Goals 

4. 
Bu rk ina Faso's PRSP comprised four strategic p i l lars : (i) accelerating broad-based growth, 
(ii) p romo t ing access to social services fo r the poor, (iii) increasing employment and income-generating 
ac t iv i t ies fo r the poo r (p r ima r i ly in the ru ra l sector); and (iv) p romo t ing good governance. 

5. 
The coun try made good progress in imp lemen t ing the PRSP", wh ich has led to: (i) a f i r s t series 
o f three pover ty reduc t ion support credits (PRSC), the approval o f the fou r th one and the preparation o f a 
fifth one in the second se r ies o f PRSC, and (ii) the IMF support under the fou r th successive p rog ram 
supported by an arrangement under the Pover ty Reduc t ion and G r ow t h F a c i l i t y (PRGF). The IMF 
completed i ts f i r s t review in M a r c h 2004, second and third reviews under the p rog ram fo r 2003-2006 in 
February 2005 with satisfactory outcomes. 

6. 
Bu rk ina Faso reached the comp le t ion po in ts under the o r ig ina l and enhanced H P C In i t ia t ives in 
June 2000 and April 2002 respectively, and was granted debt r e l i e f to ta l ing more than US$550 m i l l i o n in 
net-present value terms, inc lud ing a topping-up at comp le t ion po in t .

Bu rk ina Faso's economy i s characterized by i t s l o w per-capita income o f about $350 in 2004, 
very limited human capital, high vu lne rab i l i ty to external shocks ow ing to i t s dependency o n co t ton 
production, strong dependence o n external aid, and l im i t e d resource base. As a result, progress in 
imp rov ing l i v i n g conditions has been s low though steady, and Bu rk ina Faso continues to rank ve ry l o w 
o n the United Na t ions Development Program (UNDP) Human Deve lopmen t Index . 
8. 
Bu rk ina Faso ma in ta ined a good macroeconomic framework and economic g row th rates in 200 1 - 
2004 with an average o f 6.2 percent. G row th was l e d by the agriculture sector, as exemp l i f ied by the 
development o f co t ton p roduc t ion and a reco rd cereal produc t ion in 2003. Desp i te huge w o r l d pr ice 
fluctuations, there has been a strong and steady g row th in the co t ton sector, m a i n l y a t tr ibu ted t o good 
management o f the sub-sector ( inc lud ing co l labora t ion with producers' organizations and incentives 
structure fo r farmers), and good progress o n the re fo rm agenda (pr iva t iza t ion and opening to 
competition). However, g row th in agriculture cou ld have been even better with more support to non 
t rad i t iona l supply chains and to d ive rs i f ica t ion to enable the p r iva te sector t o seize marke t opportunities in 
sub-regional and in terna t iona l trade.

The country made good progress on imp rov ing pub l ic finance management through on-go ing 
e f for ts to increase transparency and accoun tab i l i ty in p o l i c y imp lemen ta t ion and budget management. I t 
managed t o m i t iga te the negative impac t o f the C6te d ' Ivo i re cr is is o n growth, emp loymen t and in f la t ion 
thanks to supportive Government po l ic ies : Government's subsidy t o o f fse t h ighe r transport pr ices for 
fertilizers, l ibera l iza t ion o f road transports and the rev iva l o f trad i t iona l trade links with Ghana and Togo, 
au thor iza t ion to a l low fore ign trucks to p i c k up goods in Bu rk ina Faso. I n f l a t i o n rema ined subdued in the 
C A S period, w i t h an average o f 2 percent.

Country Assistance Strategy Progress and Outcomes 

10. 
The four p i l la rs o f the Bank 's strategy were t o support: (i) accelerated g row th strategy and closer 
in tegra t ion in to the reg iona l economy; (ii) access o f the poo r t o basic soc ia l services, (iii) opportunities 
for employment and income-generating ac t iv i t ies fo r the poor; and (iv) good gov.emance and ins t i tu t iona l 
reforms. The approach ou t l ined in the C A S consisted of: (i) incorpora t ing the r e s u l t s o f in tens ive 

' A s ou t l ined in the 2001-2004 PRSP-PR and the ir Jo in t S t a f f Assessments, and the 2003 CAS Progress repor t .

ana ly t ica l w o r k a n d discussions with the Burkinabi. authorities o n the causes o f pover ty and the 
challenges o f h ighe r sustainable growth; (ii) focusing o n the areas c r i t ica l fo r the poo r (education, health, 
water supply, r u r a l development) and o n increasing their access t o basic pub l ic services; (iii) addressing 
key cross-cutting issues o f capacity building, gender, decentralization, and the environment; and 
( iv ) recommend ing a progressive shift f rom pro jec t support towards p rog ram support to fur ther the 
strategic, efficient, and equitable u s e o f pub l ic resources. Bank in terven t ion in support o f the PRSP was 
in tended t o be selective and complementary o f activities supported by other donors. 

1 1. 
The C A S was based o n a scenario o f moderate g row th - average rea l GDP g row th o f 4.5 percent 
pe r annum over the pe r iod o f 2000-2005, (leading to a decrease o f on ly 16 percent o f pove r ty - about 7 
percentage points). In contrast, the PRSP projected rea l GDP g row th rate o f over 7 percent a year in 
2001-2003 (unprecedented and ove r ly ambitious) due to the n e e d fo r an ambitious r e f o rm agenda. 

12. 
T o assess i t s effectiveness, the CAS iden t i f ied 14 key mon i to r ing indicators (see Table 1 in the 
Annex section) w i th n o quan t i f ica t ion defined but with specific mon i to r ing instrument fo r each key 
mon i to r ing ind ica tor . A few specific performance indicators were also spelled ou t in the C A S ma t r ix (see 
Table 2 in the Annex section). Only one had a baseline and target ind ica tor ( fa rm mechanization rate) but 
the latter was fo r 2010. Also, indicators to go f r om one lending scenario t o another were n o t de f ined 
quan t i ta t ive ly but rather qua l i ta t ive ly . The CASPR did n o t fine-tune the indicators to incorporate 
quantitative, outcome- and results-oriented benchmarks to better mon i to r the C A S outcomes but instead 
reported o n key Govemment’s PRSP and economic indicators.

13. 
This ob jec t ive was to be attained by ma in ta in ing a stable macroeconomic framework, l ibe ra l iz ing 
the economy, increas ing i t s competitiveness through d ive rs i f ica t ion and reduced factor costs, supporting 
the g row th po ten t ia l o f some specific produc t ive sectors (agricultureAivestock, water, urban, mining, 
energy, transporthnfrastructure). The C A S objectives were re levan t and w e l l a l igned with the PRSP. 

14. 
These pre-requisites were mos t ly achieved, with the excep t ion o f the d ivers i f ica t ion o f the 
economy. 
In v i ew o f the coun try ’s economic performance and good track reco rd o f re fo rm 
implementation, this p i l la r ’s ob jec t ive i s considered achieved. 

15. 
The 2000 CAS had a specific goal o f helping the Government reduce the pove r ty headcount ra t io 
by at least 2 percentage po in ts per year during the pe r iod 2000-2003. The recen t ly completed Pover ty 
Assessment estimated that Bu r luna Faso has experienced substantial reduc t ion in poverty, w i thou t 
s ign i f ican t changes in inequa l i ty . The pove r ty headcount wen t d ow n f r om an estimated 54.6 percent in 
1998 to 46.4 percent in 2003, and b o t h the pover ty gap and i t s sever i ty declined. T h e reduc t ion in pove r ty 
was more pronounced in r u r a l areas, where the headcount f e l l f r om 61.1 percent in 1998 t o 52.4 percent 
in 2003 wh i le i t was substantially smaller than in urban areas ( f rom 22.4 to 19.2 percent) g iven the large 
increase in cereal and co t ton p roduc t ion since 1998 w h i c h was a year o f severe drought. 
Inequa l i ty 
rema ined unchanged and h igher in urban than ru ra l areas. 

16. 
Bu rk ina has achieved a stable macroeconomic env ironmen t with l o w in f la t ion despite the external 
shocks faced by the coun try during the CAS imp lemen ta t ion (drought and erratic ra in fa l l , Cbte d ’ Ivo ire 
crisis, f a l l in in terna t iona l co t ton pr ices and increase in o i l prices, locus t invasion, exchange rate 
f luc tua t ion b e tw e e n the do l la r and the Euro, l o w p red ic tab i l i ty o f donor resources), the coun try per formed 
we l l in the face o f adverse external shocks through strong ownersh ip o f the med ium- term re fo rm program, 
sound f isca l po l icy through adjustment o f non -p r io r i ty expenditure, and mo re liberalization, no tab ly in 
the transport sector and the open ing up o f new trade routes in add i t ion to Cb te d ’ Ivo ire .

17. 
Average economic g row th during the C A S pe r iod i s 6.2 percent and average in f la t ion was 
contained at 2.1 percent. GDP g row th in the pe r iod was led by the agriculture sector, no tab ly co t ton and 
cereal produc t ion . F isca l deficits rema in consistent w i t h available concessional ex tema l assistance. 
B u r k i n a Faso reached the comp le t ion po in t under the enhanced H I PC in i t ia t ive in April 2004. The 
pruden t f isca l and monetary po l ic ies have helped ma in ta in l o w in f la t ion , thus m i t iga t ing the impac t o n the 
rea l e f fec t ive exchange rate o f the appreciation o f the C F A F against the U S dollar. Overa l l , Bu rk ina was 
s t i l l able to ma in ta in most of the competitiveness gained with the devaluation o f the C F A F in 1994. The 
curren t account de f ic i t , exc lud ing grants, imp roved from 13.3 percent o f GDP in 2001 to 11.6 percent in 
2004. 

18. 

Po l icv imp lemen ta t ion record under the PRSCs has been good and gradua l ly improved . During 
200 1-2003, d i f f i c u l t external circumstances, trade shocks, weak revenue performance and the late 
disbursement o f donor assistance in 2001 presented obstacles to a smooth imp lemen ta t ion o f the PRSP. 
F ina l ly , Bu rk ina Faso s u f f e r s f r om l im i t e d capacity in the absorption o f resources and mon i to r ing their 
use and effectiveness. The CAS pe r iod saw the imp lemen ta t ion o f the u t i l i t ies r e f o rm p rog ram with 
progress in energy (electricity, ru ra l e lec tr i f ica t ion and o i l and gas), water, telecommunications, 
transportation, and microfinance, a l though with delays in telecommunications and energy sectors, and in 
p r iva t iza t ion and e f for ts to create a favorable environment fo r development o f the p r iva te sector. 

19. 
On the p r iva t iza t ion agenda, 44 state enterprises were l iqu ida ted o r so ld by end o f 2004. The 
ongo ing p r iva t iza t ion program, wh ich was adopted in 2001, consists o f 21 pub l ic enterprises, inc lud ing 
ma jo r u t i l i t ies . The Government developed a telecommunications sector strategy, adopted a n ew 
regu la tory framework, and opened the sector t o compe t i t ion by issuing two ce l lu lar licenses. As a result, 
telecommunications costs have been reduced over the past years. A sustained e f fo r t was deployed to 
build the capacity o f the regu la tory agency, w h i c h i s n o w considered as one o f the best per formers in sub- 
Saharan A f r ica . The p r iva t iza t ion o f O N A T E L (Ofice National des Tklkcommunications) reached the 
p o i n t o f sale, but the market response has been disappointing. In some instances however, re forms were 
subject to delays. 
I t took a l o n g t ime fo r the Government t o rev is i t the p r iva t iza t ion strategy fo r 
O N A T E L so as to re-launch the p r iva t iza t ion process o n the basis o f a 51 percent sale to a strategic 
investor. Also, the res truc tur ing o f the e lec tr ic i ty sector ( inc lud ing the p r iva t iza t ion o f the e lec tr ic i ty 
company SONABEL) required a longer t ime frame than expected to develop and put in place the 
regu la tory framework . The co t ton sector was opened to the p r iva te investors in 2004 with the sale o f pa r t 
o f SOF ITEX ’S assets to two new strategic p r iva te investors and the creation o f two ginning companies 
(FASOCOTON and SOCOMA) , wh ich i s pa r t o f the p r iva t iza t iod l ibe ra l iza t ion agenda in the co t ton 
sector. The sector o f the re ta i l d is t r ibu t ion o f pe tro leum was opened t o two new operators, and i t has 
become more competitive. There i s a need fo r greater h igh - leve l comm i tmen t t o imp lemen t the 
p r iva t iza t ion p rog ram on time, pa r t icu la r ly the u t i l i t i e s sector in order to boost the coun try ’s 
competitiveness. 

20. 
The p r iva t iza t ion agenda was supported by the PRSC p rog ram and the Competitiveness and 
Enterprise Development project, approved in FY03, w h i c h built o n the 2001 comprehensive analysis o f 
competitiveness and long- term g row th in Bu rk ina Faso. In add i t ion to the p r iva t iza t ion and utility r e f o rm 
agenda, the pro jec t prov ides support for : (i) imp rov ing the business environment, inc lud ing r e d tape 
a l lev ia t ion , lega l re fo rm and arbitration; (ii) building capacity o f regu la tory agencies and other ins t i tu t ions 
invo lved in pr iva te sector development; (iii) im p r o v i n g enterprise performance through business 
development services channeled through the “Maison de 1 ’Entreprise”; and (iv) strengthening 
m i c r o financ e ins t i tu t ions . 
21. 
V is-a-v is o f reg iona l integration, Bu rk ina Faso has had a good reco rd in comp ly ing with the

Faso i s invo lved inc lude : (i) trade and transport fac i l i ta t ion along the Abidjan-Ouagadougou-Niamey and 
the Lome-Ouagadougou corridors; (ii) harmonization of the telecommunications regu la tory framework; 
(iii) reg iona l a i r transport safety oversight; and (iv) reg iona l power market. 

22. 
W h i l e the Bank’s in terven t ion in the f inanc ia l sector was limited during the C A S pe r iod s ince the 
sector had been assessed as sound by the Bank’s team, assistance has b e e n p rov ided in the fo rm o f 
support to m icro- f inance through the ongo ing P ACD E project, and through two reg iona l activities: (i) a 
reg iona l pro jec t w h i c h financed the modern iza t ion o f the reg iona l payment system l e d by B C E A O with 
the establishment and operationalization o f a rea l time gross settlement system fo r large payments, and 
the establishment o f an electronic c lear ing system fo r mass payment, expected to become operational by 
end o f 2005; and (ii) a 408 m i l l i o n dollars package, inc lud ing an IDA l i n e o f credit, technical assistance 
f r om IDA, AFD and C ID A , and pa r t ia l guarantees f r om IDA, MIGA and AFD t o support the 
modern iza t ion and development o f reg iona l capital markets led by BOAD, and the reg iona l regulator o f 
cap i ta l markets (CREPMF). The payment system pro jec t w i l l have achieved mos t o f i t s objectives when i t 
closes in the nex t f ew months. 

23. 
L i t t l e progress was made o n economic d ivers i f ica t ion . The economy i s s t i l l ve ry dependent o n 
co t ton as the m a i n export crop and therefore highly vulnerable to t e rm s o f trade shocks. I t has n o t 
attracted the necessary leve l o f fore ign d irec t investment to increase emp loymen t and incomes, ow ing t o 
poo r economic infi-astructure and high transaction and input costs, l o w labo r p roduc t iv i ty , the l im i t e d size 
o f the modem economy and impor tan t ins t i tu t iona l weaknesses. The 200 1 Competitiveness and 
Econom ic G r ow t h repor t p rov ided a good analysis o f constraints to g row th and economic d ivers i f ica t ion 
and some o f i t s recommendations were implemented under the Competitiveness and Enterprise 
Deve lopmen t pro jec t in order to reduce factor costs and to imp rove governance but fur ther e f for ts are 
needed. 

24. 
Since produc t ion costs o f the e n e rm continue to impac t nega t ive ly o n economic competitiveness, 
the Government sought to increase the competitiveness o f the economy by reduc ing p roduc t ion factor 
costs through the p rov is ion and ra t iona l use o f electricity, and to support the improvemen t o f the g row th 
po ten t ia l o f t h e ene rgy sector, by encouraging and fac i l i ta t ing active pa r t ic ipa t ion o f communities, non- 
governmental organizations, and the pr iva te sector in mee t ing energy demand, especially in ru ra l and 
per i-urban areas. The CAS ob jec t ive was relevant to the Government’s ob jec t ive since i t developed a 
two-pronged approach to imp lemen t least-cost energy investment options in rural, per i-urban and urban 
areas, together with adequate l ibe ra l iza t ion and regulation. The Government o n l y recen t ly se t the pa th fo r 
pub l ic-pr iva te partnership in the powe r sector, and in the energy sector in general, by sw i tch ing f r om 
favo r ing high-cost to least cost investment options, inc lud ing in terconnec t ion with ne ighbo r ing countries, 
and an increased comm i tmen t to imp rove the sector p o l i c y and regu la tory framework . This constituted a 
ma jo r achievement fo r pr iva te sector and donor par t ic ipa t ion . 

25. With the a im of reduc ing the input costs to industry, the in terconnec t ion o f the c i t y o f Bobo - 
D iou lasso with the e lec tr ica l powe r grid o f Cote d ’ Ivo ire became operational in April 2001 t o reduce the 
input costs to industry. This in terconnec t ion w i l l be extended through Ouagadougou under the recently- 
approved Power Sector Deve lopmen t Pro jec t (PDSP). The cr is is in ne ighbo r ing CGte d ’ Ivo i re strained the 
Bu rk inabk economy through, among others, frequent c u t o f f o f the supply l ines and h ighe r transportation 
costs. Because impo r t ing powe r f r om CGte d ’ Ivo i re i s the m a i n e lemen t o f the Government strategy fo r 
reduc ing e lec tr ic i ty costs, Bu rk ina i s highly vulnerable to i t s external environment. In the ru ra l areas, 
many ac t iv i t ies are ongo ing in the area o f sustainable energy with community-based forest management, 
p romo t ion o f carbonization techno logy and p romo t ion o f pho tovo l ta ic solar systems. These ac t iv i t ies w i l l 
be scaled-up under the up-com ing Energy Access pro jec t .

26. 
The m a i n ob jec t ive in the transport sector was to increase people and goods m o b i l i t y in a socially, 
f inanc ia l ly and econom ica l ly sustainable manner, thus ensuring economic v iab i l i ty o f the coun try ’s urban 
and ru ra l areas and imp rov ing people’s living conditions. The Bank’s assistance has b e e n highly re levan t 
to Burk ina ’s deve lopmen t strategy o f economic re fo rm programs and i t s emphasis o n reduc ing subsidies, 
increasing invo lvemen t o f the pr iva te sector in the p rov is ion o f services, and imp rov ing the e f f ic iency and 
qua l i ty o f such services. 

27. 
W h i l e the closed PASECT in i t ia l ly intended to restructure rather than pr iva t ize transport state- 
owned-enterprises, the Bank mod i f ied the ra i lways and road passenger transport sub-components 
f o l l ow i n g the Government’s decision to pr iva t ize these infrastructure’s sub-sectors. At p ro jec t closure, 
the ins t i tu t iona l objectives o f the pro jec t were surpassed, and p r iva t iza t ion was accomplished fo r several 
ac t iv i t ies . OED con f irmed that the pro jec t had a s ign i f ican t impac t o n the p romo t ion o f pr iva te sector 
pa r t ic ipa t ion in the transport sector. 

28. 
The fo l low -up Transport sector pro jec t i s under imp lemen ta t ion since mid-2003, with an 
ob jec t ive to decrease transport costs, increase the management capacity o f the Transport Ministry and 
imp rove road ne two rk conditions and popu la t ion mob i l i ty . 
I t s success w i l l be assessed against a 10 
percent decrease in non-urban road transport fares, a 20 percent decrease o f average access time to hea l th 
care fac i l i t ies and p r ima ry schools in pro jec t in terven t ion areas (MDG indicators), and a 100 percent 
improvemen t o f c lass i f ied road ne two rk condition. 

29. 
The Ouagadougou Water supply project, w h i c h i s pa r t o f a US$206 m i l l i o n program supported by 
11 donors, has been the m a i n veh ic le for the Bank’s support t o urban water supplv and sanitation. I t aims 
at supporting the connection o f poor households to the water supply network, increasing access t o 
adequate and re l iab le potable water supply in Ouagadougou, and strengthening the management o f the 
urban water sector. 
Imp lemen ta t ion o f the ove ra l l p rog ram i s g loba l ly satisfactory. Access t o water 
connections and ava i lab i l i ty o f water has increased since the beg inn ing o f the pro jec t . In the Capital, 
there has been an increase: (i) o f 19 percen t in the sale o f po tab le water - f r om 15 m i l l i o n m3 in 200 1 t o 
17.8 m i l l i o n in 2004; (ii) o f 20 pe rcen t in the number o f ac t ive water connections - f r om 36,800 in 2001

500,000 f r om 2001 to 2004. As a resu l t , about 40 percent o f the Ouagadougou popu la t ion i s connected to 
the water supply ne two rk and about 87 percent has access t o water services. Built-in arrangements have 
been developed to bene f i t the poo r as costs o f connection to the water d is t r ibu t ion system w i l l be la rge ly 
reduced. 

30. 
In addition, the f inanc ia l situation o f the na t iona l water and sanitation u t i l i t y (ONEA) has 
imp roved dras t ica l ly and the management o f ONEA has substantially improved, and the urban water 
sector has reached f inanc ia l equ i l ib r ium with revenues generated by ONEA cover ing operating and debt 
serv ic ing costs w i thou t requiring Government subsidies. E f f ic iency improvemen ts have been no t iced as 
operations and wo rk ing ra t ios are fo l low ing pos i t ive trends, as well as imp roved commerc ia l and 
operation indicators. The co l lec t ion ra t io fo r p r iva te customers’ water bills i s around 90 percent, 
unaccounted water less than 20 percent and the cost o f a no rma l connec t ion to the water supply ne two rk 
has greatly been reduced. Moreover , the in t roduc t ion o f the service contract managed by an in tema t iona l 
j o i n t ven ture o f a reputable water operator i s a f i r s t s tep towards a more deliberate pr iva te sector 
par t ic ipa t ion in managing water supply services in B u r k i n a Faso. I t i s expected that the pro jec t w i l l he lp

der ive a l i v e l i h o o d f r om artisanal mining. The closed m in ing capacity building p ro jec t (PRECAGEME) 
supported the Government’s e f for ts to in te rvene directly in this sub-sector to strengthen the mining sector 
fi-amework and to p rov ide training, awareness, and sensitization as to the environmental, safety and hea l th 
hazards, and t o increase the p roduc t iv i ty o f artisanal miners. The results achieved by the Bank’s w o r k in 
the sector are good. Reforms o f legislation, taxation, and ins t i tu t iona l strengthening were undertaken by 
the project, a t trac t ing new pr iva te sector investments to the sector. T o that effect, t w o o r three new 
indus t r ia l m ines w i l l open over the nex t tw o years. Also, p rov is ion o f essential services was made under 
the p ro jec t (power, water and transport infrastructure in the ru ra l areas). This preempts a l i k e l y 
sus ta inab i l i ty o f the results, i f international conditions are favorable and the sector and i t s revenues are 
adequately managed. 

32. 
Progress o n the U rban Env ironmen t Project and i t s supplemental cred i t has been satisfactory. 
M o s t o f the phys ica l works are completed or about to be completed, and bene f i ted the popu la t ion by 
p reven t ing flooding, limiting so i l erosion and urban degradation and suppressing breed ing grounds fo r 
mosquitoes. Cons truc t ion o f urban access roads has also fac i l i ta ted access t o poor neighborhoods and 
reduced trave l t imes . Pr imary schools in Ouagadougou are n o w equipped with appropriate sanitary 
fac i l i t ies and Ouagadougou i s the on ly cap i ta l c i t y in western A f i i c a in w h i c h some p r ima ry schools have 
wo rk ing sanitary fac i l i t ies financed with loca l ly generated resources. 

33. 
Bank instruments - This p i l l a r was supported by the PRSC program, selected investment 
operations in the mining, private, transport and energy sectors as described above, and AAA to p rov ide 
support t o develop better economic mode l ing too ls and t o prepare the PRSP rev is ion with economic 
s imu la t ions wo rk . The Bank also conducted a rev iew o f the regu la tory framework in infrastructure, and 
con tr ibu ted to sectoral PERs and to MTEF. T o s treng then capacity building, t ra in ing was p rov ided to 
members o f the Burkinabt: PRSP team in pove r ty analysis. The ru ra l po r t fo l io has also con tr ibu ted to this 
objective. This mix o f instruments has p roven e f fec t ive to achieve the p i l la r ’s objectives. 

34. 
Performance - i t has been satisfactory ove ra l l , with the exception o f the energy sector where the 
performance o f the Bank has been m ixed . In the water sector fo r example, the B a n k i s the lead agency 
mandated by other donors to coordinate dialogue with the Government and large f inanc ier o f the water 
supply ne two rk in Ouagadougou. I t has been ins trumen ta l in revamp ing the operational and commerc ia l 
efficiency 
o f ONEA, ensuring imp lemen ta t ion o f an e f fec t ive t a r i f f po l icy , and spearheading the 
development o f pr iva te sector invo lvemen t by in t roduc ing a service contract. In contrast, in the energy 
sector, the Bank wh ich re-engaged the dialogue in 1999 after more than 20 years o f absence, experienced 
d i f f icu l t ies in building momen tum around a cohesive energy p o l i c y and investment p rog ram among 
donors and the Government, and over the sequencing o f r e f o rm and investment. However , f o l l ow i n g a 
change in team leadership, there was a swift improvemen t in B a n k performance, as ind ica ted above by the 
results achieved over a one-year pe r iod and the recent approva l o f the PDSP. The Bank ’s invo lvemen t 
was c r i t ica l fo r max im iz ing development impac t by lead ing donor coord ina t ion in a p rog ram o f p o l i c y 
and regu la tory re forms and ensuring a coherent approach t o sector investments. The B a n k also brough t 
i t s know ledge and experience to the sector re fo rms and to the p r iva t iza t ion process. 

Supporting access o f the poor t o basic social services (pillar 2) 

35. 
This h igher l e v e l objective was supported by p romo t ing access to the poo r t o education, hea l th 
services and water. In the social sectors, the B a n k a imed at imp rov ing : (i) the equity and e f f ic iency o f 
pub l ic expenditure fo r social services, through p o l i c y d ia logue and pub l ic expenditure reviews; and 
(ii) access and e f f ic iency o f social services. 

36. 
In the education sector, the C A S outcomes were relevant t o the Government’s ma jo r PRSP 
objectives to promote access to education services to the poo r by increas ing coverage o f basic education 

- 80 - 

and imp rov ing i t s quality, establishing a balance in the education system t o respond to the needs o f the 
economy, and deve lop ing a l i teracy program o f good qua l i ty to adults, especially women. 

37. 
The Bank’s support to education focused on helping raise enro l lmen t and comp le t ion rates, 
leam ing outcomes and l i teracy rates. At the p r ima ry education leve l , B a n k support was geared towards 
imp lemen t ing qua l i ty cost-effective programs to reach desired learn ing outcomes at a f fordab le prices fo r 
the poor . This invo lved targeting women and the poor in the provinces with the least coverage. The Bank 
also supported the imp lemen ta t ion o f the ten-year basic education development p lan (PDDEB) wh ich l a i d 
ou t the re fo rm o f education po l ic ies targeted at the reorganization and f inanc ing o f basic education, 
ins t i tu t iona l re form , improvemen t in the e f f ic iency and effectiveness o f pub l ic expenditure o n education. 
The P D D E B started in 2002. 

38. 
Steady progress has been made bu t challenges remain. Gross enro l lmen t rates increased f r om 41.7 
percent in 1999-2000 to 52.3 percent in 2003-3004 and f r om 36.2 percent t o 46 percent fo r girls. In the 
20 mos t disadvantaged provinces, enro l lmen t rates increased f r om 27.8 to 36.2 percent. The objectives t o 
increase education’s share o f public expenditures and to benefit the poorest and most vulnerable groups 
have been fu l ly met: Government and H l P C funds have been channeled spec i f ica l ly to the 20 p r io r i ty 
provinces with the lowest access to education services and funding levels have always been preserved. 
Also, the a im to establish permanent l i teracy and tra in ing cen ters o r non- forma l basic educational centers, 
and projects directed at women was fu l ly met: L i teracy tra in ing centers have been set up in ru ra l areas, 
par t icu lar ly in the 20 p r io r i ty provinces, and these centers also target women specifically. T h e number o f 
centers offering i n i t i a l literacy programs increased dramatically f r om 984 centers in 2003 t o 1793 in 2004 
and the number o f those registered in the in i t ia l literacy tra in ing program increased f r om 129,497 in 2001 to 
182,323 in 2004. In the 20 p r io r i ty provinces, the number increased by 46 percent, and the number o f 
women who registered in the i n i t i a l l i teracy program also increased by 43 percent, constituting 52 percent o f 
the to ta l registered in the program. L i teracy tra in ing has been incorporated in a wider set o f activities and 
services (such as health, education, credit, and extension services) through the PNG T project. Acco rd ing to 
household survey, l i te racy rates increased f r om 18.4 to 21.8 percent be tween 1998 and 2003. Even i f the 
decentralized hiring o f pr imary school teachers i s no t effective yet, progress was made as scheduled. 

39. 
However, accord ing to the PER, challenges rema in in increasing qua l i ty and re ten t ion (60 percent 
- 49 percent in r u r a l areas and 4 1 percent fo r ru ra l g i r ls ) . Unit costs in p r ima ry education rema in high 
(0.24 times per capita GDP) as a resu l t o f high repe t i t ion rates w h i c h i s over 15 percent, and are ma in ly 
the reflect o f supply constraints at the secondary level. Also, the implementation o f the ins t i tu t iona l 
reforms within the MEBA and increased e f f ic iency in the use o f pub l ic funds in education goals have no t 
been met, ma in ly due to insu f f ic ien t po l i t ica l commitment to put in place these reforms. The share o f budget 
to the mos t decentralized department has con t inued but with poo r execu t ion rate. 

40. 
The Basic Educa t ion Sector Project, approved in FY02 , i s the core element o f the Bank ’s support 
to the PDDEB . The qua l i ty at en try fo r the p ro jec t was judged ove ra l l satisfactory and i t s strategic 
relevance highly satisfactory. However , imp lemen ta t ion arrangements were ra ted ma rg ina l ly satisfactory. 
Given the weak 
ins t i tu t iona l capacity and organization o f the Ministry o f Bas ic Education, 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the very amb i t ious in fras truc ture encounters l o n g delays. The Government i s n o w 
comm i t ted to get the pro jec t back o n track. A res truc tur ing i s p lanned after the m id-year rev iew o f the 
p ro jec t to address the c u r r e n t imp lemen ta t ion constraints. 

41. 
The Post-Primary Educa t ion Pro jec t closed in April 2004, with a satisfactory outcome. The 
trans i t ion rate f r om p r ima ry to secondary education increased f r om 27 percent in 1994 t o 4 0 percent in 
2002, surpassing the p ro jec t target o f 35 percent. The number o f students at the secondary leve l increased 
by 60 percent, surpassing the target o f a 42 percent increase. In particular, the p ropo r t ion o f girls enro l led 
at secondary leve l reached the target o f 4 0 percent.

In the hea l th sector, the Bank aimed at imp rov ing access and e f f ic iency o f social services through 
reduced costs f o r p r ima ry hea l th services, ensuring ava i lab i l i ty o f essential drugs, p romo t ing ins t i tu t iona l 
reforms, and strengthening commun i ty par t ic ipa t ion and approaches, inc lud ing commun i ty management 
committees (COGES). The CAS outcomes were relevant to the Government’s ma jo r PRSP objectives 
w h i c h granted top p r i o r i t y to addressing the health problems o f the poorest segments o f the population, t o 
mak ing essential hea l th care affordable and to supporting the par t ic ipa t ion o f users and communities in 
the development and management o f health care ac t iv i t ies (e.g. develop community-based strategies, 
s t reng then the powers o f loca l management committees). The na t iona l hea l th development strategy, 
adopted in 2001, guides hea l th sector policies. 

43. 
Overa l l , expected resu l ts were achieved although uneven . Addressing hea l th problems o f the 
poorest segments o f the popu la t ion and mak ing essential hea l th care affordable were fu l ly met while 
suppor t ing the pa r t ic ipa t ion o f users and communities in the development and management o f hea l th care 
was o n l y p a r t i a l l y met. M o s t key hea l th and service coverage indicators imp roved from 1999 to 2003: 
(i) c h i l d mo r ta l i ty declined f r om 219 to 184 per thousand; (ii) use o f key preventative and curative 
s e r v i c e s increased, inc lud ing c h i l d vaccination coverage (BCG 72 percent to 8 lpercen t , and DTCP3 f r om 
4 1 percent to 57 percent), antenatal care (CPN2 f r om 55 percent to 64 percent), and average number o f 
n ew contacts pe r year (0.2 in 2000 to 0.32 in 2003); and (iii) the percentage o f men using condoms during 
the ir mos t recent high-risk sexual contact increased f r om 59 percent to 69 percent f r om 1999 to 2003, and 
the HIV prevalence rate among young women (aged 15-24) attending urban antenatal c l in ics declined 
f rom 3.9 percent in 2001 t o 1.9 percent in 2003. 

44. 
However , c h i l d ma lnu t r i t ion did n o t improve, with over a third o f ch i ldren (under 5) 
malnourished. A lso , substantial progress was made in mak ing basic curative and preven t ive hea l th 
service more affordable. Through HLPC support and the PRSCs, c h i l d vacc ina t ion was declared free o f 
charge in 2002, and in 2003 prenatal care became free. The Government reduced the p r ice marg ins o n 
essential drugs, w h i c h con tr ibu ted to a 20 percent decline o n average. F inanc ia l barriers have n o t been 
en t ire ly eliminated, and enforcement o f the new pr ice structures needs to be further strengthened, but 
these a l l con tr ibu ted to increased u s e o f service by the poor . 

45. 
T h e Government made l im i t e d progress in imp rov ing t ra in ing o f the management committees fo r 
hea l th centers (COGES) and p i lo t ing loca l hea l th mutuelles (mu tua l insurance). W h i l e s ign i f ican t 
progress was made in mob i l iz ing communities fo r HIV awareness-raising in the 13 o f 45 p i l o t prov inces 
targeted by the MAP project, and in mob i l iz ing commun i t ies and t rad i t iona l leaders fo r vacc ina t ion 
campaigns, commun i ty pa r t ic ipa t ing in hea l th remains re la t ive ly weak, with the COGES ma in ly focused 
o n managing cost recovery funds. The process fo r rev is ing the COGES gu ide l ines has begun, however. 

46. 
As no ted in i t s ICR , the Bank p layed a p ivo ta l r o l e in suppor t ing the development o f hea l th 
d is tr ic ts and in channeling funds d i rec t ly to d is tr ic ts and reg iona l authorities through the Hea l th and 
N u t r i t i o n Project, wh ich closed in September 200 1. The decen tra l iza t ion o f f inanc ia l resources and use o f 
management agreements enhanced ownership and accoun tab i l i ty at a l l leve ls o f the hea l th system. The 
Popu la t ion and A I D S Con t ro l Project, which also closed in September 2001, supported the Government’s 
H N / A I D S na t iona l p rog ram through assisting in ra is ing awareness, strengthening treatment o f 
opportunistic in fec t ions and sexually transmitted infections, and suppor t ing NGOs and associations. The 
HIV/AIDS Disaster Response Pro jec t was approved under the M u l t i -C o u n t r y HN/AIDS Program f o r the 
A f r ica region. I t i s imp lemen ted through the same experienced coord ina t ing unit that managed the la t ter

key activities, tapp ing coun try and sector know ledge and M&E, but some weaknesses in terms o f 
environmental and imp lemen ta t ion arrangements were noted. Desp i te many conditions o f effectiveness,

Na t iona l HIV/AIDS Strategy (2006-20 10). 
Ins trumen ts - Their nature and mix o f the Bank lending has evo lved during the C A S 
imp lemen ta t ion . 
F r om trad i t iona l investment operations, the Bank has sw i tched i t s assistance 
programma t ic budget support and selected investment operations to strengthen the de l ive ry o f social 
services at the loca l level, and the p rov is ion o f water and urban infrastructure services. T h i s evo lu t ion in 
the choice o f instruments has proven effective. The PRSCs have contributed to reduce costs o f social 
services and fac i l i ta ted dialogue o n k e y reforms, even i f imp lemen ta t ion has been slow. But 
complementary e f for ts by Government and other partners were also essential in assuring ava i lab i l i ty o f 
resources fo r service delivery by hea l th districts, pa r t icu la r ly given tha t ava i lab i l i ty and execution 
delegated credits (Government budget) imp roved more s low ly than anticipated. To ta l allocations to hea l th 
and the percent o f the budget go ing to the decentralized leve l have increased since 200 1. 

48. 
The Bank ’s AAA program also con tr ibu ted to the f inanc ing o f s tud ies (Hea l th Status Report, 
P H R D s tud ies under PRSC3-5, Social Pro tec t ion note), and the i s s u e s faced by the soc ia l sectors were 
addressed in the Pover ty Assessment and the Pub l ic Expenditure Reviews. The s tud ies fed the 
Government’s sectoral strategies and the preparation o f the rev ised PRSP. 
Performance - has been moderately sa t is fac toy . 
49. 
In the education sector, there has been a 
s ign i f ican t improvemen t in outcome indicators. The B a n k has p layed a key ro le in c la r i fy ing the ro les 
and respons ib i l i t ies among donors and b e tw e e n the donors and the Government in order to imp rove 
coordination. However, there i s r o om fo r improvemen t fo r a better coord ina t ion among donors vis-&vis 
o f the Government and activities. The B a n k has fa i led to take ear ly ac t ion t o remedy the fac t that 
progress o f the Basic Educa t ion Sector Pro jec t have b e e n measured based on the education p rog ram 
ra ther than o n the specific con t r ibu t ion o f the Project. Also, desp i te technical and f inanc ia l assistance fo r 
the basic education sector, the MEBA has experienced delays in ma jo r ins t i tu t iona l re forms due to the 
l a c k o f a clear decision l i n e w i t h i n the Ministry and lack o f comm i tmen t to take the necessary measures t o 
put in place the requ ired ins t i tu t iona l re forms . The la t ter issue was brough t to the a t ten t ion o f the P r ime 
M i n i s t e r la te 2004 who formed a comm i t tee to identify the constraints and f o l l ow up o n the 
imp lemen ta t ion o f activities. 

50. 

In the hea l th sector, pos i t ive evo lu t ion o f key ind ica tors and a constant constructive dialogue with 
c i v i l society, and partners characterized the Government’s comm i tmen t in this sector. T h e shift f r om 
p ro jec t t o p rog ram support was i n i t i a l l y perce ived by the Ministry o f Hea l th and some partners as 
disengagement, but the Bank ’s strong and con t inued engagement in key p o l i c y issues a f fec t ing the sector 
( f inanc ia l access, budget, human resources, etc.) i s n o w w i d e l y appreciated by Government and partners. 
5 1. 
Sustainability - The imp lemen ta t ion o f P D D E B has p roven d i f f i c u l t because o f lack o f c la r i ty in 
the dec is ion l ine o f MEBA, and high transaction costs due to donor requirements. The Government i s 
comm i t ted to imp lemen t the mechanism t o subsidize schoo l supplies in the 20 prov inces with lowes t 
school enro l lmen t rates and has con t inued to wa ive school fees fo r girls. However, there were delays in 
some areas, no tab ly in school cons truc t ion and the transfer o f respons ib i l i t ies o f hiring teacher t o the 
decentralized leve ls (region). The objectives o f the PDDEB t o build about 2,300 classroom each year was 
n o t achieved in 2002/2003 (1000 classrooms) and in 2003/2004 (2000 classrooms). With the recent 
creation o f an in ter-m in is ter ia l committee, the Government seems to n o w be fully comm i t ted to tackle the 
challenges o f the education system. On the donor side, there i s a clear need to forma l ize the ro les and 
responsibilities fo r be t ter donor coordination. 

52. 
In the hea l th sector, the Government con t inued to implement a vacc ina t ion campaign, and mos t 
PRSP targets fo r vaccination rates have been met. There has also been a modest p ick -up in hea l th center 

- 83 - 

usage rates, but fur ther e f for ts as regards resource f lows to hea l th centers and hea l th center s ta f f ing are 
necessary to imp rove hea l th care coverage and quality. S ign i f ican t improvements have also been made in 
increasing the supply o f drinking water, and almost 70 percent o f the popu la t ion n o w has access to safe 
water, compared t o 42 percent in 1998, putting Bu rk ina Faso o n track fo r the respective MDG. 

Suppo r t ing oppo r tun i t ies f o r emp loymen t and income-generat ing act iv it ies f o r t h e poo r (pillar 3) 

53 . 
The Government’s ru ra l agenda ca l led for : (i) an improvement o f the g row th po ten t ia l o f specific 
produc t ive sectors; (ii) a reduc t ion in the vu lnerab i l i ty o f agr icu l tura l activities; (iii) in tens i f ica t ion and 
modern iza t ion o f agriculture; (iv) an increase and d ivers i f ica t ion o f r u r a l income; and (v) p romo t ion o f 
loca l govemance. 

54. 
The C A S objectives were fully in l i n e with the PRSP objectives and a imed at supporting the 
development o f n o n trad i t iona l agr icu l tura l exports, p romo t ing so i l fe r t i l i ty and water conservation 
technologies, boos t ing o f farm mechanization, supporting the increase o f the competitiveness o f co t ton 
sector, and empower ing loca l communities to manage the ir own development. 

55. 
Overa l l , achievements o f stated objectives are considered met with the exception o f the 
in tens i f ica t ion and modern iza t ion o f a p c u l t u r e wh ich i s p a r t i a l l y met. M o r e specifically, support to the 
improvemen t o f the g row th po ten t ia l o f specific produc t ive sector has beenfully met. A new cooperative 
l a w was prepared a l low ing the set up o f 13 reg iona l chambers o f agr icu l ture and the crea t ion o f the inter- 
professional association o f p r iva te sector organization (APIPAC). The invo lvemen t o f APIPAC and 
producers organ iza t ion in service de l ivery has fac i l i ta ted and increased farmers’ access to markets, inputs 
and technology. 
A lso , the established guarantee fund has a l lowed approva l o f over 100 loans by 
commerc ia l banks t o finance m icro-pro jec ts fo r pr iva te irr iga t ion , representing 144 m i l l i o n s CFA . 

56. 
The focus o f e f for ts o n the cotton, fruit and vegetable sectors has l e d to an increase o f production, 
exports and farmers’ income. To ta l amount pa id to farmers fo r seed co t ton p roduc t ion increased f r om 80 
b i l l ions C F A to 100 b i l l ions C F A f r om 2000 to 2004, and exports o f f r u i t s and vegetables increased by 1 
b i l l i o n C F A in 2002. Sheanut exports also expanded with support f r om the Canadians. T h i s has 
con tr ibu ted to increase and d ive rs i fy r u r a l income, but more support to n o n trad i t iona l supply chains and 
to d ivers i f ica t ion to enable the p r iva te sector to seize marke t opportunities in sub-regional and 
in terna t iona l trade i s needed since p r iva te investment, innova t ion and marke ted volumes have rema ined 
m in ima l . 

57. 
During the CAS period, the approach to extension and research has evo lved towa rd a more 
demand-driven approach for agr icu l ture services de l ivery . The ac t iv i t ies under the Second Na t iona l 
Ag r icu l tu ra l Services Deve lopmen t Project (PNDSA 11) were redirected during i t s mid te rm review in 
June 2001 to adapt to the r e v i s e d approach. The new approach to extension a l lowed producers to develop 
2,700 micro-projects in the amount o f C F A F 4.5 b i l l i o n . Desp i te pos i t ive achievements in ins t i tu t iona l 
capacity, relationships between producers and agr icu l tura l services, the P N S D A I1 closed in December 
2004 with unsatisfactory ra t ings o n i t s development objectives and imp lemen ta t ion . I t s imp lemen ta t ion 
was hampered by l o n g delays in c i v i l w o r k and equipment fo r research institutions, INERA and IRSAT, 
difficulties in adapting t o the demand-driven approach and unclear moda l i t ies fo r the fruit processing 
fac i l i ty at pro jec t closure. 

58. 
A l o t o f technologies have been generated by research using a par t ic ipa tory approach fo r 
imp rov ing farm ing techniques and so i l f e r t i l i t y so as t o increase fa rm p roduc t iv i ty , especially in cotton. 
Fe r t i l ize r formulas that are deemed econom ica l ly produc t ive have been cons tan t ly improved, as technical 
progress and the market economy have a l lowed . This has p rov ided co t ton growers with savings o f 10 
percent in the cost o f fer t i l izer . However , the i r dissemination i s l im i t e d due t o lack o f cred i t to fac i l i ta te

Performance - has been Satisfactory. The Government was very e f fec t ive in de f in ing a sound 
p o l i c y framework for ru ra l development, and managing, mon i to r ing and eva lua t ing projects and 
programs. I t succeeded to timely l ibera l ize the co t ton sector wh ich became one o f the mos t successful in

and to w o r k in synergy. Donors also agreed to harmonize support to farmers’ organ iza t ion based o n the 
results o f the PND S A .

Sus ta inab i l i ty - The challenge w i l l be to scale up the good results achieved during the C A S

Supporting good governance and institutional reform (pillar 4) 

65. 
The PRSP presents four guiding pr inc ip les t o imp rove governance: (i) adop t ing a mo re 
comprehensive approach to pub l ic finance management to ensu re that pub l ic funds are managed under 
consistent and transparent r u l e s , and in con fo rm i ty with in terna t iona l ly accepted good practices; 
(ii) reduc ing Government in terven t ion and d iscre t ion in economic ac t iv i ty ; (iii) mak ing the Government 
mo re accountable by increasing pa r t ic ipa t ion o f electoral bodies, c i v i l society groups and the p r iva te 
sector in p o l i c y design, implementation, and mon i tor ing ; and (iv) ensuring a more e f f ic ien t use o f pub l ic 
revenues by focus ing pub l ic p o l i c y eva lua t ion o n results o n the ground. Ano ther objective, fos ter ing 
decentralization, i s at t h e center stage o f the Government’s strategy t o imp rove pub l ic administration’s 
performance and citizen’s par t ic ipa t ion . 

66 . 

T o support the need fo r imp roved pub l ic sector performance, the C A S focused o n budge t 
formulation, 
imp lemen ta t ion and external auditing, and o n the deconcentration and decentralization 
agendas, ma in ly through AAA and the PRSCs. 

67 . 

Results have been mixed. V is-a-v is o f pub l ic sector management and economic governance, 
substantial progress has been made. A var ie ty o f impo r tan t p o l i c y re forms have been undertaken w h i c h 
resulted in improved budget formulation, execution, repo r t ing and control, imp roved transparency in 
fiscal management, and l a i d the g roundwo rk f o r the deconcentration and decentralization o f pub l ic 
services. M a i n accomplishments have been: (i) prepara t ion o f g loba l MTEFs and full in tegra t ion in 
budget preparation cyc le in 2002-3003 w h i c h l e d t o increased rea l ism o f revenue targets and imp roved 
budget arbitration; (ii) full opera t iona l iza t ion o f the compu ter ized expenditure management system; 
(iii) establishment o f program budgets and ca r ry ing pub l ic expenditures rev iews in education, health,

infrastructure, and ru ra l development sectors p i lo ted by a PER supervision Comm i t tee since 2003; 
(iv) ac t ion p l a n fo r the deconcentration o f budgetary expenditure, as pa r t o f the decentralization process, 
f o r wh ich a successful p i l o t experiment was conducted at Bobo-Dioulasso in 2003, and l e d t o the 
expansion o f the p rog ram to fou r other regions in 2004; (v) adoption o f a new procurement code in 2003 
t o imp rove the transparency and e f f ic iency o f Government purchasing; (vi) creation o f an independent 
Supreme Audit Cou r t and i t s operationalization in 2002; and (vii) submission o f budget execution reports 
to the audit cour t f o r the years 1996-2001. To Wher s treng then control, the Na t iona l Assembly adopted 
a new l a w regu la t ing budget laws in 2003, a l ign ing na t iona l l a w w i t h WAEMU directive. 

68. 
In add i t ion to pub l ic expenditure reforms, the Government re in forced governance aspects by 
con t inu ing to strengthen the ins t i tu t iona l system to fight fraud and corrup t ion . T o that effect, i t has 
established the High Au tho r i ty fo r the Coord ina t ion against Co r rup t ion in 2002 w h i c h became operational 
in 2003. A lso , the budget execution reports through 2003 have been evaluated by the Supreme Audit 
Cou r t and the Na t iona l Assembly. In the area o f jus t ice reform, progress has been made with the adop t ion 
o f a decree in July 2002 that marks the beginning o f the e f fo r t to rehab i l i ta te the jud ic ia ry system and 
in i t ia t ives to increase know ledge and access to justice. But the rev ised Na t iona l P lan fo r Good 
Governance, p lanned fo r 2004, cou ld n o t be agreed upon by the Govemmen t and i t s development 
partners. A lso , procurement regulations have been strengthened and the gap be tween unit prices o f 
products obtained by pub l ic bidding and those obtained by the pr iva te sector has been reduced. 

69. 
However , progress o n broader pub l ic adm in is tra t ion r e f o rm and decentralization agendas has 
been l im i ted during the C A S period, with substantial delays in imp lemen t ing the Comprehensive Re fo rm 
o f Pub l ic Adm in is tra t ion , adopted in 1998, in securing and deconcentrating the integrated human 
resources database in l i n e ministries, and in transferring resources and respons ib i l i t ies beyond urban 
communes, where the transfers nonetheless rema in limited. A l though the lega l framework was created to 
delegate c red i ts to reg ions and provinces and to deconcentrate the issuance o f payment orders to 
accelerate de l ive ry o f basic services, add i t iona l reductions in the t ime i s needed t o i s s u e payment orders. 
New personnel management system and performance rev iews were instituted and the framework fo r ro le 
and a t t r ibu t ion o f governors adopted t o implement the decentralization laws, and the computerized c i v i l 
service pay ro l l and salary management system (SIGASPE) f ina l ized . I t n o w has t o be deconcentrated and 
imp lemen ted at the reg iona l and loca l levels. Recent progress i s t o be no t iced with three loca l 
communities n o w operating the software fo r the integrated management system, he lp ing to increase 
accoun tab i l i ty in the management o f pub l ic resources at the loca l level, and the 13 governors o f regions 
who took o f f ice in December 2004. 

70. 
Fur ther improvemen t i s needed, in par t icu lar v i s - & v i s the leve l o f budge t deconcentration and the 
in tegra t ion o f program budgets with the trad i t iona l budget. W h i l e execu t ion rates fo r the social sector 
budget stayed high, the size o f deconcentrated budget in hea l th and the execu t ion rates in the education 
system are s t i l l limited. Fou r m in is tr ies are n o w beneficiaries o f delegated credits, and the Ministry o f 
Secondary Educa t ion i s expected to receive delegated credits in 2005. 

71. 
In the area o f decentralization, the ins t i tu t iona l reorgan iza t ion o f the Ministry o f Te r r i to r ia l 
Adm in is t ra t ion and Decen tra l iza t ion (MATD) took p lace in 2002 and the lega l guidelines on 
decentralization were rev ised to re f lec t the new organizational system fo r decentralization supplemented 
in 2001 with the establishment o f regions. Since then, almost n o progress was made until recently. The 
adoption o f the new Decen tra l iza t ion Code in December 2004 puts an end to the debates o f the last few 
years o n the f ina l shape o f the te r r i to r ia l system o f Bu rk ina Faso, w h i c h were pa ra lyz ing the operational 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the re fo rm . N o w that the Province’s f ina l status has been c la r i f ied and that communal 
elections are planned fo r 2005 and reg iona l ones in 2007, i t w i l l be possible to re-focus on the d i f f i c u l t 
tasks o f the concrete operational mechanisms fo r the imp lemen ta t ion o f the re form .

Bank instruments - The Bank’s support to p romo t ing good governance has been two - fo ld : the 
PRSC p rog ram and k e y analytical reports, inc lud ing the Coun try Procurement Assessmen t Repor t 
(CPAR), 
the Coun t ry F inanc ia l Accoun tab i l i ty Assessment (CFAA), 
the j o i n t B a n k - IM F H I P C 
Assessments and A c t i o n P lan (AAP) o f pub l ic expenditure management, the f isca l management 
improvemen t program , and the Report o n Observance o f Standards and Codes (ROSC). In a continued 
e f for t to bring greater transparency to the budgetary process, a number o f expenditure rev iews were 
conducted in health, basic education, ru ra l development and road construction. Also, a Pub l ic 
Expend i ture R e v i ew (PER) was carried out in FY04 .

73. 
The se lec t ion o f these instruments p roved jud ic ious . The PRSC program has been ins trumen ta l in 
suppor t ing budget, c i v i l service and decentralization reforms. The AAA program grea t ly con tr ibu ted to 
the Government’s k e y p o l i c y reforms and sector strategies and the Bank ’s preparation o f future projects. 
The C F A A recommendations contributed to the budget management r e f o rm p lan adopted in July 2002.

well protected from budget cuts. 

74. 
Performance - has been Satisfactory. 
Imp lemen ta t ion o f budget management r e f o rm can be 
considered successful, even though i t i s s t i l l a work-in-progress. 
In particular, the leve l o f budget 
deconcentration and the in tegra t ion o f program budget with the t rad i t iona l budget need to be improved . 
In terms o f broader governance areas, and in par t icu lar fo r c i v i l service re fo rm and decentralization, 
performance has been re la t ive ly weak, but recent k e y pos i t ive developments vis-a-vis the decentralization 
agenda anticipates good prospects. 

75. 

Sus ta inab i l i ty - The Government’s performance in the area o f budget management has shown 
results and c ruc ia l steps, such as the imp lemen ta t ion o f an in tegra ted f inanc ia l management system, are 
be ing sustained. The imp roved governance i s more than l i k e l y go ing t o be sustained, especially with the

78. 
D e s p i t e continued efforts to strengthen f inanc ia l management and procurement systems, some 
f iduc ia ry r i s k s with regard to the u s e of pub l ic funds remain, due to weak qua l i ty o f in terna l and external 
con tro ls o f pro jec t teams, and a lack o f f inanc ia l reporting. Procurement issues a r e a key factor in s low 
p o r t f o l i o implementation, with very l o n g delays in contract execution. Also, the ins t i tu t iona l capacity in 
imp lemen t ing projects i s s t i l l weak. 

79. 
During the C A S period, W B I ’ s in terven t ion has gradually shifted f r om ad hoc t ra in ing to capacity 
building activities. This emphasis o n a longer te rm and more strategic ro le o f the I n s t i t u t e in the coun try 
i s supported by the fact that Bu rk ina Faso was selected in FY03 as a WBI focus country. A Coun t ry 
P rog ram Brief endorsed by the Coun try Team and updated annually n o w serves as the m a i n ins trumen t 
f o r a l ign ing WBI ac t iv i t ies on the PRSP and C A S and ta i lo r ing them to the coun try ’s needs. Programs 
that were de l ivered during the C A S pe r iod s tar ted to address themes such as H I V / A I D S , PRSP 
preparation, ru ra l development, commun i ty empowerment and decentralization. These are indeed key 
issues and instruments for the coun try to meet i t s development challenges. T o increase i t s impac t in the 
country, WBI n o w needs to focus o n strengthening s y n e r g y with lend ing operations and AAA. The new 
C A S w i l l p rov ide an excellent oppor tun i ty to achieve that goal. 

80. 
De layed effectiveness, s low imp lemen ta t ion and f iduc iary constraints have impac ted o n the 
disbursement ra t io wh ich declined substantially in FY02-03 , at 14 and 13.3 percent respectively. The 
disbursement ra t io increased to 20 percent in F Y 0 4 but several projects have very l o w disbursement ratio, 
and w i l l n o t be able to fully disburse by their current c los ing date i f n o acceleration in their

Over the CAS period, The Qua l i ty Assurance Group (QAG) ra ted p ro jec t qua l i ty at en try at 100

A l l ICRs rev iewed were ra ted satisfactory and the H e a l tW u t r i t i o n pro jec t was considered as exemplary.

The po r t fo l io compos i t ion has changed during the C A S period, re f lec t ing t h e Bank’s approach to 
increas ing ly support the PRSP through programma t ic budget support, and concentrate i t s investment 
operations o n large infrastructures, and commun i ty-dr iven development operations. The B a n k has also

Locus t pro jec t . 

84. 
Po r t fo l io management i s decentralized to the Coun t ry O f f i c e in Ouagadougou. During the CAS 
period, two Coun try po r t fo l io performance rev iews (CPPR) were carr ied out. The f i r s t one took p lace in 
2002 and concluded that the mos t c r i t ica l issues were o n effectiveness and start-up delays, and weak 
absorptive capacity due to lack o f decentralization and a cumbersome procuremen t system. The 2004 
CPPR developed a results-based approach. I t re i tera ted the 2002 CPPR findings and underscored the 
inadequacy o f mon i to r ing systems, a l though increased mon i to r ing and eva lua t ion capacities and mo re 
ins t i tu t iona l ized M&E system were no ted fo r the mos t recen t ly approved projects. 

85. 
At the country leve l , progress in establishing a better M&E sys tem was made during the CAS

indicators, and p rov ided a log ica l framework and an investment p rog ram with a de ta i led costing through 
the preparation o f a detailed P r io r i ty Ac t ion P lan (PAP). The P A P constitutes a ma jo r achievement for

Coordination with other donors has been par t icu lar ly strong, a lbe i t challenging, o n budget 
support, wh ich was regulated by a Memorandum o f Understanding with other development partners. The

group SBC (soutien budge‘taire conjoint) led by the EU and a few b i la te ra l donors, because o f a na r row 
de f in i t ion o f disbursement conditions. A new framework fo r budget support that includes the B a n k and 
the AfDB has been adopted in January 2005. 

8 7 . With rega rd t o investment lending, the Bank has been active in co l labora t ing closely with other 
donors to ensu re consistency in the coun try p o l i c y dialogue, and a d iv is ion o f labor in lending and n o n 
lending services. Examples inc lude support to the education sector, HIV/AIDS and water supply, a l l of 
wh ich have developed a strong donors’ coordination. 

8 8 . 

In the case o f education, the ten-year education p rog ram has been the framework fo r a l l donor 
interventions. A partnership agreement was s igned by 13 donors and the Government fo r their support to 
basic education, with Canada p lay ing the ro le o f coordinator o f donors. Common f iduc ia ry arrangements, 
procurement procedures, accounting and f inanc ia l management between Canada, Netherlands and the 
Bank were to be set up but a clear imp lemen ta t ion framework was never prepared. This led to 
coord ina t ion prob lems and tensions b e tw e e n donors.

NGOs and c i v i l society have become in tegra l partners in the PRSP and a l l development ac t iv i t ies 
in Bu rk ina Faso. M o r e donors are channeling the ir resources to na t iona l and in terna t iona l NGOs, v i l lage

The f o l l ow i n g lessons emerge f r om the imp lemen ta t ion o f the 2000 C A S and draw upon the 
challenges ahead: 

0 The med ium- term macroeconomic ou t look i s compounded by i t s vu lne rab i l i ty t o adverse economic 
external developments and shocks. This presents a challenge, necessitating corrective measures such 
as d ivers i f ica t ion o f trade links and transport in fras truc ture in order t o raise produc t iv i ty , especially in 
the ru ra l sector, and investment rates, and a more developed p r iva te sector and better access t o credit 
fo r the pr iva te sector. 
M o r e emphasis o n reg iona l dimensions i s needed t o ensure the country’s successful invo lvemen t in 
the reg iona l in tegra t ion and g loba l iza t ion process, and g ive the coun try access to larger markets.

R a i n f a l l patterns rema in the predominant de tem inan t o f agr icu l tura l output. Ra is ing effectiveness o f 
r u r a l deve lopmen t spending to increase the benefits o f g row th fo r ru ra l popu la t ion remains one o f the 
k e y challenges in a t ta in ing the income-poverty MDG. 
G r o w t h in the p r ima ry sector has been ma in ly d r iven by the expansion o f agr icu l tura l surfaces in light 
o f imp roved ra in fa l ls . These g row th rates cannot be sustained over a l o n g pe r iod un less they are 
accompanied by higher mechanization and fer t i l izer use to increase p roduc t iv i ty and ma in ta in so i l 
fer t i l i ty , and increased agr icu l tura l diversification. 
The m a i n focus during the CAS pe r iod by b o t h the Government and donors has been o n basic 
education, thus n o t achieving a be t te r balance between the various levels o f the education sys tem to 
l a y the founda t ion fo r needs o f future workforce. 
Desp i te substantial progress achieved in the enro l lmen t o f girls in school, access o f r u r a l women t o 
ag r icu l tu ra l extension services, and par t ic ipa t ion o f women in po l i t ica l bodies, the persistence o f 
systemic lega l and socio-cultural barriers to women’s empowerment entails that women’s soc ia l and 
economic status and welfare remains weak. 
In the u rban sector, assistance during the CAS pe r iod has been ma in ly targeted to Ouagadougou. The 
r a p i d urban iza t ion o f the popu la t ion w i l l strongly burden secondary cities wh ich already su f fer f r om 
lack o f investment, limited and dilapidated stock o f infrastructure, poo r urban services and weak 
administrative, f inanc ia l and human resources. The donors’ assistance w i l l have to be re-d irec ted to 
correct this imbalance. 
Con t inued weak coun try capacity hampered imp lemen ta t ion capacity, pa r t icu la r ly in l i n e m in is tr ies . 
The Bur lunabb adm in is tra t ion i s plagued by ine f f ic ienc ies and poo r human resource po l ic ies . The 
B a n k needs to continue to support the Government in budgetary management, decentralization and 
deconcentration through the PRSC program and the Adm in is t ra t ion capacity building p ro jec t in order 
t o he lp the Government strengthen i t s capacity and imp rove de l ive ry o f services. 

92. 
The design o f the PRSC recognized that comp lemen tar i ty o f e f for ts between programma t ic 
support and investment lend ing was key to mak ing e f f ic ien t use o f B a n k resources. This p roved t o be a 
key element in progress achieved during the CAS . F o r example, the m a i n focus in agr icu l ture o f the 
PRSC p rog ram has been o n opening up the co t ton sector to the p r iva te sector and ins t i tu t iona l re fo rms 
and the three ru ra l sector investment credits have addressed specific issues that cou ld n o t eas i ly be 
rep l ica ted through budget support. 

93. 
Q A G conducted a rev iew o f the PRSC-1 and conc luded that the ove ra l l qua l i ty at en try and B a n k 
processes were satisfactory, and the resu l ts o f PRSC-1 likely t o be sustained. I t agreed that the strong 
emphasis o n imp rov ing resource management and accoun tab i l i ty w o u l d help imp rove the effectiveness o f 
service de l ivery , especially in education and health. The ICRs f o r the f i r s t PRSC series conc luded that 
the programma t ic instrument supported the focus o n the budget as the m a i n ins trumen t fo r the PRSP 
imp lemen ta t ion and no ted the accomplishments in strengthening expenditure and con t ro l systems and in 
suppor t ing cross-cutting reforms, among them the app l ica t ion o f deconcentration po l ic ies in budget and 
personnel management. I t also no ted that strong focus in t h e com ing years should be o n helping stimulate 
growth, imp rov ing the PRSC-related sectoral dialogue, b e t t e r a l ign ing budget support with the budge t 
cycle, re in fo rc ing the capacity o f the Adm in is t ra t ion t o formu la te and execute programs, and imp rov ing 
the link between po l icy actions and the M&E framework . Since PRSC-4, the B a n k has started to better 
a l ign i t s programmatic development lend ing operations with the Burk inabk budget cycle. A lso , the 
rev ised PRSP adopted last October 2004 by the Au thor i t ies , n o w integrates a detailed P r io r i ty A c t i o n 
Plan, wh ich should contribute to imp rove social expenses e f f ic iency .
