1. 

Gabon i s a resource-rich coun try w i t h a small, h igh ly urbanized popu la t ion . The coun try i s we l l - 
endowed with arable land, forest and m ine ra l resources, but o i l has been fo r long Gabon’s m a i n economic 
sector and the p r inc ipa l d r iv ing force o f i t s growth. Despite the h igh per capita income that the o i l sector 
has afforded, the country has no t been able to overcome the challenges o f equitable economic 
development and minimum social we l fare fo r all. Inequa l i ty i s high, and large sections o f the popu la t ion 
do no t have e f fec t ive access to pub l ic services. Wh i le Gabon has made progress towards mee t ing the 
M i l l e n n i um Deve lopmen t Goals, several social indicators are s t i l l lagging. 
In particular, a r is ing 
HIV/AIDS prevalence rate i s a serious concern. As the prospects fo r o i l decline, the situation i s expected 
to worsen. 

2. 

Recogn iz ing the challenges fac ing the country, the Government prepared an In te r im Pover ty 
Reduc t ion Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) in June 2003, even though as an IBRD coun try i t was n o t a 
requirement. Impor tan t po l icy actions have been taken since mid-2002, ma rk ing a s ign i f ican t break f r om 
past performance and demonstrating a renewed comm i tmen t on the par t o f the authorities to sound 
macroeconomic management. A f te r a h is to ry o f repeated slippages against IMF -suppo r ted program 
targets, performance under the current Stand-By Arrangement i s on track. The Government has made 
striking progress in the forest sector re fo rm agenda, and has taken impor tan t steps towards greater 
transparency in the management o f o i l revenues, as evidenced no tab ly by the recent declaration o f in ten t 
to adhere to the Ex trac t ive Industries Transparency In i t ia t ive (EITJ) and wo rk towards i t s imp lemen ta t ion . 
The comb ina t ion o f dec l in ing revenues and the need to imp rove social outcomes has been a powe r fu l 
incen t ive f o r Government to imp rove transparency and e f f ic iency in the use o f i t s pub l ic resources, b o t h 
na tura l and f inanc ia l . The planned W o r l d Bank Group assistance program has been designed to support 
Gabon’s e f for ts and to ensure that the curren t w indow o f oppor tun i ty i s no t lost. 

3. 

The present CAS takes i t s lead f r om the main development objectives o f the Government as 
h igh l igh ted in I-PRSP and the na t iona l prospective study “Gabon 2025”. 
The p r io r i t ies o f the 
Government over the med ium term, as re f lec ted in these documents, are: (i) to imp rove e f f ic iency in the 
use o f pub l ic resources, w i t h a focus on imp rov ing the qua l i ty and quan t i ty o f basic services; and (ii) to 
imp rove the environment fo r pr iva te sector-led inves tmen t in the non -o i l sectors o f the economy. 
Gabon’s na t iona l development strategy seeks t o generate sustained g row th f o r pove r ty reduction. 
F o l l ow i n g the comp le t ion o f i t s I-PRSP, Gabon has undertaken the preparation o f a G r ow t h and Pover ty 
Reduc t ion Strategy Paper (GPRSP) that w i l l f o rm the basis o f i t s fu ture development strategy. The Bank 
i s assisting Government to f ina l ize the GPRSP. 

4. 

This i s the third assistance strategy the Bank ’ has prepared fo r Gabon. The first t w o were 
prepared in 1994 and 1998, respectively. A l though the ho r izon o f the 1998 Coun t ry Assistance Strategy 
(CAS) did no t extend beyond 2001, a f ter that date the B a n k continued to imp lemen t operations prepared 
under the previous programs. The last t w o operations in the Bank’s po r t fo l io , an u rban development LIL 
and a pr iva t iza t ion project, closed in June 2004. The 1998 C A S embraced an amb i t ious agenda fo r 
po l i t ica l and social reform, inc lud ing s ign i f ican t a t ten t ion to pover ty a l lev ia t ion . However , wh i le some 
progress was made on p r iva t iza t ion and macroeconomic management, i t did no t achieve the ma jo r i ty o f 
the proposed CAS outcomes. 

5 . 

This CAS sets ou t planned lend ing and non - lend ing W o r l d B a n k G roup support t o Gabon over 
the pe r iod FY05 -09 that i s less ambitious. Ac t iv i t ies have been selected based on the ir a l ignmen t w i t h the 
Government’s objectives and the W o r l d Bank Group ’s comparative advantage. O ther development 
partners p lan lending, grant and techn ica l support i n areas that complement the Bank ’s areas o f 
comparative advantage. The CAS i s ar t icu la ted around t w o pillars: (1) strengthening the management o f 
pub l ic resources (both na tura l and f inanc ia l) fo r imp roved social outcomes; and (2) imp rov ing the

investment c l ima te t o foster sustainable, pr iva te sector led non -o i l grow th . Cross-cutting themes are 
developing capacity in Government, c i v i l society, and imp rov ing governance and par t ic ipa t ion . 

6. 

The Bank ’s base-case assistance program w i l l inc lude three lend ing operations in the urban, 
na tura l resources, and infrastructure sectors: a US$25 m i l l i o n Pub l ic Investment Program fo r L o c a l 
In fras truc ture Deve lopmen t Project expected to be presented to the Boa rd in June 2005, a US$15 m i l l i o n 
Na tu ra l Resources Management Development Po l icy Loan fo r FY06 , and a US$25 m i l l i o n In fras truc ture 
Pro jec t in FYO8 . Each operation places emphasis on imp rov ing transparency and e f f ic iency in use o f 
pub l ic resources, inc lud ing na tura l resources, and on imp rov ing the environment f o r greater par t ic ipa t ion 
o f the p r iva te sector. In the Base Case, the lend ing program planned fo r F Y 0 5 t o FY09 thus amounts to 
US$65 m i l l ion , in add i t ion to US$1.5 m i l l i o n wh ich wou ld be sought in IDF grants, and a US$10 m i l l i o n 
GEF supporting the na t iona l Forest and Env ironmen t Sector Program (PSFE). Non- lend ing ac t iv i t ies 
inc lude con t inu ing support fo r GPRSP preparation (and i t s subsequent implementation), pub l ic f inanc ia l 
management, p r iva te sector development, c i v i l society capacity development and a Pover ty Assessment. 
Curren t ly I F C has an exposure o f US$3.8 m i l l i o n i n the o i l and gas sector, and the W o r l d Bank Group’s 
Fore ign Investment Adv iso ry Services (FMS) has recen t ly completed a diagnostic study o f the 
investment climate. A US$61 m i l l i o n M IGA guarantee fac i l i ty fo r rehab i l i ta t ion and modern iza t ion o f a 
professional t ra in ing ins t i tu te i s expected to be presented to the Boa rd in M a y 2005. This pro jec t i s 
MIGA’s first in t h e education sector. 

7 . 

The current situation in Gabon i s considered to be the Base Case. Rema in ing in the Base Case 
wou ld be predicated on continued satisfactory macroeconomic performance and con t inued progress in the 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the forest re fo rm agenda as evidenced no tab ly by con t inued imp lemen ta t ion o f the 
mo ra to r ium on a l loca t ion o f new perm i ts until the new transparent auction procedures are implemented. 
In the event that the coun try fa l ls short o f meeting the base-case cr i ter ia , a low-case scenario w o u l d be 
activated wh ich wou ld invo lve no new lend ing and a reduced leve l o f AAA support. 

8. 

Consideration f o r mov ing t o a High Case wou ld be based on a modulated approach whereby in 
the f i r s t instance a pa r t icu la r ly good track record o f performance o f re forms i n the na tura l resource sector 
wou ld tr igger presentation o f a second Na tu ra l Resources Management D P L (US$10 m i l l ion ) fo r Boa rd 
consideration in FY08. Beyond t h i s , specific actions to imp rove the broader investment c l ima te wou ld 
trigger preparation o f a D ive rs i f ica t ion support operation (US$18 m i l l ion ) f o r Boa rd presentation in 
FY09 . M o r e substantial Bank l IFC co l labora t ion wou ld also be considered. 

9 . 

The main ex terna l risk a f fec t ing the ab i l i ty o f t h i s CAS to achieve i t s objectives wou ld be a sharp 
drop in pe tro leum prices. The main in te rna l risk i s o f a departure f r o m good f isca l management practices. 
There i s also a risk that comm i tmen t to structural re forms w i l l diminish over t ime and/or vested interests 
w i l l succeed in preven t ing such re forms f r om be ing implemented. Comm i tmen t t o the re fo rm agenda i s 
likely t o be strengthened fo l low ing elections, as the Government w i l l face l e s s pressure to manage the 
impac t o f po l icy imp lemen ta t ion on vested interests. A stronger ro le f o r Parliament, the pr iva te sector, 
and c i v i l society, a long w i t h a cred ib le and w e l l func t ion ing l aw and jus t ice sector, w i l l also he lp to h o l d 
the Government accountable. Bank- and other partner-supported capacity development ac t iv i t ies w i l l 
help strengthen these roles. 

The fo l low ing issues are suggested fo r Boa rd discussion: 
The appropriateness o f the t w o “pillars”, as de f ined in paragraph 6, as en try po in ts towards 
the u l t ima te goa l o f pove r ty reduction; and 
Whether the Bank p rog ram strikes the right balance between be ing rea l is t ic , as recommended 
in the CASCR , and p rov id ing adequate support t o address Gabon’s development pr ior i t ies . 

I. 

INTRODUCTION 

1. 

This Coun t ry Assistance Strategy (CAS) sets ou t planned lend ing and non- lend ing W o r l d B a n k 
Group support to Gabon over the per iod FY05-09 . The last CAS fo r Gabon was discussed by the B o a r d 
in September 1998. I t ca l led fo r the Bank to transcend i t s trad i t iona l lend ing ro le and instead p lay the ro le 
o f a know ledge bank. A l though many o f the outcomes envisaged i n the F Y 9 9 C A S did n o t materialize, 
ongo ing pro jec ts prov ided fo r con t inu i ty in the dialogue w i t h Gabon. Beg inn ing in 2003, the Bank 
became mo re ac t ive in Gabon, and coun try economic performance improved . Lessons learned since 
FY99 , rev iewed in a C A S Comp le t ion Repor t (CASCR) (see Annex 4), have been taken in to account in 
prepar ing the present CAS . 

2. 

A l though Gabon i s an IBRD Borrower , i t has undertaken the preparation o f a PRSP, k n ow n 
loca l ly as the G row th and Poverty Reduc t ion Strategy paper or GPRSP, wh ich w i l l f o rm the basis o f i t s 
fu ture development strategy. Because the GPRSP i s no t ye t complete, the Government has no t ye t 
established de f in i t ive mon i torab le development goals. Consequently, wh i le t h i s C A S i s roo ted in the 
GPRSP, i t does n o t meet the full requirements fo r a Results-Based CAS . However, an In ter im-PRSP (I- 
PRSP) was prepared in June 2003 and underpins this CAS . The CAS i s also roo ted in a results-based 
f ramewo rk (Annex 1) l i n k i n g planned Bank actions t o Gabon’s med ium- and long - te rm development 
objectives v ia intermediate (CAS period) outcomes. The m id - te rm C A S rev iew ( to take place in FY07 ) 
w i l l , i f needed, p rov ide an oppor tun i ty t o fine-tune the a l ignmen t o f the CAS w i t h the completed GPRSP 
and to establish quan t i ta t ive measures o f performance. 

3 . 

The C A S i s articulated around tw o pillars: (1) strengthening the management o f pub l ic resources 
(bo th na tu ra l and f inanc ia l) fo r imp roved social outcomes; and (2) imp rov ing the investment c l ima te to 
foster sustainable, private-sector-led growth. 
Cross-cutting 
themes are developing capacity 
in 
Government, c i v i l society, and the pr iva te sector, and imp rov ing governance and participation. 

4. 

Planned lend ing in the Base Case wou ld amount to US$65 m i l l i o n fo r three operations in support 
o f these p i l lars , and US$11.5 m i l l i o n in re la ted GEF and IDF grants. Rema in ing in the Base Case wou ld 
be predicated on continued satisfactory macroeconomic performance as evidenced by, in te r alia, a 
successor arrangement with the IMF f o l l ow i n g the exp i ra t ion o f the Stand-By in June 2005 and con t inued 
satisfactory performance under such an arrangement; and con t inued progress in the imp lemen ta t ion o f the 
forest r e f o rm agenda as evidenced no tab ly by con t inued imp lemen ta t ion o f the mo ra to r ium on a l loca t ion 
o f new perm i ts until the new transparent auction procedures are implemented. Departure f r om these 
wou ld tr igger a L o w Case, under wh ich Bank invo lvemen t wou ld be restricted to non- lend ing ac t iv i t ies 
after an i n i t i a l pro jec t in FY05 . 

5 . 

Consideration f o r mov ing to a H i g h Case w o u l d be based on a modulated approach whereby in 
the first instance a pa r t icu la r ly good track reco rd o f performance o f re forms in the na tura l resource sector 
wou ld tr igger presentation of a second Na tu ra l Resources Management D P L (US$ lO m i l l i o n ) fo r Boa rd 
presentation in FY08 . The specific triggers fo r this first modu le wou ld inc lude : full imp lemen ta t ion o f 
the Ex t rac t ive Industries Transparency In i t ia t ive (EITI); and the full and e f fec t ive abo l i t ion o f the expor t 
monopo ly o f SNBG by January 2006. Beyond t h i s , rema in ing in the High Case wou ld be predicated on 
specific actions to bring about s ign i f ican t improvemen ts in the investment climate, wh ich wou ld tr igger 
preparation o f a D ive rs i f ica t ion support operation (US$18 m i l l i o n ) f o r Boa rd presentation in FY09 . 
Specific cr i ter ia for mov ing fo rwa rd w i t h this operation w o u l d be the comp le t ion o f the p r iva t iza t ion o f 
Gabon Te lecom and o f actions recommended by the W o r l d Bank Group ’s Fore ign Inves tmen t Adv iso ry 
Services (FIAS) on pub l ic procurement and rea l estate titles. 

6. 

Beyond IBRD, broader W o r l d Bank Group support i s curren t ly limited, a l though such support 
cou ld develop over the C A S period. There i s scope fo r increased Bank / IFC co l labora t ion i f Gabon 
continues to make good progress, especially i f i t moves to the High Case. A US$61 m i l l i o n MIGA 
guarantee fac i l i ty f o r rehab i l i ta t ion and modern iza t ion o f a professional tra in ing ins t i tu te i s expected to be 
presented to the Boa rd in M a y 2005. 

11. COUNTRY CONTEXT 

7 . 

A. Po l it ica l Economy and Social Context 
Gabon i s a resource-rich country w i th a small, highly urban ized population. Ex tend ing over 
267,667 km2 on the west coast o f equatorial A f r ica , Gabon i s we l l-endowed w i t h arable land, forest and 
m ine ra l resources. I t i s the fourth-largest producer o f pe tro leum in A f r i c a after N iger ia , Ango la and 
Equa tor ia l Guinea, and the second largest exporter o f t imber after Cameroon. 
I t has ex traord inary

in 1960, and E l Had j Omar Bongo Ondimba, in power since 1967 and now the longest serving President 
in A f r ica . The country shifted f r om single-party ru le back to a mu l t i -pa r ty po l i t ica l system in the early 
1990s. However, the par ty o f the President, P D G (Pa r t i Democratique Gabona is) maintains a dom inan t

Gabon plays a leading economic ro le in Cen t ra l A f r ica . Gabon's membership in C E M A C 

(Communaute' Economique e t Mone'taire de 1 'Afrique Cen t ra le ) , the Cen tra l A f r i c a n Econom ic and 
Mone ta ry Un ion , w i t h a common C F A currency and exchange rate regime, has strengthened economic 
management b y creating a reg iona l f ramewo rk fo r macroeconomic surveillance and an ins t i tu t iona l fo rum 
fo r p o l i c y dialogue. Adherence to the C E M A C convergence criteria, a set o f f isca l and s truc tura l targets, 
has he lped constrain monetary and f isca l expansion. Furthermore, Gabon's membership in the trade 
regime, w i t h a common external t a r i f f (CET), has acted as an inducement to considerable trade 
l ibe ra l iza t ion f rom the early 1990s, b o t h through reduc t ion o f average ta r i f fs and by remov ing 
quantitative restrictions. F ina l ly , Gabon, together w i t h Cameroon, has been one o f the p r ime movers o f 
sub-regional in tegra t ion in Cen tra l A f r ica , and has promo ted reg iona l in i t ia t ives t o boost the economic 
inter-relationships among the member states o f the zone.

Gabon i s also a key member o f the Congo Basin Forest Partnersh ip . In 2005 and 2006, 
Gabon w i l l chair the Cen tra l A f r ican Forest Comm iss ion (COM IFAC ) , f o l l ow i n g the Heads o f State 
Summit he ld in B razzav i l le in February 2005. Shared respons ib i l i ty f o r forest management i s a d r ive r o f 
reg iona l in teg ra t ion in Cen tra l A f r ica . A l l Central A f r ican countries share the Congo Bas in Forest, w h i c h 
i s o f un ique value to the g loba l commun i ty . This group o f countries has common interests and common 
claims, inc lud ing the maintenance and sustainable use o f b iod ivers i ty . 
B. Poverty P ro f i le 
Despite h igh pe r capita income, Gabon has not been ab le to overcome the challenges o f 
equitable economic development and minimum social welfare f o r all. Du r ing the i n i t i a l years a f ter 
independence, the Government invested heav i ly in cap i ta l projects and industries, assuming substantial 
debt i n the process. During the o i l boom years o f 1973 to 1985, the Government adopted economic 
po l ic ies aimed at p romo t ing full employment through pub l ic sector in i t ia t ives such as creation o f 
parastatals. The Government p rov ided generous wages and established an elaborate social security 
system which, in spite o f i t s imperfections, was considered among the best in sub-Saharan A f r ica . O i l 
wea l th brough t bene f i ts to the urban e l i te wh ich were fur ther shared through fam i ly networks, 
con tr ibu t ing to a massive ru ra l to urban exodus. L a c k o f recent data poses a challenge in understanding 
the evo lu t ion in recent years o f the d is tr ibu t iona l e f fec t o f o i l wea l th on pover ty , but the general 
perception o f loca l citizens, conveyed to the Bank during the CAS consultations, i s that l i v i n g cond i t ions 
have been steadily worsen ing over the past decade. Wh i le the red is tr ibu t ion o f rents has been successful 
in reduc ing pover ty in some countries w i t h s i m i l a r per capita incomes, t h i s does no t appear to be the case 
fo r Gabon. 

12. 

Inequa l i ty i s high, and large sections o f the popu lat ion do no t have effective access to pub l ic 
services. 
Inequa l i t ies plague the current social service de l ivery system, p r io r i t ies are o f ten misplaced, 
and access o f the poo r t o services remains low . The Bank‘s par t ic ipa tory Pover ty Assessment, completed 
in 1997, served to raise awareness o f these problems w i t h i n Government. I t showed that despite Gabon’s 
high per capita income, re la t ive pover ty in consumption terms i s widespread (at about 60 p e r ~ e n t ) ~ . M a n y 
o f Gabon’s social ind ica tors are lagg ing beh ind other IBRD countries w i t h s im i lar GDP per capita (see 
Tab le 1). Wh i le Gabon has been able to imp rove access to primary education and access to imp roved 
water sources other social ind ica tors such as immun iza t ion o f one year olds, the ma terna l mo r ta l i ty ra t io 
and H I V / A I D S prevalence (where estimates have doub led in the past tw o years) are o f par t icu lar concern. 
In the longer run, s ign i f ican t progress on equity as w e l l as g row th w i l l be essential fo r e f fec t ive and 
sustained pover ty reduction.

Relative poverty in Gabon (defined as per capita incomes of less than the minimum wage, equivalent to about U S 
$1,440 in 1993 dollars) i s very different from the extreme poverty experienced in most o f Sub-Saharan A f r i c a . S t i l l , the Poverty 
Assessment showed that per capita incomes below half this level (less than US $700) were insufficient to meet minimum 
nutritional needs and other basic spending requirements i n urban areas of Gabon.

I n 2000, the authorities began p repa r ing a Poverty Reduct ion Strategy Pape r , a lthough as

Subsequent w o r k has focused on expanding pub l ic pa r t ic ipa t ion in the process, deve lop ing a statistical 
database t o better estimate current levels o f pover ty , and w o r k i n g out sectoral strategies to focus 
government ac t iv i t ies o n pover ty reduction. W h i l e there i s r o om f o r much improvemen t in pub l ic service 
de l ive ry and the management o f pub l ic resources, the u l t ima te so lu t ion to the pover ty p rob lem in Gabon

Desp ite the fact tha t the G PR S P wo rk i s s t i l l on-going, i t was impo r tan t not to de lay a new 

CAS at this t ime . There i s a need to set Bank in terven t ions in the context o f a strategic f ramewo rk 
discussed w i t h and understood b y our clients and partners. Good progress has been made recen t ly in 
im p r o v i n g ou r d ia logue w i t h Gabon and in the country’s o w n performance. The new CAS i s needed to 
demonstrate B a n k comm i tmen t and t o ma in ta in the momen tum o f this dialogue, as w e l l as to pave the

other development partners, w i l l he lp strengthen Government comm i tmen t and capacity at a c r i t ica l

16. 

I t should be recognized, however, that this CAS i s only an intermediate step toward 

supporting poverty reduction in Gabon. Imp rov ing management o f pub l ic resources b y strengthening 
revenue mob i l iza t ion and pub l ic expenditure management i s a necessary prerequisite f o r the Government 
to p rov ide more e f f ic ien t and e f fec t ive services to the poor. S im i la r ly , improvements in in fras truc ture and 
na tu ra l resources management w i l l enhance the country’s g row th po ten t ia l bu t w i l l n o t necessarily bring 
benefits d i rec t ly to the poor. M o r e targeted assistance w i l l need to be articulated b y the en t ire donor 
commun i ty around the sector strategies wh ich are expected to be inc luded in the GPRSP, in order to 
ensure that benefits f r o m ex terna l ly- funded programs actually f l o w to the poor in the fu ture . 

C. Macroeconomic Track Record 

17. While Gabon’s past history of program implementation has been poor, important policy 
actions undertaken since mid-2002 and the broadly satisfactory track record o f budgetary 
implementation i n 2003 and 2004 have demonstrated the renewed commitment on the part o f the 
authorities to implement sustained adjustment. In M a y 2004, the Execu t ive Boa rd o f the IMF 

approved a 14-month, US$102 m i l l i o n Standby Arrangement supporting the Government’s economic 
program. The ma in thrust o f the p rog ram i s to promo te economic d ivers i f ica t ion through sustained f isca l 
adjustment and comprehensive s truc tura l reforms. The first, second and third rev iews were sa t is fac tor i ly 
conc luded in August and December 2004, and M a r c h 2005 respectively. The curren t Standby 
Arrangement expires in June 2005, and i t i s expected that i t w i l l be fo l lowed b y fur ther IMF support, the 
exact nature o f wh ich i s s t i l l under discussion. Gabon i s k e e n to rema in under an IMF arrangement 
f o l l ow i n g the exp i ra t ion o f the Stand-By Arrangement. The IMF w i l l consider the mos t appropriate 
arrangement, p rov ided that performance under the Stand-By Arrangement remains satisfactory, and based 
o n the extent to wh ich the foundations f o r a med ium- term p rog ram are deemed to be in place. The IMF 
w i l l also carry ou t a f isca l Repor t on Observance o f Standards and Codes (ROSC) as pa r t o f the process 
o f de term in ing wha t f o rm o f support wou ld be most appropriate fo r Gabon in the fu ture .

Growth has recovered somewhat 
but remains modest. While the ove ra l l 

macroeconomic env ironmen t has rema ined 
stable since 2000, the economy has been 
vu lnerab le to f luc tua t ions in o i l prices as 
w e l l as to a dec l in ing trend in o i l p roduc t ion

Fiscal policy has generally been consistent w i t h macroeconomic objectives. The Government

percent o f GDP in 2003 and 7.8 percent in 2004. Gabon has been successful i n cu r ta i l ing the g row th o f 
current expenditure by reduc ing the ra t io f r om 19.9 percent o f GDP in 2000 to 16.4 percent in 2004 and 
the wage b i l l f r om 6.4 percent to 5.9 percent o f GDP over the same period. Moreover , the Government o f 
Gabon, in consu l ta t ion w i t h in terna t iona l development partners, w i l l assess the pub l ic expenditure 
framework fo r social services and pover ty reduc t ion in t h e preparation o f the GPRSP. However , l o w 
execution rates o f the investment budget and gaps between allocated and the executed budgets continue t o 
hamper pub l ic f inanc ia l management and a f fec t the de l ivery o f pub l ic services. D u e to tighter f isca l 
measures, a reduc t ion in tax and customs exemptions, and co l lec t ion o f tax arrears, an increase in the 
mob i l iza t ion o f non -o i l revenue f r om 12.2 percent o f GD P in 2001 to 13.4 percent in 2004 has pa r t ia l ly 
compensated fo r the recent and pro jec ted decline in o i l revenue. The target under the IMF-suppor ted 
program o f reduc ing the non -o i l p r ima ry de f ic i t f r om 8.2 percent o f non -o i l GD P in 2003 to 7.7 percent in

The ex te rna l cu r ren t account, inc lud ing grants, has posted a surplus since the last CAS and 
has r isen to close to 10.4 percent o f GDP in 2004 due to higher o i l prices and a rise in manganese 
exports (see Tab le 3). 
I n 2004, to ta l exports increased b y close to 21.5 percent w i t h non -o i l exports 
increas ing b y mo re than 12 percent, wh i le impo r ts increased by 19.3 percent. However , the cap i ta l 
account has rema ined in de f ic i t due to cap i ta l ou t f lows and repatriation o f o i l p ro f i ts by fo re ign 
companies, resu l t ing in a slight overa l l balance o f payments de f ic i t . The f inanc ing gaps in 2005-2006 are 
expected to be covered b y Paris C lub debt rescheduling, use o f Fund resources, and d rawdown o f fo re ign 
reserves. 

21. 

L i k e other countries in the CFA Zone, Gabon’s in f la t ion ra te has rema ined re lat ive ly low 
over the last several years. Due to prudent monetary po l icy at the reg iona l Cen tra l Bank (BEAC ) , 
i n f l a t i o n was contained through the pe r iod and averaged be low 2 percent. Furthermore, the f i x e d 
exchange peg to the Eu ro ensures that monetary p o l i c y i s be ing used to stabilize the exchange rate and no t 
fo r domestic c red i t expansion. Also, the strict imp lemen ta t ion o f f isca l rules that set l i m i t s on B E A C 
f inanc ing to monetize de f ic i ts has helped cu r ta i l in f la t ion in Gabon. The coun try has successfully adhered 
to the reg iona l convergence cr i ter ia re la t ing to f isca l balances, consumer p r ice in f la t ion , and ex terna l debt, 
but has slipped on the cr i ter ia o f ne t changes in government arrears. The appreciation o f the Euro, 
especially vis a vis the dollar, has led to a slight appreciation o f the rea l e f fec t ive exchange rate and a 
weakening o f ove ra l l export competitiveness. 

22. 

The Government has made considerable progress on the structura l r e f o rm agenda, but 
some challenges rema in . Even though the former General D irec tora te o f P r ice Con tro ls has been 
replaced b y a new General Directorate o f Compe t i t ion , Government comm i tmen t t o p r ice l ibe ra l iza t ion 
has sometimes been questionable, in par t icu lar regard ing the automatic adjustment o f domestic re ta i l 
pr ices fo r pe tro leum products, wh ich have n o t changed since 2002. With regard to fo re ign trade, 
quan t i ta t ive restrictions s t i l l exist, especially in the sugar sector. Some pub l ic enterprises, such as the 
p a lm o i l company AgroGabon and the rubber company Hevegab, have been successfully pr iva t ized . 
However , progress has been slow in p r iva t iz ing other companies such as Gabon Te lecom and Air Gabon. 

23. 

Wh i le the f inanc ia l sector in Gabon i s , in general, prof itab le and stable, ce r ta in s t ruc tu ra l 
features could contr ibute to medium-term-solvency and g row th concerns. Banks dom ina te the 
f inanc ia l sector, and are generally cos t-e f f ic ien t and liquid. Shor t- term bank ing sector risks are tempered 
by a h i g h leve l o f liquidity and adequate access to cen tra l refinancing. However , the ac t iv i t ies and 
po ten t ia l o f commerc ia l banks a re l im i ted by the re la t ive ly sma l l size o f the non -o i l economy at present, 
pa r t icu la r ly g iven the f inanc ing o f the o i l sector i s la rge ly undertaken outside o f the coun try . In addition, 
the bank ing sector i s h igh ly concentrated, w i t h a loan po r t fo l io that i s non-d ivers i f ied6 . At end-February 
2001, three out o f f i v e operating banks did no t meet pruden t ia l ratios on risk d ivers i f ica t ion , leav ing the 
sector as a whole exposed to a sma l l number o f enterprises. The Banks Apr i l 2003 Gabon F inanc ia l 
Sector Assessment (FSA) recommended that banks: (a) d ive rs i fy domes t ica l ly b y entering i n t o 
underserved markets; (b) proceed w i t h cross-border d ivers i f ica t ion ; and (c) syndicate w i t h fo re ign banks. 
A l l o f these trends need to be closely fo l lowed by supervisory authorities. 

24. 

As a CEMAC country, Gabon follows the BEAC regulations wh ich t rea t money launde r ing 
and te r ro r is t financing as c r im ina l offences. On Novembe r 20, 2002, the B E A C Boa rd o f D i rec to rs

T r an sp a r en c y in o i l revenue managemen t has begun t o b e addressed. To he lp address this 

issue, in 1998 the Government passed a law to set up a Fund f o r Future Generations (FFG). Unde r the 
law , the FFG shou ld receive 10 percent o f projected o i l revenues, 50 percent o f “w ind fa l l” revenues (in 
excess o f projections), and accumulated interest, up to a minimum cap i ta l o f C F A F 500 b i l l i o n . The 
Government has been making regu lar deposits to the FFG account in B E A C since 2002, in agreement 
w i t h the IMF. Since January 2005, the deposits have been cred i ted w i t h interest at 1.7 percent. The FFG

Despite these challenges, prospects fo r the med ium t e rm indicate stable, though very 
modest, growth . High pe tro leum prices over the past year have a l lowed the com ing on stream o f 
add i t iona l f ie lds that wou ld have otherwise been considered non-commercial, thus he lp ing to stabilize o i l 
produc t ion f o r a few years. 
Investment i n rubber production, ongoing expansion in the agri-business 
sector, as w e l l investment i n the forest and mining sectors should boost the non -o i l GDP g row th rate f r o m 
about 2.3 percent in 2004 to 3.5 percent on average over the pe r iod 2005 to 2008. The expected gains in 
the non -o i l sectors should somewhat offset the dec l in ing o i l produc t ion ( o i l produc t ion i s expected to 
decline b y about 4.8 percent annually on average between 2004 and 2008), to achieve an average GDP 
g row th rate o f about 1 percent in the per iod 2004 to 2008. The projected elevated prices fo r o i l and

H istor ica l ly , Gabon has bo r rowed extensively to imp lement its expansionist economic 
policies. This approach has l e f t the country w i t h expensive debt and heavy debt-service ratios. W h i l e the 
debt i s manageable over the longer term, high debt-service ra t ios pose a p rob lem in the short run, 
constraining the poss ib i l i ty o f red irec t ing f isca l resources to imp rove pub l ic service de l ivery . M o s t 
external debt i s owed to o f f ic ia l creditors, in par t icu lar to France. Fo r this reason, there i s less risk o f an 
unforeseen increase in the interest cost o f debt, un l ike other m idd le - income countries that raise mos t o f 
the ir f inanc ing in cap i ta l markets.

I n the past two years, Gabon has strengthened i t s overa l l debt management. Due to better 
liquidity management, the country’s payments t o banks and commerc ia l ins t i tu t ions have been regular. 
With the approva l o f the IMF Standby Arrangement, the Paris C lub took note o f the coun try ’s imp roved 
macroeconomic and f isca l performance. In June 2004, i t reached an agreement w i t h the Government o f 
Gabon to reschedule par t o f the country’s external debt. The Paris C lub consolidated around €717 
m i l l i o n , wh ich resulted i n a reduc t ion in debt service to Paris C lub creditors f r om €953 m i l l i o n to €270 
m i l l i o n over the l i f e o f the debt. Because Gabon i s an IBRD country, the debt rescheduling took p lace 
under Paris C lub ’s classic terms, w i t h a l l credits to be repaid progressively over fourteen years, inc lud ing 
three years o f grace. Paris C lub creditors also inc luded a goodw i l l clause, s igna l ing the ir agreement t o 
consider a fur ther restructuring wh ich cou ld inc lude an element o f debt reduction. A t t h i s stage the Paris 
Club creditors do n o t see a need to imp lemen t the g o o dw i l l clause in light o f the improvemen t in the debt 
situation, underp inned b y h i g h o i l prices.

The externa l debt stock o f the country has decreased f r om 63.1 percent o f GDP in 2001 to 50 
percent i n 2004 and i s projected to f a l l fur ther to 42.4 percent i n 2006 (Table 6). The latest debt 
sustainability analysis indicates that t h i s dec l ine i s due to three factors: (a) a less rap id decline in o i l 
receipts due to h igher prices and less rap id ly dec l in ing produc t ion volumes; (b) moderate non -o i l grow th ; 
and (c) continued f isca l adjustment that results in no f inanc ing gaps. The baseline analysis indicates that 
the external debt to GDP ra t io decreases continuously, f inanc ing gaps disappear and the debt service 
ratios peak w i t h i n the nex t f i v e years and dec l ine thereafter. S im i la r ly , Gabon’s to ta l ex terna l debt to 
GDP ra t io i s pro jec ted to decrease to 45.7 percent in 2006 and f a l l to less than one - f i f th o f GD P w i t h i n 
the nex t ten years. One key assumption unde r ly ing this tra jec tory i s the g row th o f non -o i l GDP wh ich i s 
pro jec ted to average 3.5 percent in 2004-2010. At the same time, stress tests revea l that Gabon’s debt 
sustainability continues to be sensitive to shocks in non -o i l g row th (wh ich a f fec t bo th non -o i l exports and 
budget revenues) and to changes in o i l prices, since h igher pro jec ted o i l prices translate i n t o greater ease

( i ) National Development Strategy Objectives 

33. 

The overarch ing goal of Gabon’s nat iona l development strategy i s to generate sustained 
g row th fo r pove r ty reduction. The country’s med ium- term development goals, as described in the I- 
PRSP and the long - te rm v is ion document “Gabon 2025”, a re (1) to foster non -o i l private-sector-led 
growth; and (2) t o strengthen pub l ic sector effectiveness and e f f ic iency . The I-PRSP highlights the 
Government’s comm i tmen t to ensure that the fruits o f t h i s g row th bene f i t the poor more directly, through 
j o b creation in non -o i l sectors. The Government also intends to imp rove the e f f ic iency and equ i ty o f 
public expenditures, specifically to imp rove the qua l i ty o f investments i n education and health. 

34. 

Government’s view of the approach to reduc ing poverty has evolved over time. The ma jo r 
objectives iden t i f ied in the I-PRSP were to: (i) reduce unemployment; (ii) ha l t the r u r a l economic decline; 
(iii) imp rove access to basic social services; ( iv ) strengthen the social safety nets; (v) ensure that the poo r 
have better l i v i n g conditions; (v i) imp rove the pos i t ion o f women in society; and (v i i ) introduce more 
e f f ic ien t governance systems. These objectives and the means to achieve them w i l l be more f u l l y 
developed in the full PRSP. Wh i le i n i t i a l l y the authorities conceived the PRSP as a catalog o f measures 
to fight pover ty d irec t ly , they have now adopted the classic forma t o f the PRSP that includes g row th 
policies. The document i s now re ferred to as the g row th and pover ty reduc t ion strategy paper o r 
Document de strate‘gie de croissance e t de rkduc t ion de l a pauvrete‘ (GPRSP), to emphasize the grow th- 
based pro-poor v is ion of development that the coun try i s pursuing.

A high p ropo r t ion o f school-age ch i ldren (93.5 percent) are enro l led in p r ima ry school, with a gender gap 
o f on ly 2 percent in favor o f males. However , the poo r qua l i ty o f education and high repeater and drop-

7. Ensure environmental 
sustainability and access to 
an improved water source 

In 2000 environment and 
forests are degrading at an 
accelerated speed i n most 
tropical countries and about 
80 % o f the population had 
access to water. 

SSA average was 187 
deaths per 1,000 l ive births 
i n 1990, decreasing to 174 
i n 2002. A t t h i s rate, the 
goal w i l l not be achieved by 
2015. 
There has been no 
significant change from verj 
high maternal mortality 
ratios (917 per 100,000 l ive 
births i n 2000) on average ir 
SSA countries." 

The WHO estimates tha t 
there were 2.3 m i l l ion 
AIDS-related deaths in 2001 
and that the prevalence rate 
has reached 8.4%. 

There i s continued loss o f 
biodiversity. However, loss 
o f forest cover seems to be 
lower in Central Africa than 
in other tropical areas. 
Access to improved water 
source rose from 48.7 % i n 
1990 to 55.4 % in 2000. 

From 1992 to 2000, the under-5 
mortality rate decreased from 155 to 91.4 
per 1,000 live births. If this trend 
continues, Gabon i s on track to achieve 
the goal. 

Despite relatively high access to prenatal 
care for women aged 15 to 49, maternal 
mortality ra te i s s t i l l high in Gabon at 
420 per 100,000 births in 2002. 
However, t h i s represents a significant 
decline from 519 i n 2000. I f t h i s decline 
continues, Gabon appears to be on track 
to achieve the goal b v 2015. 
O f f ic ia l prevalence o f H IV /A IDS among 
adults aged 15-49 increased from 2.8 % 
i n 1991 to 8.1 % i n 2003. 
55% o f children under one year have 
been immunized against measles. 
Estimated cases o f malaria per 100,000 
oeoole were 2,148 in 2000. 
Deforestation rate i s lower than in most 
parts o f Central Africa. Three millions 
hectares o f production forest are in the 
process o f coming under sustainable 
management. Status o f fisheries 
resources i s uncertain. Access to an 
improved water source rose from 67 % 
i n 1995 to 86 % in 2000. 

37 . With respect to env ironmenta l sustainability and access to potable water , Gabon faces new 
challenges. L o w popu la t ion density in Gabon’s h in ter land makes i t more l i k e l y t o preserve b iod ive rs i ty 
than in mos t other trop ica l countries. However , s ign i f ican t commerc ia l poaching takes p lace in 
connection w i t h indus tr ia l logg ing . The f ish ing industry i s poo r ly monitored, and fish stocks are 
uncertain. Surface water resources are re la t ive ly abundant; however, recent problems in the supply and 
d is t r ibu t ion o f potable water to urban centers and deteriorating sanitation conditions have g iven r ise to 
s ign i f ican t hea l th concerns. 

38. 

H IV /A IDS and other diseases a re o f concern. The H IV prevalence rate in Gabon i s estimated 
at over 8 percent i n 2003, w i t h the tw o ma jo r urban centers repor t ing even h igher prevalence rates, 
especially among the produc t ive age group o f 25 to 39. The Government i s w e l l aware o f the increasing 
urgency o f the p rob lem and has begun wo rk ing on a Na t iona l Strategy fo r H I V / A I D S preven t ion and 
con tro l . The coun try received US$3.15 m i l l i o n f r om the G loba l Fund to address the a larm ing progression 
o f the HIV/AIDS epidemic and to reduce i t s impac t on the general population, and in par t icu lar on groups 
in a vulnerable situation. Prevention campaigns have also been imp lemen ted w i t h the support o f 
UNAIDS. Other diseases such as ma la r ia and tuberculosis are also prevalent in Gabon, as w e l l as 
occasional outbreaks o f Typho id and Ebo la . 

39 . 

Gabon can contribute re lat ive ly l i t t le to the global effort towards the M i l l e n n i um 
Development Goals, bo th because o f i t s sma l l popu la t ion and because i t has large ly succeeded in 
addressing the most extreme characteristics o f pover ty as seen in a g loba l perspective. The pover ty 
challenges fac ing Gabon today are addressing severe economic inequalities, generating more bene f i ts 
f r om non -o i l na tura l resources and ensuring the ir equitable distribution, ensuring sustainability o f the 
resource base, f ind ing produc t ive emp loymen t fo r the poor and non-poor alike, and imp rov ing the qua l i ty 
o f basic services, wh i le enhancing the access o f the poor through targeted red is tr ibu t ion o f resources 
w i t h i n ex is t ing programs and budgets. Con t inued progress i n mee t ing the challenge o f H I V / A I D S w i l l

B. K e y Development Challenges 

40. 

Gabon faces two m a i n challenges in o rde r to reduce poverty, imp rove governance, and 
foster economic growth. These challenges are: (i) imp rov ing e f f ic iency and equ i ty in the use o f pub l ic 
resources, b o t h na tura l and f inanc ia l ; and (ii) d ive rs i fy ing the economy b y imp rov ing the investment 
climate, inc lud ing infrastructure, fo r p r iva te sector development. A cross-cutting theme i s better 
governance, through imp roved transparency and accoun tab i l i ty in the use o f pub l ic resources and in basic 
service de l ivery mechanisms. The p lanned assistance p rog ram o f the W o r l d Bank G roup has been set up 
in order to assist the Government in addressing these challenges. 

( i ) Improving Efficiency and Equity in Public Resources Management 

41. 

Imp rov ing delivery o f social services to a l l households i s a key med ium - te rm challenge 
facing the Gabonese authorities. The success o f the Government’s e f fo r t to achieve the M i l l e n n i um 
Deve lopmen t Goals (MDGs) depends on the a l loca t ion o f increas ing ly scarce resources to support 
improvements in human cap i ta l and the de l ive ry o f soc ia l services. The GPRSP, to be comp le ted in 2005,

L o w budget execution, pa r t icu la r ly w i th rega rd to the investment budget, has hampered the 
effectiveness o f pub l ic spending. Despite re la t ive ly s ign i f ican t budget resources earmarked fo r hea l th 
( fo r example, Gabon budgets about 3.6 percent o f GDP on health), poor management and cash f l o w 
problems have constrained the execution o f programs aimed at combating diseases and achieving the 
MDG hea l th outcomes. This explains pa r t ly why Gabon, although a re la t ive ly wea l thy country, has social 
indicators s im i lar t o lowe r income countries (Gabon i s ranked 122 in the wo r ld according to the Human 
Deve lopmen t Index) . The vaccination rate, fo r example, dropped steadily in the la t ter h a l f o f the 1990s: 
i n 1996, the percentage o f ch i ldren immun ized against D P T was estimated at 62 percent, but by 2001 i t 
had decreased to 38 percent."

Since 2002, Gabon has begun undertak ing reforms to strengthen the impact o f pub l ic 
spending, unde r the guidance o f the Fund and the Bank . Some o f these re forms have attempted to 
restructure budget procedures i n order to strengthen the programmatic links between the budget and the 
Government's pove r ty reduc t ion objectives. Fo r instance, in 2003, the Government in troduced p rog ram 
budgets and in i t ia ted the development o f a med ium- term expenditure framework (MTEF). The med ium - 
term p rog ram i s a imed at sustaining f isca l adjustment and boos t ing non -o i l sectors' g row th and pover ty 
reduc t ion potential. A pub l ic expenditure rev iew exercise, supported by several development partners, 
has recen t ly begun and i s designed t o support government e f for ts to imp rove pub l ic resources 
management and t o p rov ide input in to the GPRSP. I t w i l l p rov ide an ove ra l l diagnosis o f pub l ic f inanc ia l 
management issues and address key elements o f budget preparation and execution.

Gabon lacks t ime ly and re l iab le statistics, and needs to develop statistical capacity in o rde r 
to measure progress in achieving results. T ime ly and re l iab le statistics are key inputs t o the results 
management process. L a c k o f re l iab le data in Gabon affects the authorities' ab i l i ty to formu la te po l ic ies 
based on so l id ana ly t ica l wo rk and to mon i to r or evaluate development programs. The Bank's ab i l i ty to 
o f fe r mean ing fu l po l icy advice i s also constrained b y the pauc i ty o f data. The ongo ing preparation o f the 
GPRSP has drawn attention to the de f ic ien t statistical base. The 1993 household budget and consumption 
survey prov ides the mos t recent data available fo r ana ly t ica l wo rk on pover ty . Results o f the 2003 Census 
o f Popu la t ion and Hous ing are yet to be published. The sampling frame fo r the most recent data on soc ia l 
indicators, t h e hea l th and demographic survey (2002)' was based on the 1993 census (i.e. outdated census

Improving the Investment Environment for Private Sector Development 

45. 

To reduce the country's heavy dependence o n oil, Gabon needs to jumps ta r t private-sector- 
led diversification. T o foster economic development and increase employment, non -o i l na tura l resources 
need to contribute more s ign i f ican t ly to the GDP, through imp roved pub l ic sector management and 
increased pr iva te sector investment in these sectors. The Government i s aware that measures need to be 
taken to imp rove the investment c l ima te and attract investment in the non -o i l sectors. The Fo re ign 
Investment Adv iso ry Services (FIAS), a j o i n t service o f the Bank and the IFC , recen t ly completed a 
diagnostic study o f the investment c l ima te in Gabon (see B o x 1). I t iden t i f ied several areas in need o f 
attention: (i) imp rov ing governance and the ru le o f law ; (ii) imp rov ing investment-related adm in is tra t ive 
procedures; (iii) re fo rm ing the tax system; ( iv) im p r o v i n g infrastructure; and (v) reduc ing the costs o f

T h e inefficient functioning o f the law and justice sector represents a ma jo r imped iment to 
p r iva te sector development in Gabon. There i s a consensus among relevant stakeholders regard ing the 
need t o inves t adequate resources in t h i s sector to promote the ru le o f l aw bo th as a matter o f general 
concern and a means to enhance business and investment c l ima te in Gabon. 

47. 

Gabon’s strategy in the non-o i l sectors i s d ifferent f r om those o f its neighbors. U n l i k e most 
Sub-Saharan A f r ican countries, Gabon does no t depend very much on agr icu l tura l exports. Rather, i t s 
strategy i s t o become a base f o r in terna t iona l services, especially those needed by the pe tro leum industry, 
wh i le developing natural-resource-related transformation industries and tourism. 
I f t h i s strategy i s 
successful, Gabon cou ld become an impor tan t economic partner fo r i t s neighbors as w e l l as f o r the 
in terna t iona l commun i ty . I t s co l labora t ion w i th in the Congo Bas in In i t ia t ive on the T r i -Na t iona l Park i s 
one example o f such partnership in the area o f tourism, wh ich invo lves j o i n t e f for ts by the three park 
agencies concerned. such as coherent land use p lann ing across borders, harmon iza t ion o f procedures and 
regulations, j o i n t awareness raising and consultations processes. j o i n t surveillance and other l a w 
enforcement activities, and setting up j o i n t p lann ing and mon i to r ing and evaluation systems. 

48. 

Forestry , current ly the second-largest sector in terms o f j o b creat ion a f te r the pub l ic sector, 
has significantly greater potential to contribute to economic development. Gabon has 22.5 hectares 
o f forest per capita, one o f the highest ratios in the wor ld . However, the sector’s con tr ibu t ion to the 
na t iona l economy remains be low i t s po ten t ia l in terms o f employment. revenues and commun i ty 
development. The t imber indus try today provides about 7,000 d irec t jobs, whereas i t cou ld probab ly 
p rov ide tw ice as much employment in related transformation and transport services, w i thou t increasing 
the l e v e l o f harvesting. The challenge f o r Gabon i s to increase forest-based bene f i ts fo r the popu la t ion 
wh i le ma in ta in ing t imber harvesting at a sustainable level, in accordance w i t h forest management plans. 
Greater transparency and law enforcement i s needed at a l l steps o f the sequence to foster accoun tab i l i ty 
and reduce the r o om fo r corrup t ion and arb i trary decisions. This requires remov ing po l icy and 
governance bottlenecks that have hampered sector performance during the las t fou r decades. 

49. 

S t r ik ing progress in forest sector r e f o rm marks a significant b r e a k f r om the past. Over the 
recent past, the Government has taken b o l d and concrete steps to imp rove transparency and e f f ic iency in 
the fores try sector. H igh l igh ts o f the recent re forms inc lude notably: (i) passing a new Forest Code in 
2001; (ii) creating 13 na t iona l parks wh ich to ta l ten percent o f Gabon’s to ta l surface areal2 in 2002; (iii) 
s imp l i fy ing the f isca l reg ime

( iv ) approv ing a letter o f

(v) 
enacting a decree establishing

January 2006; and (v i i) disclosing the l i s t o f logg ing and non-comp l ian t perm i ts in the loca l newspaper

o f the sector wh ich was characterized by a lack o f transparency, interference b y vested interests, and 
distortions in the incen t ive framework. These are impor tan t first steps that need to be fo l lowed with 
fur ther re forms in the same direction.

T h e recent reforms create a unique window o f opportun ity to deepen forest sector re fo rms 

and ensure the i r sustainability. The re fo rm agenda in the forest sector, as described in the M a y 2004 
le t ter o f development po l icy , i s far reaching and includes p rov is ion fo r development o f par t ic ipa tory 
forest zoning, mon i to r ing o f sustainable management plans and o f i l lega l logg ing , development o f 
commun i ty forestry, retrocession o f a share o f revenues to loca l entities, and the development o f non- 
extractive uses o f forests. Through f isca l incentives the Government i s also encouraging the expansion o f 
domestic processing in terms o f bo th quan t i ty and quality.13 Remova l o f the SNBG export monopo ly w i l l 
remove marke t d is tor t ions and increase the sector’s competitiveness. The planned Bank support fo r the 
forest re fo rm agenda (see B o x 2) w i l l be cruc ia l to ensure the momen tum i s no t lost. 

Box 2. Past and Planned Bank Involvement in Forest and Environment in Gabon 

The Bank’s Forest and Environment Project (PFE) la id the early groundwork for improved management 
o f Gabon’s forest and environmental resources. Approved in 1992, the project closed in 2002. In the interval 
since the PFE closed in 2002, policy dialogue has developed and gathered momentum through the preparation by 
the Government o f a National Forest and Environment Sector Program (PSFE) in coordination w i th a l l interested 
donors, private sector and c iv i l society. 

Gabon has significantly expanded i t s protected areas network, which now covers more than 10 percent 
o f t h e nation’s surface area, including marine ecosystems, and i s setting up an autonomous agency for national 
park management. In 2004, Gabon’s Council o f M i n i s t e r s adopted a Le t ter o f Sector Policy on natural resources 
management, including forests, fisheries, biodiversity protection and environmental management. This po l icy 
aims at promoting employment, revenues, rural development and increased entrepreneurship while protecting 
natural ecosystems and biodiversity. Later in 2004, the Government confirmed i t s commitment to greater 
transparency in managing t h e forest sector by establishing a moratorium on sole-source attribution o f logging 
permits. In December 2004, the Government decided to remove t h e monopoly o f t h e National Timber 
Marketing Company (SNBG), starting January 2006, so as to liberalize t h e timber trade. These reforms 
represent a striking departure from the long-standing climate o f opacity, discretion and distorted incentives. 
These are f i s t steps which should be followed by fu r the r reforms in t h e same direction. 

Through t h e two planned Natural Resources Development Policy Loans and a planned Grant from the 
Global Environment Facility, the Bank intends to support the implementation o f Gabon’s PSFE program in 
synergy w i th other development partners (France, EU, US, A fDB among others). Bank and other donor support 
w i l l help capitalize on the very significant recent Government reforms to ensure that they take hold and are 
deepened. The PSFE program w i l l also provide unique opportunities to involve the Bank and other partners in 
the reform process that i s also starting to emerge in the fisheries and mining sectors. By l ink ing lending to the 
implementation o f reforms, t h e planned operations w i l l strengthen the voice o f reformers and increase their 
capacity to overcome resistance from vested interests. The two-staged DPL approach w i l l also mitigate against 
the loss o f momentum in the reform process.

Gabon has impo r tan t geological reserves and a long history o f mining, especially of 

manganese and u ran ium . However , compared t o other countries w i t h s i m i l a r m ine ra l endowments, the 
con tr ibu t ion o f the mining sector to the country’s wea l th has rema ined re la t ive ly small. Besides 
manganese, o f wh ich Gabon i s the wor ld ’s th i rd largest producer, mining ac t iv i t ies a re res tr ic ted to 
artisanal produc t ion o f g o l d and diamonds and, to a lesser extent, excavation o f construction material. 
Gabon i s considered to have good mining po ten t ia l and several m ine ra l deposits have been iden t i f ied over 
the years such as: go ld (w i t h a number o f h i g h grade sma l l deposits iden t i f ied in 11 regions in Gabon), 
i r o n ore, and co lumb ium , along w i t h several other minerals. The mining po ten t ia l o f the coun try i s no t 
re f lec ted in i t s current mining output. Po ten t ia l mining ou tpu t i s estimated to be capable o f generating 
about US$300 to US$400 m i l l i o n annua l ly in revenues in the l o n g te rm i f a favorable inves tmen t

impor tance o f addressing artisanal m in ing ac t iv i t ies (diamonds) and imp rov ing env ironmen ta l

Fisheries also represent a potent ia l g row th sector. At over 40 kg per capita Gabon’s fish 
consump t ion i s among the highest in A f r ica . Recorded fish produc t ion in 2004 was 45,000 me t r ic tons o f 
wh ich over 70 percent i s produced b y artisanal fishers. In t e rm s o f b io log ica l po ten t ia l the annual y i e l d o f 
the fisheries has been estimated at 230,000 tons, but re l iab le estimates o f the sustainable leve l o f 
produc t ion have n o t been made and despite a recent prom is ing survey o f deeper waters, the resource base 
i s p o o r l y known . Non-Gabonese nationals constitute 80 percent o f the sector’s labor force wh ich 
complicates stakeholder engagement. Weak sector governance, ine f fec t ive mon i to r ing and con t ro l and 
lack o f transparency in l icens ing contribute to the absence o f a clear v is ion fo r the fu ture o f the sector. 
Gabon sees the development o f t h i s sector as an alternative source o f food fo r the loca l popu la t ion and a 
po ten t ia l revenue earner. On-shore fishing b y commun i t ies and fam i l ies can probab ly imp rove food 
security and increase cash income fo r poor commun i t ies and households. W i t h regard to indus t r ia l o f f - 
shore fishing, the ma rg in o f improvement probab ly resides more in p rov id ing Government w i t h 
sustainable revenues that can then be allocated to imp roved social service p rov is ion through pub l ic 
expenditures. 

53 . 

T h e cu r ren t transport situation hinders the development o f productive sectors, pa r t icu la r ly 
in the rural h inter land . Gabon has 9,170 k i lome ters o f roads, o f wh ich on ly 10 percent are paved. The 
two p lanned ma in axes connecting nor th to south and east to west are no t completed. Par t o f the east-west 
axis i s connected b y an o l d and dilapidated ra i lway system. Development o f a new roads system i s 
d i f f i c u l t to justify econom ica l ly g iven the very l o w popu la t ion density and l o w economic ac t iv i ty in the 
r u r a l areas and on the other side o f the borders. The so lu t ion more favored by deve lop ing partners mos t 
active in the transport sector, inc lud ing EU, the AfDB and AFD, i s to rehab i l i ta te ex is t ing p r i o r i t y 
ne tworks and to ensure that adequate pub l ic f inanc ing i s available fo r the ir maintenance. The ra i l road 
concession, wh ich was suspended fo l low ing a dispute w i t h the operator and i s curren t ly func t ion ing under 
temporary arrangements, w i l l have to be renewed under mo re f inanc ia l ly v iab le terms and conditions.

Tou r ism has a h igh potent ia l in this country tha t i s part of one o f the largest ra inforest

I t s forests 
be long to the Congo Bas in t rop ica l rainforest ecosystem, the wor ld ’s second largest area o f contiguous

new tax incentives to promo te high-value, low -vo lume tourism, g row th has been slow. A i r fa res to 
Europe and the U S rema in expensive, tour ism-re la ted in fras truc ture and services are inadequate and 
costly, and bo th Government and p r iva te sector have fa i led to embark on a serious sector g row th strategy.

Box 3. P i lo t Community Infrastructure .Works and Capacity Building Project 

The P i lo t Community Infrastructure Works and Capacity Building Project (Learning and 
Innova t ion 
Loan) provided a practical test o f approaches adopted in the Urban Sector Strategy developed under 
the earlier 
Transport Sector technical Assistance project (approved in FY95 and closed in €9’00). 
I t was 
designed to tes t new methods f o r bu i ld ing community-based infrastructure and prov id ing support for l o c a l 
contractors. The goal was to improve l i v i n g conditions in selected poor urban neighborhoods in a sustainable 
way and w i t h substantial community participation. The project also aimed at bu i ld ing loca l capacity to 
undertake a larger program o f community based-public works. 
Despite i t s s m a l l size, the project was perceived b y i t s stakeholders as the most concrete and practical 
way to address the poverty issue in Gabon. This project has allowed fo r t h e de f in i t ion o f appropriate approaches 
and modus operandi for “soft” and community-based upgrading o f low-income settlements as opposed to heavy 
restructuring. Rather than starting w i t h heavy land restructuring and regularization and major infrastructure 
change that wou ld have dramatically raised land values and upset t h e social composition o f the targeted 
settlements, the infrastructure upgrading e f for t focused on adapted improvements to existing main access and 
t r a n s i t roads. The objective was to facilitate physical access to services (such as transportation, f i r e crews, 
ambulances) and improve sanitation and drainage in the targeted areas. In additiqn, and w i t h technical support 
provided b y PAPSUT through the municipalities, the recipient communities put together community-based 
micro-projects centered around the already improved access and t r a n s i t road through their neighborhoods. As a 
result, micro-projects (essentially water, sanitation, and drainage facilities and pedestrian paths to the main 
t r a n s i t roads) were identified in the targeted neighborhoods and implemented w i t h the effective contribution o f 
municipalities and communities. 
A l l works included in the project were carried out b y loca l entrepreneurs selected after open 
competitive b idd ing and without noticeable cost overruns. These works apparently have been the on ly ones 
included in the national PIP actually procured through open and competitive bidding. The technology used f o r 
access and t r a n s i t road pavement (cement blocks) turned out to be t h e most appropriate to facilitate involvement 
o f loca l SMEs in the infrastructure upgrading process. 
For the f i r s t t ime in Gabon, municipalities were invo lved in road paving projects. They learned how t o 
procure these works and participated w i t h community leaders in the design and implementation o f m icro- 
projects. As the methodology was developed, manuals were prepared, and training was performed on the project 
sites. This early experience was then used to train loca l government s t a f f on the job , creating technical units in 
the municipalities and invo lv ing them in project implementation. The project also trained professionals to he lp 
communities select the works to be performed, mob i l ize community contributions, and explain work procedures. 
A methodology fo r community participation was developed, tested, and improved. This process, although time- 
consuming, now provides t h e basis f o r larger future initiatives. A s i m i l a r learning-by-doing process was used t o 
extract lessons f rom the early involvement o f SMEs and design and provide training f o r young entrepreneurs in 
procurement and other management s k i l l s . 
A few months before i t s closure on June 30, 2004, the project was discussed and evaluated openly at a 
national workshop that included representatives f r om a l l relevant l i n e m i n i s t r i e s , loca l governments, t h e loca l 
private sector, and c i v i l society. The participants in the workshop praised the project’s achievements and 
requested that the in i t ia t ive be expanded, in terms o f bo th sector coverage (social infrastructure in hea l th and 
education, transport and municipal facilities) and geographical coverage (urban and rural areas).

( i i i ) Governance and Participation 

57 . 

E f f ic ien t and transparent management o f pub l ic finances has been an ongoing challenge to 
the Government and the donor community. Annua l budgets are formu la ted and approved, but o f f - l ine 
expenditures arranged through unorthodox procedures o f ten preclude e f fec t ive execution o f the budget. 
These problems are w e l l recognized b y c i v i l servants who are constrained in the ir ab i l i ty to run the ir 
programs, but are powerless to con t ro l the budgetary process. The c ircu la t ion o f in fo rma t ion i s highly 
restricted bo th within and outside the Government. As a result, there i s l i t t l e confidence w i t h i n the 
pr iva te sector, and h i g h costs are attached to any government transaction. Unde r the Bank-supported 
Pr iva t iza t ion P ro jec t approved in 1997 and closed in June 2004, the Government began to gain experience 
w i t h more transparent procedures and to understand better w h y poor governance cou ld constitute an 
obstacle to p r iva te investment.

M o r e t ime ly dissemination o f statistics w i l l help strengthen governance. In order t o imp rove 
f isca l transparency, the Gabonese authorities have made a s ign i f ican t e f fo r t to ensure the proper f l o w o f 
f isca l in fo rma t ion to the pub l ic b y mak ing available ( through the Finance M in is t ry ’s statistical unit) a 
comprehensive database on f isca l ac t iv i ty . M o r e t ime ly pub l ica t ion o f such in fo rma t ion i s necessary,

Gabon has made significant progress towa rd l ibera l izat ion o f the economy, but challenges 
rema in . A l though the agenda i s no t yet complete, there has recen t ly been v is ib ly increasing comm i tmen t 
to imp rove the business c l ima te and imp lemen t a re fo rm agenda in key sectors such as fores try and 
m in ing . However , several issues rema in to be tackled. F o r example, e f f ic ien t and transparent p r ic ing 
mechanisms f o r na tura l resources and related tax co l lec t ion n ow need to be implemented, in order to 
a l low fo r an adequate sharing o f the rent. In the past, forest revenues have been poo r ly co l lec ted and non- 
comp l ian t companies no t sanctioned, wh ich discourages responsible investors. On-go ing re forms in the 
forest sector, wh ich focus on transparency in concession a l loca t ion and on l a w enforcement, w i l l establish 
a more leve l p lay ing f i e l d fo r responsible investors. 

60 . 

The combination o f declining revenues and the need to a t t rac t mo re p r iva te investment 
provides a powe r fu l incentive fo r Government to imp rove transparency and efficiency in the use o f 
pub l ic resources, bo th natural and financial. In spite o f con t inued resistance f r om vested interests, 
there i s g row ing recogn i t ion among pub l ic authorities that resources need to be directed more e f f ic ien t ly 
to imp rove basic service delivery, and that new resources cou ld be developed through economic 
d ivers i f ica t ion . At the express request o f the President, the Government has declared i t s in ten t ion to 
imp lemen t the Ex trac t ive Industries Transparency In i t ia t ive (EITI) and has asked fo r Bank support in t h i s 
area (see B o x 4). This comm i tmen t to imp rov ing the transparency o f revenues der ived f r om extractive 
industries provides a clear ind ica t ion o f support fo r the agenda o f imp roved transparency and governance. 
I t i s also a signal o f Government’s g row ing comm i tmen t t o increase transparency in the management o f

The EITI aims at increasing transparency w i t h respect to payments made to the Government b y oil, gas 
and m in ing companies. A t the E I T I second annual conference held in London on Ma rch 17,2005, participants 
in the In i t ia t ive endorsed the fo l low ing criteria for implementation: 
Regular pub l ica t ion o f all material oil, gas and m in ing payments b y companies to governments 
(“payments”) and all material revenues received b y governments f rom oil, gas, and m in ing companies 
(“revenues”) 
to a wide audience in a pub l ic ly accessible, comprehensive and comprehensible manner; 
Where such audits do not already exist, payments and revenues are the subject o f a credible, independent 
audit, app ly ing international auditing standards; 
Payments and revenues are reconciled b y a credible, independent administrator, applying international 
auditing standards and w i t h publication o f the administrator’s opinion regarding reconciliation inc lud ing 
discrepancies, should any be identified; 
This approach i s extended to all companies inc lud ing state-owned enterprises; 
C i v i l society i s actively engaged as a participant in the design, monitoring and evaluation o f t h i s process 
and contributes towards public debate; 
A public, financially sustainable work plan fo r all the above i s developed b y the host government, w i t h 
assistance f r om the international financial institutions where required, inc lud ing measurable targets, a 
timetable f o r implementation, and an assessment o f potential capacity constraints. 
Implementing countries are encouraged to exceed these criteria where possible, in l i n e w i t h t h e 
principles o f the IMF Code o f Good Practices on F i s c a l Transparency and the good practice examples in the 
accompanying Manual on Fiscal Transparency. 
A preliminary needs assessment and a diagnostic o f revenue flows and institutional responsibility f o r 
assessment and collection o f extractive industry revenues have been carried out b y the Bank w i t h respect to the 
hydrocarbon and mining sectors. Further to t h i s initial assessment, a road map fo r implementation o f the EITI 
has been prepared. An inter-ministerial committee entrusted w i t h the coordination o f t h e EITI implementation, 
the EITI W o r k Group, was created b y m i n i s t e r i a l decree February 24, 2005. The EITI Wo rk Group i s currently 
de f in ing a detailed action plan and responsibility fo r implementation. 
C i v i l Society plays an important ro le in ensuring that h i g h standards in transparency and accountability 
in pub l ic l i f e , government operations and business are applied. T o t h i s end, the creation o f a Stakeholders’ 
Group composed o f c i v i l society representative, industry representatives and government i s envisaged t o 
facilitate pub l ic debate over measures to enhance transparency in t h e extractive industry. This w i l l ensure that 
a l l necessary reforms are introduced after due consultation, wh ich w i l l facilitate their understanding and 
acceptance. Participation in the Stakeholders’ Group i s voluntary and non-binding. 
Wh i le the involvement o f the industry representatives does no t present too many difficulties, t h e 
establishment o f the c i v i l society component o f the stakeholders group poses some challenges. There are few 
non-governmental organizations in Gabon, familiar w i t h the complexities o f the hydrocarbon sector. The 
Government i s envisaging actions to improve c i v i l society understanding o f the Extractive Industry and to 
strengthen t h e i r ab i l i ty to actively participate in i t s implementation. As an in te r im measure, the Government’s 
advisory body, Conseil Economique et Social (a consultative body comprised o f government, private sector and 
c i v i l society representatives) i s being considered to represent c i v i l society in the stakeholder group.

C iv i l society does not yet p lay an effective role in shaping, implementing and overseeing

Box 5. Capacity Development for Civil Society 

Challenges: Many challenges hinder the effectiveness o f Gabonese c i v i l society as a development partner: 
Mos t C i v i l Society Organizations (CSOs) in Gabon lack funding and equipment, have no permanent s t a f f or 
headquarters, and receive l i t t l e donor assistance. 
Many organizations lack s k i l l s in project conception and implementation. They also often need to improve the 
transparency o f the i r management. 
There i s a lack o f associative culture in t h e country. People do no t readily mob i l ize beh ind an associative 
structure, and membership fees are difficult to collect. Often, on ly the President and a small nucleus o f people 
run the organization. 
The c i v i l society movement i s strongly politicized. Very often, organizations are created by Government 
o f f ic ia ls or other parties w i t h po l i t ica l interests. This creates suspicion w i t h i n c i v i l society i tse l f as w e l l as on 
the part o f the Govemment and development partners. 
Consequently, there i s a lack o f dialogue and collaboration between t h e different structures o f c i v i l society. 
Coordinating structures are no t representative and often overlap one another. 
The Conseil Economique et Social, a council composed o f h igh- leve l representatives f r om different sectors o f 
society in charge o f advising the Government, has not been f u l l y effective in promo t ing c i v i l society 
participation. 
Many o f these non-state actors lack a long- term vision o f their ro le in Gabon’s development. Often the i r 
activities lack cohesion w i t h t h e i r set objectives. Many organizations change t h e i r programs according to 
circumstances (new elections, availability o f funds, intemational fo rum dealing w i t h a specific issue). Such 
opportunism once more undermines their credibility. 
There i s reticence on part o f the State to accept c i v i l society as a real partner o f development. 
Bank Response: Consultations fo r the 2005-2008 CAS stressed t h e importance o f Bank involvement in c i v i l 
society capacity development. The Bank plans to pursue t h i s objective through the fo l low ing avenues, w i t h the help 
o f Country O f f ice resources and an IDF grant and/or a W B I training program. 
Systematically invo lve c i v i l society in the design, implementation, and evaluation o f Bank-led programs. 
Undertake an extensive outreach campaign (through bulletins, conferences, the Public In forma t ion Center) so as 
to present Bank procedures and activities and gather in forma t ion o n c i v i l society organizations throughout the 
country (their objectives, interests and capacities). 
Encourage the Govemment to invo lve c i v i l society actors in the conception, execution and mon i tor ing o f public 
programs and to establish a regulatory framework to guide government interaction w i t h c i v i l society. The 
GPRSP preparation and implementation process provides an important venue f o r collaboration between c i v i l 
society and the Government. 
Provide or f i a n c e training programs in project conception and execution, f inanc ia l management, activity 
reporting, leadership, communication and cross-cutting issues. 
Promote c i v i l society collaboration through setting up fora, activities and networks where different 
organizations can meet and discuss strategies to enhance the i r cred ib i l i ty and influence in shaping public 
policies. Establish a dialogue with, and support, existing coordinating structures w i t h i n c i v i l society (NGO 
networks and platforms) as w e l l as w i t h i n the Government and invo lve t h e Conseil Economique et Social. 
Support and Coordinate actions f o r c i v i l society capacity-building undertaken b y other development partners.

T h e 1998 C A S embraced an ambitious agenda fo r po l it ica l and social re fo rm , inc lud ing 

s ign i f ican t a t ten t ion to pover ty alleviation. A Comp le t ion Report fo r the 1998 CAS (CASCR) was 
prepared in June 2004 (Annex 4). CAS performance i s rated as moderately unsatisfactory. The 1998 
coun try assistance program was relevant to broad na t iona l goals, b u t was no t w e l l a l igned w i t h 
government v iews about h ow to achieve those goals. The coun try did no t make acceptable progress 
towards a ma jo r i ty o f the C A S outcomes, a l though i t did make progress on p r iva t iza t ion and some 
progress on macroeconomic management and capacity development. The CAS expectations were 
probab ly unrea l is t ic under the best o f circumstances, pa r t icu la r ly in the area o f pover ty a l lev ia t ion . 
Furthermore, the resources available to the coun try team were too l im i t e d to p rov ide a l l the non- lend ing 
support foreseen in the CAS .

Three key observations can be drawn from the CASCR: 
Gabon’s future depends on i t s capacity to better use i t s natural resource endowment 
Bank needs to remain present, maintain candid dialogue, and ensure wide dissemination and

P re l im ina ry results o f the client survey tha t was ca r r ied out in connection w i th this CAS

Box 7. 2004-2005 Client Survey 

Results o f the client survey carr ied out in Gabon in December 2004-January 2005 showed clients and 
partners wou ld l i k e the Bank to be more visible, more active in the social sectors, and more diversified in i t s 
investments. The survey sample included 300 clients who received written questionnaires and 30 personal 
interviews, The interviews included members o f Parliament, other development partners, representatives o f the 
private sector and c i v i l society, and loca l authorities. Overall t h e client survey was welcomed b y the respondents 
as a signal that the Bank might be w i l l i n g to consult on and consider changes in i t s activities in Gabon. 
Preliminary resu l ts indicate that the image o f the Bank in Gabon i s rather negative. I t s mission o f poverty 
reduction i s no t w e l l communicated or understood b y the clients. They f e e l that the Bank does no t make adequate 
use o f the media and, when organizing in forma t ion sessions, does not include a l l o f i t s partners and clients. I t i s 
believed that the interests o f the Bank and the Govemment are no t the same and that the Bank imposes i t s v is ion o f 
development o n Govemment. The clients also believe that the Govemment does no t really have a poverty 
reduction strategy nor does i t have a clear view of i t s ow n development goals and priorities. 
According to clients, the Bank has no t succeeded in establishing effective development partnerships. 
W h i l e they recognize the achievement o f a few m icro projects, donor coordination i s seen as insufficient, 
particularly on co-financed projects. However, recent efforts to diversify Bank partnerships and activities, to 
finance micro-projects in other parts o f Gabon w i t h the participation o f the loca l authorities and s m a l l enterprises, 
demonstrate that the Bank i s making progress in these areas. 
Clients had many suggestions to make regarding capacity development activities that cou ld be undertaken 
b y the Bank. The Bank should have a clear po l icy on t h i s matter, a l low ing each sector to define i t s ow n needs and 
training program. The Bank should offer more seminars f o r the administration, NGOs, universities, loca l 
authorities, unions, associations, you th and women. The Bank should also encourage the Govemment to iden t i fy 
and use existing loca l capacity. There was a clear interest in NT ICs (New Technologies fo r In forma t ion and 
Communication), a subject to wh ich loca l c l ien ts fe l t they cou ld contribute. 
Clients acknowledged that Bank communications have greatly improved in the recent past. However, they 
are skeptical about the Bank’s new client orientation since they do no t have much so l id in forma t ion about t h e 
Bank‘s work program. The Bank i s s t i l l believed to operate according to rigid policies and procedures. Bank 
procurement, disbursement, and audit r u l e s are no t k n ow n to the clients. These rules are believed to be complex, 
d i f f icu l t to interpret, and unrealistic in the context o f Gabon. Clients also believe that the competence o f loca l 
consultants i s no t sufficiently recognized b y the Bank. M o r e pub l ic in forma t ion on t h i s subject wou ld be 
appreciated. 
Clients welcomed the improved relations w i t h other development partners and Bank support f o r 
community micro-projects. However, they fe l t that the Bank s t i l l has no t established good relations w i t h the large 
enterprises o f the private sector. Bank priorities are no t seen as addressing the most important development issues . 
This i s a perception the Bank w i l l seek to rec t i fy in i t s outreach activities.

66. OED has not conducted a Coun t ry Assistance Strategy Eva lua t ion fo r Gabon . 
Imp lemen ta t ion Comp le t ion Reports fo r three completed projects have been evaluated b y O E D in the last 
f i v e years (Transport Sector Techn ica l Assistance, Fo res t ryEnv i ronmen t and the U rban LIL). The 
ove ra l l performance fo r a l l three was rated Satisfactory or Modera te ly Satisfactory. 

( i i i ) 

Portfolio Management 

67. 

Portfo l io performance, while generally satisfactory, has been uneven. Typ ica l ly , p ro jec t 
imp lemen ta t ion has taken longer than expected, w i t h an average o f approximately 6 years. Some projects 
were slow to start because after a long pe r iod w i thou t Bank invo lvemen t in the sector, pro jec t staff was 
un fam i l ia r w i t h Bank procedures. T ime ly ava i lab i l i ty o f counterpart funding has been an issue, and the 
need fo r close con t ro l o f procurement ac t iv i t ies has also delayed disbursements. In the case o f the 
Fo res t ryEnv i ronmen t Project, the 1993 devaluation doubled the funds available (and the requirements fo r 
loca l counterpart funds), con t r ibu t ing to delays in implementation. The Pr iva t iza t ion Pro jec t and the 
U rban LIL closed i n June 2004, w i t h a satisfactory performance ra t ing fo r the U rban LIL. Curren t ly there 
i s no W o r l d Bank Group ac t ive lend ing po r t fo l io in Gabon, except fo r IFC’s exposure o f US$3.8 m i l l ion . 

68. 

New country financing parameters were approved in April 2005, wh ich prov ide fo r 
increased f lex ib i l ity in the treatment o f cost sharing, taxes, recu r ren t costs, and loca l costs (see 
Annex 6). This f lex ib i l i ty w i l l enable f inanc ing o f loca l costs o f investment projects in amounts 
appropriate f o r achieving pro jec t development objectives. One-hundred percent Bank f inanc ing cou ld be 
prov ided fo r some projects and activities w i t h strong evidence o f ownership and comm i tmen t . Recurrent 
cost f inanc ing w i l l be considered subject to strong demonstration o f arrangements t o ensure sustainability 
after Bank f inanc ing ceases. Taxes and duties w i l l also be f inanced p rov ided they are no t excessive. The 
Bank may f inance up to 100 percent o f the costs o f ind iv idua l projects; however, in the planned 
investment projects (Loca l Infrastructure Development Project, In fras truc ture Project, and D ive rs i f ica t ion 
operation) and the GEF grant, the Bank ’s f inanc ing share i s l i k e l y to be about 90 percent o f pro jec t costs. 
In tegra t ion o f Bank f inanc ing i n the budget process (e.g, the Na tu ra l Resources Management DPLs) w i l l 
ensure that increased recurrent cost f inanc ing wou ld no t jeopard ize ove ra l l debt and f isca l sustainability. 
B. Partnersh ip and Pa r t ic ipa t ion 

( i ) Partner Roles and Donor Coordination 

69 . 

Since the Bank began strengthening its presence in Gabon, there has been much mo re 
active coordination w i th the other key development pa r tne rs o n the ground. B i la te ra l and 
mu l t i la te ra l donors meet regu lar ly , and recen t ly thematic groups have been created to imp rove the 
harmonization o f donor support. In t h i s context, the present C A S was prepared in close co l labora t ion 
w i t h the donor community. P r inc ipa l development partners inc lude the European U n i o n (EU), the 
A f r ican Development Bank, France, various UN agencies and Canada, w i t h add i t iona l con tr ibu t ions 
expected during the CAS pe r iod f r om the US., Spain, and I ta ly . M u c h o f the b i la te ra l support comes i n 
the f o rm o f technical assistance. The Bank and UNDP are ac t ive ly i n v o l v e d in the GPRSP process, and 
a l l development partners are prepared to articulate the ir assistance strategies around the GPRSP p rog ram 
once i t i s completed and approved.

A l l operations and activities p lanned in this C A S w i l l be ca r r ied out as a complement to, o r 
in partnersh ip w i th other development pa r tne rs (see Annex 5). As governance i s a key issue in 
Gabon, the f i rs t pillar o f this CAS complements the in terven t ions o f France, UNDP, the EU, AfDB, IMF, 
UN ICEF , and Canada on capac i ty-bu i ld ing f o r macroeconomic reforms, pub l ic resources management, 
statistical capacity-building, and p romo t ion o f the ro le o f the c i v i l society. The planned Pub l ic

coord ina t ion be tween the EU, t h e Bank and AFDP ropa rco on pr iva te sector development and economic 
d ivers i f ica t ion . T h e Bank has been wo rk ing w i t h AFD, EU, AfDB, and the U S on the preparation o f the 
na t iona l fores try and environment program (PSFE), and these partners are also p lann ing to support the 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the program. O n the mining sector, the Bank i s wo rk ing closely w i t h the EU and 
France to im p r o v e the lega l framework and attract investors in the context o f economic d ivers i f ica t ion , 
put in p lace a regu la tory and ins t i tu t iona l framework, and imp rove mining adm in is tra t ion capacity. The 
same can be said o f infrastructure, where EU, AFD, AfDB and the Bank have collaborated to support the 
Government on the creation o f a second generation Road maintenance Fund. A l l o f these development 
partners have c lea r ly expressed to the Government the need to secure the f inanc ing o f road maintenance 
be fore cons ider ing any new projects in this sector. The Bank coordinates i t s ac t iv i t ies w i t h the IMF and 
has close co l labora t ion w i t h the Fund on development and imp lemen ta t ion o f the structural r e f o rm 
programs. F ina l ly , the W o r l d Bank Group works closely w i t h the UN agencies on the fight against 
HIV/AIDS.

Consultations during the CAS process revealed widespread misunderstanding, 
misinformation, and lack of information about the Bank’s ro le in Gabon’s development. 
Consultations with c i v i l society and other key stakeholders (Parliamentarians, academics, and the p r iva te 
sector) began du r ing the preparation o f the CASCR in M a r c h 2004. These consultations showed that 
expectations ra ised during the 1994-1997 Pover ty Assessment and concretized i n the 1998 CAS in terms 
o f expanded Bank operational support and presence in-coun try had no t been met. M o r e extensive 
consultations were he ld between October and December 2004 on the fo r thcom ing CAS . Fourteen 
meetings were held, invo lv ing some 400 people, inc lud ing one mee t ing w i t h Parliamentarians l e d by the 
Coun try D irec tor . M o s t o f the meetings were he ld in L ib rev i l le , but meetings were also he ld in Po r t

The outcomes of the CASCR and CAS consultations and the Client Survey are similar, even 
though different clients were consulted during each exercise. M a n y clients and c i v i l society members 
s t i l l w ish the Bank to support the Government in p rov id ing we l fare services, w i t h l i t t l e understanding o f 
the sustainability and external debt imp l ica t ions . Improvements in the management o f pub l ic resources 
and i n the c l ima te fo r p r iva te investment are prerequisites fo r success in other areas, and the Bank has a 
comparative advantage in wo rk ing w i t h Gabon in these areas. These views were shared b y k e y decision 
makers in Government who do understand the prob lems and the ro le that W o r l d Bank Group support 
( inc lud ing IBRD borrow ing) should p lay . In some instances other development partners are better p laced 
to assist Gabon in imp rov ing service delivery, o f ten w i t h grant resources. The c l ien t survey and 
consultations 
i l lus tra te the need to better communicate the Bank ’s strategy, demonstrating h o w 
improvements in the management o f bo th f isca l resources and na tura l resources w i l l con tr ibu te to 
achieving the coun try ’s development goals in a sustainable manner.

This represents an entry point for HIV/AIDS, to a s s i s t the Government to implement funds from other sources (e.g., the 
Global Fund), and manage their National HN /A IDS strategy. I t i s unclear i f the Government would consider using IBRD to 
finance an operation, but this option w i l l be kept under review. 
NGOParliamentary Capacity Building w i l l be supported through an increased number o f consultations with c iv i l 
society; a targeted e f for t to increase learning opportunities, through WB I for example, and possibly an IDF grant. 
The mining sector work w i l l review the mining law, including specifically the environmental and regulatory 
requirements in the mining sector. 
The planned Diversification operation could build on the FIAS and IFR recommendations act as an umbrella for natural

T h e main c r i te r ia fo r selecting B a n k interventions unde r the C A S have been whether o r not 
the p lanned act iv ity supports the two pillars, and whether o r not the Bank i s best placed to p rov ide 
the needed assistance. The CAS includes, in add i t ion to substantial non- lend ing support, three targeted 
lend ing operations that support b o t h strategic p i l lars . The US$25 m i l l i o n L o c a l In fras truc ture 
Development Pro jec t expected fo r Boa rd presentation in June 2005, i s designed to develop small-scale 
infrastructure in response to commun i ty needs and to instill transparent f inanc ing and pub l ic wo rks 
contracting practices. Through the planned Na tura l Resources Management D P L in F Y 0 6 (US$15 
m i l l ion ) , the B a n k w i l l support the establishment o f transparent na tura l resource governance and l a w 
enforcement practices in the forest sectors, cap i ta l iz ing on the recent wave o f re forms and open ing the 
door fo r s im i lar re forms in the fisheries and m in ing sector. This operation w i l l also help imp rove the 
environment f o r investment b y leve l ing the p lay ing field and p rov id ing clear rules o f access to inves tmen t 
opportunities (e.g. auc t ion ing o f forest permits). The US$10 m i l l i o n GEF grant w i l l support the 
sustainable management and development o f Gabon’s na t iona l parks. The US$25 m i l l i o n In fras truc ture 
Project planned f o r F Y 0 8 w i l l be designed to imp rove the management o f basic in fras truc ture t o mee t 
transport needs in the coun try and w i l l be complementary to other partners’ programs. In the H i g h Case, 
a FY09 US$18 m i l l i o n D ive rs i f ica t ion support operation w i l l build on the recommendations o f p lanned 
advisory w o r k p rov ided through FIAS, IFR, and EITI, and w i l l develop the capacity o f Gabon’s p r iva te 
sector to con tr ibu te to economic growth. A F Y 0 8 Na tu ra l Resources Management DPL w i l l build on the 
progress i n the forest sector, and pursue imp roved practices in the fisheries, and m i n i n g sector. 

Pillar 1: 

Strengthening the management of public resources (both natural and financial) f o r 
improved social outcomes 

Improving efficiency and equity in public expenditures 

7 5 . 

T h e main instrument to achieve this outcome w i l l be a combined Pub l ic Expend i tu re 
Rev iewKoun t ry F inanc ia l Accountability AssessmentlCountry Procurement and Aud i t Rev iew , 
p lanned fo r completion in FY06. The aim o f t h i s ac t iv i ty i s to imp rove pub l ic expenditure management 
and con t ro l systems, ensuring that allocated funds are used fo r the purposes they were intended and that 
they achieve the expected results. I t i s also expected that the exercise wou ld incorporate a focus on 
pover ty analysis, based on the results o f the CW I Q survey and the GPRSP. The process i s p lanned to 
reinforce early imp lemen ta t ion o f the GPRSP by a l ign ing budget p lann ing to the GPRSP objectives. This 
exercise w i l l be re in forced by statistical capacity development ac t iv i t ies to imp rove governance and 
accountability and measure progress in ach iev ing results. 

76. 

The imp lementat ion o f the recommendations o f the combined P E W C F A A K P A R repo r t 
w i l l be followed up th rough continuing dialogue between Government , other pa r t ic ipa t ing donors, 
the Bank and the IMF. A PER l im i t e d to expenditures in in fras truc ture across sectors, was carr ied out 
in 2000/2001 under the U r b a n LIL. Among the findings, three are o f par t icu lar interest in the context o f 
the current exercise: (i) more than 50 percent o f the pub l ic inves tmen t p rog ram (PIP) i s allocated t o 
infrastructure, but the execution rate i s very l o w (less than 20 percent o f in fras truc ture projects were 
actually carr ied out among those iden t i f ied in the PIP); (ii) g iven the s ign i f icance o f infrastructure in the 
PIP, the PER made some specific recommendations on h o w to ca r ry out fo r thcom ing PERs w i t h a 
par t icu lar focus on infrastructure; and (iii) due to the l o w execu t ion ra t io , much attention i s needed in the 
management o f pub l ic expenditures and pub l ic works contracts, wh ich i s one o f the objectives o f the new 
Loca l Infrastructure Deve lopmen t Pro jec t . The last recommenda t ion i s pa r t icu la r ly impor tan t fo r 
ensuring the sustainability o f SMEs, as contracts have suffered f r om poo r management in the past (e.g., 
delays in payments o f greater than 250 days).

7 7 . 

U n d e r the Loca l In f ras t ruc tu re Development Pro ject (US$25 m i l l ion) expected to be 
presented to the Boa rd in June 2005, the capacity o f loca l Governments and community groups w i l l 
be strengthened to address local needs w i th the ir own resources. This wou ld he lp re l ieve an 
unsustainable bu rden on central Government. The pro jec t has been prepared b y PAPSUT , a semi- 
autonomous techn ica l unit under the M in is t ry o f P lann ing and Economy. PAPSUT was prev ious ly 
responsible fo r the successful imp lemen ta t ion o f the Transport Sector Techn ica l Assistance Pro jec t 
(approved in FY95 and closed in FYOO), under wh ich strategies were prepared fo r transport and urban 
sectors, and f o r the U rban LIL wh ich tested key po l icy features o f the urban strategy. This techn ica l unit 
has n o w acqu ired considerable experience in p romo t ing community-based upgrad ing o f poor urban 
neighborhoods in Gabon. 

7 8 . 

Th rough consultation and t ra in ing programs, the Bank w i l l he lp strengthen the ro le o f 
Pa r l iamen t and c iv i l society to mon itor resource revenues and pub l ic expenditures. Capac i ty 
development exercises and continued in fo rma t ion sharing through consultation w i l l he lp c i v i l society 
acquire more e f fec t ive ways and means t o exercise the ir oversight ro le ( fo r example, by pa r t ic ipa t ing in 
the E IT I consu l ta t ive committee, 
the Forestry oversight body, forest zon ing processes and the 
management o f commun i ty forests, and the pub l ic disclosure o f relevant in forma t ion , as w e l l as the U rban 
Project’s commun i ty consultations). WB I support w i l l be mob i l ized to p rov ide training to 
Parliamentarians and c i v i l society leaders. An IDF grant w i l l also be sought fo r t h i s purpose. 
Improving revenue mobilization and ensuring sustainable management of natural resources 

7 9 . 

U n d e r the EITI, the B a n k w i l l support government efforts to increase the share o f o i l 
revenues transferred to the Treasury (see Box 4). The intermediate output o f EITI w i l l be the 
pub l ica t ion o f a repor t comparing a l l relevant extractive indus try revenues received b y Government w i t h 
amounts p a i d b y E1 companies, in a read i ly accessible and easily understandable format. An independent 
audit w i l l ensure the in teg r i ty o f the exercise, and appropriate legal, ins t i tu t iona l , and f inanc ia l 
arrangements w i l l be put in place to ensure the sustainability o f the process. The Bank w i l l continue t o 
prov ide advice and assistance to the Government in the various steps o f the imp lemen ta t ion process by 
p rov id ing in fo rma t ion on the EITI, adv is ing on the design o f the associated in fo rma t ion campaign, 
fac i l i ta t ing the dialogue w i t h other stakeholders ( c i v i l society, companies), sharing other countries’ 
imp lemen ta t ion experience, and p rov id ing comments on the repo r t ing template and procedure. 

80 . 

T h e expected benef it o f E IT I w i l l include an imp roved business environment, hence greater 
attractiveness o f Gabon as an investment destination in the o i l and gas and mining sector. I n addition, the 
par t ic ipa tory approach invo lved in the In i t ia t ive w i l l he lp in i t ia te a broad-based debate on better use o f the 
country’s na tura l resources. The tra in ing associated w i t h the imp lemen ta t ion o f the In i t ia t ive w i l l he lp 
imp rove the ab i l i ty o f the Execu t ive to devise sector po l ic ies and o f Parliament to oversee the 
imp lemen ta t ion o f these po l ic ies . 

8 1. 

T h e two N a t u r a l Resources Managemen t Deve lopment Policy Loans (FY06, US$15 m i l l ion 
and FY08, US$10 m i l l ion) p lanned fo r the CAS period, w i l l he lp to cement the imp lementat ion o f 
reforms fo r mo re efficient, transparent and sustainable exp lo itat ion of n a t u r a l resources, thereby 
also contr ibut ing to pub l ic revenue mob i l izat ion . The first operation w i l l build on the s ign i f ican t 
recent reforms already achieved in the forest sector (see paragraph 49), inc lud ing the imp lemen ta t ion o f 
the re fo rm agenda set fo r th in the 2004 Forestry Le t te r o f Sector Po l icy wh ich requires overcom ing long - 
t ime vested interests. The operation w i l l he lp con t inue t o imp rove tax co l lec t ion f r om the fores try sector, 
and w i l l also lay the groundwork fo r fu ture revenue g row th f r om fishing and mining. Related k e y areas 
fo r improvemen t in managing na tura l resources w h i c h the operation w i l l assist in imp lemen t ing are: (a) 
imp rov ing p r ic ing mechanisms and transparency in a l loca t ing and manag ing exp lo i ta t ion rights, licenses 
and concessions; (b) securing co l lec t ion o f f isca l revenues; (c) managing the resource base sustainably; 

-29- 

and (d) mon i to r ing and en forc ing contracts and laws, and app ly ing penalties to reduce t h e appeal o f non- 
comp l iance and secure a leve l-p lay ing f ie ld . The choice o f development po l icy loan as the instrument o f 
Bank assistance i s based on the des irab i l i ty o f l i n k i n g f inanc ia l support to imp lemen ta t ion o f reforms. 
The p lanned program w i l l strengthen the voice o f reformers and increase the ir capacity to overcome 
resistance f r om vested interests. The choice o f tw o DPLs fo r natural resources management, w i t h the 
second be ing in the H i g h Case, w i l l also he lp m i t iga te the risk o f wan ing re fo rm momentum. 

82. 

The Na tu ra l Resources Management DPLs are also a f i r s t s t e p in support o f the 
Government’s efforts to build a sustainable and responsible f i s h e r i e s sector and to complement 
activities o f other development partners in t h e sector, such as AfDB, EU and Japan. The operations 

w o u l d focus on: upstream analysis to prepare a coherent strategy fo r the sector’s management and 
development; e f fec t ive imp lemen ta t ion o f fisheries governance; greater transparency in order to lay the 
g roundwo rk fo r sustainable management o f fish stocks; building awareness o f responsible fisheries; and 
building the human and ins t i tu t iona l capacity requ ired to e f fec t ive ly manage the sector. 

Completing and implementing the GPRSP 

83. 

The Bank w i l l continue to support t h e GPRSP process by pa r t ic ipa t ing in t h e f ina l stages o f 
preparation and t h e early stages o f implementation, in collaboration w i t h other development 

partners and c i v i l society. The focus o f Bank assistance w i l l continue to be expanding pub l ic 
par t ic ipa t ion in t h e process, imp rov ing the pover ty database, supporting the development o f statistical 
capacity, and deve lop ing mechanisms fo r fu ture mon i to r ing and evaluation, inc lud ing strengthening their 
results-based orientation. These ac t iv i t ies w i l l be expanded and strengthened over t ime as the momen tum 
o f GPRSP imp lemen ta t ion p icks up. 

84. 

As p a r t of t h i s program, a new Poverty Assessment would b e undertaken fo r completion in 

FY09. This assessment w i l l p rov ide the basis f o r a more re l iab le analysis than was possible under the 
first Pover ty Assessment. Together w i t h the programs and sectoral strategies t o be developed under the 
GPRSP, i t w i l l p rov ide a stronger founda t ion fo r d i rec t ing resources to pove r ty a l lev ia t ion under the 
successor to t h i s CAS . 

Addressing the challenge of HZV/AZDS 

85 . 

The Bank w i l l seek to mobilize an IDF g ran t in FY06 to support ins t i tu t iona l capacity 
development f o r the implementation o f the National Strategy to F igh t H IV /A IDS . The grant wou ld 

be used to he lp strengthen government capacity to dep loy resources secured f r om the G loba l Fund f o r

I n a high-case lending scenario (see pa rag raph 102), p repa ra t ion o f an operation to support 
diversification and associated capacity development would be undertaken du r ing the CAS per iod . 
As ide f r om p o l i c y and ins t i tu t iona l reforms, possible components o f such an operation wou ld inc lude 
capacity development in i t ia t ives fo r the pr iva te sector in selected g row th sectors, inc lud ing o i l , mining 
and t imber-re la ted industries, and tour ism where pub l ic and pr iva te partners w i l l agree on specific 
measures t o accelerate growth. 
In this context, the Government has expressed interest in rep l ica t ing 
Bank-assisted experiences in supporting export d ivers i f ica t ion in other countries, such as Tunisia. 

88. 

T h e d ivers if icat ion agenda w i l l need to be accompanied b y regu latory changes as we l l as 
technical s k i l l s upg rad ing in cr it ica l industry sectors. An overhaul o f Gabonese technical t ra in ing 
institutes and mechanisms to re- too l labor are needed as part o f the investment c l ima te re form . The 
MIGA guarantee supporting the vocational tra in ing pro jec t w i l l support t h i s need. 
In terna t iona l 
experience shows that the co l labora t ion o f the pr iva te sector in the imp lemen ta t ion o f na t iona l 
competitiveness enhancing measures i s essential. T o fac i l i ta te t h i s collaboration, a pr iva te-pub l ic 
dialogue p la t fo rm wou ld need t o be established. Government's capacity in economic p lann ing and p o l i c y 
mak ing needs to b e strengthened, as w e l l as the in fo rma t ion base fo r such po l ic ies . Capacity development 
and streamlining o f pub l ic sector functions i n economic po l icy -mak ing are equa l ly impor tan t . Unde r the 
planned D ive rs i f ica t ion operation, appropriate resources w i l l also be earmarked fo r ac t iv i t ies a imed at

I t i s impo r tan t for Gabon to continue to exercise its leadership and to honor i t s 
commitments to the sub-region. Gabon’s r i c h reserves and p r ime coastal loca t ion g ive i t a fundamental 
ro le i n con t inu ing to imp rove the depth o f reg iona l in tegra t ion in the C E M A C region. First, Gabon w i l l 
need to he lp ensure that the C EM A C macroeconomic convergence cr i ter ia continue to be adhered to and 
that the system o f mu l t i la te ra l surveillance functions e f fec t ive ly . Second, Gabon, together w i t h 
Cameroon, w i l l have to ensure that large transit taxes and administrative barriers to trade are 
progressively dismantled, and that transport log is t ics are strengthened (or facilitated), in order to imp rove 
the e f f ic iency o f the sub reg iona l transit corridors and to pro tec t the interests o f the land locked countries. 
Third, Gabon w i l l need to honor i t s commitments t o the reg iona l compensation fund, wh ich was set up to 
compensate the poorer, land- locked countries (e.g., the Cen tra l A f r ican Repub l ic and Chad) fo r the loss o f 
t a r i f f revenues when they jo ined the C E M A C un ion . F ina l ly , Gabon can act as a fac i l i ta to r fo r sub-

V I . MANAGING RISK 

107. A key externa l risk affecting the ab i l ity o f this CAS to achieve the desired results wou ld be a 
sharp d rop in pe t ro leum prices. This wou ld undermine government revenues and put the coun try at 
risk o f be ing unab le to meet i t s commitments to the IMF and the Paris Club. Conversely, the persistence 
o f high o i l pr ices (above US$40 per barrel) cou ld reduce the incen t ive fo r transparency and tr igger a s h i f t 
to the low-case scenario. The current ou t look i s fo r wo r ld pe tro leum prices to rema in stable (at the 
average o f last year’s levels), though there may be short-term fluctuations due to temporary imbalances 
between supply and demand. A related risk has to do w i t h the ab i l i ty o f Gabon t o ma in ta in i t s curren t 
produc t ion levels. Produc t ion i s projected to decline and these projections have been taken in to account 
in establishing the med ium- term framework . The risk o f a sharper decline i s re la t ive ly small, whereas the 
upside risk o f d iscover ing new reserves or new ways o f increasing pe tro leum produc t ion f r om curren t 
f ie lds i s more significant. 

108. The re i s a risk tha t Gabon’s debt bu rden would aga in become unsustainable. The debt 
burden o f Gabon i s substantial, but the coun try has recen t ly imp roved i t s ove ra l l debt management 
strategy, pa r t icu la r ly through Paris C lub rescheduling, and the planned IBRD lend ing w i l l no t ma te r ia l ly 
affect the coun try ’s debt position. The assumptions unde r ly ing the med ium- term ou t look however, are 
extremely sensitive to the development o f o i l produc t ion and prices and to non -o i l output growth. I f o i l 
revenue w ind fa l ls are app l ied to debt reduction, this w i l l he lp m i t iga te the risk that the debt burden wou ld 
again become unsustainable. Con t inued donor coordination, as w e l l as IMF oversight, should he lp to 
ensure that the Government does no t embark on f inanc ing o f over ly large investment projects or again 
become invo lved i n unsustainable borrow ing . 

109. A key in te rna l risk i s a departure f r om the recently-recovered sound fiscal management 
practices, wh ich may occur in the context o f the upcom ing Presidential e lec t ion or fo r other reasons. 
This cou ld also disrupt relations w i t h the IMF and limit the ab i l i ty o f the Treasury to meet budget 
requirements, w i t h a consequent reduc t ion in pub l ic expenditures fo r pove r ty a l lev ia t ion or other 
development purposes. To m i t iga te this risk, the Bank and the IMF w i l l seek t o ma in ta in a constant 
dialogue w i t h Government to ensure that pub l ic expenditures rema in on track. Fa i lu re in t h i s area wou ld 
mean that Gabon wou ld move to a L o w Case and wou ld receive less support f r om the Bank. A t the 
pro jec t level, training fo r pro jec t s ta f f and e f fec t ive supervision should ma in ta in po r t fo l io performance i n 
satisfactory status. The PER-related exercise i n FY06 should also he lp reduce the risk o f delays in 
counterpart funding. 

110. A re la ted risk i s tha t the comm itment o f Government to structura l reforms w i l l fa l te r 
and/or that vested interests w i l l succeed in prevent ing such re fo rms f r o m be ing implemented. 
Currently, in part ow ing to the increasing urgency o f o i l reserve dep le t ion and o f d ive rs i fy ing the 
country’s sources o f income, a c r i t ica l mass o f government comm i tmen t to r e f o rm imp lemen ta t ion i s 
apparent, w i t h leadership f r om the senior-most authorities. Success in p r iva t iz ing pub l ic enterprises, 
b r ing ing the debt p rob lem under control, gradua l ly imp rov ing the transparency o f forest resource 
management, and restoring the Road Fund has strengthened the hand o f the reformers in Government. 
And unless t h e upcom ing Pres iden t ia l e lec t ion br ings about ma jo r change in the po l icy d irec t ion espoused 
by the current administration, an even tua l i ty v iewed b y mos t po l i t ica l observers as un l ike ly , government 
comm i tmen t to the ongo ing r e f o rm process i s l i k e l y t o be strengthened rather than weakened over the 
nex t f ive years. Technocrats, pa r t icu la r ly younger ones, are increas ing ly aware that re forms are necessary 
to avo id a progressive unde rm in ing o f the system and t o preserve soc ia l peace, wh ich i s v iewed as 
increasingly frag i le in many circles. A stronger ro le f o r Parliament, the p r iva te sector, and c i v i l society 
w i l l also help to h o l d the Government mo re accountable. This ro le w i l l be underpinned b y Bank and 
other donor activities to support imp roved governance and capacity development. 

-36- 

11 1. T h e r e i s nevertheless some risk tha t the upcoming Presidential election wou ld resu lt in a 
m a j o r change o f Government, br ing ing a new set o f stakeholders to the table and slowing the pace 
o f re fo rm . W h i l e this risk i s considered to be small, in the event that i t does occur, the Bank wou ld 
undertake extensive consultations w i t h members o f the new Government to determine i t s comm i tmen t t o 
the strategy ou t l ined in the present CAS and the appropriate course o f action fo r the Bank to pursue. 

V I I I . CONCLUDING REMARKS 

112. Gabon i s fac ing a great challenge. Replacing dec l in ing pe tro leum produc t ion w i t h other sources 
o f income w i l l prove d i f f icu l t : Gabon w i l l have to drama t ica l ly increase the e f f ic iency w i t h wh ich i t uses 
i t s ex is t ing pub l ic resources; i t w i l l also need to imp rove the business c l ima te to foster p r iva te investment 
in the non -o i l sectors. The W o r l d Bank Group has been asked to he lp Gabon imp lemen t the right po l ic ies 
to ensure that the current w indow o f oppor tun i ty - clear signs o f comm i tmen t on the par t o f the coun try ’s 
top leadership to sound macroeconomic management and to imp lemen t d i f f icu l t , far-reaching re forms - i s 
no t lost. In partnership w i t h other development partners, the Gabonese c i v i l society and pr iva te sector, 
the W o r l d Bank Group i s we l l-p laced to he lp Gabon succeed in d ive rs i fy ing i t s economy and imp rov ing

ANNEX 2. Capacity Building for Parliamentarians 

Challenges: 

The Gabonese Parliament faces challenges in terms o f i t s capacity to vo ice i t s 
constituents’ needs and i t s con tr ibu t ion to designing and overseeing government-led in i t ia t ives . 
The first challenge i s po l i t ica l : in bo th chambers, the r u l i n g par ty (Pa r t i Democratique Gabonais 
(PDG) ho lds an overwhe lm ing ma jo r i ty o f seats. The rema in ing seats are he ld by weak oppos i t ion 
parties o r parties that have a l l ied w i t h the PDG. Substantial amendments to government-submitted 
laws are rare, i t s po l ic ies are ha rd ly ever questioned and very few leg is la t ive propos i t ions are 
in troduced by the Parliament. The c red ib i l i ty o f b o t h chambers i s therefore weakened, pa r t icu la r ly 
that o f the Senate wh ich was created in 1996 and i s perceived as a venue fo r re t ired friends o f the 
ruling regime. The i r capacity to represent the ir constituent’s needs and concerns i s questioned. 
The lack o f in fo rma t ion available to the Parliamentarians constitutes a second challenge. They are 
poo r ly in fo rmed on key issues (such as NEPAD, the GPRSP process, and the H I P C in i t ia t ive , 
inc lud ing e l i g i b i l i t y criteria) and on Government policies. Parliamentarians do n o t have easy access 
to negotiated agreements between the Government and third parties and are no t aware o f the 
in terna t iona l ins t i tu t ions ’ procedures and fo l low -up mechanisms. This situation undermines the 
Parliament’s ab i l i ty to question the executive and i t also weakens i t s ro le o f commun ica t ing and 
exp la in ing po l ic ies and issues to member constituencies. 
The lack o f ins t i tu t iona l tra in ing o f the members o f Parliament represents a third challenge. Some 
members do no t have a l o t o f experience in parliamentary procedure or in dea l ing w i t h p o l i c y issues 
and are no t f u l l y aware o f the ir functions and respons ib i l i ty . Some members o f the F inance 
Comm i t tee lack the necessary tra in ing t o analyze the budget. 

Bank Response 

1. 

2. 

The Bank plans to assist the Parliamentarians by enhancing the ir capacity to shape pub l ic po l icy and 
represent the popu la t ion through programs supported b y WB I and/or the Coun try O f f ice . These 
programs w i l l consist o f 
Organize roundtables w i t h b o t h Chambers o f Parliament to present the Bank, i t s procedures, 
and i t s re la t ionsh ip w i t h Government and c i v i l society. The members o f Par l iamen t asked fo r a 
sustained dialogue w i t h the Bank during the C A S consultations. Quar ter ly meetings were 
suggested. 
Finance tra in ing programs fo r Parliamentarians (on h ow to read a budget, on good governance, 
on con t ro l mechanisms, on issues re la t ing t o responsibilities, etc.). Previous f i e l d v i s i t s to other 
countries have been much appreciated b y the Parliamentarians who find them use fu l in terms o f 
ne twork ing , know ledge-bu i ld ing and in fo rma t ion gathering. 
Encourage the Government to thorough ly invo lve Members o f Par l iamen t in the fo rmu la t ion 
and imp lemen ta t ion o f the GPRSP. 
A s s i s t Parliamentarians to better represent the interests o f citizens in the p o l i c y process, 
pa r t icu la r ly in the context o f the GPRSP. 
Promote dialogue and in terac t ion between C i v i l Society Organizations and members o f 
Parliament. 
Assist in strengthening the in te rna l organization o f Parliament ( fo r example, strengthening 
committee system, inves t ing in In fo rma t ion and Commun ica t ion Technology ( ICT ) so as t o 
imp rove t h e research capacity o f Parliamentarians). 
Enhance pub l ic awareness o f the ro le o f Parliamentarians. 
Support and coordinate actions towards Par l iamen tary capac i ty-bu i ld ing undertaken b y other 
donors (UNDP fo r example).

ANNEX 3. CAS Consultations 

The consultations f o r the CAS 2005-2008 were carr ied out between October 27, and December 
20, 2004. Four teen meetings were he ld in wh ich more than 410 people participated. The reasons beh ind 
this very extensive consultation process were two - fo ld : f i r s t , the W o r l d Bank wanted to obtain a w ide 
range o f v iews and opinions f rom a l l sectors o f society on the development needs and issues faced b y the 
coun try and on suggestions on how the Bank cou ld assist in addressing those needs. Second, the Bank 
sought to respond to the necessity made apparent in the evaluation o f the previous CAS (1998-2004) o f 
mak ing i tse l f mo re k n ow n on the ground and extending i t s outreach. 

The groups consulted inc luded members o f the Government, the Senate, the Na t iona l Assembly 
and the Judiciary. The Bank also organized a s ign i f ican t number o f meetings w i t h c i v i l society (non- 
governmental organizations, associations, unions, academia, pr iva te sector and the media). I t was decided 
to h o l d separate meetings w i t h na t iona l business associations and fore ign employers, a l though bo th 
representing the p r iva te sector, as their concerns d i f fe r extensively. The Soc ia l and Econom ic Council, a 
constitutionally-entrenched advisory counc i l composed o f h igh - leve l representatives f r om every sector o f 
society also took pa r t i n one meeting. 

In addition, the Bank sought the op in ion o f Gabonese res id ing outside the capital. T w o 
consultations took place in c i t ies in the in te r io r o f the country, i n b o t h cases w i t h a cross-section o f 
stakeholders. The f i r s t one was he ld in Port-Gentil, Gabon’s second mos t impor tan t c i t y and the country’s 
pe tro leum and f inanc ia l capital. The other was he ld in Franceville, Gabon’s third main c i t y and the center 
o f the country’s m ine ra l industry. Besides representing Gabon’s economic poles, these tw o c i t ies were 
per t inen t fo r the consu l ta t ion process as they are bo th beneficiaries o f Bank- f inanced projects. 

The consultations, conducted by the Coun try Representative, were fac i l i ta ted by a highly- 
respected member of c i v i l society. The Coun try D irec tor , on a m iss ion f r o m Washington, was present f o r 
the mee t ing w i t h the Na t iona l Assembly. The feedback f r om the consultations has been shared w i t h the 
government whose representatives participated in some o f the events. 

Each o f the consultations fo l lowed the same process. E i the r the Coun try Representative o r the 
Resident Econom is t made a short presentation exp la in ing the strategic pillars o f the d ra f t CAS 2005- 
2008, i t s measurements and the r i s k s that cou ld impede i t s implementation. A b r i e f presentation o f the 
work ings o f the W o r l d Bank and a repor t of the conclusions o f the las t C A S (1998-2004) were also 
inc luded in the presentation. A discussion fo l lowed , a imed at ob ta in ing feedback on (1) the pertinence o f 
the proposed Bank in terven t ions to assist the Government’s ongo ing e f for ts to d ive rs i fy the economy, 
generate employment in the pr iva te sector and address poverty; (2) the appropriateness o f the proposed

means to increase transparency, good governance and better p lann ing f o r soc ia l services de l ivery . 

T o summarize b r i e f l y the ma in conclusions o f the consultations, the d irec t ion and p i l la rs o f the 
dra f t CAS were broad ly endorsed. However , the participants emphasized the need to imp rove the 
education system, inves t in roads, develop the agriculture sector and curve the spread o f H I V / A I D S . In 
addition, the people consulted repeatedly asked the Bank to establish a d irec t partnership w i t h c i v i l 
society, w i thou t the invo lvemen t of the Government o f wh ich they distrust the capacity and w i l l to 
imp lemen t development-related projects and reforms. Because the W o r l d Bank ’s presence in the coun try 
has no t been sustained over the last decade, the participants also took the oppor tun i ty to vo ice the ir 
questions and concerns regarding the W o r l d Bank, i t s procedures and i t s re la t ionsh ip w i t h the 
Government. I t was thus an occasion for the Gabonese t o air grievances and fo r the W o r l d Bank to 
exp la in misunderstandings. I t was agreed that the Bank needed to extend the dialogue and the outreach 
and i n f o rm the pub l ic o f i t s ac t iv i t ies i n Gabon.

Overa l l , the stakeholders consulted appreciated the fact that they cou ld express the ir concerns and 
g ive suggestions d irec t ly to representatives o f the W o r l d Bank. This enthusiastic response to the 
consultations made i t clear that a more systematic and sustained par t ic ipa tory process was in demand 
w i t h i n c i v i l society and was necessary to achieve the proposed goals.

Background 

Gabon i s a coun try o f some 268,000 km2 w i t h a popu la t ion curren t ly estimated at 1.3 m i l l ion . An 
estimated 75% o f the popu la t ion i s concentrated in tw o cities (L ib rev i l le , pop. 450,000, and Po r t Gen t i l , 
pop. 100,000) and some 50 smaller towns. The country i s r i c h in na tura l resources, inc lud ing petroleum, 
manganese and other minerals, and t rop ica l forests. The ru ra l areas are v i r tua l ly empty (popu la t ion 
density <2 persons/km2) as many residents have m igra ted to urban centers in order to access pub l ic 
services and to participate in an economy based large ly on the red is tr ibu t ion o f rents f r om resource 
extraction. The country has also received a s ign i f ican t stream o f migrants f r o m other countries along the 
coast, who are active in the forma l and in fo rma l sectors o f the economy. There i s a s ign i f ican t presence 
o f fo re ign investors, ma in ly French, who have developed the nation’s na tura l resources in partnership 
w i t h the Government. 

Loca ted on the west coast o f former French Equa tor ia l A f r ica , Gabon has p layed a strategic ro le 
in ma in ta in ing peace and stability in that reg ion since i t s independence in 1960. Gabon has experienced 
extraordinary con t inu i ty in i t s domestic po l i t ica l regime. I t s Independence hero and first president, Leon 
M ’ba , d ied in o f f ice in 1967. The presidency was then assumed by A lbe r t -Be rna rd Bongo (now known as 
E l H a d j Omar Bongo Ondimba), the leader o f the nation’s single po l i t ica l party. 
In 1990 a new 
cons t i tu t ion was approved, establishing a mu l t ipa r ty system o f democracy. President Bongo was re- 
elected in 1993 and again in 1998. In add i t ion to ma in ta in ing re la t ive social peace in terna l ly , the reg ime 
maintains close links to France and has p layed an impor tan t part i n med ia t ing con f l ic ts in ne ighbor ing 
countries. Gabon aspires to become a leader in the emerging Cen tra l A f r i c a n economic commun i ty . 

Gabon i s a r i c h coun try by A f r i c a n standards. W i t h a GN P equivalent to about U S $4 b i l l ion , 
Gabon’s per capita income i s over $3,000, mak ing i t ine l ig ib le f o r IDA bo r row ing . Revenues are der ived 
large ly f r om pe tro leum exports, w i t h add i t iona l con tr ibu t ions f r om manganese mining, wood and wood 
products. Ag r icu l tu re adds less than 10% to GDP, w i t h the balance about even ly d iv ided between 
indus try and services. During the o i l b o om o f 1973 to 1985, the government adopted a paternalistic 
approach to poverty reduc t ion b y p romo t ing full employment, p rov id ing generous wages in the pub l ic and 
parastatal sectors, and establishing an elaborate social security system. This approach b rough t benefits to 
the urban elite, wh ich were fur ther shared through f am i l y networks, and he lped t o tr igger a massive ru ra l 
exodus. 

-51- 

This approach was successful in reducing the incidence o f extreme pover ty in the country, but did 
l i t t l e to reduce re la t ive poverty. Furthermore, i t encouraged the g row th o f a dua l economy, in wh ich r u r a l 
areas were ma rg ina l ized and the output o f tradable goods, par t icu lar ly agriculture, decreased (the “Du tch 
syndrome”). The government invested heav i ly in cap i ta l projects and industries, assuming substantial 
debt in the process. Despite high education and health expenditures, the regressive design and ine f f ic ien t 
management o f these services made l i t t l e impac t on social indicators, mak ing them comparable to those 
for poorer ID A - e l i g i b l e A f r ican countries. 

The W o r l d Bank was invo lved w i t h Gabon in the early years o f independence through pro jec ts in 
roads, education, u rban water supply, and manganese mining. During t h e o i l boom, however, Gabon did 
no t see a need fo r IBRD borrow ing . A f te r the o i l crisis in 1986, the Bank again supported Gabon through 
a S truc tura l Ad jus tmen t Loan, a Techn ica l Assistance Pro jec t aimed at imp rov ing macroeconomic 
management, and a Road Maintenance Project. However, due to deteriorating terms o f trade f o r i t s 
p r inc ipa l exports and overvaluation o f the C F A franc, Gabon’s economic performance con t inued to 
weaken. The devaluation of 1993, accompanied b y an Econom ic Recovery L o a n and an IMF Stand-by 
arrangement, enabled Gabon to restore macro-economic s tab i l i ty . Gabon took the lead among Cen tra l 
A f r ican countries in rev is ing trade and investment incentives, reduc ing or e l im ina t ing barriers to trade and 
special privileges. In 1995 Gabon embarked on a more ambitious re fo rm p rog ram supported by a three- 
year extended arrangement w i t h the IMF. Though t h i s program encountered in terna l and external 
d i f f icu l t ies in execution, i t demonstrated the comm i tmen t o f the authorities to imp roved macroeconomic 
management and restored growth. 

Gabon’s f i rs t C A S was prepared in 1994 and accompanied the Econom ic Recovery L o a n (ERL). 
A p r io r operation, the Forestry and Env ironmen t Pro jec t (FY 93), supported ins t i tu t iona l r e f o rm and 
capacity building in the forestry sector. The C A S also envisaged fo r FY 94 and FY 95 a qu ick-d isburs ing 
Pub l ic Sector Res truc tur ing Loan , a Transport and U rban In fras truc ture Techn ica l Assistance Project, and 
an Ag r icu l tu re Services Project. Fo r the outer years o f FY 96 and FY 97, i t anticipated lend ing support 
fo r human resource development, a po l icy-based operation in the transport sector, and investment 
operations in transport and urban development. The ERL closed on t ime w i t h satisfactory ratings. The 
TransportAJrban TA L o a n was approved as foreseen in FY 95, and was s t i l l under imp lemen ta t ion at the 
t ime o f the 1998 CAS. Progress on p r iva t iza t ion was slower than expected, and the P r iva t iza t ion and 
Regu la tory Capacity B u i l d i n g Pro jec t was on ly approved in FY 97. An U rban LIL, based on a successful 
p i l o t under the TransportAJrban TA Project, was approved in early FY 99. In addition, a Reg iona l 
Env ironmen ta l In fo rma t ion Management Pro jec t funded by GEF and based in Gabon was approved in FY 
97. In other sectors, the anticipated operations did no t ma ter ia l ize . 

In 1995, the W o r l d Bank carr ied out a Pover ty Assessment (PA) in Gabon. I t analyzed data f r om 
the 1993 General Popu la t ion Census and the 1994 Househo ld Expend i ture Survey (the la t ter l im i t e d to 
about 400 households in L i b r e v i l l e and Por t Gen t i l) , as w e l l as f r om par t ic ipa tory discussions w i t h poor 
people in L ib rev i l le and some towns o f the in ter ior . An urban absolute pove r ty l ine was established, 
based on the HES results, at about U S $700 per capita income o r approx ima te ly tw ice the r u r a l absolute 
pover ty l i n e o f a do l lar a day (U S $365 per capita). The re la t ive pove r ty l i n e was set at the lega l 
minimum wage, corresponding to a pe r capita income o f about U S $1,450. Using these definitions, the 
study showed that wh i le absolute pove r ty had dropped f r om 66% to 23% between 1960 and 1994, re la t ive 
pover ty had declined on ly slightly, f r om 87% in 1960 to 83% i n 1994. There were dramatic differences 
in standards o f l i v i n g between the e l i te m ino r i ty and the vast ma jo r i ty o f the population, inc lud ing many 
public employees who had to make the ir incomes stretch to meet the needs o f large extended families. 
There were also impor tan t rura l-urban and in te r -p rov inc ia l disparities in pove r ty and social indicators. 

The report proposed the broad outlines o f a pove r ty reduc t ion strategy f o r Gabon. The p r io r i ty 
goals proposed fo r such a strategy were: 
(a) reduc ing unemp loymen t , (b) raising incomes fo r sma l l 

-52- 

farmers, (c) im p r o v i n g basic public health, (d) rehab i l i ta t ing the urban environment, (e) re fo rm ing soc ia l 
pro tec t ion po l ic ies , and (f) establishing a re l iab le statistics system. The Bank study iden t i f ied several 
precond i t ions fo r the success o f such a program: disengaging the state f r om indus tr ia l and commerc ia l 
ac t iv i t ies and red irec t ing the resources saved to programs d irec t ly bene f i t ing the poor; creating an 
enab l ing env ironmen t for pr iva te sector development that wou ld promote the g row th o f labor- in tens ive 
rather than capital-intensive activities; and imp rov ing the transparency and e f f ic iency o f budge t 
management b y p romo t ing commun i ty invo lvemen t in service p rov is ion and fac i l i ta t ing the emergence o f 
NGOs . 

The Pover ty Assessment was carried out under the guidance o f an In te r M in is te r ia l Techn ica l 
Comm i t tee cha ired by the M in is t ry o f Planning, and in co l labora t ion w i t h other donors, no tab ly UNDP 
and France. The PA and proposed strategy were discussed and disseminated at a na t iona l seminar in 1997, 
and i t s recommendations were fo rma l ly adopted. Nevertheless i t remained an ex terna l ly d r iven study, 
w i t h l i t t l e rea l ownership f r om Government fo r the pover ty a l lev ia t ion agenda. 

D ia logue between the Bank, the IMF, and the Government o f Gabon was made more d i f f i c u l t by 
the lack o f loca l representation. In 1996 the Bank opened a small o f f ice in L i b r e v i l l e and assigned a 
Resident Econom is t to imp rove contact and communications w i t h the country. 
In 1997/98, w i t h 
Pres iden t ia l elections approaching, the Resident Econom is t l e d the team that prepared the 1998 CAS, in 
consultation w i t h other donors and w i t h re form-m inded members o f t h e Government. 

A. 

Long Term Strategic Goals 

The Government’s long term strategy, as described in the CAS , was to reduce i t s dependency on 
o i l revenues and foster pr iva te sector-led g row th in other areas.’ This strategy had three pillars: (a) 
ma in ta in ing a stable macroeconomic framework, (b) p rov id ing an enabling environment f o r p r iva te sector 
development, and (c) developing po l ic ies to d ive rs i fy the economy. Under macroeconomic stability, the 
Government’s stated goals were to broaden the tax base, reduce the tendency to respond “pro-cyc l ica l ly ’ ’ 
(that i s , b y increasing pub l ic expenditures and employment rather than decreasing them) to ex terna l 
shocks, and complete the ongoing program o f trade l ibera l iza t ion . The program f o r pr iva te sector 
development inc luded increasing the pace o f pr iva t iza t ion , imp rov ing the lega l and regu la tory 
environment, imp lemen t ing a Na t iona l Emp loymen t Plan, and reduc ing in fras truc ture bottlenecks, i n 
particular, adopting a strategy to guide urban development. Ac t ion to d ive rs i fy the economy w o u l d be 
based on a ru ra l development strategy that wou ld address the po ten t ia l fo r smallholder development o f 
perenn ia l crops in connection w i t h the p r iva t iza t ion o f Gabon’s ma jo r agro-enterprises, p romo t ing the 
wood transformation industry, and exp lo r ing the po ten t ia l fo r fur ther development o f fishing and tourism, 
as w e l l as support services fo r extractive industries. Pover ty a l lev ia t ion and the other Mu l t i la te ra l 
Deve lopmen t Goals (not yet articulated in 1998) did n o t appear among the Government’s l o n g te rm 
objectives. 

The C A S states that the Gabonese authorities w ished B a n k support in preparing a med ium - te rm 
development strategy that wou ld be based no t on ly on the goals ou t l ined in Gabon 2025, but also on the 
pover ty reduc t ion strategy proposed b y the Bank and adopted by Government in 1997. Based on the 
assumption that the Government agreed w i t h and accepted the Bank ’s analysis, the C A S described the 
second and third objectives o f the Government’s development agenda as “addressing deficiencies in 
human development” and “re in forc ing the capacities o f c i v i l society.” T o imp lemen t the second 
objective, i t wou ld be necessary to imp rove the de l ive ry and management o f pub l ic goods and services, 
inc lud ing hea l th and education, social protection, env ironmen ta l management, and pove r ty mon i to r ing .

The documentary basis for this strategy i s not clear. T h e CAS cites Gabon 2025, a long-term vision study prepared 
with UNDP financing. 

-53 - 

In addition, the management o f pub l ic finances wou ld need to be improved , and c i v i l service re fo rm 
w o u l d be needed to build the capacity to implement poverty-oriented reforms. The third objective, 
re in fo rc ing the capacity o f c i v i l society, was seen as a key e lemen t in imp rov ing governance and the 
sustainability o f economic reforms. 

During the C A S pe r iod and beyond, the Government made l im i ted progress towards achieving i t s 
long - te rm goals. Econom ic g row th stagnated, although non -o i l revenues increased slightly rep lac ing 
somewhat the dec l in ing o i l revenues. The tax base was broadened ma rg ina l ly and the p rog ram o f trade 
l ibe ra l iza t ion was large ly completed. However, the Government did no t succeed in adopting 
coun tercyc l ica l expenditure po l ic ies , no r did i t succeed in conv inc ing lenders to restructure o r reduce i t s 
ex terna l debt. Progress on p r iva t iza t ion was slow and uneven, despite strong support f r om the Bank and 
the IMF. Var ious reforms designed to imp rove the lega l and regulatory environment fo r the pr iva te sector 
have been prepared, and some have been adopted. However, they are yet to become e f fec t ive due to 
capacity constraints as w e l l as resistance f r om vested interests. An autonomous Road Fund was 
established to manage and ma in ta in the nation’s road network, and concessions were awarded to the 
p r iva te sector fo r the management o f key ports. M a j o r d i f f icu l t ies were encountered in an attempt to 
p r iva t ize the operations o f the ra i lway , and pre-pr iva t iza t ion restructuring has on ly just started fo r Air 
Gabon. An urban development strategy was adopted in 2000, but i t has n o t yet been implemented. As a 
result, re la t ive ly l i t t l e progress has been made on d ivers i f ica t ion o f the economy. 

During this same period, a dialogue was in i t ia ted and ma in ta ined between the Bank, supported b y 
the IMF, IFC , and other donors, and the Government, through wh ich some progress has been made 
towards developing a comm i tmen t to pover ty a l lev ia t ion and good governance as proper roles f o r the 
State. This process cu lm ina ted in the preparation o f an Interim Pover ty Reduc t ion Strategy Paper adopted 
by Government in late 2003. 

The pover ty a l lev ia t ion agenda as ou t l ined in the CAS was c lea r ly too amb i t ious g iven the l im i t e d 
Bank resources that cou ld be devoted to supporting t h i s e f fo r t . A l though current data are large ly 
unavailable and ex is t ing data are unreliable, social indicators seem to have worsened, i f anything, over the 
C A S period. Members o f the Government o f Gabon were consulted du r ing the preparation o f the CAS , 
but the Government never fo rma l ly agreed to accept i t as the ir own. 

B. 

CAS Objectives 

Based on previous experience, the C A S team concluded that p o l i c y dialogue, ESW, techn ica l 
assistance, and an active presence in Gabon had been more e f fec t ive instruments o f assistance than 
pro jec t lending. Thus, the C A S recommended that the Bank ’s assistance should be a imed at catalyzing 
domestic and in terna t iona l partners to he lp the Government address pover ty . The objectives o f the C A S 
were stated as:

Support re forms in pub l ic f inance management w i t h a focus on pover ty a l lev ia t ion sectors, 
H e l p establish or reor ien t sector strategies i n key areas where they wou ld have a d irec t impac t 
on poverty, 
Foster transparency and imp roved governance, and 
Support the p r iva t iza t ion process wh i le leverag ing other donor resources in support o f p r iva te 
sector development. 

The CAS envisaged tw o assistance scenarios fo r the pe r iod 1999-2001. Unde r the Base Case, 
macro-economic s tab i l i ty wou ld be ma in ta ined as evidenced by comp l iance w i t h an IMF program; the 
Government wou ld make satisfactory progress in fo rmu la t ing a Med ium -Te rm Expend i ture Framework 

-54- 

fo r health, education, and ru ra l development; progress on pr iva t iza t ion wou ld continue; and the B a n k 
po r t fo l io w o u l d rema in in satisfactory status. G iven t h i s scenario, the Bank envisaged tw o new lend ing 
operations, a Pub l ic Sector Re form TA Loan and a Ra i lway Rehab i l i ta t ion Project, as w e l l as substantial 
non- lend ing support to imp rove budget management and the effectiveness of social sector expenditures. 
The L o w Case w o u l d be triggered b y a lack o f compliance w i t h any o f the above criteria, and w o u l d 
invo lve no new lend ing operations and a more l im i ted p rov is ion o f non- lend ing services. 

Spec i f ic actions and progress indicators were set out in an annex table, organized around the three 
p i l la rs o f (i) fos ter ing non -o i l pr iva te sector led growth, (ii) strengthening pub l ic sector effectiveness and 
e f f ic iency , and (iii) bu i ld ing c i v i l society capacity (see Annex A to this report). The ma t r ix showed 
proposed outcomes and progress indicators fo r the Government o f Gabon as w e l l as fo r the B a n k 
program. In fact, the achievement o f the Bank program depended heav i ly on the Government’s do ing i t s 
part; 
the Bank p rog ram was ma in ly to p rov ide technical advice and to comment on Government 
proposals. The ma t r ix shows that the strategy re l ied heav i ly on p o l i c y advice to accomplish the 
objectives, and also on the cooperation o f other development partners. A summary table on the f o l l ow i n g 
page shows the C A S objectives and the instruments that were expected to help achieve those objectives. 
A l though l i t t l e n ew lend ing was proposed, the strategy re l ied on sector dialogue that was ongo ing under 
ex is t ing projects ( T r a n s p o f l r b a n TA, Forestry and Env ironmen t , and Pr iva t iza t ion TA) and the 
demonstration effects expected f r om the recen t ly approved U rban LIL. In addition, an IDF grant had 
recen t ly been approved to he lp the Government increase capacity in the c i v i l service. 

The lend ing and non- lend ing programs foreseen in the CAS and actual results are shown in 
Annexes 2 and 3. The CAS promised that key parameters, inc lud ing s h i f t s in the numbers o f peop le 
be low the pove r ty l ine , increases i n educational attainment, l i f e expectancy, and changes in in fan t 
mo r ta l i ty and AIDS mo rb id i ty wou ld be mon i tored i n co l labora t ion w i t h Gabonese authorities, w h i l e 
semi-annual j o i n t IM F / B a n k missions wou ld mon i to r macroeconomic performance. 
CAS ca l led f o r the Bank to p lay the ro le o f “Know ledge Bank” fo r Gabon rather than that o f a trad i t iona l

Implementation. Gabon has wavered in and out o f the Base Case since 1998. Comp l iance with 
IMF programs has been uneven; substantial slippage occurred in the imp lemen ta t ion o f the 1995-97 
Ex tended Fund Fac i l i ty and the 18-month Standby Arrangement approved in 2000. Problems in 
macroeconomic management were experienced in 1998 when o i l revenues exceeded expectations, and 
again in 2002/3 in connection w i t h mun ic ipa l and parliamentary elections. However , in each case the 
authorities took steps to put the country back on track. The Bank and the IMF have wo rked c lose ly 
together to carry ou t the macroeconomic dialogue and to support the development o f domestic budget 
management capacity. Progress on pr iva t iza t ion has continued, albeit s low ly , and the Bank sma l l 
po r t fo l io has genera l ly remained in satisfactory status. However, counterpart funding o f ongo ing pro jec ts 
has been s low t o materialize, and disbursements have been slow, necessitating the repeated extension o f 
ex is t ing projects in order to accomplish the ir objectives. The Government, w i t h the support o f UND P , 
has taken i n i t i a l steps towards preparing a pover ty reduc t ion strategy, but has no t ye t reached the po in t o f 
fo rmu la t ing a Med ium -Te rm Expend i ture Framework fo r health, education, and ru ra l development. 

T o assist the Government in prepar ing the proposed Pub l ic Sector Re fo rm TA Loan, the Bank 
secured a P H R D grant o f $750,000 to Gabon in August 1999. A unit was set up w i t h i n the P lann ing 
M i n i s t r y to coordinate pro jec t preparation. The grant was to be used (1) to he lp finance the development 
o f social sector strategies, (2) to support an expenditure programm ing and debt management workshop 
and a p i l o t debt swap, and (3) to develop pover ty indicators and projections as a baseline fo r the fu ture 
PRSP. The grant was administered b y the Bank and financed the con tr ibu t ions o f several in terna t iona l 
consultants. However , the Government did no t consider that the wo rk o f these consultants responded to 
the ir p r io r i ty needs. In response, the Bank agreed to reorient the agenda more towards macroeconomic 
management than pover ty a l lev ia t ion . U l t ima te ly , however, the Government in fo rmed the Bank that i t 
did n o t in tend to f o l l ow through w i t h a request fo r a Pub l ic Sector Re fo rm TA Loan. The Bank then 
o f fe red to he lp prepare and supervise the pro jec t (wh ich the Government said i t wou ld finance w i t h 
domestic resources), i f the Government wou ld reimburse the Bank’s costs. The Government refused t h i s 
o f fer , and the Bank closed the P H R D grant on June 30,2001. The Pub l ic Sector Re fo rm TA L o a n did n o t 
materialize.* 

Po l icy dialogue continued through ongo ing consultations w i t h the B a nM IM F team and through

preparation. 

The P r iva t iza t ion TA project, approved in FY 97, carried much o f the burden o f imp lemen t ing the 
1998 CAS goals related to pr iva te sector development. 
I t was moderately successful in do ing so, 
a l though progress was slower than anticipated. The pro jec t has funded studies and d irec t techn ica l 
assistance to the Government, no t on ly in the f ie ld o f privatization, but also in broader capacity b u i l d i n g 
ac t iv i t ies re la ted t o the creation o f an enabling environment, inc lud ing a lega l framework, fo r p r iva te 
sector development. Goals that were established fo r FY 0 1 are nearing accomplishment towards the end 
o f FY 04. O r i g i n a l l y scheduled to close in June 2001, t h e pro jec t was extended three times and closed in 
June 2004. 

The U r b a n LIL, approved just p r io r to the 1998 CAS , has made a substantial con tr ibu t ion w i t h a 
strong demonstration effect in mob i l iz ing urban neighborhoods to imp rove the ir l i v i n g conditions and in 
strengthening the capacity o f sma l l contractors. Expected to close i n December 2001, the pro jec t was 
extended tw ice and closed in June 2004. I t has successfully modeled a par t ic ipa tory approach to small- 
scale in fras truc ture p lann ing w i t h the invo lvemen t o f loca l (chefs de qua r t ie r ) and mun ic ipa l authorities. 
I t has succeeded in generating employment in the urban neighborhoods selected fo r the pro jec t and in 
s t imu la t ing the g row th of sma l l enterprises. Recently, the pro jec t unit ( fo rme r ly the unit in charge o f the 
T r a n s p o f l r b a n TA Project) has conducted a rev iew o f planned pub l ic expenditures in the hea l th and 
education sectors to iden t i fy add i t iona l infrastructure projects that cou ld be carried out using a s im i la r 
approach, thus p rov id ing sustainability to the project. I t i s be l ieved that a new lend ing operation w i l l be 
needed to sustain Government comm i tmen t and scale up the program t o meet t h e needs o f Gabon’s urban 
population. 

D ia logue in the transport sector has continued w i t h the a im o f preparing the ground f o r the 
proposed Ra i lway Rehab i l i ta t ion Project or a s im i lar operation. However , the process o f concessioning 
the ra i lways encountered numerous d i f f icu l t ies . Other problems cropped up i n the management o f the 
pub l ic expenditure program in transport, wh ich has no t always been consistent w i t h the transport sector 
strategy adopted under the Transport/Urban TA Project. In short, the p o l i c y environment never reached 
the po in t where an investment in ra i lway rehab i l i ta t ion cou ld be jus t i f ied , and the pro jec t was f ina l ly 
dropped f r om the lend ing program. Thus, there has been no new lend ing to Gabon since the 1998 CAS 
was approved. 

Non - lend ing support has been prov ided through con t inu ing po l icy dialogue i n v o l v i n g the IMF 
and the W o r l d Bank, as w e l l as a j o i n t F inanc ia l Sector Assessment carr ied out in FY 03. The Bank also 
assisted the Government in deve lop ing a new Procurement Code, adopted in FY 03. The planned Ru ra l 
Development Strategy was never budgeted by the Bank, as the Government expressed no interest in i t . 
In te rna l Bank resources were allocated fo r a Coun try Econom ic Memorandum, but no memorandum has 
yet been produced. The pos i t ion o f Resident Econom is t was upgraded to Resident Representative in 
1999, and s ta f f and log is t ica l support were added to the Coun t ry O f f ice . However, the new Resident 
Representative did no t succeed in establishing a cons truc t ive dialogue w i t h Government. H e returned to 
Washington in 2001, and the post remained vacant until January 2003, when the current Resident 
Representative arr ived in Gabon. 

Generally, the ongo ing projects have rema ined in satisfactory status. Ove ra l l some p o l i c y 
dialogue has been carr ied out, and certain po l icy changes have been accomplished. Some projects had a 
s low s t a r t because o f the un fam i l ia r i ty o f pro jec t s t a f f w i t h Bank procedures after a long pe r iod when the 
Bank had no t been invo lved in that sector. T ime ly counterpart funding has always been a problem, and 

-58- 

the need fo r close con t ro l o f procurement ac t iv i t ies has also slowed  disbursement^.^ As a result, a l l the 
ongo ing pro jec ts have been extended to the limit, typ ica l ly tak ing three more years t o complete than 
o r ig ina l ly planned. 

The C A S iden t i f ied three short-term risks to the Bank’s strategy: 
(1) delays f o l l ow i n g the 
fo r thcom ing pres iden t ia l elections; (2) reg iona l ins tab i l i ty due to c i v i l unrest in ne ighbor ing countries, 
and (iii) fur ther declines i n o i l and commod i ty prices. Over the longer term, ma jo r risks re la ted to 
progress (or lack thereof) on governance and ins t i tu t iona l capacity issues. The short-term risks did n o t 
materialize. Presidential elections took place as scheduled and d id no t cause ma jor delays, although they 
may have been re la ted to some slippage in the imp lemen ta t ion o f the IMF program. Unres t d i d occur in 
ne ighbor ing countries, pa r t icu la r ly Congo and CAR , but this has no t resulted in s ign i f ican t spillovers, 
either o f con f l ic t o r o f refugees, i n t o Gabon. O i l and commod i ty prices have f luc tua ted but have n o t 
declined enough to jeopardize the imp lemen ta t ion o f the Government’s expenditure programs. 
I t was 
s low progress on governance and ins t i tu t iona l capacity bu i ld ing that impeded the imp lemen ta t ion o f 
ongo ing pro jec ts and the development o f new lending. 

The C A S did no t foresee the risk o f the Government’s taking advantage o f Bank techn ica l 
assistance and grant support w i thou t f o l l ow i n g up by borrow ing . I t was correct in iden t i fy ing the longer- 
te rm risks, but fa i led to recognize that these same r i s k s cou ld have s ign i f ican t short-term effects that 
wou ld impede the rea l iza t ion o f CAS objectives. 

Fostering non-oil private sector-led growth. Performance in this area was m ixed . M a n y o f the 
specific actions iden t i f ied in the CAS as performance indicators have in fac t been carr ied out (a l though 
many wou ld no t have been done b y the end o f the o f f i c i a l C A S per iod in October 2001). With respect to 
the maintenance o f macro-economic stability, the Government has per formed reasonably w e l l on the 
revenue side, but has no t succeeded in con t ro l l ing expenditures or in s ign i f ican t ly reduc ing external debt. 
Some capacity bu i ld ing has taken place, but more i s probab ly needed; more impor tan t i s the fac t that 
techn ica l ly competent c i v i l servants are unable to impose f inanc ia l d isc ip l ine on po l i t ica l decision- 
makers. O n trade promotion, the necessary actions have la rge ly been taken. The p r iva t iza t ion p rog ram 
has continued w i t h moderate success, although substantial resistance has been encountered w i t h respect to 
transport, telecommunications and postal services. One goa l that seems un l ike ly to be me t before the end 
o f 2004 i s the creation o f a mu tua l fund f o r the placement o f Government-owned m i n o r i t y shares w i t h the 
pub l ic . 

W i t h regard to the legal, regulatory, and ins t i tu t iona l framework fo r p r iva te sector development, 
the results are also mixed. N e w M i n i n g and Forestry Codes (but no Pe tro leum Code) have been adopted, 
and revisions to the L a w on Compe t i t ion , the Labo r Code, and the Soc ia l Security Code have been 
studied and discussed, though no t yet adopted. Studies are s t i l l underway fo r the res truc tur ing o f the 
Na t iona l Social Security Fund. P r ice controls have been large ly eliminated, but rema in on i tems o f 
“primary n e ~ e s s i t y . ” ~ The Department o f P r ice Con tro ls has been lega l ly renamed as the Department o f 
Competition, but i t s administrative cu l ture remains unchanged and the pub l ic i s unclear about i t s new 
responsibilities. Some t ra in ing has been p rov ided to the jud ic ia ry , and the Journal o f i c i e l has been 
pub l ished regu lar ly . N e w ins t i tu t ions have been established to regulate and promo te the pr iva te sector, 
but their capacity requires considerable strengthening in order fo r them to be e f fec t ive . N o regu la tory 
agency has yet been established fo r the recen t ly p r iva t ized water and e lec tr ic i ty services.

In the case o f the ForestryEhvironment Project, the 1993 devaluation also doubled the funds available (and the 
requirements for local counterpart contributions), which contributed to delays i n implementation. 
The continuation o f price controls on primary commodities (including pharmaceuticals, petroleum products, bread, 
sugar, school materials and supplies) i s part of a recently negotiated agreement between Government, industry, and labor, 
whereby labor has promised to refrain from strikes for a period o f three years, and Government w i l l pay i t s debts to the private 
sector.

The s i tua t ion o f the f inanc ia l sector i s re la t ive ly satisfactory, although banks rema in exposed to 
risk f r om loans t o pub l ic enterprises and government suppliers, as w e l l as f r om the narrow (non- 
d ivers i f ied) base o f pr iva te investment. Access to m icro-cred i t has very recen t ly improved , w i t h support 
f r om AfDB and b i la te ra l donors. However, the situation w i t h respect to cred i t fo r small and med ium 
enterprises and industries i s s t i l l no t very satisfactory. Large numbers o f loans outstanding and new 
requirements fo r group guarantees limit the capacity o f bank ing ins t i tu t ions to respond to the needs o f t h i s 
sub-sector. L i t t l e progress has been made w i t h respect to adapting the labor force to meet market needs. 
In the transport sector, the re fo rm agenda set fo r th i n the transport sector strategy has been on ly partly 
implemented. As a result, transport costs related to in terna t iona l trade have no t declined s ign i f ican t ly . 

Strengthening public sector effectiveness and efficiency. Performance in t h i s area has been 

disappointing. With respect t o administrative reform, the program i s proceeding s low ly . This i s partly 
due to a recogn i t ion that changes in administrative structure should fo l low , rather than precede, the 
elaboration o f sector strategies in the context o f a na t iona l development strategy based on pove r ty 
reduc t ion as w e l l as economic growth. The CAS assumed that sector strategies wou ld be prepared shor t ly 
after the PA workshop, and that administrative reforms wou ld f o l l ow in due course. 
In fact, the 
preparation o f sector strategies related to pover ty reduc t ion has been slowed by data d i f f icu l t ies , pa r t ly 
re f lec t ing a lack o f po l i t ica l w i l l , and has no t been fo l lowed closely by the Bank . 

Re la t ive ly l i t t l e has been accomplished in t e rm s o f imp rov ing the management o f pub l ic finances. 
Some studies wh ich were to have been financed under the PHRD grant, concerning development o f a debt 
management strategy and p romo t ion o f the country’s competitiveness, did no t take p lace because the 
grant was cancelled. Lack ing sectoral strategies, t h e Government was unab le to develop a Med ium -Te rm 
Expend i ture Framework . A budgetary in fo rma t ion system has been put in p lace w i t h support f r om the 
Bank and IMF. However , i t i s s t i l l too soon to say i f this system w i l l e f fec t ive ly imp rove expenditure 
con tro l . A pover ty mon i to r ing system has no t been put in place, a l though funds f r o m the P H R D grant 
were used to support a Demographic and Hea l th Survey carr ied out in 2000 wh ich cou ld p rov ide some 
data elements fo r such a system. The A f r i c a Capacity B u i l d i n g Founda t ion has carr ied out some training 
f o r parliamentarians, but t h i s support has no t enabled Parliament to exercise rea l budgetary oversight so 
far . 

In the hea l th and education sectors, progress was also l im i t e d by the lack o f ac t ion on sector 
strategies. Under the P H R D grant, support was prov ided fo r the preparation o f a car te scolaire and a 
car te san i ta ire , as w e l l as fo r a study on education unit costs. The unit cost study was completed, but the 
tw o cartes are s t i l l in preparation. When the Bank was no longer ac t ive ly invo lved , other U.N. agencies 
stepped in to he lp the Government w o r k on these sector strategies. Un for tuna te ly , severe data 
deficiencies have greatly constrained the effectiveness o f the ir support. Meanwh i le , soc ia l indicators 
appear to have worsened over the C A S period.6 With respect to social protection, the on ly progress made 
was the reassignment o f f inanc ia l respons ib i l i ty fo r three hospitals f r o m the Na t iona l Soc ia l Security 
Fund to the Ministry o f Hea l th . The continued v iab i l i ty o f Gabon’s social pro tec t ion system i s n ow 
seriously in question, w i t h dec l in ing revenues and rising rates o f unemployment. On env ironmen ta l 
protection, despite an ambitious C A S agenda, l i t t l e has been done either b y the Bank o r b y Government, 
except in the context o f the Fo res t ryEnv i ronmen t Project.’

The B a n k did no t f o l l ow through on i t s prom ise to conduct an In fo rma t ion Assessment fo r 
Gabon. In add i t ion to the Demographic and Hea l th Survey mentioned above, the Government conducted 
i t s decennial census in 2003; however, this d i d no t inc lude household budget in forma t ion , and the results 
w i l l no t be ava i lab le fo r some time. A recent Bank m iss ion in the context o f the PRSP assisted the 
Government in de f in ing a survey wh ich cou ld be carr ied out qu ick ly and cou ld p rov ide the basic data on 
wh ich a pove r ty mon i to r ing strategy cou ld be built. The Bank i s now he lp ing the Government seek grant 
funds to ca r ry ou t such a survey, in order to prepare a satisfactory PRSP be fore the end o f calendar 2004. 
However , the broader agenda o f p romo t ing transparency and pub l ic invo lvemen t through dissemination 
o f government in fo rma t ion has hard ly been addressed, as shown by the consultations undertaken in- 
coun try f o r this repor t . 

Building civil society capacity. The CAS agenda in this area was n o t very exp l ic i t , and i t 
depended to a great extent on the activities o f other partners. Tw o c lear ly stated objectives, the adop t ion 
o f a F am i l y Code and the adoption o f a Na t iona l I E C Strategy, were no t accomplished. The Bank did no t 
p rov ide any p rac t ica l support fo r these objectives. L i t t l e was done to b u i l d the capacity o f domestic 
NGOs , either b y the Bank or b y other donors.’ The program o f the A f r i c a Capacity B u i l d i n g Founda t ion 
did no t extend to NGOs . The Bank team did no t take action, as promised, to invo lve ED1 (WB I ) in t h i s 
area. W i thou t any par t icu lar he lp f r om the Bank , the Government succeeded in ma in ta in ing c i v i l peace 
and p rov id ing leadership fo r the resolution o f reg iona l con f l ic ts . 

Exogenous factors. The imp lemen ta t ion o f the Government’s program has been perturbed f r om 
t ime to t ime by f luc tua t ions in o i l revenue and b y c i v i l con f l ic t in ne ighbor ing countries. However, these 
events were no t o f su f f ic ien t magnitude to be considered ma jor ex terna l shocks. The Government has 
remained remarkab ly stable over the pe r iod (and indeed, over the last fo r ty years). 
I t has become 
increas ing ly aware of the burden o f external debt and the l im i ta t ions that this imposes on i t s ab i l i ty t o 
alleviate pover ty , especially i n the context o f dec l in ing o i l revenues and the inherent weaknesses o f the 
ren t red is tr ibu t ion system. The Government, w i t h the support o f U N D P has prepared an In te r im PRSP 
and i s curren t ly wo rk ing on a full PRSP w i t h assistance f r om the Bank. 

Unintended impacts. Because o f the re la t ive ly l i g h t “ foo tpr in t” o f the Bank ’s program in Gabon, 
there have n o t been any unintended negative consequences, social or environmental, during the pe r iod 
covered by the CAS . The Fores try lEnv ironmen t Pro jec t made a sma l l con tr ibu t ion to imp rov ing the 
management o f ex is t ing protected areas, complemented by the ac t iv i t ies o f other donors. Imp lemen ta t ion 
o f sustainable forest management practices through app l ica t ion o f the rev ised Forestry Code may be o f 
greater significance to Gabon’s future. The fa i lu re to develop a Pe tro leum Code means that an 
oppor tun i ty to address the environmental aspects o f this key sector has been missed. The T ranspo rW rban 
TA pro jec t was expected to support preparation o f env ironmen ta l assessment guidelines fo r the transport 
and urban sectors, but these were g iven a lowe r p r i o r i t y than other planned outputs and were no t 
accomplished under the pro jec t . 

On the social side, there i s considerable pub l ic concern about the p r iva t iza t ion p rog ram go ing 
ahead in the absence of funding fo r social plans fo r a f fec ted employees. In fact, this has no t happened, 
but i t i s one o f the reasons for delayed imp lemen ta t ion o f the p r iva t iza t ion program. O r ig ina l ly the social 
plans were to have been funded by an AfDB loan. F o r a while, t h i s funding was in terrup ted due to non- 
payment o f Gabon’s arrears to AfDB, and consequently some p r iva t iza t ion ac t iv i t ies cou ld n o t be 
completed according to schedule. This p rob lem has n ow been reso lved and AfDB fund ing has been 
resumed; wh i le the Bank‘s pro jec t w i l l come to an end in June 2004.

Measuring Bank Performance 

Quality of products and services. Generally, where the Bank managed t o be present, i t s 
con tr ibu t ions in the areas o f bo th lend ing and non-lending are regarded as hav ing been o f high qua l i ty . 
The U rban LIL has received numerous commendations fo r excellence. The two pro jec ts closed during 
the C A S pe r iod (T ranspodu rban TA and Fores tryEnv ironmen t) have been rated as satisfactory, though 
sustainability i s be l ieved to depend on fo l low -on lend ing operations. The Bank has wo rked closely w i t h 
the IMF and also w i t h I F C and MIGA to assist the Government in ach iev ing i t s objectives o f 
d ive rs i f ica t ion away f r om o i l and p romo t ing g row th through pr iva te sector development. 

There have been three Q A G reviews o f operations in Gabon during the C A S period: a Qua l i ty at 
Entry rev iew o f the U rban LIL in 1998, a Qua l i ty o f Supervision assessment o f the same pro jec t in 2002, 
and Qua l i ty o f Supervision o f R isky Projects rev iew o f the Fo res t ryEnv i ronmen t Pro jec t in 2000 
(prev ious ly rev iewed b y Q A G in 1997). The U rban LIL was rated H i g h l y Satisfactory at en try and 
Satisfactory in supervision. The Fo res t ryEnv i ronmen t Project was rated Ma rg ina l ly Satisfactory in l i g h t 
o f the Government’s lack o f early comm i tmen t and substantially delayed implementation. 

The C A S ou t l ined an ambitious agenda wh ich was supported b y a small, though well-placed, 
cadre o f re form-m inded members o f the Gabon Government. I t did n o t have broad based ownership at 
the time, pa r t icu la r ly w i t h respect to the objectives o f p romo t ing greater transparency in government and 
a stronger focus on pover ty a l lev ia t ion in pub l ic expenditure management. W h i l e the Government agreed 
in pr inc ip le , i t was u nw i l l i n g to bo r row (on IBRD terms) fo r the imp lemen ta t ion o f such activities. There 
was also l i k e l y to be strong resistance on the part o f vested interests in the d i f feren t sectors, as i l lus t ra ted 
b y the experience o f ongoing projects in transport and forestry as w e l l as b y the p r iva t iza t ion program. 
D u r i n g the C A S period, the Bank w ise ly re fra ined f r om pushing the Government to prepare new lend ing 
operations, instead devoting i t s l im i ted budget to p o l i c y dialogue and supervision o f ongo ing operations. 
Over time, through extended dialogue w i t h the Bank and IMF and other members o f the donor 
commun i ty , and w i t h grant support extended by other b i la te ra l or mu l t i la te ra l donors, the Government has 
gained greater understanding o f the need fo r imp rov ing transparency, as par t o f i t s e f for ts to promo te 
pr iva te investment, and fo r addressing re la t ive pover ty . 
F r om the Bank’s po in t o f v iew the need to limit in terven t ion to those sectors in wh ich Gabon i s 
w i l l i n g to accept help f r om the Bank means that i n practice Bank support i s concentrated in the 
in fras truc ture and PSD sectors, wh i le education, health, and ru ra l development (except fo r forestry) go 
unsupported b y the Bank. Con t inu ing poo r performance by Gabon on the development ind ica tors used to 
program Bank budgets l i m i t s the resources available to p rov ide “free” technical assistance. A large share 
o f these resources i s consumed b y j o i n t s t a f f w o r k w i t h the IMF and b y the costs o f ma in ta in ing a f u l l y 
equipped Coun try O f f ice . L im i t e d resources also have a demora l iz ing e f fec t on the B a n k coun try team. 
L a c k o f oppor tun i ty to wo rk on Gabon means that the coun try gets a l o w p r i o r i t y f r o m sector managers 
and h i g h turnover among technical staff. Gabon has had six d i f feren t Coun try Economists over the past 
s ix years, and fo r tw o years was w i thou t a Coun try Econom is t a l l together. 

In -coun t ry consultations on the results o f the C A S revea l that i t s structure and contents were 
v i r tua l ly unknown outside the M i n i s t r y o f Planning, and even by some m id - leve l o f f ic ia ls w i t h i n the 
M in is t ry . A l though the C A S was translated in to French, no copy in French cou ld be found anywhere in 
Government, in the Resident M iss ion f i les , o r in Washington. The English copy in the M i n i s t r y o f P lan 
f i les d id no t inc lude Annex B9 , the performance ma t r ix . G iven this lack o f in fo rma t ion , mos t 
in ter locu tors refused to comment d i rec t ly on the results o f the CAS . The i r comments revealed a m is taken 
be l ie f that the Bank (in co l labora t ion w i t h the IMF and the in terna t iona l commun i ty ) i s on ly concerned

They thought the Bank had abandoned the pover ty agenda. They see l i t t l e bene f i t to Gabon f r o m 
pr iva t iza t ion , and fear the consequences i n terms o f unemployment and social unrest. A common theme 
was resentment abou t no t be ing considered e l ig ib le fo r IDA funding ( inc lud ing f o r H I V / A I D S ) or f o r the 
H I P C In i t ia t ive . 

The Bank did no t meet the lend ing targets established in the CAS, as they were no t consistent 
w i t h the rea l in ten t ions o f the Government (Annex B). Coun try dialogue and coord ina t ion w i t h other 
donors has continued, when a bank representative was present in the country, in an e f fo r t to prepare the 
ground fo r fu ture lend ing operations that may be more l i k e l y to prove sustainable. In the meantime, the 
successful execution o f ongoing operations has developed support f o r the ir continuation, and created 
domestic capacity to prepare and carry out new operations in these sectors. 

The 1998 CAS did no t present clear targets and dates fo r non- lend ing deliverables (see Annex C). 
The prom ised R u r a l Sector Strategy and In fo rma t ion Management Assessment were no t delivered. A 
Coun try Econom ic Memorandum was no t promised, but was budgeted, a l though no t delivered as a 
document. On the other hand considerable unplanned non- lend ing support has been prov ided in response 
to requests f r om the Government and other development partners (notably the IMF). The subjects o f this 
support ( f inanc ia l sector assessment, rev iew o f the procurement code , budget management in fo rma t ion 
system, pover ty mon i to r ing ) were consistent w i t h CAS objectives, although they are d i f feren t f r om wha t 
was foreseen in the CAS . They re f lec t a g row ing emphasis on governance issues, w i t h a corresponding 
decreased emphasis on pove r ty issues. 

Portfolio assessment. With fou r projects in the po r t fo l io in 1999, and on ly tw o after 2001, 
po r t fo l io indicators based on averages cou ld be misleading. Disbursement ratios reached a h i g h o f 48.2 in 
2001 when the Fo res t ryEnv i ronmen t Pro jec t came to a close, dropped t o 28.9 in the nex t year and rose to 
35.5 in 2004. B o t h ongo ing projects (Pr iva t iza t ion TA and U rban LIL) were ra ted as projects at risk and 
p rob lem projects in 2003, but these problems were resolved and the risk ra t ing removed by 2004. 
Typ ica l ly , projects have taken longer than expected to be implemented, w i t h a current average o f 6.2 
years. Three completed projects have been evaluated b y O E D in the las t f i v e years (T ranspodu rban TA, 
Fores tryEnv ironmen t , and the Reg iona l Env ironmen ta l In fo rma t ion Management) and have been rated 
Satisfactory or Modera te ly Satisfactory. 

Country dialogue. The 1998 CAS was developed w i t h the support o f a Coun t ry D i rec to r who 
placed a p r io r i ty on Gabon as a po ten t ia l economic leader and guarantor o f social peace in the Cen tra l 
A f r ican sub-region. As one tangible ind ica tor o f t h i s p r io r i ty , the pos i t ion o f Resident Economist was 
upgraded to that o f a Resident Representative, and the Bank o f f i c i a l l y opened a Coun t ry O f f ice in Gabon. 
The new Resident Representative was faced w i t h the task o f imp lemen t ing a CAS that did no t en joy 
widespread Government ownership. A t the same time, the Coun try D i rec to r l e f t the pos i t ion and a year 
la ter l e f t the Bank and was replaced by a D i rec to r who did no t share h i s views. Misunderstandings arose 
between the Bank and the Government concerning the extent and nature o f p lanned Bank support. T o 
complicate matters, bo th the Bank and the Government were sending m i x e d messages through the var ie ty 
o f interlocutors invo lved in the dialogue. The Resident Representative was unable t o manage t h i s process 
and had no con t ro l over the a l loca t ion o f the coun try budget. There was on ly pa r t ia l comm i tmen t on the 
part o f the Coun try Team, since the administrative budget was unab le to cover a l l the ir costs. The 
Resident Representative returned to Washington in 2001 and the pos i t ion rema ined vacant until a new 
Resident Representative took up the assignment in January 2003. 

Under the circumstances, i t i s remarkable that po l icy d ia logue has con t inued as w e l l as i t has. 
This seems to be ma in ly due t o con t inued close co l labora t ion between the Bank and the IMF, even though 

-63- 

there has been l i t t l e con t inu i ty in the Coun try Economist position. The Bank has continued t o p rov ide 
d irec t support t o he lp the Government meet IMF conditions, through such ac t iv i t ies as preparation o f a 
Procurement Code and a F inanc ia l Sector Assessment. The Bank‘s Fore ign Investment Adv iso ry Service 
(FIAS) i s prepar ing a diagnostic rev iew as par t o f a program to he lp imp rove the investment c l ima te f o r 
the p r iva te sector. The Bank has backed away f r om the pover ty a l lev ia t ion agenda, recogn iz ing tha t the 
Government w o u l d no t be ready to receive Bank support in this area fo r a long time. Consequently, m u c h 
o f the necessary preparation wo rk has been l e f t to other donors. However, now that Gabon has adopted 
an I-PRSP, the Bank has begun to p rov ide support fo r the preparation o f a full PRSP wh ich w i l l be 
actionable and acceptable to the donor commun i ty . 

D. 

Consu ltat ion and Coord inat ion w i th Development Partners 

Coord ina ted action w i t h other development partners was absolutely essential to ach iev ing the 
CAS goals. Cons ider ing that Gabon’s requirements fo r in terna t iona l assistance are re la t ive ly l im i ted , a 
remarkable number of donors are present in the country, inc lud ing several U.N. agencies. France, the 
European Un ion , and Canada are key b i la tera l partners. The A f r ican Development Bank (AfDB) i s also 
active in Gabon. 
Indeed, the imp lemen ta t ion o f some pr iva t iza t ion ac t iv i t ies were delayed when the 
AfDB, w h i c h had approved lend ing i n support o f t ra in ing and “social reinsertion” o f retrenched workers, 
suspended disbursements to Gabon due to accumulated arrears. The prob lem was resolved and AfDB 
lend ing t o Gabon resumed on ly in 2003. 

U N D P has assisted the Government in prepar ing i t s Na t iona l Env ironmen ta l A c t i o n Plan, and, 
more recently, i t s I n t e r im PRSP. I t has also assisted in strengthening economic management capacity b y 
conduc t ing seminars and workshops in technical m in is tr ies . W H O p rov ided support fo r the development 
of a hea l th sector strategy and action plan. UNESCO has carr ied out some studies in support o f a fu ture 
education sector strategy. The U.N. Fund fo r Popu la t ion Ac t iv i t ies (UNFPA) planned to p rov ide support 
fo r the development o f a na t iona l I E C strategy and f o r N G O capacity building. However , these ac t iv i t ies 
did no t ma ter ia l ize . The I LO has been invo lved in rev is ing the Labo r Code but i t has not been able to 
participate in p lann ing educational re forms to produce a labor force better adapted to meet the needs o f 
pr iva te investors. 

During the C A S period, Gabon agreed to “host” 
the Reg iona l Env i ronmen ta l In fo rma t ion 
Management Pro jec t (RE IMP) supported b y GEF. The Government o f Gabon was the o f f i c i a l grant 
recipient, but the funds were immed ia te ly forwarded to an in terna t iona l N G O (ADIE) established under 
Gabon law , but independent o f the Government, to execute the pro jec t . The R E IM P collaborated c lose ly 
w i t h the Fo res tEnv i ronmen t Project in i t s later stages, and this co l labora t ion i s l i k e l y to spill over i n t o a 
GEF grant fo r Gabon associated w i t h the fu ture Fo res tEnv i ronmen t Sector Program. An anticipated 
co l labora t ion w i t h WWF to execute a debt-for-nature swap did n o t materialize, due to the unw i l l ingness 
o f Government to use PHRD funds to support the necessary studies, and the inab i l i ty o f the Bank to 
supply the services o f an expert. 

Gabon also plays a lead ing ro le in the Cen tra l A f r ican Econom ic and Mone ta ry U n i o n (CEMAC ) , 
and in t h i s con tex t i s a l inchp in fo r the Bank’s strategy t o promo te reg iona l in tegra t ion i n Cen t ra l A f r ica . 
This strategy w i l l prov ide technical assistance to the C E M A C countries fo r trade fac i l i ta t ion , customs 
reform, bank ing sector mon i to r ing and marke t development, m icro f inance , road infrastructure, a i r safety, 
and ins t i tu t iona l strengthening. Consultations in Gabon showed that stakeholders are expecting that 
Gabon w i l l bene f i t f r om Bank f inanc ia l par t ic ipa t ion in reg iona l road in fras truc ture improvemen ts and in 
m icro f inance in i t ia t ives . I t i s to be hoped that these expectations w i l l no t be disappointed due to the fac t 
that Gabon i s requ ired to bo r row on IBRD terms. 

-64- 

Some in i t ia t ives that were expected to be undertaken together w i t h partners did no t ma ter ia l ize , 
due to changes in Bank and Government priorities. Fo r example, the Bank did n o t pursue the prepara t ion 
o f a Ru ra l Deve lopmen t Strategy fo r Gabon, w i t h wh ich France was w i l l i n g to assist. S im i la r ly , U N D P 
and Canada were prepared to support e f for ts to imp rove access to m icro-cred i t and cred i t f o r sma l l and 
med ium enterprises, i n tandem w i t h Bank e f for ts to develop a loca l market f o r government shares in 
former pub l ic enterprises. As this agenda has no t progressed very far, the framework f o r such 
co l labora t ion has no t yet been established. France and the European Investment Bank had expressed 
interest in co f inanc ing the Ra i lway Rehab i l i ta t ion operation. I t i s n ow proceeding w i t h the ir funding but 
w i thou t Bank par t ic ipa t ion . Several b i la tera l donors have expressed w i l l ingness to support fu ture 
operations in the social sectors, once the Bank has determined that sound and sustainable sector strategies 
are in place. 

Gabon has p layed a lead ing ro le in the imp lemen ta t ion o f the A f r i c a Capacity Building 
Founda t ion (ACBF ) , and A C B F was expected to contribute s ign i f ican t ly to ins t i tu t iona l strengthening in 
Gabon during the CAS period. A pro jec t fo r capacity building in economic and f inanc ia l management 
(PRECAGEF) was put in place but per formed poo r ly under i t s first pro jec t manager. In fo rma t ion about 
opportunities p rov ided b y the pro jec t was no t w ide ly disseminated, and programs were no t w e l l designed 
to meet rea l needs fo r s k i l l development. This pro jec t i s curren t ly be ing restructured. The C A S also 
prom ised that the country team wou ld so l ic i t ED1 support fo r a parliamentary capacity bu i ld ing p rog ram 
in Gabon. Apparen t ly this did no t take place. I F C ho lds s ign i f ican t investments in Gabon in the o i l and 
mining sectors, and prov ided techn ica l support du r ing the pr iva t iza t ion o f e lec t r ic i ty and water services. 
During the C A S period, I F C made a $18 m i l l i o n investment in the operations o f V A A L C O Gabon, a 
subsidiary o f V A A L C O Energy, Inc., responsible f o r developing the Etame Ma r ine offshore o i l f ie ld . 

During C A S preparation, a par t ic ipa tory process was fo l lowed wh ich i s described i n Annex D o f 
the CAS . I t portrays the C A S as a d irec t outcome o f the Pover ty Assessment par t ic ipa tory process, as 
w e l l as par t ic ipa tory strategic p lann ing undertaken under the Transport/Urban TA pro jec t . I t also refers to 
a Pub l ic Expend i ture Rev iew undertaken b y the Resident Econom is t wh ich he lped focus the p o l i c y 
dialogue i n the education, health, and social pro tec t ion ~ e c t o r s . ~ The CAS m iss ion i tse l f had l im i t e d 
oppor tun i ty to consult w i t h c i v i l society, although i t did meet w i t h cen tra l government o f f ic ia ls , the donor 
commun i ty , and representatives o f Parliament. These discussions p rov ided a f o r um fo r a i r ing grievances 
on b o t h sides, but did no t result in a recogn i t ion o f fundamental differences that wou ld la ter impede the 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the CAS . The Coun try O f f i c e sought a broader d is tr ibu t ion o f the C A S document once 
i t was made f ina l , but this did no t take place. 

The Government broad ly agreed w i t h the Bank and the donor commun i ty about the need to 
address pover ty i n Gabon. Where i t disagreed was on the mechanics o f h ow t o do t h i s . The Bank’s 
in fo rma l pub l ic expenditure rev iew showed that the main p rob lem was no t a lack o f resources allocated to 
the social sectors, but rather the poor management o f those resources. Too much was spent on “high end” 
services available on ly to the elite, at the expense o f programs in p r ima ry hea l th care and basic education. 
Reor ien t ing social services and social pro tec t ion to increase the ir impac t on pove r ty wou ld requ ire 
fundamental administrative reforms and imp roved governance. M u c h cou ld be achieved w i thou t 
increasing t h e f isca l burden or changing the present pattern of income d is tr ibu t ion . However , the 
Government preferred to pursue an approach based on disengaging the state f r om produc t ive ac t iv i t ies 
and hop ing that the pr iva te sector wou ld generate sufficient, and su f f ic ien t ly remunerative, emp loymen t 
so that the social status quo cou ld be maintained. The links between the correc t ive actions needed in the

consultations.

hea l th and education sectors and the outcomes desired b y Government were no t su f f ic ien t ly explained, 
and are s t i l l no t f u l l y understood by many h igh ly placed decision makers. 

The Government also developed an H I V / A I D S Ac t ion P lan and wou ld have l i k e d Bank support 
i n imp lemen t ing the plan. However, i t was no t prepared to bo r row on IBRD terms fo r that purpose. I t 
felt that the findings o f the Pover ty Assessment ought to jus t i fy concessional lend ing . I f such terms were 
no t available f r om the Bank, i t wou ld go elsewhere, or as a last resort, wou ld finance social programs 
f rom i t s ow n resources. The result, o f course, i s that re la t ive ly l i t t l e has been done to combat H I V / A I D S 
in Gabon, and no attempt has been made to mob i l ize and empower groups outside the M i n i s t r y o f Hea l th 
fo r t h i s purpose. 

The extent to wh ich the goals and objectives o f the C A S were rea l ly shared b y the Bank and the 
Government i s i l lus t ra ted by the extent to wh ich progress has been made during C A S imp lemen ta t ion . 
Where the Bank has been able to p rov ide support, progress has been made, a l though more s low ly than 
o r ig ina l ly planned. Where the Bank has no t been able to p rov ide support, some progress has also been 
made, a l though poss ib ly no t in directions that t h e Bank wou ld have preferred. Other donors have been 
key to ach iev ing t h i s progress. A lso , the comm i tmen t o f many h igh - leve l c i v i l servants to the r e f o rm 
agenda should no t be underestimated. C i v i l society has no t yet been able t o p lay much o f a ro le in 
ho ld ing government t o account, but i t s capacity i s g row ing and i t s voices are increas ing ly being heard. 

Overall assessment. 
In summary, the C A S performance can be rated as “moderately 
unsatisfactory”. The coun try assistance program was relevant to broad na t iona l goals, but was no t w e l l 
aligned w i t h government views about h ow to achieve those goals. The coun try did no t make acceptable 
progress towards a ma jo r i ty o f the proposed CAS outcomes, a l though i t did make s ign i f ican t progress on 
pr iva t iza t ion and some progress on macroeconomic management and capacity building. The C A S 
expectations were probab ly unrealistic under the best o f circumstances, pa r t icu la r ly in t h e area o f pover ty 
a l lev ia t ion . Furthermore, the resources available to the coun try team were far too limited to p rov ide a l l 
the non- lend ing support foreseen in the CAS . 

This raises an issue related to Bank performance wh ich i s no t w i t h i n the direct managerial 
respons ib i l i ty o f the Coun try Team. The CAS presented a v is ion o f wha t cou ld be done in Gabon. 
Indeed, i t was recognized as a “best practice” CAS . I n rev iew ing the dra f t CAS , reg iona l management 
fa i led to po in t out the discrepancy between i t s ambitious objectives and the resources wh ich management 
was prepared to put at the disposal o f the Coun try Team. W h i l e i t i s no t cer ta in that more resources 
wou ld have produced a more satisfactory outcome, i t i s cer ta in that inadequate resources forced the Bank 
to w i thdraw f r om several sectors where i t should have been p rov id ing leadership wh ich slowed the pace 
o f change in many areas. 

E. 

Lessons L e a r n e d f o r Sub s equ en t CAS D e s i g n 

The CAS wou ld have bene f i ted f r om a more f rank and open dialogue between the Bank and the 
Government during i t s preparation. On the Bank side, there should have been a more accurate appraisal 
of the amount o f support that cou ld l i k e l y be delivered, g iven budget constraints. Stakeholder analysis 
m igh t also have revealed the l i k e l y strength o f oppos i t ion t o the re fo rm agenda, and the weak capacity o f 
c i v i l society, especially the re la t ive ly poor, to h o l d the Government accountable in any mean ing fu l way. 
The Bank’s strong comm i tmen t to pursue pover ty a l lev ia t ion may have prevented recogn i t ion o f the 
Government’s views about the re la t ive unimportance o f t h i s p rob lem in comparison to the p rob lem o f 
managing external debt. At the same time, the Government a l lowed the B a n k t o be l ieve that i t agreed 
w i t h the C A S agenda, i n order to mob i l ize “free” TA and grant resources, w h i l e in fac t i t had no in ten t ion 
o f bo r row ing fo r pub l ic sector re fo rm o r pove r ty a l lev ia t ion . 

-66- 

The B a n k was also no t very s tra igh t forward in i t s description o f the pover ty situation i n Gabon. 
In an attempt to he igh ten consciousness o f the p rob lem o f inequ i ty or re la t ive poverty, wh ich indeed may 
present a p o l i t i c a l challenge at some po in t in Gabon’s history, the Bank has tended to overstate the 
p rob lem in comparison to other countries o f Sub-Saharan A f r ica . Wh i le i t i s true that Gabon’s social 
ind ica tors are m u c h lowe r than they ought to be, g iven i t s income level, they are no worse than, and in 
many cases be t ter than, those of most low - income countries. The incidence o f extreme pover ty , 
accord ing to in terna t iona l income-based definitions, i s lowe r than in many countries, ca l l ing f o r a more 
targeted approach t o pover ty alleviation. The solutions i n Gabon may no t be the same as in mos t o f Sub- 
Saharan A f r ica . In fact, the Bank’s approach has large ly focused on imp rov ing the d is t r ibu t ion o f wea l th 
through red i rec t ing pub l ic resources to social services more d i rec t ly targeted to the poor . The Bank has 
done re la t ive ly l i t t l e to address the need fo r economic d ivers i f ica t ion and employment generation to 
increase the p roduc t iv i ty of the poor. Furthermore, the Bank has pa id surpr is ing ly l i t t l e attention to 
HIV/AIDS in Gabon, wh ich i s a genuine concern o f the coun try and wh ich has reached prevalence levels 
(above 7%) that ough t also to be o f concern to the Bank . 

The C A S did no t address d irec t ly Government concerns about “social peace,” wh ich l i e at the 
heart o f the ren t red is tr ibu t ion system. The delicate balance o f power among social groups wh ich has 
been built through this system i s a s ign i f ican t source o f resistance to change and the problems wh ich have 
been experienced in imp lemen t ing and sustaining reforms. This balance w i l l o f course g row more 
d i f f i c u l t to ma in ta in as Government’s discretionary revenues decrease over time. Furthermore, there i s a 
rea l risk that imp roved economic performance w i l l result in rising expectations and increasing demand fo r 
services f r om c i v i l society. The challenge to the Government i s to manage t h i s trans i t ion so that human 
needs are more e f fec t ive ly and e f f ic ien t ly me t wh i le social peace i s maintained. De f in ing the challenge in 
this way might better capture the area o f shared concern between the Bank and the Government. 

I t i s possible that in the end results wou ld no t have imp roved b y a more realistic C A S and may 
have s imp ly fur ther reduced the resources available to the coun try team. Resources that were even tua l ly 
redirected towards po l icy dialogue and technical support on issues that were impor tan t bo th to the Bank 
and t o the Government. B y ar t icu la t ing the agenda f o r pover ty alleviation, in consultation w i t h the donor 
commun i ty , the CAS , however, established a w o r k program that was pursued by the Government and 
other donors at a more realistic pace, dr iven b y the hope o f debt rescheduling and IMF balance o f 
payments support. This wo rk has l a i d a founda t ion fo r con t inu ing dialogue and may even tua l ly resu l t in 
agreement on sound sector strategies and a med ium te rm expenditure framework. The Bank may then be 
able to p lay a ro le in mob i l iz ing resources fo r pover ty a l lev ia t ion , by convening donor roundtables or b y 
d irec t lending. 

Sustainability. Achievements in macroeconomic management are m i x e d but l i k e l y t o be 
sustainable, w i t h occasional interruptions, at least as l o n g as Gabon requires the support o f the IMF. The 
coun try has made progress in debt reduc t ion and has near ly e l im ina ted the f isca l burden o f parastatal 
enterprises. I t w i l l rema in dependent on o i l revenues in the short t o med ium term. Shou ld o i l revenues 
f a l l drama t ica l ly (wh ich does no t seem immed ia te ly l i k e l y in v iew o f the p reva i l ing high o i l prices), the 
Government cou ld become e l ig ib le fo r b lend o r even IDA bo r row ing . However , the sustainability o f 
present levels o f pub l ic expenditure w i l l depend in the l o n g run on successful development o f the pr iva te 
sector. 

The achievements o f the CAS in the area o f pr iva te sector development should be sustainable, as 
in most cases they are irreversible. The un f in ished p r iva t iza t ion agenda i s l i k e l y to be f in ished in the no t 
very distant future. However , regu la tory and ins t i tu t iona l capacity remains very weak, and substantial 
add i t iona l support w i l l be needed to in terna l ize these changes. Imp roved transparency in procurement 
and the ru le o f law w i l l be necessary to sustain g row th in the p r iva te sector. M o r e attention needs to be 
pa id to the supply side in addressing the c r i t ica l p rob lem o f you th unemployment. 

-67- 

On strengthening pub l ic sector e f f ic iency and effectiveness, par t icu lar ly in sectors c r i t ica l fo r 
pover ty a l lev ia t ion , the C A S outcomes are m ixed and in general disappointing. So far, the Government’s 
approach to pove r ty a l lev ia t ion has been to seek add i t iona l investment more than t o imp rove the 
management o f ex is t ing resources. 
I t has been noted that rea l pub l ic sector re fo rm wou ld requ ire 
“no th ing less than a cu l ture change on the part o f Gabon’s pub l ic sector.”” The Bank has no t ye t learned 
how to induce such a cu l ture change in the absence o f strong economic or po l i t ica l imperatives. 

One p rog ram that seems to have been successful i n promo t ing cu l ture change i s that undertaken 
under the U rban LIL. Though l im i ted in scale, t h i s program has succeeded in imp rov ing l i v i n g conditions 
in underserved urban neighborhoods w i t h broad commun i ty par t ic ipa t ion and the co l labora t ion o f loca l 
authorities. 
I t also helped to build capacity among small contractors and temporar i ly a l lev ia ted the 
pressing p rob lem o f unemployment. However, the small-scale works undertaken b y the pro jec t do no t 
fully meet the aspirations o f the people, especially loca l po l i t ic ians . Whether this approach can be 
successfully “scaled up” remains to be seen. 

The agenda on building the capacity o f c i v i l society was almost en t ire ly placed in the hands o f 
other donors o r ins t i tu t ions . I t was no t strongly supported b y Government, and so i t did no t become a 
p r i o r i t y fo r the donor commun i ty . Consequently, l i t t l e was accomplished in t h i s area. S t i l l , there i s an 
emerging c i v i l society i n Gabon, wh ich wants and needs to become a true partner in development. In 
particular, i t w i l l be necessary to invo lve c i v i l society (as w e l l as Parliament, and the pr iva te sector) more 
f u l l y in the preparation o f the fo r thcom ing PRSP, as their comm i tmen t and par t ic ipa t ion w i l l be needed in 
i t s imp lemen ta t ion and mon i tor ing . The Bank has recently taken steps to assist the Government in 
developing a par t ic ipa tory process fo r the PRSP. This in i t ia t ive needs to be supported and sustained b y 
the Bank as w e l l as the rest o f the donor commun i ty . 

Institutional capacity. There were, indeed, ma jor issues concerning coun try ins t i tu t iona l 
capacity, that emerged bo th in the attempts to imp lemen t agreed po l icy re forms and in ‘the imp lemen ta t ion 
o f ongo ing projects. The CAS agenda focused large ly on creating the lega l and ins t i tu t iona l frameworks 
for change. Where such efforts have been successful, capacity constraints have become evident, and i t i s 
clear that fu ture programs shou ld focus even more strongly on capacity bu i ld ing in government, in sma l l 
and med ium size enterprises, and in c i v i l society. Capacity building means more than t ra in ing and 
equipment, although these may w e l l be necessary. B o t h a t t i tud ina l and behav iora l change w i l l be needed, 
and these w i l l have to “ t r ick le down,” at least in government institutions, f r om the top. 
Imp roved 
communications and a freer f l o w o f in fo rma t ion w i l l be essential to success. On a more mundane level, 
to the extent that Bank projects ( inc lud ing grants) are imp lemen ted b y peop le un fam i l ia r w i t h Bank 
procedures, i t w i l l be necessary to ensure that appropriate tra in ing i s p rov ided and strong support i s g iven 
to the teams responsible fo r pro jec t implementation. Annua l Pub l ic Expend i ture Rev iews wou ld be 
he lp fu l in ensuring that adequate counterpart funds are budgeted and available when needed. 

The consultation process fo r the 1998 CAS created expectations wh ich neither the Government 
no r the Bank was prepared to fulfill. Par t ic ipa t ion by c i v i l society was s t i l l a new idea, and there was 
l i t t l e analysis by the Bank o f the stakes o r the stakeholders. Consu l ta t ion took place around a v is ion fo r 
the future, perhaps no t fully grounded in the rea l i t ies o f the past. Consu l ta t ion was also la rge ly l im i t e d to 
selected agendas such as the transport sector strategy or the pover ty a l lev ia t ion program. The overa l l 
design o f the CAS and the relationships o f i t s d i f fe ren t parts were no t apparent t o a w ide audience. T o 
imp rove on t h i s , i t w i l l be necessary to s t a r t consu l ta t ion much sooner (as has been done) and to base i t on 
a shared assessment o f past programs and results. M a n y misunderstandings may need to be expressed 
and explained. M o r e extensive and sustained commun ica t ion w i t h the pub l ic w i l l be needed, inc lud ing

Summary. 
The performance o f 
the 1998 CAS has been 
rated 
“moderately 
unsatisfactory”. This result i s due to deficiencies on the par t o f bo th the Bank and t h e Government. In 
the first place, the C A S did no t represent a realistic assessment o f what the Government was prepared t o 
do or wha t the B a n k was prepared to support over the nex t three years. This can pa r t ly be exp la ined by 
s h i f t s in h igh - leve l management in bo th the Bank and Government that intervened shortly a f ter the C A S 
was completed. However , Bank management bears the respons ib i l i ty fo r approving and sending fo rwa rd 
a CAS wh ich i t was no t prepared to support w i t h adequate resources. The lesson fo r the fu ture may b e 
that a C A S shou ld be costed, at least in terna l ly , and compared to foreseeable budget allocations. A 
co ro l la ry i s that when the Bank i s ca l led upon to p lay the ro le o f a “Knowledge Bank,” country budge t ing 
should no t be based solely on the size o f the lending program. 

A second factor a f fec t ing C A S performance was the extended hiatus in Bank presence in the 
f ie ld . A f t e r setting up a Coun try O f f ice w i t h a Resident Representative, the Bank (and the Government) 
sent m i x e d signals wh ich undermined his effectiveness. A f te r his re turn to Washington, more than a year 
passed before a suitable replacement cou ld be found. Meanwh i le , there was l i t t l e con t inu i ty in the 
Coun try Econom is t position, although the dialogue seems to have been ma in ta ined at a fa i r ly consistent 
leve l . There has been rather more con t inu i ty in the Coun try Team as a whole, and supervision o f ongo ing 
projects has, b y and large, been effective. Close co l labora t ion between the Bank and the IMF, w i t h a 
g row ing emphasis on governance, has been a factor in the re la t ive success o f the macroeconomic 
management component. In contrast, the inab i l i ty o f the Bank to de l iver much support in areas related to 
pover ty reduc t ion probab ly has much t o do w i t h the slow pace o f progress in t h i s area. The lack o f an 
e f fec t ive Bank presence in the f i e l d also constrained co l labora t ion w i t h other donors du r ing t h i s period. 

Finally, the C A S agenda was congruent w i t h Government objectives when seen in the l o n g run. 
Some progress has been made, but no t at the pace that was expected. M o r e stakeholder analysis, and a 
more restricted re fo rm agenda fo r each operation, m igh t have imp roved the chances fo r success. Fo r the 
fu ture CAS, i t w i l l be necessary to set even sharper pr ior i t ies and to concentrate Bank resources on areas 
o f rea l comparative advantage. Con t inued co l labora t ion w i t h other donors, and broadened consultation 
and commun ica t ion w i t h c i v i l society, w i l l be essential. These are l i k e l y to develop fur ther through the 
process o f PRSP preparation.

L i m i t s , i f any, to the 
ove ra l l amount of 
recurrent expenditures that 
the Bank may finance 

ExplanatiodRemarks 
The actual Bank f inanc ing share wou ld be 
determined dur ing the preparation o f each new 
project and are l i k e l y to be about 90% o f the 
project cost in most cases. F inanc ing up t o 
100% w i l l be applied on a selective case b y 
case and me r id jus t i f ica t ion basis, pa r t icu la r ly 
for ac t iv i t ies supported by IDF grants. 
In ind iv idua l projects, the Bank wou ld take i n t o 
account sustainability issues at the pro jec t and 
sector level, inc lud ing : (i) the sustainability o f 
project achievements and Bank- f inanced 
recurrent costs; and (ii) the im p l i e d fu ture 
budgetary outlays. The leve l o f Bank f inanc ing 
o f recurrent costs i s expected t o be a re la t ive ly 
l o w share o f to ta l p ro jec t costs, and i s mainly 
expected to be fo r salaries and operating costs 
associated w i t h pro jec t imp lemen ta t ion . 
The requirements fo r loca l cost f inanc ing are

that: (i) f inanc ing 
requirements fo r the 
country’s development 
program wou ld exceed the 
pub l ic sector’s own 
resources (e.g., f r om 
taxation and other 
revenues) and expected 
domestic borrow ing ; and 
(ii) the f inanc ing o f fore ign

There are no unreasonable taxes and duties. 
The Bank may finance a l l taxes and duties

pro jec t- leve l , the Bank wou ld consider whether 
taxes and duties constitute an excessively high
