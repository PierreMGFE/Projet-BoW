FY06-09 C O U N T R Y ASSISTANCE STRATEGY FOR THE K INGDOM OF BHUTAN 

EXECUTIVE S ~ R ~ R ~ A R Y 

1. 
Bhutan, landlocked and with a difficult terrain and widely dispersed population, has made 
rapid socioeconomic progress. As a result o f prudent macroeconomic management, exploitation o f 
hydropower resources, and substantial support from donors, t h e country has had a good economic 
performance, with GDP growth averaging over 6 percent a year, and close to 8 percent over the past 
5 years. Government investment in soc ia l and human development has resulted in measurable 
improvements in the well-being o f the Bhutanese people, and good progress towards meeting several 
o f the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). 

2. 
Development Vision and Poverty Reduction Strategy. As the las t remaining Himalayan 
Buddhist kingdom, Bhutan i s concerned with preserving i t s culture, environment, and identity. 
While economic growth i s considered important, creating an environment where every individual 
can seek and achieve happiness has been chosen as a major goal. Accordingly, the Royal 
Government o f Bhutan (RGoB) i s pursuing a holistic path o f change framed by a unique and 
homegrown development vision: Gross National Happiness (GNH), which i s underpinned by four 
pillars that further define the e f f o r t t o balance spiritual and material advancement-sustainable 
socioeconomic development, conservation and sustainable use o f the environment, promotion o f 
culture, and good governance. 

3 . 

A l l policy and planning documents, projects, programs, and legislation strive to make the 
concept o f GNH operational. The country’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), underpinned 
by the Ninth Five Year Development Plan (9FYP), r e f l e c t s this vision through concrete objectives 
and strategies, including improving quality o f l i f e and income especially for the poor; promoting 
private sector growth and employment; strengthening governance, particularly at the decentralized 
level; and promoting culture and environmental conservation. 

4. 
Development Challenges. Finding a place in a globalized world i s a major challenge for a 
small state such as Bhutan, which only started opening to the world recently. The country’s small 
and dispersed population and formidable climate and topography make i t difficult to achieve 
economies o f scale in service delivery, and costly to build and maintain vital infrastructure. 
Employment generation, particularly fo r youth, i s an emerging concern. 
Importantly, there are 
implicit tradeoffs in the country’s development vision that require close attention given their 
implications for economic growth and employment. 

5 . 

I n the medium term, the timing and net impact o f Tala Hydropower Project (1020 
megawatts-xpected 
to come on stream in 2006-will be critical for economic growth and the 
development e f f o r t s o f RGoB. Overall, hydropower development has been beneficial, even while 
increasing Bhutan’s re l iance on a single commodity exported to a single market and strengthening 
the role o f the public sector i n the economy. The private sector, which faces major constraints, 
remains small and underdeveloped and cannot yet provide sufficient and attractive job opportunities. 
As such, when hydropower i s set aside, a different picture o f t h e country emerges, with a majority o f 
the population largely dependent on subsistence-level agricultural activities and some areas o f the 
country sdll outside o f the modern economy. I n this context, access to soc ia l services and markets i s 
critical to ensure the equitable and balanced growth aspired to by the country.

Execu t ive Summary 

6. 

Lessons f r o m t h e P r e v i o u s CAS. As learned f r om OED ’s Coun t ry Assistance Eva lua t ion 
and the C A S Comp le t ion Report, to max im ize development impact, Bank assistance needs to 
emphasize selectivity, w h i c h shou ld be balanced with f l e x i b i l i t y in order t o best respond to new 
client needs and changing coun t ry and g loba l conditions. As a corollary, the lend ing program should 
also be better in fo rmed regard ing l o c a l conditions. O n the other hand, supp ly-dr iven assistance 
should be avoided, pa r t icu la r ly in regard t o non-lending services. S trong donor coordination i s 
required in order t o enhance development effectiveness. In addition, i t i s impo r tan t that the Bank be 
more sensitive t o Bhutan’s capac i ty constraints. 

7. 

World B a n k Group S t ra tegy . The FY06-09 C A S i s se lec t ive ly aligned w i t h Bhutan’s 
v is ion and the p r io r i t ies and goals o f the 9FYPPRSP . Accord ing ly , during the C A S period, the 
Bank Group w i l l he lp Bhu tan (i) expand access to better infrastructure and qua l i ty o f social services, 
and connect commun i t ies to markets; (ii) promote pr iva te sector development and employment; and 
(iii) strengthen management o f pub l ic resources, and m o n i t o r i n g and eva lua t ion o f development 
outcomes. The Bank G roup w i l l also p rov ide support t o the R o y a l Government’s crosscutting e f for ts 
t o promote decentralization, good governance, and env ironmen ta l management. 
CAS 
implementation w i l l emphasize partnerships w i t h donors and the p r om o t i o n o f the harmonization 
agenda, w h i l e b u i l d i n g capacity to fac i l i ta te increased reliance o n coun t ry systems. A mon i to r ing 
and evaluation (M&E) framework i s ou t l ined i n the CAS result ma tr ix , w h i c h w i l l be the basis f o r 
assessing progress o f C A S imp lemen ta t ion as w e l l as achievement o f CAS outcomes and Bank 
con tr ibu t ion t o these outcomes. 

8 . 

Bhu tan i s a full IDA grant coun try in FY06 , w i t h an a l loca t ion o f US$14 .5 m i l l i o n . Fo r the 
first time, the Bank w i l l p rov ide budget support to Bhu tan through the proposed Deve lopmen t Po l icy 
Grant in FY06 , w h i c h w i l l he lp advance RGoB ’s reforms in macroeconomic, fiscal, and pub l ic 
f inanc ia l management; p r iva te sector development; and education and health. This grant i s expected 
to be the first one in a series o f programma t ic policy-based operations. In addition, through ongo ing 
and new investment lending, the B a n k Group w i l l con t inue t o support sectors such as education, 
urban development, r u r a l development, pr iva te sector development, r u r a l roads, and H I V / A I D S 
prevention. H is to r ica l ly , ID A f inanc ia l assistance has been lumpy and irregu lar . G o i n g forward, t h e 
Bank has agreed to he lp f inance at least one project per f isca l year. I F C w i l l support investments i n 
tourism and other sectors c r i t i c a l f o r g r ow t h and employment, and th rough the South As ia Enterprise 
Development F a c i l i t y (SEDF) w i l l he lp promote the development o f sma l l and medium en te rp r ises . 
The program o f ana ly t ica l and adv isory ac t iv i t ies (AAA) w i l l a im t o be responsive t o the country’s 
needs and capacity constraints, w h i l e striving to rema in focused. As such, the C A S includes a 
f lex ib le AAA program characterized by a limited number o f f o rm a l ac t iv i t ies , programma t ic non- 
lend ing technical assistance i n selected areas, and just-in-time AAA to respond to emerging c l ien t 
demand. 

9 . 
M a n a g i n g Risks. It i s expected that revenues f r om hyd ropowe r w i l l con t inue t o benefit the 
country and that macroeconomic management w i l l remain sound. P o l i t i c a l changes are underway, 
inc lud ing a new Cons t i tu t ion and the in troduc t ion o f p o l i t i c a l parties and na t iona l elections. 
However, the process be ing f o l l ow e d i s highly participatory, and i s be ing paced so as t o a l l ow fo r the 
development o f na t iona l capacity t o imp lemen t the electoral process and to g ive peop le time to adjust

COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY 

FOR THE K INGDOM OF BHUTAN 

1 , 
The last Coun try Assistance Strategy (CAS) fo r Bhu tan was discussed by the W o r l d Bank’s 
Board o f D irec tors in December 1999. The new CAS, cover ing t h e pe r iod FY06-09 , was prepared 
f o l l ow i n g the comp le t ion o f the country’s Poverty Reduc t ion Strategy Paper (PRSP), wh ich was 
based on the Ninth F ive -Yea r P lan (9FYP). On February 8, 2005, the B o a r d d iscussed the PRSP and 
the Joint S ta f f A d v i s o r y N o t e (JSAN),’ and this document also reflects the guidance prov ided by the 
Board on that occasion. Bhu tan became a member o f I F C in December 2003, and this i s the first 
CAS j o i n t l y prepared by IDA and IFC . 

2 . 
The 9FYP lPRSP i s framed by Bhutan’s unique development v is ion o f increasing Gross 
Na t iona l Happiness, and reflects the commendable e f for ts o f the R o y a l Governmen t o f Bhu tan 
(RGoB) t o improve the we l l -be ing o f the Bhutanese despite the challenges imposed by the country’s 
mountainous geography and location. In l i n e w i t h the objectives se t in the 9FYP/PRSP, the CAS 
w i l l focus o n helping Bhu tan : (i) expand access to better in fras truc ture and social services, and 
connect communities t o markets; (ii) promote private sector development and employment; and (iii) 
strengthen management o f pub l ic resources and mon i to r ing and eva lua t ion o f development 
outcomes. To fac i l i ta te the achievement o f these ,strategic objectives, the B a n k Group w i l l also 
provide support t o the R o y a l Government’s crosscutting e f for ts t o p romo te decentralization, good 
governance, and env ironmen ta l management. Moreover, C A S imp lemen ta t ion w i l l emphasize 
partnerships w i t h donors active in Bhutan, wh i le p romo t ing the harmon iza t ion agenda and capacity 
bu i ld ing to increase re l iance o n na t iona l systems. 

3 . 
The CAS pe r iod bridges the ninth and tenth five-year plans. Nevertheless, the timing o f the 
CAS Progress Repor t i n F Y 0 7 w i l l co inc ide w i t h the comp le t ion o f the 9FYP/PRSP, which w i l l 
provide an oppor tun i ty t o adjust, as necessary, the Bank Group’s assistance strategy and program t o 
possible changes in p r io r i t ies and coun try conditions. 

I. COUNTRY OVERVIEW 

4 . 

Bhu tan i s a sma l l k ingdom cover ing 38,394 square k i lome ters in the eastern Himalayas.2 
Nestled between Ch ina and India, Bhu tan started opening t o the w o r l d re la t ive ly recently, especially 
through tourism. During this process, the country has experienced rapid soc ia l and economic 
development as a r e s u l t o f prudent macroeconomic management, bene f ic ia l exp lo i ta t ion o f 
hydropower resources, and substantial support f r om development partners. 
The country’s 
population, o f f i c i a l l y estimated at 752,700, i s mos t ly young, rural, and w i d e l y scattered across 
Bhutan’s rugged terrain.3 Over 42 percent o f Bhutanese are b e l ow 1 5 years o f age and 79 percent 
l ive i n the countryside. Nevertheless, urbanization has accelerated, and Thimphu, the K ingdom ’s 
capital, i s g row ing fast at around 10 percent per year. Agr icu l ture , t h e ma ins tay o f subsistence and 
employment, relies o n scattered and scarce arable land tha t amounts to less than 8 percent o f the 
country’s 
terr i tory . N o t surprisingly, 
land ho ld ings are sma l l and fragmented, and fa rm

Estimates o f the total land area vary depending on the source. T h e World Development indicators and other international

sources provide somewhat higher estimates than the official figure given above. 
for example, Bhutan’s population i s about 900,000, The first National Population and Housing Census was conducted in 
May 2005 and more reliable data should be available soon.

mechanization qu i te l im i ted . D ispers ion o f the popu la t ion and the form idab le topography, w i t h 
elevations rang ing f r om 100 to 7,500 meters, make i t difficult to achieve economies o f scale in 
service de l ive ry and costly t o b u i l d and ma in ta in roads and other v i t a l infrastructure. This i s made 
even more cha l leng ing b y monsoon f loods and landslides in summer and i c y cond i t ions in winter. 

5 . 

The same topography, however, prov ides Bhu tan w i t h enormous hydropower po ten t ia l - 
curren t ly estimated at 30,000 megawatts - in add i t ion t o substantial forest resources and b iod ivers i ty . 
The country has started to exp lo i t hydropower resources in a bene f ic ia l manner, m a i n l y w i t h support 
f r om I n d i a - i t s largest single donor and trad ing partner. Indeed, d r iven by hydropower development 
and strong donor support, Bhu tan has enjoyed strong economic performance, with GDP g row th 
averaging over 6 percent a year over the past two decades. Sustained g row th has increased Gross 
Na t iona l Income (GN I ) per capita to US$770 (2004). W h i l e investments in the hydropower sector 
have helped accelerate economic g row th and social and human development, the country’s reliance 
on a single commod i ty exported t o a single marke t has increased. At the same time, e lec tr ic i ty 
expor t revenues have strengthened the ro le o f the pub l ic sector in the economy. In contrast, the 
pr iva te sector has remained small, and a substantial po r t ion o f the popu la t ion i s s t i l l engaged in 
subsistence agriculture. 

6 . 

D u r i n g the CAS period, the timing and net impac t o f the Ta la Hyd ropowe r Pro jec t (1020 
megawa t ts ) -expec ted to come o n stream in 2006-will 
be c r i t i c a l f o r ma in ta in ing growth, 
sustaining RG o B e f for ts to expand access to better infrastructure and services, mee t ing increasing 
recurrent costs, and ensuring sound f isca l and debt management. Moreover , fos ter ing pr iva te sector 
development w i l l be impor tan t f o r boos t ing economic ac t iv i ty and generating employment 
opportunities. Add i t iona l factors t o take in to account inc lude the ex ten t t o w h i c h the country w i l l 
manage to tap i n t o the po ten t ia l o f fered b y tou r ism and value-added ac t iv i t ies in agriculture, as well 
as the evo lu t ion o f decentralization and possible decline o f donor assistance. S ign i f ican t po l i t ica l 
changes w i l l take place in the nex t f ew years, inc lud ing the move to a cons t i tu t iona l monarchy when 
a new cons t i tu t ion i s adopted and the f i r s t na t iona l elections. A l t h o u g h the security s i tua t ion a long 
the southern border i s stable, the external threat o f separatist groups f r om I n d i a w i l l rema in a 
concern.

DEVELOPMENT VISION AND POVERTY REDUCT ION STRATEGY 

7. 
Bhutan’s development has been guided by a homegrown ph i losophy based o n the concept o f 
Gross Na t iona l H a p p i n e s ~ . ~ This concept recognizes that development invo lves mo re than economic 
progress, and establishes happiness as a leg i t ima te p o l i c y concern and max im iza t ion o f happiness as 
an overarching goal. Accord ing ly , Bhu tan has f o l l ow e d a un ique development process that s t r ives to 
balance sp ir i tua l and ma ter ia l advancement through fou r p i l lars : sustainable and equitable economic 
g row th and development, preservation and sustainable use o f t h e environment, preservation and 
p romo t ion o f cu l tu ra l heritage, and good governance. This v is ion and framework has been translated 
i n t o sectoral policies, strategies and programs imp lemen ted through Bhutan’s f ive-year development 
plans, inc lud ing the ongo ing 9FYP (FY03-07) that constitutes the basis f o r the country’s f i r s t 
Pover ty Reduc t ion Strategy Paper (PRSP). 

8 . 
Bhutan’s PRSP aims t o galvanize the pover ty reduc t ion and development e f for ts o f the 
R o y a l Government.’ Building o n past achievements, the PRSP se ts amb i t ious targets with the 
expectation that Bhu tan should do even better than i t has so far. Spec i f ica l ly , the PRSP reflects the 

The country’s development vision and long-term goals are clearly described in Bhutan 2020: A V is ion fo r Peace. 

Prosperity and Happiness, RGoB, 1999.

country’s development v is ion and goals, as w e l l as the Millennium Deve lopmen t Goals (MDGs) 
through the overa l l objectives o f the 9FYP: (a) imp rov ing the qua l i ty o f l i f e and income, especially 
o f the poor; (b) ensuring good governance; (c) promo t ing p r iva te sector g row th and employment

*:+ Ma inta in ing sound macroeconomic policy. The 9FYPPRSP assumes an annual grow th 
target o f 7 t o 9 percent. To achieve and sustain this g row th rate, RGoB aims to limit the 
current budget de f ic i t t o 4-5 percent o f GDP and i n f l a t i o n t o around 7-8 percent per annum, 
w h i l e pursu ing an adequate leve l o f reserves and a sustainable path o f p u b l i c debt. Private 
sector development i s recognized as an important fac tor f o r fu ture g r ow t h and especially 
employment generation. 
Ensuring good governance. This strategy i s t o be advanced through fur ther implementation 
o f p o l i t i c a l and adm in is tra t ive reforms, including, inter alia, the adop t ion o f the national 
cons t i tu t ion and increased decentralization. The Dzongkhag (d is tr ic t) and Geog (block)6 
elected counc i ls are t o have the autonomy to make plans, allocate resources mob i l ized f rom 
their loca l tax revenues, and frame ru les and regulations applicable within their respective 
jur isd ic t ions . To enable f inanc ia l decentralization, the 9FYPPRSP allocates separate 
budgets f o r ac t iv i t ies which w i l l be d i rec t ly formulated, approved, and executed at the 
dzongkhag and geog levels. G iven the expected changes at various government levels, the 
9FYPPRSP also recognizes the need t o strengthen the agencies responsible f o r ensuring 
transparency and accoun tab i l i ty .

There a re tradeoffs implicit in the country’s development vision that should be c lose ly 
analyzed as part o f the efforts to balance cultural and environmental preservation goals with 
acceleration o f economic development and improvement o f the well-being o f a l l Bhutanese. The 
country, fo r instance, has not fully tapped into the tourism sector’s potential. This sector could be 
strategically expanded while still maintaining the cultural and environmental values intrinsic t o the 
country’s vision. At the same time, the considerable opportunities offered by the forestry sector to 
develop the timber industry may need to be weighed against existing restrictions on export and 
manufacturing. 

A. 

Poverty Reduction and Human Development 

11. 
The 9FYPRRSP notes that poverty, which manifests i t s e l f in many dimensions, i s s t i l l 
widespread i n rural areas, and se ts improving quality o f l i f e and income, especially o f the poor, as an 
explicit long-term objective. Continued government investment in social and human development 
has resulted in measurable improvements in the well-being o f the Bhutanese. However, it i s often 
difficult to measure long-term trends and t o establish reliable estimates o f key indicators due to lack 
o f data, as well as inconsistent definitions and methodologies across some o f t h e household surveys 
that have been conducted thus far. 
Importantly, despite various initiatives to strengthen poverty 
monitoring and evaluation (M&E), survey efforts have been ad hoc and coordination between 
agencies remains weak. As noted by the JSAN, statistical systems need to be strengthened, and the 
existing data used more effectively to underpin poverty reduction efforts. Respectively, the 
challenge posited in the 9FYPRRSP i s to develop a comprehensive definition o f poverty that 
embraces Bhutan’s development philosophy, values, and unique conditions, while improving 
monitoring and evaluation o f development outcomes. An important step in this respect i s the first 
National Population and Housing Census, conducted on May 30 and 3 1,2005. 

12. 
According t o the Bhutan Living Standard Survey (BLSS)-the 
first o f its kind in the 
country-3 1.7 percent o f the population was poor in 2003.8 Moreover, about 11 percent o f the 
population would suffer from hunger for two or three months per year. Using the BLSS and 
nutrition conversion factors, i t i s estimated that about 48.3 percent o f the population, mainly living in 
rural areas, were unable to meet their ca lor ic  requirement^.^ In terms o f nutrition, iron deficiency 
appears to be a problem in Bhutan, often resulting in anemia, while the consumption o f fruits and 
vegetables also seems inadequate relative to internationally accepted requirements. 

13. 

Both poverty and hunger are mostly a rural phenomenon. According to the BLSS, in 2003 
the incidence o f poverty was 9 times higher in rural areas than in urban settings (38.3 percent 
compared with 4.2 percent). Reflecting the findings o f the Poverty Assessment a n d Analysis Study 
(2000), the 9FYPPRSP identifies the main corre la tes o f poverty as lack o f road access, inadequate 
s ize o f farmland, food insecurity, lack o f off-farm employment, and limited access t o modern 
technology. Not surprisingly, the 2003 B L S S shows that poverty tends to be high in remote areas, 
where difficult terra in and climatic conditions constrain productivity as well as access to roads,

T h e survey, conducted w i th support from ADB, i s nationally representative, as we l l as for urban and rural areas. Sampling 
however was designed in the absence o f a census. T h e poverty line was constructed using both food and non-food 
components on t h e basis o f consumption needed to meet basic needs. Accordingly, the poverty l ine was assumed at Nu. 
740.35 per person per month (about US$0.53 per day). In addition, deep poverty (estimated at 3 .8 percent o f the 
population i n 2003) i s defined as a total per capita expenditure lower than the food poverty line, which means that the 
household cannot afford to buy the assumed minimum 2,124 Kcal per person per day. Based on the BLSS, the Royal 
Government prepared in 2004 a report titled Poverty Analysis Report. 
T h i s analysis i s subject to a number o f caveats as the BLSS was not designed for nutrition analysis (see draft Bhutan 
Hum an Development Repo r t , 2005).

markets, and basic services. 
In addition, education has also been found to be an important 
determinant o f poverty in the country. 

14. 
Inequality appears comparatively high in Bhutan, but as i s the case with poverty - which i s 
likely to have decreased over the last two decades - lack o f data makes i t difficult to gauge long-term 
trends." Based on the BLSS, the estimated Gini coefficient in 2003 was 0.42 (with 1 representing 
perfect inequality)." This trend largely reflects the gap between incomes in urban and rural areas. 
There i s a concern, however, that despite concerted government efforts, the poor may not be 
benefiting as much from growth as the non-poor. The poor appear to be l e s s mobile, and hence l e s s 
likely t o go to those places where remunerative jobs are generated and public s e r v i c e s are made 
available. The poor also have more limited access t o credit. In the absence o f formal safety nets, 
inter-household redistribution i s mostly occurring through remittances, often from urban to rural 
areas. 

15. 
Data constraints also make i t difficult to assess Bhutan's social and human development 
progress fully, but available figures indicate that in 2003 l i f e expectancy at birth was 66 years, up 
from 60 years in 1991, and that population growth has decelerated t o around 2 .5 percent from about 
3 .1 percent i n 1991. Bhutan has also made significant progress in improving education and health 
outcomes. In 1991, official figures showed the gross enrollment rate (GER) in primary education at 
5 5 percent. I n 2003, according to the BLSS, the GER has increased to over 92 percent. I n part due 
to the consistent implementation o f the immunization policy, infant and under-five mortality ratios 
have been halved s ince 1984, and were estimated in 2000 at 60.5 and 84.0 deaths per 1000 live 
births, respectively.'* The incidence o f stunting and underweight has dropped considerably from 
1988 to 1999; stunting among children under five declined from 56.1 percent to 40.0 percent, and 
underweight from 3 8 percent to 18.7 percent.I3 Over the 1980s and 1990s, access to health services 
increased dramatically, with at leas t 89 percent o f the population at present residing within a three- 
hour walking distance from the nearest health center. Given health concerns, in December 2004 
Bhutan became the first country in the world to ban the sale o f tobacco. Increased access to safe 
water and sanitation has paralleled trends in health indicators. BLSS data show that currently about 
81.1 percent o f the population has access to safe drinking water and 93 .5 percent has access to 
latrines or toilets. Overall progress notwithstanding, some indicators, such as maternal mortality, 
remain at levels comparable to very poor countries, in large part reflecting the tough terra in and 
related difficulty in providing access to basic services. Given these conditions, the extensive reach 
o f such initiatives as child immunization programs i s remarkable. 

16. 

Bhutan has also made progress in terms o f gender equality, and in general, women enjoy 
equal opportunities, entitlements and legal status. However, there are gaps in areas such as higher- 
level education and enterprise development. Specific details on progress in achieving the MDGs are 
provided in Attachment 1 (see summary in Table 1 below). 

l o The 2000 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) i s not comparable to the 2003 BLSS. The HIES was a p i lo t 
effort, based on a provisional and different poverty l ine than the one used i n t h e 2003 BLSS , and did not take seasonality 
into account. 
I ' Although not directly comparable, G in i coefficient estimates based on the 2000 HIES were lower at 0.36.

The timing and net impac t o f Ta la i s c r i t i c a l to Bhutan’s medium-term prospects. Currently, 
total e lec tr ic i ty generating capac i ty amounts t o 437 megawatts. Ta la w i l l bring an add i t iona l 1020 
megawatts, expand ing e lec t r ic i ty produc t ion by around 230 percent. Moreover , as men t ioned above, 
when Ta la comes on stream, g r ow t h w i l l accelerate sharply. 
In comparison, when the Chukha 
hydropower p lan t was activated du r ing 1986 and 1987, GDP j um p e d in those years by 12 and 25 
percent respectively. I n the case o f Tala, although the pos i t ive econom ic impu lse w i l l be pa r t ia l ly 
offset by an associated fa l l in cons truc t ion w i t h the comp le t ion o f the project, GDP may r i s e b y over 
18 percent and the share o f to ta l government revenues accounted f o r by the hydropower sector w i l l 
j um p f r om 30 to 50 percent. On the other hand, the increase in available resources fo r government 
spending due t o Ta la i t s e l f w i l l be limited by the fact that large repayments o n other hydropower 
loans w i l l s t a r t at the same time, and the poss ib i l i ty o f l e s s budge t support program f r om the 
Government of I n d i a (Go]). In addition, the revenues f r om Ta la w i l l depend o n the f i n a l power tariff 
curren t ly under nego t ia t ion w i t h Ind ia . This, combined with t h e g r ow i n g recurrent costs associated 
w i t h ongo ing investments in health, education, and infrastructure in general, mean that n o significant 
f isca l surpluses are expected over t h e med ium term. 

20. 

The hydropower sector w i l l continue to be the ma jor d r ive r o f grow th , as it has been f o r over 
the past e o decades. Bhu tan has o n l y started to tap in to i t s hyd ropowe r potential, and in l i n e w i t h i t s 
development vision, plans t o con t inue inves t ing in t h i s sector. In this respect, two new ma jor projects 
have already been iden t i f ied : Punatshangchu (Stage 11,992 MW) and Mangdechu (670 MW). I n d i a

has agreed to f inance the preparation o f detailed project reports, but these w i l l t a k e about two years 
to complete, while further analysis i s needed to understand more clearly the implications o f these 
types o f mega-projects for the country’s overall macroeconomic framework.I6 However, as i n the 
past, these new projects would boost the construction sector and help ra ise growth. (For further 
details on the power sector see Attachment 2). Notwithstanding the r i s k s associated with an 
increasing reliance on electricity - an economic activity that presently has a single-market and brings 
high dependence on a single-commodity export - power trade may be considered to be a sustainable 
“win-win situation” for both countries in the long term given that: 
Although construction costs o f hydropower projects in India are similar, i t i s much easier to 
implement power projects 
in Bhutan since they do not face the more complex 
intergovernmental, regulatory, and social and environmental issues that complicate large 
power projects in India; 
The current deficit and increasing demand for power in India w i l l absorb any power 
production in Bhutan, especially when the cost o f power i n Bhutan i s l e s s than the marginal 
cost o f production i n India; 
By funding the construction of hydropower projects, India i s providing Bhutan w i th a 
permanent stream o f reasonably predictable revenues, which w i l l help mitigate any reduction 
in grant support from India; and, 
These long-term agreements have mutual benefits and financial flows in each direction, 
which provide incentives for a stable economic relationship between both countries. 

On the other hand, despite the rapid pace o f development underpinned by hydropower 
exports, Bhutan remains largely rural, w i th barter the primary means o f exchange in some remote 
areas. Agriculture remains an important sector in t h e economy, but i t s share o f GDP i s experiencing 
a long-term decline. Although the sector currently accounts for about a quarter o f GDP, most 
agriculture in Bhutan i s s t i l l subsistence-based, taking place outside the modern economy. M o s t 
significantly, the sector represents the majority o f income, employment, and food security for most 
Bhutanese, especially for the poorest.” No t surprisingly, once hydropower i s se t aside, the country’s 
economic’ picture changes dramatically, and despite the efforts to provide widespread access to 
infrastructure and social services, the income level for most o f the rural population remains low. 
Given these circumstances, over the medium term, the Royal Government believes that one o f i t s 
greatest challenges i s ensuring that growing revenue from hydropower exports i s invested in a 
sustainable and equitable manner that does not trigger inflation, distort the economy, induce “Dutch 
disease,” or exacerbate income disparities and regional imbalances. 

22. 
At the same time, expanding productive activities beyond the current mainstay o f public 
sector-led. investment and hydropower development w i l l be critical for generating employment and 
income opportunities. As detailed below, the 9FYP/PRSP places a renewed emphasis on promoting 
the development o f a dynamic, competitive, and strong private sector in Bhutan. The private sector, 
however, faces d i f f icu l t challenges such as the small size o f the market, entry regulations, lack o f 
skilled and unskilled domestic labor, inadequate infrastructure, and disadvantages related to the 
country’s location - landlocked and relatively isolated from major markets - and geography, which 
contributes to high transportation costs. In general, the private sector needs to grow beyond the 
traditional concentration in trading and construction, while labor market practices need to be more

Debt Management and Foreign Financing Needs 

23. 
To achieve the targets o f the amb i t ious 9FYP/PRSP, RG o B has availed i t s e l f increasingly o f 
foreign loans. Pub l ic debt, in te rna l and external, i s expected t o reach about 100 percent o f GDP in 
FY05 due t o the development o f Tala, the con t inu ing de f ic i ts stemming largely f r om efforts t o 
expand pub l ic services in the ru ra l areas, and the acquisition o f the n ew airplanes. Indeed, based on 
the current l e v e l o f debt, Bhu tan qua l i f ies f o r 100 percent grant f inanc ing under IDA 14 (see Section 
IV-B regard ing IDA a l loca t ion) . Ex terna l debt consists exc lus ive ly o f med ium- and long-term

I t rose t o US$530 m i l l i o n at the end of June 
2004, o r more than 80 percent o f GDP, compared w i t h 42 percent o f GDP in FYOO. The b u l k o f the 
increase i s associated w i t h the development o f Tala, w h i c h continues at an annual expense o f almost 
10 percent o f GD P per year. T h e pro jec t i s being financed by India, 60 percent in grants and 40

accounts f o r almost h a l f o f Bhutan’s external debt stocks, and I n d i a i s Bhutan’s largest fore ign 
creditor. The purchase o f two A i rbus passenger je ts f o r DrukAir at the end o f 2004 was financed by 
domestic borrow ing , ra is ing debt stocks by the equivalent o f US$78 m i l l i o n .

management. Three ma jo r hydroe lec tr ic power plants - Chhukka (336 M W ) , Basochu (56 MW), 
and K u r i c h h u (45 MW ) - curren t ly account f o r around 38 percent of government revenue (excluding 
grants), and once Ta la i s completed this percentage w i l l r i s e sharply. However , as explained above, 
the net impact o f Ta la may be smaller than expected because large repayments w i l l commence once 
the project i s completed, and Go1 has signaled i t s in ten t ion to reduce program grants. The latter i s 
c r i t ica l since grants have been a key par t o f the macroeconomic p ic ture o f Bhutan, in some years 
exceeding the to ta l im p o r t b i l l . 
I n d i a in particular prov ided budget support program grants 
equivalent t o almost 2 0 percent o f to ta l revenue and grants in FY05, n o t inc lud ing f inanc ia l

Assum ing that revenues f r om Ta la come o n stream in FY07 , and exc lud ing po ten t ia l new 
power projects financed w i t h add i t iona l borrowing, sustainability analyses and stress tests b y the 
International Mone ta ry Fund (IMF) and the W o r l d Bank suggest that the debt p r o f i l e should be 
manageable over the medium term (see Attachment 4 f o r details o n p u b l i c and external debt 
dynamics). A l though debt has r i s e n sharply in recent years, an impo r tan t m i t i g a t i n g factor i s that 
most o f the country’s external debt i s concessional, and the debt service r a t i o has risen more s low ly 
than debt stocks, reaching 5.3 percent in m id-2004 f r om 4.8 percent in m id-2000 . I t shou ld be noted 
that the Ta la pro jec t i s n o t inc luded in the 9FYPERSP or the budget, but these large projects are 
included in the debt sus ta inab i l i ty analysis and t o a limited extent in the f isca l sus ta inab i l i ty analysis.

O f f i c i a l medium- and long- term flows o f fore ign a i d amounted t o US$94.5 m i l l ion ,

to provide strong support, f inanc ing the development o f hydropower, roads, education, and other key 
development investments and programs. FDI i s attracted m a i n l y by the t o u r i sm sector, par t icu lar ly

Political and Governance Aspects 

Bhutan Country Assistance Strategy 

27. 
A process o f p o l i t i c a l change and decentralization i s fully underway under the leadership o f 
His Ma jes ty K i n g Jigme Singye Wangchuck, who has governed Bhu tan since 1972 with the support 
o f a Na t iona l Assembly and a Counc i l o f Ministers. Since the late 199Os, the King has increasingly 
delegated govern ing functions t o these bodies. The Counc i l o f M in is ters , w h o are elected by t h e 
Na t iona l Assembly, have been delegated full executive au thor i ty since 1998, w h i l e the post o f Pr ime 
M in is te r (who heads the cabinet) i s rotated annually among the f i v e m in is ters w h o received the mos t 
votes. L o c a l elections were he ld recently, and a w r i t ten constitution, a imed at creating a democratic 
po l i t ica l system consistent with the country’s vision, values, and culture, i s almost f ina l ized . A dra f t 
o f the cons t i tu t ion was w i d e l y d is tr ibu ted on Ma rch 26, 2005.’’ A f t e r w ide consultation, the dra f t 
Cons t i tu t ion w i l l be adopted and then enacted b y the N a t i o n a l Assembly. Acco rd ing t o the dra f t 
Constitution, the Parliament o f Bhu tan w i l l inc lude a N a t i o n a l Counc i l and a N a t i o n a l Assembly. 
The former w i l l consist o f 20 members d i rec t ly elected b y the people and representing each o f the 
dzongkhags (districts), and f ive members nom ina ted by the King. The N a t i o n a l Assembly w i l l have 
a m i n im um of 75 members elected by each Dzongkhug accord ing t o i t s p o p ~ l a t i o n . ’ ~ To ensure the 
integrity o f the electoral process, po l i t ica l parties, w h i c h do n o t ex is t at the momen t in the country, 
wou ld be funded by the R o y a l Government through an E lec t ion Comm iss ion . 

28. 
Decen tra l iza t ion has been advanced t o reduce loca l dependency o n the central government 
and enhance the vo ice o f loca l communities. This e f fo r t has been fo rma l ized through the creation o f 
local development committees at the dzongkhag and geog levels. These committees, whose 
members are elected representatives o f the loca l communities, have been empowered to formulate 
plans and make decisions fo r socioeconomic development programs, and t o propose issues f o r 
debate in the Na t iona l Assembly. S ign i f ican t ly , a process was started in 2002 t o transfer f inanc ia l 
powers and responsibilities t o loca l development committees, and budgets earmarked f o r projects in 
each d is tr ic t and b l o c k are presently under their pu rv iew . The committees have also been 
empowered t o re ta in ru ra l taxes and mob i l ize loca l f inanc ia l resources. New revenue sources are 
needed, however, as ru ra l taxes account f o r o n l y a sma l l p ropo r t ion o f tax revenues. 

29 . 
T o promote decentralization, the 9FYPPRSP lays ou t a three-level imp lemen ta t ion process 
o f d irec t relevance t o the CAS : (i) central-level programs, such as r u r a l e lec tr i f ica t ion , ru ra l access 
roads, r u r a l telecommunications, and human resource development that require large investments, 
h igh levels o f techn ica l expertise, and inter-dzongkhug coordination; (ii) dzongkhag-level programs, 
inc lud ing programs w h i c h require inter-geog coordination, ins t i tu t iona l strengthening, and capacity 
development; and (iii) geog- leve l programs t o promo te social and r u r a l infrastructure development, 
cover ing ac t iv i t ies such as, 
i n t e r alia, irr iga t ion , farm roads, outreach c l in ics , p r ima ry and 
commun i ty schools, suspension bridges and mu le tracks, and r u r a l water supply. Impor tan t ly , the 
education sector rece ived the largest budget share at the dzongkhug level, and the agr icu l ture sector 
the largest share at the geog l e v e l . A l though geogs are responsible f o r imp lemen t ing the ir o w n 
programs, dzongkhugs are expected to supervise, ensure qua l i ty con tro l , and prov ide technical 
support. F ina l ly , a Depar tmen t o f L o c a l Governance has been established t o coordinate and support 

‘’ The constitution was drafted by a 39-member committee established in November 2001. The committee was chaired by 
the Chief Justice, and included members such as, inter a l ia , the Speaker o f the National Assembly, two representatives o f 
the ecclesiastical bodies, and one elected member from each dzongkhag. During the drafting process, the committee 
reviewed constitutions from over 50 countries.

than 100,000 ethnic Nepalese l i v i n g in camps in eastern N e p a l since the ear ly 1990s. Acco rd ing to 
RGoB, many o f the people curren t ly in the camps had been l i v i n g in Bhu tan i l lega l ly , wh i le others 
l e f t vo lun ta r i ly o r have never actually l i v e d in Bhutan. Reso lv ing the issue requires ve r i f ica t ion o f 
claims i n an environment that has no t always been conducive to a timely and systematic process. 
Since October 1993 , the governments o f Bhu tan and Nepa l agreed t o v e r i f y the peop le in the camps 
according t o specific categories: (1) bona fide Bhutanese who may have been f o r c e f u l l y evicted; 
(2) Bhutanese who emigrated; (3) non-Bhutanese people; and, (4) Bhutanese who comm i t ted 
c r im ina l acts. A Joint Ve r i f ica t ion Team (JVT) consisting o f senior o f f ic ia ls f r om bo th countries 
was established in December 2000. In 2003, Bhu tan and Nepa l agreed that peop le be long ing to 
categories 1, 2, and 4 w o u l d be repatriated o r resettled according t o t h e i r respective citizenship 
laws.2’ However, an attack o n the Bhutanese members o f the J V T in December 2003 during a v is i t 
to one o f the camps adversely affected the ver i f ica t ion process. RG o B has expressed concern about 
the secu r i ty o f N T members g iven the recent increase in the insurgency in Nepa l , and the poss ib i l i ty 
that the camps cou ld be in f i l t ra ted b y rad ica l groups. Nevertheless, R G o B has expressed i t s full 
comm i tmen t to f ind ing a las t ing and durable so lu t ion through a b i la tera l process with Nepal. The 
Bank w i l l continue to mon i to r the progress made, and the concerned UN agencies a re p rov id ing

Environment and Natural Resources 

3 1. 
The R o y a l Governmen t has demonstrated a strong comm i tmen t t o sustainable development, 
and the conservation o f b iod ivers i ty and the environment. Env ironmen ta l conservation has been 
guided since 1998 b y the N a t i o n a l Env ironmen t Strategy prepared by the N a t i o n a l Env ironmen ta l 
Comm iss ion (NEC). In 2000, the Env ironmen ta l Assessment A c t was passed t o establish procedures 
f o r the assessment o f po ten t ia l effects o f strategic plans, programs, policies, and pro jec ts on the 
environment. N E C has since adopted several env ironmen ta l codes o f best prac t ice f o r hazardous 
waste management, so l id waste management, sewage and sanitation, and urban roads and tra f f ic . As 
part o f the decentralization process, environmental committees have been established in the 20 
dzongkhags o f the country. 

32. 
Concrete progress has been made through the Bhu tan Env i ronmen ta l Trust Fund (BTF).22 
One-third. o f the country’s areas have been set aside f o r conservation purposes, with 26.2 percent 
declared protected areas, plus a recent “Gift t o the Ear th” o f another 9 percent f o r w i l d l i f e corridors 
t o prevent habitat fragmentation. Unde r the BFYP/PRSP, the R o y a l Government i s also engaged in a 
concerted e f fo r t t o develop wha t it ca l ls the renewable natural resources (RNR) sector, w h i c h 
comprises crop and l ives tock production, forestry, f a rm roads, and na tura l resource management. 
Three-quarters o f Bhu tan i s covered in forests, and this sector i s impor tan t f o r the r u r a l poo r in terms 

” The enactment o f the Geog Yn rg y e Tshogchung (GYT) and Dzongkhag Yargye Tshogchung (DYT) Chathrim (Act) has

Those in category 2 w i l l be given the option to apply for citizenship i n either country, while those in category 4 would be 
given the opportunity to prove their innocence i n a court o f law. 
22 The original US$IO m i l l ion grant to BTF in 1992 was the first environmental endowment by the Global Environment 
Facility (GEF) and i s recognized worldwide as an important innovation in donor financing for biodiversity conservation. 
The Trust Fund also provides scholarships for two Master’s degrees per year. Co-financing from other donors in addition 
to growth in the endowment’s capital brought the Trust Fund’s assets to US$36 m i l l ion before the market reversal o f

o f fodder, fuel wood, and b u i l d i n g material. Forestry accounts fo r about 10 percent o f GDP, bu t i t s 
indirect con t r ibu t ion i s much larger in t e rm s o f the pro tec t ion and maintenance o f so i l and water 
regimes (especially g iven Bhutan’s h i g h reliance on hydro-power). 

33 . 
A l t h o u g h Bhu tan has a strong conservation ethic, erosion, deforestation, and overgrazing are 
issues o f increasing concern, especially in more densely populated areas. The ongo ing process o f 
decentralization cou ld fa l ter i f clear cr i ter ia f o r evaluating tradeo f fs between conservation and 
development are no t developed and agreed upon by communities and government alike. Moreover, 
because env ironmen ta l leg is la t ion i s re la t ive ly new, the decentralization o f the environmental 
management respons ib i l i t ies f r om NEC t o the line M in is t r ies has o n l y occurred o n a l im i t e d scale. 
A t the same time, the imp lemen ta t ion and mon i to r ing o f the po l ic ies at the dzongkhug levels are 
weak and p u b l i c in fo rma t ion i s limited due t o human and capital capacity constraints. 

3 4 . 

Bhu tan faces t w o central challenges concerning env ironmen ta l management: ecological 
pressure due t o rap id urban iza t ion and weak environmental management capac i ty in the l ine 
M in is t r ies and at the loca l levels. Emerg ing eco log ica l pressures f r om r a p i d urbanization and 
development are pos ing a threat to t h e natural environment that w i l l requ ire e f fo r ts beyond the 
conventional approaches t o b iod ive rs i ty conservation. Bhutan’s rap id u rban g row th rate i s large ly at 
the expense o f forested slopes, scarce agr icu l tura l land, and wetlands. This degradation trend i s 
resu l t ing in adverse impacts, with 10 percent o f agr icu l tura l land n o w a f fec ted by water erosion, 
wh i le loca l ized and seasonal water shortages as w e l l as increased sediment loads in some rivers are 
also on the rise. The latter 
i s a c r i t ica l issue, especially cons ider ing tha t the country’s 
macroeconomic g row th prospects are highly dependent o n ensuring a re l iab le supply o f water fo r the 
hydropower sector.

There has been l im i t e d experience in the preparation, imp lemen ta t ion and mon i to r ing o f 
environmental impact assessments (EMS) and environmental management f r om the l ine M i n i s t r i e s , 
and dzongkag and geog levels. Whereas there has been some e f fo r t in building the capacity o f the 
technical s ta f f o f each leve l , extensive development ac t iv i t ies are t a k i n g place at a much higher rate 
than the capac i ty-bu i ld ing ac t iv i t ies . Therefore, there is a need t o con t inue the in tens ive capacity-

Development Challenges

Access ib i l i ty i s t h e d e f i n i n g deve lopmen t i s s u e i n B h u t a n . Bhu tan i s a small, landlocked, 
and mountainous coun try fac ing structural and geographical constraints and the pressures o f g loba l 
competition. The m a j o r i t y o f i t s popu la t ion lives i n small, remote, and scattered ru ra l settlements, 
separated by rugged mountainous ranges. The absence o f roads i s a ma jo r con t r ibu t ing factor to 
poverty. Under these circumstances, greater access through in fras truc ture expansion i s essential to 
improve social services and increase economic opportunities, and consequently, t o ensure that 
Bhutan continues to make progress towa rd a t ta in ing the MDGs. T h e coun try ’s r o a d ne twork totals 
4,153 k i lome ters ( 6 2 percent paved) and more than 4,300 k i lome ters o f m u l e tracks. Yet many 
communities remain isolated and dependent on animal and head-load transport. Presently, 50 
percent o f the popu la t ion l ives within one hour’s wa lk f r om a road, w h i l e one- th ird o f the geogs have 
no mo tor ized access. N o t surprisingly, loca l communities assign a high p r i o r i t y to r u r a l roads and 
the upgrading o f m u l e tracks t o a l l ow the passage o f power t i l l e r s . Moreover , desp i te the abundant 
supply o f re la t ive ly cheap hydroe lec tr ic power, 65 percent o f the popu la t ion lacks e lec tr ic i ty .

Sectors such as hea l th and education, w h i c h RGoB has successfully promoted, demand large 
recurrent ’expenditures in order t o make full use o f the n ew l y created assets. The country’s

mountainous terra in makes road construction and maintenance immensely challenging. In addition, 
road construction in Bhu tan i s based, f o r the most part, o n obsolete technology and practices wh ich 
affect road qua l i ty . As a result, some segments o f the road ne two rk are vulnerable t o landslides and 
f lood ing , especially during the monsoons, increasing ove ra l l rou t ine maintenance costs. 
I n par t 
because o f these issues, w h i c h are c r i t ica l t o the sustainability o f i t s ambitious programs, RGoB i s 
f i n d i n g it increasingly d i f f i c u l t t o meet i t s objective o f f inanc ing recurrent expenditures f r om

Need f o r em p l o ym e n t genera t ion , p a r t i c u l a r l y f o r y o u t h . A l though s t i l l comparatively 
low, the unemployment rate almost doubled between 1998 and 2004, increasing f r om 1.4 percent t o 
2.5 percent o f the econom ica l ly active population. T o a great extent, this trend i s due t o the fact that 
grow th in employment opportunities has lagged re la t ive t o the g r ow i n g cohorts o f school leavers and 
graduates. There i s also a m isma tch between the type o f j o b s that the educated you th w o u l d prefer - 
desk j o b s in general, such as in the c i v i l service (h is tor ica l ly the m a i n source o f employment) or i n 
the corporate sector - and the employment opportunities generated by the economy, especially 
manual labor in the nascent pr iva te sector. Moreover , w h i l e j o b s in the c i v i l service are no t so 
read i ly available anymore, the pr iva te sector’s capacity to generate attractive j o b opportunities i s s t i l l 
l im i ted . Simultaneously, due to the changing expectations among the youth, rura l-urban m igra t ion 
and lost o f interest in agr icu l ture has resulted in a g r ow i n g p o o l o f j o b seekers in urban areas and 
large towns. 

3 9 . 
An immediate challenge i s that, presently, a s ign i f ican t p ropo r t ion o f young men and women 
i n urban areas have l i t t l e education, and they face d i f f i c u l t y in finding employment. Three-quarters 
o f a l l urban males between 20 and 25 have no t completed p r im a r y education, and this group i s far 
l e s s likely to f i n d a j o b (relative t o those w i t h p r ima ry education). Women are also very vulnerable 
since their education levels are typ ica l ly l ow . Acco rd ing t o the BLSS, among urban men aged 20- 
25, 11 percent are unemployed, 2 5 percent are s t i l l enro l led in schoo l or no t yet available f o r the 
labor market and o n l y 64 percent are work ing . Y o u t h unemp loymen t does n o t necessarily result in 
poverty, at least in i t ia l ly , when many young men and women l i v e with their parents. However, 
unemployment i s l i k e l y t o jeopardize the future o f young peop le as they become heads o f households 
or assume some f am i l y responsibilities. 

40. 
Emp loymen t generation, par t icu lar ly f o r youth, i s already a ma jo r concern f o r RGoB. As the 
leve l o f education increases in Bhu tan and more ch i ldren graduate f r om p r ima ry and secondary 
school (consistent w i t h the country’s education strategy), the coun try w i l l need to create more jobs t o 
absorb them. Y o u t h unemployment, unless addressed, may also create social problems in the 
med ium t o l o n g term, h inde r ing the achievement o f the coun try ’s v is ion . I t i s pro jec ted that between 
2001 and 2010 approx ima te ly 90,000 school leavers and graduates w i l l be produced b y the school 
system. As the current fo rma l sector wo rk fo rce i s o n l y 60,000 and a fh-ther 22,000 are in the c i v i l 
service or. pub l ic institutions, the creation o f an add i t iona l 90,000 j o b s poses a form idab le challenge. 
Th is challenge i s made more d i f f i c u l t b y the fact that the pr iva te sector relies o n fore ign workers 
w h i l e b u i l d i n g na t iona l capacity. As a result, at the same t ime tha t unemp loymen t among nationals 
has increased, the number o f w o r k perm i ts fo r fore ign workers has reached 37,000, and in addition, 
7,000 t o 8,000 foreigners are emp loyed as day workers in towns near the b0rder .2~ Cons ider ing these 
factors, labor po l ic ies need to strike a balance between fac i l i ta t ing p r iva te sector g row th and 
max im iz ing oppor tun i t ies f o r generating attractive employment f o r the Bhutanese. In this respect, 
the Ministry of Labo r and Human Resources (MoLHR) i s studying the wage structure, employment 
practices, and w o r k i n g cond i t ions in the pr iva te and corporate sectors. 

‘’ In addition, i t i s estimated that between 5,000 and 8,000 foreigners a re illegally in the country.

Bhutan Country Assistance Strategy 

41. 
Bhutan i s experiencing rapid rates o f urbanization, while facing limited availability of 
livable and serviced urban land. Between 2000 and 2003, the estimated average annua l grow th o f 
the urban popu la t ion in Bhu tan was over 7.0 percent, and in Thimphu, the K i n g d om ’ s capital, i t was 
as h igh as 10 percent. H a l f o f the country’s popu la t ion i s expected t o l i v e in c i t ies by 2020, mak ing 
urbanization and reg iona l development a top na t iona l p r io r i ty . Thimphu, in par t icu lar , i s fac ing 
increased demand f o r residential and commerc ia l space and pressure o n ex is t ing urban infrastructure. 
So l id waste management i s also a g row ing c0ncern .2~ A ma jo r challenge w i l l thus be h ow to 
p r io r i t ize fu tu re investments in re la t ion t o ru ra l and urban areas, especially be tween Thimphu and 
reg iona l towns, and t o promo te a more balanced reg iona l development process. In general, growth- 
oriented investments in urban infrastructure are needed t o a l l ow f o r urban expansion w i thou t 
negative effects such as ove rc rowd ing and a p ro l i fe ra t ion o f underserved and s l um areas. A t the 
same time, the capacity o f urban ins t i tu t ions responsible f o r urban management and infrastructure 
services have t o be strengthened substantially i f c i t ies and towns in Bhu tan are t o sustain the benefits 
o f infrastructure development. 

42. 
T o increase ru ra l incomes, the challenge for Bhutan w i l l be to diversify and 
commercialize within a limited market. Bhu tan i s thinly populated but o n l y 7 . 8 per cent o f the 
land i s arable. I t has many scattered areas o f f e r t i l e so i l w i t h generally good wa te r supply, but the 
few va l leys suitable f o r agr icu l ture are under increasing compe t ing demand f r om urban iza t ion . Food 
produc t ion f r om the nine t rad i t iona l crops i s generally su f f ic ien t t o support an adequate per capita 
food consumption leve l at 2500 kca l , above the South Asian average. Howeve r , subsistence 
agriculture i s re la t ive ly extensive and exacerbates land scarcity issues. L a n d ho ld ings are already 
fragmented and small, and fa rm mechanization i s very l im i ted . Cash crops, pa r t icu la r ly h i t and 
horticulture, have demonstrated the po ten t ia l t o increase and d ive rs i fy f a rm incomes, con tr ibu t ing 
not on ly t o food security but also t o mee t ing household needs for cash and i n t e n s i f y i n g land use. 
However, the lack o f roads o r a i r f re igh t means that agr icu l tura l exports w i l l b e v e r y limited for a 
l o n g t ime to come. In add i t ion t o poo r r u r a l access and the loss o f farm land t o u rban settlement, 
constraints to g row th inc lude l o w and dec l in ing ava i lab i l i ty o f f a rm labor, l a c k o f financing, 
depredation o f crops b y w i ld l i fe , and a lack o f economic infrastructure t o increase value-added in 
agriculture. 

43. 
Private sector growth in Bhutan i s hampered by the small size o f the market, the lack 
o f supportive infrastructure, and the comparatively high costs o f doing business. The W o r l d 
Bank, in co l labora t ion with the Ministry o f Trade and Indus try (MTI) and the B h u t a n Chamber o f 
Commerce and Industry (BCC I ) conducted a Pr iva te Sector Survey in 2002. This survey was the 
first comprehensive analysis o f p r iva te sector issues in Bhutan, and has subsequently he lped i n f o rm 
the 9FYP/PRSP as w e l l as the e f fo r ts o f the Bank Group and other development partners. Findings 
f r om the survey and subsequent analysis show that pr iva te sector g r ow t h i s constrained in Bhu tan b y 
the small size o f the domestic market, high transport costs, and inadequate in fras truc ture ( inc lud ing 
roads, electricity, and telecommunications), regulations, labor marke t issues and skill shortages, 
financing, and a lack o f business development services. Hyd ropowe r deve lopmen t has been, and 
w i l l rema in fo r the foreseeable future, the ma jo r avenue fo r economic grow th . Bhutan’s energy 
expor t ing sector coexists with a sma l l and s low ly modern iz ing non-energy economy. Desp i te e f for ts

To fac i l i ta te a more enabling environment f o r the pr iva te sector, R G o B approved a fore ign 
direct investment (FDI) p o l i c y i n December 2002. The t a r i f f structure was s im p l i f i e d in 2002 and 
the weighted average t a r i f f rate was lowered t o 15 percent. Sales tax and customs du ty on a w ide 
range o f domestic and commerc ia l goods were abolished and the customs duty o n spare parts f o r a l l 
vehicles was reduced f r om 30 percent to 10 percent. To fac i l i ta te im p o r t procedures fo r the private 
sector, the au thor i ty f o r issuing impo r t licenses was transferred in Ju ly 2002 f r om the Ministry of 
Finance to the Ministry o f Trade and Industry. A business fac i l i ta t ion c e l l in Bhu tan was

Enhanc ing the pr iva te sector’s competitiveness -by reduc ing the costs o f d o i n g business and 
imp rov ing governance o f the f inanc ia l sector - are impor tan t areas o f the r e f o rm agenda being 
implemented b y RG oB . Specific areas include: 
*:* 
Expanding physical infrastructure. The lack o f agg lomera t ion economies o f scale, the 
d i f f i c u l t y in ob ta in ing f l a t land, and the h i g h costs o f in fras truc ture development, are 
ma jo r obstacles t o indus tr ia l development in Bhutan. To address t h i s issue, RG oB i s 
p lann ing t o develop several indus tr ia l estates with reliable, cheap power, and to b u i l d a 
d ry p o r t f o r trade fac i l i t ies and services. In addition, I n d i a has agreed t o explore the 
po ten t ia l o f extending ra i lway links to the Bhutanese border. 
*3 Rationalizing entry regulations. As the Bhutan Doing Business Report (W o r l d Bank, 
2005) indicates, t h e time taken t o register a business in Bhu tan i s re la t ive ly long. 
Spec i f ica l ly , i t takes 62 days, w i t h 11 processes, t o register a company in Bhu tan in 
comparison t o the South As ian average o f 47 days (g loba l best prac t ice stands at 2 days). 
Concerted e f fo r ts are be ing made w i t h support f r om IFC’s South A s i a Enterprise 
Deve lopmen t F a c i l i t y (SEDF) t o simplify and automate the reg is tra t ion process. 
0 Labor market issues. Acco rd ing to the Doing Business indicators, labor markets are 
rigid, adversely impac t ing employment. Bhu tan has the least f l e x i b l e labor market in 
South As ia Reg ion (SAR): o n the r i g i d i t y o f emp loymen t index (which captures the 
d i f f i c u l t y o f h i r i n g and firing, the r i g i d i t y o f w o r k i n g hours, and the like), Bhutan’s score 
i s 49 (the same as Pakistan’s), compared t o an average o f 42 f o r SAR . The cost o f firing 
(the cost o f advance no t ice requirements, severance payments, and penalties) i s also one 
o f the highest, standing at 94 times the week ly wage (the S A R average stands at 85 , 
while the coun t ry that fares best in the region i s Bangladesh at 47). Cognizant o f this, 
. RGoB i s trying to develop more f lex ib le labor laws and emp loymen t po l ic ies to reduce 
constraints fo r young people (the most affected b y stringent labor ins t i tu t ions) in finding 
jobs . Spec i f ica l ly , RG oB has drafted an Emp loymen t Adm in is t ra t ion P o l i c y focused o n 
emp loymen t creation and p romo t ion as well as a Labo r and Emp loymen t Ac t . 
63 Skills shortages. On the supply side, labor shortages o f s k i l l workers are a b ind ing 
constraint f o r industry. In this regard, ra is ing the re ten t ion o f ch i ld ren in school through 
secondary education; adapting the secondary schoo l c u r r i c u l um mo re closely t o the 
needs o f the p r iva te sector; and strengthening voca t iona l education, training, and 
entrepreneurship w i l l be c r i t ica l t o ra is ing the ava i lab i l i ty o f s k i l l e d workers. Moreover, 
key instruments f o r assessing labor market s k i l l s - such as enterprise surveys and labor 
force surveys - need t o be strengthened. The Ministry o f Labo r and H um a n Resources 
(MoLHR) i s endeavoring t o ma tch labor supply and demand th rough voca t iona l training,

Wh i le the progress made in raising school enrollment and improv ing gender pa r i ty 
attests t o the p r io r i ty accorded t o education by RGoB, the sector faces several challenges. 
Bhu tan i s comm i t ted t o ach iev ing the in terna t iona l ly agreed targets f o r Educa t ion f o r A l l (EFA) and 
Un iversa l Pr imary En ro l lmen t (UPE). To achieve these targets, RG o B has p rov ided free basic 
education cover ing 11 years f r om pre-pr imary t o class X, and seeks to address problems a f fec t ing 
access to and qua l i ty o f education, inc lud ing shortage o f teachers and classrooms, teaching methods, 
and poor curr icu lum . B o t h the gross enrollment rate (GER) and t h e net enro l lmen t rate (NER) are 
lowe r f o r secondary education than f o r p r ima ry education, although these are expected t o increase 
drama t ica l ly g iven the large cohor t o f girls curren t ly at the primary leve l . Moreover , t o make fur ther 
progress toward gender pa r i ty in education, demand-side measures, such as stipends f o r girls, may be 
needed to o f fse t the d irec t and ind irec t costs o f education, pa r t icu la r ly at the secondary level. At the 
same time, hostels and adequate water and sanitation services, w h i c h have a d irec t impac t on girls’ 
par t ic ipa t ion in education, should be made more available. 

47. 
Dea l ing with the shortage o f teachers i s a c r i t ica l challenge magn i f ied by the need t o b u i l d 
sma l l schools with a single teacher and mu l t i-grade teaching in order t o b r i n g schools closer t o 
communities. Standing curren t ly at 19 percent, teacher absenteeism at the p r ima ry l e v e l i s re la t ive ly 
h igh . Absenteeism in Bhutan, however, i s ma in ly related t o the shortage o f teachers rather than 
teachers not show ing up f o r w o r k (as i s t h e case in other countries w i t h s im i la r absenteeism rates). 
Par t icu lar ly in ru ra l schools, teachers are usually requ ired t o move between classrooms where multi- 
grade teaching i s no t being carr ied out, thus o f ten leav ing one o r mo re classrooms w i thou t teacher 
supervision. 

48. 
A l though teacher qua l i f ica t ions are generally adequate, better teaching methods are needed 
to improve ove ra l l teacher perfo’rmance in the classroom. Bhutan’s system o f pre- and in-service 
teacher education i s compara t ive ly advanced. A Bachelors o f Educa t ion i s requ ired t o become a 
teacher, and regular in-service t ra in ing i s also mandatory. 
In addition, teacher salaries are 
comparable t o other s im i la r cadres in the c i v i l service, w h i c h i s he lp ing attract good candidates t o the 
profession. Nevertheless, an add i t iona l e f fo r t i s needed t o ensure tha t teachers understand and use 
modern teaching methodologies and move away f r om outmoded rotehead-and-repeat teaching s t y l e s .

expanding the health infrastructure dramatically. T h e country n o w con fron ts n e w challenges in

A. 

Key Findings 

54. 
Acco rd ing t o the CAE , the overa l l outcome o f B a n k assistance be tween 1993 and 2003 was 
moderately satisfactory. Due t o the ava i lab i l i ty o f grant a id f r om b i la te ra l donors, the Bank agreed 
w i t h RG oB t o focus f inanc ia l assistance o n a l im i t e d program f o r infrastructure development f o r 
roads, schools, urban water supply and sanitation, fores try management, and more recently, 
H I V / A I D S preven t ion and treatment. Commensurate with this l im i t e d role, the Bank’s impact was 
generally modest. In the case o f the education sector, however, the impac t o f B a n k assistance was 
substantial, w h i l e in other sectors, such as forestry, i t has had m i x e d results. Overa l l , IDA lend ing 
has been large ly c l ien t-dr iven and effective as w e l l as sensitive t o the coun try ’s culture and 
conditions. The Bank prov ided some useful ana ly t ica l w o r k and p o l i c y advice, but Bhutan d i d no t 
benefit as much as it shou ld have f r om the Bank’s non- lend ing services. 

55. 
Co - f inanc ing proved t o be a useful means to coordinate e f fo r ts and max im ize the impact o f 
external resources p rov ided t o Bhu tan . In general, the Bank coord ina ted i t s e f for ts by w o r k i n g w i t h 
development partners and f o l l ow i n g the d iv is ion o f labor promo ted by RG oB . Accord ing ly , the 
Bank supported cap i ta l investments w h i l e basic capacity building, inc luded under most projects 
rece iv ing IDA funds, was usua l ly financed by b i la tera l partners with grants. 

56. 
Impor tan t ly , the C A E and CAS consultations ind ica te some “ insens i t iv i ty t o size” o n the part 
o f the Bank . As in the case o f other small countries, Bhutan’s sma l l c i v i l service cou ld no t easily 
cope w i t h Bank requirements - and simultaneous demands f r om other development partners - 
especially f o r reporting, f inanc ia l management, and procurement. This s i tua t ion was exacerbated by 
the uneven qua l i ty o f pro jec t supervision and the d i f f i c u l t y in f o l l ow i n g up o n c r i t i c a l issues, in part 
because of the lack o f a l o c a l o f f i c e and s ta f f con t inu i ty . Ensu r ing the latter has always been a 
challenge g iven the sma l l p o r t f o l i o size. (See the Section o n P o r t f o l i o Management f o r more detail 

on these issues). 

B. 

Lessons Learned 

57. 
As a re la t ive ly sma l l p layer in a small country, the B a n k finds i t s e l f in a cha l leng ing pos i t ion 
in Bhutan, pa r t icu la r ly cons ider ing the increasing need expressed by R G o B fo r technical and 
f inanc ia l assistance. Unde r these circumstances, several lessons shou ld be taken in to account: 

0 To maximize development impact, Bank assistance needs to emphasize selectivity. 

G i v e n the limited IDA and Bank s t a f f resources available, the B a n k should limit i ts 
engagement t o a f ew areas and sectors and support these con t inuous ly over time. 

Q Selectivity should be balanced with flexibility to respond effectively to new client needs 
emerging from changing country and global conditions. As OED noted, the Bank has 

been mos t e f fec t ive when i t l is tened t o what the government needed. Responding to 
these demands, however, should be care fu l ly balanced with the need t o keep Bank 
assistance selective and focused. 

0 The lending program should be better informed regarding local conditions. As 

advised by OED , the Bank should pursue an integrated approach between i t s lending and 
p o l i c y advice, w i t h up f ron t sector w o r k and development o f clear sector strategies. 

Bhutan Country Assistance Strategy 

19 

*E* Supply-driven assistance, on the other hand, should be avoided, particularly regarding 

non-lending services. Go ing forward, the Bank should undertake a concerted e f fo r t to 
make government counterparts f u l l y aware of what i t has t o o f f e r as well as o f t h e 
po ten t ia l benefits o f certain Bank products. The Bank should also s tr ive to develop and 
imp lemen t a program o f ana ly t ica l and advisory services that i s responsive t o c l ien t 
demands. 

*:* 

Strong donor coordination is required to enhance development effectiveness. 

T h e 
Bank should no t necessarily take the lead in a l l the sectors it supports, and should be 
w i l l i n g t o p lay a complementary role. Co- f inanc ing and other types o f f inanc ia l 
arrangements should be ac t ive ly sought. To compensate f o r i t s lack o f f i e l d presence, 
the Bank should h o l d program consultations at least once a year and w o r k more closely 
w i t h the UN Deve lopmen t Program (UNDP), w h i c h leads donor coord ina t ion in Bhutan. 

0 The Bank should be more sensitive to Bhutan’s capacity constraints. The B a n k should 

take full advantage o f the ongo ing e f for ts t o use coun try f iduc ia ry and safeguard 
systems, and approach “mandated” diagnostic w o r k 
f l e x i b l e manner by 
conso l ida t ing tasks when feasible and ensuring c l ien t buy-in.

wh i le responding to the lessons f r om and b u i l d i n g upon the achievements o f t h e prev ious C A S and 
the progress rev iew o f the 9FYP/PRSP recen t ly completed by RGoB. Acco rd ing ly , the FY06-09 
CAS w i l l support Bhu tan in (i) expanding access t o better infrastructure and soc ia l serv ices , and 
connecting commun i t ies to markets; (ii) p romo t ing pr iva te sector development and employment; and 
(iii) strengthening management o f pub l ic resources, and mon i to r ing and eva lua t ion o f development

the Bank’s development effectiveness i n Bhu tan . To max im ize impact, assistance w i l l be p rov ided

community representatives during the CAS consultations, access i s one o f the most critical 
challenges for Bhutan. Accordingly, the first CAS p i l lar focuses on access to quality in fras truc ture 
and services, as we l l as markets. As discussed below, during the CAS period, the Bank Group w i l l 
specifically support efforts b y RGoB to expand and improve rural road access, improve quality and

Im p r o v i n g r u r a l access and qua l i ty o f road ne two rk to connect communities to social 
s e r v i c e s and markets. Accessibility - a major development i s s u e fo r Bhutan - depends, to a large 
extent, on availability o f appropriate, reliable, and affordable transportation. In fact, given Bhutan’s 
geography, poor rural access i s often synonymous w i th rura l isolation and poverty, while high 
external and domestic transport costs constitute a d i f f icu l t challenge to promoting economic 
development in general and promising sectors such as tourism, horticulture, ago-processing, and

wood-based industries in particular. A major country development goal i s to expand the road 
network to ensure that by 2020, 7 5 percent o f the rural population w i l l live within half a day’s walk 
from the nearest road. Understandingly, the 9FYPPRSP gives a very high priority to investing in the 
road network, including national highways, feeder roads, and basic farm roads. To guide these 
investments, a comprehensive Road Master Plan has been prepared by RGoB. 

63 . 
The Bank has been supporting the expansion o f rural access through the ongoing Rural 
Access Roads Project, which w i l l close in FY06, and plans to continue contributing to this outcome 
through a repeater project (US$S.O million) planned fo r FY07. Through these projects, the Bank 
would support infrastructure investments and quality improvement o f the road network, particularly 
feeder roads, in selected dzongkhugs and geogs, as well as capacity building fo r improved road 
building technology and practices. With respect to the expected direct impact on the rural 
population, initial findings from the socioeconomic impact study conducted for the current roads 
project indicate that the new feeder roads have resulted in time savings o f three days fo r some 
communities coupled with a transition from bartering to cash-based exchange and improved access 
to services. Further benefits to t h e population are expected i f the next project i s successfully 
implemented. Simultaneously, through the existing Decentralized Rural Development Project, which 
w i l l also be followed by a repeater project (US$8.0 million) i n FY09, ass is tance w i l l be provided to 
help connect farmers to services and markets in targeted geogs through the provision o f farm roads 
and bridges, as well as upgrading o f mule tracks t o permit the passage o f power t i l le rs . A l l o f these 
e f f o r t s w i l l build upon recently completed analytical work, including a Transport Sector Note 
(FY04), and ongoing programmatic technical assistance to strengthen the management o f public 
resources, including the piloting o f multi-year budgets i n the road sub-sector (Department o f Roads), 
among others (see CAS Pillar 3 below.) 

64. 
Support to the road sector by the World Bank has so fa r complemented other development 
partners’ efforts. Going forward, coordination w i l l be further intensified and formalized to the extent 
possible. While the Bank Group has focused on financing the expansion o f r u r a l access through 
feeder roads, ADB has been involved in helping strengthen the national highway system. Given the 
substantial financing need, ADB also plans to support construction o f feeder roads i n the future. I n 
terms o f capacity building, ADB has focused on road safety and asset management, while the Bank 
together with the Netherlands Development Organization ( S N V ) - as noted below - have promoted 
and w i l l continue to support the use o f the environmentally friendly road construction (EFRC) 
methods developed under the existing road project as well as building capacity fo r contract 
management. 

Increasing access to adequate urban services in Thimphu and selected towns. As 

6 5 . 
mentioned above, Bhutan i s experiencing rapid urbanization, which i s increasing pressure on 
Thimphu and Phuentsholing - the country’s two main cities - and many large towns. I n response t o 
this challenge, the 9FYP/PRSP emphasizes promoting balanced regional development and a good 
quality o f urban l i f e in the country. The 9FYPPRSP also recognizes that, to meet these goals, 
Bhutan w i l l need to develop a well-governed and strong system o f local governments by, inter alia, 
continuing to advance the decentralization process. As a critical step, the Bank w i l l help RGoB 
prepare a Na t iona l Urban Strategy that w i l l also include a City Development Strategy for T h im p h ~ . ~ ’ 
The objective o f this activity i s to develop a strategy and action plan responsive to the country’s 
culture and values, which w i l l help manage urban growth efficiently and equitably and, at the same 
time, promote balanced regional growth. I n addition, the s tra tegy w i l l help draw up municipal 
financing plans. As i s the traditional practice i n Bhutan, the strategy w i l l be prepared following

66 . 
Simultaneously, the Bank w i l l help finance urban infrastructure and expansion o f serviced 
land, as w e l l as support capacity b u i l d i n g f o r urban management. The ongo ing U r b a n Development 
Project, approved in FYOO, has assisted in imp rov ing urban infrastructure and services in 10 towns, 
and has b u i l t capacity f o r operation and maintenance (O&M) and cost recovery. Building upon the 
Na t iona l U rban Strategy, the second U r b a n Development Project (FYO8, IDA U S $ l O m i l l i o n ) w i l l 
target Th imphu and possibly a few add i t iona l towns t o promote balanced reg iona l development. F o r 
the most part, however, the pro jec t w o u l d help develop o u t l y i n g areas o f Thimphu t o help deal w i t h 
the increased demand f o r residential and business accommodations and the in tens i fy ing pressure on 
infrastructure and ove ra l l urban environment. 
In preparation, the Thimphu C i t y 
Corpora t ion (TCC) and RG oB have developed a comprehensive structural p lan and iden t i f ied 10 
areas (or new townships) f o r expansion o f the city, w h i l e tak ing impor tan t steps t o strengthen the 
legal and ins t i tu t iona l framework o f the urban sector. I t i s noted that imp lemen ta t ion o f the urban

requested ADB to support Th imphu ’s expansion, 
in add i t ion t o f inanc ing investments 
in 
Phuentsholing and Dagana.** T o ensure good coordination, i t has been proposed tha t out o f the 
c i ty ’s I O new areas, ADB w i l l finance investments in the five southern areas and the W o r l d Bank in

CAS Pillar 2 - Promoting Private Sector Development and Employment 
74. 
To ensure the tw in goals o f rapid growth and employment generation for youth, the 
9FYP/PRSP places a high priority on the development o f the private sector, whose potential remains, 
for the most part, untapped. However, policy and regulatory changes are urgently needed in order 
for the private sec tor to play an effective role in generating employment. Among the various sectors, 
agriculture i s s t i l l the mainstay o f rural employment, and as such received focused attention in the 
9FYP/PRSP. In line w i th these priorities, the Bank Group w i l l help Bhutan reduce c r i t i c a l constraints 
to private sector development and increase agricultural productivity and diversification. These CAS 
outcomes are discussed below.

Reducing selected critical constraints to private sector development. The Bank Group 
has been helping promote private sector growth through i t s support to expand and improve 
education, rural access, and urban development. I t has also provided technical assistance in various 
key areas ‘such as the development o f legislation for foreign direct investment (FDI), promotion o f 
small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and capacity building to the Bhutan Chamber o f Commerce 
and Industry (BCCI). Analytical support has been provided through the Private Sector Survey 
(2002) mentioned above, and the Doing Business Report (2005). Finally, shortly after Bhutan 
became an IFC member in December 2003, IFC approved a US$10 m i l l ion investment in the tourism 
sector. 

76. 

Under this CAS, the Bank Group w i l l engage i n a concerted effort to help reduce some o f 
the critical constraints faced by the private sector in Bhutan. Accordingly, bu i ld ing on t h e Private 
Sector Survey and subsequent work, I D A and IFC w i l l collaborate w i th the Foreign Investment 
Advisory Service (FIAS) to provide crosscutting support to help improve the country’s overall 
business environment, while providing focused assistance to potential growth and employment 
generation sectors such as tourism, SMEs, and agribusiness development.

Increas ing ag r icu l tu ra l productivity and diversification in selected geogs. Although the 
agriculture sec tor ’s contribution to GDP has decreased over the years to about one-quarter o f the 
total, i t i s s t i l l the main source o f income and employment for the majority o f the Bhutanese. At the 
same time, poverty in Bhutan i s overwhelmingly rural. To reduce rural poverty, the 9FYPPRSP 
aims at increasing rural income and employment, in addition to improving food security and 
promoting sustainable natural resource management. This also has gender implications given that 
women are the primary producers in Bhutan’s agriculture sector since two-thirds o f them are 
employed i n the sector and 70 percent own land. To achieve this long-term goal, agricultural output 
needs to be increased and diversified at the same time that access to markets i s improved. Given 
these considerations, the 9FYP/PRSP identifies the renewable natural resources (RNR) sector as 
c r i t ica l , and defines this sector comprehensively as comprising o f crop and livestock production, 
farm roads, forestry, and natural resource management. 

83 . 
The Bank Group w i l l be assisting the RNR sector directly through the existing IDA-financed 
Decentralized Rural Development Project (US$7.0 million), and a follow-on project (US$S.O 
million) in FY09. Through these and other projects (see support to crosscutting issues below), as 
well as through analytical and advisory services, the Bank w i l l also support decentralization and 
natural resource management. Specifically, in addition to facilitating access through feeder and farm 
roads (see CAS Pillar l), IDA would support investments in other rural infrastructure, including 
irrigation channels and RNR centers, and agricultural extension services in selected dzongkhugs t o 
provide training in agricultural production and marketing. Irrigated agriculture has been identified as 
an important source o f growth and food security, while RNR centers are envisaged as the frontline 
institution in the effort t o improve productivity and sustainability o f crop, livestock, and forest 
production. As such, RNR cen ters w i l l provide opportunities for farmers, assisted by geog-based 
extension s ta f f , to take advantage o f productivity and income gains through jo in t experimentation, 
knowledge sharing, and capacity building. 
I n parallel, the Bank group w i l l help promote 
agribusiness, considered a priority export sector i n Bhutan. SEDF, in particular, w i l l help implement 
a pilot project under a capacity building program with the National Women’s Association o f Bhutan 
(NWAB). This pilot project, which may be eventually scaled up across the country, w i l l help rural 
women cultivate and market medicinal herbs. I n the medium term, a l l these efforts should result in 
wider adoption o f improved farm technologies and varieties at the household level, better 
agricultural extension services, and employment opportunities i n the rural areas for school leavers, 
and in the longer term, increased food security and rural incomes. 

84 . 

Through the Decentralized Rural Development Project, I D A i s supporting investments in six 
foca l dzongkhugs where there has been l i t t l e , if any, donor activity in the past. At the same time, the 
International Fund fo r Agricultural Development (IFAD) i s providing support i n other h o n g k h g s in 
a similar fashion. In general, the proposed CAS program i s complemented by ADB assistance to 
expand rural electrification and promote micro-credit development, as well as ongoing and planned 
e f fo r ts by the EC, UNDP and WFP to support the RNR sector, and Bhutan and India’s agreement to 
cooperate in agriculture and allied sectors. 
CAS P i l l a r 3 - Strengthening Management o f Pub l ic Resources, and Mon i to r ing and 
Eva luat ion o f Deve lopment Outcomes 

8 5 . 

As emphasized i n the JSAN o f the 9FYPPRSP, Bhutan should (i) strengthen the 
macroeconomic framework and policies; (ii) improve public expenditure management; and (iii) 
bolster poverty monitoring and evaluation. With the expected substantial increase i n revenue from 
hydropower exports, improving controls, planning and execution procedures, and transparency and 
accountability should be given a high priority. Increased public investment w i l l also make more 
urgent the need to tackle the limited capacity fo r measuring development results. As detailed below,

Imp rov ing budget management and public financial management. A well-functioning 
public resource management system i s especially important in Bhutan, where, as per the country’s 
vision, the government i s committed to ensuring equitable and sustainable growth, and the public 
sector plays a major role in the evolution o f the economy. Given capacity constraints, public 
resources are managed reasonably well in Bhutan, though significant issues need to be addressed, 
including weak links between the five-year plan / PRSP and the annual budgeting process. Ensuring 
the maximum development impact o f expenditures from the increasing revenues from hydropower 
exports w i l l require enhanced fiscal discipline and allocative and technical efficiency. Moreover, the 
ongoing process of political and administrative decentralization has led to a paradigm shift i n t h e 
planning and implementation o f development activities, heightening the need fo r greater 
transparency and accountability, as well as increased capacity at the dzonghhwg and geog levels. The 
Royal Government needs to improve the accuracy and consistency o f macroeconomic forecasting to 
help underpin sound revenue projections and inform policymaking. Progress i n this area w i l l depend 
on enhancing coordination between government departments and agencies that produce inputs for 
macroeconomic and revenue forecasts, and on strengthening revenue forecasting capacity. 

87. 
I n recent years, RGoB has taken several important reform steps, including revising the 
Budget Manual in 2001 to call for the introduction o f multi-year rolling budgets. As recommended 
in the JSAN, RGoB has also initiated the process o f establishing a Medium Term Fiscal Framework 
(MTFF) as a f i r s t step towards implementing multi-year rolling budgets (MYRB, more commonly 
known as a Medium Term Expenditure Framework in other countries). Recognizing the need for 
improved coordination, RGoB plans to establish a Macroeconomic Framework Coordination 
Committee (MFCC) whose primary responsibility w i l l be to draw together inputs from across the 
various concerned agencies, and to prepare a coherent set o f macroeconomic projections. These 
would then be used to underpin revenue projections, and define a more realistic resource envelope. 
Simultaneously, RGoB w i l l continue its efforts to improve debt management systems. To ensure 

28

that these e f for ts have a measurable impact, RG oB i s also endeavoring t o increase s ta t is t ica l capacity 
and data ava i lab i l i ty . 

8 8 . 
Pub l ic f inanc ia l management (PFM) has been improved through concrete ac t ions such as the 
establishment o f in terna l aud i t units in each line m in is try and by separating a i d management f r om 
budget and accounts. Ex terna l audits are conduced per iod ica l ly by the R o y a l A u d i t Au tho r i ty 
(RAA) , wh ich has considerable 
independence in practice, although n o t f o rm a l l y . These 
improvements notwithstanding, Bhu tan ’s national systems requ ire further s treng then ing t o b u i l d 
capacity o f the accoun tab i l i ty and oversight institutions, mee t the P F M and transparency demands 
ar is ing f r om the increased revenues and l e v e l s o f government spending in the c om i n g years, and 
ensure that the decentralized ins t i tu t ions have the capacity and practices t o fulfill their P F M roles. 
M o r e specifically, timeliness o f accounting and repor t ing remains an issue, despite t h e in troduc t ion 
o f a Budget Accoun t ing System f o r generating reports. This, in turn, affects mon i to r ing and 
evaluation o f reports, mak ing it more d i f f i c u l t t o undertake t im e l y co r rec t ive measures. A 
substantial gap exists between accounting practice in the country and in terna t iona l standards, and the 
country s t i l l needs t o develop a domestic cadre o f accountants and auditors. The w o r k o f the internal 
auditors deputed to the l i n e ministries remains fo r the most par t ad hoc since t h e y have no t been 
g iven clear terms o f reference. Due to f inanc ia l and manpower constraints, R A A cannot always 
audit every agency once every two years as mandated. 

8 9 . 
The R o y a l Government has recognized the importance o f im p r o v i n g procuremen t outcomes, 
g iven their relevance t o the ove ra l l e f fo r t to strengthen pub l ic expend i ture management. 
Nevertheless, increased capacity t o manage and undertake procurement, w h i c h i s c r i t i c a l f o r e f f ic ien t 
decentralization and the p romo t ion o f good governance, i s s t i l l needed. Procuremen t and 
management o f assets need t o be more effective, and procedures t o rev iew and supervise high-value, 
high-risk procurement should be developed. Progress has cer ta in ly been made with support f r om 
donors, including ADB. M o s t ru les re la t ing t o procurement were rev ised a n d updated in the 
F inanc ia l Manua l pub l ished in 1 9 9 8 , and an A rb i t ra t ion l aw drafted and discussed in 2000. The 
recently drafted F inanc ia l Management L a w contains further revisions o f ru les applicable t o 
procurement. Moreover , techn ica l assistance financed b y ADB has he lped B h u t a n streamline rules 
and regulations, prepare mode l b i d d i n g documents, and establish a reg is tra t ion and c lass i f ica t ion 
system f o i contractors. 

9 0 . 

I n response t o the above needs and priorities, the B a n k G roup w i l l support RGoB’s 
interrelated re fo rm e f for ts t o imp rove macroeconomic forecasting, budget management, and the 
overa l l pub l ic f inanc ia l management (PFM) framework through the Deve lopmen t Po l icy Gran t I 
(FY06) and a po ten t ia l subsequent operation (FY08). Imp lemen ta t ion o f the r e f o rm agenda w i l l be 
supported b y technical assistance prov ided through IDF grants. These include, f i r s t , a new in i t ia t ive 
to strengthen pub l ic expenditure management and promote transparency (US$300,000) approved at 
the end o f FY05 . This i n i t i a t i v e w i l l help R G o B develop and progressively strengthen the M T F F 
and move towards m a k i n g MYRB operational, bolster the ins t i tu t iona l l inkages needed f o r better 
macroeconomic framework coo rd ina t ion and the preparation o f macroeconom ic forecasts, b u i l d 
capacity f o r revenue forecasting within an MTFF, and enhance transparency. Second, an ex is t ing 
activity, based on the findings o f t h e Country Financial Accoun tab i l iv Assessment (2002) i s

As detailed in the coun try program, the Bank w i l l also support this CAS outcome through 
analytical and adv isory services t o increase the understanding o f macroeconomic issues, par t icu lar ly 
those related to sources o f g row th (FY07), w h i l e programma t ic non- lend ing techn ica l assistance

enhance budget transparency; and (iii) m in im ize the need f o r ad hoc budge t-cu t t ing exercises. In 
addition, the Bank w i l l conduct a comparative analysis of pub l ic sector accounting and aud i t ing vis- 
a-vis international standards (GAP analysis) that w i l l he lp R G o B ou t l ine a pa th fo r bringing 
Bhutanese standards closer t o in terna t iona l ly accepted ones. 
I t i s expected that further progress 
du r ing the CAS pe r iod to broaden and deepen accounting and aud i t ing procedures, practices, and 
skills w i l l help strengthen the overa l l pub l ic f inanc ia l management (PFM) framework and the 
transparency o f budget execution, as w e l l as improve the accuracy and timeliness o f na t iona l and 
sub-national f inanc ia l repo r t ing and the internal con t ro l environment. 

92. 
These e f for ts w i l l be guided b y the overarching need t o increase loca l and na t iona l capacity 
f o r f inanc ia l management and procurement so that development partners can r e l y increasingly on 
country systems and make progress on the harmonization agenda. Accord ing ly , W o r l d Bank support 
w i l l b u i l d upon assistance prov ided by other development partners, inc lud ing UNDP , IMF, and 
A D B . UND P has prov ided capacity b u i l d i n g for imp roved p u b l i c expenditure management, w h i l e 
IMF has deepened i t s dialogue on macroeconomic 
issues w i t h R G o B through A r t ic le I V 
consultations and related techn ica l assistance activities, especially o n tax po l icy . ADB assistance has 
helped improve e f f ic iency in day-to-day operations through the compu ter iza t ion o f the budget and 
accounting system, as w e l l as on procurement. 

93. 
I m p r o v i n g c a p a c i t y f o r m o n i t o r i n g a n d assessment o f deve lopmen t outcomes. The 
9FYPPRSP recognizes that pover ty mon i to r ing and eva lua t ion and assessment o f development 
outcomes need to be strengthened. Respectively, the JSAN no ted several ins t i tu t iona l issues that 
should be addressed: The mandate o f the Na t iona l Statistical Bureau (NSB) as t h e central agency f o r 
comp i l ing statistics i s weak in the absence o f a statistics l aw and o f a statistical master p lan . The 
latter should be prepared in coord ina t ion w i t h the proposed Pover ty M o n i t o r i n g and Assessment 
System (PMAS ) to be managed b y the Poverty M o n i t o r i n g Unit under the Department o f Planning. 
Moreover, R G o B should develop a clear se t o f targets and indicators, a l igned with the PRSP and 
MDG targets, and b u i l t consensus around these among key stakeholders. The coord ina t ion o f future 
survey w o r k shou ld also be improved. 
I t i s c r i t ica l tha t d i f fe ren t surveys be comparable for 
government agencies to be able to mon i to r progress on development outcomes over time, and 
conduct impact evaluations. F ina l ly , the repor t ing frameworks at the dzongkhag leve l should be 
consolidated. 

94. 
The R o y a l Government, with support f r om development partners, has undertaken several 
in i t ia t ives t o strengthen pove r ty mon i to r ing and evaluation, inc lud ing the Househo ld Income and 
Expenditure Survey (2000), the p i l o t Bhutan Poverty Assessment and Ana lys is (2000), the Bhutan 
Poverty Mon itor ing and Assessment System Framework Document (2003), 
the Bhutan L i v i n g 
Standards Survey 2003 (BLSS), and most recently, the Poverty Analysis Report (August 2004, based 
on the BLSS). M o r e cruc ia l ly , as noted above, the first N a t i o n a l Popu la t ion and Hous ing Census 
was conducted this year f o l l ow i n g international standards, and data processing and analysis are 
underway. 

95 . 

Deve lopmen t partners have prov ided substantial assistance t o R G o B in i t s e f for ts t o improve 
statistical systems. ADB has a mu l t i-year statistical capacity building TA p rog ram supporting (i) the 
dra f t ing o f the statistics law; (ii) the improvement o f the na t iona l accounts; (iii) the design, 
implementation and analysis o f the household 
income and expend i ture survey in 2000; 

30

( iv) expansion o f data co l lec t ion and dissemination; and (v) the upgrad ing o f statistical capacity. A 
fo l low -up TA program was agreed in November 2004 t o help build the effectiveness o f the Na t iona l 
Statistical Bureau (NSB) and the Statistical Board, improve the comp le t ion o f the na t iona l income 
accounts and strengthen the techn ica l s k i l l s o f N S B staff. Simultaneously, the UN agencies have 
prov ided various forms o f support, inc lud ing development o f the Pover ty M o n i t o r i n g and 
Assessment System (PMAS), the census, and the M&E systems in various sectors. B i la te ra l donors 
have also p rov ided assistance within the sectors that they have been supporting. For instance, 
DANIDA has a strong engagement w i t h the M i n i s t r y o f Hea l th o n M&E f o r improved health 
outcomes. Trad i t iona l ly , the Bank Group has been less engaged in this area, focus ing ma in ly on 
strengthening M&E capacity o f the sectors where it has been involved, especially the education 
sector. 

9 6 . 

G o i n g forward, 
the Bank w i l l broaden i t s assistance in close coord ina t ion or direct 
collaboration w i t h development partners. Areas f o r support inc lude a po ten t ia l grant f r om the Trust

A key challenge for R G o B i s t o make decentralization happen, pa r t icu la r ly at the geog leve l . 
T w o ma jor challenges are the need f o r increased coord ina t ion across various government levels, and

P r om o t i n g d e c e n t r a l i z a t i o n a n d good governance. During the CAS period, the Bank 
wou ld help promo te decentralization through coordinated assistance across sectors (i.e,, in education 
and rura l development), building on the e f for ts described in P i l l a r 3 related t o imp roved pub l ic 
resource management. F o r instance, the renewable na tura l resources (RNR) sector strategy, 
supported b y IDA through the Decentralized Ru ra l Development Project, i s be ing implemented 
w i t h i n the context of, and in support o f decentralization and the empowerment o f l o c a l communities. 
Specifically, this pro jec t w i l l p rov ide capacity bu i ld ing at the loca l l e v e l t o imp rove financial 
management and accounting, engineering skills fo r design and supervision o f ru ra l infrastructure, 
operational capacity f o r water user associations ( W A S ) , and imp lemen ta t ion o f env ironmen ta l and 
social safeguards. A t the same time, the Bank w i l l support decentralization o f school management 
through the ex is t ing Educa t ion Deve lopmen t Project. In particular, leadership and management 
tra in ing w i l l be p rov ided at the dzongkhag leve l t o the d is t r ic t education o f f icers .

Capacity b u i l d i n g in env ironmen ta l management i s an inherent par t o f W o r l d B a n k assistance in 
Bhutan. Generally, IDA-financed projects a im at building capacity in the concerned l i n e ministry, 
dzongkhags, and geogs t o carry ou t their environmental management and m o n i t o r i n g responsibilities. 
M o r e specifically, 
the Bank has supported, and w i l l continue t o promote, the mainstreaming o f 
environmentally friendly road construction (EFRC) techniques developed with support f r om I D A 
and The Netherlands. Ev idence suggests that compliance with EFRC m in im izes environmental 
management requirements and decreases road maintenance costs substantially, although it increases 
upfront investment costs. T h e Bank w i l l also he lp promo te env ironmen ta l ly sound management 
( inc lud ing treatment and disposal) o f b iomed ica l waste under the H I V I A I D S Preven t ion Project. 

100. Comp lemen t ing IDA efforts, a grant f r om the G loba l Env i ronmen t F a c i l i t y (GEF) - with 
para l le l f inanc ing f r om DANIDA - w i l l help promote sustainable land management practices. 
Specifically, the proposed Sustainable L a n d Management Pro jec t (US$7.9 m i l l ion ) , t o be approved 
in FY06, w o u l d foster approaches, tools, and interventions to reverse damage t o land due t o weak 
policies, overgrazing, forest degradation, and unsustainable ag r icu l tu ra l practices. This e f fo r t wou ld 
help broaden the sources o f l i v e l i h o o d and we l l-be ing o f selected loca l commun i t ies in Bhutan. 
Among other activities, the p ro jec t w i l l prov ide bottom-up par t ic ipa tory planning, and through p i l o t

Lending Scenarios. I n FY06, Bhutan’s IDA a l loca t ion w i l l be about US$14.5 m i l l i o n 
equivalent. Based o n the coun try ’s risk o f debt d is tress , Bhu tan w i l l receive 100 percent o f this 
assistance in grants. However, as agreed in the IDA 14 framework, Bhu tan ’s a l loca t ion based o n i t s 
I D A country performance in FY06 has been reduced by 20 percent in order t o address equ i ty and 
mora l hazard issues across a l l IDA countries. Assuming that Bhu tan w i l l con t inue to receive 100 
percent grant assistance f r om IDA , the ind ica t ive a l loca t ion f o r the rest o f the C A S pe r iod w o u l d be 
about US$44.0 m i l l i o n . In this respect, i t should be noted that actual allocations after FY06 w i l l 
depend on (i) the country’s o w n performance; (ii) i t s performance re la t ive t o the performance of 
other IDA countries; (5) the amount o f ove ra l l resources available t o IDA; (iv) changes in the l i s t o f

Nevertheless, a substantial reduc t ion in the a l loca t ion in the outer years o f the C A S i s highly u n l i k e l y 
s ince Bhu tan has been a consistent good performer, as re f lec ted in i t s ra t ings under the country

channeling o f funds t o p r i o r i t y areas iden t i f ied in the CAS . 

107. W i t h respect t o carbon finance, the Bank Group w o u l d p rov ide assistance o n c l ima te change 
issues in partnership with other donors, and w i l l fac i l i ta te RGoB ’s par t ic ipa t ion in the emerging 
carbon market b y p r o v i d i n g assistance in the iden t i f ica t ion and sale o f carbon assets t o the Bank- 
managed funds such as the Pro to type Carbon Fund (PCF) and the Commun i ty Deve lopmen t Carbon 
Fund (CDCF) . One o f the mechanisms available i s the W B CF-Assist program, w h i c h can provide 
capacity b u i l d i n g and pro jec t development technical assistance grants t o build and support the 
designated na t iona l au thor i ty and to enable the development o f specific carbon f inance transactions. 
I n i t i a l consultations have iden t i f ied several areas w i t h good po ten t ia l f o r carbon finance, such as 
hydropower, biomass, and micro-hydro, and the Bank w i l l continue t o w o r k w i th the concerned 
stakeholders t o assist in their development f o l l ow i n g the C lean Deve lopmen t Mechan ism (CDM ) 
guidelines. 

1 0 8 . Expenditure Eligibility under the CAS. Coun try F inanc ing Parameters (CFPs) f o r Bhu tan 
have been prepared and agreed upon by RG o B (see Attachment 9 f o r details). U n d e r the CFPs, IDA 
may finance 100 percent o f a l l pro jec t o r program costs where needed and appropriate. 
Nevertheless, RG o B considers counterpart funding t o be desirable and the Bank w i l l encourage it. 
The CFPs re f lec t the fac t that RG o B has fo l lowed prudent f isca l and debt management po l ic ies in the 
past. A l though a large par t o f government cap i ta l expenditures i s f inanced f r om ex terna l assistance 
(mostly grants), RG oB has bo r rowed f r om I D A cautiously and within the f ramewo rk of the 
9FYP/PRSP, and accord ing t o na t iona l pr ior i t ies iden t i f ied through a coun t ryw ide par t ic ipa tory 
process. Bank pro jec t f inanc ing i s fully integrated in to the budget and thus pa r t o f RGoB ’s overa l l 
prudent and sound f isca l management. At the same time, RG o B has imp lemen ted IDA - f inanced 
projects re la t ive ly successfully, despite challenges’ such as the sma l l size o f the c i v i l service, the 
rugged terrain, scattered population, and d i f f i c u l t communications. T h e f i n a n c i n g parameters f o r 
cost sharing, loca l and recurrent costs, and taxes and duties w i l l be app l ied o n a pro jec t-by-pro jec t 
basis t o ensure e f f ic ien t imp lemen ta t ion and sustainability after pro jec t closure.

DELIVERING THE BANK GROUP’S PROGRAM 
Portfolio Management and Performance 

A. 

109. 
The size o f the p o r t f o l i o in Bhutan has increased in recent years, and w i l l continue t o g row 
dur ing the imp lemen ta t ion o f the new CAS . A s o f August 2005, there were six ac t ive IDA-financed 
operations, w h i l e in the past the average p o r t f o l i o size has been about 3 t o 4 operations. These 
operations represented US $ 8 0 m i l l i o n in n e t commitments and US$47 m i l l i o n in undisbursed funds. 
Wh i le two o f these projects (Education I1 and U rban Development) w i l l close in 2005, 
implementation o f the rema in ing projects w i l l continue until 2009 . In the past, lend ing has been 
lumpy: US$5 .4 m i l l i o n in FY94 , US$13.7 m i l l i o n in FY98 , US$22.4 m i l l i o n in FYOO, US$36.8 
m i l l i o n in FY04 , and US$7.0 m i l l i o n in F Y 0 5 . Under the proposed strategy, lending w o u l d be more 
continuous, with at least one new grant o r credit prov ided every f isca l year. 

110. 
As detailed in the C A S Comp le t ion Report (see A t tachmen t 6), p o r t f o l i o performance 
mon i tor ing and assessment, o n the one hand, and supervision o f the coun try p rog ram o n the other, 
have faced several challenges. Regard ing the former, the m a i n issue i s tha t every single pro jec t in 
Bhutan counts in Bank reports o f coun try p o r t f o l i o performance. In other words, the sma l l size o f 
the po r t fo l io makes some o f the indicators used by the Bank t o m o n i t o r and assess po r t fo l io 
performance d i f f i c u l t t o apply. Presently, a l l projects are rated satisfactory, and ove r t im e p o r t f o l i o 
risk indicators have rema ined close t o and have occasionally been be t ter than reg iona l and Bank

averages. The disbursement ra t io has been close t o o r above 20 percent recently, although this figure 
hides differences in disbursement performance across projects. 

11 1. 

Bank supervision has been constrained b y n o t hav ing a l o c a l o f f ice in the country, and 
RG oB prefers a d irec t re la t ion with the Bank in Washington. The sma l l p o r t f o l i o size has intensified 
the challenge o f ensuring s ta f f con t inu i ty and focused a t ten t ion o f management. At the same time, 
Bhutan’s geography demands t ime and resources no t o f ten available t o ensure even supervision 
across project sites. Furthermore, the country program d i d no t have a dedicated Operations Adviser 
u n t i l recently, w h i l e in-coun try and in-depth p o r t f o l i o performance rev iews have never been 
conducted in the case o f Bhu tan . 

112. During the CAS period, the Bank w i l l pay close a t ten t ion t o qua l i ty a t en t ry and project 
supervision to ma in ta in the qua l i ty o f the po r t fo l io and ensure b o t h smooth pro jec t implementation 
and successful achievement o f pro jec t outcomes. An add i t iona l e f f o r t w i l l be made t o f o l l ow up 
more consistently, while pro jec t res truc tur ing w i l l be conducted f o r projects w i t h persistent 
problems. Special attention w i l l be pa id t o the project’s M&E systems t o make sure they are 
realistic, adequate, and supportive o f the overa l l framework f o r m o n i t o r i n g PRSP and CAS 
outcomes. 

B. 

Partnerships and Harmonization 

113 . D o n o r support in Bhutan i s aligned w i t h the 9FYP/PRSP, and their areas o f focus reflect, f o r 
the most part, the R o y a l Government’s suggestions and requests as w e l l as their comparative 
advantage. There i s no fo rma l L o c a l Consultative G roup (LCG) in the country, but U N D P has 
adequately taken o n the ro le o f donor coord ina t ing agency. Pa r t ia l ly because o f i t s secondary 
f inanc ia l ro le and lack o f a loca l office, the Bank has not t rad i t iona l ly p layed a lead ing ro le in donor 
coordination in Bhutan. Nevertheless, du r ing CAS implementation, the Bank plans to enhance i t s 
interaction with UNDP , ADB, and other development partners. 

114. 
Several donor sub-groups have been created recen t ly and p o i n t agencies and s ta f f have been 
nominated to fac i l i ta te in terac t ion with multilaterals, such as the Bank , and other b i la tera l donors 
lack ing a loca l o f f i c e in the country. U N D P w i l l also continue t o assist the Government organize the 
round-table donor meetings. 

115. Ha rmon iza t ion i s a c r i t ica l issue fo r donor coord ina t ion and pro jec t imp lemen ta t ion in a 
small coun try such as Bhutan. Sma l l size and good governance make Bhu tan a good candidate f o r 
further reliance o n coun try systems, and a coun try tha t can bene f i t substantially f r om the Bank’s 
simplification agenda. During the C A S period, the Bank, in close coord ina t ion with development 
partners, w i l l strive t o rely incremen ta l ly on coun try ins t i tu t ions and procedures, i n i t i a l l y through 
sectors where capacity t o ensure compliance o f safeguards and f iduc ia ry requirements i s considered 
to be re la t ive ly adequate. At the same time, capacity w i l l be strengthened in weak sectors I areas, 
wh i le the coun try team w i l l endeavor to max im ize the oppor tun i t ies t o reduce transaction costs and 
project processing by app ly ing in Bhutan, t o the extent possible, the s imp l i f ica t ion agenda as w e l l as 
max im iz ing the u s e o f new po l ic ies such as the f l e x i b i l i t y in expenditure e l i g i b i l i t y . 

116. 
To fac i l i ta te the above process, the Bank has started in FY06 an e f f o r t t o understand better 
the country systems re la ted t o social and env ironmen ta l safeguards, as w e l l as procurement and 
f inanc ia l management. I t i s expected that this w o r k w o u l d help i d e n t i f y areas where coun try systems 
need strengthening t o bring them closer t o equivalence t o the Bank’s, and if possible t o other donors’ 
safeguard po l ic ies . While w o r k i n g w i t h R G o B and donors to promo te t h e harmon iza t ion agenda,

this w o r k w i l l i n i t i a l l y he lp iden t i fy the extent o f app l icab i l i ty o f the coun try sys tems to Bank- 
financed projects, and the steps needed to ensure this app l icab i l i ty . 

Monitoring Implementation and Results 

C. 
117. 
The resu l ts m a t r i x described in Section IV -A and Attachment 8 indicate a se t o f p r i o r i t y 
outcome objectives that the Bank expects to in f luence during the C A S period, ou tcome indicators to 
measure impact, and intermediate ind ica tors / milestones that w i l l be used t o assess progress toward 
these outcomes. 

118 . Gender w i l l continue t o be mainstreamed through the pro jec t design o f IDA - f inanced 
operations in Bhutan, as i t was done recently in the HIV/AIDS Preven t ion Pro jec t and the 
Decentralized Ru ra l Deve lopmen t Project. The gender-specific impac t o f Bank assistance w i l l be 
mon i tored whenever feasible. 

119. 

Imp lemen ta t ion o f the 9FYP w i l l finish in June 2007, and the 1 0FYPPRSP w i l l cover FY07 
t o FY 11. As such, t h e CAS Progress Report, w h i c h shou ld be prepared towards t h e end o f FY07, 
w i l l be a c r i t ica l instrument to assess progress in CAS implementation, and ad jus t the strategy t o 
address any changes in p r io r i t ies a n d o r coun try conditions. 

V I . MANAGING R I S K S 

120. Key E c o n om i c Assump t ions . The successful imp lemen ta t ion o f the 9FYP/PRSP, which the 
proposed C A S supports, i s predicated o n several assumptions. I f these do n o t materialize, the 
development progress o f Bhu tan w o u l d be seriously imper i led . G i v e n the dependence o n 
hydropower (expected t o account f o r about 25 percent o f GDP and about 50 percent o f to ta l 
government revenues once Ta la comes o n stream), a key assumption i s that the s t rong commercial 
t i e s w i t h I n d i a w i l l continue, i n v o l v i n g bo th the sale o f e lec tr ic i ty and the f i n a n c i n g o f new 
hydropower projects. Deve lopmen t prospects w i l l also h inge o n con t inued donor support, especially 
f r om India, wh ich has agreed t o p rov ide program grants through the las t year o f t h e 9FYP/PRSP, 
though at lower leve ls . F ina l ly , the macro- framework assumes that macroeconom ic management 
w i l l continue t o be sound in the years ahead, ma in ta in ing t h e f i x e d exchange rate, con ta in ing 
in f la t ion , and managing f isca l imbalances and debt stocks. These r i s k s are m i t iga ted by the 
h is tor ica l ly strong t i e s between Bhu tan and Ind ia , and the Go I ’s recent agreement t o increase the 
power t a r i f f pa id o n e lec t r ic i ty sales f r om Chukha. The R o y a l Government i s a lso endeavoring t o 
strengthen i t s macro / f isca l management capacity, and these e f fo r ts w i l l be suppor ted du r ing C A S 
implementation. Moreover, the coun try continues t o ma in ta in a high l e v e l o f reserves to ensure the 
sustainability o f the exchange rate p a r i t y with the I n d i a n rupee. 

121. P o l i t i c a l Reform. As no ted above, a new Cons t i tu t ion i s be ing f ina l ized , w h i c h in the 
med ium term i s to hera ld a democra t ica l ly elected na t iona l government. The impac t o f this o n the 
po l i t ica l process i s d i f f i c u l t t o forecast. The democratic machinery, in t e r m s o f f o rm i n g p o l i t i c a l 
parties, managing the e lec tora l process, and ensuring adequate adv isory suppor t for the Na t iona l 
Council, may face capacity constraints. However , the process being f o l l ow e d i s highly par t ic ipa tory 
and be ing paced t o a l l ow na t iona l capacity building t o imp lemen t the requ i red changes in t h e 
po l i t ica l system. P o l i c y makers have shown strong comm i tmen t t o imp lemen t ing the r e f o rm agenda 
underpinning the country’s 9FYP/PRSP. 

122. N a t u r a l / E x t e r n a l Hazards. The mountains in Bhu tan are compara t ive ly young in 
geological terms, and monsoon- induced landslides are a s ign i f ican t risk, damag ing roads and lead ing 
to the phenomenon o f g lac ia l lake outburst f lood ing . Bhu tan i s also vu lnerab le t o other po ten t ia l 

Bhutan Country Assistance Strategy 

3 7 

hazards outside o f i t s control, such as epidemics l i k e SARS and avian in f luenza o r terror ism in other 
parts o f the w o r l d hurting tourism. F o l l ow i n g the September 11 attacks in the United States and 
epidemic outbreaks in Asia, tour is t arrivals to Bhu tan f e l l sharply, and it has taken three years fo r the 
number o f tour is t arr iva ls t o re tu rn t o previous levels. 
Im p r o v i n g land management, using 
environmentally friendly road construction methods, p r o v i d i n g adequate resources f o r operations and 
maintenance, and m o n i t o r i n g g lac ia l lakes prone to bursting, are some o f the relevant m i t iga t ing 
factors. An add i t iona l risk i s the possible re-emergence o f disturbances in border areas w i t h India, 
wh ich cou ld imp inge the movement o f goods and people in Bhutan and ha rm trade w i t h Ind ia . 
Bhutan and India, however, continue to collaborate closely t o ma in ta in the s i tua t ion under control. 

123. C a p a c i t y Issues R e l a t e d t o Am b i t i o u s Ta rge ts a n d Inc reased . Revenue. 
The 
implementation o f government programs and initiatives, especially in the area o f decentralization, 
faces capacity constraints. 
I n general, managing donors active in Bhu tan i s cha l leng ing at the 
various government levels. Capacity i s par t icu lar ly weak at t h e loca l level, and at times loca l 
o f f ic ia ls f i n d i t d i f f i c u l t t o imp lemen t donor-financed projects. In addition, governance institutions 
for ensuring transparency and accoun tab i l i ty w i l l need to be strengthened as the revenues f rom Ta la 
accrue, if these are to have m a x im um development impact. These r i s k s are m i t iga ted by strong 
leadership, ongo ing e f for ts t o steadily b u i l d capacity, and g r ow i n g e f fo r ts t o improve donor 
coordination and harmonization, and t o use country systems as these a re strengthened. There i s also 
a good precedent in the case o f Bhu tan that despite capacity constraints, increased revenues f r om 
hydropower development have been used e f f ic ien t ly to promo te coun try p r io r i t ies regarding human 
development and infrastructure. H is tor ica l ly , RGoB has spent heav i ly o n services aimed at helping 
the poor, such as p r ima ry education, p r ima ry health, and ru ra l access. T o help the government in this 
endeavor, i t was agreed t o make strengthening the management o f p u b l i c resources a p i l l a r o f this 
CAS . 

124. D e v e l o pm e n t Po l icy-Based F i n a n c i a l S u p p o r t . As no ted above, 
the proposed 
Development P o l i c y Gran t (FY06) i s the first policy-based operation in Bhutan. There i s a risk that 
the preparation o f the operation may no t proceed at the needed pace, and i t may take longer to de f ine 
the components o f the re fo rm program t o be supported by the Bank o r t o imp lemen t some o f the 
agreed actions. A delay i n the DPG w o u l d heighten the need f o r domestic f inanc ing . Nevertheless, 
RGoB has demonstrated i t s comm i tmen t to the re fo rm agenda, and the deepening o f the p o l i c y and 
re form dialogue should he lp m i t iga te th is risk.

Progress Toward Achieving the Millennium Development Goals 

1. 
G o a l 1: E r a d i c a t e E x t r em e P o v e r t y and H u n g e r . The R o y a l Government remains 
comm i t ted t o pover ty reduction, as re f lec ted in the high share o f spending a l loca ted t o sectors such 
as education and health. The MDG objective of reduc ingpover ty by h a y b y 2015 i s likely to be met 
assuming sustained government commitment, robust economic growth, and the com ing on stream of 
Tala. Simple projections us ing the B LSS under a hypo the t ica l scenario show tha t pover ty cou ld 
decrease f r om 31 .7 per cent in 2003 t o 9 per cent in 2015 if the bene f i ts o f g row th are distributed 
equally. 2 9 

2. 
G o a l 2: Ach ieve U n i v e r s a l P r i m a r y E d u c a t i o n . Bhu tan has made tremendous gains since 
it started the e f fo r t to bring fo rma l education t o a l l parts o f the coun try less than 30 years ago. N o t 
o n l y has access t o education been expanded, but qua l i ty has also improved . As men t ioned above, the 
gross enrollment rate (GER) at the p r ima ry leve l was over 92 percent in 2003. T h e net enrollment 
rate (NER), however, remains much l ow e r than GER, ind ica t ing age-by-age m isa l ignmen t and 
internal ine f f ic iency due t o late en try , repetition, and early dropout.30 Spec i f ica l ly , the BLSS 
indicates that the NER at the p r ima ry leve l was 69 percent na t iona l ly and 65 percent in ru ra l areas in 
2003, w h i l e s ign i f ican t differences in enro l lmen t rates were evident across consump t ion quintiles, 
even w i t h i n ru ra l and urban areas and despite education being free. Presently, o n l y one- th ird o f the 
students who start attending schoo l complete the p r ima ry cyc le o n time. A concerted effort is thus 
requ ired ifBhutan is to meet the Education MDG by 2015. 

3. 
G o a l 3: P r om o t e G e n d e r E q u a l i t y a n d Em p o w e r Women . Comparatively, Bhu tan i s a 
country w i thou t exp l ic i t d isc r im ina t ion towards girls or women and the gender gap has decreased 
substantially. The latter has been underpinned b y pos i t ive trends in girls’ l i te racy and access t o 
education. L i te racy rates have increased much faster fo r girls than f o r boys, and over the past 
decade, g ir ls ’ p r ima ry enro l lmen t rate has been nearly tw i c e the rate o f boys’ enro l lmen t . In fact, 
Bhu tan i s close to reach ing gender pa r i ty at the p r ima ry level. 

4. 
Despite such progress, however, gender disparities remain. Forma l ly , w om e n en joy equal 
opportunities, entitlements, and lega l status, but there are gaps in areas such as h igher- leve l 
education and en te rp r ise development. I n education in particular, net and gross enro l lmen t rates and 
literacy rates are s t i l l h igher f o r boys than f o r girls. Acco rd ing t o the BLSS , en try rates are on ly 56.5 
percent f o r girls against 72.0 percent f o r boys. 3 ’ These gender differences stem, t o a great extent, 
f r om the emphasis s t i l l g iven t o t rad i t iona l gender ro les and the lowe r access t o p u b l i c services 
experienced b y g i r ls given that distance i s more constraining fo r them than f o r boys. In general, 
there i s a need to develop methodologies t o conduct gender disaggregated analysis and measurable 
indicators to assess progress on ach iev ing gender equality. I t is unclear whether Bhu tan w i l l be ab le 
to meet the gender MDG by 2015, but for i t to succeed, specific measures a re required, such as 
increasing g i r ls ’pa r t ic ipa t ion in schools. 

29 

These projections assume an average GDP growth r a t e o f 5 . 5 percent per year and a population growth rate o f 2.5 
percent, under a scenario o f constant inequality. 
”International norms do not often capture adequately Bhutan’s unique circumstances. A lower NER, for instance, i s 
partially explained by the fact that in rural areas many children are too small at 5 and 6 years o f age (the standard age for 
tabulating NER) to reach schools. Usually, children do not begin the primary cycle until they a re 7 or 8 years old, when 
they are better able to manage the rugged terrain. 
” Entry rates are defined as the share o f 13 to 19 years children who have ever attended school.

Goa l 4: Reduce Ch i ld Mo r ta l i ty . Na t iona l hea l th surveys ind ica te that in fan t mo r ta l i ty i s 
likely t o have decreased f r om 102.8 to 60.5 between 1984 and 2000 and under- f ive m o r t a l i t y f r om 
162.4 to 84.0 over the same per iod . However , Bhu tan has a lowe r performance than Bo l iv ia , a 
country in the same range o f per capita GDP and similar geography. 

6. 
I t is likely that Bhutan w i l l meet the MDG objective of reducing by two-thirds the under-jTve 
mortality. This w o u l d im p l y that the country’s in fan t and under- f ive m o r t a l i t y rates w o u l d have to 
decrease to 4 1 and 30 respectively, bu t some indicators c lose ly correlated w i t h c h i l d m o r t a l i t y are 
s t i l l very l ow . First, in ru ra l areas, on ly 77.0 percent o f the popu la t ion has access t o safe water. 
Second, cook ing on open f ires in poo r ly ventilated houses i s common and i s responsible f o r 
respiratory illnesses, w h i c h are s t i l l the m a i n cause o f under- f ive mo r ta l i ty . Third, in r u r a l areas, o n l y 
49.0 percent o f the deliveries are med ica l ly assisted and o n l y 28.4 percent o f the deliveries occur in a 
hosp i ta l o r a ma tern i ty ward. The p ic ture i s better in urban areas, bu t even there a quarter o f the 
deliveries s t i l l occur at home w i thou t any med ica l assistance. Fourth, a na t ionw ide E P I survey 
conducted in 2001 reveals that o n l y 64.5 percent o f the l e s s than one-year-olds had rece ived v a l i d 
vaccine doses. Any e f f o r t t o further decrease c h i l d m o r t a l i t y w o u l d at minimum need t o focus on 
these fou r areas. 

7 . 

Goa l 5: Decrease Ma te rna l Mo r ta l i ty . Based o n the na t iona l hea l th surveys, it i s estimated 
that maternal mo r ta l i ty ra t io decreased f r om 7 .7 per 1000 l i v e births to 2.6 between 1984 and 2000. 
I t is likely that Bhutan w i l l reach an MMR of 1 .4 by 2015, thus meeting the objective of reduc ing the 
Ma terna l M o r t a l i y Ratio (MMR) by three-quarters. However , ma terna l m o r t a l i t y rates are d i f f i c u l t 
to measure and resu l ts shou ld be interpreted with care. The m a i n areas f o r po ten t ia l progress are 
prenatal care (on ly 66 percent o f the pregnant women in r u r a l areas rece ived prenatal care in 2003), 
med ica l attendance at birth, and nu t r i t ion ( i ron intake i s o f ten too low, w h i c h i s a m a j o r source o f 
anemia). 

8 . 

Goa l 6: Combat H IV , AIDS, Ma la r ia , and Other Diseases. Though 
isolated 
geographically, Bhu tan i s n o longer imperv ious t o H I V / A I D S . Bhu tan i s at an early stage o f the 
epidemic (UNAIDS estimate an HIV prevalence o f 0.01 percent o f the population), bu t i s 
experiencing exponential g row th o f detected cases. The coun try also exh ib i ts many risk factors, such 
as h igh rates of sexually transmitted infections, m u l t i p l e sexual partners, commerc ia l sex, and high 
m o b i l i t y w i t h i n and outside the country. r f t h e country deals w i t h the challenges discussed below, it 
may be able to curb H I V / A I D S successfully.

Goa l 7: Ensure Env ironmenta l Sustainability.

P o w e r S e c t o r in Bhutan 

1. 

As pa r t o f the R o y a l Government’s re fo rm agenda, the powe r sector in Bhu tan was 
restructured through the E lec t r ic i ty Act 2001, The former Department o f Power o f the Ministry o f 
Trade and Industry (MTI) was d iv ided in to three entities: (i) The Department o f Energy responsible 
for p lann ing and p o l i c y in the power sector, (ii) the Bhutan E lec t r ic i ty A u t h o r i t y as an independent 
en t i ty to license and regulate power companies, and (iii) t h e Bhutan Power Corpora t ion as a 
transmission, d is t r ibu t ion and supply company. In addition, there are three state-owned generation 
companies: Chukha, Ku r ichu , and Basochu Hydropower corporations. To ga in economies o f scale, 
these three companies w i l l be merged in the near future. 

2. 
The m a i n features o f the power sector are as fo l lows : the number o f connections in the 
country are about 52,000 (40 percent ove ra l l access); the transmission and d is t r ibu t ion losses are 
below 13 percent; and the r e t a i l ta r i f fs are U S $ 0.022 cents per unit, w h i c h are compensated by a 
subsidized bulk supply tariff f r om the generation companies (US$ 0.75 cents). The sector’s 
expansion p lan sets a target o f 5 6 percent access rate by 2007 and un iversa l access by 2020. The 
expansion plans are be ing financed by grants and so f t loans f r om ADB and Government o f Aus tr ia . 
The installed capacity in the coun try (468 M W ) exceeds the demand (105 MW), and the surplus 
energy (about 3 0 0MW ) i s curren t ly exported t o Ind ia . 

3 . 
The hydropower sector w i l l continue t o be the ma jo r d r ive r o f g r ow t h f o r Bhu tan in the l o n g 
term, as it has been f o r over the past two decades. The sector con tr ibu ted to more than 20 percent o f 
overa l l g row th between F Y 8 6 and FY04; since the late 1990s, the cons truc t ion w o r k o f Ta la alone 
has raised GD P by about 5 percent. Presently, e lec tr ic i ty exports - a l l o f w h i c h are to I n d i a - 
represent 40 percent o f a l l exports o f goods and services. Cruc ia l ly , once Ta la comes o n stream, the 
share o f hudget revenue f r om the sector w i l l increase f r om one third t o one h a l f and the share o f the 
sector in GD P t o 25 percent. Overall, Ta la i s likely t o resu l t in a jump in rea l GDP o f over 18 
percent, despite the expected contraction in the cons truc t ion sector.34 In contrast, the impac t on 
employment generation has been modest. Nevertheless, the u s e o f fo re ign labor, equipment, and 
materials during the cons truc t ion o f ma jor hydropower p lans has m i t iga ted the pressure o n domestic 
resources. 

4. 
The Government o f I n d i a (GoI) has p layed a key r o l e in f inanc ing hydropower projects in 
Bhutan. Thus far, domestic resources have o n l y been used t o develop Basochu (64 MW in total). In 
this case,’ R G o B con tr ibu ted w i t h 10 percent o f to ta l cost. Moreover , a substantial po r t ion o f 
construction costs have been covered b y grants - 60 percent under the arrangement with I n d i a and 25 
percent i n the case o f Aus tr ia . In addition, I n d i a has p rov ided the rema in ing 40 percent as loan (20 
years ma tu r i ty and 9 percent in te res t rate in rupees). Chukha Hyd ropowe r P lan t (336 MW ) , financed 
b y GoI, was comp le ted under these arrangements, and the loan w i l l b e repa id in two years. Ta la 
Hydropower Pro jec t (1 0 2 0MW ) has been financed under the same approach at a to ta l amount o f 
US$l. 16 b i l l i o n . Acco rd ing t o IMF estimates, a l l hydropower pro jec ts are expected t o ma in ta in 
positive cash f l ow s and favorab le rates o f return. 

5 . 
Bhu tan has o n l y s tar ted t o tap i n t o i t s hydropower po ten t ia l . T h e goals in the hydropower 
sector as stated in the BFYPRRSP are t o strengthen the econom ic self-reliance o f t h e coun try by 
rea l iz ing the e lec tr ic i ty generation capacity (the goal i s t o ins ta l l add i t iona l 2700 MW capacity by 
2020); to p rov ide adequate, safe and re l iab le e lec tr ic i ty th rough sustainable and env ironmen ta l ly

IMF estimates; for further details see A r t i c l e I V Report, June 2005.

expansion w i thou t comp rom is ing the country’s v is ion o f balanced g r ow t h and cu l tu ra l and 
environmental preservation. The tour ism sector grew s trong ly in 2004, and the number o f tourist 
arrivals reached 9,249, exceeding the peak reached in 2000, before the September 1 1, 2001 terrorist 
attacks in the Un i ted States, and the 2003 outbreak o f SARS in East As ia . A b o u t a third o f the 
tourists t o Bhu tan come f r om the U n i t e d States. Some advances have been made in deve lop ing the 
sector i n recent years to fac i l i ta te in terna t iona l access t o Bhutan, w h i c h i s one o f the ma jor 
constraints t o tour ism development. Druk Air (a pub l ic company and the o n l y carr ier f l y i n g t o 
Bhutan) purchased two new aircraft, representing an US$78 m i l l i o n investment. A l though these 
planes are a ma jo r f inanc ia l comm i tmen t f o r the RGoB, equivalent t o 10 percent o f GDP, they have 
increased passenger capacity by 42 percent over the ex is t in aircraft, as well as p r o v i d i n g additional 
cargo capacity that shou ld he lp the nascent export sector!6 With I F C financing, two new luxury 
hotels ’have been established, and the loca l Tashi Commerc ia l Co rpo ra t ion has also begun the 
construction o f a ma jor ho te l in Thimphu that w i l l be run by the India-based T a j ho te l group. 
Tourism, however, suffers f r om the seasonality o f the market, l im i t e d access t o the country, lack o f 
tourism infrastructure, and generally inadequate standards o f accommodation. The sector i s also 
subject to international fluctuations, as demonstrated by the f a l l in tou r is t arr iva ls a f ter the September 
11 events. To prov ide mo re strategic d i rec t ion to t h e sector, the Governmen t o f A u s t r i a i s he lp ing 
RGoB develop a tour ism master plan.

A g r i - p r o c e s s i n g i s another po ten t ia l source o f g row th in Bhutan, and has been iden t i f ied as 
a p r io r i ty expor t sector. A t present, the agri-processing business in Bhu tan consists o f a w ide range 
o f products inc lud ing ag r icu l tu reho r t icu l tu re , non-timber forest products, and l ives tock . In t e rm s o f 
the percentage o f f i r m s by indus t r ia l sector, agro-based and forest-based indus tr ies are the two 
largest. B o t h industries are dominated by the pr iva te sector, and p rov ide emp loymen t t o a large 
number o f people. 

4. 
The sector faces several challenges, however, due t o the dispersion o f the population, 
general remoteness, and the d i f f icu l t ies o f transport and communications. Coup led with this, farmers 
incur heavy losses t o the i r ou tpu t due t o w i l d l i f e and post-harvest damages, amoun t ing t o as much as 
30 to 40 percent o f to ta l produc t ion . L a n d i s re la t ive ly expensive f o r Bhutanese t o acquire, since the 
d i f f icu l t terrain makes arable land ve ry scarce. As a resu l t , ho ld ings are t y p i c a l l y sma l l and 
fragmented. The m a j o r i t y o f farmers are sma l l peasant farmers, at or just above subsistence. Under 
these conditions, generating a surplus i s a challenge. L a b o r input per unit area i s generally high. 
Trad i t iona l ly , the agr icu l ture system in Bhutan has depended o n crop farm ing , l ives tock rearing, and 
forestry products. However , popu la t ion g row th has increased the pressure o n Bhutan’s limited 
natural resource base, pa r t icu la r ly arable land. Nonetheless, oppor tun i t ies f o r p r iva te sector 
development i n these sub-sectors ex is t i f concerted inroads are made in addressing the b ind ing 
business environment constraints.

5 . 
While existing yields in agricultural and horticultural crops are generally poor, the use o f 
improved varieties and better management practices could readily double or triple yields. 
Horticulture i s one o f the most promising areas: i t accounts fo r nearly a l l agriculture exports and 
half o f the total value-added in the sector, though accounting for only 7 percent o f the crop area. The 
Royal Government plans to investigate the market potential o f new crops, the requirements to 
position the products as premium products, and the needs for transport, packaging, harvesting, 
collection, sorting and grading, and seeds. Much needs to be done i n providing appropriate labor- 
saving technology and efficient post harvest and agri-processing methods, so that productivity o f 
labor per unit area i s enhanced. 

6. 
W i th huge potential in India and Bangladesh, most fresh Bhutanese products can be sold 
easily as long as they are properly graded and packed with attractive brands. For these high-value, 
low-volume products, the strategy also should be to capture niche markets i n developed countries, 
stressing that the products are organic. There are opportunities also to increase t h e cultivation and 
export o f sub-tropical fruits (c i t rus and mangoes), winter vegetables, strawberries, plums, cherries, 
pears, exotic mushrooms, as well as organic products such as red r ice . I n total, Bhutan could 
conceivably achieve a target o f agricultural exports o f about US$30 m i l l ion over the coming decade, 
or approximately three times current export levels?’ 

7 . 

A second area o f potential l i e s in exploiting the high-value and low-volume non-timber 
forestry products such as mutsutuke mushrooms, Cordyceps sinensis (Chinese caterpillar fungus, a 
high-altitude medicinal product), and lemongrass oil. A l l o f these products command very high 
prices in export markets. With i t s rich forests, Bhutan could also be a major supplier o f medicinal 
and aromatic herbs and plants. The natural availability o f these products could be increased through 
better husbandry and commercial cultivation. Markets fo r these products in the United States and 
Europe are growing rapidly. 

8 . 

The Royal Government considers information and communications technology (ICT), 
and the knowledge-based industries that it enables an attractive source o f economic growth, and has 
formulated a strategy to guide ICT development in the country. ICT plays both to Bhutan’s strengths 
and avoids the country’s major constraints. For instance, ICT services would take advantage o f the 
disciplined, English-speaking workforce and relatively developed telecommunications network. Yet 
it would not be constrained by the mountainous terrain, extreme weather, and geographic isolation. 
I n addition, ICT services would not impose a large burden on the country’s na tura l resources, and i s 
highly compatible with the country’s goal o f preserving the natural environment. The ICT sector i s 
s t i l l in i t s infancy in Bhutan, and it w i l l take some time before the country i s able to export 
significant ICT services or knowledge-based products. I n the meantime, rapid development o f the 
sector holds enormous promise for improving productivity and increasing competitiveness in 
existing private sector industries. 

9 . 

With respect t o forestry, dialogue between RGoB and the private sector has shown 
promising results. The recently formed Wood-based Industries Association has been engaged on 
such issues as domestic timber auctions and export o f semi-finished products. Private sector 
investment in the forest sector has significant potential t o provide incremental employment 
opportunities in the near term. However, promoting growth and expanded employment through 
forest products industries w i l l require an improved investment climate with rational and stable 
marketing and pricing policies, expanded opportunities to export value-added wood products, 
adoption o f 
improved processing 
technology, and strengthened management capacity.

Public and External Debt Dynamics3’ 

1. 
Background. Bhutan’s pub l ic and p u b l i c l y guaranteed (PPG) debt increased f r om 42 
percent o f G D P i n FYOO t o 87.5 percent in FY04, and i s expected t o peak upon comp le t ion o f the 
Ta la Hyd ropowe r Project in FY06 at about 103 percent o f GDP. In FY05, pub l ic deb t was already 
expected t o r ise substantially due t o the large projected f isca l de f ic i t . The latter, a t the same time, 
r e f l e c t s the purchase o f the t w o new airplanes f o r DrukAir at a cost o f about 10 percen t o f GDP . 
Ex terna l PPG debt (about 80 percent o f GDP) was comprised o f Nu 14.2 m i l l i o n (close t o 48 
percent o f GDP) in I n d i a rupee debt and US$216 m i l l i o n (33 percent o f GDP) in convertible 
currency. Domes t ic debt amounted to 7 percent o f GDP, mos t ly related to the issuance o f bonds to 
finance the n ew airplanes. 

2 . 

The sharp increase in pub l ic debt i s mos t ly related to external b o r r ow i n g f o r hydropower 
projects. In FY04 debt related t o these types o f projects, wh ich are no t inc luded in the budget, 
totaled 56 percent o f GDP, o r about 60 percent o f the to ta l debt stock. Nevertheless, debt service 
obligations related t o loans f o r the hydropower sector seem manageable. Moreover , hydropower 
projects are projected t o ma in ta in pos i t ive cash flows and favorable rates o f re turn . 

3 . 

Outlook o f Debt Dynamics. Ex terna l PPG debt i s projected t o r i s e until FY07 and rema in 
i n a decline trend thereafter. In FY07 a dec l in ing trend in t h e debt-to-GDP r a t i o i s pro jec ted t o start, 
assuming con t inued high GDP g row th and modera t ion o f the f isca l deficits. In FY07 a f a l l o f 16 
percentage po in ts o f GD P i s projected, re f lec t ing the jump in GDP. A decline in average o f 6 
percentage o f GDP per annum should continue afterwards. I t should be no ted that n e w hydropower 
projects, w h i c h w o u l d a l ter the anticipated trajectory, have n o t been inc luded in these projections. 
Nevertheless, under several stress tests, to ta l PPG debt remains in a dec l in ing trend, assuming 
moderate f isca l policies. O n the other hand, although p r im a r y f isca l de f ic i ts have averaged more 
than 6 percent o f GDP in the last fou r years, the ir e f fec t on debt dynamics has been l im i t e d by the 
country’s good economic performance and the highly concessional t e rm s o f the debt 

4. 
In N P V terms, external debt i s projected t o peak around 75 percent o f G D P in FY06 and 
decline around 45 percent o f GDP by FY10.39 The largest source o f decline i s due t o the decline in 
rupee debt obligations, as powe r sector loans are pa id o f f . T h e NPV o f rupee loans i s expected t o 
decline f r om 54 percent o f GDP in FY06 t o 25 percent by FY10. Conver t ib le currency debt i s 
projected t o rema in broad ly stable around 20 percent o f GDP. 

5 . 
The ra t io of debt service t o to ta l exports o f goods and services i s expected t o average 15-1 6 
percent du r ing FY06-10. By currency, the ra t io o f conver t ib le currency debt service t o hard 
currency ‘exports o f goods and services i s projected t o average 18.25 percent; the r a t i o o f rupee debt 
s e r v i c e to rupee exports i s pro jec ted t o average 15.25 percent.

This Section i s based on the Fund’s Bhutan - StaffReport for the 2005 A r t ic le I V Consultations, June 3,2005 
According to the IMF Article I V Report, computation o f NPV for external PPG debt i s underpinned by t h e following 
assumptions: For convertible currency debt, the NPV calculations are based on discounting the debt service payments 
(amortization plus interest) by the OECD Commercial Interest Reference Rate (CIRR). For simplicity, the discount rate 
used i n the computation i s five percent for a l l convertible currency loans. In the absence o f a CIRR for rupee loans, the 
discount rate assumed for Indian rupee debt i s 11.75 percent. This reflects t h e pre- and post-shipment lending rates o f 
scheduled commercial banks in Ind ia for export credits on longer maturities (180-270 days) prevailing around mid-2004. 
I n t h e case o f outstanding rupee debt, interest during construction i s added to the stream o f forthcoming debt service 
payments. For convertible currencies, NPV calculations assume new disbursements consistent w i th t h e balance o f 
payment projections.

(RNR) sector and marketing, f o l l ow e d b y human resources development were also considered 
i m p ~ r t a n t . ~ ’ D e a l i n g w i t h the challenges posed b y the ongo ing decentralization process was a major 
concern expressed at the loca l level, par t icu lar ly regarding capacity t o d e a l with a l l the 
respons ib i l i t ies that have been delegated t o the geog (block) leve l and with donor-suppor ted projects 
as w e l l as with ensuring continuous f l o w o f resources. In this respect, a challenge iden t i f ied at the 
loca l leve l was the p r io r i t iza t ion o f wo rks wh i le ensuring that these rema in w i t h i n t h e ove ra l l p o l i c y 
framework o f the 9FYP/PRSP. Maintenance o f new assets and other related recu r ren t costs were 
p inpo in ted as emerg ing issues by loca l o f f ic ia ls . L o c a l government o f f ic ia ls and commun i ty 
members agreed that decentralization has helped reflect better their development concerns and needs 
in the a l loca t ion o f pub l ic resources. 

5 . 
I t i s clear that pr iva te sector development, g iven the small marke t and Bhu tan ’s geography, 
i s not an easy task f o r RG oB o r the business commun i ty . The pr iva te sector i s s t i l l in a nascent stage, 
and most entrepreneurs are c i v i l service retirees. In the most isolated districts, whe re subsistence 
agriculture s t i l l prevails, development o f commerc ia l ac t iv i t ies i s quite difficult, a n d export-oriented 
ac t iv i t ies even more challenging. P r iva te sector representatives iden t i f ied labor issues as c r i t ica l t o 
the future o f their enterprises, in add i t ion to ava i lab i l i ty o f indus tr ia l land and access t o finance. In 
certain areas, such as engineering and in fo rma t ion technology and commun ica t ions (ICT), national 
capacity i s s t i l l l im i ted , w h i l e i t i s no t always possible o r desirable t o h i r e nationals f o r manual labor. 
I n this respect, i t was f e l t that fu ture labor p o l i c y should recognize the curren t s i tua t ion o f the 
country, w h i l e na t iona l capacity i s increased and pr iva te sector j o b s become m o r e attractive to the

strategic and p o l i c y d irec t ion f o r the development o f the sector in the country, a n d in par t icu lar a 
more streamlined process f o r establishing a business. The capacity o f pr iva te sector associations t o 
promote the ir respective areas was also considered important. 

6 . 

The CAS consultation process helped strengthen the re la t ionsh ip o f the Bank w i t h 
development partners active in Bhu tan . I t was noted by several donors that co - f inanc ing o f IDA - 
supported projects has proved t o be bene f ic ia l t o the country, h e l p i n g leverage resources and 
promote capacity bu i ld ing . O n the other hand, i t was also emphasized that, a l though in some sectors 
the Bank has had l o n g standing partnerships w i t h donors, the Bank has n o t a lways coord ina ted with 
development partners o r commun ica ted strategic decisions that concerned them. 
In add i t ion to 
sector-specific coordination, there were crosscutting areas where a special e f f o r t shou ld be made, 
inc lud ing M&E of pover ty and MDG indicators, macroeconomic statistics, and the analysis and 
strengthening o f coun try systems t o move the harmon iza t ion agenda forward . N o t just lend ing but 
also AAA should be coordinated or developed as shared e f for ts t o a v o i d dup l ica t ion o f work . The 
fact that the Bank does no t have a coun try o f f ice in Bhu tan i s a m a j o r challenge that should be 
m i t iga ted b y w o r k i n g c lose ly with UNDP, w h i c h leads in-coun try donor coord ina t ion , wh i le

T o identify lessons re levan t t o the design and imp lemen ta t ion o f the new results-based CAS, the 
assessment took i n t o consideration: the alignment o f the CAS w i t h the coun try ’s goals and expected 
development results (Section B); the leve l o f achievement o f C A S outcomes be tween FYOO and FY05 , 
and the Bank ’s con t r ibu t ion t o these outcomes (Section C ) ; and the Bank ’s re la ted performance during

Bhu tan possesses a se t o f d is t inc t ive characteristics that have in f luenced B a n k assistance. These 
include, i n add i t ion t o being a small, landlocked na t ion state, hav ing re la t ive ly sound p u b l i c institutions, a 
l o n g trad i t ion o f par t ic ipa tory governance, and a strong development v i s i o n that stresses cu l tura l and 
environmental preservation and investing in people. I n many ways, Bhutan’s par t ic ipa tory development 
p lann ing foreshadows the Comprehensive Development Framework (CDF) adopted by the Bank . The 
country also has substantial hydropower assets, w h i c h i t has started e x p l o i t i n g in a bene f ic ia l manner 
ma in ly w i t h support f r om I n d i a - i t s largest single donor and t rad ing partner.44 Nevertheless, the country’s 
economy remains bas ica l ly agrarian, and the l ive l ihood o f almost 80 percent o f the to ta l popu la t ion 
depends on agr icu l ture and l ives tock . Impor tan t ly , the R o y a l Governmen t o f Bhutan (RGoB) has 
fo l lowed a prudent f isca l and debt management approach, and has endeavored to finance recurrent 
expenditures w i t h domestic resources while re ly ing o n ex terna l grant and highly concessional financing, 
mos t ly f r om b i la tera l donors, f o r cap i ta l investments. A process o f p o l i t i c a l re fo rm and decentralization i s

well as Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs) and assessments by OED and QAG and project supervision documents. 
4 4 India grant aid supports about a quarter o f the Royal Government’s expenditure. Bhutan has a free trade agreement with India, 
which accounts for 80 percent o f the country’s imports and 90 percent o f exports (mainly electricity exports). Moreover, the 
Bhutanese ngultrum i s pegged to the Indian rupee, and imports From India a re payable in rupees. Ind ia has provided grants and 
s o f t loans to help Bhutan complete several hydropower projects, and power i s currently exported only to India.

lend ing was large ly e f fec t ive as w e l l as sensitive t o the country’s cu l ture and conditions. The Bank 
prov ided some use fu l analytical w o r k and p o l i c y advice, but in general Bhu tan did n o t benefit as much as 
it should have f r om the Bank’s non- lend ing services. The CAS expectation tha t the Bank w o u l d p lay a 
prom inen t ro le as a “knowledge bank” in Bhu tan cou ld n o t materialize. While the pr inc ip les o f f lex ib i l i ty , 
selectivity, and partnership w i t h donors underpinned the FY 00 CAS, these were n o t always closely 
fo l lowed du r ing C A S implementation. G o i n g forward, these shou ld be approached mo re strategically. 

A. 

CAS Context 

5 . 
When the C A S was prepared in 1999, Bhutan’s f isca l pos i t ion and medium-term prospects 
seemed favorable, and a i d in f lows stable. Specifically, macroeconomic balances were comfortable, w h i l e 
medium-term economic g row th prospects appeared favorable and grant and concessional a id f lows 
su f f ic ien t t o meet the f inanc ing needs o f the Eighth F ive-Year P lan (8FYP), w h i c h was to be completed in 
June 2002. Be tween 1993 and 1998, Bhu tan received an average o f US$80 m i l l i o n per year in 
disbursements o f concessional assistance, o f w h i c h about 85 percent was grant aid. Accord ing ly , the 
RG oB was p lann ing t o continue i t s p o l i c y o f us ing grant a id from b i la tera l donors and UN agencies 
before requesting mu l t i la te ra l assistance. Nevertheless, RG o B requested ID A f inanc ia l assistance f o r ru ra l 
access roads and urban development, and two credits were respectively appraised during the CAS 
preparation per iod and approved in December 1999. 

6 . 

G iven the above circumstances, in the medium term I D A f inanc ia l assistance was expected t o be 
modest. The Bank had recognized i t s limited and selective ro le in the f i r s t C A S for Bhutan, prepared in 
1993, and focused on economic p o l i c y advice, na tura l resource management, and p r im a r y education. As 
stated i n the FYOO C A S document, IDA ’S support has been p rov ided “on ly when other donors cou ld no t 
put together a timely comb ina t ion o f knowledge, expertise, and f inanc ing as requested by the 
government.” Since Bhu tan had no t accessed Bank f inanc ing in a s ign i f ican t way in the past, accumulated 
commitments in F Y 9 8 totaled US$41.8 m i l l ion , and this to ta l inc luded the Second Educa t ion Pro jec t 
(US$13.7 m i l l i o n ) approved in M a r c h 1998 after almost five years w i t h o u t IDA lending.45 During these 
years, IDA p rov ided o n l y 1 to 2 percent o f to ta l a id disbursements. Moreover, W o r l d Bank Group 
assistance was res tr ic ted t o IDA, g iven that the coun try was n o t a member o f I F C o r M IGA . 

7. 
The C A S iden t i f ied several, long- term challenges faced by Bhutan, w h i c h rema in relevant f o r 
Bank assistance: Investments in hydropower sector development have he lped accelerate economic g row th 
and social and human development, w h i l e increasing re l iance o n a single-market / single-commodity 
export. In addition, g iven i t s characteristics, power sector g row th was n o t resu l t ing in substantial j o b 
generation. Government employment stopped expanding, but the sma l l and underdeveloped pr iva te sector 
remains unable to p rov ide opportunities fo r the g r ow i n g labor force, pa r t icu la r ly the educated youth. N o t 
on ly i s t h e coun try landlocked, bu t i t s small popu la t ion i s spread over a d i f f i c u l t , moun ta inous terra in that 
makes access t o markets, technology, and services essential t o development efforts, and imp rov ing access 
t o the g loba l economy and in terna l ly challenging. P rov is ion o f services i s generally cos t ly as economies 
o f scale are d i f f i c u l t to achieve. A l t h o u g h RG oB has good know ledge o f the cond i t ions and development 
needs across the country, na t iona l capacity fo r economic, demographic, and pove r ty data co l lec t ion and 
analysis has been weak, cons tra in ing p o l i c y design and m o n i t o r i n g and eva lua t ion (M&E) o f development 
results, par t icu lar ly o f the Millennium Deve lopmen t Goa ls (MDGs). 

8. 
The C A S also noted concern w i t h some signs of “Du tch disease” syndrome suffered by the 
coun try . This was seemingly due t o the substantial i n f l ow o f fo re ign a id and o f fore ign resources 
or ig ina ted by hydroe lec tr ic power exports, and t o the constraints o f the exchange rate, as the Bhutanese 

4 5 IDA commitments before 1998 amounted to US$28 million. The last credit f o r Bhutan before FY98 was the Third Forestry 
Development Project (US65 .4 million), approved on July 6, 1993.

result, the r e a l exchange tended to appreciate, making imports more attractive than expor ts and wages o f

Bhutan’s Long-Term Development Goals and Results 

9. 
The FYOO CAS was aligned w i t h Bhutan’s unique v is ion o f increasing Gross N a t i o n a l Happiness 
through a balanced and equitable development pa th that pr iv i leges happiness and satisfaction o f the 
popu la t ion over economic growth. This p r inc ip le has guided Bhutan’s e f for ts f o r the last two decades, and 
was further articulated in 1999 in the document Bhutan 2020: A Vision fo r Peace, Prosperity and 
Happiness, and i t s underpinning strategy implemented during the CAS pe r iod through t h e 8FYP, and 
curren t ly under the Ninth Five-year P lan (9FYP), w h i c h constitutes the basis f o r the country’s Pover ty 
Reduc t ion Strategy Paper (PRSP). Impor tan t ly , the 9FYP i s based o n a consultative process that t o o k over 
tw o years, and inc luded stakeholders f r om the na t iona l to t h e b l o c k (geog) l e v e l . 

10. 
To achieve i t s development vision, Bhu tan has adopted f o u r p i l la rs : econom ic g row th and 
development, p romo t ion and preservation o f cu l tura l heritage, sustainable use o f the environment, and 
good governance. The long- term strategic goals underp inn ing these pillars inc lude ma in ta in ing sound 
macroeconomic po l icy , ensuring good governance (especially by p romo t ing decentralization), expanding 
physical infrastructure ( inc lud ing roads, electricity, and telecommunications), and im p r o v i n g access to 
social services (p r inc ipa l ly schools and health facilities). As re f lec ted in the FYOO CAS, Bhutan has clear 
medium- t o long- term social and human development targets. The targets in the Eighth and Ninth Plans 
are consistent with these long- term goals, and under the 9FYPPRSP, l i n k e d t o the M i l l e n n i um 
Development Goals (MDGs). 

1 1. 
Bhutan con t inued to made good progress towards these goals during the CAS period, although i t 
i s no t easy to p rov ide re l iab le estimates due to uncertainty o n the number o f to ta l popu la t ion and other 
data and capacity  constraint^.^' Substantial progress has certainly been made in g ross school enro l lmen t 
rates (about 81 percent in 2003) and gender pa r i ty (girls represented 46 percent o f school enrollments in 
2001). C h i l d mo r ta l i ty has decreased by about h a l f over the last two decades. T h e R o y a l Government, 
however, wou ld l i k e t o see faster progress in pover ty reduction, since i t i s estimated tha t about a third o f 
the to ta l popu la t ion i s poor (based o n a p re l im ina ry pover ty line), with mos t o f the p o o r living in the ru ra l 
areas. Moreover, inequa l i ty i s re la t ive ly high (Gini coe f f ic ien t o f 0.42 in 2003). The coun try has an 
excellent record on env ironmen ta l management, although i t i s fac ing increas ing pressure due t o scarcity 
o f arable land and urbanization. An add i t iona l challenge i s the unresolved issue o f c i t izensh ip c la ims o f 
refugees l i v i n g i n Nepa l . The R o y a l Government i s nevertheless fully comm i t ted t o finding a humane 
so lu t ion to this issue. 

C . 

CAS Outcomes 

12. 
The strategic goa l o f the FYOO CAS was t o assist Bhutan, in partnership with other donors, in 
rea l iz ing i ts . development v is ion by helping t o ensure that rap id economic g row th resulted in inc lus ive 

46 Bank analysis conducted in 2003 indicated that Bhutan had avoided the “Dutch disease” syndrome. However, OED 
recommended that this issue be revisited in l igh t o f recent export trends and urban poverty values. I t should also be noted that, 
according to the Fund’s 2005 Article I V Report, despite the booming power sector, there has not been clear evidence o f Dutch 
disease thus far. 
The f i rs t Population and Housing Census, following UN recommendations, should t a k e place soon. A major limitation 
regarding poverty analysis i s that the country does not have an official poverty line.

soc ia l transformation and poverty reduction. To meet this goal, t h e CAS recognized t h e pillars and long- 
term development outcomes relevant to the country’s vision. The CAS, however, was not explicitly a 
results-based document, focusing on the inputs and processes rather than on the outcomes toward which 
Bank assistance was to contribute during the CAS period. As was generally the case across the Bank, 
monitoring progress o f CAS implementation and impact on the ground were not sufficiently emphasized. 

13 . 

Nevertheless, according to the priorities described in the CAS, the Bank expected t o assist Bhutan 
in macroeconomic policy and public expenditure management, education sector development, health 
sector development, particularly through HIV/AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) 
prevention and treatment, rural access (mainly roads), urban development, and forestry management. 
Although the CAS noted the shortcomings o f the private sector, it did no t include any explicit support in 
this area. Progress made in the priority areas, which have been retrofitted as “CAS outcomes” for this 
assessment, and Bank contribution to achieving these outcomes, are discussed below after an overview o f 
CAS design and implementation issues.48 See Table A fo r h r t h e r details on CAS outcomes. 

CAS Design and Implementation Issues 

14. 
Under the assumption that the Bank would continue to play a limited lending role i n Bhutan, the 
CAS emphasized selectivity and the Bank’s comparative advantage in transferring knowledge and ideas 
to Bhutan rather than finance. This “knowledge transfer first, then lending” approach was supported at the 
time by RGoB and i t s fiscal and debt management policies. I n close partnership with RGoB, such 
emphasis was also expected to help fill up information and knowledge gaps resulting from the Bank’s 
limited past involvement in the country, particularly in such critical areas as growth, poverty, and public 
expenditure. Accordingly, the CAS envisioned to place the Bank’s knowledge resources at the country’s 
disposal without necessarily linking them to ID A credits, and included an open-ended l i s t o f Analytical 
and Advisory Activities (AAA) to be carried out as needed by the government. Although no further 
credits besides the two approved in FYOO were listed in the CAS, financing for priority poverty-reduction 
areas o f human development and infrastructure - particularly i n education and forestry - was to be 
considered if requested by RGoB, following a standard project approach. In addition, t h e CAS mentioned 
the possibility o f broad-based budget support credits, depending on country conditions and government 
demand. 

15 . 

Becoming a knowledge bank proved difficult, particularly s ince government demand for non- 
lending services did not reach the expected levels. As a result, Bhutan did not fu l ly benefit from the 
knowledge resources available at the Bank, and many o f the information and knowledge gaps identified in 
the CAS document s t i l l remain. The Bank faced constraints due to i t s limited engagement and resources. 
This situation was further exacerbated by the fact that government counterparts were no t always aware, 
nor made sufficiently aware o f what the Bank has to offer, particularly as it related to the benefits o f some 
o f the AAA suggested by the Bank. A t the same time, there were resources, usually grant funding, made 
available to RGoB from other donors. Due to i t s limited capacity, RGoB was also cautious about 
engaging in too many analytical activities with too many donors. 

16. 
Despite the intention o f emphasizing non-lending services, almost 60 percent o f total IDA lending 
to Bhutan has taken place after the Board discussion o f the FYOO CAS. T h i s trend, it should be 
emphasized, emerged as the Bank adjusted i t s strategy to changing circumstances under the 9FYP / 
PRSP. When 9FYP implementation started in July 2002 (FY03), RGoB was facing a substantial financial 
gap due to ambitious targets coupled with l e s s than expected external assistance from development 

4 8 Measuring progress was limited by the lack o f baseline and recent data, and t h e d i f f icu l ty in observing significant changes i n 
some o f the outcomes during the CAS period. Establishing with confidence direct cause and e f f e c t between the Bank’s 
contribution and a specific outcome was also challenging given the relative small size o f the country program vis-&-vis 
development needs, the presence o f many other actors, and t h e influence o f exogenous factors.

partners, A t the time, after three f isca l years w i thou t borrowing, RG o B expressed renewed interest in 
accessing a l l o f the coun try ’s IDA allocation. Up to this point, the B a n k had tacitly accepted t o p lay a 
secondary role, while U N D P and ADB were the leading mu l t i la te ra l agencies in the coun t ry . Responding 
to the country’s request, the B a n k prov ided US$36.7 m i l l i o n in f inanc ia l assistance in FY04 , b r ing ing 
to ta l IDA comm i tmen ts to U S $ l O l m i l l i o n . In FYOS, w i t h the approval in M a r c h 2005 o f the 
Decentralized R u r a l Development Pro jec t (US$7.0 m i l l ion) , Bhutan exhausted i t s IDA a l loca t ion f o r the 
f i r s t t ime .49 

17 . 
The CAS per iod was no t iona l ly set until F Y 0 2 t o a l low the B a n k t o adjust i t s strategy t o the 
9FYP I PRSP. A l t h o u g h comp le t ion o f the agreed PRSP cover note t o o k longer than anticipated, the Bank 
should have prepared a CAS Progress Report t o respond t o the evo lv ing circumstances. Nonetheless, 
although not forma l ized , a sh i f t in strategy has taken place. The emerg ing strategy recognizes the above 
constraints, and attempts t o balance lend ing w i t h non- lend ing services, pa r t icu la r ly just-in-time analysis 
and technical assistance more sensitive to capacity constraints. Through i t s lending, the Bank has

CAS Outcomes: P rog ress and B a n k C o n t r i b u t i o n 

1 8. 
I m p r o v i n g M a c r o e c o n om i c P o l i c y and P u b l i c E x p e n d i t u r e M a n a g em e n t . Underp inned by 
sound macroeconomic management, Bhu tan enjoyed du r ing the C A S per iod an average annual g row th o f 
6 .5 percent and l o w in f la t ion . A l though i t has become increasingly d i f f icu l t , f o r the mos t par t the R o y a l 
Government has f o l l ow e d i t s p o l i c y o f f inanc ing recurrent expenditures f r om domestic revenue and 
cap i ta l investments through external f inanc ing and spec i f ica l ly grants. M o r e progress i s requ ired on 
budget preparation and pub l ic expenditure management, areas where the B a n k expected t o contribute 
more substantially than it did. However, engagement in these areas has been successfully started recently 
through prov is ion o f technical assistance. As par t o f this effort, the R G o B prepared a p re l im ina ry Medium 
Te rm F isca l Framework (MTFF ) as a first step towards mak ing mu l t i-year r o l l i n g budgets operational. 

19. 
S u p p o r t i n g E d u c a t i o n Sec tor Deve lopmen t . Bhutan has made excellent progress in im p r o v i n g 
access and qua l i ty o f education. In the last f i v e years alone, ove ra l l enro l lmen t at a l l leve ls o f education 
(primary, secondary, and tertiary) has increased near ly 50 percent. In p r ima ry education, according t o the 
M i n i s t r y o f Education, gross p r ima ry enro l lmen t reached 84.2 percent in 2003, a substantial increase f r om 
1991, when it was 5 5 percent.” Girls’ enrollment r a t i o also improved, increasing f r om 39 percent in 1990 
to 47 percent i n 2003. The country’s successful e f for ts in education have been supported consistently by 
the Bank, in partnership w i t h the Swiss Deve lopmen t Corpora t ion (SDC). 

20. 
I n line w i t h the CAS, the B a n k continued t o be one o f the largest donors in this sector between 
FYOO and FY05. W h i l e the second IDA - f i n a n c e d education pro jec t (US$13.7 m i l l i o n ) was s t i l l be ing 
implemented, the B a n k approved in August 2003 the Educa t ion Deve lopmen t P ro jec t (US$3 1 m i l l ion) , 
w h i c h constitutes about one- th ird o f to ta l IDA lending t o the coun try . Through these projects, the Bank 
has helped finance cap i ta l investments, par t icu lar ly cons truc t ion o f p r im a r y and j u n i o r high schools. At 
the same time, the Bank has con tr ibu ted t o other education improvements b y suppor t ing in-service 
teacher training, continuous assessments, and improved learn ing processes. Unde r EDP, the Bank i s also 
supporting the i n i t i a l e f for ts to promo te h igher education, i n c l u d i n g the establishment o f a na t iona l 
un ivers i ty system. 

49 Due to IDA 13 constraints, the Bank could not actually meet in full Bhutan’s request for financial assistance in FY05. 
GER in primary education i s estimated at 93 percent in the BLSS (2003).

21. 
Strengthening Hea l th Sector through H IV /A IDS and S T I Prevention and Treatment. Over 
the past two decades, Bhutan has made remarkable progress in improving the health status o f its 
population. From 1984 to 2000, infant mortality has declined from 102.8 deaths per 1000 l ive births to 
60.5 i n 2000, and under-five mortality from 162.4 to 84. Furthermore, maternal mortality has seen a 
considerable decrease, w i th the ratio declining from 7.7 per 1000 l ive births to 2.6. Control o f 
communicable diseases has also seen significant successes - at present, prevalence o f leprosy remains 
low, TB cure r a t e high at 90 percent, and polio not reported s ince 1986. Bhutan, however, faces emerging 
problems and issues in the health sector, such as increase in the burden o f non-communicable diseases 
and the spread o f H IV /A IDS . In t h i s respect, the 9FYP / PRSP identified H IV /A IDS and STD prevention 
and control as one o f the country’s most important programs within the overall objective o f addressing 
emerging health issues o f the population at large, and of promoting healthy outcomes o f women and 
adolescents. 

22. 
Responding to the priorities o f the 9FYP / PRSP, the Bank commenced support to the sector w i th 
the Board approval in June 2004 o f the H IV IA IDS and STI Prevention Project, financed w i th an I D A 
grant o f US$5 .8 m i l l ion . This assistance complements the larger support from the Government o f India 
(GoI) and DAN IDA , which are the largest donors in the health sector, and i s contributing to the overall 
expansion o f health infrastructure and services in Bhutan. Through the IDA-financed project, the Bank i s 
helping implement prevention interventions, including STI treatment, providing antiretroviral therapy to 
people l iv ing w i th H IV IA IDS , strengthening the Public Health Laboratory and the Blood Bank, 
enhancing the capacity o f the Dzongkhags to manage and implement prevention and care programs, and 
improving the information base through surveillance and monitoring and evaluation (M&E). 

2 3 . 
Imp rov ing Fores try Management. The Bank has supported Bhutan’s efforts to develop an 
approach for sustainable protection, management, and use o f its forestry resources since the mid-l980s, in 
partnership w i th SDC, mainly through lending, and more recently, an institutional development facility 
(IDF) grant to implement the Forestry Institutional Development Initiative. Consistent w i th i t s concern 
with environmental protection, Bhutan has carefully managed the commercial exploitation o f its forest 
resources. During the CAS period, t h e country’s forest area actually increased, reaching about 7 2 percent 
o f the country’s territory. Social forestry, piloted w i th I D A support during the CAS period, has been 
mainstreamed under the 9FYP. The IDF grant helped promote the organization o f the private sector under 
the Wood-based Industries Association. 

24. 
In contrast, as noted by OED, the Bank has not contributed as much as envisaged to help move 
forward the national reform agenda o f the forestry sector. This limited r e s u l t appears to have been 
affected by the sub-national focus o f the three projects so far supported by I D A and inadequate attention 
t o some aspects o f the policy dialogue. Further progress i s critical since Bhutan faces the challenge o f 
achieving and maintaining the delicate balance between conserving i t s forestry resources and tapping into 
their economic potential, particularly given the need for economic diversification. 

25 . 

After the third IDA-financed forestry project was completed at the end o f FY02, RGoB decided 
not to continue seeking forestry sector-specific support from the Bank. A more integrated, cross-sectoral 
approach i s sought through the renewable natural resources management plan included in the 9FYP. 
Although no formal sector work has been conducted recently, the Bank completed an informal review. 
The findings from the latter, however, have not been disseminated. 

26. 
Supporting U r b a n Development. Urbanization i s taking place rapidly in Bhutan, and the two 
main c i t i e s - Thimphu and Phuentsholing - are growing fast. In this respect, t h e Bank agreed to support 
the Royal Government’s efforts to promote decentralization and ensure balanced regional development by 
helping finance infrastructure improvement in 10 towns, including provision o f water supply and solid 
waste management. While Bank assistance i s contributing the promotion o f a more balanced urban 

56

growth, th is i s a ma jo r challenge that requires a clearer na t iona l strategy and po l icy , in add i t ion t o further 
investments. A m a j o r challenge has been t o ensure sustainability o f outcomes der ived f r om Bank support 
through adequate operation and maintenance (O&M). However, u s e r charges f o r in fras truc ture services 
are being in troduced f o r the f i r s t t ime in most o f the targeted towns, w h i c h w i l l help set up more 
sustainable O&M arrangements. 

27. 

Improving Rurai Access . Road access i s c r i t ica l t o pove r ty and deve lopmen t in Bhutan. The 
d i f f i c u l t terrain, 
the scattered population, and strong env ironmen ta l p o l i c y make expansion and 
maintenance o f the road ne twork challenging. During the C A S period, and f o r the f i r s t time, the B a n k 
contributed to im p r o v i n g access and reducing transport costs b y h e l p i n g finance n ew ru ra l access roads. 
The ongoing project, w i t h co- f inanc ing f r om the Netherlands, i s expected t o bene f i t abou t 25,000 people. 
I n addition, this e f f o r t helped promo te environmentally friendly road cons truc t ion (EFC) techniques that 
are now applied t o a l l feeder roads in the country. M o r e specifically, a recen t ly comp le ted socioeconomic 
impact assessment o f the ongo ing project shows that s ign i f ican t economic and soc ia l benefits have 
already been realized as a result o f the Bank-financed roads. Some re levan t ind ica tors are: (a) trans i t ion 
f r om por tag ing and an ima l transport t o mo tor ized transport, resulting in a s ign i f ican t reduc t ion in trave l 
t ime and transportation costs. In Dakpa i -Bhu l i road, f o r example, trave l time was decreased f r om two 
days to tw o hours and transport cost o n key commodities reduced by 40 t o 60 percen t after the road was 
open; (b) d ive rs i f ica t ion o f agr icu l tura l products, f r om mos t ly cereal and r ice p roduc t ion t o potato, 
vegetables, and fruits; (c) imp roved access to better health care, especially in the u s e o f emergency 
vehicles (ambulances) and evacuation o f sick people t o adequate healthcare fac i l i t ies ; and (d) increase in 
roadside shops and p romo t ion o f new income-generating oppor tun i t ies . 

Ove ra l l Assessment o f Coun try P r o u a m Performance 

28. 

In line with OED ’s assessment, the overa l l outcome o f B a n k assistance i s considered moderately 
satisfactory. I n general, Bank impac t cou ld no t be expected to be substantial g iven the l im i t e d ro le o f IDA 
in Bhutan. Impact, however, varies across areas and sectors. The B a n k responded in a timely manner t o 
the Roya l Government’s request f o r assistance t o deal w i t h HIV/AIDS. As such, p o l i c y advice and the 
ava i lab i l i ty o f IDA grant funding translated in to concrete e f for ts t o scale u p the response t o H I V / A I D S in 
t h e country, and progress i s be ing made toward the outcomes supported by the IDA - f i n a n c e d operation. 
Wh i le in education the Bank i s l i k e l y to have had a substantial impact, i t s impac t in forestry i s more 
modest and w i t h mo re m i x e d results. The Bank has con tr ibu ted t o h e l p i n g imp rove fores t management in 
general, and to p romo t ing commun i ty invo lvemen t in forest pro tec t ion and exp lo i ta t ion . O n the other 
hand, the Bank-supported e f f o r t t o introduce f inanc ia l ly self-sustaining fores try in B h u t a n did no t produce 
the expected results. This, however, was pa r t ia l ly due t o changed marke t cond i t ions after RG oB banned 
the export o f unprocessed logs and semi-finished products in 1999 and 2000, respec t ive ly . Bank analysis 
and advice on fores try p r i c i n g and marketing, although sound, had l i t t l e impac t on po l icy . The Bank 
started to support urban development in FYOO, and impacts o n this area w i l l soon be v is ib le . Some 
inroads were made in suppor t ing pr iva te sector development th rough ana ly t ica l services, inc lud ing the 
Private Sector Survey (2002), w h i c h prov ided inputs f o r the 9FYP/PRSP, and FIAS’ support t o develop 
fore ign direct investment (FD I ) legislation. I F C and SEDF, created to p rov ide support t o sma l l and 
med ium enterprise development, have been quite active since Bhu tan became a member o f I F C in 
December 2003, bu t i s s t i l l ear ly t o see measurable r e s u l t s f r om the i r ac t iv i t ies .

P o r t f o l i o Assessment 

2 9 . 
A l though the FYOO C A S d i d no t inc lude a specific lend ing program, l e n d i n g du r ing the CAS 
period was re la t ive ly substantial in response t o the evo lv ing needs o f the coun t ry (see Table B). Despite 

Attachment 6: CAS Comp le t ion Report

57 

the increase i n n e t commitments, I D A remained a relatively small player in Bhutan: as o f March 2005, 
total I D A net commitments amounted to US$80 m i l l ion and undisbursed funds to U S $ 5 8 m i l l ion . During 
the CAS period, financial assistance was provided in two “batches” supporting activities under the 8FYP 
and 9FYP / PRSP, respectively. As agreed during CAS formulation, two projects were approved in FYOO: 
Urban Development (US10 .8 million) and Rural Access (US$l 1.6 million). Due to the circumstances 
noted above, two projects were approved in FY04: Education Development (US$3 1 million), the largest 
credit ever given to Bhutan, and H IV /A IDS and STI Prevention (US$5.7 million, IDA Grant). A new 
credit for US$7.0 m i l l ion to support decentralized rural development was approved in March 2005. In 
addition, IFC approved an investment loan for US$lO m i l l ion i n December 2003, soon a f t e r Bhutan 
became an IFC member. The Bank also provided several Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grants to 
help strengthen forestry sec tor institutions, financial management and accounting capacity o f government 
officials, and the pension system. 

30 . 
The small size o f the portfolio (3 to 4 active projects on average) makes some o f the indicators 
used by the Bank to monitor and assess portfolio performance d i f f icu l t to apply in Bhutan’s case. Simply 
put, every project counts in Bhutan. This i s best exemplified in the “country record flag” added to the 
portfolio by QAG i n January 2004 given that the net disconnect and unsatisfactory commitments in 
Bhutan exceeded QAG established t h r e ~ h o l d . ~ ’ Bhutan’s figures for both indicators, however, reflect the 
fac t that the .only project (Third Forestry Project, US$5.2 m i l l ion) o f the country por t fo l io that has closed 
i n the past f ive years was given a moderately unsatisfactory rating on project outcome by OED, while in 
the last PSR, the supervision team gave i t a marginally satisfactory rating. As a resu l t , the portfolio ended 
up in FY02 w i th 100 percent of projects existing w i th unsatisfactory outcome and 100 percent disconnect, 
and by extension w i th 100 percent o f commitments under unsatisfactory projects in the last five years. 

3 I. In general, portfolio risk indicators remained close to and were occasionally better than regional 
and Bank averages. I n FY03, however, the Urban Development Project became a “problem project” for 
several months due to unsatisfactory implementation progress. Since the portfolio was comprised o f three 
projects at the time, this meant that over a third o f the portfolio was at risk. 

32 . 
The annual disbursement ratio was always close to or above 20 percent, but this aggregate figure 
hides differences in disbursement performance at the project level. Reflecting increased commitments, 
annual average disbursements increased substantially during the CAS period. Specifically, from an annual 
average o f US$1.2 m i l l ion (or about US1.8 per capita) during the 1990s, gross disbursements rose to 
US$5.3 m i l l ion (almost US7.0 per capita) between FY00-04. In fact, FY04 i s a record year w i th gross 
disbursements o f U S $ 8 . 1 m i l l ion and a disbursement ratio o f 3 9 percent. On the other hand, several 
projects suffered from a slow disbursement pace. In the case o f Rural Access Roads and Urban 
Development in particular, barely 45 o f credit funds were disbursed during four years o f implementation. 
The disbursement pace of these projects has improved, and the closing date o f Rural Access Roads 
extended to ensure achievement o f development objectives. 

3 3 . 

As shown in Table C, the delivery o f non-lending services was limited compared to the high 
expectations imp l ic i t in the CAS, but the Bank provided some u s e f u l advice and informal analysis on 
several key issues. Two formal reports were completed in FY02, including a Private Sector Survey in 
collaboration with UNDP and the Bhutan Chamber o f Commerce and Industry (BCCI), and the Country 
Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) w i th support from the Government o f Netherlands. Other 
AAA envisaged in the CAS was completed by other agencies @e., the Poverty Analysis and the Financial 
Sector Study, both o f which were completed by ADB) or started later than expected (Public Expenditure 

According to QAG, a country record flag i s given when a portfolio experiences a net disconnect o f 20 percent or more, or 
when net commitments associated w i th unsatisfactory projects (as rated by OED) represent more than 40 percent o f 
commitments for completed projects over the previous five yea rs .

rate regime, recurrent costs and budgetary methods, and c i v i l aviation, and i s c om p l e t i n g an M D G

e f f ic ien t . 

Quality o f Products and Serv ices 

3 5 . 

For the most part, IDA - f i n a n c e d projects i n Bhutan have had a sa t is fac tory outcome, and 
contributed to ins t i tu t iona l development, even though sustainability o f p ro jec t b e n e f i t s has n o t always 
been certain.52 In addition, accord ing to OED, the lend ing program in Bhu tan has been c l ien t-dr iven and 
respectful o f the coun try ’s development v is ion and cu l tura l values. M o s t pro jec ts h a v e been supported 
through an e f fec t ive co l labora t ion with other development partners, w h i c h a l lowed t h e government to 
max im ize IDA f inanc ing f o r phys ica l infrastructure and use o f grant funding f o r t h e necessary technical 
assistance. 

3 6 . 

A ma jo r factor a f fec t ing pro jec t outcomes was weak pro jec t imp lemen ta t ion . T h e latter, however, 
i s no t on ly the r e s u l t o f coun try capacity constraints and specific geographic and m a r k e t circumstances, 
but also weak Bank supervision, and in some cases, inadequate pro jec t design. In general, the Bank was, 
and s t i l l i s constrained by not h a v i n g a loca l o f f i c e in the country and the d i f f i c u l t y in building a cohesive 
Country Team. M o r e spec i f ica l ly , the sma l l size o f the program made it d i f f i c u l t t o ensure s ta f f con t inu i ty 
and focused attention o f management, and b y extension, t o build a cohesive coun try team . Moreover, the 
geography o f the coun try demands t ime and resources no t o f ten ava i lab le t o the Bank t o ensure even 
supervision across pro jec t sites. At the same time, the coun try p rog ram did n o t have a dedicated 
operations adviser until very recen t ly and an in-coun try and in-depth p o r t f o l i o per formance rev iew has 
never been conducted. 

3 7 . 

Overa l l pro jec t delays also re f lec t l im i t e d capacity o f government, espec ia l ly at the loca l level, 
and o f pr iva te sector contractors. Moreover, scarcity o f loca l t rad i t iona l cons t ruc t ion materials a n d o r 
labor often resulted in cons truc t ion delays.53 The s i tua t ion was made mo re c r i t i c a l b y the Roya l 
Government’s concern with add ing s ta f f i n l i n e m i n i s t r i e s and agencies, even as consultants, to cope with 
the increased demand f o r design and supervision o f c i v i l w0rks.5~ I n addition, s t a f f transfers occurred 
frequently, w h i l e c i v i l service ru les have tended t o delay the f i l l i n g up o f pro jec t-re la ted positions. N o t 
surprisingly, a l l projects under imp lemen ta t ion during the C A S per iod su f fered imp lemen ta t ion delays, 
and project c los ing dates extended in several cases. 

3 8 . 

Weak capacity also a f fec ted m o n i t o r i n g and evaluation (M&E) o f p ro jec t outcomes, although the 
recen t project in education re f lec ts an increased e f f o r t to strengthen this impor tan t area. Imp lemen t ing the 

5 2 As noted above, the only project completed during the CAS period - the Third Forestry Project - was rated by OED as having 
a moderately unsatisfactory outcome, i n addition to having modest institutional development impact and uncertain 
sustainability. 
5 3 I n this respect, the new education project i s helping to introduce a new building technique that w i l l accelerate construction 
while maintaining the traditional details o f schools. 
5 4 This concern i s also related to the long standing policy o f using I D A financing for capital investments, and grants for technical 
assistance. 

Attachment 6: C A S Comp le t ion Report

59 

M&E systems envisaged in the Bank-financed projects was, and remains, challenging, especially given 
the scarcity o f baseline data and need for increased data analysis and impact evaluation capacity. 

3 9 . 
Under t h e above circumstances, OED correctly identifies on the part o f the Bank some 
“insensitivity to size” regarding project requirements. As i n other countries, Bhutan’s small c iv i l service 
could not easily cope with Bank requirements, especially fo r reporting, financial management, and 
procurement. I t did not help, moreover, that quality o f Bank supervision was uneven, partialIy due, as 
mentioned above, to the high turnover o f project teams and task managers, but also because o f the 
difficulty in visiting a l l project s i t e s and in following up on critical issues.55 I n turn, limited government 
capacity and weak supervision have affected (i) quality control o f c iv i l works, which i s critical 
considering that local contractors are also limited in their s k i l l s , and (ii) sustainability o f operation and 
maintenance (O&M) arrangements. 

40. 
The quality o f AAA i n Bhutan i s difficult to assess due to the very small samples analyzed by 
QAG or OED. I n general, although limited in its impact at the level o f government policy, OED agrees 
that the Bank’s Economic and Sector Work (ESW) in Bhutan has been effective in several respects. These 
include helping inform Bank management and development partners on country issues, and helping to 
make strategic decisions on Bank assistance. The main weakness i n t e rm s o f ESW, according t o OED, i s 
the lack o f formal sector work to inform Bank lending and policy dialogue. Knowledge in such sectors as 
the private sector, transport, education, and forestry was nevertheless deepened during CAS 
implementation. In the case o f education in particular, sector knowledge has been accumulated through 
project-financed studies. 

Country Dialogue and A id Coordination 

41. 
The FYOO CAS was prepared following an adequate level o f consultations with Government and 
c i v i l society in Thimphu and rural areas, including country team staff from different sectors. I n addition, 
tw o extensive field visits were conducted by Bank anthropologists to understand be t te r the social and 
ethnic context o f Bhutan. As noted earlier, development planning in Bhutan follows a highly participatory 
process, which facilitates the identification o f needs and priorities o f different stakeholders. 

42. 
During the CAS period, RGoB continued to coordinate external technical and financial 
assistance, based on i t s sense o f development priorities and o f the comparative advantage o f i t s 
development partners. To keep coordination efforts manageable, particularly given the small s ize o f the 
c iv i l service, the Royal Government has endeavored to l im i t the overall number o f donors in the country 
and in individual sectors. I n this respect, it has organized, with help from UNDP, e igh t roundtable 
meetings with development partners. Two o f these meetings were held during CAS implementation: In 
November 2000 in Thimphu and in February 2003 in Geneva. The latter was particularly relevant, since 
it provided RGoB and donors with the opportunity to review the progress made during the 8FYP and to 
discuss the development priorities and financing requirements o f the 9FYP. UNDP, at the same time, 
facilitates coordination by holding meetings among donors resident in Thimphu, and when requested, 
meetings of concerned donors with missions o f non-resident multilateral agencies such as the Bank. 

43. 
The Bank coordinated i t s efforts by working with development partners and following the 
division o f labor promoted by RGoB. Accordingly, I D A supported capital investments while the 
concerned development partners - SDC, t h e Netherlands, and Helvetas from Switzerland i n particular - 

For instance; the Third Forestry Project had six different Task Managers, the Urban Development has been managed by three 
so far, and the Education Development Project had three during project preparation and has had two since implementation 
started.

provided grants, mainly for technical assistance and other “soft” components and a ~ t i v i t i e s . ~ ~ 
I n some 
cases, however, the Bank did not acknowledge the role o f i t s development partners appropriately or pay 
sufficient attention to their concerns during project implementation. In general, although Bank relations 
with other donors are generally positive, t h e Bank did not always keep donors informed o f strategic 
decisions that concerned them. Moreover, the Bank should have had a closer dialogue w i th ADB, which 
has a very active involvement in the country, and the Government o f India - the largest single donor. 

E. 

M a i n Lessons f o r New CAS Design and Implementation 

44. 

The lessons discussed i n this section and Table A are consistent w i th the Country Assistance 
Evaluation (CAE) completed by OED i n June 2004 and direct stakeholder feedback. I t i s generally agreed 
that Bhutan has made substantial social and economic progress fo l low ing i t s distinct development 
approach. I t i s also c lear that country ownership o f the development agenda has contributed to this 
progress and that the Bank, in close collaboration with development partners, should continue to support 
this agenda and i t s underlying principles. On the other hand, as a relatively small player in a small 
country, the Bank finds i t s e l f i n a challenging position i n Bhutan, particularly considering the increasing 
need expressed by RGoB for techn ica l and financial assistance. 

45 . 
To respond effectively, the new CAS w i l l need to emphasize flexibility, selectivity, partnerships 
with other donors, and an intense dialogue w i th government. These principles were imp l ic i t i n the FYOO 
CAS, although not always closely followed. Increased sensitivity to the constraints faced by Bhutan 
regarding Bank requirements, which should be reflected in reliance on country systems coupled w i th 
capacity building without diluting fiduciary obligations, w i l l be critical to facilitate achievement o f CAS 
outcomes. Adapting to small country constraints should be facilitated by ongoing Bank-wide changes 
related to the new approach to policy-based lending, simplification o f the investment lending process, and 
harmonization efforts. 

46. 
F lex ib i l i ty is c r i t ica l to respond to evolving c l ien t demands, but i t should be balanced through 
selectivity and a clear recognition of 
the l im i ted IDA and Bank staff resources ava i lab le to deliver 
assistance to Bhutan. Respectively, the Bank should l im i t its engagement to a few areas, sectors and 
programs. This strategic decision w i l l help enhance development impact, as demonstrated by the results 
achieved through the continued engagement i n the education sector.

I t is c r i t ica l to avo id supply-driven assistance, pa r t icu la r ly non-lending services that are 
considered “mandatory” by the Bank but its usefilness is not f i l l y understood o r accepted by the 

g o v e r nm e n t . Go ing forward, t h e Bank should undertake a concerted e f f o r t to make government 

counterparts fu l ly aware o f what it has to offer regarding non-lending services, as well as o f the 
usefulness and potential benefits o f certain B a n k products. In general, the approach to A A A should be 
low key and relatively informal and cognizant o f capacity constraints, while giving non-lending technical 
assistance a’more programmatic and prominent role. Simultaneously, as pointed out by OED, the Bank 
should deepen i t s knowledge o f those sectors where it plans to become engaged during CAS 
implementation. Overall, the Bank should endeavor to integrate better A A A with lending and technical 
assistance to enhance its impact, while making A A A more collaborative by engaging government 
counterparts in preparation and dissemination and exploiting opportunities for donor collaboration. 
Increased policy advice and analysis, through demand-driven work and sustained dialogue, i s a specific 
area that would help enhance the Bank’s development effectiveness in Bhutan. 

5 6 The Bank d id not succeed in partnering w i th Helvetas in the financing o f the Education Development Program due to delays i n 
project preparation.

The recent f luc tua t ions and emerging trend of reduced frows i n external f inanc ing upon wh ich 
Bhutan relies heavily indicate the need for stronger donor coord ina t ion . The B a n k does n o t necessarily 
need to take the lead in a l l the sectors it agrees to support, and should be w i l l i n g t o p l a y a complementary 
ro le whenever possible. Co - f inanc ing has been used successfully in the past and shou ld be encouraged 
dur ing CAS imp lemen ta t ion . As previous experience shows, co- f inanc ing - and o ther types o f f inanc ia l 
arrangements among a group o f development partners and the government - enhances coordination, 
brings i n add i t iona l expertise, and strengthens supervision. 

49. 
The above conclusions ind ica te that i t i s advisable to (a) have annual discussions o n the country 
program t o ensure adequate response t o changing circumstances; (b) ma in ta in an open-ended A A A 
program, supported by unallocated funds t o respond t o government request fo r p o l i c y and analytical 
advice i n a timely fashion; (c) strengthen commun ica t ion with development partners, and ma in ta in c l o s e 
contact w i t h those that have a f ie ld presence; and (d) to develop a clear strategic approach t o co-financing 
or other moda l i t ies o f donor support that a l l ow max imum leverage o f techn ica l and f inanc ia l resources. 

50. 
A ma jo r challenge f o r Bhu tan i s t o measure development results, espec ia l ly given the lack o f 
reliable data and the need to b u i l d in coun try capacity f o r M&E. A tremendous e f f o r t l ies ahead for the 
government, especially after the census o f popu la t ion i s completed. At b o t h coun t ry program and project 
levels, the Bank needs t o improve e f for ts t o measure resu l ts through better M&E systems, emphasizing 
outcomes rather than inpu ts and processes, and ensuring adequate funding to imp lemen t these systems.

Local Costfinancing. Are the 

requirements for Bank financing o f

that: (i) financing requirements for 
the country’s development 
program would exceed the public 
sector’s own resources (e.g., from 
taxation and other revenues) and 
expected domestic borrowing; and 
(ii) the financing o f foreign 
expenditures alone would not 
enable the Bank t o ass is t in the 
financing o f individual projects. 
Taxes and duties. Are there any 
taxes and duties that the bank 
would not finance? 

Yes 

N o n e 

RemarksiExplanation 
In individual projects, funding from government 
3r from other sources w i l l be generally 
encouraged, in order to leverage Bank resources 
and take advantage o f partnership opportunities. 
The Bank may finance 100 percent o f a l l project 
I program costs where needed and appropriate. 
The Bank w i l l continue t o monitor t h e 
aggregate f i s c a l position and prospects and its 
implications for recurrent cost financing. I n 
determining Bank financing o f recurrent costs in 
individual projects, the Bank w i l l take in to 
account sustainability issues at the sector and 
project levels, including implied future 
budgetary outlays. Bank financing o f recurrent 
costs i s expected to remain within the modest 
ranges o f recent years. 
The two requirements are met. The Bank may 
finance local costs (on investment projects) in 
the proportions needed i n individual projects. 

Taxes and duties are considered reasonable and 
non-discriminatory. The Bank may f inance 
taxes and duties associated with project 
expenditures. The application o f this general 
approach w i l l be subject to ongoing monitoring 
o f Bhutan’s tax policy and i t s implementation in 
Bank projects. A t t h e project level, the Bank 
would consider whether taxes and duties 
constitute an excessively high share o f project 
costs. 

Summary Background N o t e

. I n individual projects, information on the borrower’s use o f own resources to fund i t s 
Cost Sharing. The following approach w i l l be taken to cost sharing in Bhutan: 
development program for t h e sector concerned w i l l be taken into account.

IDA ’S ove ra l l f inanc ing envelope w i l l n o t change. In i n d i v i d u a l projects, fund ing f r om 
government o r f r om other sources w i l l be generally encouraged, in order t o leverage Bank 
resources and take advantage o f partnership opportunities. This funding, however, need n o t be 
p rov ided in each case (see below). 
I n cases where sources o f f inanc ing are n o t read i ly available t o co-finance a program, the Bank 
may finance 100 percent o f a l l project / program costs. 
This approach w i l l be implemented in t h r e e ways: (i) w i t h i n the C A S framework , the B a n k w i l l 
discuss with Government o n an annual basis the upcom ing pro jec ts in the p ipe l ine , and agree on 
tentative f inanc ing contributions f o r these projects; (ii) cost sharing w i l l be discussed at the 
Pro jec t Concept N o t e (PCN) stage after consultation w i t h the government; and (iii) current 
operations may be rev iewed and re tro f i t ted on a case-by-case basis where appropriate. 
A l l o f these actions w i l l be framed within the overa l l IDA a l loca t ion f o r Bhutan, and the 
understanding that decisions to finance f u l l y a given pro jec t may have an impac t o n the size o f 
fu ture IDA credits, and/or on the number o f projects t o be financed b y the Bank . 

2 . 
F o l l ow i n g the approach described above, the B a n k may finance up t o 100 percent o f the costs o f 
ind iv idua l projects. A t the ind iv idua l pro jec t level, f inanc ing ( f r om other than IDA) may come f r om 
RGoB, beneficiaries, t h i r d par ty international donors and financiers, o r when feasible, f r om loca l 
governments. These con tr ibu t ions do no t need t o be prov ided o n a ma tch ing payment-by-payment basis. 
The Bank w i l l be able t o finance the full amount o f specific expenditures, rather than a pro-rata share o f 
a l l (or nearly a l l) pro jec t expenditures. These measures w i l l streamline pro jec t budget releases and 
payment processes and a l l ow pro jec t managers t o focus o n the techn ica l aspects o f pro jec t 
implementation. Thus, f r om bo th an aggregate pro jec t cost po in t o f view, and f r om the pro jec t 
imp lemen ta t ion perspective, greater f l e x i b i l i t y in f inanc ing pro jec t costs w i l l help projects t o meet their 
development objectives. 

3 . 

Recurrent Costs . Development programs t y p i c a l l y invo lve b o t h cap i ta l investment outlays and 
recurrent costs, such as expenditures o n salaries or operation and maintenance (O&M). R G o B has 
fo l lowed a p o l i c y o f f inanc ing recurrent expenditures f r om domestic revenues, and cap i ta l investments 
f r om external financing, 
inc lud ing IDA. (On ly recently, and under the IDA grant f o r HIV/AIDS 
Prevention, the Governmen t decided t o u s e a sma l l amount o f IDA funds f o r opera t ing costs o f t h e P IU) . 
The Government, however, has expressed in te res t in exp lo r ing Bank f inanc ing o f recurrent expenditures, 
but in a manner consistent with the ir prudent f isca l stance. As discussed ea r l ie r , t h e ove ra l l f isca l and debt 
situation and prospects are considered reasonable. Moreover , accord ing t o OED reports, most Bank- 
financed projects i n Bhu tan have had reasonable sustainability prospects. 

4. 

W h i l e no spec i f ic limit i s proposed f o r the f inanc ing o f recurrent costs in ind iv idua l operations, 
th is type o f f inanc ing i s expected t o stay broad ly w i t h i n modest ranges. Recurrent cost f inanc ing w i l l also 
be decided b y considering sustainability i s s u e s at the sector and pro jec t levels, i n c l u d i n g im p l i e d f u t u r e 
budgetary outlays. A t the same time, the B a n k w i l l continue to m o n i t o r the aggregate f isca l pos i t ion and 
prospects and i t s imp l ica t ions fo r recurrent cost f inanc ing . 

5. 
L o c a l Cos t Financing. A ma jo r p ropo r t ion o f the country’s cap i ta l expenditure i s financed b y 
external assistance. L o c a l expenses comprise a re la t ive ly high p ropo r t ion o f pro jec t expenses in Bhutan, 
and Bank f inanc ia l support for these loca l costs i s c r i t ica l t o t h e v i a b i l i t y o f such projects. Specifically, 
about 93 percent o f to ta l disbursements between FY99 and FY04 were f o r l o c a l expenditures. G i v e n the 
geographical terrain and other cond i t ions specific t o Bhutan, fore ign expenditures are a re la t ive ly sma l l 
part o f t h e overa l l pro jec t cost. 

80 

Attachment 9: Country F inanc ing Parameters 
Page 3 of 3 

6. 
The Bank has t rad i t iona l ly financed loca l expenditures at a lowe r percentage than fore ign 
expenditures. Since the tw o requirements f o r Bank f inanc ing o f loca l costs are met, it i s proposed that 
fore ign and loca l expenditures be treated in the same way with regard t o Bank f inanc ing . This approach 
should prov ide greater f l e x i b i l i t y and reduced administrative burden f o r a large number o f Bhutan’s 
development projects. 

7 . 

Financing Taxes and Duties. Overall, Bhutan’s tax system i s re la t ive ly e f f i c i e n t and reasonable 
compared t o other lowe r income countries. Bhutan collects most o f i t s revenue f r om corporate income 
tax, sales taxes, d iv idends (hydropower), and grants. As in other countries, tax adm in is tra t ion in Bhu tan 
needs to be fur ther strengthened, and development partners are suppor t ing the R o y a l Government’s 
e f for ts in this area. The Ministry o f Finance issues tax p o l i c y guidelines. The tax rates are approved by the 
Na t iona l Assembly of Bhu tan . The Department o f Revenue and Customs (DRC) frames the 
administrative rules and regulations, and implements the tax policies. T a x co l lec t ion respons ib i l i ty i s 
decentralized to the d is t r ic t (dzongkhag) and further down t o the b l o c k (gewog) levels. In general, 
however, the capacity t o conduct full tax assessments and co l lec t ions in DRC and o ther levels o f 
government needs t o be expanded. 

8 . 
There are n o taxes o r du t ies tha t have been iden t i f ied as unreasonable o r d iscr im ina tory . 
A l though the sales tax rate ranges between 0 and 50 percent, the latter rate o n l y app l ies to non-essential 
items inc lud ing alcohol, tobacco, and cigarettes. Sales tax i s pa id at the po in t o f e n t r y (ma in ly the border 
c i t y o f Phuentsholing) by importers, with the exception o f ho te l services, cable services, movies, beer, and 
cement t o wh ich the tax i s app l ied at the po in t o f sale. The simple average o f the sales t a x in Bhu tan fa l ls 
between 5 to I O percent, and the e f fec t ive sales tax i s l i k e l y to be l ow e r because m o s t products impor ted 
f a l l e i ther w i t h i n the de f in i t ion o f essentials (e.g., f o o d items, w h i c h have a tax rate o f 0) o r r aw materials 
fo r industries w h i c h are exempted altogether. 

9 . 
Customs duty ranges f r om 0 t o 100 percent, bu t the la t ter o n l y applies t o tobacco products, 
alcohol, vegetable oils, and antiques. As noted in the Table above, the average t a r i f f rate i s 24 percent. 
Impor ts f r om I n d i a are n o t subject to customs duty (although some are subject t o sales tax) thanks t o the 
f ree trade agreement between I n d i a and Bhu tan . Impo r ts f r om third countries are subject t o b o t h customs 
du ty and sales tax. Th is i s relevant since I n d i a i s Bhutan’s largest t rad ing partner, accoun t ing on average 
f o r about 9 0 . percent o f Bhutanese exports (w i t h power as the largest expor t item) and about 80 percent o f 
imports. Moreover, the Bhutanese ngultrum i s pegged t o the Ind ian rupee, and Bhutanese impor ts f r om 
Ind ia are payable in rupees. Bhu tan also has a pre feren t ia l trade agreement with Bangladesh, i t s second 
larges t trad ing partner, w h i c h prov ides f o r du ty concessions o n a range o f negotiated p roduc t l ines . 

10. 
i n general, irrespective o f the source o f financing, a l l projects are treated in the same way f o r 
taxation purposes and n o d is t inc t ion i s made between Government financed pro jec ts and B a n k financed 
projects. Bank financed pro jec ts are therefore subject t o the same tax rates as are app l icab le t o a l l other 
projects that are implemented i n Bhu tan . 

11 . 
G iven the above circumstances, the Bank may finance taxes and duties associated w i t h pro jec t 
expenditures. The app l ica t ion o f this general approach w i l l be subject t o ongo ing m o n i t o r i n g o f Bhutan’s 
through non- lend ing TA ) and i t s imp lemen ta t ion in Bank projects. At the pro jec t level, 
the Bank wou ld consider whether taxes and duties constitute an excessively high share o f pro jec ts costs.
