EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Uruguay i s currently in the midst o f a dual transition. First, there i s an economic transition f rom 
the 2002 crisis towards a path o f equitable and sustainable development, as the economy 
continues to recover strongly. Second, there i s a po l i t ica l transition, as the v ic to ry o f the Frente 
Amplio - Encuentro Progresista - Nueva Mayoria coalition in the October 2004 elections 
marked a new phase in the country’s po l i t ica l history. 

The Government faces th ree ma in challenges in order to succeed with the economic transition, 
namely: (i) reducing vulnerability; (ii) sustaining growth; and (iii) imp rov ing l i v i n g standards. 

The challenge o f reducing vulnerability relates to debt sustainability, fiscal management and 
financial sector reforms. Debt sustainability w i l l continue t o be a major development challenge 
in the medium t e r m g iven the sharp increase in the public debt to GDP ratio as a resu l t o f the 
crisis. Heavy amortizations due in the period 2006-07 constitute a particular source o f 
vulnerability. Strong fiscal management w i l l be the key to reducing the debt burden over time 
while ensuring an environment o f p r i c e and exchange rate stability. Policymakers can build o n 
Uruguay’s impressive fiscal performance since the crisis wh ich culminated in a primary su rp lus 
o f 3.8 percent o f GDP in 2004. 

Meeting the challenge o f pu t t ing Uruguay o n a path o f higher longer-run growth w i l l depend 
upon structural reforms aimed at increasing investment, enhancing competitiveness, and creating 
an enabling environment fo r the private sector. Uruguay’s strong rebound f r om the c r is is , with 
12.3 percent g row th in 2004, has helped create a sound basis fo r these reforms. 

In imp rov ing l i v i n g standards, the new administration faces the challenge o f bringing the 
escalating costs of pub l ic pensions and health care under con t ro l in order to f ree up fiscal space 
for essential social investments inc lud ing an expanded social safety net. Uruguay has 
experienced a deepening o f social exclusion during the crisis and the new Government i s 
committed to addressing the problems associated with society’s most vulnerable groups. 

The proposed CAS aims to support the Government’s efforts t o mee t Uruguay’s development 
challenges in areas where the Bank has a comparative advantage. CAS preparation has benefited 
from extensive consultations and AAA work. This has included: (i) pub l ic discussion o f a 
Sources o f G row th study w i t h the current Minister o f Finance and h i s immediate predecessor, (ii) 
a two day Po l icy Notes seminar with the’full Cabinet, (iii) a C l ien t Survey conducted in July 
2004 which h igh l igh ted widespread in te res t in maintaining o r expanding Uruguay’s relations 
w i t h the multilateral financial institutions, (iv) consultations with c i v i l society, and (v) the 
lessons learned presented in the Completion Report o n the 2000 CAS and the 2002 CAS 
Progress Report. 

The proposed Bank assistance strategy i s anchored around a se r ies o f programmatic development 
loans that are expected t o be multi-sectoral in focus and support the Government in key po l icy 
areas including pub l ic sector management, financial sector reform, and re fo rm o f social 
programs. The investment lending pipeline w i l l be rebuilt with new operations planned to 
support p r io r i ty investments in infrastructure (transport, energy), social programs (reform o f the 

i 

na t iona l hea l th insurance system, support t o education), i n s t i t u t i o n building (tax administration, 
expenditure management), and innova t ion , science and technology. 

The C A S envisages a base case scenario o f up t o US$800 million ove r the p e r i o d th rough f isca l 
year 2010. T h e lending p rog ram w i l l be modu la ted o n the strength o f t h e Government’s p rog ram 
and i t s a b i l i t y to imp lemen t it, as w e l l as the country’s creditworthiness and the Bank’s exposure. 
Se l f -co r rec t ing mechanisms are built i n t o the C A S t o modu la te Bank exposure in l i n e with 
performance benchmarks.

we re t o f a l l b e l o w expectations, the Bank w o u l d reve r t t o a l o w case scenario, with to ta l lend ing

A. Overview 

I. INTRODUCTION 

1. 

Uruguay i s currently in the midst o f a dual transition. 
First, there i s an economic 
transition f r om the 2002 crisis towards a path o f equitable and sustainable development. The 
Uruguayan economy has bounced back since mid-2003 and continues t o enjoy a strong recovery. 
Real GDP g row th in 2004 was 12.3 percent, and the forecast fo r 2005 i s fo r further 6 percent 
growth. The success with wh ich Uruguay was able to weather the economic crisis o f 2001-02 
owes much to i t s prompt and purposeful response to events as they unfolded. The economic 
crisis did not provoke a po l i t ica l crisis nor did i t interrupt the normal procedures o f government. 
Po l i t ica l continuity enabled the Government t o manage proactively the economic situation and to 
mob i l ize long established e lemen ts o f a social safety ne t t o mitigate, but no t prevent, the impact 
o f the crisis on poverty. Concerted support f rom the international financial community was also 
important in assisting the difficult adjustment. As a resu l t o f those combined efforts, Uruguay i s 
on track to fully recover i t s pre-crisis leve l o f income (Figure 1). The country i s well positioned 
to service i t s sovereign debt and embark upon a path o f sustained g row th provided sound 
macroeconomic policies and the agenda o f post-crisis structural re fo rm continues to be 

implemented.

Second, there i s a po l i t ica l transition. The v ic to ry o f the Frente Amplio - Encuentro 
Progresista - Nueva Mayoria (FA-EP-NM) coa l i t ion in the October 2004 elections ended 170 
years o f dominance o f Uruguayan po l i t ics by the two traditional par t ies , the Pa r t ido Colorado 
and the Partido Nac iona l . The new Government took o f f ice o n M a r c h 1, 2005. Uruguay i s an 
open society and the po l i t ica l transition pe r iod has been smooth. The Frente Amplio reached 
agreement with the tw o traditional pa r t ies as well as independents o n an overall framework fo r 
the conduct o f economic po l icy , foreign po l icy and education policies. The resulting "Inter-party 
Agreement" o f February 16, 2005, specifically comm i ts a l l pa r t ies t o honor the outcome o f the 
2003 debt renegotiation. I t also acknowledges the need fo r strict fiscal discipline to satisfy the 
urgent social needs o f U ruguay while, at the same time, generating an adequate primary fiscal

su rp lus . A l though many specifics s t i l l remain to be determined, i t augurs well for stability and 
continuity o f t h e body po l i t ic that a multi-partisan agreement could be reached so early in the 
new administration.

To accompany Uruguay’s economic and po l i t ica l transition, there i s a need for continued 
support f r om the international financial community. The new administration has worked to 
establish a close relationship w i t h multilateral lenders inc lud ing the Bank, wh ich plans to open 
an office in Montevideo in the coming months. The proposed country assistance strategy adopts 
a threefold focus: 

0 Ana ly t ica l wo rk to help the Government to articulate selected areas o f i t s program. 

0 Rebu i ld ing o f the investment project pipeline in areas that wou ld enhance growth, 
increase competitiveness, and reduce poverty and social exclusion. 

0 Continued development po l icy lending t o support implementation o f strategically 
important reforms to help the Government t o reduce macroeconomic vulnerability, 
sustain g row th and improve l i v i n g standards. 

4. 

The last CAS, d iscussed by the Board o f Executive Directors o n June 6, 20001, fo l lowed 
upon a decade o f macroeconomic stability and growth in Uruguay. In v iew o f the country’s 
relatively h i g h leve l o f economic and social development at the time, the 2000 CAS 
contemplated a progressive reduction in Bank support and a transition to graduation. The 
relatively strong g row th performance o f Uruguay during the n ine t ies was tempered by a sharp 
recession in 1999, wh ich was in part a spillover f rom even ts in neighboring Argentina and 
Brazil. However, when the CAS was prepared, i t was no t foreseen that the recession wou ld 
deepen and the economy wou ld become seriously destabilized late in 200 1 when neighboring 
Argentina defaulted upon i t s pub l ic debt and devalued i t s currency t o one third o f i t s previous 
value. A CAS Progress Report2 prepared in mid-2002 covered the truncated period FY03-04, in 
comparison to the FYO1-05 program of the o r ig ina l CAS. The Progress Report was prepared at a 
time when the economic situation in Uruguay was deteriorating rap id ly due, in part, to a run o n 
bank deposits provoked by even ts in Argentina. The full dimensions o f the c r i s i s and i t s likely 
outcome could no t be clearly discerned because events were s t i l l un fo ld ing . Never the less , the 
2002 Progress Report determined that the 2000 CAS lending scenario was no longer appropriate 
and concluded that additional support was needed to assist Uruguay t o weather the crisis and to 
introduce specific reforms ranging f rom fiscal measures to increase revenues and curtail 
spending, to bank restructuring, p romo t ion o f efficiency and competition in infrastructure, 
maintaining investment in human capital and strengthening measures to protect vulnerable 
groups. 

5 . 

The rap id pace at w h i c h events were developing in 2002 required that the August 2002 
Progress Report be supplemented with an Update3 w h i c h was discussed by the Board o f 
Executive Directors together with the Progress Report o n August 8, 2002. The Progress Report 
and i t s Update proposed adjustment lending as the p re fe r red i n s t r um e n t for increased Bank

support to U ruguay during the crisis period. Tw o Structural Adjustment Loans (SALS) and tw o 
Special Structural Adjustment Loans (SSALs ) were envisaged over the pe r iod FY03 -04 totaling 
U S $ 5 5 0 m i l l i o n (Box 1). Some operations in the pipeline o f the o r ig ina l 2000 CAS were 
delayed, and a new project t o help s tem the outbreak o f aftosa resulting in a substantial loss in 
competitiveness, was added. 

Box 1: Support fo r Structural Adjustment in Response to Crisis 

The C A S Progress Repor t o f August 2002 proposed adjustment lend ing as the preferred 
ins trumen t f o r Bank support to U ruguay during the crisis. As a result, the Bank extended 
structural adjustment loans t o U ruguay in the course o f FY03 . The p r inc ipa l characteristics o f 
these operations a re ou t l ined be low . The i r implementation i s summarized in Annex 1. 

A SAL (SAL I, Repor t No . 245 15-UR) in the amount o f US$15 1.5 m i l l i o n was approved 
in August 2002. The loan supported macroeconomic and f isca l actions centered on restraining 
pub l ic sector wages. 
In addition, the system o f social pro tec t ion was t o be strengthened by 
imp rov ing management and by safeguarding budget allocations. Unemp loymen t insurance was 
to be re fo rmed and t ra in ing fo r the unemp loyed was to be streamlined. A Special SAL (SSAL I, 
Repor t No. 245 15-UR) in the amount o f US$15 1.5 m i l l i o n was also approved in August 2002. 
That loan focused spec i f ica l ly on support fo r restructuring o f the Na t iona l Mo r tgage Bank as par t 
o f a broader re fo rm o f the bank ing system w h i c h was also rece iv ing support f rom the IMF. B o t h 
the SAL and the Special SAL have been fully disbursed. 

In addition, a Pub l ic Services and Soc ia l Sectors SAL (SAL 11, Repo r t No . 25012-UR) in 
the amount o f US$15 1.5 m i l l i o n was approved in April 2003. The ove ra l l ob jec t ive o f the loan 
was to boost competitiveness and economic g row th through the better p rov is ion o f pub l ic and 
social services and infrastructure. T o tha t end, a broad range o f s truc tura l and po l icy reforms 
were iden t i f ied with respect t o infrastructure and pub l ic services. A Pub l ic Services and Social 
Sectors Special SAL ( S S A L 11, Repor t No . 25012-UR) in the amount o f US$101 m i l l i o n was also 
approved in April 2003. Tha t loan a imed at imp rov ing the equ i ty and e f f ic iency o f public 
expenditures in hea l th and education by suppor t ing measures to imp rove management and give 
budgetary pro tec t ion t o p r i o r i t y programs. The f i r s t tranche o f bo th the Pub l ic Services SAL and 
Special SAL was disbursed when the loans were approved in April 2003. T w o tranches fo r the 
Pub l ic Services SAL ( fo r a to ta l amount o f US$lOO m i l l i o n ) s t i l l rema in t o be disbursed and t w c 
tranches fo r the Pub l ic Services Special S A L ( for a to ta l o f US$75 m i l l i o n ) w i l l be cancelled 
(para. 8 9 ) .

The Bank’s response was part o f a concerted mu l t i la te ra l effort, w h i c h h r n i s h e d a 
combined US$4 b i l l i o n o f commitments, one o f the la rges t such efforts as a percentage o f GDP 
ever carried out (Table 1). In this context, the IMF took the lead in p rov id ing c r i t ica l emergency 
support accounting for over 70 percent o f commitments, with the Bank and the IADB p rov id ing 
the remainder. The coordinated e f fo r t by the international community and the determined po l icy 
response o f the authorities, supported by a l l o f the ma jo r parties, enabled U ruguay to achieve a 
recovery that compares favorably with other crisis countries o f the past decade. L o o k i n g 
forward, the Bank w i l l continue to w o r k with the Vhzquez Government to t rans fonn what was 
essentially a crisis response towa rd a balanced medium-term assistance p rog ram centered o n key 
investments to sustain g row th and promote social development.

In retrospect, i t i s clear tha t the c r is is in U ruguay was pa r t icu la r ly severe when compared

11. COUNTRY CONTEXT AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 

A. Political Context 

8 . 

The first-round v ic to ry o f the F r e n t e Amplio party in Uruguay’s presidential election on 
October 31, 2004 marked the f i r s t time in more than 170 years that the executive i s no t being 
controlled by e i the r o f the tw o traditional parties-Partido Colorado (PC) a n d Pa r t ido Nac iona l 
(PN). President Vhzquez’s victory after two previous attempts i s interpreted, among other 
things, as a certain disenchantment o f the electorate with the governance practices o f t h e 
traditional pa r t ies . The recession starting in 1998, the financial crisis in 2002, the dissolution o f 
the governing coa l i t ion in November o f that same year, the limited scope fo r renewal in the 
ru l ing party, and poverty levels above 30 percent helped the F r e n t e to win the elections in the 
round with just over 50 percent o f the vote. 

first 

9. 
A l though the F r e n t e has embraced an agenda fo r change, i t has also signaled continuity 
in many o f the policies that have enabled the economic rebound. The new Government’s agenda 
fo r sustained g row th abides by the recen t referendums that have guaranteed a predominant role 
fo r 
the state 
in certain strategic economic sectors 
(Le., water, petroleum, and 
telecommunications), while a im ing to improve the climate for private sector investment. I n i t i a l 
indications are that the new administration w i l l be seeking an increased professionalism and 
transparency o f the state, maintain prudent macroeconomic policies, and improve r u l e s o f the 
game for the private sector as the catalysts fo r stimulating the private sector in a proactive and 
productive role. There appears to be broad consensus within the F r e n t e Amp l io on this strategy 
and the economic team enjoys a h i g h degree o f respect and broad support. The new 
administration has proactively sought dialogue with the International Financial Institutions (IFIs) 
and the active support o f these institutions in formulating and implementing i t s development 
agenda. 

10. 
President Vhzquez has begun his presidency with broad support bo th domestically and 
f rom the international community. The economic environment i s also benign. Recovery f rom 
the crisis years has been robust, and g row th should continue to be so l id over the near-term. 
Unemployment has been cut significantly f rom the depths o f the crisis and investment i s p ick ing 
up. Obstacles remain and some outstanding reforms w i l l continue to be demanding po l i t ica l ly . 
Nevertheless, the Government i s well positioned to address Uruguay’s development challenges. 

B. Recent Economic Developments 

11, 

Fo l low ing upon a pe r iod o f macroeconomic stability and steady g row th during most o f 
the n ine t ies , Uruguay suffered a sharp reversal in 1998 with a recession that pe rs is ted fo r more 
than th ree years before collapsing in to a deep economic crisis provoked, in large part, by events 
in neighboring Argentina. W h e n Argentina defaulted o n i t s pub l ic debt, abandoned the U S 
dollar as a monetary anchor and devalued i t s currency t o one third o f i t s previous value, the 
e f f e c t upon Uruguay was disastrous. There was a rush to w i thd raw deposits f rom the banking 
system driven in i t ia l ly by the exposure o f Uruguayan banks t o Argentina’s country risk and later 
fo r fear that the Government o f Uruguay may f o l l ow the example o f Argentina and restrict 
withdrawals. As a resu l t , the important offshore banking sector and, eventually, the domestic 

5 

banking sector came under severe pressure and a number o f banks collapsed, notwithstanding 
emergency government support. A ripple effect throughout the economy caused GDP to f a l l b y 
some 11 percent in 2002 alone, while unemployment rose to almost 20 percent by end-2002. 

12. 
I t i s l i k e l y that the outcome wou ld have been much worse had i t no t been fo r an effective 
adjustment e f fo r t by the Uruguayan authorities, and the consensual nature o f the country’s 
po l i t ica l system. The success with wh ich Uruguay was able to weather the economic crisis o f 
2001-02 owes much to i t s prompt and purposeful response to events. Negotiations with creditors 
led to the successful conclusion o f a sovereign debt exchange in May 2003, raising the average 
maturity o f bonds b y over 5 years without increasing in te res t rates and w i thou t a reduction in 
principal (Box 2). Fiscal and monetary po l icy were w e l l managed wh ich resu l ted in a primary 
s u r p l u s o f the public sector (excluding sub-national administrations) o f 3.8 percent o f GDP in 
2004 (a major turnaround g iven that there was a primary fiscal de f ic i t o f 1.5 percent o f GDP in 
2001). Fo l low ing a modest pass-through to in f la t ion f rom the 2002 devaluation ( in f la t ion peaked 
at 25.8 percent that year), in f la t ion was brought down t o single d ig i t figures. 

6 

Box 2: U ruguay Deb t Res t ruc tu r ing 

In April 2003, Uruguay proposed a sovereign debt exchange to a l l holders o f government bonds 
denominated in foreign exchange and having an in i t ia l maturity o f 12 months or more. T h e objective o f the debt 
restructuring was to b r ing debt servicing obligations into l i n e w i t h the country’s prospective post-crisis payment 
capacity. Cash-flow r e l i e f was to be obtained by extending maturities without reducing the pr inc ipa l due. T h e 
proposal applied to US$3.8 b i l l i o n o f bonds that had been issued on the international markets and to US$1.6 
b i l l i o n o f bonds issued on the domestic market. I t i s estimated that approximately two thirds o f a l l eligible bonds 
were held by residents o f Uruguay. 

Two options were offered to bondholders. The f i r s t was to swap existing bonds for new bonds w i th an 
extended ma tur i ty but w i t h pr inc ipa l and in te res t unchanged. A second op t ion was to o f fer a choice o f altemative 
benchmark bonds w i t h different maturities and w i th cash incentives for bondholders who chose longer benchmark 
bond maturities. In the case o f bonds that had been issued on the domestic market, the menu o f options was more 
extensive, inc lud ing progressive step-up i n t e r e s t rates. A n important feature o f the debt swap was that a l l new 
bonds were subject to collective action clauses that wou ld facilitate fu tu re debt restructuring. 

Voluntary participation in the bond swap was 92.5 percent w i t h most participants opting for altemative 
benchmark bonds rather than simple extended maturities. T h e high rate o f participation may be attributed to two 
factors. First was pr ior consultation w i t h creditors before the t e rm s o f the exchange were announced so that 
creditors were able to participate in the design o f exchange options. Second was the strong IF1 support for 
Uruguay’s adjustment program. 

Figure 3 shows how, before the cr is is , Uruguay was able to command a much lower spread than other 
countries o f L a t i n America. At the time o f the cr is is , the spread for Uruguay rose sharply but, after the success fu l 
renegotiation o f debt w i t h bondholders, it declined quickly and i s now s l igh t ly be low the average for the Region.

13. 
GDP g r ow t h in 2004 i s estimated to have been 12.3 percent due in part to good economic 
management but also t o favorable external developments, including h i g h commodity prices for 
exports and strong economic g row th in bo th Argentina and Brazil (Table 2). Consumption and 
in particular investment started t o recover f r om 2003 onwards. Prospects fo r continued 
economic g r ow t h in 2005 are good. A modest strengthening o f the peso and higher o i l p r ices 
w i l l no t offset the greatly enhanced competitiveness o f Uruguay wh ich resu l ted f r om the 2002 
devaluation. R is ing employment and some increase in real wages i s likely to boost domestic 
demand. Real g row th of 6 percent i s projected in 2005 and that wou ld raise per capita incomes 
close to pre-crisis leve ls . At the same time, a disciplined monetary po l icy together with a modest 
appreciation o f the peso i s likely to keep in f la t ion within the 5.5-7.5 percent target range o f the 
Central Bank. A p r ima ry surplus o f 3.5 percent o f GDP i s targeted in 2005, slightly down f rom 
the 3.8 percent recorded in 2004 in order to accommodate the new Government's social 
emergency program.

C. T h e Social I m p a c t o f the Crisis 

14. 
The 1998 recession and the subsequent economic c r i s i s had a severe social impact. 
Unemployment increased from about 10 percent in 1998 to 17 percent at the end o f 2002 (Figure 
5), albeit this figure declined to 13 percent by the end o f 2004. During the pe r iod f r om 1998 to 
2002, the p ropo r t ion o f self-employed and o f those employed in the in fo rma l sector also grew 
and was accompanied by a reduction in rea l wages in the p r iva te sector. Household income also 
started to decline in 1998, and f e l l by more than a fifth in the pe r iod f r om 1998 to the end o f 
2002 as i t was negatively impacted b y poor performance o f the labor market in t e rm s o f j o b 
creation and wage behavior. As a resu l t , according to data from the Ins t i tu to Nac iona l de 
Estadistica (INE), poverty increased between 2000 and 2003 f r om 18 percent t o 3 1 percent o f 
the population, wh i le extreme pove r ty also doubled to 2.8 percent o f the population during the 
s am e period. Desp i te this increase, extreme pove r ty remained l o w in Uruguay with respect to the 

8 

other L a t i n Ame r ican countries. The strong economic recove ry has ye t t o be re f lec ted in a n 
imp rovemen t the ove ra l l pove r ty rate. Income inequa l i ty has t rad i t iona l ly been l o w in U ruguay 
when compa red t o the rest o f the reg ion . However, inequa l i ty also increased du r ing the pe r iod 
be tween 1998 and 2002 (Figure 6), and this exerted a s ign i f ican t nega t ive e f fec t o n pove r ty . 

15 . W h i l e pove r ty and unemp loymen t increased t o reco rd leve ls in the a f te rma th o f the crisis, 
the Gove rnmen t response m i t iga ted a po ten t ia l ly m u c h stronger nega t ive impac t o n b o t h quantity 
and q u a l i t y o f service de l ive ry . Repercussions o n basic soc ia l ind ica to rs such as school

111. THE GOVERNMENT’S DEVELOPMENT AGENDA 

16. 
The new Government’s program as enunciated in Tabark Vhzquez’s electoral document 
E l Gobierno de Camb io - La Transicidn Responsable suggests a broad continuity o f 
macroeconomic policies, wh ich i s in l i n e w i t h the traditional consensus s ty le o f government in 
Uruguay, but with increased emphasis on social programs and confirmation o f a central role o f 
the state. The document proposes a new national development strategy fo r the country 
articulated along six key complementary themes: enhancing p roduc t iv i ty (Uruguay Productivo), 
fostering social development (U ruguay Social), promoting innovation (Uruguay Innovador), 
strengthening democracy (U ruguay Democrdtico), enhancing regional and global integration 
(Uruguay In teg rado ) and promoting policies wh ich consolidate and promote Uruguayan culture 
(Uruguay Cu l tu ra l ) . 

17. 

In a nutshell, the program o f the new administration aims at attaining economic 
development in manner wh ich i s at the s am e time productive, integrated, equitable, o f good 
quality and sustainable. Development should be productive in that i t should leave room fo r 
promoting areas as diverse as biotechnology, information and communication technology, 
tourism and culture-based on the premise that while no country can be competitive in a l l areas, 
i t wou ld be wrong t o limit unnecessarily areas in which Uruguay m i g h t achieve regional and 
international competitiveness. Development should be trade-oriented and better integrated w i t h 
bo th Mercosur partners and beyond. Development should also be equitable in a territorial sense, 
so as no t to give way t o d ispa r i t ies among areas wh ich are labeled as successful and areas wh ich 
are labeled as depressed. Development should be o f good quality in that i t should maximize a 
national production w h i c h i s competitive and qualified - w h i c h i s based on, good educational 
quality fo r all, leading t o equal employment opportunities, especially fo r the youth. Development 
should f ina l ly be sustainable, no t on ly in environmental but also in social t e rm s - and poverty 
should therefore be fought with policies aimed at c i v i l participation and social inclusion. 

A. Uruguay Productivo 

18. 

Uruguay Productivo places h i g h and sustained g row th as a top p r io r i ty in the 
Government’s agenda. This w i l l be attained through the coherent implementation o f structural 
changes and short-term economic policies. Structural changes w i l l a im t o establish clear r u l e s o f 
the game between the State and the market, to transform the financial sector, to develop capital 
markets and de-dollarize the economy. “U ruguay Productivo” also calls fo r state reforms, 
including imp rov ing professional and technical qualification o f c i v i l se rvan ts , enhancing 
transparency and accountability in the conduct o f state functions, decentralizing management and 
eradicating a l l forms o f clientelism. The Government plan further calls fo r promoting public 
investment through the use o f bo th ow n resources and external credits and fo r including the 
private sector as a concessionary under certain conditions. An additional structural re fo rm 
contemplated b y the proposed program i s tax reform, which should be guided by the principle o f 
fairness and serve as a stimulus to productive investment. Tax re fo rm w i l l encompass 
introduction o f a personal income tax. Another ma jo r change that the Government intends to 
introduce i s that o f seeking stronger t i e s w i t h Mercosur. The plan also calls fo r improvements in 
extra- regional commercial relations, thereby continuing to build o n the dynamism o f exports to 
these markets.

B. U ruguay Social 

19. 

Uruguay Social underscores the need to transform the quality o f l i f e o f Uruguayans with 
special emphasis o n the most vulnerable, thereby fostering social inclusion. One o f the f i r s t 
actions o f the n ew Administration was the creation o f a new Social Emergency Program called 
PANES (P lan de Asistencia Nacional a l a Emergencia Social). The objective o f the p lan i s to 
attend t o t h e needs of individuals be low the extreme poverty l i n e o r in h i g h risk o f fa l l ing below 
i t - estimated t o include some 200,000 individuals, or 6 percent o f the population - through a se t 
o f eight, coordinated programs (basic food, health emergency, minimum income, education fo r 
c r i t ica l areas, workfare, two housing programs, and homelessness). Several o f these programs a re 
not new, but in the past they have not been very effective in reaching the poor. The emergency 
plan seeks to overcome these obstacles and reach the need ies t in society, using the structure o f 
existing institutions (such as the BPS) and volunteers. Enrollment in the program began on April 
1, and nearly 100,000 heads o f household applied in the f i r s t mon th (they w i l l be ind iv idua l ly 
interviewed and assessed to identify targeted households). Payments o f the minimum income 
scheme, fo r approximately US$50 a month, are expected to start in M a y 2005. The implementing 
agency i s the new Ministry o f Social Development wh ich i s s t i l l being organized. 

20. 

The incom ing administration has also put education h i g h on i t s agenda, inc lud ing a 
promise to raise overall funding fo r the education sector t o improve equity, imp rov ing 
achievements, and mak ing school education more re levan t fo r the labor market. This wou ld 
requ i re a legal re fo rm wh ich the incom ing administration has announced as part o f i t s Uruguay 
Social program. The new Government has indicated that i t s goal in the health sector i s to create a 
more harmonized system through the introduction o f a national health insurance that wou ld 
ensure more equitable access to services and improved quality o f care, while reducing the 
financial burden of the system. 
In that context, a key strategic need wou ld be t o improve the 
incentive framework fo r a l l actors in the system, primarily through reducing fragmentation and 
increasing the effectiveness o f financial and regulatory incentives fo r efficiency and equity. 

C . U ruguay Innovador 

21. 
Uruguay Innovador focuses o n the need to promote scientific and technological progress 
in order to reverse the current trend o f stagnation and centers o n a strategy o f specialization and 
increased quality. Under Uruguay Innovador, the incom ing administration lays out i t s goal to (i) 
revamp existing institutional relationships within the creation o f a Na t iona l System o f 
Innovation; (ii) draft a strategic innovation plan fo r the country wh ich wou ld b r ing together 
p r io r i ty sectors (including agro-industry, natural resource conservation, technology and 
communications, the health system, manufacturing and tourism); (iii) orientate the en t i re 
education system, most importantly the Universidad de la Repziblica, towards scientific and 
technological applied research with strong l i n k s to the productive sector; and (iv) support 
innovation in the small and medium en te rp r ise sector. 

D. Uruguay Democratic0 

22. 
Uruguay Democrdtico emphasizes among other the need fo r greater transparency and 
efficiency o f government, inc lud ing the decentralization o f functions in government and the 
strengthening o f the internal auditing, the p romo t ion o f greater transparency and social 

11

I V . URUGUAY’S DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES 

25. 
Uruguay i s s t i l l struggling to recover f rom the social and economic consequences o f the 
prolonged recession over 1999-2001 and the deep c r i s i s o f 2002. However, n ow that t h e 
economy i s rebounding f rom the crisis, the Government’s p r io r i t ies have shifted f rom c r is is 
response to the achievement o f the longer-term objective o f equitable and sustainable economic 
development. In addition, an overarching goal o f the Government’s program i s that o f fostering 
social participation and increasing inclusion. The fo l low ing sections outline the ma in challenges 
the Government needs to address, bo th at the macroeconomic l e v e l and in key sectors o f the 
economy, in order to attain i t s objective. 

A. Reducing Vulnerability 

26. 

Debt sustainability w i l l continue to be a major development challenge in the medium 
t e r m notwithstanding the successful debt restructuring o f 2003 wh ich provided r e l i e f f rom 
l iqu id i ty pressures in the bond market (accounting fo r about h a l f o f a l l sovereign debt) over the 
short and medium te rm . After restructuring, the ratio o f public debt t o GDP i s estimated to have 
stood at nearly 90 percent at end-2004 (Figure 7). Heavy amortizations due in the period 2006- 
07, inc lud ing payments to the IFIs, constitute a source o f vulnerability.

27. 
Debt sustainability w i l l depend c r i t ica l ly upon generating a primary fiscal surplus 
sufficient to service the debt and that issue w i l l be examined in greater detail in the fo l low ing 
section. Over and beyond fiscal considerations, however, debt sustainability w i l l also depend 

13 

upon managing the debt proactively to ensure that i t s size, i t s term-s truc ture and i t s currency 
composition correspond to the needs and to the repayment capacity o f Uruguay. 

28. 
The currency composition o f Uruguay’s debt has become a ma jo r focus o f public 
attention ever since the 2002 economic c r i s i s revealed how readily a debt denominated in foreign 
currency can expose the economy to external vulnerabilities. A pub l ic debt denominated in 
foreign currency restricts the maneuverability o f the central bank to manage monetary po l icy and 
an insufficiency of peso denominated instruments may also s t i f l e the development o f the 
domestic capital market by mak ing i t more vulnerable to t h e exchange rate. The prevailing 
sentiment in Uruguay favors issuing more peso denominated debt in bo th domestic and 
international markets (in particular, indexed peso debt), rather than debt denominated in foreign 
exchange, to the extent that the costs o f bo r row ing in pesos are competitive. 

29 . 

A strong foreign exchange rese rve pos i t ion and a favorable debt composition are essential 
e lemen ts o f sound integrated asset and l iab i l i ty management which can help the Government 
better manage the roll-over o f debt as i t falls due. As o f Ma rch 2005, the international reserves 
o f Uruguay were equivalent to 8.4 months o f imports, s u f f i c i e n t to cover projected public debt 
service in 2005. To further strengthen i t s liquidity cushion, Uruguay cou ld requ i re f inanc ia l 
institutions t o carry liquidity rese rves on foreign currency deposits that a re higher fo r non- 
res iden ts and inversely related to the maturity o f the deposit. 

30. 
Fiscal management i s one o f the p r inc ipa l ins t rumen ts available t o the Government in 
pursuing the objective o f sustained growth with equity. The new administration has signaled i t s 
intention to maintain t igh t fiscal po l icy . In addition to issues o f debt sustainability discussed in 
the previous section, strong fiscal management w i l l be a sine qua non fo r macroeconomic 
stability and growth. Whereas, in many other areas o f economic and social po l icy the 
Government may have an ample choice o f options, the re w i l l be few degrees o f freedom in 
conducting fiscal po l icy . 

31 . 

After restructuring the pub l ic debt in 2003, Uruguay continued to strengthen i t s fiscal 
position (Figure 8). This po l icy stance w i l l need to be maintained in order t o achieve primary 
su rp luses compatible with debt sustainability. The primary surplus i s expected t o be maintained 
at 3.5 percent o f GDP in 2005 and increase t o 3.7 percent in 2006 and t o 4 percent o f GDP f rom 
2007 onwards. Projections indicate that fiscal reforms w i l l be required to achieve primary 
s u r p l u s e s o f this order (Annex 2). 
In addition to several new revenue initiatives and more 
e f f ic ien t tax collection, by far the most effective way to increase fiscal revenues i s to accelerate 
the rate o f GDP growth. 

32. 
Options fo r increasing fiscal revenues are few. The new administration has pledged to 
introduce a personal income tax and that cou ld provide a significant new source o f revenue in the 
longer-run. However, a personal income tax i s administratively complex and i t w i l l need to be 
carefully planned and prepared if i t i s to be applied effectively and equitably. I t w i l l take time 
for procedures and administrative structures t o be put in place. Meanwhile, the Government w i l l 
need to re ly upon already established sources o f fiscal revenue . There a re particularly good 
prospects for enhancing revenues from soc ia l security contributions wh ich declined f rom 6.1 
percent o f GDP in 2000 to 3.7 percent o f GDP in 2003. Better coordination between the Tax 
Administration Department (DGI) and the agency wh ich administers the social secu r i ty system 

14 

(BPS) could, a ided by the on -go ing economic recovery, resu l t in a rebound o f revenues f r o m 
cu r ren t ly l o w leve ls .

Expend i tu re con t ro l has been k e y t o the f isca l stance ove r the las t f e w years, with primary 
expenditure f a l l i n g by f i v e percentage p o i n t s o f GD P ove r 2002-04. M a i n t a i n i n g a p o l i c y o f

achieve this th rough a c om b i n a t i o n o f expenditure sw i tch ing po l ic ies t o fund new in i t ia t ives and 
expenditure reduc ing measures. Pensions are by far the largest s ing le i t e m o f p u b l i c expenditures 
in U ruguay and they account f o r m o s t o f the g r ow t h in expenditures ove r the last t e n years. 
Imp lemen t ing re fo rms t o c o n t r o l the g r ow t h in pens ion spending w i l l b e a m a j o r challenge (para. 
64). Pub l ic sector emp loymen t was reduced by some 10 percent be tween 1995 and 2002, 
a l though there i s s t i l l r o o m f o r add i t iona l e f f ic iency imp rovemen ts w h i c h c o u l d imply in te r a l i a 
further reduc t ion in p u b l i c emp loymen t ove r time, in pa r t icu la r t h r o u g h a t t r i t i o n and vo lun ta ry 
retirement schemes. Changes in p u b l i c emp loymen t w o u l d be l i n k e d t o broader imp rovemen ts in 
the c i v i l service and p u b l i c sector management (paras. 58-60). Increased p r iva te sector 

15 

participation cou ld help to increase fiscal space by reducing demand o n the budget f r om 
infrastructure investment needs (paras. 49-54). 

35 . 
The financial sector remains a potential source o f vu lne rab i l i ty fo r Uruguay and i t s 
contribution t o g row th needs t o be strengthened. The 2002 crisis was devastating fo r the banking 
sector. Many p r iva te commercial banks collapsed, leaving the sector even more dominated by 
pub l ic banks than was the case before the cr is is . The tw o traditional pub l ic banks (BROU and 
BHU) have n o w been j o i n e d by a third, the Nuevo Banco Come rc ia l (NBC), established with 
assets salvaged f r om several private banks driven in to bankruptcy by the crisis. Public banks 
n ow account f o r 60 percent o f a l l banking assets. The crisis revealed deep structural and 
managerial weaknesses in B R O U and BHU. The authorities have extended emergency 
assistance to both banks w h i c h a re undergoing structural re fo rm with support f r om the IMF and 
f r om the IBRD. I t i s important that these restructuring efforts continue to be diligently pursued. 
The N B C complicates the picture because, with branches throughout the country, i t competes 
directly with BROU . The N B C (wh ich operates under commercial law) i s currently seeking a 
foreign strategic investor. However, i t wou ld be t ter se rve the long-term in te res ts o f the banking 
sector i f the N B C were to be privatized. What remains o f the private banking system after the 
2002 crisis i s a sma l l ne two rk o f foreign-owned banks and a few domestic banks o f fe r ing short- 
ma tu r i ty dollar-based products. The financial pos i t ion o f these banks i s so l id and many o f them 
can draw upon support from large parent-banks abroad. They are well placed to take advantage 
o f the vacuum l e f t by l iqu ida ted domestic banks. In particular, there i s scope fo r engaging more 
actively in the capital markets and for extending value-added serv ices . The Government has 
recently introduced legislative reforms regarding anti-money laundering and combating the 
financing o f terrorism, w h i c h n o w await implementation. 

36. 
The p r inc ipa l challenge for the financial sector in Uruguay today i s to reestablish a stable 
and e f f i c i e n t system o f f inanc ia l intermediation between depositors and borrowers that can 
channel capital to productive investments. The p rob lem i s no t a lack o f deposits. Deposits by 
res iden ts have already surpassed the l e v e l o f July 2002 when the bank mo ra to r ium was imposed. 
Never the less , banks, bo th pub l ic and private, a re highly liquid. There are a number o f reasons fo r 
that: 

0 The vast ma jo r i ty o f deposits in the system today are sight deposits wh ich cou ld be 
w i thd rawn at the slightest sign o f trouble and banks must prepare themse lves for that 
poss ib i l i ty by ma in ta in ing h i g h leve ls o f liquidity and lending with short-term maturity. 

0 Risk aversion and liquidity considerations encourage banks to lend predominantly 
within the financial sector so that 61 percent o f the to ta l loan po r t fo l io i s between 
financial institutions. Loans to the non-financial sector have decreased b y almost 60 
percent since December 2001, and access to credit has been squeezed, particularly fo r 
smaller bus inesses . 

0 Mos t deposits (90 percent as o f end-June 2004) are foreign currency denominated and, 
as a resu l t of the crisis, banks are acutely aware o f the danger o f extending foreign 
currency loans t o borrowers whose income i s exclusively peso-denominated. Hence 
lending i s concentrated o n the export sector. 

16 

37. 
T h e p rob lems con f ron ted by the bank ing sector stem in part f r o m l i m i t e d confidence, but 
also f rom s t ruc tu ra l challenges inc lud ing : 

a T h e l a c k o f a s ign i f ican t ma rke t f o r peso-denominated f inanc ia l products has greatly 
increased the vu lne rab i l i ty o f the f inanc ia l system t o ex te rna l shocks. The recent 
i n t r o d u c t i o n o f in f la t ion - indexed (UI) deposits was an impo r tan t step to encourage the 
deve lopmen t o f peso-based f inanc ia l services. 

, 

a A recen t ly in t roduced deposit insurance p rog ram remains un-funded. I f the scheme i s 
funded and imp lemen ted selectively t o peso and UI deposits in the f i r s t instance, this 
w o u l d increase confidence in the bank ing system as a who le and he lp foster a gradual 
“pesification” o f the f inanc ia l sector. 

a F i n a n c i a l sector regu la t ion and supe rv is ion w i l l p l a y an impo r tan t r o l e in the recove ry

ensure the full techn ica l independence o f f inanc ia l sector supervisory and regu la to ry 
ac t iv i t ies within the Cen t ra l Bank. 

a O f f -sho re banking me r i ts special a t ten t ion f r o m the regulators. Given the d is t inc t r i s k s

B. Sustaining G row th 

39. 
Ove r the past thirty years pe r cap i ta income g r ow t h averaged l i t t l e m o r e than one percent 
a year. Re la t ive t o many countries, U r u g u a y has f a l l e n steadily behind. Whereas, in 1980, the

stability and ove ra l l improvement in l i v i n g standards w i l l no t be achievable. 

Figure 9 : GDP Per Capita in Uruguay (PPP) as Percent o f USA 

40. 

Longer-run economic g row th w i l l depend upon structural and p o l i c y reforms aimed at 
increasing investment and enhancing competitiveness. The Bank recently completed a 
comprehensive study o n sources o f g row th in Uruguay w h i c h examined in detail the issues that 
need to be addressed. The Sources o f G row th study contains detailed recommendations for 
consolidating fiscal and financial reforms, imp rov ing the e f f ic iency o f factor markets, fostering 
integration through trade and investment, p romo t ing competition in infrastructure and, in 
general, imp rov ing the bus iness climate for private sector development (Annex 3). Even with 
stronger growth, however, i t w i l l take many years for Uruguay t o catch up with the metropolitan 
countries o f Europe and N o r t h America. Table 3 illustrates the size o f the task using Spain as a 
comparator country. Were Uruguay to g row at 4 percent a year, i t w o u l d take a minimum o f 26 
years to catch up with Spain and, i f Spain i t s e l f were to g row at a modest 2 percent, i t wou ld t a k e 
Uruguay fully h a l f a century to catch up.

Trade. MERCOSUR has been t h e most important vehicle o f trade po l icy fo r Uruguay for 
many years past. The recent economic crisis has revealed weaknesses in the structure and the 
share o f Uruguay’s merchandise exports to i t s MERCOSUR partners f e l l f r om 5 5 percent in 
1998 to an estimated 24 percent in 2004. The decline was exacerbated b y the impos i t ion o f 
significant non - ta r i f f ba r r ie rs by Argentina and Brazil in an e f fo r t to protect their ow n domestic 
producers. 

42. MERCOSUR cou ld best harness i t s potential fo r trade expansion by p rov id ing a context 
fo r member countries to j o i n forces and gain more leverage in trade negotiations with industrial 
countries w h i c h favor high agricultural protection. W h i l e striving t o mob i l ize MERCOSUR to 
the f u l l e s t extent possible, Uruguay should also pursue bilateral trade agreements with other 
countries wherever these h o l d a potential fo r trade gains. The bilateral agreement concluded 
with Mex ico has led to an acceleration o f trade and i t illustrates w e l l h o w such agreements can 
be advantageous fo r Uruguay. A f ree trade agreement with the USA, and by extension the 
proposed FTAA, cou ld bring substantial gains for Uruguay and other MERCOSUR countries. 
Similar gains cou ld come from a free trade agreement with the European Un ion . Agreements 
with the USA and/or European U n i o n can be beneficial even i f they f a l l short o f a final-best 
arrangement that dismantles a l l programs o f domestic assistance and export subsidies in the USA 
and the EU. Trade agreements with indus t r ia l countries w o u l d also en ta i l intangible advantages 
in te rms o f investment, qua l i ty and variety, standard and regulation. 

Agriculture, natural resources and environment. Agriculture has been the p r inc ipa l source o f 

43. 
growth for Uruguay in the past and the sector possesses considerable potential fo r further 
growth. The agriculture and agro-industry sectors represen t approximately 23 percent o f 
Uruguay’s GDP; over h a l f o f agricultural output i s exported and accounts fo r more than 60 
percent o f Uruguay’s to ta l export earnings. The currency devaluation o f 2002 increased t h e 
competitiveness of Uruguayan agriculture in w o r l d markets. This i s a temporary boost, however, 
and longer-term competitiveness w i l l hinge o n fundamental structural changes. A stronger, more 

19 

competitive agriculture can be built o n th ree main pillars: (i) the development and dissemination 
o f new technologies, (ii) improved product quality based upon good production and processing 
practices and food safety and (iii) the establishment o f a new institutional structure to enhance 
competitiveness. 

44. 

Food safety i s a major concern fo r the agricultural sector. I t i s estimated that losses f rom 
the recent foot and mou th disease epidemic amounted to US$730 m i l l i o n during 2001-03, or 
almost 2 percent o f GDP annually. To avert a repetition o f the crisis, concrete measures should 
be developed together with a l l neighboring countries to guarantee food safety and avoid further 
disease outbreaks in the livestock population. 

45. 

The longer-term success o f agriculture in Uruguay w i l l depend c r i t ica l ly upon conserving 
the natural resource endowment. Advances already made in stemming erosion, so i l degradation 
and cultivating vulnerable land should continue to be pursued. In particular, increased livestock 
production w i l l depend upon the improved management o f natural pastures, and increased 
agricultural production w i l l requ i re stronger water resource management. As more and newer 
i r r iga t ion investments are made and generate more pressure o n limited resources, the need for an 
improved water resources po l icy and regulatory framework w i l l increase. 

46. 

The substantial potential fo r forestry development in Uruguay i s w ide ly acknowledged 
and major foreign direct investments are currently being undertaken. New forest plantations 
have been located in “p r io r i ty areas” which are relatively unsuitable fo r other agriculture. As 
these activities expand, i t w i l l be important to assess further the environmental sustainability o f 
commercial forestry, especially with respect to surface water, soils and biodiversity. Sustainable 
industrial processing o f forestry products calls fo r careful environmental assessment o f proposed 
new investments, as w e l l as ongoing po l lu t ion mon i to r ing and control. 

47. 

The above pillars cou ld help to improve l i v i n g conditions in the ru ra l areas where poverty 
i s relatively higher than in the urban areas. In 2000, the poverty rate in ru ra l towns was 27 
percent, a full ten percentage points higher than in urban areas. However, g iven the l o w labor 
intensity o f many agricultural product l i n e s , the agriculture sector alone i s no t sufficient to 
generate adequate productive employment to l i f t the ru ra l poor out o f poverty. W i thou t growth in 
rural non-farm alternatives, ru ra l wages are l i k e l y to remain l o w - i.e., o f ten at or be low the 
poverty l ine . In order t o support g row th in non-farm employment, particularly in the small ru ra l 
towns, additional targeting o f educational and productive services w i l l be needed. 

48. 

Po l lu t ion i s a manageable challenge that can be kept under con t ro l through effective 
preventive measures. Na t iona l environmental challenges include urban degradation (especially 
solid waste management and urban air pollution); coastal contamination (both in the degrading 
international waters o f the R i o Plata and the A t lan t ic coast with i t s strong coastal tourism 
industry); and industrial po l lu t ion (including major new investments in industrial processing o f 
forest products). The institutional and legal framework i s considered to need improvement and 
this i s on the l i s t for action under the new Government. 

49. 

Infrastructure and public services. In t e rm s o f coverage and quality, the provision o f 
infrastructure and pub l ic services in Uruguay i s good when compared with other L a t i n American 
countries and middle-income countries in other regions. However, the re are shortcomings with 

20 

respect t o e f f i c i e n c y and, as a consequence, some services are re la t ive ly expensive compared t o 
other countries in the reg ion . This i s pa r t icu la r ly the case f o r water and hydrocarbons and, t o a 
lesser extent, other energy sources. 
Ine f f ic ienc ies in in f ras t ruc tu re and p u b l i c services a f fec t

50. 
The transport sector i s a good example where re fo rms have im p r o v e d e f f ic iency and 
quality. U r u g u a y boasts a re la t ive ly e f f ic ien t road sector and an im p r o v i n g p o r t sector. The 
primary r o a d n e tw o r k i s in better cond i t ion than in any other coun t ry in the reg ion . Overall, the 
number o f containers has increased by 160 percent since 1993 , the year after p o r t sector reform, 
and the absolute cost o f m o v i n g a container i s s im i la r t o that o f other po r ts unde r concession in 
the region. T h e im p r o v i n g competitiveness o f transport services i s associated with progress 
achieved in sector r e f o r m w h i c h i s s t i l l on -go ing and needs t o b e consolidated. The r e f o rm has 
iden t i f ied ins t i tu t iona l respons ib i l i t ies within the Government f o r p o l i c y fo rmu la t ion , planning, 
and regu la t ion o f the sector and g radua l ly in t roduced private-sector pa r t ic ipa t ion in varying 
fo rms i n t o cons t ruc t ion and maintenance operations. The increased p r i v a t e sector pa r t ic ipa t ion 
has he lped im p r o v e management practices in b o t h p u b l i c and p r iva te sector, and generated 
add i t iona l investment. 

51. 
The u t i l i t i e s and p u b l i c services are almost exc lus ive ly in the hands o f the p u b l i c sector, 
and p o l i c y de f in i t ion , regu la t ion and operations are generally me rged in the sector agencies and 
p u b l i c enterprises. The e f f ic iency shortcomings o f the u t i l i t i e s sectors re la t ive t o the transport 
sector suggest tha t a s ign i f ican t m a r g i n f o r imp rovemen t exists. The experience o f the transport 
sector shows tha t e f f i c i e n c y gains can b e achieved th rough a comb ina t ion o f distinguishing the 
three separate functions o f p o l i c y de f in i t ion , regu la t ion and operations o n the one hand and 
p romo t ing p r iva te pa r t ic ipa t ion o n the other. In the u t i l i t ies , progress has been made in separating 
these functions, but m o r e can be done. 

52. 
The rede f in i t ion and strengthening o f the p o l i c y f u n c t i o n at the m i n i s t r y l e v e l i s an 
essential challenge, together with strengthening the lega l and regu la to ry f ramewo rk . In practice, 
the u t i l i t i e s con t inue t o p l a y a cen t ra l r o l e in defining t a r i f f s w h i c h are t h e n con f i rmed by the 
Government o n the basis o f f isca l rather than e f f ic iency c r i te r ia . T h e responsible m in is t r ies lack 
strong p o l i c ym a k i n g u n i t s and there i s an absence o f p u b l i c l y ava i lab le analysis t o support key 
government decisions. In the absence o f strong p o l i c y leadership at the ministry level, p u b l i c 
utility operators have f requen t ly taken u p o n themselves p o l i c y issues by de fau l t . 

53. 
Presently, sector l aw s ex is t in U ruguay o n l y f o r p ow e r and commun ica t ions . Sector laws 
f o r natural gas and for wa te r supply and sanitation have been subm i t ted t o Congress but have yet 
t o be approved. The need f o r a such a l a w i s especially pressing in the case o f water supply and 
sanitation where the ins t i tu t iona l f ramewo rk i s pa r t icu la r ly comp lex . In the case o f pe t ro leum 
products, a sector l a w was enacted but subsequently annu l led f o l l o w i n g a referendum, leav ing a 
legislative v o i d t o b e f i l l e d . Regu la to ry bodies have been established f o r powe r , natural gas, 
pe t ro leum products, wa te r supp ly and sanitation (URSEA), te lecommun ica t ions and pos ta l

54. 

Infrastructure and pub l ic service sub-sectors a l l have their ow n ind iv idua l challenges over 
and beyond the cross-cutting issues o f regulation, governance and private sector participation. 

0 The challenges faced in the transport sector focus o n completing and consolidating the 
sector reforms, particularly in the ports and ra i lway sectors, but also in attaining higher 
l e v e l s o f investment in order to: (i) ensure stable functionality and good condition o f 
ma jo r transport infrastructure l i n k i n g producers t o markets fo r agricultural, livestock and 
forestry production; and (ii) a r res t further deterioration o f infrastructure resulting f r om 
the maintenance backlog as a resu l t o f the economic crisis. 

0 The challenges in energy include; (i) adopting impo r t pa r i ty prices fo r fue ls ; (ii) 
in t roduc ing yardstick competition or other incentives t o increase supply efficiency; (iii) 
developing programs fo r reducing energy losses and increasing end-use efficiency; (iv) 
imp rov ing energy interconnections with Argentina and Brazil to tap their wholesale 
markets through long-term supply contracts; and (v) establishing an operational 
wholesale energy market (ADME). 

a 

In add i t ion to the need fo r yardstick competition and programs t o reduce unaccounted-for 
water, the water supply and sanitation sector faces the challenge o f achieving universal 
coverage. O n l y a very small percentage o f the popu la t ion lacks potable water (about 2 
percent), but a large share o f the population (35 percent b y some measures) lacks 
household sewerage connections and sewerage treatment services. Un ive rsa l coverage o f 
water supply and sanitation services i s a key factor fo r imp rov ing living standards in l i n e 
with the Millennium Development Goals. 

5 5 . 

Enabling environment for the private sector. 

In order t o create a more conducive 
environment fo r the p r iva te sector, the Government faces challenges in th ree areas: (i) creating 
public-private partnerships; (ii) imp rov ing the lega l framework fo r firm en t ry and exit; and (iii) 
fostering innovation. The Government sees the instrument o f public-private partnerships as a 
“transversal” arrangement that may se rve many pub l ic sectors in order to enhance efficiency and 
mobilize much needed additional (private) resources w i thou t resorting to (repeatedly rejected) 
privatization schemes. Specifically, U ruguay cou ld bene f i t f r om public-private partnerships in 
sharing the r i s k s invo lved in innova t ion systems, and in the development o f adaptation 
technology, the fo rma t ion o f a market-information based culture, as well as change management 
and communication strategy. 

56. 

One o f the most serious problems affecting compe t i t ion s tems f r om regulations wh ich 
limit the mob i l i ty of f i rm s in the Uruguayan market. This i s pa r t ia l ly due to the legal framework 
on bankruptcy and receivership w h i c h i s in need o f modernization as i t promotes negative 
incentives and increased costs due to time lags and ambiguous r e s u l t s f r om bankruptcy 
proceedings. SMEs rarely obtain bankruptcy insurance due t o h i g h costs and a lack o f 
accounting records w h i c h are required b y regu la t ion in order to f i l e a pe t i t ion fo r bankruptcy, 
thereby fa i l ing to take advantage o f t h i s important protection. A more comprehensive legal and 
jud ic ia l framework for declaring bankruptcy in U ruguay cou ld be an important s tep fo r private 

22 

sector development. To be effective, i t wou ld be important to accompany this with adequate 
capacity-building fo r the specialized bankruptcy courts and administrative agencies that have 
ju r isd ic t ion in this area. 

57 . 

Desp i te recent advancements, SME development and innova t ion p o l i c y need further 
strengthening. The system i s characterized by a number o f specific innova t ion and SME support 
programs wh ich lack a strategic v is ion and adequate coordination among the different 
implementing institutims. This resu l ts in fragmentation, as well as dup l ica t ion o f efforts and 
resources. Recently some actions have been taken, such as the establishment o f an SME network, 
with encouraging resu l ts . These measures provide greater strategic and operational consistency 
to the Na t iona l Innova t ion Strategy and they help the planning, fund ing an execution o f 
programs. To further promote innovation and to facilitate the implementation o f the Na t iona l 
Innova t ion Strategy, i t i s also important t o promote linkages between research and bus iness , and 
more generally between the pub l ic and private sector. 

58 . 

State modernization. The new administration 
recognizes 
that a broad-based 
reorganization o f the pub l ic sector i s required to realize i t s v is ion o f a strategic government ro le 
in economic management. Key challenges include c la r i fy ing ins t i tu t iona l responsibilities- 
inc lud ing the functions o f policy, regulation and operation discussed above, preempting potential 
conflicts o f interest, enhancing transparency, strengthening accountability, and increasing 
operational efficiency. The scope o f the challenge i s enormous and success w i l l depend not on ly 
on po l i t ica l will, but also o n a well designed strategy that takes advantage o f the w indow o f 
opportunity facing the new Government. P r io r i ty action areas encompass tax administration, the 
regulatory re fo rm agenda, management o f state companies, as w e l l as streamlining pub l ic 
services t o respond more e f fec t ive ly to the needs o f the popu la t ion and o f fe r an enabling 
environment fo r the private sector. Decentralization i s a potentially impo r tan t means to enhance 
the efficiency o f the state and increasing c i v i l society participation in pub l ic management. The 
new Government has identified the need for a single citizen registration process wh ich w i l l s e r v e 
multiple purposes, inc lud ing imp rov ing the efficiency o f pay ro l l control, subsidy and other social 
policies, pub l ic u t i l i t ies , tax administration, electoral processes and property rights registration. 

59. Modernization o f the state has a central ro le in efficient pub l ic expenditure management. 
W h i l e Uruguay has p rev ious ly pursued a system o f performance management in the pub l ic 
sector, specific targets and indicators reflecting efficiency and qua l i ty should be made pub l ic o n 
a regular basis so that performance can be adequately evaluated. Policies to increase the 
professionalism o f Uruguay’s c i v i l service cou ld include l i n k i n g performance evaluation, bonus 
and p romo t ion to the achievement o f targets. Full implementation o f projects invo lv ing state 
purchasing and other procurement reforms w o u l d lead t o greater transparency and increased 
competition among suppliers as w e l l as a more e f f ic ien t procurement process, particularly within 
Uruguay’s Central Administration. 
B r ing ing the S ICE (Sistema Integrado de Compras 
Estatales) in to broader u s e within the pub l ic administration w o u l d a l l ow fo r compliance with the 
procedural r u l e s and ensure that payments b y the State are recognized fo r purchasing. I t wou ld 
also permit a more wide-ranging con t ro l over calls fo r bids, an aspect that i s currently d i f f i c u l t to 
control in Uruguay. F ina l ly , i t w i l l be important to expand and strengthen substantially the 
country’s pub l ic expenditure mon i to r ing and evaluation (M&E) systems. The Government i s 
well aware o f the potential o f a well-designed, carefully managed M&E system in supporting the 
creation o f fiscal space and re-composition o f pub l ic expenditure in l i n e with i t s priorities.

A k e y challenge f o r the Government i s t o imp rove e f f ic iency in the adm in is t ra t ion o f 
state-owned companies, and the qua l i ty o f the i r goods and services, by p romo t ing a mo re

61. W h i l e U r u g u a y dedicates a la rge p o r t i o n o f i t s income t o the soc ia l sectors, the bulk o f 
the expenditures are concentrated in p u b l i c pensions and health. High leve ls o f expenditures in

Box 3: Who i s Vulnerable in Uruguay? 

While poverty and other social indicators in Uruguay are better than in much o f La t in America, 
social conditions deteriorated substantially during the recession and crisis. Many categories saw increases 
o f up to 100 percent, with unemployment increasing from 10 to 17 percent between 1998 and 2003, while 
poverty spiked from 17 to 31 percent and extreme poverty doubled to 2.8 percent over 2000-03. 

The 2003 Poverty Update (Report No . 26223-UR) provides u s e f u l insight into who in Uruguay 
was most vulnerable to the damaging effects o f the crisis, and suggests where interventions to address the 
causes o f the vulnerability can be most effective. The Poverty Update provides a breakdown o f vulnerable 
groups into gender, spatial and minority. In general, those households in which the head i s unemployed, 
employed in the informal sector or self-employed, Le., not having social security benefits, were more 
likely to be poor. Crowded households, households headed by young men, workers in sectors sensitive to 
economic downturns such as construction, or individuals w i t h l ow educational attainment were also 
particularly vulnerable. The young are overrepresented among the poor, and this situation has worsened 
during the recession. 

Finally, although small in absolute number, rural poverty rates exceed those o f major urban areas, 
and non-agricultural wage-earners l i v i n g in small towns are more likely t o be poor than farmers and farm 
in the more dispersed areas. I n 2000, the poverty headcount was 25.0 percent fo r small settlements o f 
900-5000 inhabitants, 28.2 percent fo r villages w i th l e s s than 900 inhabitants, and 19.5 percent for 
dispersed rural areas; wh i le the urban poverty headcount was 17.2 percent. Mo re recent rural poverty data 
i s not available. The relative high incidence o f rural poverty i s especially significant as over 40 percent o f 
the rural Door are children, many o f whom have l e f t school and entered the labor market at a young age.

Social protection and poverty alleviation. W h i l e to ta l spending o n social p ro tec t ion 

( inc lud ing b o t h soc ia l insurance and social assistance expenditures) in U ruguay i s high compared 
t o the R e g i o n and even the O E C D countries, the system i s dom ina ted by p u b l i c pensions w h i c h 
have absorbed the equ iva len t o f 18 percent o f G D P o n average during the past 5 years. There i s 
amp le evidence tha t the high cost o f p u b l i c pensions has c rowded ou t p u b l i c expenditures o n 
other m u c h needed p rog rams o f soc ia l p ro tec t ion such as unemp loymen t bene f i ts and transfers in 
kind and in cash t o the poor. As a resu l t , the coverage o f these other p rog rams i s uneven and 
many u rgen t soc ia l needs rema in unattended. F o o d transfer programs were ca l led u p o n t o 
expand the i r ac t iv i t ies by as m u c h as one third in the wake o f the econom ic crisis. W h i l e i t 
appears tha t these p rog rams are w e l l targeted towa rds the poor, i t i s n o t clear whether they are as 
effective as cash transfer programs in comba t ing poverty. 

63. 

Similarly, the recent economic crisis revealed serious shortcomings in the p r o v i s i o n o f 
unemp loymen t benefit w h i c h i s cu r ren t ly available o n l y t o wo rke rs w h o have con t r ibu ted 
insurance p rem iums t o the Banco de Previsidn Social (BPS) during the 12 m o n t h p e r i o d p r i o r t o

64. 

Public pensions. As men t ioned above, p u b l i c pensions cu r ren t ly c r ow d ou t other 
impo r tan t human deve lopmen t investments. In concert with e f fo r ts t o strengthen con t r ibu t ion 
enforcement, several measures c o u l d help bring the escalating cost o f p u b l i c pensions under 
con t ro l . First, there c o u l d be a closer link be tween the re t i remen t age and increases in longev i ty . 
Second, cons ide ra t ion c o u l d be given t o res t ruc tu r ing the re la t ionsh ip be tween re t i remen t age 
and the replacement ra te o f pensions so as t o reduce the f inanc ia l pressure o n the system. Third, 
a phased in t roduc t ion o f a d i f fe ren t index ing scheme -wh ich w o u l d p ro tec t the rea l value o f 
pensions also in t imes o f c r is is - c o u l d be considered. The present p rac t ice o f i n d e x i n g pensions 
t o wages (set unde r the Constitution), together with a p rog ress ive ly ag ing population, poses 
impo r tan t constraints o n con ta in ing the cost o f the pens ion system. In other countries, a sh i f t 
f r o m pu re wage towa rds an index based o n a m i x t u r e o f p r ices and wages has y ie lded substantial 
savings. Pension reforms w o u l d h e l p in p r om o t i n g economic e f f ic iency and faster growth, while 
making the social p ro tec t ion system m o r e responsive t o the ob jec t ives o f equ i ty and pove r ty 
reduction.

Health. No tw i ths tand ing recent imp rovemen ts in several impo r tan t hea l th ins t i tu t ions in 
the coun t ry ( inc lud ing the M i n i s t r y o f H e a l t h a n d the Fondo Nac iona l de Recursos, un ive rsa l 
insurance f o r high c om p l e x i t y interventions), U r u g u a y faces a numbe r o f serious challenges in 
the hea l th sector. The re i s a n u rgen t need t o con ta in the heavy f inanc ia l cost o f hea l th care 
w h i c h continues t o increase year by year and w h i c h threatens t o become unsustainable. U ruguay 
invests about 11 percent o f i t s GDP o n hea l th care, one o f the h ighes t ra t ios in the wo r ld . The 
high l e v e l o f hea l th expenditures i s due t o a cons te l la t ion o f factors inc lud ing : techno log ica l 
change, an unduly comp lex ins t i tu t iona l structure with ove r lapp ing respons ib i l i t ies and 
inadequate incentives for e f f ic iency , a highly regu la ted p h y s i c i a n labo r ma rke t that undermines 
the a b i l i t y o f hea l th organizations t o con t ro l the i r pe rsona l costs, and a de l ive ry system tha t i s n o t 
well matched t o the hea l th needs o f the popu la t ion . T h e f ragmen ta t ion o f the system n o t o n l y

The m a i n f inanc ia l p rob lems o f the hea l th sector are man i fes ted in the long - te rm f inanc ia l 
c r is is o f the I A M C s (Co l lec t ive M u t u a l Care Institutions). M o s t o f the I A M C s - especially those

Education. In terms o f outcomes, Uruguay’s education system stands ou t in L a t i n 
America, but compares less favo rab ly with O E C D countries (Table 4). A s o f 2003, 95 percent o f

increased, though at m o r e moderate rates. N a t i o n a l student assessment results indicate 
substantial imp rovemen ts in achievement be tween 1996 and 2002.

Despite progress, the educa t ion system i s fac ing challenges tha t need t o be addressed. 
First, ove ra l l spending in educa t ion continues t o b e l ow . At 3.6 pe rcen t o f GDP (2003 ) , U ruguay 
invests considerably less o n educa t ion than the average L a t i n Am e r i c a n coun t ry (and even mo re 
so as compared t o the O E C D average). Second, a l though U ruguay ’s focus o n f u l l - t im e schools 
has been generally acc la imed t o have reduced inequities, such inequ i t ies persist and their 
reduc t ion i s at the t o p o f the agenda o f the n e w adm in is t ra t ion . Inequ i t ies in lea rn ing outcomes 
between ch i ld ren o f d i f fe ren t soc io -econom ic backg round con t inue t o b e high and manifest 

26 

themselves in unequal pre-school attendance. In-depth analysis to de te rm ine the degree to wh ich 
the current system of teacher and student assignments contributes to maintain inequ i t ies in the 
system wou ld he lp p r io r i t ize appropriate po l icy measures. Third, the qua l i ty and relevance o f 
secondary and technical schools cou ld be improved. About ha l f o f those who enter secondary 
and technical education drop out before completion, with such drop-outs disproportionately 

representing s tuden ts from poorer families. Fourth, the pub l ic university system displays similar 

challenges as in many countries, such as a considerable discrepancy between planned and actual 
length o f ma t r icu la t ion and a bias in access towards students f r om higher income f am i l i e s . 
University reform, inc lud ing introducing incentives fo r students to finish their s tud ies o n time, 
and reduction o f the secondary school drop-out rate are key p r io r i t ies fo r the country to improve 
i t s competitive edge in a globalized wo r ld economy. Lastly, administration o f the education 
system cou ld benefit from modernization and efficiency improvements. This wou ld entail, in te r 
alia, a streamlining o f ANEP, the autonomous ins t i tu t ion w h i c h currently leads the country’s 
education system. The b ra in d ra in o f educated you th f r om Uruguay poses an additional challenge 
to human capital formation, as according to the most recent estimates (2002) about 12 percent o f 
the country’s professionals and technicians have migrated to other countries. 

70. 
Social inclusion, gender and civil society. W h i l e U ruguay i s considered an homogeneous 
society compared to other countries in the region, and has the most equal income distribution in 
South America, i t has experienced a deepening o f social exclusion during the last crisis, e.g. for 
Afro-descendents, youth, women and the ru ra l poor. Uruguay has the largest Afro-descendents 
population in the Southern Cone. This group has h is to r ica l ly experienced above-average poverty 
and unemployment rates, lower wages, and educational attainment rates that are consistently 
be low the average fo r the general population. In the case o f Uruguayan youth, those between the 
ages o f 15 and 24 account for on ly 16 percent of the to ta l popu la t ion but 46 percent o f total 
unemployment. O f the unemployed youth, on ly 2 percent receive some sort o f training and on ly 
4 percent obtain unemployment insurance. H a l f o f the unemployed you th in Uruguay did not 
finish secondary school and are unprepared fo r skilled jobs, while those who a re unemployed are 
frequently employed in unstable and precarious jobs, with scarce possibilities o f social mob i l i ty . 
As risk factors increase for youth, inc lud ing lack of opportunities fo r ga in fu l employment, the 
attractiveness o f alternative methods fo r gaining welfare th rough c r ime and violence increases, 
as does the incidence o f drug and alcohol consumption, with consequent costs fo r society. The 
new Government i s comm i t ted t o addressing the problems associated with society’s most 
vulnerable groups, and has created a new Ministry o f Social Development in wh ich to focus i t s 
efforts. This young Ministry w i l l need support in facing this broad se t o f challenges. 

71. 
Despite Uruguay’s reputation as a socially progressive society, recent research indicates 
that women continue to suffer 
f r om discrimination. The male-female wage gap, and labor 
participation gap closed s ign i f ican t ly between 1990 and 2000, but there was no progress 
thereafter. There i s a pe rs is ten t wage d i f fe ren t ia l o f approximately 14 percent between male and 
female wages for s im i la r w o r k overall, and higher s t i l l for men and women with higher leve ls o f 
education. Further, fewer women than men receive unemployment insurance, independently o f 
the leve l o f education. Clearly, more proactive labor market po l ic ies and intermediation se rv ices 
to foster a non-discriminatory labor market w o u l d help addressing t h i s issue . In addition, 
domestic violence remains a serious p rob lem in Uruguay, as a recent su rvey found that 46 
percent o f women married o r living with a partner suffered f r om domestic violence in the 
previous year. A l though considerable progress has been made in t e rm s o f legislation to address 

27 

domestic violence, more remains to be done particularly in t e rm s o f imp rov ing access to justice 
fo r the most vulnerable groups. 

72. M i l lenn ium Development Goals. Uruguay has made major progress towards reaching the 
M i l l e n n i um Development Goals (MDGs). As indicated in Annex 4, Uruguay i s mak ing good 
s tr ides towards attaining the goals related to education, gender, c h i l d and maternal mo r ta l i ty 
rates, especially in view o f the crisis wh ich the country has undergone in the recent years. The 
goal to reach the poverty reduction target, formulated as reducing by h a l f the percentage o f the 
population living o n l e s s than U S $ l per day, suffered a set-back du r ing the crisis years in l i n e 
with the large increase in the o f f i c i a l poverty rate. A l though poverty i s expected to decline with 
continued economic growth, i t i s likely to take years o f sustained g row th and improved social 
policies to bring poverty down to pre-crisis leve ls and below. F ina l ly , the MDG related to 
environmental sustainability shows good progress fo r water, but somewhat less so fo r sanitation. 
M o r e than one third o f urban households s t i l l lack proper sanitation services, and this rate wou ld 
have to be reduced to about one fifth b y 201 5 t o m e e t the target.

V. MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK 

73. 
The macroeconomic framework projected for Uruguay under the base case envisages 
steady state GDP g row th o f 3 percent in the medium te rm . This projection assumes: (i) 
continued macroeconomic stability and improved creditworthiness underpinned b y strong fiscal 
performance and reduced financial sector vulnerability, and (ii) higher investment and 
productivity underpinned by broad-based improvements in the investment climate. Sustained 
progress on the structural re fo rm agenda to address the development challenges facing Uruguay 
i s assumed to contribute to the strong fiscal fundamentals and imp roved investment climate 
supporting the base case scenario. The investment to GDP ratio i s projected to r i s e steadily 
towards 18 percent, some 2-3 percentage points above historical leve ls . The projected 3 percen t 
growth rate i s higher than the historical average o f 2.0 percent (1965-2004), but not 
unprecedented in Uruguay. Fo r example, the economy recorded average g row th o f 4.4 percen t 
during 1991 -97, that is, the pe r iod p r io r to the recession and the c r is is . 

74. 
Strong fiscal performance i s c r i t ica l to realizing higher levels o f growth. Sustaining a 
primary s u r p l u s at o r above the 3.8 percen t o f GDP recorded in 2004 i s an achievable challenge 
for Uruguay. A sustained p r ima ry s u r p l u s o f this order i s an important factor to generating a 
“virtuous circle” whereby imp rov ing public creditworthiness lowers vulnerability and supports 
macroeconomic stability which in turn promotes economic g row th w h i c h then contributes to 
fiscal performance and a fa l l ing pub l ic debt to GDP ratio. The Government’s program includes 
reforms to strengthen revenues (such as a new personal income tax, reducing evasion in social 
security contributions, increases in the VAT base, elimination o f low yield distortionary taxes) 
and also a commitment to keep expenditures under control.

75. 
Price s tab i l i ty i s another important e lemen t o f the projected macroeconomic framework. 
Keeping i n f l a t i o n under con t ro l can be important to avoid a spiral o f in f la t ion and wage increases 
that cou ld jeopardize fiscal performance and undermine the investment climate. The base case 
scenario assumes that in f la t ion remains l o w under continued tight macroeconomic policies and 
gradually converges to international leve ls , that is , to 3.5 percent per year starting in 2007. 
Consumer i n f l a t i o n i s projected at 5 percent in 2005-06. The real exchange rate (RER) i s 
projected to move o n a modestly appreciating trend through 2007 and then remain constant 
thereafter, thereby stabilizing in an intermediate range between the depreciated l e v e l o f the 1980s 
and the more appreciated l e v e l o f the 1990s. 

76. 
Reforms in the financial sector that are underway are a core element in t h e ’ g r ow t h 
strategy. These reforms aim to reduce financial sector vu lne rab i l i ty and improve financial 
intermediation. The new Government has committed to continue the re fo rm process. Key 
p r io r i t ies include: (i) strengthened bank supervision with greater efforts to comply with 
international standards and greater independence f r om possible po l i t ica l interference; (ii) 
upgraded prudential regulation to manage r i s k s arising f r om non-resident deposits and currency 
mis-matches; (iii) imp roved bank ex i t procedures; and (iv) continuation o f the state bank 
restructuring p rog ram inc lud ing measures to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and improve 
corporate management. 

77. 
Other reforms incorporated in to the base case projections include measures to improve 
the business climate such as s imp l i f ica t ion o f procedures and regulations fo r new businesses, 
improvement o f commercial justice procedures, measures to promote research and development 
in small and med ium en te rp r ises and to facilitate their access to international markets. The base 
case scenario i s also predicated o n steady progress to reduce costs o f pub l ic services and 
maintain Uruguay’s infrastructure. This encompasses improvements in regulation and measures 
to improve e f f ic iency in their utilization. The scenario further envisages a comprehensive 
program o f social policies (including health, education, social protection) t o enhance Uruguay’s 
human capital and promote social inclusion. 

78. Under the base case macroeconomic framework, pub l ic sector creditworthiness indicators 
a re projected to imp rove steadily over time. Public debt as a share o f GDP i s projected t o decline 
gradually f r om an estimated 9 2 percent as o f end-2004 t o about 60 percent b y 2010 (Table 6). 
Debt service as a share o f to ta l government revenues i s also projected to decline over time after a 
peak in 2006 o f 49 percent, t o about 35 percent by 2010. Mu l t i la te ra l debt service i s projected to 
decline as a share o f to ta l debt service, f r om about 50 percent in 2005 t o about 44 percent in 
2010. A strong p o l i c y framework, supported b y the IFIs, and projected improvement in 
creditworthiness are expected to enhance Uruguay’s access to f inanc ia l markets at reasonable 
spreads. I t i s assumed that spreads remain at 400 basis points over the medium te rm . This spread 
i s at the l e v e l observed in M a r c h 2005.

The public sector financing plan under the base case i s predicated o n issuance o f about 
US$450 m i l l i o n in bonds per year on average. Table 7 shows gross financing needs ( in teres t plus 
amortization obligations) estimated fo r the coming years. In te res t payments are estimated to 
remain at about US$0.7 b i l l i o n per year through 2005-10. Amortization payments are estimated 
at about US$1.2 b i l l i o n per year, except during 2006 and 2007, with amortization peaks o f 
US$1.7 and US$1.4 b i l l ion , respectively. These peaks are associated with repayments to the IMF 
o f US$0.7 and US$0.9 b i l l ion , and also to maturing bonds in 2006 o f US$0.6 b i l l ion .

Sens i t iv i ty analysis (Annex 2) shows that l im i t e d deviations f r o m the base case scenario 
are unlikely t o reverse the downwa rd projected p u b l i c debt path, but tha t larger slippages in 
performance c o u l d increase vu lne rab i l i ty significantly. F o r example, a primary su rp lus o f 3 
percent o f GDP, with a l l other base case assumptions unchanged, w o u l d resu l t in a p ro jec ted 
debt t o GDP r a t i o o f 67 percent in 2010, 7 percentage po in ts h ighe r than the 60 percent p ro jec ted 
under the base case but s t i l l a s ign i f ican t decline f r o m current levels. If, o n the other hand, 
med ium - te rm g r ow t h we re t o converge t o the h is to r ica l average o f 2 percent, then the p ro jec ted 
debt ra t io in 2010 w o u l d be 6 4 percent. This imp l ies a ce r ta in cush ion with regard t o the base 
case in terms o f debt sustainability. However, the margin f o r e r ro r i s l i m i t e d and the r isks 
increase commensurately with the extent o f the deviations. If, f o r example, f isca l performance

VI. TH E BANK’S ASSISTANCE PROGRAM 

A. CAS Objectives 

81. 
The B a n k Group’s assistance over the pe r iod covered by the CAS (FY05-10) proposes a 
strategic p rog ram o f lending and non-lending services to support the m a i n objective o f the new 
administration’s development plan “ E l Gobierno de Cambio - L a Transicibn Responsable ”, 

wh ich i s the attainment o f equitable and sustainable economic development. To attain this 

longer-term goal, the Government needs to mee t challenges in th ree broad areas: 

0 

reducing vulnerability; 
0 sustaining growth; and 
imp rov ing living standards. 

0 

82. 
The proposed Bank program responds to specific reques ts fo r support made b y the new 
administration t o help address some o f the key aspects o f the broad development challenges 
facing Uruguay. Reques ts fo r Bank support include tax reform, as well as f inanc ia l sector and 
capital markets development, ma in ly through technical assistance and development po l icy 
lending; the health sector, where Uruguay needs assistance in re fo rm ing the national health 
system, m a i n l y though an investment operation; education, where the Government i s look ing fo r 
continued support to expand full-time schools in marginal areas as well as management reforms 
in the education administration; in the area of 
innovation, where ma in ly technical assistance i s 
required t o re fo rm the existing ins t i tu t iona l set up and to design a national system o f innovation 
wh ich w o u l d p rov ide the basis fo r generating the required decision mak ing capacity in the 
country; the infrastructure andpublic services sector, bo th in the f o rm o f technical assistance to 
rev ise the current ins t i tu t iona l set up as well as investment in the areas o f transport, energy and 
water supply and sanitation, with a view to strengthen regulation and promote private sector 
participation; in agriculture and natural resources management, ma in ly through investment to 
promote the use o f integrated systems fo r natural resources management w h i c h are viable b o t h 
from the environmental as well as the economic standpoint, and w h i c h should provide a basis fo r 
the improvement of competitiveness in agricultural productivity; state modernization, with a 
view to redefining the ro le o f the state in order to enhance transparency, strengthen 
accountability and increase i t s operations efficiency. In the area o f private sector development, 
the Government seeks assistance in defining the ro le o f state financial institutions in the 
development o f capital markets, as well as the development o f a bus iness environment wh ich i s 
in l i n e with t h e country’s current requirements fo r productive investment. In the context o f the 
proposed technical assistance in this area, the Government i s also seeking Bank support fo r 
conducting studies o n the needed improvements in bankruptcy mechanisms. 

83. 
An overarching goal o f the Bank’s program i s to support the Government’s objective to 
increase social inc lus ion and reduce inequality. To this end, we w i l l : (i) support institutional 
strengthening for social inclusion, pa r t icu la r ly the newly established Ministry o f Social 
Development, the I n s t i t u t e o f Women’s A f f a i r s (IWA) and by creating mechanisms for N G O 
outreach; (ii) strengthen the analytical underpinning by bu i ld ing upon previous analytical work, 
such as the recently completed study o n social tariffs, and th rough regular poverty monitoring, 
inequality monitoring, and social analysis; and (iii) mainstream social inc lus ion and stakeholders 
analysis in to project design and implementation. F ina l ly , we w i l l mainstream throughout various 

33 

thematic in te rven t ions men t ioned above the comm i tmen t to strengthen outreach t o c i v i l society 
t o better engage stakeholders in the various r e f o rm and governance in i t ia t ives that w i l l b o t h 
requ i re p u b l i c support and invite p u b l i c accountability in order t o be successful. With regard t o 
reduc ing inequa l i ty , tax r e f o rm m a y p rove t o be an impo r tan t instrument. The n ew Government 
plans t o re - in t roduce a pe rsona l income tax f r o m a l l sources - cu r ren t ly o n l y wages and pensions 
,a re taxed. Depend ing o n deductions and exemptions, p rog ress iv i ty o f tax rates and e f fec t ive 
compliance, the new tax has the po ten t ia l o f im p r o v i n g equ i ty th rough taxa t ion . T h i s m a y be 
supported th rough the DPLs. In addition, the Government i s interested in reduc ing inequality in 
education and has asked the Bank f o r ana ly t ica l support.

Box 4: Findings o f the Client Survey 

T o better understand the ove ra l l s i tua t ion in U r u g u a y and h o w the Bank i s 
pe rce ived by i t s k e y in te r locu to rs and other stakeholders, t h e Bank comm iss ioned a 
comprehensive c l ien t survey o f k e y actors and o p i n i o n makers f r o m across the spectrum 
o f government, p r iva te sector, c i v i l society and academia. The Su rvey was conducted in 
June and July 2004. A t o t a l o f 256 people were asked t o respond t o the survey, o f w h i c h 
205, o r 80 percent, participated. 

I t i s impo r tan t t o no te t w o aspects o f the respondent group. First, respondents had

Salient findings emerged f r o m the survey. T h e f i r s t relates t o the country’s

encouraging responses. At the same time, however, the data ind ica te a clear challenge. 
The Bank was seen as m o r e effective in areas considered impo r tan t but o f re la t ive ly less

B. CAS Preparation Process and Lessons Learned 

85 . 

Several activities, engaging bo th the previous and the new administration in an active 
dialogue with the Bank, preceded the preparation o f the CAS and formed the basis fo r i t s 
recommendations and proposed program. 

86. 
Consultations. 
In late 2004 several participatory workshops were held fo r the 
preparation o f the Sources o f G row th report. In early December 2004, these events were 
followed b y a workshop in Montevideo where the Bank presented the findings o f the Sources o f 
G row th report t o representatives o f bo th the outgoing and the new administration. The workshop 
was hosted by the Central Bank Governor and included participation and comments by bo th the 
previous and the current M i n i s t e r s o f Finance. This event was fo l lowed by a two-day seminar in 
late January 2005 to discuss the findings o f the Policy Notes4 with the new Cabinet. The seminar 
was h igh ly participatory, and included several sessions dedicated to specific sectoral issues. The 
outcome o f the Po l icy Notes seminar was instrumental in establishing a close dialogue with the 
new authorities on key aspects o f the new Government’s program and in de f in ing the framework 
for ensuing Bank support. In addition, over the last couple o f months, a number o f technical 
missions visited Montevideo to ass is t the Government in better defining sectoral priorities and 
the needed actions fo r reforms in key areas o f the economy. In close cooperation with t h e 
authorities, the Bank intends to ensure that the preparation o f new operations, inc lud ing the 
proposed DPLs, i s based on a participatory and consultative process.

An impor tan t round o f C A S consultations was organized by the Bank in partnership with 

the Governmen t o f Uruguay, Fo ro Consultivo Econdmico Social del MERCOSUR, Seccidn 

Uruguuya (FCES). H a l f day- long meetings were he ld on A p r i l 19-21, 2005 in three areas o f the 
coun try with different characteristics: Montevideo, Paysandh and Tacuaremb6 (Annex 8). 

Participants: A l l meetings attracted a high number o f participants (more than 200 in 
total), with broad par t ic ipa t ion f r om the entire spectrum o f c i v i l society, inc lud ing NGO s and 
representatives f r om unions, 
fa i th groups, academia, workers’ organizations, producers’ 
associations, med ia and Government o f f ic ia l at the national, departmental and loca l leve l . 

Meetings’ Organization: A l l meetings were structured around a presentation on the ro le 
of the Bank and the m a i n objectives o f the CAS being discussed with the authorities. Fo l low ing 
the presentation, participants were divided in to break-up wo rk ing groups with a broad 
representation f r om var ious segments o f c i v i l society, and headed by a group leader, who reported 
the findings o f each group in a p lenary session. 

M a in Themes: There was a high l e v e l o f coincidence between the challenges fac ing 
U ruguay wh ich were identified in the C A S and those be ing singled ou t by the break-up groups. 
M a i n themes that emerged f r om the discussion were the need to deal with f isca l constraints and to 
strengthen the pub l ic sector. Participants emphasized the cost o f the cr is is in t e r m s o f loss of 
employment, pa r t icu la r ly fo r women, you th and other vulnerable groups, and no ted that the crisis 
had a severely negative impac t o n the country’s values, bo th at the f am i l y and at the ind iv idua l 
leve l . 

Perceptions of the World Bank: Overall, participants had ve ry limited in fo rma t ion about 
the ro le o f the Bank in the past. T o this end, participants we lcomed the fo r thcom ing opening o f a 
Bank’s resident m iss ion in Mon tev ideo . A number o f perceptions about the Bank emerged 
fo rce fu l ly throughout the consultations with c i v i l society representatives, inc lud ing a concern 
with the impac t o f the Bank ’s assistance. However, the re was a ve ry pos i t ive attitude towards 
deve lop ing a constructive dialogue with the Bank in the fu ture and towards an increase in Bank’s 
invo lvemen t . 

Proposals for Bank Engagement: C i v i l society we lcomed the oppo r tun i ty to collaborate 
with Government and the Bank in the recons truc t ion o f those values that were los t as a r e s u l t o l 
the crisis, and in ensuring that the needs o f the mos t vulnerable groups are addressed. The need 
fo r broader reforms in t h e ‘education sector, with the active invo lvemen t o f the teachers, was alsc 
iden t i f ied . W i t h respect t o the produc t ive sector, the scope fo r w ide pa r t ic ipa t ion o f the c i v i l 
society in the design and imp lemen ta t ion o f programs targeted at sma l l and medium enterprises, 
micro-enterprises and cooperatives was also h igh l igh ted . In the area o f state reforms, c i v i l soc ie t j 
wou ld welcome a future invo lvemen t in the mon i to r ing o f results ob ta ined by the pub l ic sector.

CAS Completion Report. T h e C A S Comp le t ion Repo r t (Annex 1) notes that the 
economic c r is is o f 2002 was an t ic ipa ted as a possible, a lbe i t n o t highly l i k e l y , risk scenario. The 
2000 C A S e x p l i c i t l y acknow ledged downs ide r i s k s o f “ a recess ion (or even mo re severe

w i t h d r aw t h e i r deposits f r o m U ruguayan banks. Yet, w h i l e acknow ledg ing the risk, the C A S did 
n o t propose any contingency plan t o deal with the l i k e l y dire consequences f o r U ruguay . In the 
absence o f a coun t ry -spec i f ic contingency plan the B a n k resorted t o a standard emergency 
lend ing ins t rumen t , the Special SAL, t o satisfy the u rgen t f inanc ia l needs o f U ruguay . A 
comb ina t ion o f S A L s and Special S A L s e f fec t ive ly enabled the B a n k t o con t r ibu te i t s share o f a 
US$3.8 b i l l i o n package o f support f r o m the IMF, the IADB and the Bank. However, the 
compressed repaymen t schedule o f the Special S A L w i l l create by i t s e l f and contribute, mo re 
generally, t o a hump in debt service in 2006 and 2007 w h i c h m a y comp l ica te the f inanc ing 
challenges f o r U ruguay and w h i c h might have been avo ided i f a l te rna t ive con t ingency plans had 
been prepared ahead o f t ime . The Gove rnmen t has requested cance l la t ion o f the rema in ing 
tranches o f the second S S A L (para. 89 ) . A lesson t o be learned, therefore, i s that, whenever 
serious downs ide r isks are present, advance consideration shou ld be g i v e n t o contingency 
planning and, idea l ly , f inanc ing t e r m s shou ld be compa t ib le and conduc ive t o advanc ing a robust 
debt sus ta inab i l i ty pos i t ion . 

88 . 

The C A S Comp le t ion Repo r t also notes h o w the Bank was able t o respond p r om p t l y and 
e f fec t ive ly t o the c r is is as i t unfolded. In pa r t that was possible because the B a n k h a d already 
assembled a b r o a d b o d y o f coun t ry experience th rough a diverse ope ra t iona l p rog ram and

long -s tand ing coun t ry p r o g r am c o u l d be m o b i l i z e d q u i c k l y t o assemble a n emergency p rog ram 
o f support f o r c r is is management. At the same time, a b road and deep coun t ry dialogue over 
many years, n o t o n l y with the Government, but also with the p r iva te sector, academia and c i v i l 
society was ins t rumen ta l in fos te r ing an e f fec t ive partnership with the c l ien t . Ano the r lesson t o 
be learned, therefore, 
i s tha t a strong corpus o f coun t ry know ledge and a strong c l ien t 
re la t ionsh ip shou ld be pursued as a prerequisite f o r the e f fec t ive de l ive ry o f emergency Bank 
assistance. S im i la r ly , a close coope ra t ion with other mu l t i la te ra l and b i la te ra l partners enhances 
the effectiveness o f the Bank ’s coun t ry p rog ram .

objectives o f imp rov ing equity and efficiency 
of public expenditures in the social sectors by 
supporting measures to imp rove management and give budgetary protection to p r io r i ty programs. 
The program to be supported by D P L l w i l l incorporate re fo rm progress in social policies over 
the last two years (based o n SSAL I1 tranche conditions that have a l l been met), and early but 
important measures the new Government has taken with respect to health, education and social 
protection. The D P L 1 also recognizes t h e resu l t achieved b y Uruguay o f protecting basic social 
indicators despite the severe impact o f the crisis on poverty and employment. The D P L l w i l l be 
presented to the Board together with the CAS. 

9 1. 
The proposed lend ing program comprises th ree additional programmatic Development 
Policy Loans in FY06-08. These operations are expected t o be multi-sectoral in focus and 
provide support to the Government in implementing reforms in the th ree key areas mentioned 
above, namely pub l ic sector management, financial sector reform, and re fo rm o f social 
programs. Potential programs within these th ree broad areas w h i c h cou ld be supported by the 
DPLs are presented in B o x 6. The specifics o f these programs wou ld be geared to respond to the 
corresponding development challenges presented in Section I V above. 

92. W i t h i n the pub l ic sector management area, the DPLs may focus o n tax reforms and 
e lemen ts o f the authorities’ expenditure management agenda such as pub l ic procurement and 
social trans fers . O n the tax front, the a im w i l l be essentially to imp rove equity o f the tax system, 
while on the administrative s ide the focus w i l l be o n imp rov ing tax collection, which i s essen t ia l 
to maintain the p r ima ry su rp lus . Regarding expenditure management, re fo rm o f social t rans fe rs 
are l ike ly to play a leading role. I t i s also possible that the DP L s may support some broader 
institutional reforms within the pub l ic sector. In the financial sector, i t i s expected that emphasis 
w i l l be on strengthening the ins t i tu t iona l framework for supervision, o n continuing state bank

c o u l d n o t be nego t ia ted and de l ive red as the allocations under the p rev ious C A S Progress Repo r t 
were exhausted. The n e w adm in is t ra t ion has c o n f i rm e d that these t w o operations are also 
consistent with i t s development p r io r i t ies . 

94 . 

T o support m o r e e f f ic ien t and accessible in f ras t ruc tu re systems, the B a n k plans t o assist 
the authorities with: (i) an In f ras t ruc tu re Inves tmen t p ro jec t tha t w o u l d address energy, security

A s agreed with the Government, the Bank p lans t o prepare an I n s t i t u t i o n Building 
operation (FY07) w h i c h i s expected t o assist in the des ign and imp lemen ta t ion o f ins t i tu t iona l

T o support im p r o v e d living standards, the B a n k i s w o r k i n g with the authorities o n 
investments t o support the Government’s r e f o rm o f the na t iona l h e a l t h insurance system through: 
(i) overhaul o f the regu la to ry f ramewo rk t o make i t m o r e e f fec t ive in p r o v i d i n g consumer

p rov id ing financing fo r necessary investment to expand the primary health care network o f the 
pub l ic system as i t wou ld requ i re significant modernization in the move towards a national health 
insurance and (v) de f in i t ion and implementation o f a health service delivery system that caters to 
the health needs o f the population, specifically imp rov ing the quality o f primary and secondary 
health prevention. As regards support to social security, the Bank i s prepared to assist the 
Government in considering options fo r pension reform, including l i n k i n g the replacement rate to 
the re t i remen t age. As regards support for education, the Bank i s prepared to assist the 
Government in imp rov ing the quality and equity o f the education system through a new lending 
operation wh ich could focus on continuing the Bank’s current support fo r t h e expansion o f full- 
time schools in impoverished areas. Further, the Government m igh t also seek support f i om the 
Bank in i t s efforts to re fo rm and modemize the administrative structure o f education 
administration. A further entry po in t may be reforms and changes o f the unemployment 
insurance and the family allowance program. 

97. 

Support fo r innovation, science and technology i s a h i g h p r io r i ty fo r the Bank program. 
The objective i s to help the authorities address the broad issue o f innova t ion as a driver fo r 
growth, thereby l i n k i n g innovation t o growing sectors in the economy. E f fo r ts to strengthen o f 
the national innovation system are likely to include support fo r the fo rmu la t ion o f an efficient 
po l icy framework with strong incentives. P r io r i ty wou ld be g iven t o strengthening the 
Government’s capacity to formulate a long-term po l icy v is ion supported by concrete po l icy 
measures wh ich wou ld also include drafting a strategic innovation plan. The process i s expected 
to invo lve stakeholders f r om several M i n i s t r i e s (including Finance, Education, Agriculture, and 
Industry) as well as representatives f r om industry. A related action area may invo lve fostering 
public-private linkages in the education sector. Grants and scholarships cou ld be provided to 
support: (i) cooperative research (support to research groups f r om universities, government 
laboratories, and private industry undertaking collaborative research and development, and 
research training in areas o f importance to industry); (ii) advanced graduate programs in p r io r i ty 
fields; and (iii) promoting ‘researcher in industry’ programs (expansion o f the stock o f high- 
quality personnel in Uruguayan industry by awarding scholarships to doctoral students who 
undertake a substantial part o f their thes is wo rk in industry). A third action area wou ld a im at 
enhancing agricultural competitiveness and trade by l ink ing the fundamental structural i s s u e s o f 
innovation, sanitation, and integration. This wo rk could build upon the Integrated Na tu ra l 
Resources Project. Add i t iona l action areas cou ld cover infrastructure and private sector 
development. 

98 . 

G ran t activities. The above lending program w i l l be supplemented by an active program 
in environmental management wh ich w i l l seek to leverage GEF and Carbon Fund resources to: 
(a) support regional grassland management (in a regional GEF-financed medium sized project 
shared with Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina); (b) improve so l id waste management, methane 
capture, and electricity generation, using carbon finance, bu i ld ing o n a successful p i l o t program 
nearing completion in Maldonado and potentially expandable in to Montevideo; (c) sequester 
carbon and reduce methane emissions using a combination o f planted forests and efficient 
livestock production systems; (d) and support t o urban transport operational efficiency gains and 
emissions reduction to help reduce transport-related carbon emissions. The above mentioned 

41 

assistance th rough GEF and Carbon Finance funds w i l l be additional to the assistance provided 
under the GEF-financed Integrated Ecosystem Management project, wh ich i s blended with the 
Integrated Na tu ra l Resources Project wh ich w i l l be presented t o the Boa rd together with t h e 
CAS. 

99 . 
In addition, support w i l l be given, possibly through t r u s t funds, to the implementation o f 
national environmental p r io r i t ies by Na t iona l Directorate o f Na tu ra l Resources o f the M in is t ry o f 
Agriculture and Na t iona l Directorate o f Environment o f the Ministry o f Housing, Land U s e and 
Environment in their shared and even overlapping capacities. A Statistics Support Grant has been 
requested t o p rov ide support to the Na t iona l Institute o f Statistics (INE). 

100. The program w i l l further be complemented by ins t i tu t iona l strengthening initiatives and 
grass-root capacity building activities financed f r om the IDF and other grant facilities. The 
proposed p r io r i t ies are t o use IDF capacity-building resources t o support (a) the new Ministry o f 
Social Development, w h i c h has the broad mandate o f fostering inc lus ion and lobby ing to reduce 
inequality across a wide range o f government programs and policies, and (b) NGOs and N G O 
networks actively supporting youth, afro-descendents, women and other socially excluded 
vulnerable groups. B o t h IDF and project funding (such as th rough the proposed Ins t i tu t ion 
Bu i ld ing Project) cou ld be specifically targeted to support the Government’s strategy o f mak ing 
social services more accountable and responsive to end-users by financing activities that promote 
voice and c l ien t power mechanisms. Specifically, support cou ld be given in such areas as (a) 
drafting and implementing the Ley Bdsica de Pa r t ic ipac idn Ins t i tuc iona l and (b) designing the 
Consejo ciudadano de seguimiento de 10s compromisos de gob ie rno . 

E. AAAandESW 

101. The Bank’s non-lending program (Table 8) aims to assist the Government in translating 
se lec ted development p r io r i t ies i n t o action agendas, underpin lend ing operations, and provide 
po l icy advice as requested. The proposed ESW program seeks to respond to evo lv ing 
Government p r io r i t ies in a flexible and agile manner so as to e f fec t ive ly contribute to the p o l i c y 
debate o n key development issues . We w i l l identify together with the authorities additional areas 
where the Bank i s well placed t o provide the Government with the needed analytical support. 
Furthermore, the Bank expects to increase i t s involvement in outreach activities wh ich w i l l foster 
c i v i l society pa r t ic ipa t ion and t o mainstream the use o f PS IAs as part o f i t s ESW program. 

102. A Public Expenditure Review (PER) and a Hea l th Strategy are ongoing and w i l l be 
discussed with the authorities in the near future. These s tud ies have a f isca l dimension, but also 
focus on the issue o f equity in access. The health and education chapter o f the PER include an 
incidence analysis, while the social protection chapter o f the PER and the recently concluded 
Po l icy Notes include the coverage rates o f major social programs among the poor. 

103. 
I t i s expected that trade w i l l b e an area where the Bank cou ld be potentially involved in 
p rov id ing the Government with the needed po l icy advice, and additional areas w i l l be discussed 
with the authorities in the coming months. The Bank w o u l d also consider p rov id ing advice to the 
Government in the imp lemen ta t ion o f the newly approved leg is la t ion o n anti-money laundering 
and combating the f inanc ing o f terrorism, upon reques t by the authorities. Clustering o f 
areadtopics under a s ing le piece o f ESW w i l l be one o f the guiding principles in the further 

42 

development o f the program. The ESW program currently includes in FY06, the completion o f 
the Update to t h e 2000 Country Procurement Assessmen t Report (CPAR), wh ich w i l l assess the 
impact o f procurement modernization actions since 2000 and w i l l identify possible f u t u r e 
initiatives. The FY 0 6 program w i l l also include the completion o f an Investment Climate 
Assessment, t w o Reports on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSCs) on insolvency and 
governance and a Financial Sector Assessmen t . The latter w i l l provide the new administration 
with a menu o f options fo r continuing the ongoing reforms o f the financial sector and the 
development o f capital markets. The Equity and Quality o f Education Economic and Sector 
Wo rk (ESW), also planned fo r FY06, w i l l analyze the degree to wh ich the current system o f 
assignment o f teachers and students contributes to maintaining inequ i t ies in the education system 
and w i l l explore options fo r increasing equality in education. 

104. Starting in F Y 0 6 and continuing on throughout the CAS period, the ESW program w i l l 
be articulated around programmatic multisectoral development po l icy reviews (DPRs). Each o f 
the DPRs w i l l f i r s t have a topical focus. A social sector DPR i s planned t o start in FY06 with 
particular focus on poverty and employment. A sectoral DPR in F Y 0 7 w i l l focus on 
infrastructure. In FY08, the planned DPRs w i l l focus o n agriculture and t h e environment. In 
addition to focusing o n a specific topic, the DPRs w i l l cover cross-cutting issues including fiscal, 
growth, social inclusion, social accountability and environmental management. In this way, the 
DPRs are expected t o provide the core analytical and safeguard framework fo r the DPLs, 
inc lud ing Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIAs). The PSIAs are expected to provide an 
analysis o f the distributional impact o f key reforms supported by the DPLs. The DPRs are further 
expected to provide a framework fo r poverty and inequality monitoring. This could include 
support fo r new survey wo rk o n ru ra l poverty. In addition to fo rma l ESW, some sector studies 
w i l l be conducted by the Government and the Bank in the context o f project preparation or 
implementation.

H. The Role o f IFC , M I G A and WB I 

IFC. 

110. 
IFC’s strategy f o r U r u g u a y f o r the last f e w years has been focused on the 
management o f i t s ex is t ing p o r t f o l i o , w h i c h was nega t ive ly a f fec ted in the aftermath o f the 
A rgen t ine crisis. A s s tab i l iza t ion and r e f o rm e f fo r ts advanced, IFC focused o n pu rsu ing 
opportunities t o support the p r iva te sector, pa r t icu la r ly in ac t iv i t ies tha t w o u l d he lp reactivate 
g r ow t h and increase exports. During this period, a p ro jec t o f U S $ 3 0 m i l l i o n in the agrobusiness 

45 

sector has been committed. The project i s for Conaprole, the National Cooperative o f Milk 
Producers and one o f the country’s main exporters. The project aims at enhancing the efficiency 
o f Conaprole’s operations and at helping i t to remain competitive in the wo r ld markets. The 
current po r t fo l io includes projects in the agrobusiness, education, infrastructure and finance 
sectors. 

11 1. Go ing forward, IFC’s strategy w i l l focus on supporting the expansion o f the private 
sector in areas where Uruguay i s internationally competitive and on selectively supporting 
private infrastructure and projects that facilitate access t o financing fo r second t i e r enterprises. 
Given the State relative strong presence in the infrastructure sector, I F C cou ld consider exploring 
opportunities under PPP schemes for sectors under wh ich the regulatory framework i s conducive 
and provides opportunities for I FC to add value to these projects. I t wou ld also explore 
opportunities that may a r ise through regional projects, e i the r at the Mercosur leve l or at the 
broader level. IFC’s pipeline currently includes projects in the export-oriented manufacturing 
sector. 

112. MIGA. MIGA’s activities in Uruguay have been concentrated in the financial sector 
until FY02. At that time, with the expiry o f existing contracts o f guarantee in the country. 
MIGA’s exposure to Uruguay risk disappeared f rom the Agency’s po r t fo l io . Du r ing FY05, 
MIGA has experienced a g row ing in te res t fo r guarantees for investments in Uruguay. This has 
resulted, thus far, in one contract o f guarantee covering the equity investments in the solid waste 
management concession awarded to a private operator in the c i ty o f Montevideo. In addition, 
MIGA i s currently examining other reques ts for guarantees, and expects to see an important 
increase in i t s exposure to Uruguay over the next couple o f calendar years. 

WBL 

1 13 , 
Du r ing the previous CAS period, approximately 300 representatives f rom 
Uruguayan government agencies, c i v i l society organizations, academia and the private sector 
participated in courses, conferences, GDLN (Global Development Learning Ne two rk ) dialogues 
and other learning programs offered by the W o r l d Bank Ins t i tu te (WBI). M u c h o f this 
participation was through global and regional programs. Training programs delivered in Uruguay 
included courses in infrastructure regulation and education reform. WBI w i l l support the new 
CAS objectives by continuing to include Uruguay in i t s various learning and capacity 
development programs t o be offered over the duration o f the CAS and w i l l attempt, wherever 
possible, to link these learning programs to ongoing and planned operational activities. In 
addition to the delivery o f learning activities, WBI w i l l provide support to the GDLN Center in 
Uruguay through i t s GDLN Services Unit.

V I I I . IMPLEMENTING THE CAS 

A. Expected Results o f the CAS 

Ind ica t ive outcomes and r e s u l t s indicators are presented in t h e annexed CAS Resu l ts 

118. 
Ma t r ix . Expected CAS outcomes as outlined in the Resu l ts M a t r i x w i l l be further refined as the 
required in fo rma t ion becomes available and could be subject to change. This w i l l be re f lec ted in 
the CAS Progress Report wh ich w i l l be prepared at the end o f the third year o f CAS 
implementation. The CAS Progress Report w i l l provide a preliminary stocktaking o f the program 
and the revised indicators w i l l reflect the status o f program implementation at that stage. A 
Client Survey w i l l also be ca r r ied out during the third year o f program implementation. 

B. Decentralization 

119. With the decentralization o f the Southern Cone Department and reactivation o f the Bank 
program in response to the crisis, the re has been a marked increase in v i s i t s o f the Country 
Director and other Bank staff to Montevideo. In addition, and w i t h the strong increased demands 
fo r Bank assistance, the Bank w i l l open a l ia ison o f f ice in Montevideo, effective mid-2005, 
which w i l l further enhance the dialogue and implementation o f the Bank’s program. 

C. Partnerships 

120. 
International Monetary Fund. Since liquidity problems were at the center o f the crisis in 
Uruguay, the IMF appropriately took a lead role in p rov id ing support f r om the international 
financial community. In Ma rch 2002, the IMF approved a Stand-by arrangement which, together 
w i t h a supplement in June of that year, amounted to US$2.8 b i l l ion . Financing was used to 
res t ruc tu re the banking system, strengthen f isca l performance t o assure medium-term debt 
sustainability and to foster private sector participation in basic services w i t h a view to imp rov ing 
productivity and efficiency. A l l of the reviews of the Stand-by arrangement proceeded well, 
albeit with some delays. Bank restructuring has been the most d i f f i c u l t issue to resolve, 
particularly the l iqu ida t ion of banks that had no prospect o f regaining financial v iab i l i ty . In 
February 2005, the IMF Boa rd approved the seventh and f ina l review. The ex-post assessment 
of the program was discussed by the IMF Boa rd o n Ma rch 18,2005. 

121, A new program with the IMF w i l l be crucial to ensure sustained macroeconomic stability. 
The Government has reached agreement with IMF staff o n a new th ree year Stand-by 
arrangement through mid-2008 wh ich i s expected t o be presen ted t o the IMF Boa rd in early 
June. IMF staff are proposing access under the new program to cover 60 percent o f repayments 
due over the program pe r iod wh ich amount to approximately US$1.9 b i l l i o n at current exchange 
rates. 

122. 
Inter-American Development Bank. Since the 1990s, the IADB has become the largest 
multilateral development partner t o Uruguay and has played a prominent r o l e in helping the 
country overcome the c r is is in 2002. The strategic framework fo r IADB’s assistance was 
articulated in a Country Paper covering the pe r iod 2000-2004. The Country Paper provided 
financing 
fo r a program o f US$1 b i l l i o n over the five-year period. An alternative scenario 
invo lv ing credits o f over US$1.2 billion was also foreseen in case t h e implementation o f 

49 

structural reforms aimed at sustained export-led growth within a framework o f macroeconomic 
stability and imp roved social equity required additional funds. That program was accelerated as a 
resu l t o f the 2002 crisis and, w i t h the approval o f a US$500 m i l l i o n loan fo r Social Protection 
and Sustainability in August 2002, overall lending exceeded the basic loan scenario. In 2003, the 
IADB approved additional commitments in the order o f US$260 m i l l ion , and in 2004 i t approved 
an additional U S 7 7 m i l l i o n fo r a Highway Infrastructure loan. 

123. A new Country Strategy fo r Uruguay i s currently under preparation fo r presentation to 
IADB Management’s Programming Committee in June 2005 and presentation to the Board o f 
Directors in the fou r th quarter o f the calendar year. Lending under the new program i s expected 
to be commensurate with Uruguay’s public financing needs wh ich include large repayments to 
IADB . 
124. Civil society. In implementing the CAS, we w i l l identify areas that w i l l assist the 
Government in bu i ld ing relationships w i t h c i v i l society. Du r ing the CAS consultations process, a 
number o f areas have been discussed. In the area o f social inclusion, c i v i l society could play a 
major role in ensuring that the needs o f the most vulnerable are addressed, and in education t h e 
active involvement o f teachers cou ld contribute to future re fo rm efforts. In addition, c i v i l society 
could ass is t the Government in designing and implementing programs fo r small and medium 
enterprises, micro-enterprises and cooperatives. In the area o f state reforms, c i v i l society could 
play a key role in mon i to r ing the resu l ts obtained by the public sector. 

D. Fiduciary Assessment 

125. The recently completed economic and sector wo rk in financial management and 
accounting indicates that the fiduciary environment i s Uruguay does no t presen t major issues, 
and that overall the country presen ts a l o w leve l o f fiduciary risk. However, more remains to be 
done in t e rm s o f imp rov ing some o f the procedural, institutional and legal aspects relating to 
both procurement and financial management. W i t h t h e completion o f a Country Financial 
Accountability Assessmen t (CFAA ) j o i n t l y w i t h the Inter American Development Bank (IADB) 
in 2003, and the planned completion of an Update to the 2000 Country Procurement Assessmen t 
Report (CPAR) in early FY06, the re are no gaps in core diagnostic ESW . Look ing forward, we 
w i l l address fiduciary issues systematically by more effectively integrating the recommendations 
o f the fiduciary wo rk in to the lending program. 

126. Procurement. A CPAR for Uruguay carried out in 2000 found no serious systemic 
problems affecting pub l ic procurement, and corruption was found no t to be an issue . However, 
the report identified a number of legal, institutional and procedural aspects that needed 
improvement. F rom the Bank’s perspective, procurement has been singled out in the past as one 
o f the areas o f delay and contention in portfolio management. The ma jo r shortcoming in the 
procurement area i s that the country lacks a national procurement law. The public procurement 
legal framework i s p rov ided by the Code o f Accounting and Financial Management (Text0 

Ordenado de Contabilidad y Administracidn Financiera or TOCAF), w h i c h i s a compilation o f 

provisions found in budgetary and financial laws. The procurement provisions in the TOCAF are 
very general and provide considerable latitude fo r interpretation. Consequently, harmonized 
procedures and documentation i s lacking. 

50 

127. 
In addition, the Court o f Audits (Tribunal de Cuentas) i s frequently a source o f delay for 
the procurement process. The Court does not have an ex-ante responsibility, but i s required to 
issue opinions o n procurement documents and decisions. Such opinions are no t mandatory, but 
are generally respected by the Executive Branch The Court i s required t o i s s u e i t s opinions 
within a specific and relatively short time frame, although through bureaucratic maneuvering 
wh ich o f ten take a long time, thereby disrupting the procurement process with limited value 
added. 

128. As a fo l low -up to the 2000 CPAR, an IDF Grant completed in FY 0 4 aimed at assisting 
Uruguay to imp rove the legal procurement framework, establishing an e-procurement system and 
conducting s ta f f training, concurrently w i t h complementary efforts supported by an IADB ’ s 
State Modernization project. Considerable progress has been made since the year 2000 on 
enhancing the institutional framework, establishing e-procurement in fo rma t ion and standard 
documentation fo r procurement o f goods, and staff training. The O f f ice o f Planning and Budget 
(OPP) has been assigned the lead ro le in public procurement. In addition, centralized systems fo r 
procurement o f medicines and food were established in the M i n i s t r y o f Economy and Finance 
(MEF) in 2003. Desp i te this progress, a national procurement law s ta l led in the National 
Congress. 

129. The Uruguayan Congress i s currently considering a b i l l to m o d i f y procurement 
legislation, inc lud ing new procedures which seek to increase the reduction in costs that the 
central administration has already experienced as a resu l t o f previous re fo rm efforts. Congress 
has made compliance with procurement laws a requirement for a l l public en t i t ies , which provides 
a significant legal mechanism fo r those outside the central administration. Some o f the 
noteworthy aspects o f this proposed l aw are as follows: (a) to promote e-procurement and the 
publication o f in fo rma t ion no t on ly with regard to specific procedures o n the Government’s 
website, but also framework contracts. This p e rm i t s a centralized procurement o some goods, the 
delivery o f which depends on the needs o f each executive unit; (b) a differentiation in 
procurement procedures bo th regarding the amounts invo lved as w e l l as fo r the specific types o f 
product that w i l l be purchased. This w i l l a l low fo r economies o f scale, however, i t should be 
borne in mind that competition may also be reduced; and (c) the introduction price l i s t s fo r 
procurement wh ich are continually updated b y the authorities. This wou ld a l low the traditional 
mechanism o f direct procurement t o be pa r t ia l ly replaced, and s t i l l provide a system o f 
permanent b idd ing fo r prices, o r at least generate a max imum reference price fo r purchases by 
the public sector. 

130. A CPAR Update currently under preparation and scheduled fo r completion in FY 0 6 i s 
intended to assess the impact o f procurement modernization actions since 2000 and t o review 
w i t h the new administration the possibility t o proceed with other initiatives, inc lud ing the 
enactment o f a national pub l ic procurement law, further strengthening o f the institutional 
capacity, the harmonization o f procurement practices in the central government institutions, the 
municipalities and state owned pub l ic u t i l i t ies , and rev iew ing the ro le o f the private sector. 

13 1. 
In particular, the Bank cou ld support Uruguay through techn ica l ass is tance to more f u l l y 
implement the modernization o f state purchasing. Fo r example, the SICE integrated purchasing 
system could be brought in to a more general use among the executive un i ts , or at least those 
w i th in the Central Administration. This wou ld facilitate the standardization o f procurement 

51 

procedures and comp l iance with the country’s lega l framework. Bringing S IC E i n t o general use 
also w o u l d p r o v i d e a guarantee o f compliance with procedural r u l e s , such as the ob l iga t ion t o 
publish on the webs i te and ensure payments by the State are recogn ized f o r purchasing. I t w o u l d 
also a l l o w f o r a more wide-ranging con t ro l o f the calls f o r bids and the “extension” o f such calls, 
an aspect tha t i s cu r ren t ly d i f f i c u l t t o con t ro l in Uruguay. Generalized implementation o f the 
system w o u l d also be use fu l fo r keep ing suppliers up t o date with their tax payments. 

132. Financial management. The latest C F A A prepared j o i n t l y with the IADB in 2003 
indicates that there are n o m a j o r concerns o n f inanc ia l management and accountability, and that 
in general p u b l i c sector financial management in U ruguay continues t o b e transparent, a lbe i t 
bureaucratic. Further, b a n k f inanced projects usua l ly receive u n q u a l i f i e d op in ions from ex tema l 
auditors and they are rece ived by the Bank in a timely manner. With respect t o the 2000 C A S 
ob jec t ive t o establish m o r e transparent accounting and budget processes, progress i s being made 
t ow a r d im p r o v i n g the transparency o f f isca l p o l i c y setting, budge t management and accounting, 
The qua l i ty o f f i s c a l data has substantially improved, performance o f the ope ra t iona l units o f the 
p u b l i c sector are m o r e c lose ly mon i to red . Howeve r mo re p roac t ive d issem ina t ion o f data o n 
budge t performance i s desirable. 

133. Several areas o f good p rac t ice were observed and inc luded : (i) an adequate lega l 
f ramewo rk f o r f inanc ia l accoun tab i l i ty ; (ii) clear d i v i s i o n o f the ro les o f the Execu t ive and 
Leg is la t ive Branches in terms o f f inanc ia l administration; (iii) comp le te and systematic revenue 
and expenditure classifications; (iv) budget execu t ion and con t ro l at a decentralized leve l ; (v) a 
mandate f o r the adop t ion o f in te rna t iona l ly accepted accoun t ing standards f o r the p u b l i c sector 
by end o f 2005; and (vi) t im e l y subm iss ion t o the Leg is la tu re o f the A n n u a l Consolidated Report 
o f Budge t Execu t ion . 

134. No tw i ths tand ing the cu r ren t economic c l ima te and ins t i tu t iona l arrangements govem ing 
p u b l i c expenditures, 
the C F A A conc luded tha t the e f f ic iency and transparency o f p u b l i c 
expenditures and financial management operations c o u l d b e im p r o v e d even fu r the r and the 
C F A A recommended a mix o f short t e rm and m e d i um t e r m actions t o suppo r t the fu r the r r e f o rm 
and modem iza t ion o f the state and im p r o v e governance. 

135. Overlaps in duties pe r fo rmed by the In te rna l Audit O f f ice , the De lega ted Accountants, 
the Cou r t o f Accounts, and the General A c c o u n t i n g O f f i c e and the onerous ex-ante controls 
pe r fo rmed by the Cou r t o f Accoun ts reduce the e f f ic iency o f these c o n t r o l func t ions and increase 
bureaucracy. During the C A S period, e f fo r ts w i l l be unde r taken t o m o b i l i z e W o r l d Bank 
Techn ica l Assistance and I n s t i t u t i o n a l Deve lopmen t grants as appropriate ins t rumen ts t o support 
the ra t iona l iza t ion o f the duties o f the va r ious c o n t r o l functions. 

E. Country Financing Parameters 

136. The new C o u n t r y F i n a n c i n g Parameters agreed with the Gove rnmen t are presented in 
Annex 7 . The Gove rnmen t has we lcomed the increased f l e x i b i l i t y tha t t h e n e w B a n k p o l i c y 
p rov ides with rega rd t o e l i g i b l e expenditures. However, the degree t o w h i c h the Government 
w o u l d l i k e t o use the increased f l e x i b i l i t y depends largely o n i t s strategy f o r funding 
development needs. T h e degree t o w h i c h the Bank w i l l use the increased f l e x i b i l i t y w i l l in tum 

5 2 

depend o n the Bank’ ove ra l l exposure, as well as the impact o n the Bank ’s ability t o fund other 
projects under t h e C A S and the po ten t ia l t o reduce transaction costs. 

137. 
In te rms o f cost sharing, the new parameters propose f l e x i b i l i t y for the Bank t o finance 
up t o 100 pe rcen t o f t o t a l p ro jec t costs, when this w o u l d resu l t in substantially reduced 
transaction costs and in a substantial impac t o n pove r ty a l lev ia t ion . In o the r cases, f l e x i b i l i t y in 
cost sharing w i l l depend u p o n the Bank’s ove ra l l lending envelope, and subject t o satisfactory 
ownership o f t h e o v e r a l l p rog ram and at the sector leve l . The Bank’s f inanc ing share o f 
i n d i v i d u a l p ro jec ts i s howeve r expected t o continue at current levels. 

138. W i th regard t o Bank f inanc ing o f recurrent costs, the n e w parameters propose no coun t ry - 
l e v e l limit, F r o m an economic perspective, sound f isca l management a n d the fac t that Bank 
financing i s fu l ly in teg ra ted in the budget and taken i n t o account in f isca l and debt targets 
ind ica te that 
f i n a n c i n g o f recurrent costs w o u l d n o t jeopa rd ize ove ra l l f isca l or debt 
sustainability. Therefore, no coun t ry - leve l limit o n recurrent cost f inanc ing i s proposed. From a 
p ro jec t perspective, f inanc ing o f recurrent costs under Bank p ro jec ts i s l ike ly t o continue t o take 
place o n l y in excep t iona l cases, a l though in the fu tu re increased f l e x i b i l i t y m a y be app l ied w h e n 
the re are special emergency and project-related circumstances. 

139. 
In te rms o f l o c a l cost financing, 
the requirements 
f o r Bank f inanc ing o f l o c a l 
expenditures are met, and the n e w parameters a l l ow f inanc ing o f l o c a l costs in the p r o p o r t i o n 
needed in i n d i v i d u a l projects. The change in p o l i c y i s n o t expected t o represent a m a j o r dev ia t ion 
f rom the p r e v a i l i n g p rac t ice in l o c a l cost f inanc ing in U ruguay , since the Bank has been 
financing substantial l o c a l costs in the past. With respect t o taxes and duties, the n ew f inanc ing 
parameters a l l o w the Bank t o finance a l l taxes and duties associated with p ro jec t expenditures 
with the excep t ion o f im p o r t t a r i f f s above 28 percent, w h i c h i s the average o f the Me rcosu r 
common ex te rna l t a r i f f . At the project-level, the Bank w o u l d also consider whether taxes and 
duties constitute a n excessively high share o f p ro jec t costs. 

F. IBRD Financial Products 

140. 
IBRD f inanc ing and r i s k management p roduc ts c o u l d p r o v i d e some needed f l e x i b i l i t y t o 
U ruguay t o manage i t s debt. This includes f l e x i b l e repaymen t te rms t o smooth the debt 
repayment p r o f i l e in order t o reduce r o l l o v e r risk and the p o s s i b i l i t y t o change the f inanc ia l 
characteristics o f IBRD loans t o better manage f inanc ia l r isks re la t ing t o currency, interest rate 
and commod i ty p r i c e v o l a t i l i t y caused by external factors. F o r i t s n e w IBRD loans, U ruguay has 
m o v e d t o the F i x e d Spread L o a n (FSL) but has n o t taken advantage o f the embedded r i s k 
management too ls i n c l u d e d in the FSLs tha t the Gove rnmen t c o u l d use t o manage currency, 
i n t e r e s t rate and r o l l o v e r r isks . Furthermore, U r u g u a y might want t o consider signing a Mas te r 
De r iva t ives Ag reemen t with IBRD, w h i c h w o u l d g i v e U r u g u a y access t o a range o f IBRD 
financial products tha t c o u l d h e l p the Gove rnmen t manage the interest rate and currency r isks o f 
i t s ove ra l l debt p o r t f o l i o . The C o u n t r y Managemen t Unit ( C M U ) i s ac t ive ly exp lo r ing with the 
authorities the i r interest in h a v i n g a B a n k team visit U ruguay in the near fu tu re t o better i l lus t ra te 
t o the authorities the ava i lab le IBRD f inanc ing and risk management products. 

141. The choice o f IBRD loans, guarantees and hedg ing p roduc ts might help manageheduce 
Uruguay’s vu lne rab i l i ty t o ex te rna l shocks, and c o u l d be app l ied t o both the p o r t f o l i o and at the 

53 

leve l o f ind iv idua l projects, bo th ongoing and in the pipeline. At the po r t fo l io leve l , we l l 
structured IBRD financial products could support Uruguay to better manage r i s k s inhe ren t in i t s 
debt. This cou ld be achieved through the use of: (i) traditional IBRD lending as needed; (ii) 
guarantees; and (iii) IBRD intermediation fo r long dated risk management tools. At the 
ind iv idua l project leve l , the Government w i l l be able to u s e flexible features embedded in IBRD 
loans along with IBRD risk management products and guarantees to max im ize developmental 
impacts o f certain programs by achieving the desired cost/risk structure o f certain existing 
projects or structuring more adequate financing for new ones. 

G . Risks 

142. Notwithstanding the satisfactory progress o f Uruguay in consolidating i t s economic 
recovery, a number o f important r i s k s must be acknowledged. Mos t important i s the risk 
associated with debt sustainability which, in turn, i s closely related to the dependency o f 
Uruguay upon events in neighboring countries, particularly Argentina. Uncertainty about the 
new administration’s ab i l i ty to deliver on i t s program o f reforms constitutes a po l i t ica l and social 
risk. There are also a number o f other r i s k s o f l e s s e r importance such as energy dependency. 

143. Po l i t ica l transition. Fo r the f i r s t time in 40 years, the FA -EP -NM r u l i n g coalition w i l l 
have an absolute ma jo r i ty in parliament. However, i t s majorities in bo th houses are small and the 
FA -EP -NM i s a broad coa l i t ion o f pa r t ies and movements ranging f r om the center l e f t to the 
radical l e f t . The President may therefore have d i f f icu l ty maintaining discipline within the 
coalition, especially when vo t ing o n controversial legislation. The opposition may also seek to 
exploit po l i t ica l differences within the F ren te Amplio and m igh t trumpet any inconsistencies 
between the coalition’s polices while in opposition and those in government. Lack o f 
cohesiveness within the coa l i t ion may also r e s u l t in po l i t ica l indecision. However, the President 
has been the undisputed leader o f the coalition fo r almost a decade and has proved to be capable 
o f exercising h i s power to se t t le internal d i f ferences and mediating between t h e coalition’s 
factions in the past. In addition, as President h e w i l l use h i s power of appointment to secure the 
support o f the different factions, and i s reaching out to a l l e lemen ts o f Uruguayan c i v i l society. 
This augurs well for keeping the Government’s program on track and reducing r i s k s o f po l icy 
slippage. This risk i s assessed as low . 

144. Social risk. The risk associated with the po l i t ica l transition also has a social dimension. 
The population has pa id a h i g h social p r ice fo r the crisis, inc lud ing unemployment and a 
reduction in real wages. The po l i t ica l transition has generated h i g h expectations among the 
population that urgent social needs w i l l be met. H i g h popular expectations have increased 
pressure on the Government to deliver qu ick ly on i t s program. There i s therefore a social risk 
associated with the fact that the authorities may no t be able to deliver o n their program as 
qu ick ly as the pub l ic expects, o r in a manner that mee ts popular expectations. Particularly 
important, employment and rea l wages could lag behind economic growth. The r e s u l t could 
engender social discontent. As was the case with the December 2004 referendums, popular 
sentiments could drive the Government’s decisions in key areas o f the re fo rm program. This risk 
i s assessed as moderate. 

145. Debt sustainability Debt sustainability w i l l continue to be a ma jo r issue fo r economic 
management in the medium t e r m notwithstanding the successful debt restructuring o f 2003 

54 

wh ich provided r e l i e f f r om liquidity pressures over the short and medium t e rm . The ratio o f 
pub l ic debt to GDP i s estimated to stand at about 90 percent at end-2004 and heavy 
amortizations due in the pe r iod 2006-07 constitute a potential threat to liquidity. Mos t o f those 
obligations a re due to multilateral financial institutions, particularly t h e IMF. Uruguay w i l l need 
to rely upon continued support from the international financial institutions and access to financial 
markets at interest rates commensurate w i t h i t s economic g row th prospects. The debt 
sustainability risk i s currently assessed as high, but expected to decline over time provided the 
Government can sustain strong macroeconomic and structural po l ic ies . 

146. Three factors that heavily in f luence debt sustainability are economic growth, fiscal 
policy, and the rea l exchange ra te (Annex 2). Growth improves debt sustainability b y increasing 
resources available to finance the public debt. Sustained growth o f at least 3 percent i s targeted 
under the base case. There i s a risk that slippage in the structural re fo rm agenda or additional 
external shocks could jeopardize growth and thereby undermine debt sustainability. Fiscal 
policy, in particular a significant primary su rp lus , contributes directly to debt sustainability b y 
reducing the Government’s bo r row ing requirement. Under the base case, a sustained primary 
surplus at or above the l e v e l achieved in 2004 i s targeted. Ma in ta in ing the primary su rp lus at 
t h i s level w i l l requ i re disciplined expenditure control wh ich may prove d i f f icu l t . The post-crisis 
fiscal adjustment has largely depended upon restraining nominal wages and wage-indexed 
pensions wh ich w i l l n ow be subject to upward pressure . Ach iev ing the primary su rp lus target 
w i l l hinge o n structural reforms in tax, pensions, health, and state modernization, as well as in 
infrastructure and public services to support private sector participation-thereby 
reducing 
pressure on the pub l ic investment budget. Experience indicates that these reforms are not easy to 
implement in any country. Finally, debt sustainability in Uruguay i s sensitive to the path o f the 
real exchange rate given the large share o f public debt denominated in foreign currency. As 
demonstrated by the c r is is , a sharp drop in the value o f t h e peso can dramatically increase the 
domestic currency value of Uruguay’s external debt. Under the base case, the peso i s projected 
t o appreciate moderately in concert with sustained economic recovery. However, this w i l l 
depend not on ly o n credible macroeconomic policies but also on structural reforms to improve 
the investment climate, thereby sustaining g row th and attracting capital in f lows . 

147. 
IBRD exposure. The to ta l o f IBRD debt outstanding and disbursed stood at US$785 
m i l l i o n at end December 2004, and Uruguay’s share o f the to ta l Bank po r t fo l io was 0.7 percent. 
That compares with an average o f 0.5 percent throughout the n ine t ies . W h i l e a small share o f the 
po r t fo l io in relative terms , Uruguay’s per capita exposure i s the third highest in the Bank. This 
j u s t i f i e s close monitoring. Recent lending included two special SALs in 2002 and 2003 in the 
amounts o f US$15 1.5 m i l l i o n and U S $ l O l m i l l i o n respectively, under w h i c h a total o f US$177.5 
m i l l i o n has been disbursed. The shorter amortization o f those special SALs w i l l cause a 
bunching o f payments that w i l l need to be carefully managed. With good macroeconomic 
management and reform, this risk i s assessed as moderate; under deteriorating macroeconomic 
conditions this risk wou ld be assessed as h igh . 

148. Regional shocks. Uruguay i s exceptionally vulnerable to shocks emanating f rom 
neighboring B raz i l and Argentina - particularly t h e latter. I t was the crisis in Argentina that 
triggered events in Uruguay du r ing 2001-02. Generally speaking the economic performance of 
Uruguay tracks that of Argentina quite closely. I f the re were to be a serious setback to the 
recovery currently under way in Argentina, the re i s likely to be a pa ra l le l setback in Uruguay, 

55 

a l though n o t necessarily o f the s am e magnitude. 
In the last couple o f years, U r u g u a y has 
d ive rs i f ied i t s expo r t markets and that w i l l reduce i t s vu lne rab i l i ty . Whereas B r a z i l and 
A rgen t ina used t o account f o r 50 percent o f Uruguay’s exports they n o w amoun t t o o n l y 30 
percent. In add i t ion , the U n i t e d States became U ruguay ’s la rges t expo r t ma rke t in 2004, 
accounting f o r one fifth o f expo r t sales. Furthermore, U r u g u a y has already e f fec t ive ly adjusted 
t o accommodate m a n y o f the n e w post-crisis realities and tha t w i l l fu r the r reduce i t s dependence 
u p o n n e i g h b o r i n g countries w h i c h have ye t t o make the adjustment. U n d e r cond i t ions o f reg iona l 
growth, th is r i s k i s assessed as moderate, but w o u l d increase t o high we re g r ow t h in A rgen t ina t o 
fa1 ter . 
149. Energy security. U ruguay i s dependent u p o n A rgen t ina f o r i t s supply o f energy, 
pa r t icu la r ly e lec t r ic p ow e r and na tu ra l gas. In ea r ly 2004, Argentina, con f ron ted with a domestic 
energy shortage, reduced the supply o f e lec t r ic i ty and na tu ra l gas t o ne ighbo r ing countries 
i n c l u d i n g U ruguay . Tha t experience underscored the vu lne rab i l i ty o f U ruguay . The B a t l l e 
Government responded by seeking t o d ive rs i fy the sources o f supply, a n d there i s cu r ren t ly an 
agreement in p lace t o im p o r t energy f rom B raz i l , a l though th is appears t o b e temporary. 
Therefore, ene rgy dependency i s a po ten t ia l source o f r i s k w h i c h c o u l d threaten economic 
recove ry i f supplies we re t o be interrupted. The new Gove rnmen t i s aware o f t h i s r i s k and i s 
w o r k i n g t ow a r d m o r e secure energy supply. This r i s k i s cu r ren t ly assessed t o be high.

Summary 

T h i s document contains an eva lua t ion o f coun try developments in U ruguay and the respective contributions 
o f the government and the Bank during the pe r iod o f the previous C A S (FY00-FY05). 

The 2000 C A S was w r i t ten at a t im e when, after a decade o f steady grow th , i t appeared tha t Uruguay w o u l d 
soon be e l ig ib le f o r graduation f r om B a n k lend ing . As a f i r s t step towards graduation, the 2000 C A S 
proposed a l e v e l o f Bank lending that was about h a l f o f the prev ious C A S p e r i o d program . The proposed 
lend ing p rog ram was t o b e based o n three pillars: 

Pover ty reduc t ion and soc ia l equity 
Env i ronmen ta l and na tura l resource management 
The r o l e o f the s ta te as an engine o f g r ow t h 

A t end-200 1, less than h a l f way th rough the C A S per iod , ne ighbor ing Argen t ina was t h r ow n in to a deep 
cr is is and de fau l ted o n i ts pub l ic debt after a deva lua t ion o f i t s currency t o one third o f i ts prev ious value. 
The crisis q u i c k l y spread t o U ruguay where, in 2002, GD P f e l l by 11 percent, unemp loymen t rose t o a peak 
o f almost 19 percen t - the highest l e v e l in twen ty yea rs - and pove r ty peaked at 3 1 percent in the last 
quarter o f 2002. 

The response o f the government was p r om p t and p u r p o s e h l . I t t o o k the in i t ia t ive t o renegotiate the t e rm s 
o f the p u b l i c debt w i t h creditors and reached an accommodation that p r o v i d e d Uruguay w i t h medium-term 
debt re l ie f . I t t o o k decisive measures t o establish f isca l discipline, t o restructure the f inanc ia l sector and t o 
take other measures to stabilize the situation. 

A C A S Upda te Repor t o f 2002 proposed an increase in f inanc ia l support f r om the Bank as pa r t o f a 
comb ined p rog ram o f support a long w i t h the IMF and the IDB t o h e l p Uruguay overcome the crisis. 
S truc tura l Adjustment L e n d i n g and Special S A L S were proposed as the pre ferred veh ic le f o r Bank support. 
A l t h o u g h the m e d i um te rm v i s i o n con t inued t o f o l l ow tha t ou t l ined in the 2000 CAS , p r io r i t ies and lend ing 
instruments were t o be changed t o better re f lec t the immed ia te needs o f t h e country. 

~ 

This C A S comp le t ion repo r t concludes tha t the government was successful in s tab i l iz ing the s i tua t ion and 
tha t the Bank, together w i t h other in terna t iona l f inanc ia l institutions, con tr ibu ted t o tha t success by 
adapting their coun t ry assistance programs appropriately. Hence, changes in the coun try assistance strategy 
proposed in the 2002 C A S Upda te Repo r t were successful in he lp ing U ruguay recover f r om the economic 
crisis and pos i t ion i t s e l f better f o r sustained g row th and pove r ty reduc t ion . As t h e resu l t o f an augmented 
B a n k engagement b o t h at the opera t iona l l e v e l and a t the leve l o f ana ly t ic and adv isory services, the 
government was be t ter able t o keep s i g h t o f longer- term development issues no tw i ths tand ing i t s 
preoccupation w i t h cr is is management.

O n social issues , the president expressed concern that many low-income f a m i l i e s 
were congregating in squatter settlements fo r lack o f alternative housing opportunities 
and he proposed that the government supply them with housing s i tes furnished with basic 
services o f water, sanitation and electric power upon wh ich they may build more better 
quality hous ing within a secure legal framework. H e also made special mention o f t h e 
need to expand pre-school educational facilities, particularly fo r low-income groups. 

The Bank’s program o f support 

Bank support fo r the long-term development goals o f the government was 
constrained by strategic considerations o f program size and structure. First, the Bank 
perceived U ruguay as a country that was approaching the e l ig ib i l i ty threshold fo r 
graduation f r om Bank lending. Although, at the time o f preparing the 2000 CAS, 
Uruguay was already experiencing a recession, the recession was perceived to be a 
temporary in te r rup t ion that did no t appear t o threaten the very rea l gains o f steady g row th 
during the preceding decade. The Executive Summary o f the 2000 CAS noted that the 
country’s per capita income was already 20 percent above the Bank’s indicative threshold 
fo r in i t ia t ing graduation and concluded that “Given Uruguay ’s relatively high level of 
social and economic development, the time has come to consider a g radua l reduction in 
support, reflecting the evolving nature of Uruguay’s development challenges and the 
Bank’s ro le ”. Second, the CAS document noted that the In te r -Ame r ican Development 
Bank had been and s t i l l remained the ma in source o f external finance fo r Uruguay and, 
hence, the Bank did no t have a lead ro le in external assistance. As a r e s u l t o f those two 
considerations, the 2000 CAS proposed a 50 percent reduction in lending to Uruguay, o n 
a commitments basis, compared with the previous 1997 CAS . That proposal was also 
broadly consistent with the findings o f an International Financial Ins t i tu t iona l Advisory 
Commission w h i c h had been established by the U S Congress under the chairmanship o f 
Alan Meltzer. The report o f the Commission, issued in M a r c h 2000, recommended that 
the W o r l d Bank and other similar development banks should lend l e s s to countries that 
have access to the international financial markets and focus more o n low-income 
countries with l i t t l e capital-market access. 

Subject, as i t was, to a strategic constraint o f p rog ram size, the CAS had to be 
much more selective in i t s support fo r t h e government’s development agenda as 
compared with t h e past. 
I t was decided that the base-case lending p rog ram o f US $ l 5 0 - 
200 m i l l i o n fo r FY01 -05 should include “selected investment lending in areas where 
there is an important soc ia l o r environmental dimension, and the Bank’s international 
knowledge wou ld be c ruc ia l t o p ro jec t success ’I. In addition, “advisory and analytic 
services (would) be used t o guide the selectivity of 
the lending pipeline, and to maintain 
an open po l icy dialogue w i t h the government. 
I t w o u l d also serve as background 
preparation in the eventuality that a h igh case lending scenario is t r igge red . ” A h i g h 
case scenario w o u l d have boosted lending to US$200 m i l l i o n and w o u l d have included 
adjustment lending fo r financial sector or other c r i t ica l re fo rm areas.

Mindful o f the development objectives established by the B a t l l e adm in is t ra t ion

Poverty reduction and soc ia l equity were t o be fostered with investments in 
education, health, commun i ty development and soc ia l in f ras t ruc tu re such as 
wa te r supp ly and sanitation. In parallel, an amb i t ious p r o g r am o f analytic and 
adv iso ry w o r k was envisaged i n c l u d i n g a mu l t i -phased p o v e r t y assessment, a 
hea l th p o l i c y no te and an assessment o f social expenditures. 
Environmental and natural resource management we re t o be enhanced 
with investments in ma r i t ime management and r u r a l deve lopmen t together

The r o l e o f the state as an engine o f growth and i t s re la t ionsh ip t o p r iva te 
sector development was t o be examined in the con tex t o f a substantial 
p r o g r am o f ana ly t ic and adv iso ry w o r k in issues o f trade and competitiveness 
as w e l l as f inanc ia l sector structures. E f f i c i e n c y was t o b e enhanced and, at 
the same time, the prospects f o r graduation f r o m Bank l e n d i n g were t o be 
advanced with investments in p u b l i c enterprise re fo rm .

Bank’s selective p rog ram o f support p robab ly l a y in a l ow e r l e v e l o f Bank lend ing f o r

with social sector investments in education, hea l th and c omm u n i t y development 
constituted the core o f the program, consistent with the government’s ow n objectives in 
those areas. 

The Onset o f Crisis and the Management o f Crisis 

H a l f w a y th rough the p e r i o d cove red by the 2000 CAS , there was a rad ica l and 
unexpected reversal in the s i tua t ion o f U r u g u a y w h i c h caused b o t h the government and 
the Bank t o fundamentally reassess the en t i re p rog ram o f coun t ry assistance. F o l l o w i n g 
u p o n a decade o f mac roeconom ic s tab i l i ty and steady g r ow t h during the nineties, 
U ruguay su f fe red a recession in 1999 and then co l lapsed i n t o a deep econom ic c r is is in 
2002 w h e n ne ighbo r ing A rgen t ina de fau l ted o n i t s p u b l i c debt and deva lued i t s currency

continuity enabled the government to manage proactively the economic situation and to 
mob i l ize an ‘already long-established social safety n e t t o cushion poverty. Concerted 
support f r om the international financial community was also an important factor in 
assisting the government to cope with a d i f f icu l t adjustment. 

Among the strong adjustment measures undertaken by the government in 
response to the crisis, the fo l low ing were especially important in stabilizing the economy:

0 Fiscal adjustment was at the center o f Uruguay’s response to c r i s i s 
management. Public utility prices were qu ick ly adjusted to reflect new 
financial realities even though the scale o f the adjustment needed was 
substantial. In 2003, t h e post-crisis year, the government achieved a primary 
fiscal s u r p l u s equivalent to 2.7 percent o f GDP. That represen ted an 
improvement o f 3.9 percentage points when compared with a 1.2 percent 
p r ima ry fiscal de f ic i t in 200 1, the pre-crisis year. 
The 2002 crisis had a profound effect upon the monetary and exchange rate 
po l icy o f Uruguay. The f i r s t response o f the Central Bank was t o accelerate 
the depreciation o f the Uruguayan peso within the framework o f the same 
c raw l ing peg mechanism that had prevailed in previous years. However, as 
p ressu re mounted o n the Uruguayan peso the Central Bank abandoned the 
c raw l ing peg altogether and allowed the currency t o f loa t in June 2002 The 
r e s u l t was a further sharp f a l l in the real effective exchange rate before i t 
stabilized later in the year. 
Devaluation made i t fiscally impossible to service the pub l ic debt most o f 
wh ich was dollar-denominated. The government took a b o l d in i t ia t ive to 
negotiate with bondholders a refinancing o f sovereign debt. Bondholders 
recognized that Uruguay’s banking and debt problems were largely due to 
contagion f r om the crisis in Argentina. They were receptive to refinancing to 
avo id the government being pushed in to a situation where default may be the 
on ly alternative. The perception that the government was implementing a 
sound 
fiscal and structural re fo rm program was also an 
important 
consideration f o r creditors. The outcome o f the negotiations was a debt swap 
that permitted Uruguay to lengthen the ma tu r i ty o f i t s sovereign debt over five 
years w i thou t ra is ing interest rates and with no reduction in principal. The 
international f inanc ia l markets were reassured by the successful outcome and 
the country risk premium fo r Uruguay f e l l f r om 1800 basis points to i t s 
current l e v e l o f 600 basis points. 
The decision o f neighboring Argentina, in December 2001, to freeze bank 
deposits and restrict capital outflows prompted a run o n Uruguayan banks for 
fea r that Uruguay may take similar action. To ta l deposits o f the non-financial 
private sector in the bank ing sys tem f e l l by 50 percent in t h e course o f 2002. 
The government then sought assistance f r om the IMF, the World Bank and the 
IDB fo r a p rog ram o f structural re fo rm aimed at safeguarding the financial 
system w i thou t channeling unnecessary support to institutions that had 
become inso lven t and had l i t t l e prospect o f regaining f inanc ia l v iab i l i ty . Four 
insolvent commercial banks were closed and their residual po r t fo l ios o f

The Bank’s support f o r crisis management 

A C A S Progress Repo r t was prepared in July 2002. I t i s t o be interpreted within 
the context o f a broader e f f o r t by the in te rna t iona l f inanc ia l c omm u n i t y t o assist U ruguay 
at a t im e w h e n the econom ic s i tua t ion was de te r io ra t ing rap id ly . The full dimensions o f

scenario was n o longe r appropriate and concluded: 
“The situation now calls for 
additional support to assist Uruguay to weather the cu r ren t c r is is and to continue the 
program of reforms c r i t i c a l to a more competitive economy wh i le maintaining investment 
in human cap i ta l and reinforcing measures to p ro tec t vulnerable groups ”.

Uruguay during the crisis period. The revised program outlined in the 2002 CAS 
progress report covered a truncated pe r iod FY03-04 compared with the FY00-05 program 
o f the o r ig ina l CAS. The shortening o f the program ho r izon to tw o years i s significant 
because i t indicates h o w the Bank perceived the situation in U ruguay to be fluid. The 
rev ised objectives o f the 2002 CAS update report were characterized as fo l lows : 

“The updated Bank strategy focuses on pu rsu ing the 2000 CAS agenda, but 
w i th in a crisis environment. The revised p rog ram targets three broad objectives 
corresponding to the main challenges facing Uruguay, namely: (9 Jiscal sustainability 
and adjustment, ( i i) increasing competitiveness; and, ( i i i ) social protection. I n each area 
the Bank p rog ram offers f inanc ia l and technical support, in concert w i t h our major 
partners, the IMF and the ID B . ” (para. 47) 

A l though the 2002 CAS Progress Report sought to p rese rve the threefold long 
t e rm objectives o f the 2000 CAS, b o t h the government and the B a n k we re preoccupied 
with managing an economic crisis o f major proportions during the remaining years o f the 
program. The threefold organizational framework o f the 2000 country assistance strategy 
remained in place but p r io r i t ies were radically changed and alternative lending 
ins t rumen ts were chosen to better reflect the requirements o f a crisis environment. The 
updated program and the revised country assistance strategy can be presented along the 
fo l low ing l ines :

Poverty alleviation was to focus o n measures fo r cushioning the impact o f 
increasing poverty induced by unemployment and by other effects o f the 
economic crisis. Qu ick disbursing finance was t o be p rov ided through 
structural adjustment loans with conditionality exp l ic i t ly protecting budgetary 
support fo r important social programs at a t ime o f exceptional fiscal 
constraint. At the same time, the Bank’s ongoing operational presence in the 
health and education sectors became even more re levan t in dealing with the 
broader social consequences o f the crisis. Progress secured b y those 
operations was to be protected with support f r om a Special SAL. 

Env i ronmen t and n a tu r a l resource management became an issue o f urgent 

concern when Uruguay was a f f l ic ted with an outbreak o f foo t and mou th 
disease w h i c h threatened the national he rd and resulted in a suspension o f b e e f 
exports, thereby further deepening the economic crisis. The Bank response 
was to put together a Foo t an M o u t h Disease Emergency Recovery Loan in 
support o f a containment and recovery plan that w o u l d reinstate the sanitary 
status o f the national he rd o n a sustainable basis and thereby enable Uruguay 
to regain access to export markets and re-activate l ives tock production. 
Previously envisaged longer-term plans such as imp rov ing the management o f 
ma r i t ime and coastal resources were put o n the back-burner pending a 
resolution o f the p reva i l ing economic crisis. 
The ro le o f the state became an even more pressing i s s u e as a resu l t o f the 
crisis. In that context, however, the p r io r i ty objectives were to stabilize the 
economy and recover the l e v e l s o f production that had been lost. At the same 
time, i t was recognized that structural weaknesses, pa r t icu la r ly in the financial

sector, the pub l ic en te rp r ise sectors and in fiscal management wou ld need to 
be remedied in order fo r the economic recovery to rema in securely in place 
and se rve as an effective foundation fo r sustained g row th in the future. 
Structural adjustment lending was t h e ins t rumen t o f choice fo r pursuing those 
objectives and the strong program o f analytic w o r k envisaged under the 2000 
CAS facilitated the task o f putting together a to ta l o f tw o SALS and two 
Special SALS. 

In summary, the period covered by the 2000 CAS encompassed two quite 
separate and distinct country assistance strategies in response t o a radical change o f 
country circumstances. 
f i r s t strategy was predicated upon a measured 
disengagement o f the Bank in preparation for the eventual graduation o f Uruguay. The 
second strategy was based upon full re-engagement in concert with other donors to rescue 
Uruguay f r om an unforeseen crisis. At the same time, i t was apparent that the crisis had 
revealed fundamental weaknesses and vulnerabilities in the Uruguayan economy such 
that graduation f r om Bank lending wou ld need to be postponed fo r the foreseeable future.

housing program targeted to poo r households in ru ra l areas which, 
in 2000, the 
government complemented with a similar program targeted to urban s l u m dwellers. The 
overall effectiveness o f programs fo r poverty alleviation was eroded, however, b y 
g row ing fiscal constraints wh ich caused social spending to respond p ro -cyc l ica l ly during 
the pe r iod 1998-200 1. 

The severity o f the ensuing economic crisis was such that a significant increase in 
poverty was unavoidable in Uruguay notwithstanding the existence o f a long-established 
social safety ne t . F o l l ow i n g upon th ree years o f recession, GDP f e l l by 11 percent in 
2002. Unemployment rose to a peak o f almost 19 percent - the highest l e v e l in twenty 
years - and poverty peaked at 3 1 percent in the last quarter o f 2002. 

The government responded p romp t ly and decisively to even ts as they unfolded 
with substantial support f r om the international financial community. In August 2002 the 
IM F , the Bank and the IDB announced that the th ree institutions w o u l d pledge a total o f 
US$3.8 b i l l i o n in support o f Uruguay. Within that envelope, the Bank was proactive in 
ass is t ing the government to adapt i t s policies and programs o f social protection. Bank 
analytic work, including a report en t i t led “maintaining Social Equity in a Changing 
Economy”, provided valuable insights and pointers for structuring government action 
more effectively and e f f ic ien t ly . In July 2002, based in part upon that analysis, the Bank 
approved a Special SAL in support o f a broad range o f government action inc lud ing the 
fo l low ing : 

0 Budget allocations fo r protected social programs in 2003 we re t o be n o lower 
that the 2002 budget allocation. Thereby, and end was put to the p ro -cyc l ica l 
trend o f social expenditures f r om 1998-2001 and the social safety ne t was 
made more e f fec t ive . As a resu l t o f this provision, the ove ra l l budget

budget execution at the ind iv idua l program l e v e l was uneven. Food programs

In the hea l th sector, where the H e a l t h Sector Deve lopmen t Project had been 
closed the p rev ious year, the second Special SAL supported government e f fo r ts t o press

Progress with respect t o the education sector and hea l th sector re fo rms supported 
by the second Special SAL was ve ry good and, o n tha t basis, the second and third 
tranches we re ready f o r release in 2004. Howeve r , w h e n the second Special SAL was 
app roved in 2003, a dec is ion was made t o c ross - l ink the release o f the second and third 
tranches with the corresponding tranches o f a second SAL tha t h a d rece ived B o a r d 
app rova l o n the same date. Progress with the second SAL was m u c h s lowe r than had 
been an t ic ipa ted and, because o f the cross-linkage, release o f the second and third 
tranches o f the second Special SAL was held-up. By 2005, i t became clear that U ruguay 
had already emerged f r o m the economic c r is is and fu r the r f inanc ia l assistance o n Special 
SAL terms was n o longe r appropriate. Tha t p romp ted the government t o request

a n e w CAS w o u l d propose other mo re appropriate moda l i t ies f o r supporting the 
government’s p r o g r am o f soc ia l development. 

In conc lus ion i t i s clear that, at the depth o f the econom ic crisis, pove r ty outcomes 
were much wo rse than h a d been envisaged at the t im e o f the 2000 CAS o r even at the 
t im e o f t h e 2002 CAS Update. Howeve r , in the case o f a sm a l l coun t ry such as Uruguay,

government by consensus. 
I t was clearly understood that the most effective way o f 
reducing poverty was to get the economy back o n i t s fee t again. Macroeconomic po l icy 
was, therefore, at the forefront o f the f igh t against poverty and i t was strikingly successful 
in reversing the economic decline and fostering a rap id recovery. GDP grew at 11 
percent in 2004. At the same time, measures were taken to strengthen programs o f social 
protection and to ensure that other social programs in health and education were shielded 
f r om fiscal retrenchment to the extent possible. The Bank, in conjunction with i t s 
partners the IMF and the IDB effectively supported the government’s program for 
economic recovery and poverty reduction and qu ick ly saw the need to re-engage with an 
accelerated program o f lending together with analytic and advisory work. 

P i l la r 2: Environmental and na tu ra l resou rce management was the p i l la r 
most deeply affected by the crisis for two reasons. First, the government’s attention was 
focused sharply upon managing short t e r m issues o f stabilization and poverty r e l i e f . 
Acute fiscal constrains stood in the way o f funding longer-term projects such as the 
maritime management project that had been contemplated in the 2000 CAS program and 
i t was shelved m id -way through project preparation. Ongoing projects continued to be 
implemented but were delayed b y the crisis. 

A Na tu ra l Resources Management and I r r iga t ion Development Project, begun in 
1994 was already well o n the way to completion by the time o f the 2000 CAS but the 
f ina l tw o years o f project implementation p r io r to the end-2002 closing date were 
important for the sustainability o f the p r inc ipa l project objective w h i c h was to develop 
and implement a so i l and water management strategy focused o n the development o f 
i r r iga t ion with the in ten t ion o f increasing, d ive rs i fy ing and sustaining agricultural output 
and exports. The project ove ra l l was successful, and substantial progress was made 
towards achieving the p r inc ipa l and subsidiary development  objective^.^ 

A second event w h i c h rad ica l ly changed the focus o f the environmental and 
natural resource management CAS pillar was the outbreak o f a virulent epidemic o f foot 
and mou th disease (aftosa) w h i c h threatened the production and export o f bee f . Given 
the importance o f b e e f exports fo r Uruguay, the epidemic was a calamity that required an 
urgent response. Bank support f o r the government’s efforts at short-term epidemiological 
containment and at longer-term monitoring, surveillance and con t ro l took the f o rm o f an 
E P L in the amount o f US $ 1 8 . 5 m i l l i o n wh ich i s s t i l l ongoing. Epidemiological 
containment th rough vaccination was thorough and successful and t h e operation i s n ow 
focusing upon monitoring, surveillance and con t ro l systems.* 

The Bank has also been active in broader efforts to imp rove the environment by 
administering GEF grants aimed at fostering alternative energy in i t ia t ives . An i n i t i a l 
operation to capture methane that w o u l d otherwise be emitted f r om landfill waste and to 
harness i t for the p roduc t ion o f electric power has been successfully implemented and has 
excited the in te res t o f mun ic ipa l authorities throughout the country.

Pillar 3: T h e ro le o f the state as a n engine o f g row th was an important focus o f 
government action and o f Bank support for structural and po l icy re fo rm throughout the 
en t i re f i v e year pe r iod o f the CAS. However, the onset o f a deep economic crisis in 2002 
caused bo th the government and the Bank to reassess bo th the priorities and the 
modalities. 

At the beginning o f the CAS period and prior to t h e crisis, the Bank lending 
program was designed along l i n e s that reflected continuity. A single tranche financial 
sector adjustment loan in support o f already completed government re fo rms to increase 
efficiency and competitiveness in the financial sector was disbursed a few weeks after the 
incoming Ba t l le administration took office in March 2000. Shortly afterwards, the Bank 
submitted to the government analytic wo rk which contained a broad range o f 
recommendations fo r fo l low -up reforms to further strengthen the financial sector. 

Infrastructure and pub l ic services, wh ich are largely in the hands o f the state, also 
received Bank support. In June 2000, bu i ld ing upon a long-standing operational presence 
on the part o f the Bank, an Adaptable Program Loan was approved in support o f a 
program o f modernization and systems rehabilitation in water and sewerage. The 
progress o f this operation was set back b y the economic crisis o f 2002 wh ich negatively 
affected the financial pos i t ion o f OSE, the water and sewerage authority. S ince then, 
however, the situation has since improved and the operation i s progressing well. 
likely that a l l the o r ig ina l objectives w i l l be met by the time the loan closes in June, 2006 
and i t i s anticipated that subsequent APLs w i l l build upon the resu l ts achieved.’ 

I t i s 

Transport had been a ma jo r focus o f Bank support fo r infrastructure development 
in Uruguay and i t continued to receive attention during the 2000 CAS period. The 
implementation o f a Second Transport Project, approved in 1998, was made increasingly 
d i f f icu l t b y the recession of 1999 and the c r i s i s o f 2002 because the road sector budget 
was cut back severe ly . Nevertheless, the Implementation Completion Report was able to 
record a satisfactory outcome despite delays provoked by budget constraints. The 
operation increased efficiency in transport service and road maintenance and “thereby 
contributed to the rationalization o f transport sector expenditures. I t also removed some 
o f the bottlenecks to international transport and contributed to the preservation o f the 
road network, thus p rov id ing some o f the necessary conditions fo r the competitiveness o f 
Uruguay’s products t o increase, especially w i t h i n Mercosur”. lo 

Bank analytic w o r k indicated that a l l infrastructure and pub l ic services, inc lud ing 
water supply and sanitation, power, natural gas, petroleum products, railways, 
telecommunications and postal services, confronted similar issues o f organization, 
management, regulation, tariff structures and in fo rma t ion systems. The resolution o f 
those issues frequently depended upon the outcome o f su rveys and analytic studies wh ich 
sometimes could be complex. Technical assistance fo r that endeavor was furnished with 
Bank support under a Pub l ic Se rv ices Modernization Technical Assistance Project that

was approved in Ma rch 2001. The project i s progressing w e l l and i t has already helped 
the government achieve significant improvements in the efficiency o f state-owned 
infrastructure and public services. l1 

“Bus iness as usual” was abruptly interrupted at the end o f 2001 when neighboring 
Argentina devalued the Argentine peso to one third o f i t s previous value and defaulted on 
i t s public debt. The ensuing c r i s i s in Argentina qu ick ly spilled over in to Uruguay w i t h 
Argentine nationals withdrawing their deposits f rom Uruguayan banks en masse. 

As already discussed in the sections above, the Bank chose structural adjustment 
lending as the p re fe r red vehicle for Bank support. Already, on August 8, 2002, p r io r to 
the j o i n t statement, the Board had approved a SAL in the amount o f US$151.5 m i l l i o n 
and a Special SAL in the amount o f US$101 m i l l ion . Those tw o loans were to be 
fo l lowed by a second SAL and a second Special SAL in the same amounts and approved 
in April 2003. 

In 

B o t h the SAL and the Special SAL o f 2002 were fully disbursed in two tranches 
upon the satisfactory completion o f the agreed action programs. The SAL supported 
macroeconomic and f i s c a l actions centered on restraining pub l ic sector wages. 
addition, the system of social protection was to be strengthened and protected along the 
l i n e s already discussed above in the section on P i l la r 1. The Spec ia l SAL focused more 
spec i f ica l ly on support fo r restructuring the Na t iona l Mortgage Bank (BHU) as part o f a 
broader banking system re fo rm that was also receiving support f r om the IMF. 
Compliance with the conditions o f the Special SAL was satisfactory overall.12 
Legislation was successfully enacted t o restructure the BHU and the BHU adopted and 
implemented a restructuring plan. Changes were made in the powers o f the Central Bank 
to remove the special privileges o f the BHU with respect to prudential regulation. 
Deposits f r om the general pub l ic unrelated to the housing programs o f the BHU were 
phased out o n schedule. A due diligence valuation and appraisal o f BNH po r t fo l io assets 
was carried out. A plan fo r divesting BNH o f i t s non-performing po r t fo l io was prepared 
and approved by the Boa rd o f Directors. The Boa rd o f Directors l ikew ise approved a 
new credit manual fo r BHN. 

A second SAL, approved in 2003, was entitled a “Public Se rv ices and Social 
Sectors SAL” t o re f lec t i t s content. The overall objective o f the loan was to boost 
competitiveness and economic g row th through the better p rov is ion o f pub l ic and social 
se rv ices and infrastructure. To that end, a broad range o f structural and po l icy reforms 
were identified with respec t t o infrastructure and pub l ic services. 
national elections in 2004 the ma in focus o f attention was in the po l i t ica l arena and the 
incentive to p ress ahead with structural reforms was diminished. 

In the run-up to 

The second SAL has been much slower t o move forward. Tw o incidents, in 
particular, caused the government t o hesitate. The f i r s t related t o OSE, the state-owned

management. In t e rm s o f the longer-term development effort, the 2002 crisis caused 
interruptions and delays in the progress o f Bank supported investment operations but i t 
did no t de-rail the program. Project implementation and analytic wo rk continued to move 
forward as indicated in the preceding sections on each o f t h e th ree pillars. In addition, the 
conditionality attached t o quick disbursing adjustment lending at the time o f the c r i s i s 
was designed to be supportive o f longer term-development goals, particularly in the areas 
o f social protection, pub l ic en te rp r ise re fo rm and governance. Hence, as a resu l t o f the 
Bank presence, the government did not lose sight o f the longer-term perspective, 
notwithstanding i t s preoccupation with c r i s i s management. 

Adjustment lending provided much-needed additional financial support and, at the 
same time, helped the government to address newly-exposed structural weaknesses that 
had not received full recognition p r io r to the crisis i t s e l f . In particular, a cu r rency 
mismatch between the assets and liabilities o f the banking system was shown to be an 
important source o f vulnerability. In that context, Bank-support re fo rm o f the National 
Mortgage Bank (BNH) furnished b y structural adjustment lending w i l l both improve 
financial sector efficiency and provide a much more secure foundation for housing 
policies, inc lud ing the p rov is ion o f low-cost housing fo r the poor. 

The Bank was very active w i t h analytic and advisory wo rk throughout the 2000 
CAS period. A ma jo r study entitled “Maintaining Social Equity in a Changing Economy” 
provided an important analytic anchor wh ich enabled the government to deal more 
effectively with issues o f poverty that were provoked by the economic crisis. Once the 
crisis struck, analytic and advisory wo rk was merged with operational wo rk in the 
preparation o f tw o SALs and two Special SALs. Free-standing studies o f the financial 
sector, 
trade and competitiveness were postponed because the macroeconomic 
environment was in a state o f flux but they were later incorporated in to a major study o f 
“Sources o f Growth” (FY05) wh ich provides a comprehensive analytic framework fo r 
dialogue with the incom ing ‘ R e n t e Amplio ” administration. A poverty update (FY04) 
also provides an important po in t of departure fo r further dialogue. 

Part C - Overall Bank Performance and Lessons Learned 

W h e n the 2000 CAS was drafted, the Bank had good reason t o be satisfied w i t h 
the development progress of Uruguay. In i t s implementation rev iew o f the previous 1997 
CAS, the OED had rated the overall outcome as h igh ly satisfactory. Structural reforms in 
the financial and pub l ic sectors were judged to be satisfactory and institutional 
development was rated as substantial. F rom that perspective the 1999 recession appeared 
to be a temporary setback that did not, in i tse l f , warrant serious concern. Longer-term 
considerations appeared t o suggest that Uruguay was firmly o n the path towards 
graduation from Bank lending. 

That i s no t to say that the Bank was unmindful o f possible sources o f 
vulnerability. 
I t i s noteworthy that, in a section o f the 2000 CAS en t i t led “Downside 
R isks ” , the two most important r i s k s we re stated as follows: 

Annex 1 
Page 18 o f 27 

“The most obvious external downside r isk wou ld be a recession (or even more 
severe economic crisis) in either Argentina or B raz i l ”. (para. 7 0 ) 

And then: 

“Another potential threat is a change in Argentina that encourages Argentine 
residents t o withdraw their deposits in Uruguayan Banks”. (para. 71) 

B o t h o f those r i s k s materialized to the great detriment o f Uruguay. Clearly, the 
Bank understood the likely serious consequences o f an economic crisis in Argentina and 
the equally serious consequences o f a run on Uruguayan Bank deposits. Yet, 
nonetheless, the executive summary o f the 2000 CAS re fe r red to “U ruguay ’s relatively 
modest vu lne rab i l i ty to external shocks” as jus t i f ica t ion for a lowe r program o f Bank 
lending and the concluding paragraph o f the 2000 CAS opened with the comforting 
assurance that: 

“ I n relative terms, there are few risks associated w i t h the Bank’s operations in 
Uruguay ’’. (para. 123) 

The Bank was no t alone in underestimating the likely prospect o f an impending 
crisis. In Ma rch 2001, an IMF review o f recent economic developments in Uruguay 
began by asserting that “The Uruguayan economy is gradually eme rg ing f rom the 1999- 
2000 recession”. As late as October 2001, in a second rev iew o f a Stand-By arrangement, 
the IMF was s t i l l o f the op in ion that “the economy is adjusting but output is not expected 
to p ick up un t i l 2002 ” (page 3 o f the executive summary). 

The experience o f t h e 2000 Uruguay CAS contains, therefore, some important 
lessons fo r country risk assessment, I t i s one th ing to simply acknowledge the presence 
o f r i s k s . I t i s quite another th ing to assess the p robab i l i ty attached to those r i s k s . There 
a re many possible reasons why the CAS failed to acknowledge h o w close Uruguay was 
t o the brink. I t may be that, in 2000, the Bank regarded t h e l ike l ihood o f an economic 
crisis in Argentina to be remote. There may have been a reluctance to step out o f l i n e 
with the op in ion o f other international financial institutions such as the IMF. Or, the 
Bank may have been reluctant to f lag the prospect o f an impending economic c r is is in 
Argentina fo r fear o f invok ing a se l f - fu l f i l l ing prophesy and/or incu r r ing the displeasure 
o f the government. Clearly, in such situations, the Bank has to we igh i t s response, taking 
in to account many different factors. A lesson to be learned from the experience o f the 
2000 Uruguay CAS i s that the Bank, in addition to identifying possible sources o f 
risk, needs to assess the probability that the risk w i l l materialize. 

Consistent with no rma l Bank practice, the 2000 CAS made re ferences t o a h i g h 
case and a l o w case program o f Bank operations depending upon country performance. I t 
i s noteworthy, however, that, although the 2000 CAS acknowledged the catastrophic risk 
of a possible economic c r i s i s in Argentina, i t made no proposal as to h o w t h e Bank m igh t 
respond to such a dire eventuality. In the absence o f a pre-considered country-specific

Public Debt Sustainability 

Under the base case macroeconomic scenario, the debt o f the pub l ic sector o f 
Uruguay as a share o f GDP i s projected to decline gradually over time. This outcome 
hinges o n a number o f assumptions, inc lud ing sustained good f isca l performance and 
implementation o f structural reforms to underpin fiscal performance and foster economic 
growth-as well as the absence o f new large external shocks. Unde r the base case 
assumptions, the pub l ic debt i s projected to f a l l f r om 92 percent o f GDP in 2004 to 60 
percent o f GDP by 2010 (Table 2). 

Three key factors underpinning debt sustainability are economic growth, fiscal 
policy, and the real exchange rate. G row th improves debt sustainability b y increasing 
resources available to finance the pub l ic debt. Fiscal policy, in particular a significant 
primary surp lus , contributes directly t o debt sustainability by reducing the Government’s 
bo r row ing requirement. Ach iev ing the p r ima ry s u r p l u s target w i l l hinge o n structural 
reforms in tax, pensions, health, and state modernization, as well as in infrastructure and 
pub l ic services to support private sector participation-thereby 
pub l ic investment budget. Debt sustainability in Uruguay i s sensitive to the path o f the 
real exchange rate given the large share o f pub l ic debt denominated in fo re ign currency. 
As demonstrated by the crisis, a sharp drop in the value o f the peso can dramatically 
increase the domestic currency value o f Uruguay’s external debt. Under the base case, 
the peso i s projected to appreciate moderately in l i n e with sustained economic recovery. 
However, this w i l l depend n o t on ly o n credible macroeconomic po l ic ies but also o n 
structural reforms to imp rove the investment climate, thereby attracting capital in f lows . 
Finally, debt sustainability also hinges o n continued support f r om the international 
financial institutions and access t o financial markets at interest rates commensurate with 
economic g row th proposals. 

reduc ing pressure on the 

Fiscal discipline i s a ma jo r p i l l a r required fo r debt sustainability. In the base case 
i t i s assumed that the p r ima ry s u r p l u s remains in the range o f the 3.8 percent o f GDP 
l e v e l attained in 2004. The Government program includes measures t o imp rove revenues, 
in particular the increase o f the VAT base, reduction o f the rate o f evasion in social 
security contributions, and the inc lus ion o f a new personal income tax and e l im ina t ion o f 
some distortionary taxes . In addition, the new Government has expressed i t s commitment 
to keeping expenditures under control. The fiscal projections under base case 
assumptions assume a modest recovery in wages and pensions f r om very l o w l e v e l s after 
the 2002 crisis, fo l lowed by stabilization as a share o f GDP. F ina l ly , the base scenario 
includes an increase in cap i ta l expenditures, also recovering f r om very l o w leve ls (Table 
1). Overall, medium t e r m p r ima ry expenditure i s projected to rema in well be low peak 
leve ls o f 200 1-02 under the assumption that the Government implements significant 
reforms to imp rove con ta in expenditure growth. Under the base case scenario, fiscal 
reforms o n bo th the revenue and expenditure side a l l ow fo r increases in expenditures as a 
percent o f GDP in pa ra l le l with the economic recovery, while ma in ta in ing the p r ima ry 

su rp lus in t h e target range. Were the revenue increases to generate a lowe r y ie ld than 
projected under the base case, then expenditures wou ld need to be tightened in order to 

ma in ta in the primary su rp lus .

A fou r th pillar i s sustained Government access t o financial markets at in te res t 
rates commensurate with economic g row th prospects. This i s a very important 
assumption, as i t i s possible that even i f the Government continues with prudent fiscal 
and monetary policies and commits to structural reforms, exogenous developments in 
international f inanc ia l markets may disrupt access to financing. In the base scenario, i t i s 
assumed that international spreads fo r U ruguay rema in at 400 basis points (the leve l o f 
M a r c h 2005). This assumption i s based o n the combination o f the f o l l ow i n g two factors: 
(a) projected increases in international in te res t rates ( f rom 2 percent in 2004 gradually 
increasing to reach 4.5 percent in 2008), a factor that w o u l d tend to increase the spread; 
and (b) the anticipated improvement in creditworthiness o f Uruguay in the base case, a 
factor that w o u l d tend t o reduce spreads. Therefore, the assumption o f a 400 basis points 
spread through the projected pe r iod im p l i c i t l y assumes that the tw o factors offset each 
other. 

In the base scenario, gross financing needs (interest plus amortization payments) 
in 2005 are estimated at US$2.1 b i l l ion . Amo r t iza t ion payments due are U S $ l . l b i l l ion , 
o f wh ich the most important are US$0.5 b i l l i o n to the IMF, US$0.2 b i l l i o n in bonds, 
US$0.2 b i l l i o n to IDB and US$O.l b i l l i o n to the W o r l d Bank (Table 2). Peaks in 
financing needs occur in 2006 (US$ 2.6 b i l l ion ) and 2007 (US$2.3 b i l l ion ) , largely 
related t o repayments to the IMF, and also t o a peak in bonds repayments in 2006. In the 

Annex 2 
Page 5 o f 10 

base scenario, consistency o f the financing projection requ i res that t h e Government issues 
bonds fo r about U S 0 . 5 b i l l i o n per year on average through 2005-10. This requirement 
resu l ts f r om the fo l low ing financing assumptions: (i) the IMF gradually reduces i t s 
exposure in Uruguay under a new program, (ii) the Wo r ld Bank lending strategy evolves 
according to the base case lending program envisaged in the CAS, and (iii) the IADB 
maintains i t s exposure broadly constant. In addition, i t i s assumed that the Government 
recovers assets f rom the Stability Fund fo r a total o f US$400 m i l l i o n du r ing 2005-7. This 
fund was created to support the financial sector during the banking crisis o f 2002.

Sensitivity Analysis 

The public debt path projected in the base scenario i s sens i t ive to the primary 
surplus, growth, and real exchange rate assumptions. Table 3 shows t h e effect o f 
deviations in the core macroeconomic assumptions on debt sustainability indicators. 
Changes in assumptions are taken one at a time, and a l l other assumptions remain as in 
the base case. 

The top section o f Table 3 shows the debt sustainability indicators under the base 
scenario assumptions, and presents a summary o f the core assumptions d r iv ing the resu l t . 
The second section shows sensitivity to deviations in the primary su rp lus target. For 
example, i f the p r ima ry surplus were reduced to 3 percent o f GDP starting in 2005, the 
public debt t o GDP ratio wou ld s t i l l decline but at a slower rate than under the base case, 
reaching about 67 percent by 2010, that is, 7 percentage points more than under base case 
assumptions. 

Increasing g row th rates by one percentage po in t starting in 2006 resu l ts in a 
dec l ine in the debt ratio t o 56 percent b y 2010. An equivalent one percentage point 
reduction in the g row th rate resu l ts in a debt ratio o f 64 percent in 2010. This resu l t i s 
important because i t highlights that Uruguay’s public sector debt wou ld l i k e l y remain on 
a declining pa th even with a slowdown in growth performance, p rov ided f isca l discipline 
i s maintained and the g row th slowdown i s limited. 

The base case resu l ts are quite sens i t ive to changes in the projected real exchange 
rate path. I f the rea l exchange rate were to converge to more appreciated levels observed 
during the 1990s, then the debt ratio wou ld dec l ine to a projected 51 percent b y 2010. 
This improvement i s explained not on ly by the fact that 90 percent o f debt i s 
denominated in foreign currency, but also because the projected primary su rp luses as 
measured in dollars are much larger, reducing the need to i s s u e debt fo r financing 
purposes. O n the other hand, i f the real exchange rate were to remain at the levels o f end 
2004, then the debt to GDP ra t io wou ld decline much more s low ly than under the base 
case, reaching a projected leve l of 72 percent by 2010. The 2004 rea l exchange rate i s 
h igh ly depreciated by historical standards and there are grounds to expect economic 
recovery to be accompanied by moderate real exchange rate appreciation as under the 
base case. 

Sovereign spread i s no t a factor to wh ich the base scenario resu l ts are h igh ly 
sensitive. This i s because the in te res t spread on ly affects new debt issues . Therefore, i t 
takes several years before a g iven change in spreads fu l ly translates in a change in the 
average in te res t rate o n pub l ic debt. An increase in sovereign spreads t o 600 basis points 
(200 basis points higher than the base case) wou ld r e s u l t in a projected debt to GDP ratio 
in 2010 less than one percentage po in t higher than the base case. O n the other hand, a 
spread o f 200 basis points r e s u l t s in a projected debt t o GDP ratio marginally be low 60 
percent in 2010, almost the same as in the base case. This l o w spread cou ld be possible 
in a scenario in wh ich sustained fiscal discipline enables Uruguay t o regain i t s investment 
grade status.

H i g h and Low Case Scenarios 

This section presen ts debt sustainability prospects resulting f r om combining the 
above deviations f r om the base case in an economically consistent direction (Figure 3). 
The h i g h case scenario combines the assumptions o f higher g row th rate, converging to 4 
percent o f GDP, primary s u r p l u s remaining at the base case leve l , a rea l exchange rate 
converging t o more appreciated levels, and sovereign spreads at 200 basis points. The 
resu l ts are presented in the top panel o f Table 4. In the h i g h scenario, the projected debt 
to GDP ra t io wou ld decline to 48 percen t in 2010, and a l l debt sustainability indicators 
wou ld show significant improvements.

In a l o w scenario, the projected pub l ic debt w o u l d rema in in the range o f 84 
percent by 20 10. This scenario combines the assumptions o f GDP g row th rate converging 
to 2 percent, the real exchange rate remaining at the l e v e l o f 2004, p r ima ry s u r p l u s at 3 
percent o f GDP and sovereign spreads at 600 basis points. This scenario h igh l igh ts the 
vulnerabilities o f pub l ic sector f inances o f Uruguay. F o r example, i f the primary su rp lus 
were to f a l l to 2 percent o f GDP, with a l l other assumptions as in the l o w scenario, 
projected pub l ic debt as a share o f GDP wou ld start t o increase in 2008, reaching about

c l ima te (P i l l a r 2), and modern ize the State to suppor t t h e p r i v a t e sector a n d innova t ion (P i l la r 3). In 
general, bene f i ts f r om po l ic ies based on p i l la rs 1, 2 and 3 are expected t o ma ter ia l ize in the short, medium 
and l o n g t e rm , respectively, but there are exceptions t o this generalized timeframe. F o r example, 
macroeconomic and f inanc ia l s tab i l i ty i s an essential requirement f o r a l l t im e periods. M ic roeconom ic 
po l ic ies a imed a t im p r o v i n g the investment c l ima te are re levan t even in the shor t te rm . Innova t ion policies, 
w h i c h by the ir ins t i tu t iona l na ture requ ire a l o n g implementation, are a p r i o r i t y f o r the short term. 

The f i r s t p i l l a r involves policies t o underpin f isca l and f i n a n c i a l s tab i l i ty , the e f f i c i e n t 
opera t ion o f fac to r ma rke ts (cap i ta l and labor), and the s treng then ing o f social pro tec t ion . Such 
po l ic ies can help consolidate econom ic recovery and alleviate the social s i tua t ion o f vulnerable groups by 
mak ing use o f idle capac i ty and rea l loca t ing factors o f p roduc t ion towards m o r e p roduc t ive companies and 
sectors, Improved allocative eficiency of existing factors ofproduction is expected to be the main driver o j 
productivity and growth over the short term. 

The second p i l l a r encompasses policies and re fo rms a imed t o establish an inves tmen t c l ima te 
favorable t o the accumu la t ion o f phys ica l and human capital; this inc ludes t r a d e a n d in teg ra t ion

The accumulation of physical and human capital combined w i th technical and allocative eficiency gains

URUGUAY 
CLIENT SURVEY 

Methodoloev 

T o better understand the development challenges and opportunities in U ruguay , the B a n k 
comm iss ioned a comprehensive c l ien t survey o f i t s p r im a r y in te r locu to rs and other 
stakeholders f r o m across U ruguayan society. 
In add i t ion t o generating interesting 
i n f o rm a t i o n o n h o w respondents v iewed the ove ra l l s i tua t ion in U r u g u a y and the 
coun t ry ’s p lace in the in te rna t iona l commun i ty , the survey p rov ides impo r tan t data o n 
h o w the Bank’s mos t impo r tan t partners perceive i t s role, relevance and effectiveness. 
The ob jec t ive has been t o use these data-and 
the perspective-provided by the survey t o 
help the Bank im p r o v e the support i t p rov ides t o U ruguay . 

The Survey was conducted in June and Ju ly 2004. A to ta l o f 256 po ten t ia l respondents 
were asked t o answer a set o f some 25 questions. O f this, 205, o r 80 percent, agreed t o 
complete the survey and subm i t the i r responses by m a i l . Participants we re d r aw n f r o m 
the va r ious leve ls o f government, members o f Parliament, agencies im p l em e n t i n g Bank 
projects, partner b i la te ra l and mu l t i la te ra l agencies, the p r iva te sector and c i v i l society, 
med ia and academia. T h e m a j o r i t y o f respondents, equa l ing some 25 percent o f the total, 
were f r o m the p r iva te sector, f o l l ow e d by academics and then by representatives f r o m 
federal, reg iona l and l o c a l government. As i s t y p i c a l f o r such surveys, there was 
s ign i f ican t va r ia t ion with respect t o the respondents’ know ledge o f the Bank ’s operations. 
Some h a d l i t t l e o r n o d i rec t invo lvemen t with the Bank, w h i l e m o r e than h a l f ind ica ted 
that they have been i n v o l v e d with o r a close observer o f W o r l d B a n k ac t iv i t ies f o r mo re 
than three years. 

Kev Findings 

The f o l l o w i n g i s a synopsis and seeks t o p r o v i d e an ove rv iew o f the m a i n findings o f 
wha t i s a comprehensive and de ta i led questionnaire. The f i r s t pa r t o f the survey was 
dedicated t o establishing a general sense o f h o w the respondents v i ew e d the ove ra l l 
cond i t ion o f U ruguay . M o r e than 60 percent o f respondents answered tha t the coun t ry 
was “heading in the right direction,” with s o l i d ma jo r i t ies b e l i e v i n g g o o d progress was 
be ing made in ensu r ing b road access t o educa t ion and sustaining the econom ic recovery. 
Less favorable progress was seen in the areas o f hea l th and ove ra l l p u b l i c service de l ive ry 
t o the poo r . Nevertheless, a s t rong m a j o r i t y o f respondents we re a t least “op t im is t ic ” 
about Uruguay’s future. These findings are interesting, as they re f lec t the m o o d o f at 
least part o f the electorate three mon ths be fo re a close e lec t ion tha t resu l ted in a change 
o f Government. 

Respondents across the B o a r d be l ieve tha t U ruguay shou ld m a i n t a i n i t s active 
pa r t ic ipa t ion in the in te rna t iona l f inanc ia l commun i ty . Some 97 percent ind ica ted that 
the coun t ry shou ld rece ive “at the least the same as o r m o r e assistance f r o m external 
sources” t o address k e y challenges-with m o r e t h a n 50 percent i n d i c a t i n g tha t mo re was 
needed, O n wha t tha t support shou ld be focused, nea r ly h a l f ind ica ted tha t reduc ing

pove r ty (26%) and generating employment (21%) were the mos t c r i t i c a l challenges 
fac ing U ruguay . 
Im p r o v i n g the business climate, strengthening the economy and 
im p r o v i n g gove rnmen t effectiveness fo l lowed . These f i v e areas together accounted f o r 
nea r ly 90 pe rcen t o f the “most impo r tan t ” responses. 

The World Bank 

Regarding the W o r l d Bank , 71 percent o f respondents ind ica ted tha t the Bank should be 
“more i n v o l v e d in U ruguay ’s development strategies.” An add i t iona l 28 percent said the 
current l e v e l was appropriate; leav ing o n l y 1 percent o f a l l respondents saying the Bank 
shou ld be less i n v o l v e d in U ruguay . In terms o f where the Bank c o u l d make the greatest 
con t r ibu t ion , the strongest responses centered o n suppo r t ing econom ic g r ow t h and 
pove r ty reduction, with some interesting differences among stakeholders groups. 
Respondents f r o m the p r iva te sector, f o r example, ra ted h e l p i n g t o create emp loymen t 
oppo r tun i t ies f o r the p o o r as the mos t impo r tan t area f o r Bank invo lvemen t , w h i l e c i v i l 
society o rgan iza t ions be l ieved the Bank’s focus shou ld b e o n strengthening the f inanc ia l 
system. F o r the i r part, gove rnmen t o f f ic ia ls f r o m b o t h the cen t ra l and reg iona l l e v e l 
i d e n t i f i e d the Bank’s r o l e in im p r o v i n g the e f f ic iency o f the p u b l i c sector as paramount. 
These are no tab le findings and suggest the soph is t ica t ion o f the va r ious stakeholder 
groups in U ruguay . 

There were o the r in te res t ing findings about where respondents saw the Bank’s greatest 
value-added. N e a r l y 60 percent o f respondents though t inves tmen t l e n d i n g t o finance 
development p ro jec ts was the Bank ’s mos t e f fec t ive means o f support, w h i l e j u s t under a 
quarter though t p r o v i d i n g l e n d i n g t o p romo te p o l i c y r e f o r m was m o s t impo r tan t . T h i s 
corresponded f a i r l y c lose ly with a separate ques t ion o n the greatest challenges f o r the 
Bank, with some 3 3 percent o f respondents finding tha t the Bank ’s development p o l i c y 
lending shou ld better re f lec t the p o l i t i c a l rea l i t ies o f the country, and another 24 percent 
fee l ing tha t the Bank shou ld b e mo re open t o alternative p o l i c y options. At the s am e 
time, o n a personal level, the B a n k has c lea r ly established g o o d re la t ions with Uruguay, 
with a l l respondents i n d i c a t i n g tha t the B a n k treats c l ien ts and stakeholders with respect, 
and that s ta f f are s t ra igh t fo rwa rd and accessible. 

F r o m the Bank’s perspective, the ove rwhe lm ing preference o f respondents f o r ma in ta ined 
and stepped up support and cooperation i s we lcome news. T h e challenge ahead, 
according t o the survey, w i l l b e t o do a better j o b ensuring greater effectiveness in those 
interventions pe rce ived as m o s t impo r tan t . A s i t stands, the su rvey shows that there i s a 
po ten t ia l ly t r o u b l i n g mismatch, with the Bank seen as m o r e e f fec t ive in areas considered 
important, but o f r e l a t i v e l y less u rgency (infrastructure, governance), than in those areas 
mo re d i rec t ly re la ted t o p o v e r t y reduc t ion and social protection, whe re the Bank’s 
invo lvemen t i s considered by the m a j o r i t y o f respondents t o b e absolutely c r i t ica l . 
Perhaps this finding shou ld n o t b e su rp r is ing g i v e n the c om p l e x i t y o f pove r ty reduc t ion 
in n o rm a l times, l e t alone w h e n the impac t o f severe c r is is i s s t i l l ev iden t and far- 
reaching. Nevertheless, i t p rov ides a valuable gu ide f o r the Bank as i t seeks t o m o v e 
fo rwa rd in t rans fo rm ing i t s suppo r t f r o m c r is is response t o l o n g t e rm development.

Overall, the Bank i s perceived t o be re la t ive ly e f fec t ive j though mo re needs t o be done. 
I t i s im p o r t a n t t o no te that the ove ra l l ra t ing obscures impo r tan t differences among the 
respondent groups. Perhaps mos t notable, there i s a s t rong co r re la t ion between a 
respondent’s f am i l i a r i t y with the Bank and h o w s/he ra ted i t s ove ra l l effectiveness. F o r 
example, ra t ings were s ign i f ican t ly h ighe r than the average among respondents f r o m 
agencies that imp lemen t Bank supported projects. Conversely, respondents with the 
lowes t l e v e l o f f am i l i a r i t y with the Ban l - f rom 
c i v i l society organizations, academics, 
and the p r iva te sector-gave 
the 
lowes t ratings 
f o r effectiveness. W h i l e th is 
demonstrates the con t inued need f o r the B a n k t o im p r o v e the effectiveness o f a l l o f i t s 
interventions, i t also suggests the need f o r stepped-up outreach to, and commun ica t ion 
with, a b roade r spectrum o f U ruguayan society. Th is pa r t icu la r ly appears t o be the case 
with the p r iva te sector, w h i c h made up a quarter o f a l l respondents, was near the b o t t om 
o f the scale in i t s f am i l i a r i t y with the B a n k and gave ove ra l l med ioc re ra t ings in terms o f 
effectiveness. 

The c l ien t su rvey has p r o v e d t o be a h e l p f u l t o o l in i d e n t i f y i n g where the Bank can be 
mos t e f fec t ive in i t s support t o the U ruguayan authorities, and has comp lemen ted the 
p roduc t ive mee t ings Bank s ta f f and senior management held with the i n c om i n g 
adm in is t ra t ion during the t rans i t ion period. Indeed, i t m a y p r o v e use fu l at some p o i n t in 
the fu tu re t o conduc t a f o l l ow - u p survey with the same stakeholders in U ruguay t o assess 
progress in the key areas i d e n t i f i e d above.

Montevideo, M a y 4,2005 

Mr. James D. Wolfensohn 
President 
The W o r l d Bank G roup 
Washington D .C . 

Dear Mr. Wo l fensohn : 

I am pleased to address y o u on beha l f o f the new Government that took o f f ice in the Or ien ta l 
Repub l ic o f U ruguay last M a r c h lst., 
after hav ing obtained the absolute ma jo r i ty o f votes in the f i r s t round 
o f the general elections held in October 2004. The new Government, l e d by our President, Dr. Tabard 
Vbzquez, represents an impor tan t democratic trans i t ion and i s the result o f a deep desire o f change that 
the Uruguayan people was c rav ing for. The changes we are under tak ing in a par t ic ipa tory way have the 
consensus o f ou r society, as we l l as the diligent and enthusiastic support o f a l l the friends o f the country, 
inc lud ing the in terna t iona l f inanc ia l institutions. 

At present we are deve lop ing mu l t i-annua l cooperation programs with the W o r l d Bank, the Inter- 
Amer ican Deve lopmen t Bank and the In terna t iona l Mone tary Fund. In particular, we are f ina l iz ing with 
the W o r l d Bank the new Coun t ry Assistance Strategy (CAS) fo r the upcom ing f i v e years, under wh ich we 
expect to define together a new assistance program fo r U ruguay with the ins t i tu t ion that y o u represent. In 
this context, we have already iden t i f ied the development programs and projects with highest pr ior i ty , as 
well as the ongo ing projects w h i c h were in i t ia ted by the fo rme r adm in is tra t ion and that we are in teres ted 
in comp le t ing successfully. 

W i t h i n this con tex t -and as y o u know - on April 8*,, 2003, the W o r l d Bank Boa rd o f D irec tors 
approved a Structural Ad jus tmen t L o a n (UR-71640) - SAL I1 and a Special S truc tura l Ad jus tmen t Loan 
(UR-7 1650) - SSAL 11. These programs contain general objectives o f econom ic g row th reactivation, 
improvement o f Uruguay's economy competitiveness and improvemen t o f the population's general 
welfare. The loans, negotiated and approved as part o f the assistance package mob i l ized by the 
international ins t i tu t ions fo r ou r coun try in response to the serious f inanc ia l cr is is we faced o n 2002, were 
signed j o i n t l y and made e f fec t ive by the par t ies o n April 22"d, o f the same year. SAL I1 focuses on 
increasing e f f ic iency in the pub l ic and infrastructure services, while SSAL I1 aims t o imp rove the impac t 
o f pub l ic expenditures o n the education and hea l th sectors. 

Currently, SSAL I1 (Soc ia l Sectors) i s well-advanced, the f inanc ia l and economic conditions in 
our country have imp roved remarkab ly and U ruguay n o longe r E e d s t h e excep t iona l f inanc ing that was 
granted at that time through special loans. Therefore, hav ing evaluated in the light o f the present situation 
the d i f feren t options t o complete bo th programs, we have decided t o request the cancellation o f the to ta l 
amount o f the S S A L I1 loan funds tha t rema in undisbursed as o f the present date. Given that the country 
has achieved even more amb i t ious goals that those agreed in the S S A L 11, we are making this request with 

Annex 6 

Page 6 o f 7 

the conv ic t ion tha t we w i l l soon f ina l ize successfully the current negotiations in the context o f the new 
CAS, w h i c h w e trust w i l l be conducive t o the implementation o f a new operation in support o f our social 
programs. 

Rega rd ing SAL 11 (Pub l ic Services and Infrastructure) implementation, we w o u l d l i k e to reiterate 
the comm i tmen t o f the Or ien ta l Repub l ic of Uruguay bo th to the general and specific objectives o f this 
operation. T h e s e goals were shared by our Adm in is tra t ion ever since the po l i t ica l campaign wh ich 
even tua l ly led u s to the Presidency, g iven the p r io r i ty we accord t o re forms a imed at reduc ing prices, 
imp rov ing qua l i ty and coverage and increasing e f f ic iency o f investment, produc t ion and d is tr ibu t ion o f 
pub l ic and infrastructure services. 

S t ra tegy 

The strategy this Government has adopted to achieve the general and specific objectives o f SAL 
I1 includes the imp lemen ta t ion o f re forms directed to: f i r s t , fos ter ing compe t i t ion in the markets; 
strengthening and conso l ida t ing regu la tory entities, and lega l and regu la tory frameworks fo r the pub l ic 
sectors and infrastructure services; strengthening the entities responsible f o r defining po l ic ies and 
p lann ing the development o f each sector, and c la r i fy ing the difference between the responsibilities o f 
these ins t i tu t ions and those charged with regu la tory functions. 

Second, t o imp rove t h e e f f ic iency o f pub l ic expenditures by means o f a better corporate 
governance, mo re transparency in pub l ic operators’ administration, be t ter de f in i t ion o f obligations and 
responsibilities, and a reduc t ion o f tax distortions. 

Third, t o modernize pub l ic operators by strengthening and op t im iz ing their investment, operation 
and maintenance programs. 

And, fourth, to rev iew t a r i f f structures and subsidy po l ic ies applicable t o pub l ic services in order 
to be t ter complement the Government’s social po l icy in bene f i t o f the low - income population. In 
particular, attempt t o make these consistent among sectors and to focus them o n favo r ing the poorest. 

Specific Ob jec t ives 

The m a i n objectives we are comm i t ted t o in each sub-sector are: 

Energy. The comm i tmen t of ach iev ing SAL I I ’ s specific objectives in the upcom ing n ine t o 
twe lve months i s par t o f our Governmen t strategy. In the energy sector, this strategy seeks t o define --in 
the context o f our na t iona l p o l i c y tha t we are de f in ing in a par t ic ipa tory and exp l ic i t way-- the 
strengthening, consolidation and imp lemen ta t ion o f the lega l and regu la tory frameworks o f the different 
energy sectors and the regu la tory entity, as w e l l as the ra t iona l iza t ion o f ta r i f fs and prices. 

As a r e s u l t of the referendum h e l d in December 2003, the re are some objectives that are more 
difficult to achieve, such as those tha t seek t o regulate impo r ta t ion and p roduc t ion o f pe tro leum products 
and to define ta r i f fs and access ru les to Mon tev ideo port, and t o the A N C A P infrastructure fac i l i t ies 
located there. Since in the referendum 62 percent o f the U ruguayan popu la t ion vo ted in favo r o f the 
annulment o f a l aw dated January 2002 tha t e l im ina ted ANCAP ’s monopo ly o f t h e impor t , expor t and 
refinement o f crude oil, and a l lowed the strategic association o f A N C A P with an in terna t iona l operator, 
our Government n ow faces the challenge o f advancing by means that a re compa t ib le with the popular 
w i l l . 

Annex 6 
Page 7 o f 7 

Potable water and sewerage. Ou r specific objectives in the potable water and sewerage sector 
are to define and imp lemen t a lega l and regulatory framework fo r the sector, as w e l l as t o strengthen, 
consolidate and imp lemen t the regu la tory e n t i t y in charge thereof. 

However, as in the case o f the energy sector, in October 2004 a second referendum --approved by 
two thirds o f the Uruguayan population-- amended the Cons t i tu t ion mak ing potable water and sewerage 
services the exc lus ive doma in o f the pub l ic sector. In fact, this second referendum forb ids no t on ly the 
par t ic ipa t ion o f the pr iva te sector through sales o f assets and concessions, but also the association o f 
pub l ic companies with p r iva te f i r m s t o prov ide these services. A lso in th is area -as in the ene rgy sector- 
t h e challenge i s t o be able to advance with measures compatible with the popu lar w i l l . 

Communications. In this case the specific objectives are the conso l ida t ion o f the lega l and 
regulatory framework of the telecommunications and postal services sectors, and strengthening market 
competition. We seek t o strengthen the capacity o f the competent regu la tory entity as we l l . 

Transport. F ina l ly , the specific objective in the transport sector i s t o consolidate the recent 
re forms and successful advances through the actions supported by SAL 11. 

We are op t im is t ic and conv inced that wo rk ing together with the Bank we w i l l be able to face the 
challenges invo lved in ach iev ing the objectives we have se t fo r ourselves, and to iden t i fy new goals and 
instruments that w i l l a l low us t o implement our strategy in the above men t ioned sectors. 

We are sure that o n l y by imp rov ing competition, regulation, corporate governance, social po l ic ies 
and e f f ic iency o f operators in the pub l ic and infrastructure services sectors w i l l it be possible to improve 
in a sustainable way the country’s competitiveness, and to guarantee i t s econom ic g row th and the welfare 
o f our population. 

Sincerely, 

Dan i lo As to r i 
Minister o f Economy and Finance

to consult with c i v i l society on the blueprint o f the Country Assistance 
Strategy f o r FY05-10 wh ich the Bank was in the process o f discussing w i t h 
the new administration; 
to obtain the views o f c i v i l society on the Bank’s con t r ibu t ion t o Uruguay’s

to e n l i s t the support o f c i v i l society in the implementation o f the Bank 
strategy, inc lud ing new ways to invo lve c i v i l society in the design and 
implementation o f Bank-funded projects. 

Consultation Process 

Location: The consultations we re organized by the Bank in partnership w i t h the 
Government o f Uruguay and the F o r o Consultivo Econdmico Social del MERCOSUR 
(FCES). H a l f day-long meetings were held in th ree locations: the capital c i ty o f 
Montevideo, Paysandu and Tacuaremb6. 

0 Montevideo, the nation’s capital, with about 1.3 million inhabitants accounts for 
more than one third o f the country’s population. I t i s the country’s political, 
economic and social center. 

0 Pavsandu, a town o f about 60,000 inhabitants in the wes te rn part o f the country, 
close to the Argentine border, was selected primarily because o f i t s h i g h

economic potential, the particularly severe impact o f the crisis o n the loca l 
economy, as well as the active role played loca l ly b y c i v i l society organizations. 
The area has suffered very h i g h l e v e l s o f emigration and i t i s struggling to attract 
investment back to the agricultural sector, once the mainstay o f the economy. 

0 Tacuaremb6, a ru ra l t ow n o f about 40,000 inhabitants in the northern part o f the 
country, was selected because i t i s one o f the country’s poorest areas. The loca l 
economy, primarily based o n agriculture, was severe ly impacted by the crisis. 

F o r o Consu lt ivo Economico-Social 
de l M E R C O S U R (FCES ) 

The consultations o n the Bank’s strategy were co-organized b y the F o r o Consultivo 

Economico-Social del MERCOSUR (FCES), Seccion Uruguaya. The FCES i s a 

permanent ins t i tu t iona l structure o f MERCOSUR and has p r ima r i ly a consulting role. I t 
s tar ted to operate at the regional l e v e l in 1995. FCES i s structured in to national chapters, 
each o f w h i c h has representation f r om different l e v e l s o f c i v i l society: the private sector, 
the unions and NGOs. The wide variety o f i t s constituencies helps the FCES ensure broad 
and active pa r t ic ipa t ion o f a l l sectors o f c i v i l society. 
I t provides an important 
ins t i tu t iona l setting for expressing concerns and fo r carrying out initiatives o f the various 
segments o f c i v i l society. 

Participants: The meetings attracted a h i g h number o f participants, more than 200 in 
total, with a pa r t icu la r ly strong attendance in the in te r io r o f the country. There was strong 
participation f r om the en t i re spectrum o f c i v i l society. The consultations no t on ly 
included specialized NGOs with expertise o n h o w the W o r l d Bank and other multilateral 
financial institutions work, but also representatives f r om unions, fa i th groups, academia, 
workers’ organizations, producers’ associations and t h e media. Government o f f ic ia ls at 
the national, departmental and loca l l e v e l (including the Mayo rs o f bo th Paysand6 and 
Tacuaremb6) also participated in the meetings, p rov id ing a c r i t ica l perspective o n 
important po l icy issues . 

Documentation: Documents and pamphlets especially prepared fo r the consultations 
include a p ro f i le o f a l l active projects and a summary o f the Po l icy Notes discussed with 
the Government elect in January. These we re distributed t o meeting participants to 
broaden pub l ic in fo rma t ion o n the Bank’s ro le and activities, and p o l i c y options 
discussed with the administration. 

Meeting Organization: A l l meetings were structured around a presentation explaining 
briefly the ro le o f the Bank in Uruguay in the recent past and i l lus t ra t ing the ma in 
objectives o f the proposed CAS o n the basis o f the preliminary agreements reached with 
the authorities. The presentation was, a l l in all, well received by participants and 
generated very constructive and l ive ly discussions, pa r t icu la r ly regarding the perceived 
role o f the Bank. F o l l ow i n g the presentation, participants split in to break-up wo rk ing 

groups and we re asked t o respond t o a number o f questions ou t l ined in a questionnaire. 
A t t e n t i o n was g i v e n t o ensure a b road representation o f c i v i l society organizations in

M a i n Themes: The meetings at a l l three loca t ions ind ica ted a s ign i f ican t support f o r the

challenges s ing led ou t by the break-up groups and those b e i n g i d e n t i f i e d in t h e CAS . The 
m a i n themes tha t emerged f r o m the discussion were a general app rec ia t ion o f the 
country’s f isca l constraints, and pa r t icu la r ly the need t o ensure a balance be tween the 
demands o f the educa t ion sector, w h i c h needs add i t iona l resources, and those o f the

the need t o strengthen the p u b l i c sector was emphasized in the course o f the discussions.

strong c l a i m f o r increased p u b l i c in fo rma t ion , a broader outreach strategy and enhanced 
c i v i l society pa r t ic ipa t ion in the fu tu re . T o this end, participants we lcomed the opening o f 
a W o r l d B a n k representative o f f i c e in Mon tev ideo w h i c h w i l l increase p u b l i c in fo rma t ion 
o n the Bank ’s p rog rams and w i l l enhance pa r t ic ipa t ion by c i v i l society in the design and 
imp lemen ta t ion o f Bank - funded projects. Government representatives also stressed the 
importance o f b e i n g transparent in the imp lemen ta t ion o f the coun t ry ’s fu tu re strategy, 
and ind ica ted the i r openness in th is regard. 

A numbe r o f perceptions about the Bank emerged f o r c e f u l l y th roughou t the consultations 
with c i v i l society representatives. Participants be l ieved tha t the econom ic g r ow t h o f the 
1990s was a r t i f ic ia l , and tha t i t comp rom ised many o f the t rad i t iona l values o f U ruguayan 
society, such as equ i ty and so l ida r i ty . Participants a t t r ibu ted part o f the respons ib i l i ty f o r 
such loss o f values t o the Bank, a l though Bank ’s invo lvemen t in U r u g u a y during the 
1990s was in fac t l im i t e d . There was also a concern with the im p a c t o f the Bank’s 
assistance, as many o f the areas in w h i c h the Bank has been invo lved , such as education, 
continue t o present a challenge. However, the pe rcep t ion o f the B a n k va r ied across the 
three locations. W h i l e in Paysandfi participants focused o n past experiences and wha t 
wen t wrong, the a t t i tude o f participants in Mon tev ideo and Tacuaremb6 was mo re 
fo rwa rd - look ing . 

Desp i te these d i f f i c u l t perceptions, there was a pos i t ive a t t i tude towa rds developing a 
constructive d ia logue with the Bank in the future, and a p o s i t i v e recep t ion by a l l groups 
in terms o f a future expans ion o f the Bank ’s p rog ram in the coun t ry . Participants 
we lcomed the idea o f the consultations and it was clear tha t there was a desire f r o m c i v i l 
society t o take a m o r e p ro -ac t ive r o l e in the imp lemen ta t ion o f the Bank ’s strategy in the 
fu tu re . 

Proposalsfor Engagement: A number o f areas o f fu tu re Bank i n v o l v em e n t w h i c h c a l l 
f o r close co l labo ra t ion with c i v i l society were iden t i f ied . As a ma t te r o f p r io r i ty , c i v i l 
society w o u l d we lcome the oppo r tun i ty f o r increased i n v o l v em e n t in recons t ruc t ing those 
values w h i c h are pe rce ived t o have been los t as a resu l t o f the crisis, and i t w o u l d be a 
key partner f o r the Gove rnmen t in this endeavor. 

With regard t o social inclusion, c i v i l society c o u l d p l a y a m a j o r r o l e in ensuring that the 
needs o f the m o s t vu lne rab le groups ( inc lud ing children, youth, the d isab led and women) 
are addressed. 

The need f o r b roade r r e f o rm s in the education sector was also iden t i f ied . In particular, 
participants stressed tha t there i s a need t o go beyond p u n c t u a l in te rven t ions and simple 
p i l o t projects, and t o e l i c i t the ac t ive invo lvemen t o f teachers in the des ign o f future

reforms. Further, there i s a need to link efforts aimed at imp rov ing education w i t h the 
demands a r is ing in the productive sector, particularly in the area o f professional training. 

With respect to the productive sector, in addition to policies aimed at increasing 
p roduc t iv i ty and creating an enabling environment for the private sector, participants f e l t 
that there i s ample scope fo r c i v i l society participation in the design and implementation 
of programs targeted at bolstering small and medium enterprises, micro-enterprises and 
cooperatives. 

Finally, in t h e area of state re fo rm , participants noted that c i v i l society cou ld play a key 
ro le in the mon i to r ing of resu l ts obtained by the public sector. 

Conclusion 

The CAS consultations were invaluable in t e rm s o f validating the strategy being 
d iscussed with the new administration and in bu i ld ing a stronger link be tween the Bank 
and c i v i l society groups across the country. There was overall a strong consensus o n the 
proposal fo r an expansion o f the Bank’s ro le in Uruguay in the com ing years and fo r 
strong Bank support to the Government’s agenda fo r accelerated g row th with equity. The 
consultations also responded to c i v i l society’s appetite fo r increased in fo rma t ion o n t h e 
Bank’s role and programs, and demands fo r greater openness o n the part o f Government 
concerning i t s development program. The consultations provided a renewed opportunity 
fo r a more sustained exchange o f in fo rma t ion and interaction with c i v i l society o n t h e 
Bank’s country assistance strategy, particularly in the design and implementation o f 
f u t u r e Bank projects.
