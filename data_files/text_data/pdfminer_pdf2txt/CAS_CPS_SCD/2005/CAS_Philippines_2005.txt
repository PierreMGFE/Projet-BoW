Country Context and Development Challenges 

i. 
The Philippines enjoys a tremendous range of assets to draw upon for its 
development. Government, business, and academia benefit from world-class talent and the 
high level of overseas employment reflect international demand for its labor force. It is 
considered one of the most biologically rich and diverse countries in the world, with 
substantial mineral, oil, gas, and geothermal potential. Being located in the dynamic East 
Asia region, the private sector is well-positioned to exploit trade opportunities. And, the 
country benefits from a very active civil society that can be an important agent for change. 

ii. 
Despite these endowments, however, overall development outcomes in the Philippines 
over the last decades have fallen short of potential. Per capita growth has lagged significantly 
behind other East Asian countries. Relatively low domestic and foreign investment flows 
reflect weaknesses in the investment climate. Firms consider macroeconomic instability, 
corruption, and poor infrastructure as significant constraints. Macroeconomic instability, in 
particular, is attributed to weak fiscal performance and a high level of public debt. Closely 
linked to these challenges is the lack of social inclusion. Income inequality remains high, 
excluding the poor from their share of the income benefits generated by growth. 

iii. 
The contrast between the country’s human and physical assets and its modest 
development outcomes is perplexing. Ultimately, this can be explained by the limited ability 
of public institutions to resist capture by special interests and to work effectively for the 
common good, a sign of a frail social contract between the government and its citizens. Put 
succinctly, this has created a vicious cycle of weak public services, lack of trust in the 
government, and an unwillingness to provide adequate resources to it. As a result, the 
Philippines has been unable to achieve its development potential. 

iv. 
There is widespread consensus concerning the basic institutional and political 
diagnosis of the development challenges. This creates the opportunity for change. If 
citizens begin to see that public institutions are improving their governance and delivery of 
services, they are more likely to vest authority and provide resources to the state. A 
stronger state will be able to increase social inclusion and cohesiveness. Increased 
revenues will improve fiscal balances, increase investor confidence, and thus spur a 
virtuous cycle of more effective public institutions, growth, and poverty reduction. 

v. 
The economic and social aspects of the reform agenda supported by this CAS are 
inseparable. The Philippines poverty reduction strategy, in fact, is integrally embodied in the 
development strategy of this CAS with its two objectives (economic growth and social 
inclusion) and two levers (fiscal stability and improved governance). Higher and sustained 
growth would need to be the major driver of poverty reduction through jobs and income 
creation (despite the lesser effect of growth on poverty reduction under high income 
inequality). With more social inclusion the poor would be empowered and enabled to 
participate in the opportunities afforded by economic growth, supported by public spending 
targeted to the poor as well as institutional reforms for market access and participation in 
decision processes. Fiscal reforms, in turn, are essential for growth, for the prevention of 
crises that inevitably would hurt the poor severely, and for building-up effective social 
spending that reaches the poor. Finally, governance improvements would focus on 
institutional changes that let the state deliver its core services to all citizens, especially the 
poor who are often excluded.

tool to monitor progress, evaluate impact, and adjust accordingly. In doing so, we will apply a 
key lesson: the need for the Bank Group to be realistic in what it can influence over the CAS 
period in a middle-income country in which Bank Group resources are comparatively small. 

Delivering the Bank Group Program 

ix. 
Our strategy seeks to provide the most value through the appropriate level and blend 
of lending, advice, and knowledge sharing. The Bank Group’s effectiveness will depend, to 
a large degree, on the extent of political appetite for reform and the pace of change. Thus, 
the CAS is designed to be opportunistic in responding to reform efforts. Under any 
scenario, the approach focuses on the medium-term institutional challenges and addresses 
the complexity of the country’s broader development challenges. 

x. 
The scale of IBRD commitments will be determined by progress on fiscal reforms, 
reflecting the overarching importance of fiscal adjustment in the short-term and the need to 
mitigate and manage risks. If the opportunity arises, the CAS can aggressively support 
urgent fiscal reforms. Assuming a scenario of modest fiscal reform, the Bank’s base case 
program would fall within a range of US$450-900 million of investment lending for the three- 
year CAS period. In a high case scenario, reflecting substantial and sustained fiscal 
reforms, the Bank would be prepared to provide total lending, including development policy 
lending (DPL), of up to US$1.8 billion over three years. Entry into the high case could occur 
once a track record of policies and associated outcomes have been established, with a 
reduction of the consolidated public sector deficit of 2 percent of GDP relative to 2004, 
compatible with a deficit reduction of 3 percent of GDP during the 2005-07 period. 
Substantial progress toward the high case would be considered in an enhanced base case, 
characterized by steady progress in strengthening public sector revenues and reducing the 
public sector deficit. IFC operations for the three-year period are anticipated to be about 
US$350 million. 

xi. 

In the Philippines there has been remarkable receptivity for the Bank Group’s 
analytical and advisory activities (AAA). Given the impact of such activities, AAA support 
will be essential irrespective of the size of the lending program. Trust funds will continue to 
play a critical role in supporting AAA. Knowledge sharing will also continue to be an integral 
business line of the Bank Group. We will leverage both our financial and non-lending 
support through deeper coordination with development partners. 

Suggested Topics for Board Discussion 

Board members may wish to discuss, among others, the following aspects of this

CAS:

The suitability of the core design elements of the CAS, intended to maximize the 
Bank Group’s impact. 
The adequacy of the proposed lending scenarios. 
The scope of collaboration between the Bank, IFC, and MIGA. 
The realism of the results framework for a middle-income borrower like the 
Philippines, where past development achievements have been limited and the Bank 
Group’s financial contribution is a modest one. 

1. Country Context and Development Challenges 

Country Endowments 

I. 
The Philippines has a tremendous range of assets to draw upon for its development. 
Perhaps the greatest asset of the Philippines is its people. Government, business, and 
academia benefit from world-class talent. While there are concerns about the quality of 
education and thus of the labor force going forward, the Philippines is still reaping the benefits 
from its past investments in education. The huge proportion of overseas workers (7.8 million in 
2003 or 25 percent of the active labor force) may reflect the lack of adequate employment 
opportunities at home, but it also represents the global demand for the skills, English 
proficiency, and adaptability of the Filipino work force. 

2. 
In terms of natural resources, the Philippines is considered to be one of the world’s most 
bio-diverse countries. Mineral resources cover about 30 percent of total land area. Oil, gas, 
and geothermal potential are substantial, as are the opportunities for expanding world-class 
tourism. And, the Philippines is located in the dynamic East Asia region, which has grown 
significantly faster than other regions and is now growing at its swiftest pace since before the 
1997 financial crisis. Economic growth in the region (excluding Japan) is expected to exceed 7 
percent in 2004. Intra-regional trade has expanded sharply, supported particularly by strong 
demand from China. The Philippines has benefited substantially from this growth. Between 
2001 and 2003, China’s imports from the Philippines grew by 224 percent, significantly 
outpacing other East Asian comparators and the regional average (81 percent), albeit from a 
low base. 
3. 
The Philippines economy has the basis for a vibrant private sector -- outward orientation 
with a strong export sector, liberal domestic and foreign investment regimes, and good 
entrepreneurial and managerial talents. And, the country is well-positioned in several dynamic 
sectors. In particular, electronics account for over 60 percent of total exports. As a location for 
offshore information technology (IT), the Philippines already compares relatively well in terms of 
financial competitiveness and human resource skills. Tourism is growing fast worldwide and the 
Philippines has the comparative advantage to tap this growing market. 

4. 
The country also benefits from a very active civil society. The level of public debate is 
high. The dense network of non-governmental, civic, and religious organizations, free mass 
media, and articulate urban class constitute a potential agent for change unlike any found in 
other East Asian societies. 

Development Outcomes and Challenges’ 

5. 
Despite the Philippines’ considerable resources and advantages, overall development 
outcomes over the last decades have fallen short of potential. Per capita growth has been 
much lower than in neighboring countries, and the reduction in poverty has been only modest. 
Because of weak fiscal performance and the accumulation of debt following the 1997 Asian 
financial crisis, the country has experienced substantial macroeconomic vulnerability. The 
contrast between the country’s human and physical assets and its modest development 

’ Detailed analysis of the country’s economic situation is presented in the Developmenf Policy Review, to be 
distributed to the Executive Directors of the World Bank in tandem with this CAS. For additional analysis 
covering a broad range of themes and sectors, see the Discussion Briefs prepared in 2004 by Bank staff to 
inform the policy dialogue among various levels and branches of government as well as other development 
partners (available through the website: www.worldbank.org.ph). 

2 

outcomes is perplexing. This CAS is built on the emerging consensus of many within the 
country that this conundrum is due to the inability of public institutions to resist capture by 
special interests and thus promote the common good. As the result of a weak state and its 
limited ability to provide public goods and services, the Philippines has been unable to achieve 
its development potential. 

6. 
Many scholars assess that relics of traditional governance structures, established during 
colonial rule, have endured in the form of informal networks of power outside of the state that 
remained influential, while the state itself remained fractured.* Parts of public governance have 
not kept pace with the modernization of other parts of society and the economy leading to a 
curious coexistence of modern institutions and a sophisticated economy with elements of a 
patronage-based political and public sector system. Within the country, there remains a 
common perception that elements of the state serve fragmented groups and narrow vested 
interests. 

7 . 
The weakness of many public institutions and their difficulties in working for the common 
good reflect a frail social contract between the state and its citizens. Because citizens perceive 
that they do not receive the services that they deserve, they are reluctant to vest authority in the 
government and provide it with sufficient resources. This leads to inadequate public sector 
finances that further hamper the government’s ability to effectively deliver services, particularly 
social services to the poor, like education and health. Because weak public finances reduce 
investor confidence, the economy is also deprived of much needed investments that are critical 
to growth. Together this creates a vicious cycle in which economic growth is less than its 
potential, thus impeding poverty reduction and social inclusion, in the context of weak public 
f i nances . 

8. 
Given broad agreement on the basic diagnosis and the direction of needed reform, the 
Philippines has the opportunity to turn the vicious into a virtuous cycle. Stronger growth since 
2001, the election of a new administration, and early actions to improve revenues and 
strengthen governance, provide a valuable opportunity to address development challenges. 
The government’s plans for dealing with these challenges are laid out in the 2004-201 0 Medium 
Term Philippine Development Plan (MTPDP), released in November 2004. Developed with 
close involvement of the President and wide participation of government agencies, the MTPDP 
is based on a number of pillars that cover sector reforms and cross-cutting issues, including 
inter alia: building a performance-oriented, service-based public sector; enhancing fiscal 
discipline; enforcing anti-corruption measures; increasing investment in human resources; and 
improving overall competitiveness and private sector development. Some of the key result 
targets of the MTPDP are identified under Country Development Goals in Annex B9, as context 
for the specific goals of this CAS. 

9. 
The economic and social aspects of the reform agenda supported by this CAS are 
inseparable. The Philippines poverty reduction strategy, in fact, is integrally embodied in the 
development strategy of this CAS with its two objectives (economic growth and social inclusion) 
and two levers (fiscal stability and improved governance). Higher and sustained growth would 
need to be the major driver of poverty reduction through jobs and income creation (despite the 
lesser effect of growth on poverty reduction under high income inequality). With more social 
inclusion the poor would be empowered and enabled to participate in the opportunities afforded 
by economic growth, supported by public spending targeted to the poor as well as institutional 
reforms for market access and participation in decision processes. Fiscal reforms, in turn, are

essential for growth, for the prevention of crises that would inevitably hurt the poor severely, and 
for building-up effective social spending that reaches the poor. Finally, governance 
improvements would focus on institutional changes that let the state deliver its core services to 
all citizens, especially the poor who are often excluded. The following sections consider these 
country development challenges in more detail. 

I O . 

Growth Over the past several decades, the Philippines has not been able to enjoy the 
overall high levels of growth of other East Asian countries. With a high average annual 
population growth rate of 2.6 percent (compared to 1.7 percent in the region) over the 1961- 
2003 period, the Philippines has had a correspondingly modest 1.4 percent average annual per 
capita GDP growth rate. This compares to an average increase of 5.4 percent in per capita 
GDP for seven East Asian comparator countries over the same period. 

11. 
Economic growth in the Philippines has been on a rising path since 2001, however, 
averaging 4.5 percent in 2002-03 and accelerating to its fastest pace in 15 years of 6.1 percent 
in 2004 (reflected particularly by growth in the service sector of over 7 percent). The stronger 
growth performance since 2001 represents the confluence of several factors. The economy has 
benefited from reforms instituted in the late-I 980s. These measures have restructured the 
economy to a considerable extent, helping it to integrate more closely to regional and global 
trade and investment patterns. The Philippines has also benefited from a favorable external 
environment including: robust growth in global ITlelectronics markets which comprise over two- 
thirds of exports; stronger demand in its major markets (Japan and the US); rapid export growth 
to China; ample liquidity in government debt markets in both foreign currency and peso 
financing; and agricultural growth of about 5 percent in 2004, well above its historical norm. 

12. 
Questions remain about the sustainability of higher growth, as growth in the Philippines 
has been driven largely by consumption rather than by investment. The contribution of 
consumption to growth has been among the highest in the region, accounting for over 85 
percent of average growth in the Philippines since 1990, fueled by a high level of remittances 
from overseas Filipino workers. Remittances increased from US$1.2 billion in 1990 to US$8.3 
billion in 2004. Savings and investment as a share of GDP remain lower than other East Asian 
countries.

Real GDP per worker, a broad measure of labor productivity, increased by only 1 
percent a year on average compared to 1.4 percent in all developing countries, and 4.4 percent 
in other major East Asian e c o n om i e ~ . ~ 
(See Table 1) Similarly, growth in both physical capital 
and total factor productivity has been much lower in the Philippines. Total factor productivity 
growth was slightly negative on average over the whole period, compared to increases 
averaging 1.4 percent a year in other East Asian economies, underscoring private sector 
inefficiencies in the Philippines. 

14. 
Another key determinant of 
growth is private investment. Both 
volume and productivity of domestic 
investments and foreign direct 
investment inflows have been lower 
than other East Asian countries and 
investment horizons of private firms in 
Philippines tend to be short term. 
Between 2000 and 2004, the 
Philippine competitiveness ranking 
deteriorated, while that for Malaysia 
and Thailand improved (China and 
Singapore did not change). (See

15. 
The lackluster investment climate in the Philippines can be attributed to: a fragile fiscal 
and debt position; perceived corruption; infrastructure weaknesses; uncertainty and 
inconsistency in the application of regulations, especially in the infrastructure sector; concerns 
about law and order; the high costs of doing business; and a sluggish financial system. This 
assessment was reflected in a recent Investment Climate Survey of more than 700 firms 
conducted jointly by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Bank Group in which firms 
rated macroeconomic instability and corruption as the two main constraints. Other constraints 
commonly cited included tax administration and regulatory policy uncertainty. (See Figure 3). 

16. 
The banking system is constrained by a high level of non-performing assets, insufficient 
provisioning, and a low capital base. The Central Bank is progressively taking steps to improve 
compliance with international supervisory and regulatory practices and adopt a consolidated 
risk-based supervisory framework. Progress, however, is impeded by weak legal protection for 
examiners which limits their ability to intervene and resolve distressed banks. Moreover, bank 
secrecy laws limit supervisors’ access to deposit information. A positive development is the 
recent confirmation by the international Financial Action Task Force that the Philippines is 
effectively implementing anti-money laundering measures. 

17. 
Credit to the private sector is increasing, but only very slowly. Credit growth is muted 
because of high public sector credit demand, which offers banks relatively attractive rates and 
lower perceived risks. Thus for robust and sustainable growth, which will induce greater credit 
flows, the government will need to curb its demand for funds from the domestic financial system. 
This underscores the importance of tax and other fiscal reforms to rein in the fiscal deficit. 
Encouragingly, lending to micro and small and medium enterprises is improving. A new and 
more inclusive credit information system which is under development will help increase access 

Calculations of growth and contributions to growth in this section draw on the database in Bosworth and Collins 
(2003), which covers 22 developed and 62 developing economies over the period 1960-2000. Data for the 
Philippines was updated through 2003 by the Bank. The seven other East Asian economies referred to in this 
discussion are China, Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan (China), and Thailand.

to credit to small borrowers (especially to the poor in urban and rural areas), lower credit

Two other segments of the financial market that raise concerns are the pensions and 
pre-needs sectors, the latter providing pre-funded funeral, education, and pension/saving plans. 
The slow pace of pension reforms is disquieting and the financial condition and long-term 
sustainability of the contractual saving institutions remains tenuous.

Inadequate 
infrastructure is 
considered a serious 
constraint to investment. 
The percentage of roads 
paved in the Philippines at 
around 21 percent is lower 
than in Indonesia (46 
percent) or Thailand (97 
percent). (See Table 4)

infrastructure in the 
Philippines can be 
attributed to many of the 
same factors affecting the 
business environment. In particular, inadequate public resources and inefficient use of existing 
ones, result in few available resources for infrastructure. Maintenance of infrastructure has 
been neglected; funds allocated to road maintenance, for example, have been typically less

than 30 percent of estimated needs over the past five years, and half of the paved roads are in 
poor condition. Also, there has been weak long-term infrastructure planning by the public 
sector; major efforts have tended to be more reactive to crisis situations rather than proactive. 
And, despite their expanded mandate, local governments have not increased their expenditures 
on infrastructure. 

20. 
Experience in particular sectors, however, has demonstrated the Philippines’ ability to 
achieve striking advances under the right circumstances. The rapid growth of the electronics 
industry during the 1990s is the prime example of this. Looking forward, Philippine firms have 
tremendous opportunities to benefit from high growth in China and other East Asian countries if 
they are able to specialize in specific niche markets. In electronics hardware, for instance, the 
Philippines could become a specialized supplier to the Chinese electronics industry. In fact, this 
is already happening, with China’s imports of machinery and transport equipment from the 
Philippines (principally electronic components) surging by over 250 percent between 2001 and 
2003. 

21. 
Another promising area is the IT Enabled Services sector, which includes segments like 
call centers, business process outsourcing, transcription and translation services, content 
development (e.g., animation), and other services such as software development, and research 
and development. Growth in this sector has been high. The number of “seats” (the key 
performance indicator in the call center segment) increased from less than 4,000 in 2001, to 
around 35,000 in 2004, and by end-2005 estimated to be 60,000. Prospects going forward are 
good for this sector, thanks to the supply of an English-speaking educated workforce, relatively 
low cost of commercial space, and access to a decent telecommunication infrastructure. 

22. 
The mining sector also offers considerable potential. Mining exports declined from 
around 20 percent of exports in the mid-1970s to only a 1.6 percent average in 2000-02. A 
recent Supreme Court decision has reduced regulatory uncertainty in this sector and initial 
investor response has been very positive, with over US$3 billion of new investments identified. 
Successful development will depend very much on improving environmental and social 
practices which caused substantial problems in the past. There is also considerable potential 
for development of agribusiness, in particular for tropical fruits. In the agro industry sector 
banana production and exports increased by 83 and 53 percent, respectively, between 1997 
and 2003; fresh pineapple exports went up by 40 percent. The tourism sector also holds great 
promise given the increasing number of East Asian tourists looking for new destinations. 
International tourist arrivals in 2004 increased by more than 30 percent over 2003 and tourism 
receipts increased by more than 40 percent, but there is still tremendous growth potential given 
the country’s attractive destinations and relatively small share of tourists visiting the region. 
Good environmental management would be a key factor for exploiting the growth potential in 
this sector. 

23. 
The extent to which the Philippines will be able to exploit its considerable assets and 
achieve growth in high potential sectors will rest on its ability to improve the investment climate. 
This, in turn, requires strong public administration and governance, essential to achieving 
macroeconomic stability, enforcement of the rule of law and anticorruption measures, and 
consistent application of regulations. As part of this growth agenda, the MTPDP recognizes that 
over the medium term the private sector will play an increasing role in financing of infrastructure 
projects. Hence, the plan’s emphasis on improving public-private partnerships in infrastructure 
provision is appropriate (e.g., review the Build-Operations-Transfer law and its implementing 
rules and regulations). Improving the investment climate will also be linked to strengthening the 
regulatory capacity and effective protection against non-competitive practices. Stronger public 
sector management and regulatory capacity will also be critical for protecting the environment to 

7 

foster sustainable growth in tourism and mining, and for city planning to ease traffic and make 
urban centers more attractive. 

24. 
Social lnclusion Lack of social inclusion is a serious obstacle to development, one 
that is closely linked to the country’s economic and social challenges (as discussed in 
paragraph 9 on the framework for poverty reduction in the Philippines). Inequality remains high 
in the Philippines. Coupled with low growth over the longer term, this has translated into slow 
progress on poverty reduction. The richest 5 percent of households account for nearly one third 
of national income, while the poorest 20 percent accounts for only 6 percent. (See Figure 5 ) 
Maybe as a result of unequal distribution of incomes and opportunities, many Filipinos, 
especially the poor, are skeptical of economic reforms since they are unable to reap the benefits 
of growth. Moreover, they are often not involved in the decision-making process. Thus the 
ability of the state to take collective decisions 
and provide public goods and services is 
impaired.

Distribution of Income

25. 
The incidence of poverty, based on 
household consumption, has declined 
marginally from 27.6 percent in 2000 to 26.1 
percent in 2003, after an increase of 2 
percentage points between 1997 and 2000.4 
Poverty severity remained about the same 
between 2000 and 2003 (living standards of 
those who remained poor have not improved). 
Between 2000 and 2003, poverty incidence fell 
in most (1 1 out of 16) regions, 4 t h the 
exception of the Mindanao and CARAGA 
regions. The highest poverty incidences in 2003 were found in the Autonomous Region in 
Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) at 61 percent and Western Mindanao at 49 percent, followed closely 
by Bicol and Eastern Visayas at around 45 percent.

Household 

26. 
Poverty is highest in the agriculture sector and the sector also experienced the slowest 
poverty reduction. Agriculture-dependent households account for over two-thirds of the poor 
while they represent only 40 percent of the population. The self-employed and the wage 
earners in the sector are equally likely to be poor. The incidence of poverty declined twice as 
rapidly among households dependent on industry and services than on agriculture. Educational 
attainment is a key determinant of poverty. Over three quarters of the poor lived in households 
where the head had no more than an elementary education. 

27. 
Notwithstanding small progress on the poverty front, persistent high income inequality 
implies that the poor do not share many of the income benefits generated by growth. In addition 
to the lack of growth-related employment opportunities (unemployment rate was about 12 
percent in 2004), the poor are often unable to access quality public services. For example, less 
than 10 percent of the lowest 20 percent has access to adequate infrastructure services. This 
implies that the poor are receiving little or no service, and therefore likely to be benefiting less 
from national government programs and subsidies. Moreover, wide income disparities among 
regions can be attributed, in part, to regional differences in the level of infrastructure 

The poverty estimates are based on household consumption. The consumption-based poverty line of 
US$0.72/person/day is constructed to reflect a consumption basket of basic-needs, consisting of a food basket 
that provides 2,000 calories per person per day valued at consumer prices in each province, plus a basket of 
non-food spending.

development. The country's poorest region, the ARMM, has the country's lowest level of access 
to safe water, electricity and sanitation, as well as the lowest road density level in the c o ~ n t r y . ~ 

28. 
Environmental degradation is a significant contributor to poverty, inequality, and loss of 
livelihood. The Philippines is one of the most hazard prone countries in the world, and natural 
disasters have been aggravated by environmental degradation. The impact of environmental 
degradation is acutely felt by the rural population, the majority of whom live either in the uplands 
or the coastal fringe and substantially relies on their habitat's natural resources for their 
sustenance. Pressures on these resources, however, mean that only about 7.2 million hectares 
remain forested, compared with 21 million in the early 1900s. Similarly, fish stock has declined 
and nearly all of the coral reefs are under medium to high threat by environmental pressures.' 
In urban areas, air and water pollution continue to escalate due to weak enforcement of 
industrial regulatory policies, exacerbated by overcrowding and an increase in slum areas. 
Related to these social costs, the deterioration of the environment also constrains productivity 
and economic growth, particularly in such high potential growth sectors as agriculture and 
tourism. 

29. 
Low incomes among the poor are aggravated by low outcomes for other social 
indicators. Infant and under-five mortality rates are 2.3 and 2.7 times higher, respectively, for 
households in the poorest 20 percent compared to those in the richest 20 percent. School 
enrollment rates are 28 percent lower in the poorest group compared to the richest; similarly, 
female literacy rates (age 15-49) are 9 percent lower for the poorest group compared to the 
richest. Geographic disparities in health and education outcomes also remain high. The 
average life expectancy of adults in the ARMM region in 2000, for example, is 10 years lower 
that the national level and is at the comparable national level reached in 1970. Elementary 
school enrollment rates in the ARMM are around 10 percentage points lower than rates in the 
rest of the country; female literacy (age 15-49) is 15 percentage points lower. 

30. 
Education outcomes in the 
Philippines are low compared to the rest of 
the East Asia region. The Philippines 
ranked nearly last in student performance 
on mathematics and science tests (See 
Table 6). In addition, about one third of 
those who enter grade one and about one 
quarter of those who enter first year high 
school do not reach the last grade in the 
cycle. High population growth rates and a 
tight fiscal situation contribute to these 
outcomes. 

31. 
The Philippines is likely to reach 
several of the Millennium Development 
Goals (MDGs), including reducing the

maternal mortality, contraceptive prevalence, and other policies to address very high population 
growth. (See Box 1) Progress on addressing child malnutrition has been particularly weak, 
declining only from about 34 percent of children (0-5 years) underweight in 1990 to 28 percent 
in 2003, far above the MDG target of around 17 percent for 2015. Placing the Philippines back 
on track to realize these MDGs will require better growth and employment opportunities, as well 
as concerted efforts to improve the delivery of basic public services to the poor. 

32. 
Finally, social exclusion is manifest in, and reinforced by social conflicts in Mindanao and 
in other parts of the country, as well as a sense of a lack of personal security.’ (See Box 2) 
While public decision-making is formally open to all members of society, the effective 
participation of the poor and other marginalized groups is often limited. Their diminished social 
inclusion and sense of disenfranchisement make policy making, especially the implementation 
of hard reforms, all the more difficult because many groups of the population may not expect to 
share in the benefits of public services and reforms. 

33. 
Allowing the poor and vulnerable groups to benefit more from the gains of economic 
growth requires significant investments in human development. The MTPDP’s focus on key 
anti-poverty areas will be important, namely: acceleration of asset reform; provision of human 
development and social services (health and education); livelihood and employment; social 
protection and security from violence; and participation of the poor in decision-making. 

34. 
Fiscal Stability A weak fiscal position is the main cause of concern regarding public 
finances and macroeconomic stability. Non-Financial Public Sector (NFPS) debt has grown at 
an unsustainable pace in recent years, exceeding 101 percent of GDP in 2003. Debt of the 
national government was nearly five times its revenue, significantly higher than average ratios 
for emerging markets. Interest payments of the national government reached 5.4 percent of 
GDP in 2004, and total public sector interest payments are estimated at about 7 percent of 
GDP. While the debt profile has been carefully managed and pushed out to longer maturities, 
the public sector’s borrowing requirement remains high. Until debt levels and financing 
requirements are brought down, the Philippines will remain vulnerable to shifts in investor 
sentiment and market conditions. 

35. 
The rapid increase in NFPS debt has been driven by large deficits due primarily to 
declining tax collection, and rising power sector losses through 2004. Tax revenue dropped 
from 17 percent of GDP in 1997 to 12.3 percent in 2004. Several measures to strengthen tax 
administration were taken during the past two years, which slowed but did not stop the decline 
in tax effort. Poor tax collection reflects both policy and administrative weaknesses. VAT 
exemptions, for example, remain significant, with dispensation for select groups (e.g., 
independent power producers, lawyers, doctors). Despite the perception of widespread tax 
evasion, successful prosecution has, up to now, been rare. 

36. 
Public debt figures reflect not only past deficits, but also the calling of numerous 
contingent claims on government and bailouts of government-owned corporations. But NFPS 
debt does not include existing contingent liabilities of the government arising from such 
commitments as: guarantees on risks from build-operate-transfer contracts; currency risks 
associated with foreign loans intermediated by government financial institutions; liquidity support 
to troubled banks; and future obligations of the government-run contractual savings system. Of 
particular concern are the finances of the social security system, which given the present 
package of benefits and contributions is expected to suffer increasing losses and eventually 
deplete its assets in about ten years. 

Crime, theft, and disorder were considered to be a major constraint to business by over 25 percent of firms 
surveyed in the 2004 Investment Climate Survey. 

10 

37. 
The country’s tenuous fiscal and debt situation is ultimately the result of deeper causes 
related to weak public institutions and a frail social contract, discussed earlier. The difficulties 
faced by the state in improving its revenues not only undermines macroeconomic stability, but it 
also has profound implications for human development and growth prospects. Spending on 
essential services has suffered from expenditure compression. Public sector investments 
declined from 3.3 to 2.8 percent of GDP during 2000-03. Since 1997 real per capita spending 
by the national government on education and health has fallen by 19 and 43 percent, 
respectively, causing deterioration in these services. Public investment as a share of GDP 

11 

remains among the lowest in the region. High domestic and external public financing 
requirements have driven spreads upwards and increased risk premia for the country. 
Emerging Market Bond Index spreads for the Philippines stand at about 500 basis points (as of 
early 2005). The high interest income from government bonds, coupled with their zero risk 
weighting for bank capital requirements, have created a corresponding disincentive for banks to 
lend to the private sector. 

38. Overall, a considerable upfront fiscal adjustment will be essential to send a strong and 
credible signal to the domestic and international financial markets that the government -- both 
the executive and legislative branches -- is committed to serious reform. This would improve 
policy credibility and lower perceived risks by investors, yielding direct benefits of lower interest 
rates, a stronger peso, and higher investment and growth. The subsequent savings in financing 
costs alone would be large enough to support funding for several of the improvements in 
services and infrastructure identified in the MTPDP. 
39. 
Recent progress is encouraging -- actions to increase excise taxes and adjust power 
tariffs, as well as progress in Congress on revenue bills have sent a positive signal about the 
ability to enact policy. In addition to reducing public spending in response to revenue 
constraints, the government has also implemented a process to review budget proposals 
against core agency mandates and performance indicators Of course not all necessary actions 
can be initiated simultaneously and many will require further consensus building and 
Congressional action. 

Figure 7: 
Governance Indicators Among East Asian Countries 

40. 
The MTPDP outlines several legislative and administrative measures to improve the 
fiscal situation. Beyond the VAT reform, these measures include raising petroleum excise taxes 
and rationalizing the present configuration of fiscal incentives. Equally important, tax 
administration needs to be strengthened, specifically actions to reduce corruption, improve 
discipline, and recognize and reward integrity in the revenue agencies. In addition to revenue 
enhancement, the government aims at 
imposing greater discipline in 
Government-Owned and Controlled 
Corporations (GOCC) financing; 
addressing contingent liabilities, 
particularly related to the power sector 
and pension obligations; and making 
adjustments in inter-governmental 
finances. The MTPDP also includes 
measures to rationalize government 
spending, improve budget allocation, 
and streamline the bureaucracy. 
4 1 . 
Institutions The issue of governance 
in the Philippines presents another 
paradox. The country enjoys an active 
and vocal civil society, open media, and 
vibrant public debate. In addition, the 
public administration benefits from 
many highly competent individuals, 
especially at the top levels of the 
bureaucracy. Despite these attributes, 
there remains a strong perception of 
“capture of the state” that biases public decision-making towards favoring narrow interests.

Indeed, governance indicators from a cross-country database indicate that, despite democratic 
processes, rule of law, political stability, and control of corruption are lower in the Philippines 
than in other East Asian comparator economies. (See Figure 7) 

42. 
Like other countries, the Philippines is 
in a transition from traditional, clientilistic 
governance towards a modern state in which 
citizens provide resources to, and vest powers 
in their government in return for accountability 
for the delivery of public goods and services. 
The country is seeking to build a stronger state, 
not necessarily a bigger one, which can raise 
adequate public finance and deliver public 
goods and services efficiently. As the 
experience of many of its East Asian neighbors 
illustrate, a stronger state is a precondition for 
robust private-sector-driven growth and greater 
social inclusion. 

“A consensus has also emerged in the past decade 
among scholars that, first, the Philippines has had a 
weak state; and, second, that the weakness of the 
Philippine state has been the country’s overarching 
problem that explains its inability to develop the 
economy and alleviate poverty. There are two 
essential attributes of a strong state. First, it is 
autonomous of dominant classes and sectors, so 
that it represents the people’s interest, both minority 
and powerful groups. Second, it has the capacity, 
represented mainly through a strong bureaucracy, to 
implement its policies. I’

Macapagal-Arroyo, Newsbreak magazine, January 6 ,2003 

43. 
Progress is slowly being made to improve the effectiveness of the state. Innovative 
approaches are being taken to strengthen public institutions and constrain graft and corruption. 
The “Lifestyle Checks” of public servants which has been adopted formally by the National 
Office of the Ombudsman and the consequent dismissal of several senior level bureaucrats 
have sent a clear message that ill-gotten wealth will be prosecuted. (See Box 3) The 
implementation of landmark procurement legislation is helping improve transparency and 
accountability in government contracting. 

44. 
Various home-grown efforts at reshaping public sector agencies have been initiated 
including most prominently the recent promulgation of Executive Order 366 authorizing the 
rationalization of the bureaucracy in order to reduce the fiscal burden and improve the delivery 
of public services. At the local level, the passage of the Local Government Code in 1991 has 
led to the emergence of a significant number of well-performing local governments. There have 
in fact already been several instances in which well-governed LGUs have radiated their success 
by influencing other LGUs. Similarly, community-driven development programs like Kalahi- 
ClDDs which promote transparency and community involvement in decision-making, have 
become powerful motivators for changing “business as usual” at the local level. The agenda 
going forward will need to build on such initiatives to improve governance, reduce corruption, 
and ultimately reenergize the social contract. 
45. 
It will be important to encourage and support positive domestic experiences -- “islands of 
good governance”-- that demonstrate how progress can be made within the context of the 
Philippines and can potentially create spillover effects. When citizens see concrete benefits, 
they will be more willing to vest authority and provide resources for their public institutions. 
Moreover, when public institutions (e.g., regulatory bodies) become more effective, the private 
sector will make productive investments and devote increasingly less resources to unproductive 
rent-seeking activities. The result: a virtuous cycle. 

13 

Country Directions 

46. 
The Philippines is at a critical juncture, facing a window of opportunity to address its 
development challenges. The beginning of a six year term for the new government could 
become a turning point toward creating a favorable policy environment. Implementing 
reforms will, of course, be politically challenging. Indeed, since the beginning of the current 
administration the reform agenda has already generated a much welcome and lively discussion 
and an emerging sense of an impending crisis if actions are not taken. Widespread acceptance 
of the reform program will depend upon how well the benefits of reform, as well as the downside 
risks of no reform, are communicated to the public. Citizens will need to know that the initial 
burdens of reform are shared across all sectors and classes of society. Most importantly, the 
public will need to have confidence that the reforms will strengthen governance and that 
government will be held to account. In this regard, the success of the administration’s anti- 
corruption drive and efforts to prosecute tax evaders will be critical. (See Box 3) 
An effective reform effort - specifically a more aggressive reduction in the public sector 
47. 
deficit -would help sustain the strong pace of growth attained in 2004. Reducing the public 
sector deficit by about 3 percent of GDP during 2005-07 would lead to significantly improved 

14 

perceptions of stability, as measured, for example, by debt sustainability indicators and bond 
spreads. Private investment would likely increase because concerns about macroeconomic 
vulnerability would ease. With improved investor sentiment, higher private investment could fuel 
economic growth to an average of at least 6 percent per year. Under this scenario in which a 
virtuous cycle is achieved, the NFPS debt would fall significantly by about 25 percentage points 
of GDP, from its current level (2003) of 101 percent of GDP. The ability to take a more 
aggressive fiscal adjustment would likely reflect greater political consensus and thus be 
accompanied by faster improvements in tax administration, expenditure management, and civil 
service reform. 

48. With more public resources and greater effectiveness of social expenditures, the higher 
growth, thanks to a favorable policy direction, would have a significant impact on poverty 
reduction. If the Philippines can sustain growth of 6 percent per year with rapid employment 
generation, the proportion of the population living on less than US$2 per day could be reduced 
from 47 percent in 2000 to around 30 percent by 2010, and some 15 million more Filipinos 
would rise above the poverty line of US$2 per day, with associated improvements in social 
outcomes. 

49. 
The country has taken important steps toward the virtuous cycle described above, 
underlying the high growth path. However, implementation of the needed reforms will face 

many challenges. Gradual progress in the policy environment would imply reducing the 

public sector deficit over the next three years and continued efforts to enhance public sector 
management, including improved tax administration, civil service reform, broadening 
implementation of the procurement law, and strengthening judicial functioning. 

50. 
But in this situation the gradual pace of reforms is not enough to create the necessary 
momentum to make increased tax efforts and improvements in government spending sufficient 
and sustainable and thus attain a virtuous cycle. These factors, together with the expectation 
that the external environment will be less favorable and that agricultural growth will return to 
historical patterns, could lead to a moderate growth path of about 3 to 4 percent per year during 
the 2006-08 CAS period. 

51. 
Negative policy circumstances, by contrast, would likely reflect gridlock in government 
and lack of political consensus, undermining progress on fiscal and public sector reforms. 
Without a concerted effort to contain public deficits, the public debtlGDP ratio could continue 
upward. This could also create pressure to rollback progress made in other areas such as 
trade, financial sector, and regulatory policies, further undermining growth. Ultimately public 
resources for infrastructure and human development would become even more constrained. A 
reversal of progress on the policy agenda and fiscal adjustment could trigger a cycle of higher 
deficits and debt, reduced access to external finance, and thus add to financial market volatility. 

52. 

Such a negative situation is unlikely to be sustainable as the country would continue to 
remain vulnerable to shifting investor attitudes and the external environment. In particular, the 
Philippines remains susceptible to deterioration in investor sentiment given high public sector 
amortization requirements, a relatively open capital account, and the concerns expressed by a 
number of international banks and credit rating agencies about the slow pace of fiscal 
adjustment. A damaging shift in sentiment could possibly be triggered by external shocks such 
as higher oil prices or a decline in the export market to China; social or political disruptions that 
would distract from the policy agenda or merely perceptions of growing policy drift; and with 
local banks’ growing exposure to the government, a fiscal crisis could envelope the banking 
system as well. Protracted conflict in Mindanao or a deterioration of the general social and 
security situation could interact with economic vulnerabilities and further undermine investor 

15 

confidence. Clearly, this is a direction that the Philippines will have to avoid if it is to achieve its 
development potential. 

16 

II. The Bank Group and Philippines Partnership 

Lessons Learned and Messages from Stakeholders 

53. 
The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY2006-08 builds on the lessons of the past 
and the messages heard during a series of consultations and client survey with a wide range of 
stakeholders. The CAS Completion Report reviews the Bank Group’s8 effectiveness over the 
past five years and indicates that the Bank Group supported several key country development 
objectives, including: expansion of basic infrastructure in rural areas; reconstruction efforts in 
Mindanao; and improving procurement and financial processes in several key agencies. (See 
Annex 1) Extensive CAS stakeholder consultations and a client survey revealed that the 
institution’s knowledge resources, technical assistance, and information sharing are particularly 
valued. The Bank Group’s outreach efforts to involve civil society and beneficiaries in project 
preparation and implementation are considered especially successful. (See Annex 2) 

54. 
The CAS preparation also drew extensively from a series of formal and informal 
meetings with a broad range of stakeholders. Small meetings were held with key opinion 
leaders from various sectors and with government officials from oversight and implementing 
agencies. Separate meetings were held with bilateral and multilateral development agencies. 
Large workshops involved national and local governments; civil society; the business 
community/private sector; academia; labor groups; and other development partners. The Bank 
Group also held workshops around the country with youth representatives. Through these small 
and large gatherings, the Bank Group heard the views of its various stakeholders. In many of 
these fora, the imperative to make public institutions work for the common good was 
emphasized, raising the question of whether our assistance can be more strategically focused 
towards this objective. 

55. While the feedback suggests that the Bank Group’s contributions have been valuable 
and much appreciated, it also indicates that international development partners, including the 
Bank Group, may have fallen short of their potential impact. This perception mirrors, and is 
likely related to, the perception of the country’s own development shortfall. The lessons learned 
include the following: 
0 Both the government and the Bank Group have, at times, been tempted to pursue an 
overly-ambitious policy reform agenda. Complex plans have been developed by highly 
capable counterparts only to fall short during implementation, often after responsibility 
had passed on to other individuals. This applies to overall economic reform as well as to 
sector reforms, for example in health and energy. A key lesson calls for less complex 
designs and greater focus on implementation of future reform efforts, supported in 
particular by development policy lending or reform-oriented investment lending. 
The Bank’s proposed support for fiscal reform was not achieved, due to lack of progress 
on reducing the public deficit, thus preventing adjustment lending. Further, Bank 
investment lending (still often perceived as financing outside the government’s core 
program) was severely constrained by the tight fiscal situation even though it could have 
substantially benefited the country through low-cost financing as well as technical 
contributions by the Bank. The key lesson is the need to align Bank lending more 
closely to the priorities expressed in the government’s own investment program and 
finance priority expenditures within the existing national budget in support of a well-

defined program of reforms. This requires a shift away from financing discrete projects 
toward more programmatic engagement with selected key agencies. 
Many sectoral projects and programs supported by the Bank and other international 
development partners directly or indirectly work with or through LGUs. A number of 
these programs have led to fragmentation of financing and procedures that do not 
necessarily strengthen the ability of LGUs to determine and pursue their own 
development priorities. Moreover, the national government is reviewing its approach 
toward the financing of local government activities through on-lending and on-granting. 
These factors have led to a slowdown in implementation and approval of support for 
locally implemented projects while the demand for support from LGUs and their 
relevance to the development agenda have in fact increased. The key lesson is the 
need for an approach that encourages LGUs to pursue and finance their own 
development priorities, but at the same time allows the national government to use 
separate instruments to pursue national development objectives and priorities requiring 
strong local implementation and partnership between national and local governments. 
While there have been examples of good collaboration across the organizations of the 
Bank Group, there is a perception of unexploited synergies in creating successful 
models of public-private partnership, particularly in infrastructure. The key lesson is the 
need for closer integration of operational approaches of the Bank Group members. 
The previous CAS attempted to identify results based on broad and multiple strategic 
objectives. With hindsight, such a wide-ranging approach proved to be a difficult 
framework for assessing the effectiveness of Bank Group contributions. The key 
lessons are to: further strengthen the results focus of the CAS and make it a more 
effective management tool; focus on less ambitious yet more monitorable result 
indicators; and distinguish between country-level results, CAS-level results, and program 
level results. 

56. 
Throughout the development of this CAS, the Bank Group team has struggled to directly 
address the identified obstacles and integrate these lessons in order to make a relevant 
contribution toward the two primary objectives of the Bank’s mission -- economic growth and 
social inclusion. The strategy described below seeks to respond, a challenge that will no doubt 
continue beyond this CAS period. 

Overview of Engagement Strategy 

57. 
The Philippines could attain substantially better development outcomes given the 
available ingredients for more rapid development, as outlined in Chapter 1. These better 
outcomes, however, will require strong and sustained policy implementation. Discouraged by 
slow progress on policy reforms, the Bank, as well as other development partners, has scaled 
back its program over the years. There is no question that the impact of the Bank and other 
development partners’ support has been disappointing in some areas. We are, nonetheless, 
confident that we can contribute toward country development outcomes substantially more than 
our relatively small financial role would suggest. To this end, we intend to be proactive and help 
address critical underlying institutional problems. The country is receptive to Bank Group 
support and, encouragingly, many of those stakeholders consulted expressed confidence and 
high expectations for the Bank Group’s role. Meeting these expectations will require a 
continuing strong presence and program in the Philippines. 

58. 
To achieve the desired outcomes on growth and social inclusion, this assistance 
program will need to be more strategically focused on addressing two key levers: fiscal reforms 
as the essential short-term challenge; and more effective public institutions as the critical 

governance and financing within the 
existing budget will require an 

19 

To achieve greater impact in the Philippines -- especially helping to improve the 
61. 
governance of public institutions - - the full range of our instruments need to be better integrated, 
leveraged, and used more flexibly. This requires that we exploit our comparative advantage to 
work at both the macro and sector levels; use our analytical work to inform our lending and 
policy dialogue; combine international best practice with in-depth local knowledge (thanks to a 
substantial in-country presence); offer a range of financial and guarantee products at more 
attractive terms than commercial sources; and continue to play an honest broker role. Our 
engagement must also be consistent with the severe fiscal constraints and realities faced by the 
government. 

62. 
The assistance strategy implies a “back to basics” approach: on the margin, focusing 
more on the ability of agencies to deliver services on the ground and make real implementation 
progress, rather than on sophisticated reform design. We will be realistic about the relatively 
modest role of the Bank Group in building good governance. Our success will depend upon 
how we are able to help replicate and scale-up experiences in which the public sector effectively 
delivers on its social contract. The strategy will require that we be more selective in approach 
but opportunistic in specific engagements within the chosen approach. Moreover, selectivity 
under this CAS is functional and not sectoral. We will focus on “islands of good governance” -- 
national agencies, local governments, or economic sectors for which the basic governance 
arrangements are sufficiently sound to provide a reasonable chance of success. 

National Platform 

63. 
The national platform reflects a transition from a project-based approach towards a 
program-based one which offers greater flexibility with lower transactions costs. Our program 
will move us closer to supporting the government’s own priority needs and away from 
disaggregated project-oriented financing which the government cannot afford given the fiscal 
constraints. By offering within budget financing, the Bank Group will be better placed to support 
improvements in the capacity of national government agencies to deliver their core mandates. 

.

Figure 9: 
National Platform 

64 . 

The Bank Group's national 
platform will provide financing to 
agencies which show promise for 
becoming examples of fiscal 
responsibility and good 
governance. This should lead to 
improved service delivery. Our 
program comprises a combination 
of cross-sector and sector-specific 
investment operations and non- 
lending activities, illustrated in 
Figure 9.

Cross-Sector 

65. 
Engagement The government 
has been undertaking a number of 
efforts to strengthen finances and 
service delivery, often with support 
from the Bank Group. In this CAS, 
Bank Group support for cross- 
sector activities could address the 
following government priorities: 
fiscal reforms: 
implement measures to improve tax policy and administration and 
address contingent liabilities (in the social security system and the GOCCs, including the 
power sector); 
budget and expenditure reforms: 
focus on core mandates and functions, service 
delivery improvements, and performance-based budgeting, using sector efficiency 
reviews and identifying measures of Major Final Outputs for key departments. An 
important performance measure is citizen satisfaction with government services; 
civil service reforms: establish merit-based performance processes, financing 
incentives for departing employees, and modernization of the compensation regime; 
streamlining of agency staffing: permit more targeting of staff and expenditures to core 
functions and services delivery; 
procurement reform: enhance capacity of new Procurement Policy Board to provide 
oversight and monitoring, support the civil society monitoring of bid and award 
committees, strengthen the internal procurement audit function of government agencies 
and establish a framework to assess the progress and effectiveness of the public 
procurement reforms, and continue to build capacity for the use of the recently 
harmonized bidding documents; 
anti-corruption measures: 
increase capacity of government agencies to more effectively 
respond to corrupt practices (e.g., National Office of the Ombudsman, Supreme Court).

66. 
The basic thrust of our support will be in line with our ongoing policy dialogue in these 
areas, consistent with the key reform goals of the new administration for which many building 
blocks are already in place (e.g., new procurement procedures, the development of Major Final 
Outputs, and a new national government accounting system).' In this regard, the criterion for 
Bank Group assistance would be tied to the quality and implementation of reforms, as well as 

See Development Policy Review (2005) and the Discussion Briefs (2004). 

21 

for groups that show the most promise of becoming islands of good governance. Our support 
will encompass a range of ongoing and new analytical and advisory activities. In particular, 
Bank budget and trust fund grants will support continued technical assistance on such subjects 
as: public sector expenditure and debt management; banking supervision; pension reform; civil 
service reform; procurement reform; and strengthening the Office of the Ombudsman. 

67. 
An important element of our cross-sectoral approach is a possible investment operation 
to support civil service reform in several agencies, with emphasis on performance-based 
objectives and outcomes. The proposed National Program Support for Public Expenditure 
Rationalization would provide financial support for Executive Order 366 which outlines a plan to 
induce voluntary departures from national agencies through voluntary separation packages. Its 
success depends on development of restructuring plans for each agency which identify 
rationalization opportunities with clear benefits in improved service delivery. 

68. 
If conditions are appropriate, the Bank could provide development policy lending, which 
offer quicker disbursing funds. (See Chapter 3) This could support cross-sectoral reform efforts 
in the areas of tax policy and administration, public sector expenditure management including 
civil service reform, banking and pension systems, the power sector, investment climate, and 
capital markets, among other possibilities. 
69. We will also support another critical cross-sectoral objective of the government - 
improving devolution of national government functions to LGUs. By freeing-up resources now 
being spent by national agencies on devolved functions, the agencies would be better able to 
focus their support on helping LGUs increase their own capacity to take on those functions 
(discussed below in the section on the local platform). 

Sector-Specific Engagement 

70. 
In addition to addressing the cross-sectoral issues, our 
national platform will provide national program support to specific sector agencies, based on the 
following principles: 
use programmatic support, within the existing budget, for the agency’s most effective 
programs, focusing on core mandates and functions; 
assist well-articulated plans for strengthening agency effectiveness and service delivery; 
support efforts, where possible, to strengthen country systems for environment and 
social safeguards, procurement, fiduciary control, fund allocation, and accountability 
across the agency, rather than limited to project transactions; 
up-scale successful earlier project experiences (e.g., in education); and 
connect with cross-cutting programs (e.g., E0366 and the proposed National Program 
Support for Public Expenditure Rationalization project). 

71, 
Depending upon the readiness of sector agencies for reform and rationalization, these 
national program support operations would take a sector-wide approach (SWAP) to well- 
performing or reforming entities over a period of years. (See Box 4) Applying the principles 
noted above, such national program support operations would clearly specify development 
objectives and would focus on resource prioritization and management -- improving service 
delivery through better policy, planning, budgeting, and monitoring & evaluation systems. In 
addition, national program support operations would address such agency-specific issues as 
expenditure prioritization, staffing mix, incentives/ compensation, accountability, and 
performance management. Possible candidates for national program support projects include: 
the Department of Education (DepEd), the Department of Agriculture (DA), the Department of 
Public Works and Highways (DPWH), the Department of Social Welfare and Development 

22 

(DSWD), and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), building on and 
broadening in many cases ongoing operations in support of these agencies. Where 
appropriate, a sector project could be linked to restructuring efforts under the proposed National 
Program Support for Public Expenditure Rationalization project. 

72. 
Progress is already being made for the preparation of a multi-financier SWAP with the 
Department of Health (DOH). The proposed National Program Support for Health project would 
assist the DOH and selected provinces to implement the government’s health sector reform 
agenda. This SWAP operation would be undertaken in coordination with several development 
partners and would provide budgetary support for the department’s financial management and 
procurement reforms, performance-based budgeting, and re-engineering of DOH regional 
offices to promote effective decentralization of the health system. 

Local Platform 

73. 
The Local Government Code of 1991 devolved service responsibilities and revenue 
authority to LGUs, placing them at the forefront of development and poverty alleviation. A 
remarkable outcome of the new code has been the emergence of good models of LGU 
performance and service delivery under dynamic local leadership, as recognized by programs 
such as the Galing Pook Award and the Asian Institute of Management‘s Competitiveness 
Ranking. Successful and well-managed LGUs have become a visible example of islands of 
good governance. These LGUs not only inspire neighboring LGUs, but in a few cases they 
have achieved a track-record of performance across several administrations, thus showing 
some signs of institutionalization of good governance. Some analysts consider these 
successful LGUs as the most promising seed for the modernization of public institutions and the 
adoption of good governance practices in the Philippines. 

74. 
This CAS intends to support a strand of LGUs committed to performance improvement 
by helping them to achieve a cycle of improved service provision which in turn generates 
citizens’ trust and increased resources to the public sector. These LGUs will serve as replicable 
models for an emerging culture of service delivery and a stronger social contract. At the same 
time, Bank Group support will help streamline and structure the government’s broader policy 
approach towards all LGUs, including relatively weaker ones, in order to create conditions for 
them to join the ranks of the stronger and well-managed LGUs. Overall, our assistance will 
support decentralization by empowering 
LGU decision-making and supporting 
LGU-led programs. This emphasis 
reflects a shift to dealing with LGUs as 
clients, rather than implementers of 
national projects. 

Figure I O : 

75. 
Our local strategy is outlined in 
Figure 10. It will be based on a clear 
performance and capacity framework, to 
be developed jointly with the national 
agencies, LGUs, various other 
stakeholders, and development partners. 
The performance and capacity framework 
will guide the technical assistance 
program and the selection of financing 
instruments offered to LGUs - national 
govern men t , govern men t financial 
institutions, and/or private financing 

23 

(discussed below). Each element of the framework embodies incentives to increase the LGUs’ 
own-sourced revenue; this is fundamental for achieving sustainability and ultimately the CAS 
goals. 

76. 
Performance and Capacity Framework Benchmarking LGUs through a credible, 
commonly-accepted performance framework will be key to strengthening LGU accountability, 
thereby reinforcing the decentralization process. Correspondingly, LGUs need to increase their 
capacity, particularly in the areas of governance, local service delivery, and investment planning 
and preparation. LGU capacity building programs will be more effective if closely associated 
with a performance framework. 

77. 
The key elements of the performance and capacity building framework would include: 
revenue mobilization, planning and budgeting, fiduciary control systems, and local service 
delivery. In all these areas, participatory approaches would be encouraged to promote greater 
transparency and accountability in local government decision making. During CAS 
consultations, stakeholders strongly endorsed such a framework, but also voiced quite strong 
preference for it to be implemented independently outside the government system. 

78. 
Technical Assistance To help build LGU performance and capacity, the Bank Group 
will provide technical assistance to support core governance capacity building, sector-specific 
competencies, and LGU capacity in preparing and implementing investment projects. The core 
governance capacity building program will be closely linked to the performance framework, 
aiming to assist LGUs in attaining governance improvements measurable according to the 
framework. Our technical assistance in this area will draw on our close partnerships with the 
leagues of local governments that have been nurtured through the Bank and Cities Alliance- 
supported City Development Strategies program. The World Bank Institute (WBI), local training 
institutions, and international development partners are expected to play an active role in the 
program and should coordinate their respective programs. For LGU investment projects, the 
Bank will help LGUs develop the ability to prepare feasibility studies, designs, and procurement 
packages suitable for financing. 

79. 
It is envisaged that the national agencies will offer better and a greater range of technical 
assistance to LGUs. This reflects the transition of national agencies from implementing services 
that have been devolved to LGUs to instead, providing technical assistance to LGUs to execute 
their own sector programs and investments. This represents the link between the CAS’ local 
and national platforms -- by helping to develop sector-specific competencies of national 
agencies, LGUs will benefit from improved support. 

80. 
While technical assistance and other support to LGUs from the Bank Group, bilateral 
and multilateral development agencies, and the national government has been good, it has 
been fragmented. Some of these programs are supply-driven, often overlapping, tied to specific 
program needs, and inconsistent with each other. This fragmentation undermines planning and 
capacity at the local level. To address this, a Development Partners Working Group on 
Decentralization and Local Government, which has been created to work with the Department of 
Interior and Local Governments and other government agencies, will help promote consistency 
among technical assistance activities provided through a range of loan, grant, government, and 
development partner programs. To reflect core concerns and ensure ownership, this work will 
involve extensive consultations with LGUs, national government agencies, NGOs, academic 
institutions, and development partners. 

81. 
National Government Financing The Local Platform will support the government’s 
efforts in rationalizing inter-government transfer arrangements to LGUs. This is a complex 

24 

process and the Bank Group is helping the national government sketch the options for doing 
this. 

82. 
The evolving financing framework for LGUs could eventually include a significant role for 
conditional transfers. Conditional grant financing would support national priorities and public 
goods (e.g., environment, public health). Sector based grants, channeled through sectoral 
departments of the national government, can be used to provide incentives for LGUs to achieve 
performance improvements in priority sectors. The grant programs in this area (such as the 
National Program Support for Mindanao Rural Development 2 project and the National Program 
Support for Health project) would be on a matching basis, requiring counterpart LGU funding, 
either from borrowing or from own-source revenue. Grants could also be targeted to LGUs with 
the poorest communities and would thus receive minimum support for poverty alleviation. The 
government is also considering the possibility of a performance-based, cross-sectoral, 
conditional grant program, for which LGUs would receive funding linked to pre-determined 
performance criteria based on governance. 

83. 
For the poorest municipalities, the national government provides matching grants using 
a community driven-development (CDD) approach, which promotes local-level collective action 
for empowerment and poverty reduction. In the Bank-supported Kalahi-CIDSS program, for 
example, the DSWD directly transfers grants to local communities in the poorest municipalities. 
Communities then follow a planning and implementation process that is managed by DSWD in 
cooperation with LGUs. As LGUs develop greater commitment and capacity to implement the 
key principles of the Kalahi-CIDSS program - participation, accountability, transparency, and 
shared responsibility for costs - LGUs (rather than the national DSWD) are meant to take 
increasing responsibility for managing the interaction with communities and adopting the CDD 
approach as a way to allocate resources and make decisions at the local level. 

84. 
According to a Bank evaluation, the CDD approach is an important feature in almost half 
of the Bank's current portfolio. While the basic objectives of such projects are the same, the 
mechanisms used to achieve the objectives differ significantly. While there may be legitimate 
reasons why approaches are different, too many different approaches are likely to lead to 
confusion, duplication, and inefficiency, especially when several Bank-financed projects overlap 
in the same LGU. Conflicting advice and capacity building programs in different projects with 
varying standards for preparing and implementing community activities can also place an undue 
burden on local capacities. Where possible, many aspects of CDD projects would benefit from 
tighter exchanges'of experience and harmonization, including: common procedures for selecting 
and engaging communities; optimal cost-sharing techniques; the provision of quality technical 
assistance; mechanisms for effective operation and maintenance; and the measurement and 
evaluation of outcomes. 
Because so many CDD approaches are being carried out in the country -- through 
85. 
LGUs, bypassing LGUs, through a social fund, through a municipal fund, through a line agency, 
through the private sector -- the Philippines provides a unique environment for comparing 
approaches. To this end, a cross sectoral CDD working group was established to exchange 
experiences and a multi-sector supervision of several CDD projects was conducted. Among 
other things, this has resulted in a CDD harmonization exercise in Mindanao with the goal of 
identifying common standards and best practices for conflict affected areas. Going forward, we 
will continue to support and consolidate CDD approaches in close partnership with client 
agencies and other donors. The Spanish government has set a good example in donor 
harmonization for CDD by expanding Kalahi-CIDSS in areas not already covered through a 
Euro I .2 million grant to the DSWD, rather than introduce yet another approach to support the 
poorest communities. 

25 

Government Financial institutions Financing Distinct from grants to LGUs which 

86. 
serve the broader policy goals of the national government, loan financing to LGUs through 
government financial institutions (GFls) would increase based on sound banking principles. 
Bank financing may be on-lent to LGUs through the Land Bank of the Philippines, Development 
Bank of the Philippines, and the newly-created Municipal Finance Corporation, which together 
provide the majority of credit financing to LGUs. Possible Bank operations implemented by the 
GFls include the Local Government Support for City Development (through Land Bank), and the 
Local Government Support for Municipal Finance (through the Municipal Finance Corporation). 
(A list of possible projects is presented in Annex B3). 

87. 
Past experience with lines of credit through GFls indicate problems with low demand 
and slow disbursements. This is attributed to low LGU revenue base; presence of alternative 
financing sources (including political “pork barrel” funds); lack of capacity at LGUs to develop 
“bankable” projects; complicated procedures of funding windows; and the bureaucracies of the 
Bank Group and GFls. New credit lines, therefore, will offer a broad menu of eligible 
subprojects, rather than limit financing to specific sectors. This will empower LGUs to finance 
activities which they deem to be their development priorities. In addition, financing will be 
expedited due to simplified procedures for subproject appraisal, approval, and supervision. 

88. 
Bank financing through GFls would proceed prudently, with particular attention to 
improving GFI service quality.l0 GFls would conduct thorough creditworthiness assessments 
and move toward taking-up real LGU credit risk (currently all GFI loans are fully secured by LGU 
deposits or intercepts of inter-government transfers). For LGUs which meet governance 
performance criteria, consideration may be given to GFI loans financing a share of the LGUs’ 
overall expenditure needs in selected sectors, instead of specific investment projects, thereby 
reducing project-level transactions. The Bank’s local currency loan product will be explored in 
supporting such on-lending arrangements. 

Private Financing 

89. 
In addition to lending to LGUs through GFls, the Bank Group will 
also support the development of the private financial market for LGUs (consistent with the CAS’ 
private sector platform). Private financing to LGUs has been limited. Causes range from lack of 
interest to lack of access to secured collateral (i.e., LGU deposit accounts). The Bank will 
provide policy advice in this area. Through its financial products, IFC will explore ways to 
enhance private financial institutions’ to access to long-term funds that would be retailed directly 
to LGUs for purely commercial projects. In addition, IFC may support the development of 
specialized private firms necessary for the smooth functioning of a municipal bond market. The 
Bank may also use its guarantee instruments to enable GFls to mobilize resources for LGU 
financing via debt issuance in the domestic capital markets. 

Private Sector Platform 

90. 
The private sector platform aims to support successful experiences of private-public 
collaboration that can be replicated and lead to dynamic private-sector led growth. These 
visible successes would include private investment in infrastructure and dynamic private sector 
activity in high growth potential sectors or geographic areas. To help improve the enabling 
environment for such successes and to support the government’s MTPDP reform agenda, the 
Bank Group assistance will focus on: 
lowering the costs of doing business; 

lo Both Land Bank and the Development Bank of the Philippines have recently improved their profitability, 
strengthened their capital base, and mobilized more domestic resources. Moreover, since late 2004, they have 
made efforts to dispose of non-performing assets to private asset management companies. 

26

improving financial intermediation; 
strengthening regulatory agencies; and 
financing public-private infrastructure investments and investments in sectors with high 
growth potential. 

91. 
By creating jobs, generating incomes, and improving infrastructure, the visible 
successes will stimulate political support for the reform agenda, as embodied in the first three 
focus areas outlined above. This symbiotic relationship is illustrated in Figure 11. 

92. 
The private sector platform strategy is designed to complement the national and local 
platforms. In particular, the national platform strategy seeks to help the government establish 
fiscal stability and build the governance structures to address serious macroeconomic, policy, 
and institutional constraints to private investment. For the local platform, private financing is an 
important option for LGUs and the CAS seeks to help develop the performance and capacity of 
LGUs to attract such financing. 

93. 
The strategy envisages a close collaboration between the Bank, IFC, and MIGA. The 
Bank’s analytical and lending support will aim to maximize IFC investment opportunities in 
sectors with high growth potential or where IFC investments can have strong demonstration 
effects (e.g., housing finance, infrastructure, capital markets, small and medium sized 
enterprises). 

Figure 11: 
Private Sector Platform 

Lowering the Cosfs of Doing 

94. 
Business Despite an overall private-sector 
friendly environment, the Philippines is a costly 
place to do business. Our private sector 
platform will focus on helping to bring down 
those transaction costs by improving the 
application of the rule of law. The Bank is 
already providing assistance to reform the 
judiciary”, which could be deepened in order 
to improve the efficiency of judicial processes 
relating to dispute resolution, corporate 
restructuring, and loan recoveries. The Bank 
will also continue to support improvements for 
land management and titling so that security of 
tenure encourages investments.I2 The IFC is 
supporting Land Registration Systems, a 
private entity engaged to provide services for 
the Land Registration Authority on a public- 
private partnership basis. 

95. 
The Bank Group could respond positively to opportunities to help the government 
identify and eliminate constraints to market competition as well as to increase deregulation, 
particularly vital for sectors with high growth potential as well as for growth of small and medium 
enterprises (SMEs). Through SWAps, investment projects, and advisory services -- especially 
in the agriculture, mining, and transport sectors -- the Bank can assist national agencies in the 
simplification and harmonization of procedural regulations and liberalization of rules governing 
private investments. This can be supported by technical assistance programs directed at 

11 
l2

Land Administration and Management Project 2, FY05 

27 

improving the competitiveness of SMEs especially in rural areas. IFC is working on establishing 
with other development partners a program for SMEs based in Mindanao. Through its analytical 
and advisory work, the Bank can help the government establish a competition policy regime and 
reduce the multiplicity of regulations and special investment incentives that give larger firms an 
unfair advantage. 

96. 
lmproving Financial Intermediation The Bank Group could support financial 
deepening by offering technical assistance to key regulatory agencies to improve the prudential 
and supervisory framework for banks, insurance companies, pension funds, the pre-needs 
sector, and capital markets. The Bank Group would also provide financial support to 
intermediaries that serve the needs of micro enterprises, rural households, and SMEs. 

97. 
IFC’s focus in the financial sector is: developing housing finance, deepening the capital 
market, and strengthening the banking sector. IFC is investing in a mortgage servicing 
institution and helping in the restructuring of the National Home Mortgage Finance Corporation. 
IFC’s work on deepening the capital markets also includes technical assistance to the 
Philippines Stock Exchange and support to the Fixed Income Exchange. IFC is looking to 
support the resolution of non-performing loans of the banking sector through asset managed 
companies. IFC is also keen on providing acquisition financing to strong banks to assist in the 
consolidation of the banking sector. For support to LGUs, IFC is considering entering into a 
financial relationship with the LGU Guarantee Corporation to establish a municipal funds market 
as well as providing direct financing to selected municipalities. And, as noted above, IFC is 
considering a program to help develop investment opportunities for SMEs in Mindanao and 
improve their access to financing. Concerning MIGAs role in the financial sector, it can offer 
guarantees by supporting banks whose foreign partners require them to strengthen their capital 
base. Based on demand, MlGA can also offer capital market guarantees in order to increase 
tenors and decrease rates for local lending. 

98. 
Strengthening Regulatory Agencies To increase private investments in 
infrastructure, the private sector platform will support improvements in the governance 
framework of key regulatory agencies. In the water sector, the Bank Group will continue to help 
strengthen the regulatory capacity and independence of the Metropolitan Waterworks and 
Sewerage Systems (MWSS), including the implementation of tariff structures and adjustments 
and cost recovery mechanisms, as well as strengthening enforcement of anti-pollution 
measures. To support the goals of fiscal stability and attracting private investments in the 
power sector, we will assist in enhancing the capacity of the Energy Regulation Committee, the 
privatization of PSALM assets, and the functioning of the Wholesale Electric Spot Market. This 
support will be provided by the Bank through technical assistance and by IFC through its 
advisory services and direct financing for the privatization. To facilitate private investment 
cross-sectorally, and linked to a SWAP for DENR (part of the national platform), the Bank could 
support streamlined environmental permitting and clarification of environmental requirements, 
programs for improved environmental information disclosure, and enhanced environmental 
manage men t systems . 
99. 
I FC 
seeks to invest in infrastructure projects since they reflect urgent and medium-term structural 
constraints to development. IFC is providing advice to the government on attracting private 
sector investment for the Light Rail Project (LRT-1 extension), to the Department of Energy’s 
Small Power Utilities Group for its privatization, and to the Build Operate Transfer Center related 
to projects for bulk water supply for water districts. It also has investments in toll-roads, water, 
and power utilities. In its future program IFC will focus on power, particularly renewable energy, 
rural electrification, and transportation. It is anticipated that IFC operations for the three-year 
CAS period will be about U S 3 5 0 million under a base case scenario. 

Financing lnfrastructure and lnvestments in High Growth Potential Sectors 

28 

100. One investment area in which Bank and IFC collaboration is already noteworthy is the 
Manila Water Company Incorporated (MWCI), the privately-owned water distribution concession 
operating Metro Manila’s eastern zone. Previously, IFC had invested US$60 million in loans 
and US$15 million in equity in MWCI. In addition, the Bank had also invested US$20 million in 
MWCI, through MWSS, for sewerage and sanitation investments. A new FY05 project will 
provide additional financing for capital expenditures in sewerage and sanitation. Without the 
Bank’s support and the more favorable terms of its loans, the sewerage and sanitation 
improvement projects would not have taken place since such investments are generally not 
commercially attractive. These investments are reinforced by the Bank’s ongoing dialogue to 
strengthen MWSS’ regulatory capacity, as noted above. 

101. 
More broadly, the Bank can assist in the development of the government‘s newly-formed 
investment vehicle, the Philippine Infrastructure Corporation, by providing advice on its design 
and financing. Through this new entity, the government intends to incubate, jump-start, and 
later privatize a number of key infrastructure projects such as the South Luzon Expressway. 
Complementing initial assistance by the Bank, the IFC could later provide direct financing to the 
new projects on a commercial basis. 

102. 
The Bank can also provide funding and partial risk guarantees where requested to 
support public infrastructure investments and catalyze private co-financing. This includes a 
possible partial risk guarantee for power sector reform, lending for MWSS financial 
rehabilitation, rural power development, logistics development, toll roads, and other 
infrastructure where the private sector’s interest can be magnified with public support. In 
addition, through innovative approaches such as output-based financing, the Bank’s lending 
would help leverage private sector investment to achieve greater impact. 

103. 
MIGA’s offerings, coordinated with Bank and IFC efforts, would also support public- 
private partnerships for infrastructure development. MIGA’s political risk guarantees can 
complement the Bank and IFC programs, including guarantees for privatizations (acquisitions of 
existing assets, restructuring of existing assets, etc.) in the infrastructure sector. M IGAs 
technical assistance to the Philippines has included a needs assessment of the Bureau of 
Investment, accompanied by capacity building workshops. MlGA has also provided capacity 
building support to sub-national investment promotion agencies in conjunction with a Canadian- 
funded initiative.

111 . Delivering the Bank Group Program 

104. The Bank Group’s FY 2006-08 assistance strategy for the Philippines offers a 
significant and timely opportunity to support the government’s reform efforts by focusing on 
the strengthening of public institutions. 

105. 
Under the platform approach, the Bank Group’s assistance will be opportunistic in 
terms of sectors and areas of engagement, but selective in adjusting the range and level of 
our Bank Group products to respond to the pace of the public reform effort. If fiscal reforms 
should slow, for instance, there would still be considerable scope to provide non-lending 
support and to finance selected projects with strong sectoral reform. We will leverage both 
our financial and non-lending support through coordination with development partners. We 
will also place greater emphasis on managing the portfolio and managing for results. 

Managing the Portfolio 

106. 
The Bank’s ongoing portfolio in the Philippines includes 21 active loans with net 
commitments at US$1.14 billion, along with about 79 grant projects with total value of 
US$46 million and other analytical and advisory activities financed from the Bank’s 
administrative budget. The size of the loan portfolio has declined steadily in recent years, 
from US$2.9 billion in 1999 to US$1 . I 4 billion currently. This has been the result of a 
conscious decision to limit commitments given little fiscal space in the national budget and 
limited absorptive capacity of implementing agencies. More than half of the ongoing 
projects support programs at the local level. 

107. 
Portfolio performance has improved in recent years, but still faces considerable 
challenges. Disbursements declined from 1996 to 2001, but have since improved and are 
currently about 20 percent of undisbursed balances. Older projects with implementation 
problems were restructured and non-performing components and activities were dropped to 
respond to budget constraints. The riskiness of the portfolio has been fairly stable since 
2001, with the number of problem projects remaining steady at three to four and 
commitments at risk now at about 10 percent. The realism and proactivity indices remain 
above Bank targets. Assessments of quality at entry and quality of supervision have 
registered overall satisfactory-and-above ratings. Project outcome ratings have also been 
improving and there has been considerable progress in harmonizing procurement and other 
procedures with those of the government. These changes can be attributed to improved 
portfolio management by both the government and the Bank, with regular joint portfolio 
reviews and increased focus on results. 

108. The existing portfolio is, in many ways, in line with the strategic focus of the new 
CAS and the government’s development priorities, particularly in the areas of increasing 
access to basic services for the poor and disadvantaged groups and in strengthening 
systems and institutions to improve service delivery both at the national and local levels. 
For newly-approved projects the shift towards a programmatic approach is already being 
taken, for example in the FY04 SWAP-type Diversified Farm Income and Market 
Development project. FY05 projects will also incorporate the new CAS emphasis on 
simplified procedures, harmonized rules, and capacity building (e.g., second Women’s 
Health & Safe Motherhood project). A few existing projects, however, may require 
restructuring to improve their implementation and ensure consistency with the new country 
assistance strategy (e.g., LGU Finance and Development project). 

30 

109. 
While portfolio improvements are noteworthy and provide a foundation to build upon, 
there are a number of cross-cutting implementation challenges that limit the program’s 
effectiveness and constrain the achievement of planned outcomes. These challenges 
include: adequacy of budget resources and timely cash releases; improving project 
implementation readiness, including the pace and quality of project preparation and startup; 
strengthening government implementation systems particularly at the local level; and better 
monitoring and evaluation. 

1 10. Going forward, we will continue to undertake joint portfolio reviews with the 
government, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and the Japan Bank for International 
Cooperation (JBIC). Efforts will also continue with the government to improve project 
readiness and to mainstream project activities within implementing agencies. In addition, 
we will strengthen our results-based approach to portfolio monitoring which was piloted 
during the August 2004 project level review conducted jointly with the government. Outputs 
and outcomes of all projects under implementation were summarized using a common 
results framework that helped identify shortfalls in expected achievements and weaknesses 
in project monitoring. A preliminary assessment was also made of results achieved under 
technical assistance provided through grants. This process will be extended to include 
analytical and advisory activities in future project-level reviews. And, of course, the results 
framework developed for this CAS will be the basis for regularly assessing the outputs and 
outcomes of the ongoing portfolio each year. We will use this ongoing monitoring and 
evaluation process to draw lessons to continuously inform all of our program interventions. 

11 1. 
Important steps to improve project implementation are the harmonization of Bank 
procedures with those of the government, which help to strengthen the government‘s 
fiduciary functions. Considerable progress has been made in improving government 
procurement systems and harmonizing the procedures of the Bank, ADB, and JBIC with 
those of the government for national competitive bidding. Focus is now on dissemination 
and monitoring of the new procedures, including requirements for increased transparency 
and the new role of civil society observers. Financial management improvements are also 
becoming harmonized around the effective use of the New Government Accounting System, 
which is being adopted consistently across all levels of government. The Bank is also 
leading the Development Partners Working Group on Decentralization and Local 
Government to promote consistency in the LGU engagement strategy. 

11 2. The government has welcomed the Bank’s new approach to expenditure eligibility, 
reflected in the new country financing parameters approved in February 2005. This 
provides for increased flexibility in the treatment of cost sharing, taxes, recurrent costs, and 
local costs. (See Annex 3) The Bank’s overall financing share is not expected to change 
significantly at the aggregate level, with expected increase in sector-wide assistance (in 
which the Bank’s financing share is typically low). One-hundred percent Bank financing 
could be provided for some projects and activities with strong evidence of ownership and 
commitment. Recurrent cost financing will be considered where consistent with project 
objectives, subject to strong demonstration of arrangements to ensure sustainability after 
Bank financing ceases. Integration of Bank financing in the budget process ensures that 
increased recurrent cost financing would not jeopardize overall debt and fiscal sustainability. 

113. The Bank is working with the government to strengthen capacity to implement and 
monitor procedures to safeguard important social and environment policies. In particular, 
procedures related to land acquisition, the rights of indigenous people, and resettlement 

31 

have been identified as problem areas. Joint discussions have led to preparation of a draft 
law to address some of the land and resettlement issues. Similarly, while many government 
policies and procedures on the environment are appropriate, their implementation faces a 
number of challenges, including streamlining the DENR and prioritizing monitoring efforts 
within limited budgets. There is also a need to strengthen environmental management 
capacity at the local government level. 

114. 
In line with the Bank’s effort to gradually move to greater reliance on country 
systems, the Bank is also undertaking a diagnostic review to help the government identify 
social and environmental policy and institutional needs based on gaps between the 
Philippines’ and international good practices. The review will also identify concrete actions 
that can be taken in the areas of environmental assessment, involuntary resettlement, and 
institutional capacity. The longer-term goal -- supported by the platform approach -- is to 
help build capacity for planning, implementing, and supervising social and environment 
safeguards. In line with our local platform, discussions have begun among the various 
development partners on harmonizing procedures related to these safeguards, with 
consistent approaches designed to enhance local government capacity. Further efforts on 
harmonization in the social and environmental areas will be carried out as part of portfolio 
management during the CAS period, and will pave the way for greater reliance on country 
systems in these areas. 

1 15. The Bank Group is actively supporting government anti-corruption efforts with the 
Office of the Ombudsman, Presidential Anti-Graft Commission, Supreme Court, Government 
Procurement Policy Board, and civil society organizations. At the project level, the Bank 
Group has supported improved fiduciary procedures in health, education, and social welfare, 
including large reduction in textbook costs and civil society monitoring of book deliveries. 
Innovative contracting approaches, for example in roads and solid waste disposal, allow 
payment on performance rather than inputs. Fiduciary reviews check procurement and 
financial management processes, and growing use of community-driven development 
provides greater local involvement in planning and monitoring local expenditures. 

Lending 

116. The new assistance strategy proposes a graduated response to policy scenarios for 
the Bank Group to achieve systemic impact. Our financing is moving towards more 
mainstreamed support for the government’s own programs. Significantly, it will not create a 
substantial additional fiscal burden on the government. Moreover, the government has 
indicated its preference to rely more on official development assistance (ODA) over 
commercial borrowing, because of its potential to promote key reforms and lower costs. 
Finally, the new assistance strategy will offer flexibility to respond quickly to opportunities 
and scale-up lending if warranted. (See Table 12) 

1 17. 
The scale of IBRD commitments will be determined by progress on fiscal reforms 
reflecting the overarching importance of fiscal adjustment in the short term and the need to 
mitigate and manage risks. Assuming a scenario of gradual policy reform, the Bank’s base 
case program would fall within a range U S 4 5 0 - 900 million of investment lending only, for 
the three-year CAS period. This level is less than the base case scenarios of about US$1 .I 
- 1.3 billion for the two previous CAS periods, but more than the actual level of lending over 

32 

the previous  period^.'^ Lower than anticipated lending levels were due to fiscal constraints 
for regular investment operations and limited progress on fiscal reforms that held back 
development policy lending.14 

1 18. The base case represents a scenario in which there are no major policy reversals 
and no widening of the fiscal deficit, but progress on implementing key reforms is uneven. 
Under this scenario, Bank lending of up to US$900 million would not include development 
policy lending (DPL). The actual amount would be driven by country demand and would 
depend on the number of agencies and LGUs willing and able to take on reforms. At the 
national level, this would imply the continuation of efforts to: reduce the public sector deficit, 
strengthen public expenditure management, service delivery, and tax administration. For 
Bank financial support at the sub-national level, greater clarity in the financing framework 
would be expected. At both levels, lending would also be linked to the national government 
and LGUs’ ability to prepare high quality operations in a timely manner. Good performance 
of the existing portfolio would also need to be maintained to increase lending within the base 
case, If progress on reforms and capacity is weak and if the portfolio deteriorates, Bank 
lending would fall commensurately. 

119. 
In a high case, the Bank would be prepared to provide total lending, including 
development policy lending, of up to US$? .8 billion in response to an accelerated reform 
scenario. Entry into the high case could occur once a track record of policies and 
associated outcomes have been established, with a reduction of the consolidated public 
sector deficit (CPSD) of 2 percent of GDP relative to 2004, as part of a sustained adjustment 
effort compatible with a deficit reduction of 3 percent of GDP during 2005-07.’5 A significant 
portion of the fiscal adjustment would be expected to derive from increases in the tax 
revenue to GDP ratio, reflecting progress on both tax administration and tax policy 
improvements. This fiscal adjustment would likely generate improvements in financial 
market indicators and a significant reduction in the cost of borrowing. With improving 
confidence in the macroeconomic policy framework, the share of private investment in the 
economy would also grow. Lower public deficits and growth from stronger financial markets 
and higher investments would combine to significantly reduce public debt/GDP. Substantial 
progress toward the high case would be considered in an enhanced base case, 
characterized by steady progress in strengthening public sector revenues and reducing the 
public sector deficit (see footnote in Table 12). 

120. 
In addition to fiscal adjustment, development policy lending, whether in a high case 
or an enhanced base case, would support structural reforms in areas such as tax policy and 
administration, public expenditure management including civil service reform, banking and 
pension systems, the power sector, investment climate and capital markets, among other 
possibilities. The pace and quality of the reforms implemented would influence the size and 
timing of DPL. Each of a series of annual DPLs could cover fiscal reforms plus other key 
reforms from the list above. 

121. A low case scenario would be characterized by inadequate fiscal adjustment 
contributing to heightened concerns regarding fiscal and debt sustainability, limited progress

l5 

The actual lending was US$472 million for the FY2000-02 CAS period and US$379 million (projected) for 
the FY2003-05 CAS period. 
Development policy lending was included in the base case in the FY2003-05 CAS but was not actually 
committed. 
The CPSD in 2004 is reported at 5.0 percent of GDP. Adjustments to the CPSD would be measured net of 
privatization receipts. 

33 

in other key policy areas, and deterioration in the quality of the Bank’s portfolio. Under such 
circumstances, Bank lending would fall below US$450 million and lending instruments would 
focus more narrowly on a selected number of investment projects to support direct poverty 
reduction and delivery of critical public services (e.g., National Program Support for Health, 
Basic Education, Social Protection, and Kalahi 2 (CDD) projects).

a/ An enhanced base case would also be considered. In this case, DPL up to U S 4 5 0 million could be 
included, with the proviso that total Bank lending would not rise above US$1.2 billion. Entry into the 
enhanced base case could occur once a track record of policies and associated outcomes have been 
established, with a reduction of the CPSD of about 1 .O - 1.25 percent of GDP relative to 2004, as part of a 
sustained adjustment effort compatible with a deficit reduction of 2 percent of GDP during 2005-07. A 
significant portion of the fiscal adjustment would again be expected to derive from increases in the tax 
revenue to GDP ratio. 

122. 
To allow for flexibility to respond to emerging needs, a menu of potential projects and 
estimated lending amounts, aligned to the platforms, has been prepared. (See Annex 83) 
This indicative list of possible projects will be updated periodically. Some projects would 
drop out depending upon evolving needs, and new projects may be added that are 
consistent with the CAS framework. 

123. Bank exposure to the Philippines is estimated at US$3.3 billion at the end of fiscal 
year 2005, versus a peak of US$5.5 billion in FY95, reflecting negative net disbursements 
from the Bank in each of the past ten years. Negative net transfers (including interest 
payments) averaged nearly U S 4 0 0 million per annum in the past decade. Consequently, 
exposure ratios fall well within Bank guidelines and debt to the Bank accounts for about 5 
percent of the country’s external debt. Given projected principal repayments during 
FY2006-08 averaging about US$400 million per annum, Bank exposure would continue to 
decline during the next three years under the base case. Indeed, even with an enhanced 

34 

base case (up to US$1.2 billion), exposure would not increase. Exposure would only 
increase with an aggressive expansion in development policy lending predicated by an 
improved policy environment under the high lending case. The number of investment loans 
that could be relatively faster disbursing (SWAp operations, for example, typically disburse 
over a fewer number of years than do other investment operations) would be limited to 
remain within these broad categories of exposure. 

124. For IFC, the Philippines is among the Corporation’s top ten country exposures with a 
committed portfolio of U S 4 3 0 million in 31 projects mainly in the infrastructure and financial 
sectors. (See Annex 88) MIGA’s current exposure in the Philippines stands at US$103 
million of gross exposure in the infrastructure and finance sectors. (See Annex 88) This is 
well below the country limit ( U S 4 2 0 million net), giving significant room for additional 
guarantees. 

Providing Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA) and Sharing Knowledge 

125. 
In the Philippines there has been remarkable receptivity for the Bank Group’s 
analytical and advisory activities (AAA), drawn from its global knowledge and international 
experience. These activities are particularly important for achieving impact, in view of 
possibly limited lending volumes. The Bank Group will continue to invest in high-quality, 
demand-driven AAA. This work will encompass: economic & sector work, which will 
underpin our policy dialogue with the client as well as provide the foundation for effective 
lending; and technical assistance which can be flexibly used to help the client implement 
reforms. 

126. 
Given the premium placed in this CAS on seizing opportunities when they arise and 
being able to adjust to the evolving client priorities, a definitive list of new AAA tasks is not 
provided as it will evolve over the CAS period. AAA will focus on several important broad 
areas in which an ongoing dialogue will take place, in particular: 
Fiscal reforms: AAA will build on recently completed work such as the Development 
Policy Review. Our policy dialogue will focus on the direction of tax policy as the 
main vehicle for managing macroeconomic stability and achieving sustainable 
growth. This could also involve debt sustainability analysis and assessment of the 
impact of fiscal stimulus on growth and poverty reduction. To complement such 
fiscal analysis, AAA could also be conducted on contingent liabilities and pension 
reform. The medium to long-term AAA agenda could include technical assistance to 
improve the quality, effectiveness, and efficiency of public institutions, processes, 
and systems (e.g., medium-term budget plans, budget systems, monitoring, 
oversight, and possibly the formulation of a fiscal responsibility act). 
Growth and the investment climate: AAA will support the development of policies to 
enhance productivity and competitiveness. Work will aim to improve the 
development of new policy approaches and to build capacity that will help the 
Philippines derive greater domestic productivity growth benefits from reforms. This 
could include analysis on improving supply chain logistics, the regulatory framework 
for private investment, and related financial sector issues. In addition to national 
issues on growth and competitiveness, AAA could help identify targeted measures to 
support productivity improvements and employment among the rural poor and to 
strengthen alliances between public and private stakeholders at regional and local 

0 

35 

0 

levels. This could include support for better agricultural trade policy and 
infrastructure development. 
Social development and inclusion, social protection, and poverty: The AAA program 
will encompass advice on how to improve the coverage and quality of basic social 
services and social assistance and how to reduce vulnerabilities (e.g., mitigate the 
impact of shocks on the poor). The work will build on updated poverty analysis using 
the recently completed national poverty map to improve budget allocations. This 
could involve assistance to design a social protection framework, including a strategy 
to scale-up effective programs, achieve synergies between social services, and 
empower the poor. Other AAA activities could include developing different poverty 
targeting mechanisms and interventions to support more objective, equitable, and 
less political allocation of resources. These activities would be closely linked to work 
on fiscal and decentralization issues. Additional AAA work may include policy notes 
on human resource reform in the health sector, building knowledge on public-private 
partnerships in the social sector, as well as developing a deeper understanding of 
regional poverty by continuing work on poverty mapping. 
Governance, political economy ofreform, and anti-corruption: AAA work in this area 
will focus on developing rigorous stakeholder models to analyze the impact of policy 
reform proposals on different stakeholder groups and improve the understanding of 
the political economy of reform in the Philippines. Building on ongoing work with the 
judiciary and other oversight agencies, support is likely to focus on increasing 
transparency and accountability within government agencies and within private 
corporations, strengthening institutions of government, and increasing involvement of 
civil society and elected officials in the oversight of government activities. Specific 
areas of attention could be on improvements in financial management practices, 
public administration management, and judicial effectiveness. 
LGUs, municipal finance, and fiscal decentralization: Potential AAA for this topic 
would focus on three areas: rationalizing the existing inter-governmental transfer 
system; introducing a performance orientation to it; and improving the ability of local 
governments to enter into sustainable public-private partnerships which support 
growth and employment. 
Meeting infrastructure needs: Building on the Meeting lnfrastructure Needs report 
(to be completed by end-FY2005), forthcoming AAA will address specific 
infrastructure reform topics that are of particular interest to the government, such as 
the power and water sectors and preparing policy notes on wastewater and solid 
waste management issues. In addition, advice could be offered to the Philippines 
lnfrastructure Corporation and the BOT Center on logistics development. 

127. 
Another important aspect of our AAA program will be to discuss, disseminate, and 
draw on several ongoing multi-year initiatives. In particular, the policy recommendations of 
the Meeting lnfrastructure Needs report will be discussed extensively with the government, 
and will provide the groundwork for future lending as part of both the national and local 
platforms. Similarly, the Investment Climate Assessment, once published, will aim to inform 
a broad range of stakeholders about critical private investment related issues, and thereby 
promote agreement on the reform agenda. 

128. Trust funds will continue to play a prominent role in our entire program. Besides 
support to specific lending operations or recipients’ programs, trust funds allow us to 
undertake a range of AAA that would be difficult to finance otherwise, in such areas as 

36 

poverty monitoring and analysis; governance and anti-corruption; corporate social 
responsibility in the mining sector; strengthening LGU accountability; and managing water 
resources. In addition, a multi-partner trust fund that supports reconstruction and 
development efforts in Mindanao is being established, to be administered by the Bank. (See 
Box 2) 

129. 
Overall, we will also put greater emphasis on just-in-time AAA, to respond to 
immediate client needs. Through the use of videoconferences, written materials, and 
dialogue, the Bank Group can offer its clients quick advice on a range of topics, based on 
our in-house experts, global knowledge network, and technology systems. A prime example 
of this was a videoconference held in late-2004 which gave four government secretaries a 
chance to discuss social protection policies and options, with a panel of Bank Group experts 
who had wide-ranging global experience. 

130. 
Knowledge sharing of our AAA is an integral business line of the Bank Group. We 
intend to package our research and international experience with local knowledge and 
innovatively disseminate it to achieve maximum impact on target stakeholders. To support 
the government’s reform program, the Bank Group could promote Knowledge for 
Development Networks at the national and local levels. These would be co-organized and 
mobilized in partnership with government and civil society institutions, and associations that 
support knowledge sharing and networking through communities of practice. The networks 
could serve as channels for information dissemination, advocacy of policy agenda, and 
promoting islands of good governance and replication of best practices. 

131. 
Distancele-learning will be part of our knowledge sharing strategy. Through our 
partnership with Asian Institute of Management and the Bank Group’s network of 
Knowledge for Development Centers (KDCs), virtual courses will be offered on project and 
procurement management and disaster risk management for national and local agencies. 
(See Box 5) Such activities will be supported by the WBI and the Bank Group’s Global 
Distance Learning Network. In addition, we will continue to co-organize with Asian Institute 
of Management, the KDCs, and other national and international partners, real-time fora and 
policy dialogue on relevant development themes. 

132. As one of its focus countries, WBl’s program for the Philippines will be closely 
aligned to the new CAS. A multi-year program of customized WBI activities will be linked to 
AAA, as well as to operational work. The National Disaster Coordinating Council, in 
partnership with WBI and three Philippine KDC universities, launched in 2005 an online 
course on disaster risk management. The course was the first of its kind in the Philippines 
as well as for the Bank Group at the country level and in collaboration with local country 
partners. A broader program of capacity building targeted to strengthen the core 
competencies of LGUs is also being developed. Topics will include strategy formulation and 
development planning process; budgeting, financial management, and creditworthiness; and 
revenue mobilization. In addition, Philippine government officials will participate in a WBI- 
sponsored course to build capacity to combat money laundering and terrorism financing. 

Partnering to Achieve Greater Impact 

133. 
A network of strong partnerships is critical to knowledge sharing, and to delivering 
our lending and AAA programs. Over the past decade the Bank Group has had a proactive 
outreach program in the Philippines. We have established robust partnerships not only with 
our main client, government, but with a range of stakeholders such as international 

37 

development partners, civil society, the business sector, academia, and the media. We will 
sustain and build on our long-established relationships and actively explore new ones. 

134. The Bank Group’s partnership with ADB and JBIC is especially critical. ADB, in 
particular, is facing similar program challenges as the Bank Group and it is responding by 
also adjusting its engagement strategy. With its strategic focus on fiscal consolidation, 
improved investment climate, and support for faster achievement of the MDGs, there is 
strong complementarity between ADB’s 2005-2006 Country Strategy and Program and the 
Bank Group’s new CAS. Looking ahead there is scope for closer collaboration and 
synchronized efforts in several areas including assessment of and support for the 
government’s fiscal program, planning processes, governance and anti-corruption agenda, 
and decentralization and LGU engagement strategy, and the results framework. Together, 
ADB, JBIC, and the Bank Group programs comprise approximately 90 percent of the 
country’s total ODA resources. With the government, the three institutions will continue 
harmonization efforts. In addition, we will continue to coordinate closely with the IMF, 
particularly in the areas of fiscal and banking, and the assessment of macroeconomic 
policies. We will also continue our collaboration with the United Nations country team on 
addressing the MDGs and other common activities. 

135. 
At the project and sectoral level, partnerships will continue to be pursued. SWAp- 
type operations, in particular, offer excellent opportunities for coordination with development 
partners where there is a common agenda with the government and strong commitment 
from the line agency. A good example is our ongoing coordination with the European 
Commission and ADB during the preparation of the National Program Support for Health 
project (FY06) given their active support of the government’s agenda in this area. Overall, 
we will seek to develop a more harmonized, less fragmented framework for assistance 
among partner programs, especially for local governments. We especially intend to create 
better synergies with bilateral agencies, which have a range of programs targeted to the 
local level. Extensive coordination with both bilateral and multilateral development agencies 
on the creation of the Mindanao Trust Fund is a good example of how the Bank Group will 
leverage its programs with development partners. 

136. 
Global partnerships on the environment are an emerging and important business line 
for the Philippines program. One of the region’s first agreements under the global Carbon 
Fund Emission Reductions Purchase Program was recently signed for the Philippines. As 
the first wind farm in the Philippines, the project will have a significant demonstration effect 
in accelerating the commercialization of wind power in the country, consistent with the CAS 
private sector platform. The Multilateral Fund for the Montreal Protocol is also supporting a 
number of on-going projects in the Philippines to reduce ozone-depleting substances. In 
addition, the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) is supporting global research for Coral 
Reef Management which has significant focus on the Philippines. Going forward and in line 
with the programmatic approach of this CAS, the GEF will also support a cross-sectoral and 
integrated environment and natural resources management project. 

38 

rom academia 

government sector use th 
tatives are the main KDC 

137. We will also enhance our strategic coordination with other external partnership 
programs such as the Water and Sanitation Program, which supports capacity building and 
knowledge sharing. The Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) will be 
counted on to provide continued support to the Philippines to strengthen the investment 
environment for infrastructure. 

138. The Cities Alliance will also continue to support City Development Strategies and 
other urban development assistance especially with the reported successes of the early 
CDS program. This program has planted the seed for implementing and institutionalizing 
participatory urban governance processes in urban development decision making (e.g., 

39 

economic development planning, addressing poverty issues, project prioritization and capital 
investment planning). Instead of the originally planned strategies for ten cities, the program 
has generated city development strategies in 31 new cities due to a strong response from 
city mayors. These will be further supported through the Local Government Support for 
Cities Development (FY06). The approach will deepen the Bank Group’s assistance and 
policy dialogue under the local platform of this CAS. 

139. 
In playing an honest-broker role, our dialogue with civil society leaders and opinion 
makers will be vital, especially in expanding relationships with congressional leaders. We 
will support the government’s efforts to build coalitions for reform and help promote public 
discussion and healthy debate, particularly related to the CAS themes of governance and 
fiscal stability. 

140. The Panibagong Paraan (“New Ways”) Development Marketplace program will also 
serve as a venue for building partnerships with and between the branches of government, 
development partners, civil society, and the private sector. This event, programmed every 
18 to 24 months, promotes innovative ideas in poverty reduction and encourages the 
replication and scaling-up of successful projects. 

141. 
The Bank will continue its coordinating role among external development partners 
through our organization and co-chairing, under the government’s leadership, of the 
Consultative Group (CG) meetings. Under the CG umbrella, activities of other development 
partners are already in line with the four CAS themes and are being coordinated through 
various existing and new working groups. For instance, CG working groups on the MDGs, 
health sector reforms, and education reforms are underway and support multi-agency 
dialogue and coordination in the social sector, including social inclusion issues. New CG 
working groups on decentralization and local governments, governance and anti-corruption, 
economic and fiscal reforms, and growth and investment climate, are expected to continue 
beyond the formal CG meetings, and will undoubtedly further the CAS’ goals in each of 
these areas. 

142. 
In March 2005, for the first time the CG meeting involved a broad range of 
stakeholders from civil society, Congress, the business community, academia, as well as 
government and development partner representatives, and to reflect its changed approach 
was renamed the Philippines Development Forum. The interactive discussion provided an 
opportunity for all groups to develop a better understanding and perspective on the reform 
agenda, and hence fostered consensus. This Forum will continue and will focus on key 
development issues and encompass broader participation and deeper development 
dialogue. 

Managing Risks 

143. 
This entire CAS is focused on support for the Philippines to grasp opportunities and 
manage substantial risks. A serious risk would be fading political support for key reforms. 
The CAS is driven by the desire to minimize this risk by urging front-loaded reforms and 
helping the country accelerate the benefits that are expected from fiscal and other reforms. 

144. 
More specifically, the Bank Group’s program over the next three years will face risks 
related to its effectiveness and ability to attain outcomes. The Bank Group’s effectiveness 
will depend, to a large degree, on the extent of political will for reform and the pace of 
change. In particular, failure to rein in fiscal deficits would create greater economic 

40 

vulnerability and require further expenditure contraction. This would negatively impact the 
Bank portfolio and investment lending. Possible external shocks could also weaken the 
economy with the same impact. 

145. Social and political events can pose unpredictable, yet serious risks to our program 
and to overall development outcomes. Significant constitutional reforms are contemplated 
and could change the political landscape significantly and in ways that are difficult to predict 
at this time. 

146. 
The failure to achieve a sustained peace arrangement in Mindanao poses one 
particular risk. Without a peace agreement between the government and the MILF, the 
Mindanao Trust Fund for reconstruction and development (for which the Bank Group is 
playing an active role in coordinating among development partners) would be limited to 
modest capacity-building activities. Security concerns in Mindanao and elsewhere could 
also hamper private investment and the preparation and supervision of Bank-financed 
projects. To mitigate the possible impact of such risks on the Bank Group’s program, we will 
maintain our broad and deep partnerships with development partners and country 
stakeholders. While this can help reduce the impact on our program, such risks may 
nonetheless have serious implications for the country itself. 

147. Overall, the CAS is designed to not only capture opportunities for reform, but also to 
mitigate and manage the risks to the Bank Group’s finances and reputation. This is 
achieved through a strategy that scales Bank lending to the Philippines’ progress on policy 
reforms and implementation, as outlined above. The platform approach itself is fundamental 
to risk management since it strives to improve effectiveness of public institutions and the 
ability to sustain reform measures. 

148. Risks will also be reduced as we rely more actively on the results framework as a 
management tool. As noted, monitoring and evaluation of CAS outcomes will be integral to 
our annual programming and portfolio reviews. This will allow us to identify potential 
problems early on. And, the SWAP lending approach provides enough flexibility to adjust 
lending levels quickly depending upon the circumstances. 

149. Our strong relationship with multiple stakeholders within the country as well as with 
external development partners is another important way for the Bank Group to minimize its 
risks and ensure its effectiveness under changing country circumstances. 

Managing for Res u Its 

150. 
The CAS results framework (Annex B9) will be used to manage the assistance 
program on an ongoing basis. It identifies result targets at three levels: 
Country development goals, extracted from the 2004-10 MTPDP, and some of the 
more challenging MDGs for the Philippines. (See Box 1) These are shown in the far 
left-hand column in Annex B9, and represent the country’s development objectives to 
which the Bank Group can contribute but for which we do not control the outcome. 
They provide the medium-term context for monitoring of the Bank Group’s 
assistance. 
CAS outcomes, expressed as “top-down” measures of visible successes that can 
be replicated and thus achieve greater impact. These are based on the four CAS 
themes (e.g., governance) and the three implementation platforms (e.g., national 

0 

41 

platform) and are noted in the center column of the results framework. These CAS 
outcomes (summarized by theme and platform in Table 13) link program-level 
milestones to country development goals. The results outlined seek to identify 
higher-level changes leveraged by Bank assistance. These are intentionally less 
project-specific than in traditional CAS approaches (e.g., number of roads built, 
drinking water systems established, etc.). This is to ensure relevance and impact of 
Bank assistance in a middle-income country where the Bank’s financial resources 
account for a very small share (recently about 0.2 percent of GDP). 
Program-level milestones, or a “bottoms-up” approach, reflecting the outcomes of 
the Bank Group assistance program of loans and AAA, including the existing 
portfolio. These are summarized in the fourth column in Annex B9. The indicators 
here are at a more aggregate level than the indicators provided from individual 
projects, allowing for broader assessment of the overall impact of current and 
proposed Bank Group activities. Annex Table B10 provides more detail by mapping 
the ongoing and new lending and non-lending activities (including relevant programs 
of partners) against the CAS themes and platforms. 

151. Taking account of past experience, the targets for program-level milestones of the 
Bank Group program are modest and selective, providing a broad framework for assistance 
without over-promising on outcomes or over-prescribing the approach which may be 
adopted to achieve these goals. In some cases, the identified targets are new and further 
work will be required to identify baselines and measurement techniques. The approach to 
finalizing these will be documented as part of the forthcoming portfolio review. We will 
explore with the government the possibilities for sharing these reviews with external 
stakeholders, so that CAS consultation can become a more continuous process. 

152. The government is also working on results-based management of its expenditure 
programs. With assistance from the Bank, the government has identified Major Final 
Outputs for each of 13 national government agencies, highlighting key results associated 
with their core functional mandates and key indicators for their achievement. These will be 
used during 2005 to review and improve targeting of budget allocations for 2006. At this 
stage the indicators being developed for this purpose are not necessarily good indicators of 
achievement of Bank assistance targets. We plan to monitor and compare both approaches 
and expect the CAS results monitoring process to gradually converge with government‘s 
performance management indicators. 

153. 
A potential list of projects has been developed and will help in formulating annual 
work programs as needs evolve. (See Annex B3) While these goals provide clear targets, 
the framework is intended to be sufficiently flexible to respond to evolving priorities over the 
CAS period. Hence, projects and programs may change. 

154. 
This a three-year CAS covering fiscal years 2006-08. The decision was made to 
cover a three-year period, instead of the now more common four-year Bank Group 
strategies, to align better with the government’s six-year electoral cycle and six-year period 
for the MTPDP, both which commenced in mid-2004. This timeframe, therefore, will allow 
the next three-year CAS to assess the Bank Group’s impact in tandem with the current 
administration’s mid-term review of its MTPDP, and to respond accordingly. In addition, the 
Bank Group will undertake a focused progress report about half-way into the CAS period to 
ensure that the strategy continues to be relevant and the implementation is broadly on track. 

4 2 

Table 13: 
CAS-Level Goals 

Organizing Ourselves to Deliver 

155. 
To deliver the CAS, the Bank activities will be organized in clusters based around 
key client relationships. These are also more closely aligned with the result areas described 
earlier, allowing more clear accountability for results and promoting greater room for 
prioritization of efforts within the platform teams. This implies a significant shift away from 
the management of individual (sometimes fragmented) tasks toward the management of 
client relationships and related clusters of work. 

43 

156. 
At the national level, the work program will be organized into clusters aligned with 
key client institutions, such as the line departments responsible for rural development, 
environment, health, and education. The CAS' national platform will provide a coordinated 
approach for cross-cutting support of government efforts to improve public sector 
performance, efficiency, governance, and service delivery. Key analytic work on sector- 
specific and cross-sectoral issues will also be included in these clusters. 

157. Activities at the local level will be clustered to ensure consistent and effective 
assistance to local institutions. Tt7e CAS' local platform will provide a common framework 
for local performance assessment, capacity building, implementing procedures, financing, 
and community-driven development. This cluster will include loans and technical assistance 
provided directly to local governments and institutions in support of local development plans. 
Since some national programs also include support for priority programs implemented at the 
local level, the local platform will need a strong cross-sectoral approach to ensure 
compatibility between national assistance and local financing, needs, and capacity. The 
local platform will also work with government on identifying options for rationalizing national 
grant programs to improve performance incentives and targeting of national priorities. WBI 
assistance is also expected to be targeted on local performance and capacity building 
efforts. 

158. 
The private sector platform will include work clusters dealing with the key 
infrastructure areas (power, water, transport), IFC investments, financial sector, and other 
Bank Group efforts to improve the investment climate and support increased private 
investments in the Philippines. We envisage increased coordination between Bank and IFC 
teams, and increased attention to support government efforts for private participation in 
infrastructure. 

159. Each work cluster is expected to include a number of tasks grouped under a team 
with clear accountability for client relationships. The CAS results framework also identifies 
clear result areas for each platform. The country team will ensure smooth coordination of 
work program clusters with the Bank's sector teams and other Bank Group units contributing 
to the assistance strategy.

Page 1 of 13 

1. 
The objective of the Philippines Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) Completion Report 
is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Bank’s assistance program to the Philippines and draw 
lessons for preparation of a new assistance strategy for the FYO6-08 period. While the focus is 
on the most recent CAS which covers FYO3-05, the review also looked at the 2000-2004 period 
to take a medium-term view of the program. This CAS Completion Report: 
reviewed the Bank’s previous CAS’ to determine the Bank’s strategic objectives and 
their link to government goals in the Medium-Term Philippines Development Plan 
(MTPDP); 
reviewed portfolio performance and selected Bank documents and assessments carried 
out to date; 
interviewed Bank staff and managers (both in Washington and Manila), government 
counterparts, and selected individuals outside the government who are knowledgeable 
of Bank operations*; 
assessed to what extent the Bank was successful in meeting CAS objectives; and 
drew lessons for future Bank assistance.

2. 
The report draws heavily on the work done to date in Manila on assessing the results of 
the Bank’s portfolio and the technical assistance program. This work is being conducted as part 
of the move towards results based management of the portfolio with the government. 

II. Government’s Strategic Goals 

3. 
The government’s strategic objectives for the CAS period are presented in the MTPDP 
(2001-04). The plan consisted of four key strategic areas: 
macroeconomic stability with equitable growth based on free enterprise; 
agriculture and fisheries modernization with social equity; 
comprehensive human development and protecting the vulnerable; and 
good governance and the rule of law.

4. 
The plan laid out a comprehensive and ambitious agenda3. Among others, it aimed to: 
promote macroeconomic stability; generate employment; enhance competitiveness of industry 
and services; accelerate infrastructure development; modernize agriculture and fisheries; further

Poor through Growth and Empowerment., April 30, 2002; The Philippines Country Assistance Strategy, May 11,

A total of 43 people were interviewed: 23 Bank staff, 14 senior government officials (primarily at the 
undersecretary, and assistant secretary level); 3 senior officials of government corporations (including the 
Development Bank of the Philippines; and 3 people outside the government.

agrarian reform; promote sustainable use of natural resources; strengthen education and 
training; enhance health care; expand access to shelter; protect vulnerable groups; pursue 
balanced regional development; secure peace in Mindanao; improve law enforcement and 
administration of justice; and promote good governance. 

111. Bank Strategic Objectives and CAS Outcomes 

5. 
The Bank’s FYO3-05 CAS was also broad and aligned with the government‘s strategy. 
The Bank’s strategy was defined in terms of two broad objectives: to help achieve more rapid 
sustained growth, and support national efforts to empower the poor to increase their 
participation in development. To facilitate effective partnership with government, the Bank 
aligned its strategy with the four-part framework of the MTPDP, and the CAS described in detail 
how the Bank program supported the MTPDP4. The CAS was presented to and endorsed by 
the President and the Cabinet. This formality confirmed government ownership and allowed the 
Bank to stand by the lending scenarios laid out in the CAS. 

6. 
The CAS’S comprehensiveness reflects the breadth of the MTPDP and the scope of the 
Bank’s engagement in the Philippines. The FYO3-05 CAS presented an overview of the Bank’s 
program, but it did not include a concise statement of strategic objectives nor provide sufficient 
basis to assess whether the Bank was successful in meeting its objectives. The main text of the 
CAS (Table 3-1) listed 22 objectives subdivided by the two CAS objectives and the four MTPDP 
themes, but it did not articulate what outcomes the Bank was attempting to achieve. The CAS 
Program Matrix (Annex B9) outlined 38 strategic objectives (which were in line with, but not 
necessarily identical to, the 22 in the main text), presented country and Bank performance 
indicators, and specified Bank instruments for each objective by the four MTPDP themes. While 
the Program Matrix was designed to be an experimental results framework at that time, it did not 
fully develop a picture of what the Bank was hoping to achieve by the end of the CAS period. 
This was because: (i) it did not help establish priorities; (ii) base lines were generally not given 
for performance indicators; and (iii) targets were set mostly as directions (“increase”/”decrease”) 
with no specific outcome against which to measure progress. Public finance was an exception 
in which the Bank set clear targets for increase in tax revenues and decrease in national 
government deficit, using it as a trigger for adjustment lending in the Base Case scenario5. The 
Program Matrix was not kept up-to-date nor apparently used during program implementation’. 

IV. Results Assessment 

7. 
The following sections summarize country progress and Bank actions by Bank strategic 
objective. A simple assessment is made on the Bank’s success in meeting its objectives. 
These objectives were derived by summarizing the stated strategic objectives in the main text 
and the Program Matrix. They are clustered along the four strategic themes in the FYO3-05 

The contribution of the Bank’s assistance program to the four strategic areas of MTPDP are described in detail in 
pages 35-44 of the FYO3-05 CAS. 
The Base Case triggers included improvements in fiscal performance: taxlGNP ratio to increase by 0.4 percent 
per year in 2002-2005; national government deficitlGNP ratio to decline by 0.5 percent per year through 2005. 
Having a limited number of strategic objectives, baselines, and targets does not ensure that they would be used. 
The FYOO-02 CAS included seven strategic objectives and a similar program matrix (Annex B9), outlining 
strategic objectives and performance indicators. The matrix did include some performance measures with base 
lines and targets, but was comprehensive, covering 18 pages. The FYO3-05 CAS did not refer to these 
indicators in its review of previous experience and it does not appear that this matrix was used for Bank program 
management. 

Annex 1

CAS. A detailed discussion of the objectives and country and Bank performance is included in 
Attachment 1. 

A. Macroeconomic Stability and Equitable Growth Based on Free Enterprise 

Strengthen fiscal policy by improving tax effort and containing contingent 

8. 
liabilities: The government's fiscal situation continued to worsen with the ratio of national 
government fiscal deficit to GDP increasing from 4.0 percent in 2000 and to 4.6 percent in 2003 
and non-financial public debt increasing from 88 percent of GDP in 2000 to about 101 percent in 
2003. The government's inability to increase revenues is a key factor in this decline. While the 
government was able to control budget expenditures, with expenditures remaining around 19 
percent of GDP, tax revenue to GDP dropped from 13.7 percent in 2000 to 12.5 percent in 2003. 
The government is taking measures to strengthen tax administration, but a key constraint has 
been the unwillingness of the legislature to enact policy measures needed to increase revenues, 
especially tax increases. Similarly, regulators had not approved revision to power and water 
tariffs, a key factor for the deficits in Government Owned and Controlled Corporations (GOCCs). 
Following the election in May 2004, the government is beginning to turn the deficit situation 
around with the CY2004 deficit below target, substantial progress being made on three tax bills, 
and power tariffs increased. While the fiscal situation is improving, it is unlikely that this 
objective will be met by the end of the FYO3-05 CAS period. 

9. 
The Bank refrained from planned adjustment lending since the government did not meet 
the fiscal  trigger^.^ The Bank prepared development policy reviews and policy briefs which 
helped focus public attention on key development challenges, including the fiscal deficit. The 
Bank helped the government to meet essential education, health, and social service 
expenditures, such as textbooks, desks, and vaccines, through two Social Expenditure 
Management Projects (SEMP I and 1 1 ) . 
In addition, these projects promoted reform in 
procurement and financial management in the implementing agencies. The Bank supported 
improved public sector management through resources provided by various Asia Europe 
Meeting (ASEM) Trust Funds and Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grants: improving tax 
administration in the Bureau of Internal Revenue; promoting procurement reform and supporting 
implementation of a Procurement Reform Act; and piloting of results based budgeting. A Public 
Expenditure Procurement and Financial Management Review, conducted jointly with the 
government and the Asian Development Bank (ADB), paved the way for the systemic 
implementation of, and capacity building called for, by the Procurement Reform Act and thereby 
contributed to substantial procurement reform, including the harmonization of procurement 
between the government, ADB, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), and the 
Bank. 

Address banking sector problems and deepen capital markets: Banking sector 

I O . 
reform, which gained momentum following the 1997 East Asia crisis, proceeded very slowly. 
The Banking System Reform Loan, an adjustment operation, was cancelled in 2001 because 
conditionality for the second and third tranches was not likely to be met within a reasonable 

' The base case lending program included a proposed Public Finance Strengthening Loan (FY03) and a Public 
Sector Reform Loan (FY04). Base case triggers included improvements in fiscal performance: taxlGNP ratio to 
increase by 0.4 percent per year in 2002-2005; national government deficit/GNP ratio to decline by 0.5 percent 
per year through 2005. These were not met. The government itself had more ambitious targets for deficit 
reduction. The MTPDP targeted the consolidated public sector deficit to decline from 4.3 percent of GNP in 2001 
to 0.6 percent by 2004 and become a surplus of 0.4 percent by 2006. 

Annex 1 
Page 4 of 13 
timeframe. While some progress is being made', many of the issues remain; high level of non- 
performing assets, insufficient provisioning, and weak legal and regulatory environment. Debt 
markets have grown, but government debt is crowding out private borrowings. The Bank and 
the IMF conducted a Financial Sector Assessment (FSAP) and two Report on the Observance 
of Standards and Codes (ROSC) modules (accounting and corporate governance); both 
institutions have maintained a dialogue with the government in the context of the FSAP follow 
up. While progress is being made on banking reform, weaknesses in the financial sector are 
still a major concern for private sector development in the Philippines. The Bank fell short of 
meeting this strategic objective. 

lmprove the investment climate and enhance competitiveness: Concerns over the 

11. 
fiscal deficit, handling of contractual dispute on private infrastructure contracts, and political 
uncertainty have dampened private sector enthusiasm for the Philippines. An Investment 
Climate Assessment carried out by the Bank in FY04 showed that at least 30 percent of the 
firms surveyed saw macroeconomic instability, corruption, and electricity and tax rates as an 
important investment constraint. The Bank is addressing these issues through its 
macroeconomic dialogue, work with the government on governance (see Section D below), and 
operations and dialogue in the power and transportation sectors. Consensus building and 
capacity development on corporate social responsibility in the mining sector were supported 
through workshops, international experience sharing, and capacity building. While the 
Philippines enjoys many advantages in natural resources, labor force and location in a fast 
growing region, it still lags behind other Southeast Asian countries, such as Thailand and 
Malaysia, as a destination for investors. Therefore, the Bank fell short of meeting this strategic 
objective. 

12. 
Alleviate infrastructure bottlenecks: Increased privatization in power and water 
sectors and sustainability of key infrastructure investment and institutions through, among 
others, better cost recovery and financial management, were key country outcomes in the CAS. 
The Bank has helped the government address some of their major infrastructure needs: 254 km 
of national roads were improved and 500 KV lines were installed between Sua1 and Masinloc. 
While Bank-supported projects have been able to provide and/or improve some physical 
facilities, implementation was significantly slower than expected due to procedural delays and 
budget constraints. Moreover, the sustainability of these investments is in doubt because of 
continued institutional weaknesses in key agencies: lack of progress on strengthening 
maintenance and road management in the Department of Public Works and Highways and the 
financial weakness of the National Power Corporation. There was little progress in privatization 
in the power sector, and substantial problems arose in private infrastructure projects in other 
sectors. Infrastructure in the Philippines still lags behind that of other East Asian countries and 
is considered to be a constraint to investment. The Philippine government undertook an 
ambitious program of privatizing infrastructure to address the country's needs. This has proven 
to be a complex undertaking. Privatization is proceeding, but slower than originally anticipated. 
The supply of power and water and sanitation in Metro Manila has improved, but infrastructure 
is still seen as a constraint by private investors. Therefore, the Bank has only partially achieved 
this strategic objective. 

* 

For example, two large batches of non-performing loans were transferred from the banking system to private 
asset management companies, the Philippines Deposit Insurance Corporation charter has been amended, and 
staff afforded greater protection in the discharge of their regulatory duties. 

Annex 1 
Page 5 of 13 

B. Development with Social Equity 

Enhance agriculture sector competitiveness and productivity: At the local level, the 

13. 
Bank continued to provide support to rural communities with a package of infrastructure and 
services. As of June 2004, various Bank projects have funded 1,280 km of rural roads, irrigated 
28,410 ha of land, and constructed 19 post harvest and 50 multi-purpose centers. The 
Implementation Completion Report for the first Agrarian Reform Community Development 
Project (ARCDP I; completed in FY04) indicates that these investments have a positive impact 
on agricultural productivity and household incomes: real household incomes have increased 63 
percent, yields increased 34 percent in project areas. At the national level, the Bank is assisting 
the Department of Agriculture (DA) strengthen its capacity to improve agricultural productivity 
and competitiveness in key crops. The Diversified Farm Income and Market Development 
Project (approved in FY04 after several years of dialogue on reform) supports DA’s efforts to 
move from a traditional public sector, supply-driven approach to a more private sector, marketed 
oriented approach with emphasis on market development, market information. It also seeks to 
strengthen D A s regulatory functions. The Bank is meeting this objective within its project areas. 

Scale up land administration and rural finance: The Bank continued to support the 

14. 
government‘s efforts to improve land administration and increase access to finance in the rural 
areas. The Land Administration and Management Project did not deliver the expected 10,000 
new titles, but assisted the government to develop capacity and streamline procedures to 
provide land titles (347 titles issued, one-stop-shop established), which promises greater 
benefits in the future. The Bank’s third Rural Finance Project supported the Land Bank to 
increase finance in rural areas, creating close to 10,000 rural jobs. However, there is concern 
that the funding mostly reached medium-sized enterprises and is not necessarily getting to 
small poor farmers. The Bank is making progress in strengthening land administration and rural 
finance, but the progress is falling short of initial expectations (in the number of titles provided, 
reaching the poor). This objective has been partially achieved. 

Protect the environment and natural resource base: The Bank has been assisting 

15. 
the government to address natural resource management through projects and Analytical and 
Advisory Activities (AM). Bank projects have led to 88,890 ha of marine areas, 1,594 ha of 
mangrove areas, and the placement of 6,690 ha of upland areas under environmental 
management. The Bank has also assisted the government to improve water resource 
management (water resource plans and watershed improvement plans) and helped to build 
consensus for a national minerals policy for environmentally sustainable mining. Bank projects 
(Community Based Resource Management and Laguna De Bay Institutional Development and 
Community Participation projects) have engaged local governments in the preservation of their 
local environments. The Bank has raised awareness of environmental issues through its AM 
and instituted protection measures in project areas. This objective is being met in project areas. 

Ensure participation, benefit, and ownership of local stakeholders: Community- 

16. 
based approaches (increasing community voice in developing investments in line with their 
needs) is a growing feature of the Bank’s local infrastructure and service operations. All recent 
community-oriented projects (ARCPD II, KALAHI-CISS, and ARMM Social Fund Projects) have 
strong community participation. Participation is now an essential part of Bank community 
oriented operations and KALAHI is seen as an important program by the government. The 
Bank has achieved this objective. 

Annex 1 
Page 6 of 13 

17. 

Focus on the poor in development programs and target poorer regions, especially 
Mindanao and the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM): A large proportion of 

the Bank’s portfolio aimed to promote development and increase incomes in poor regions, 
especially in Mindanao, which has become a focal point for Bank operations. The Bank has 
conducted studies to assess the specific needs of Mindanao: Human Development Study for 
ARMM and a Mindanao needs assessment for reconstruction in Mindanao, conducted jointly by 
several bilateral and multilateral donor agencies, which provided a wider assessment. Specific 
operations focused on Mindanao (the Mindanao Rural Development Project and the ARMM 
Social Fund) provided basic infrastructure and identified priority services by the communities. 
The Bank is working with other donors to coordinate aid in Mindanao, organizing and co- 
chairing with the government the Mindanao Working Group in FY04, championing the creation 
of the Mindanao Discussion Group (co-chaired by UNDP and Japan), and supporting the efforts 
to establish a multi-donor Mindanao Trust Fund once a peace agreement is signed between the 
government and the Mor0 Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). The Bank is meeting this objective. 

C. Comprehensive Human Development Through Access to Basic Services 

Improve investments in human resources (education and health) and ensure 

18. 
access by the poor: In education, the Bank assisted the Department of Education (DepED) to 
provide basic supplies (text books, desks, etc.) and school repair through its projects (the Third 
Elementary Education Project (TEEP), SEMP I & 1 1 ) . To date, Bank projects have constructed 
or improved 25,912 school buildings, provided around 800,000 desks, and supplied over 
seventy million text books. The Bank is also assisting DepED to improve education through 
piloting school-based management (through the restructured TEEP project) and to enhance 
procurement and internal controls (SEMP ISll). Education policy notes addressed issues such 
as education quality, teachers’ performance, school-based management, improving educational 
outcomes among the poor and disadvantaged, and perfecting the efficiency of the education 
system, As for health issues, Bank-supported projects ensured provision for vaccines and basic 
supplies, facilities, and capacity development. To date, close to 130,000 people have received 
tuberculosis drugs and thirty healthcare clinics have been constructed or improved through 
Bank-supported projects. SEMP II strengthened procurement and financial management within 
the Department of Health. The Bank delivered policy notes on lmproving the Poor’s Access to 
Affordable Drugs and On Making Philhealth Policies More Pro-Poor. The Bank has assisted the 
government improve the delivery of education and health supplies which would benefit the poor 
who are not able to afford private alternatives and rely more on the government. The Bank is 
meeting this objective. 

1 9. 

Provide basic services more efficiently (e.g., shelter, water supply, and sanitation) 
and ensure their environmental sustainability: The Bank has made funding available to 

communities, local governments, and water districts for water supply and sanitation investments 
through rural development projects (for rural communities) and water supply projects (for cities 
and urbanized municipalities). To date, 265 rural water systems have been constructed through 
Bank projects. Take-up of Bank funding for water systems in the cities and municipalities has 
been much lower than anticipated because of a combination of factors: changes in 
administration and priorities following elections; local governments’ pursuit of financing at most 
favorable terms (including lobbying the legislature for grants); the “cost of doing business”; and 
the perceived high transaction cost of Bank loans. Within major urban areas, urbanization is 
exacerbating problems of solid waste management and sanitation, with many poor people living 
in unsafe environments. Industrialization and traffic congestion are worsening water and air 
pollution in the cities. The Bank has supported the development of key legislation: the Clean Air 
Act, the Ecological Solid Waste Act, and the Clean Water Act. The Bank’s annual 

Annex 1 
Page 7 of 13 
Environmental Monitor publication is increasing awareness of these issues. The production and 
screening of an audio-video version (i.e., a video on water quality) has been effective in 
reaching a wider audience and generating public interest on the issue. While it has been 
successful in raising awareness of urban environmental issues and assisted the government 
improve water supply and sanitation in Metro Manila, the Bank has been less successful in 
reaching out to secondary cities. Difficulties in tariff reforms raise questions of sustainability of 
water and sanitation investments. The Bank has only partially achieved this objective. 

D. Good and Effective Governance 

20. 
The Bank’s objectives were to: (i) keep a tight “firewall” against graft and corruption in 
Bank financed operations; (ii) improve citizen’s access to information promoting participation; 
(iii) strengthen public sector capacity (increase confidence in the rule of law, improve 
governance to strengthen service delivery); and (iv) improve governance in both the public and 
private sectors, thereby helping to rebuild investor confidence and improve investment efficiency. 
The Bank is meeting these objectives. 

21. 
The government, with support from the Bank and others, is making some progress in 
improving governance. The Bank saw the strengthening of government procurement and 
financial management capacity as well as a greater transparency through civil society 
participation in government as some key country outcomes. The Bank channeled over US$5 
million in grants (ASEM, IDF) to support improvements in governance. These grants, together 
with the Public Expenditure and Procurement and Financial Management Reviews (carried out 
jointly with ADB and the government) paved the way for the systemic implementation of the 
Procurement Reform Act (passed in 2003). Civil society observers are involved in public bid 
committees, providing a greater transparency in the bidding process. As mentioned above, the 
Bank is working with the DepED, the Department of Social Welfare and Development, and the 
Department of Health to strengthen their procurement and financial management (SEMP 1 1 ) . 
The Judicial Reform Project is assisting the Supreme Court implement institutional reforms to 
strengthen public confidence in the judiciary system. To guard against corruption in Bank 
projects, the Bank has strengthened its procurement and financial management staff in the 
Manila office and brought in its Department of Internal Integrity to investigate a GEF grant. The 
Bank has been making progress in these areas, but more effort is needed as corruption 
generally continues to be a significant problem in the Philippinesg. 

22. 
In sum, the Bank has been relatively successful in assisting the government maintain 
education, health, and social services and in providing basic infrastructure and services to rural 
communities and less developed areas, such as Mindanao, through its projects. The Bank has 
reached out to poor communities and promoted community participation in the identification, 
development and implementation of local investments. The Bank has been successful in 
assisting the government strengthen its procurement and administrative procedures. However, 
the Bank was not able to meet it macro-economic objectives. The public sector deficit and high 
levels of public debt will continue to limit the government‘s ability to provide infrastructure, 
facilities and services. The Philippines is seen as lagging behind Indonesia, Thailand, and other 
Asian countries in key economic areas, such as provision of infrastructure and the ability to 
attract private investment. Many key constraints were political and outside of the Bank’s 
immediate sphere of influence. While progress is being made, strengthening the government’s 
ability to deliver services (especially at the local government level) remains a key challenge. 

About 35 percent of the firms surveyed in the Investment Climate Survey saw corruption as a major constraint , 
making it second only to “macroeconomic instability”.

V. Bank Performance 

23. 
Lending: Bank lending for FYOO-04 has been lower than planned. Actual lending was 
US$472 million for FYOO-02 compared to a base case of US$1 .O-1.3 million in the FYOO-02 
CAS and about U S 3 7 9 million projected for FYO3-05 compared to a base case of US$1 .I 
billion in the FYO3-05 CAS. Lack of adjustment lending was a key factor: the FYO3-05 CAS 
included US$750 million in three adjustment loans in the base case scenario. The Bank did not 
go ahead with adjustment lending because the government did not meet the fiscal triggers 
(fiscal deficit reduction and revenue enhancement). The FYO3-05 CAS had anticipated political 
opposition to fiscal reforms as a country risk. Investment projects often took longer than 
anticipated to prepare so that projects were eventually delivered but in many cases not in the 
fiscal year for which they were programmed. The proposed lending program and actuals for 
FYOO-04 are presented in Attachment 2. Of the 23 projects proposed’’, 6 were implemented in 
the programmed fiscal year, 6 were implemented later than programmed, 2 are now 
programmed for subsequent fiscal years, and 9 were dropped. In addition, two additional 
projects, not scheduled in the original program, were approved.” 

24. 
Although lending levels were lower than expected, the Bank was able to initiate some 
innovative projects: engaging the judiciary and lending to the Supreme Court under the Judicial 
Reform Project (FY04); reaching out to communities through KALAHI (FY03); and addressing 
national policy/agency reform issues through support for improved efficiency of expenditures 
within the government’s budget under SEMPll (FY02) and the Diversified Farm Income and 
Market Development Project (FY04). Ownership and engagement by the leadership in the 
relevant government agencies was a critical factor in project development and implementation. 

25. 
Analytical and Advisory Activities: While lending has been limited, the Bank has 
maintained an active AAA program responding to the government‘s need for knowledge and 
technical assistance. AAA activities are listed in Attachment 3. As discussed under Section Ill 
above, many have had a significant impact on the government: the Development Reviews 
(FY02 and FY04) helped focus discussion on key issues such as the fiscal deficit; the Country 
Procurement Assessment Report / Country Financial Accountability Assessment (FY02) and 
related technical assistance contributed to the development of the Procurement Reform Act; 
and the Environmental Monitors for air and water quality raised awareness of the issues. 

26. 
In order to improve the impact of its AAA program, the Bank has been reaching out to 
the public at large, in addition to the traditional government and immediate stakeholder 
audiences. Through greater outreach, the Bank aimed to: (i) increase awareness of the 
challenges facing the Philippines; [ii) develop an understanding and foster trust of the Bank and 
its operations; and (iii) influence the public’s thinking, especially since many of the issues 
require political action. In addition to the traditional launch events and press releases, the Bank 
expanded dissemination of AAA products through roundtables in the provinces and the 
production and distribution (where appropriate) of audio-video products (i.e., a water quality 
video). 

lo Three projects scheduled in FY02 (River Basin Development, Rural Electrification, and Agrarian Reform) in the 
FYOO-02 CAS were reprogrammed to FY03 and FY04 in the FYO3-05 CAS and are only counted in their original 
fiscal year. 
The Land Administration Management Project was added in FYOI and the Diversified Farm Income and 
Agriculture Modernization Project was advanced from FY05 to FY04. 

Annex 1 
Page 9 of 13 
27. 
The Bank has established seven Knowledge for Development Centers (KDCs) 
nationwide, making available not only Bank publications but also development literature and 
other materials. KDC usage is averaging 400-600 visitors a month. A Global Distance 
Learning Center was set up in the Asian Institute of Management in FY02, beginning with about 
12 courses and sessions in that year. These increased to 75 sessions in FY03 and 101 in FY04, 
enabling the center to post profits in FY03 and FY04 and to strengthen its financial sustainability. 
The Bank actively engaged civil society in the preparation of the FYO3-05 CAS and similarly has 
done so during preparation of the FYO6-08 CAS. 

28. 
An Innovation Market Place was held in January 2004 with the title of Panibagong 
Paraan or “New Ways”. It forged partnerships between key leaders from civil society, academe, 
the business community, development partners, and the government. The Bank was able to 
leverage its US$300,000 allotment, with the total award fund growing to more than US$1 million. 
More than 1,800 proposals were received under the theme “Making Basic Services Work for the 
Poor” and grants were given to more than 50 winners. 

29. 
Portfolio Management: The Bank made portfolio management a priority during the 
CAS period and actively managed its portfolio in partnership with government and other donors. 
A summary of the portfolio indicators is provided in Attachment 4. This shows that overall 
portfolio performance improved over the past two CAS periods. Disbursement improved with 
the disbursement ratio’* improving from 12 percent in FYOI to over 20 percent in FY03 and 
FY04, as problem projects were restructured and non-performing components and activities 
were dropped. 

30. 
The Bank continued to work with the government and development partners to improve 
portfolio performance. The move to joint ODA portfolio reviews (initiated by the Bank in FYOO) 
spurred positive changes, including: focusing senior government officials on portfolio issues; 
development of a “project readiness filter” adopted by government and development partners 
(JBIC, ADB); streamlining of government review processes; strengthening government agencies 
that oversee the ODA portfolio; and focusing attention on effective monitoring and evaluation. 
The Bank intensified efforts to improve implementation capacity, with seminars and workshops 
on procurement, financial management, disbursement, and social and environmental 
assessment for various implementing agencies. An IDF grant financed the improvement of the 
government’s oversight functions. Semi-annual, joint project-level reviews have resulted in 
more continuous assessment and resolution of portfolio issues. 

31. 
The Bank is also working with the government to strengthen the focus on results in 
portfolio reviews. Outputs and outcomes of all projects under implementation were summarized 
using a common results framework, which helped to identify shortfalls in expected 
achievements, and weaknesses in project monitoring. A preliminary assessment was also 
made of results achieved under technical assistance provided through grants. This process will 
be extended to include AAA in portfolio reviews beginning in early 2005. This work, combined 
with the development of a results framework under the new CAS, will allow the Bank and 
government to use results to manage the country assistance program in the Philippines. 

32. 
The Bank is also strengthening coordination among projects involving local governments, 
The Local Government Code of 1991 devolved many functions carried out by national 
government agencies and significantly increased the responsibility of local governments. Both

year. 

Annex 1 
Page 10 of 13 

national and local governments have been struggling to adjust to this new environment. The 
Bank’s sector-focused approach, working primarily through national government agencies, 
promoted a number of successful models for improved delivery of devolved functions, but did 
not necessarily encourage a consistent approach across local governments. The Bank took 
steps to address this issue by: (i) creating the Local Government Portal which allows local 
governments to obtain information on Bank support available to them through the Bank’s 
website; (ii) developing an Interactive Project Map that allows people to view Bank projects in 
their localities through the website; and (iii) conducting a workshop on joint supervision of all 
projects providing services at the local level. This workshop identified the potential for 
streamlining and simplifying procedures for local government, with increased focus on the core 
development priorities and capacity requirements of local governments. A development 
partners working group on local governments is being reactivated to promote greater 
harmonization of local development efforts. The government‘s decision in late 2004 to limit 
national government grant financing of devolved activities to local governments required further 
rethinking of the Bank’s approach towards local governments. 

33. 
Aid Coordination: The Bank worked effectively with its development partners. The 
Bank continues to collaborate closely with the IMF, ADB, JBIC, and key development partners 
through its leadership in the Consultative Group and the Quarterly Development Partners 
Breakfast Group. The Bank is taking an active role in coordinating assistance to Mindanao 
through a needs assessment completed jointly with other development partners and the 
preparation of a proposed multi-donor Mindanao Trust Fund. 

34. 
On harmonization, the Bank: (i) regularly conducts joint quarterly reviews of the portfolio 
with government, ADB, and JBIC; (ii) completed a joint Public Expenditure Procurement and 
Financial Management Review with ADB (together with the government); and (iii) harmonized 
procurement around the government‘s new procurement law. The Bank worked with the 
government and other partners to complete standard national competitive bidding documents 
for goods, works, and consulting services, which are now being widely disseminated. Some 
progress was also made on harmonizing financial reporting formats and developing a common 
approach to land acquisition and resettlement 

VI. Client Feedback 

35. 
As part of the CAS Completion Report, senior Filipino officials who have been involved 
with Bank operations were interviewed to obtain feedback on the effectiveness of the Bank in 
the Philippines. These interviews focused on their perceptions of the Bank’s key 
accomplishments and shortfalls during 2000-04 and the Bank’s contribution to meeting their 
agency’s strategic objectives. 

36. 
Overall, the Bank’s clients gave a favorable view of the institution. When asked to rate 
the Bank performance on a scale of 1-1 0 (with 1 being totally ineffective and 10 being extremely 
effective), most responded with a 7 or 8. They clearly saw the value of working with Bank staff. 
The increasing decentralization of Bank operations to the country office was seen as beneficial. 
Many officials talked about how they had benefited from the knowledge they obtained through 
interaction with staff, especially on experiences from other countries. Based on this feedback, 
the Bank’s strengths are in its: 

Annex 1 
Page 11 of 13 

Convener role: leadership among donors; “honest broker” among conflicting 
stakeholders. 
Knowledge: quality of analysis; knowledge transfers (both formal and informal); and 
strength o f a global institution. 
0 Willingness and ability to develop approaches that address client needs: The Bank was 
seen as “innovative”, “responsive”, and “flexible”. 

37. 
The Bank also created opportunities to “learn by doing”. For example, Bank projects 
provided a model for the Departments of Agrarian Reform, Agriculture, and Environment and 
Natural Resources to work with local governments in a decentralized environment; SEMP I & II 
allowed the Departments of Health, Education, and Social Welfare to implement procurement 
and financial management reform. 

?3 

38. 
Clients often cited as keys to success experiences in which they felt they and the Bank 
had been able to work well together during project development and restructuring in a truly 
collaborative manner. Similarly, some clients cited cases where they felt they had not been 
engaged durin project preparation as a shortcoming - often a non-lead agency in a multi- 
agency project . 
39. 
Through nterviews, complaints emerged over the “cost of doing business” - procurement 
review delays, safeguards “over-kill,” and special account amounts. However, there was no 
overarching issue, with different agencies citing problems with diverse aspects. Several 
agencies appreciated the Bank for having a greater number of local procurement and financial 
management staff in Manila. 

40. 
There is still area for improvement. When asked where the Bank could do more, one 
respondent mentioned the need to return the focus more on strengthening economic 
competitiveness. Another suggested taking a systematic approach to local government 
capacity building. For instance, significant resources go into capacity building through multiple 
projects, but as these activities are not well coordinated, the country may not be getting full 
return on the overall investment in capacity building. 

VII. Conclusions and Lessons Going Fotward 

41. 
The Bank has responded flexibly in assisting the Philippine government address its 
development challenges, at a time when the sense of urgency for change following the East 
Asia financial crisis may be fading. The Bank continued to assist the Philippine government 
address their infrastructure and service needs not only through traditional investment loans, but 
also through budgetary support for key social expenditures (SEMP I & 1 1 ) . The Bank also 
reached out to communities to help address their immediate needs (KALAHI), initiated 
innovative approaches (e.g., Judicial Reform), and worked with the government to strengthen 
administrative practices (e.g., procurement and financial management). Many challenges 
remain, however. Poverty continues to be a concern with over 35 million people (44 percent) 
living on less than US$2 a day in 2003. The Philippines continues to face the degradation of 
natural resources despite the progress being made in Bank project areas. Macroeconomic 

l3 For example, the Water Districts Project was initially prepared with the Department of the Interior and Local 
Government in the lead and the Development Bank of the Philippines was later brought in when the need for a 
financial intermediary became apparent. 

Annex 1 
Page 12 of 13 
instability, corruption, and poor infrastructure continue to be identified as key constraints to 
private investment. 

42. While the country has not been able to meet a key macroeconomic objective of the CAS 
-- increasing tax revenues and reducing the fiscal deficit -- the Bank adapted to the situation, 
concentrating on AA 4 to address constraints which were within the Bank’s (and the 
government’s) area of influence. The Bank identified political reluctance to proceed with critical 
aspects of the reform program as a country risk and pro-actively managed it by reaching out to 
a variety of stakeholders, opinion leaders, and the public at large to raise awareness of the 
challenges facing the Philippines. While lending volumes have been below targets, the Bank 
was correct to set clear fiscal triggers for adjustment lending and to stand by them. 

43. 
Overall, the Bank’s performance in the Philippines is satisfactory. The CAS did not 
provide a clear statement of what the Bank intended to achieve, making this evaluation difficult. 
The Bank did not achieve some traditional markers, such as the volume of lending planned. At 
the same time, the Bank adapted to the situation in the Philippines, exploring ways with the 
government to address their priorities. Strong positive feedback from the government on the 
Bank’s performance, especially its willingness to listen to and to work with the client, is an 
endorsement of this flexible approach. 

44.

Key lessons going forward are as follows. The Bank should: 
Build on its strong relationship with the client and continue to strengthen country 
ownership of the program. The Bank will need to: (i) collaborate closely with its clients in 
operations and fully incorporate their needs and priorities; and (ii) ensure that clients 
continue to see the Bank’s inputs as relevant, responsive, and innovative. Being 
innovative does not necessarily mean taking state-of-the-art solutions to problems, but 
working with the client to adapt experiences and knowledge from other countries to the 
situation in the Philippines. 
Continue its outreach to political leaders, opinion leaders (i.e., the media), and civil 
society to build awareness of and promote consensus on the challenges facing the 
Philippines and the Bank’s position on these issues. Increasing revenues, reducing the 
fiscal deficit, and containing contingent liabilities will continue to be core challenges 
facing the government. Many of the solutions are political, requiring action by the 
legislature. The Bank will need to continue its “honest broker role,” but should be 
realistic about what can be accomplished in the near term. 
Continue to focus on improving portfolio performance. While the CAS tends to highlight 
new operations for the coming years, a significant amount of resources remain to be 
transferred to the Philippines. As of September 2004, there was an undisbursed 
balance of about U S 6 8 6 million out of total commitments of US$1.2 billion over 23 
projects (including GEF). These projects will have a more immediate impact than 
operations currently in, or to be included in, the pipeline. 
Further coherence among Bank projects involving local governments. In the past, local 
governments were often seen as critical implementers of various sectoral strategies, 
rather than as units of government in themselves. Going forward, local government 
programs should: (i) strengthen local ownership by addressing their priorities; and (ii) 
take a systematic approach to key cross-cutting areas such as capacity building and 
revenue enhancement . 

Annex I 
Page 13 of 13 

Continue to strengthen its focus on results. The move to results-based CASs provides 
an opportunity to get a better handle on key strategic outcomes at the country level 
around which the Bank should focus its program. It is critical to: (i) select a limited 
number of core medium-term outcomes; (ii) develop indicators to measure progress 
towards these outcomes; and (iii) establish clear links with the portfolio, proposed 
lending, and proposed AAA. These should be developed with the government and used 
to jointly monitor progress on the program. The Bank needs to be selective, but this 
does not necessarily mean selecting which sectors the program will focus. The Bank 
should be selective in what it realistically can achieve during the FYO6-08 CAS period. 
Various operations should be assessed based on the contribution they can make 
towards achieving these objectives.

CAS Cons u It at i o n s 
and Client Survey Summary 

1. 
The preparation of the FY2006-08 Country Assistance Strategy of the Bank Group drew 
on various dialogue and feedback mechanisms, including a CAS Completion Report (Annex I ) , 
a client survey, in addition to a series of formal and informal meetings with key opinion leaders 
from various sectors and with government officials from oversight and implementing agencies. 
Feedback was also received from a government CAS counterpart group, set up to coordinate 
with the Bank Group on the CAS process and its substance. 

2. 
In collaboration with NGOs, the private sector, and the government, the Bank Group also 
held various conferences and workshops around the country with youth representatives. The 
findings of these gatherings were incorporated by the government in its Youth Assessment 
Study and National Youth Development Plan, and were also considered in the formulation of the 
Bank Group’s CAS. Youth groups voiced some pessimism about their future, as reflected in 
discussions on: substance abuse, reproductive health, education, and employment 
opportunities. The underlying theme of all the discussions, however, was the need for the youth 
to think more critically about their own situation, articulate their needs, and do everything they 
can to pursue their dreams and visions for a better life. 

3. 
Separate meetings were also held with other development partners, both bilateral and 
multilateral agencies. Through small and large meetings, the Bank Group heard the views of its 
various stakeholders on the development needs of the country over the next three years and 
views on how the Bank Group can assist the government and other development partners in 
addressing these needs. 

4. 
This Annex reports on the process and results of the more structured and formal multi- 
stakeholder meetings and the client survey, which complemented the other forms of 
consultations. 

Mu It i -S t a ke h o I de r Cons u I tat i o n s 

5 . 
Building on the consultations conducted for the previous two CAS’S prepared in 1999 
and 2003, as well as its regular outreach and dialogue activities, the Bank Group organized 
multi-stakeholder consultation workshops across the country. These workshops involved 
national (executive, legislative, and judicial) and local governments; civil society; the business 
community/private sector; academe; labor groups; and other development partners. The 
workshops were designed to gather the views of the stakeholders on: the critical problems 
facing the country, policy options and programs that will lead to better development outcomes 
over the medium-term; and, how the Bank Group can improve its programs of assistance and 
operations in the country. 

6. 
Close to 300 participants attended the workshops held between August and October 
2004. The national government representatives comprised the bulk of the participants (38 
percent), followed by representatives from civil society and labor (28 percent), LGUs (16 
percent), and academe (1 2 percent). All consultation workshops were done in partnership with 
the government’s central planning agency, the National Economic Development Authority 
(NEDA). As the government’s Medium Term Philippine Development Plan (MTPDP) was also 

Annex 2 
Page 2 of 7 

being finalized during the same period of the CAS consultations, it was an opportune time for 
the government to present the draft MTPDP to a wider group of stakeholders. 

7 . 
Two meetings were held in Manila, and one meeting each was held in Tuguegarao, 
Cebu, and Davao. The active participation of high-level local chief executives from Mindanao 
(Davao) and the Visayas (Cebu) regions was quite impressive. Except for one meeting in 
Manila, all the CAS consultations were organized in partnership with the Bank’s Knowledge for 
Development Centers: St. Paul University, University of Southeastern Philippines, University of 
San Carlos, Silliman University, and the Asian Institute of Management. 

8. 
Consistent with the thrust towards making the CAS more thematic (focusing on cross- 
sectoral rather than purely sectoral issues) and results-oriented, the consultations also followed 
a process that: validated the broad themes and the critical measures that would comprise a 
strategic action agenda for the country, initially formulated by the Bank Group. In general, the 
consultations confirmed the importance of the four emergent CAS themes -- growth, social 
inclusion, fiscal stability, and governance. The Bank Group also used consultations to discuss 
the proposed platform approach to implement its assistance strategy (national government, 
local government, and private sector). 

9. 
The key messages and implications for Bank Group assistance gathered from the 
consultation workshops are summarized in the table below. A detailed feedback report was 
sent to all the participants and more details were posted on the Bank’s Philippines website to 
inform the general public about its messages and recommendations. As the goal was to listen 
to a wide spectrum of voices and not to build a consensus, these details would show some 
divergent views and opinions of various sectors across the country. 

I O . 
An elaboration of the main messages related to the four CAS themes is discussed 
below. The stakeholder’s views on the proposed platform approach to implement the Bank 
Group assistance strategy is also considered. 

11. 
Growth While the Philippines has been able to grow at a modest rate in the last three 
years, the growing population requires a more accelerated economic growth performance in 
order to significantly reduce poverty. There was consensus that economic growth will be difficult 
to achieve if the current fiscal and governance issues are not addressed. There was a very 
strong clamor for the government to: show political will in pursuing revenue measures to avert a 
possible economic crisis; and to rally the people towards supporting necessary measures which 
may be painful to implement but which may be more bearable than a full-blown economic crisis. 

12. 
Based on the consultations, the attainment of economic growth in the medium-term will 
hinge on: 
addressing infrastructure bottlenecks; 
raising investments particularly in identified priority sectors where the country has 
comparative advantage; 
developing further the financial market; 
arresting the declining competitiveness of the country; 
developing a globally competitive labor force; and 
promoting the sustainable use of natural resources. 

Key Messages to the Bank Group from Multi-Stakeholder Consultations 

Annex 2 
Page 3 of 7 

Growth 

Promoting pro-poor growth will not only 
require more investments at the national 
level but should also: (i) address 
impediments to local development; (ii) 
encourage community-based industries. 
Addressing growth and social inclusion will 
increasingly require looking at greater roles 
for LGUs and better coordinative 
mechanisms between national government 
agencies and LGUs. 
Explore more active involvement of the IFC 
in local level investments. 

Social Inclusion 

Support provision of poverty targeted grants 
and expand community-driven development 
projects to promote improved governance 
at local levels. 
Support rural infrastructure, advocacy to 
improve institutional and regulatory 
environment for farmers, and human capital 
development. 
Support delivery of social services to poor 
communities by converg i ng poverty- re la ted 
services at the local level and improving 
coordination between national and local 
governments 
Support marginalized groups to voice their 
needs and to be involved in community 
undertakings. 
Assist the government in formulating safety 
nets for vulnerable groups. 

Fiscal Stability 

It is urgent to undertake fiscal reform. 
Support advocacy for fiscal reform among 
different sectors; share experiences of tax 
and other measures implemented by 
countries during crises. 
Coordinate with other development partners 
in packaging a comprehensive program loan 
linked to policy reforms. 
Provide credit enhancements to the 
government’s capital market operations 
linked to policy reforms. 
Assist the government in addressing GOCC 
problems (e.g., NPC), and in strengthening 
oversight agencies like DOF, NEDA, and 
OA. 

Govern an ce 

Growth and human development are 
contingent on improving governance at all 
levels. 
Support a governance reform package with 
LGU and national government level 
components to make decentralization work 
better; include capacity building in planning, 
poverty targeting, management, monitoring 
and evaluation, etc. 
Private direct assistance to LGUs; adopt 
innovative models for financing. 
Support projects and programs that 
improve efficiency and transparency of 
government operations similar to the e- 
procuremen t project. 

13. 
There was also a strong call to localize economic growth and to institute policies that 
would promote a more balanced rural-urban growth through increased investments outside 
Metro Manila for the development of community-based industries.

14. 
Social lnclusion Consistent with the pursuit of growth is the need to work towards 
greater social inclusion and more equitable distribution of income in the country. The 
consultations highlighted the need to: 
promote sectors that can generate employment and improving the productivity of 
workers; 
improve access of the people to productive assets (e.g., land) and to services like 
education and health; 
empower marginalized and vulnerable groups through social protection and safety net 
programs to prevent them from being poor or from falling deeper into poverty, especially 
with the vulnerability of the Philippines to crisis situations; 
address population issues; 
provide programs for youth; and 
enjoin civil society groups, the community, and the private sector in general to participate 
more actively in the planning, implementation, and monitoring of social sector projects.

15. 
The consultations also discussed the increasing role of LGUs in the delivery of basic 
social services at the community level. More efficient service delivery to poor communities, 
which is partly dependent on the convergence of poverty-related services at the local level, 
however, requires improving the coordination between the national government and the LGUs. 
At the same time, the consultations also called for more participatory governance through the 
implementation of more community-driven development projects, replicable in other poverty 
areas in the country. 

16. 
Fiscal Stability In general, workshop participants expressed impatience with the pace 
of the government’s response to the fiscal problem. This was partly due to the slow action of 
the legislative branch, perhaps traced to the lack of appreciation of the gravity and urgency of 
the fiscal situation, as well as to the perceived need for stronger leadership of the executive 
branch. The consultations called on the government to recognize the seriousness of the 
problem and to rally the people towards supporting solutions. It was also suggested that 
individuals and academic groups work together as policy champions, giving briefings to the 
public on the implications of a possible economic crisis and of the proposed revenue measures 
to the lives of ordinary Filipinos. 

17. 
Recognizing the difficulty of legislating the needed revenue measures proposed by the 
executive branch, the consultations suggested to: 
formulate contingency measures consisting of a “second best” reform agenda in case 
congress fails to pass the revenue measures which could include temporarily closing 
sources of revenue leakages such as duty free shops and alternative tax measures used 
in countries with similar problems; 
pursue expenditure management reforms such as the reorganization of government; and 
focus on cash-strapped government-owned and controlled corporations (e.g., NPC and 
NFA) and oversight agencies (e.g., DOF, NEDA, COA); and implement procurement 
reforms, especially at the local levels. 

18. 
Governance Weak governance at the national and local levels was generally 
perceived as derailing the country’s development. The discussions went beyond the usual 
concerns about corruption towards a discussion on the means of making public institutions work 

Annex 2 
Page 5 of 7 

better for the common good with greater accountability and quality of service being required 
from public servants. 

19. 
There was also a strong clamor for promoting good governance at the local level, where 
there has been exemplary models of effective service delivery or “islands of good governance” 
in recent years, which were proposed to be replicated. It was generally believed that the 
effective implementation of the Local Government Code offers potential opportunities for 
improving public service delivery at the sub-national levels. 

20. 
Promoting just and sustainable peace especially in Mindanao was, likewise, identified as 
a critical factor for the country’s development. A combination of peace-keeping efforts and 
social development interventions is important in the pursuit of lasting peace in the country. 

Strengthening the National Government The attainment of the country’s 

21. 
development agenda is premised on the national government’s ability to exercise strong political 
will and leadership to implement needed economic and political reforms. The consultations 
highlighted the politics of policy making as an important consideration in the pursuit of growth 
particularly: 
consistent implementation of policies even with changes in administration; 
participatory policy making which calls for constant consultation with stakeholders, 
including local government officials; and 
improved coordination among branches of government, and between the national and 
local governments, in policy formulation, implementation and monitoring. 

0 

22. 
The necessity of closer coordination is more crucial between the national government 
and the LGUs in the effort to make decentralization work better through the LGUs’ increased 
responsibility in the delivery of basic services. In relation to this, the consultations called for the 
transformation of the national government’s role vis-a-vis the LGUs, in which the former focuses 
on standard or performance benchmarking, incentive setting, and performance monitoring 
rather than the traditional project implementation even for devolved functions. To assist the 
national government in the implementation of the MTPDP at the local level, the LGUs are 
proposing a “burden-sharing,” scheme based on a two-way arrangement in which LGUs will be 
tasked with more responsibilities and accountability for the implementation of critical MTPDP- 
related projects which are to be matched with resources from the national government for 
project implementation. 

23. 
In line with the objective of improving good governance is the importance of streamlining 
government operations involving the entire public sector from the executive to the judicial 
branches, as a means to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery. 
Specifically, the consultations pinpointed the importance to: 
address graft and corruption in “high profile” agencies like tax collecting agencies; 
make agencies accountable to the public; and 
focus efforts on the agencies that are critical to the attainment of economic growth such 
as peace-keeping agency levels (e.g., Philippine National Police) and the judicial 
system. 

0 

24. 
The consultations identified examples of “islands of good governance” both at the 
national and local agencies which need to be more systematically scaled-up nationwide. 

Annex 2 
Page 6 of 7 

25. 
Building LGU Capacity To make decentralization work better, LGUs should be 
assisted through capacity-building measures in planning, including poverty reduction, income 
generation, project programming, and budgeting and monitoring. Recognizing that many LGUs 
are dependent on central government transfers through the Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA), 
the consultations recognized the importance of assisting LGUs to be financially independent of 
the national government by improving their capability to raise revenues and other capital 
resources. In line with this, the LGUs have appealed to both the national government and 
multilateral and bilateral development agencies to review existing financing mechanisms 
available to LGUs in order to increase their access to both grants and direct loans and/or to 
facilitate the processing of their loan requirements through existing windows like the Municipal 
Development Fund. 

26. 
Part of LGU strengthening is the promotion of participatory governance, which partly 
entails enjoining communities to have a stronger role in planning and implementing local 
projects most beneficial to them. This would be implemented partly by strengthening civil 
society’s partnership with local governments in all aspects of governance. 

lncreasing Private Sector Role in Development While the private sector remains the 

27. 
engine of growth in the country, the government has called on the business community to play a 
greater role in attaining social development goals, especially given the present fiscal problems. 
On service delivery, the private sector can partner with government in its poverty reduction 
programs. To improve governance, the private sector is encouraged to set up systems for 
monitoring public sector performance in public works, procurement, among others. 

28. 
In line with participatory governance, the consultations affirmed the importance of 
greater involvement of civil society organizations not only in monitoring public sector 
performance but also in the planning and implementation of projects and programs. lncreasing 
involvement by civil society organizations, however, would entail not only their participation in 
meetings and conferences but also increasing their capacity to understand, analyze, advocate, 
and monitor policies as well as programs and projects. 

Client Survey 

29. 
All workshop participants were invited to provide their opinions on the Bank Group’s 
assistance to the country by participating in a client survey. A total of 148 stakeholders (54 
percent) participated in the client survey through a self-administered questionnaire. The survey 
requested respondents’ views on: overall attitudes toward the Bank Group; its greatest value 
and weakness; the importance of specific areas of its work and its effectiveness in those areas; 
its effectiveness in the way it does business; their level of agreement with a series of statements 
about the Bank Group’s projects and programs; and questions about general issues facing the 
Philippines, including whether the country is headed in the right direction and its highest priority 
development challenges. In addition, respondents were asked about the Bank Group’s 
communication and outreach efforts and how it should best be involved in the country’s 
development. 

30. 
The client survey results indicate that the Bank Group is performing at a high level in 
certain areas, with some indication of areas that may require more attention and focus. The 
results also showed that the relationships between the Bank Group and its stakeholders (those 
represented at the meeting in which the client survey was distributed) are strong and positive.

Other interesting findings from the client survey include: 
Respondents identified poverty reduction and corruption as the top development 
priorities in the Philippines. They reported that the Philippines is not moving in the right 
direction in terms of reducing corruption. 
This view of corruption may be the prism through which stakeholders view development 
progress. Respondents may be less optimistic about the overall progress taking place in 
the Philippines (in terms of development) because they do not believe much can really 
change until this challenge is managed more effectively. As possible evidence of this, 
more than 40 percent of respondents reported that the Philippines is moving in the 
wrong direction (overall). 
In contrast with their views on corruption, stakeholders believe that a fair amount of 
progress is being made on a number of other areas including ensuring access to clean 
water, managing the economy, and promoting growth. 
Stakeholders see a broad role for the Bank Group in the Philippines -- particularly 
related to sectors - as well as a fair amount of support for more Bank Group 
involvement. At the same time, while a bit less than half of respondents reported that 
the Bank Group should continue its strategy of working in “all areas with all players,’’ 
many others said the Bank Group should either work primarily with local governments or 
local communities. The survey findings do not indicate a “mandate” for any of the 
approaches described. 
The Bank Group is considered fairly effective in a broad range of areas, including many 
of the areas that are considered high priority such as poverty reduction. However, there 
are a number of areas that are tangentially related to corruption, where expectations 
exceed performance. These include transparency and governance, and improving 
accountability in the use of public funds. 
Those outside government have a much lower level of familiarity with the Bank Group 
than those inside government (based on this specific sample of meeting attendants). In 
most surveys related to the Bank Group’s work, it has been shown that the more familiar 
stakeholders are with the Bank Group, the more effective they consider the institution. 
According to data analysis, this is true in the Philippines as well. 
There is nearly unanimous support for increased community-driven development in the 
Philippines. Most stakeholders are familiar with CDD; a large percentage thinks it is 
effective, and nearly all stakeholders believe that this approach should be more 
widespread.

Country Financing Parameters

The Bank’s overall financing share 
is not expected to change 
significantly in aggregate level, with 
expected increase in sector-wide 
assistance (in which the Bank’s 
financing share is typically low). 
Projects implemented by local 
governments will likely include some 
counterpart funding. For projects 
implemented by government-owned 
corporations, evidence of ownership 
and commitment would be 
assessed, taking account of budget 
and planning processes and project 
cost sharing. One hundred percent 
Bank financing could be provided for 
some projects and activities with 
strong evidence of ownership and 
commitment. 

Integration of Bank financing in the 
budget process ensures that 
increased recurrent cost financing 
would not jeopardize overall debt and 
fiscal sustainability. The Bank will 
continue to monitor the overall fiscal 
situation and its implications for 
recurrent cost financing. At the 
project level, recurrent cost financing 
could be considered if consistent with 
project objectives, provided there is 
strong demonstration of arrangements 
to ensure sustainability after Bank 
financing ceases. 

Item 

Parameter 

Remarks I Explanation

Yes 

Local cost financing Are the 

requirements for Bank financing of 
local expenditures met, namely 
that: (i) financing requirements for 
the country’s development program 
would exceed the public sector’s 
own resources (e.g., from taxation 
and other revenues) and expected 
domestic borrowing; and (ii) the 
financing of foreign expenditures 
alone would not enable the Bank to 
assist in the financing of individual 
projects. 

Taxes and duties Are there any 

taxes and duties that the Bank 
would not finance? 

None 

The two requirements for Bank local 
cost financing are met. Therefore 
the Bank may finance local costs in 
the proportions needed in individual 
projects. 

Taxes and duties are considered 
reasonable. At the project level, the 
Bank would consider whether taxes 
and duties taxes and duties 
constitute an excessively high share 
of projects costs. The Bank would 
monitor local taxes for possible 
distortions and that these maintain 
consistent acceptable practices.
