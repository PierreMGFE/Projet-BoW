ii. 

i. A f te r t w o years o f deep crisis, the Dom in ican Repub l ic has begun t o turn a corner. The 
peso has appreciated, i n f l a t i o n has come down, and economic g r ow t h has resumed. The new 
Government o f Leone1 FernBndez, wh ich took o f f i c e in August 2004, has assigned p r i o r i t y t o 
res to r ing mac roeconom ic s tab i l i ty and has successfully negotiated a Stand-B y Arrangement 
(SBA) w i t h the IMF, approved b y i t s B o a r d o n January 3 1,2005. 
No tw i ths tand ing this achievement, fo rm idab le challenges remain. M o s t are re la ted t o weak 
governance and f rag i le p u b l i c institutions. Co r rup t ion remains widespread and the D om i n i c a n 
Repub l ic has ye t t o f u l l y emerge f r o m the shadow o f i t s caud i l l is t past and embrace the 
demands o f a mode rn state. Other challenges inc lude entrenched inequa l i ty and r u r a l pove r ty , 
uncontrolled, r a p i d urbanization, you th unemployment, and social exclusion. Addressing these 
ins t i tu t iona l , economic, and social challenges w i l l requ i re far-reaching measures t o r e f o rm the 
p u b l i c sector and im p r o v e the e f f ic iency , transparency and accoun tab i l i ty o f the use o f p u b l i c 
funds. 
I t w i l l also requ i re v is ib le actions t o reach poo r households w i t h basic social and 
in f ras t ruc tu re services, and de l ive r jobs f o r the young. This i s a t a l l agenda, especially in a 
h i g h l y p o l i t i c a l env i ronmen t and in the context o f imm i n e n t trade p o l i c y changes expos ing the 
coun t ry t o n ew and tougher compe t i t ion .

The guiding p r inc ip les f o r the W o r l d B a n k G roup ’s assistance p rog ram in the D om i n i c a n 
Repub l ic f o r the nex t fou r years are: (i) a strategic approach, a imed at steering B a n k G roup 
f inanc ing and ana ly t ica l w o r k t o c r i t ica l areas o f p o l i c y re fo rm ; (ii) selectivity, focus ing o n 
areas where the B a n k G roup has a comparative advantage and where there i s a gap in 
assistance; and (iii) ac t ive pa r tne r ing in b o t h l e n d i n g and ana ly t ica l w o r k w i t h other 
development partners. 
The W o r l d B a n k Group’s strategy over the fou r -yea r pe r iod cove red b y th is C A S (FY06- 
0 9 ) supports the Government’s program. 
I t s ove r -a rch ing focus i s o n im p r o v i n g governance 
and strengthening ins t i tu t ions . T w o m a i n Pillars support this focus: 
(i) stabilize the economy, imp rove competitiveness, and restore economic g row th ; and 
(ii) achieve greater soc ia l equ i ty th rough human deve lopmen t and increased coverage and 
qua l i ty o f basic p u b l i c services. 
IBRD support w i l l focus o n p r o v i d i n g techn ica l and f inanc ia l assistance f o r e lec t r ic i ty 
sector restructuring, and p u b l i c sector mode rn iza t ion and competitiveness w i t h strong 
emphasis o n comba t ing co r rup t ion , and inc reas ing transparency, accountability, and respect f o r 
the ru le o f law . The B a n k w i l l also support the deve lopmen t and imp lemen ta t ion o f a na t iona l 
wastewater and s o l i d waste strategy. 
I t w i l l , in addition, accompany the government in 
im p r o v i n g targeting o f soc ia l programs, inc reas ing access t o basic social and in f ras t ruc tu re 
services w i t h an emphasis o n poo r r u r a l and u rban areas, women and you th at risk. Th rough i t s 
ex is t ing po r t fo l io , IBRD w i l l continue t o support f inanc ia l sector re fo rm , and education and 
hea l th sector interventions, i n c l u d i n g the Gove rnmen t ’s HIV-AIDS strategy. As pa r t o f the 
assistance program, IBRD w i l l undertake ana ly t ica l w o r k i n c l u d i n g a Pove r ty Assessment, a 
Coun t ry Econom ic Memo randum , a study o n P u b l i c Transport f o r the U r b a n Poor, and

IFC ’s assistance w i l l focus o n res to r ing confidence in the p r iva te sector suppo r t ing projects 
generating growth, im p r o v i n g the country’s competitiveness, and con t r ibu t ing towards greater 
social equ i ty . 
IFC’s in te rven t ion w i l l be concentrated in areas where the coun t ry has a 
compe t i t ive advantage o r that are ha rd currency earners o f the economy-tourism, m in ing , and 
free trade zone (notably deve lop ing i nw a r d linkages towards the l o c a l economy); and human 
resources development (health and education). 
In other sectors such as 
infrastructure 
(transport and logistics, renewable energy, water and waste management) IFC w i l l support 
p ro jec ts as opportunities arise. I F C w i l l also seek t o assist the government r e f o rm e f fo r ts in the 
f inanc ia l and e lec t r ic i ty sectors, b y supporting p r iva te sector inves tmen t that c o u l d resu l t in a 
sound regu la to ry f ramewo rk .

sectors, w o r k i n g w i t h p ro jec t sponsors w h o a re exp lo r ing long - te rm investments in the country. 
The preparation o f this CAS , i t s lend ing and ana ly t ica l program, has been done in close 
co l labo ra t ion w i t h the government, and has bene f i ted f r o m consultations at p rov inc ia l and 
na t iona l workshops i n c l u d i n g representatives f r o m l o c a l governments, c i v i l society and the 
p r iva te sector, as w e l l as you th focus discussions. There has been close coo rd ina t ion w i t h the 
IDB, and other development partners.

In the wake o f the wo rs t economic crisis to hit the coun t ry in decades, in M a y 2004 the 
Dom in ican popu la t ion re-elected Leone1 Fe rn indez t o the presidency w i t h a mandate t o l i f t the 
coun t ry ou t o f t h e crisis and pave the way f o r renewed g r ow t h and recovery. T h e i n c om i n g

austerity and sought t o reassure the international markets his adm in is t ra t ion w o u l d take s teps t o 
imp rove the c l ima te f o r business generally, and fo re ign investment in pa r t icu la r . 
President Ferndndez’s new adm in is t ra t ion i s con f ron ted w i t h fo rm idab le challenges. 
f i r s t task i s t o emerge f r o m the c r is is and restore macroeconomic stability, w h i l e reduc ing the 
f isca l gap, res t ruc tu r ing debt and m o b i l i z i n g new external and domestic f inanc ing . The new 
adm in is t ra t ion intends t o in t roduce re fo rms t o place the D om i n i c a n economy o n a sound f o o t i n g 
and avo id the occurrence o f add i t iona l crises, p r im a r i l y b y strengthening p u b l i c expenditure 
management procedures, enhancing regu la t ion and supervision in the b a n k i n g sector, and 
restoring the f inanc ia l sustainability o f the e lec t r ic i ty sector. 
Increased soc ia l p ro tec t ion and 
imp roved ta rge t ing o f social programs are also a p r i o r i t y o f the Gove rnmen t t o a v o i d fu r the r 
deterioration o f b o t h l i v i n g cond i t ions and the social fab r ic . 
L o o k i n g ahead, the D om i n i c a n economy w i l l face new and large compe t i t ive pressures in 
the f ramewo rk o f imminent trade p o l i c y changes that w i l l make ach iev ing and ma in ta in ing the 
h i g h g row th rates o f the 1990s mo re challenging. Increased trade l ibe ra l iza t ion - in 
the f o r m o f 
the phase-out o f the M u l t i f i b r e Agreement in 2005, the new free trade agreement w i th the U n i t e d 
States and the fo r thcom ing W o r l d Trade Organizations (WTO ) res t r ic t ions o n F ree Trade Zones 
(FTZs) expo r t support po l ic ies -w i l l 
result in greater compe t i t ion f o r D om i n i c a n producers. 
Policies t o imp rove competitiveness w i l l need t o be comp lemen ted by a range o f p u b l i c actions 
t o ensure that poo r people bene f i t . Measures t o reach the objectives o f restored g r ow t h and 
increased trade and competitiveness w h i l e ach iev ing greater soc ia l equ i ty w i l l thus need t o 
complement the on -go ing e f fo r ts t o emerge f r o m the c r is is and restore mac roeconom ic s tab i l i ty . 
Imp lemen t ing v is ib le and far-reaching measures t o im p r o v e governance and strengthen 
ins t i tu t ions across a l l sectors must be at the core o f the Government’s e f fo r ts t o address the 
aforementioned challenges. W h i l e the D om i n i c a n Repub l ic en joyed a b o om i n g p r iva te sector in 
the 1990s, state mode rn iza t ion was kep t o n the back burner, and this has created a serious 
disconnect between the structure, methods, and capacities o f the p u b l i c sector and the demands 
o f a mode rn economy. The impo r tance o f adequate and transparent lega l and regu la to ry 
f ramewo rks has been w e l l demonstrated b y the crises in the f inanc ia l and e lec t r ic i ty sectors. 
A lso , efforts t o mode rn ize the p u b l i c sector b y reduc ing excessive cen t ra l iza t ion , r e f o rm i n g the

Addressing these challenges w i l l requ i re strong and sustained c omm i tm e n t o n the pa r t o f

Political Context

7. 
In a vote that re f lec ted widespread popu la r f rus t ra t ion over the worst economic crisis t o h i t 
the coun t ry in decades, Dom in icans went t o the p o l l s in M a y 2004 and elected in the first r o u n d 
Leone1 Fe rn indez , a fo rme r president and leader o f the oppos i t ion D om i n i c a n L i b e r a t i o n Pa r ty 
(PLD), t o replace incumben t President H i p 6 l i t o M e j i a o f the r u l i n g D om i n i c a n Revo lu t iona ry 
Party (PRD).’ W h i l e the successful t rans i t ion o f leadership was w i d e l y recogn ized as a sign o f 
the g r ow i n g strength o f democracy in the country, President Fe rn indez ’s v i c t o r y emerged in a 
con tex t o f t u rm o i l w i t h i n the coun t ry ’s m a i n p o l i t i c a l parties caused by the death o f t h e i r 
respective h is to r ica l leaders and the subsequent powe r struggles f o r succession.2 Within the 
PLD, Fernandez had emerged as the party’s leader. The PRD and the PRSC are d i v i d e d among 
factions pulling in d i f fe ren t directions. 
The coun t ry ’s p o l i t i c a l system i s characterized by a h i g h l y cen t ra l ized p res iden t ia l reg ime 
w i t h l i m i t e d checks and balances and weak ins t i tu t ions that leave r o o m f o r the abuse o f powe r . 
The cu l tu re o f patronage has p ro found ly shaped D om i n i c a n p u b l i c ins t i tu t ions and adm in is t ra t ive 
practices. As a result, c i v i l service practices favo r c l ien te l ism over p ro fess iona l qua l i f ica t ions 
and have resu l ted in an ine f f ic ien t p u b l i c administration, high tu rnove r in mos t p u b l i c sector j o b s 
and l im i t e d ins t i tu t iona l con t inu i ty . 
9 . 
The p u b l i c adm in is t ra t ion i s highly centralized; opaque accoun t ing and p u b l i c expenditure 
practices and state capture b y vested interests characterize p u b l i c sector management. 
particular, the use o f p u b l i c contracts t o rewa rd p o l i t i c a l a l l ies and f inanc ia l con t r ibu to rs has

IMF and passed by Congress in October 2004; this i s expected to y i e l d mo re than 2 percent o f

RD$30/US$1 in Novembe r 2004 and has since then rema ined stable between RD$28 and RD$30

A l t h o u g h the authorities missed the October lSt deadline t o achieve comparable treatment, the 
Paris Club has expressed a w i l l ingness t o ex tend the deadline and app ly the compa rab i l i ty

This p rog ram aims at conso l ida t ing the recent progress in economic po l ic ies b y the new

A l though the bank ing system i s cu r ren t ly in a stable s i tua t ion

rema in a concern. 
In te rna t iona l ly assisted inspections o f banks, f ina l ized and presented t o the 
authorities in spring 2004, did no t i d e n t i f y new cases o f bank fraud. Howeve r , an impo r tan t 
cap i ta l gap was identified in terms o f l o c a l standards, even higher in terms o f in te rna t iona l 
standards, re f lec t ing a worsening loan p o r t f o l i o and lack o f loan loss p rov is ions . The authorities 
have taken ac t ion t o address some o f these weaknesses. A monetary and f inanc ia l l a w (LMF, 
L a w No . 183-02) was approved in 2002 and e f fo r ts t o imp rove the b a n k i n g regu la t ion and

bank ing regu la t ion and supervision closer t o in te rna t iona l standards and practices. The f inanc ia l 
authorities have in i t ia ted some urgent re fo rms in the sector but the necessary med ium - te rm 
re fo rms are s t i l l pending. 
20. T h e E lectr ic ity Sector. The e lec t r ic i ty sector continues t o be a f fec ted b y a ma jo r crisis, as 
r o l l i n g b lackou ts disrupt e lec t r ic i ty service t o domestic, indus t r ia l and comme rc ia l consumers. 
The sector has a consolidated debt o f over US$500 m i l l i o n and was l o s i n g about US $ 4 0 m i l l i o n 
per m o n t h in late-2004.5 The peso depreciation and the high pe t ro leum p r ices b rough t the sector

rates. The sector i s characterized b y a v ic ious c i rc le o f a consumer cu l tu re o f non-payment, 
inadequate cash f l ow , debt escalation, poo r r e l i a b i l i t y o f powe r supply, and consumer 
dissatisfaction. Im p r o v i n g the f inanc ia l sustainability o f the e lec t r ic i ty sector w i l l be c r i t i c a l f o r

better manage the ra t ion ing o f p ow e r supply. Howeve r , even w i t h these measures, whose 
imp lemen ta t ion w i l l requ i re strong and sustained Gove rnmen t comm i tmen t , the resu l t ing powe r 
sector d e f i c i t i s expected t o rema in s ign i f ican t , po ten t ia l ly as high as $25 t o $30 m i l l i o n per

sustainable de f ic i t leve l . 
21. T rade and Competitiveness. L o o k i n g ahead, the D om i n i c a n economy w i l l face s ign i f ican t 
new compe t i t ive pressures in the con tex t o f imm i n e n t trade p o l i c y changes that w i l l make 
ach iev ing and ma in ta in ing the high g r ow t h rates o f the 1990s m o r e cha l leng ing . Increased trade 
l ibe ra l iza t ion w i l l occur progressively in con junc t ion w i t h the phase-out o f the M u l t i f i b r e 
Agreement (since January 2005), the new f ree trade agreement w i t h the U S (DR -C A F T A ) and 
the fo r thcom ing W T O requirement t o adjust the f ree trade zone (FTZ) tax reg ime t o e l im ina te 
e f fec t ive expo r t subsidies b y 2010. The M u l t i f i b r e Ag reemen t phase-out m a y resu l t in a ma jo r 
con t rac t ion in FTZ apparel exports, a l though the D R - C A F T A i s expected t o cush ion the impac t 
b y s t imu la t ing trade, investment and emp loymen t . The f isca l impac t o f D R - C A F T A m a y be

l im i t e d short-term impac t o n ag r icu l tu ra l trade volumes and prices, g iven that D om i n i c a n 
agriculture expo r ts already have preferential access t o the U n i t e d States. Price d is to r t ions 
created b y high im p o r t ta r i f fs t o selected crops, such as rice, w i l l decrease in the medium and 
l o n g term, a l though they w i l l no t disappear. But the new incen t ive structure w i l l l i k e l y induce a 
shift f r o m r ice c u l t i v a t i o n t o h ighe r value-added products in the m e d i um term, such as t rop ica l 
fruits. 
The mining sector c o u l d po ten t ia l ly also con t r ibu te t o economic g r ow t h and 
d ive rs i f ica t ion o f D om i n i c a n exports. So far, however, the development o f this sector has been 
constrained b y i s s u e s o f transparency, poo r governance, and h a rm f u l env i ronmen ta l practices. 
22. Environment and Tourism. In order t o ma in ta in competitiveness in the tou r ism sector, 
add i t iona l e f fo r ts t o imp rove env i ronmen ta l management w i l l be essential as emphasized in the 
Bank ’s Coun t ry Env i ronmen t Assessment (FY04 ) . The m a i n env i ronmen ta l i s s u e s relate t o 
water management (water qua l i ty , water scarcity and water resources management), so l id waste 
co l lec t ion and disposal. M o s t water qua l i ty p rob lems are generated by the lack o f adequate 
u rban wastewater co l lec t ion , treatment and disposal, and ag r icu l tu ra l r u n - o f f causing qua l i ty 
problems downs t ream and in coastal waters ( inc lud ing beaches frequented by tourists). 
Inadequate management o f water demand (ma in ly in agriculture) and high unaccounted f o r water 
consump t ion in u rban areas generate water scarcity. The newe r t o u r i sm developments are 
situated in zones where water i s generally scarce and the u rban sp raw l accompanying these 
developments creates add i t iona l demands o n aquifers. At a minimum, tou r ism and u rban 
p lann ing as w e l l as incen t ives and encouragements t o save water w i l l b e needed t o ensure 
sustainability o f these tou r ism developments. S o l i d waste management (co l lec t ion and disposal) 
w o u l d make i t mo re attractive f o r tourists t o t rave l in the coun t ry and w o u l d vastly imp rove the 
hea l th o f popu la t ions l i v i n g close t o land f i l ls and the qua l i ty o f the env i ronmen t . Env i ronmen ta l 
management i s also c r i t i c a l f o r suppression o f pest species (e.g., mosqu i tos w h i c h carry ma la r ia 
and Dengue fever). The adequate management o f the protected areas in association w i t h c i v i l 
society and the p r iva te sector w o u l d help t o d ive rs i fy the coun t ry ’s t o u r i sm b rand and a l l ow l o c a l 
commun i t ies t o bene f i t mo re f r o m the sector. In addition, strengthening capacity f o r disaster 
preparedness and response w o u l d m i t iga te the negative impac ts o f na tu ra l hazards, pa r t icu la r ly in 
the tou r ism and ag r icu l tu ra l sectors. 
23. Scenarios for Fu tu re G row th . The new external env i ronmen t brings new opportunities as

scenar io , rea l GDP g r ow t h i s expected t o reach 2.5 percent in 2005 and re tu rn to mo re robust

anticipated f isca l re fo rms , and then f a l l thereafter

balance-which was nea r ly 6 percent o f GDP in 2004-is 
expected t o dec l ine t o 2 percent o f 
GDP in 2005 and t o nea r ly zero in 2006 as a resu l t o f a p i c k - u p in impo r ts . E v e n w i t h the 
envisaged f isca l adjustment, the base case scenario s t i l l generates a f inanc ing gap in 2005 and 
2006 due t o debt-servicing ob l iga t ions ; this i s expected t o be f i l l e d th rough a comb ina t ion o f

In addition, p r o v i s i o n o f soc ia l services i s over-centralized and

I n addition, the e lec t r ic i ty sector c r is is had serious social 
repercussions, w i t h e lec t r ic i ty b lackou ts resu l t ing in increased c r ime and violence and

reforms in the area o f pub l ic sector mode rn iza t ion that touch o n pub l ic f inanc ia l management 
and procurement. Howeve r , resu l ts t o date are l im i t e d and c o u l d easily be reversed o r

111. T h e Government ’s P rog ram 

46. T h e PLD presented i t s P lan f o r the pe r iod o f 2004-2008 during the electoral campaign. 
The p rog ram i s b road and ambitious; nevertheless, i t c lea r ly sets ou t f o u r p r i o r i t y themes o r f o c a l 
areas. Since tak ing powe r , the Gove rnmen t has updated this p l a n and i s cu r ren t ly defining i t s 
po l ic ies in these fou r areas: 

Th em e 1: Restore Mac roeconom ic S tab i l i ty to Reengage in G row th . This theme i s 

sometimes referred t o as “mode rn iza t ion o f the economy.” 
I t emphasizes fou r k e y aspects: 
economic policy, f isca l po l icy , pub l ic debt management, and pub l ic expenditure 
management. 

Th em e 2: 

Consolidate Democ ra t ic Gove rnance b y S t reng then ing K e y Public 

Inst itut ions . This theme, sometimes re fe r red t o as “more and better democracy,” iden t i f ies 
re fo rms in s ix k e y areas: Po l i t ica l Reform, Reform of 
the Pub l ic Administration, Reform of 
the Executive Power, Reform of 
the Legislative Power, Reform of 
the Judiciary, and 
Mun ic ipa l Reform. The Gove rnmen t p rog ram emphasizes the impo r tance o f strengthening 
p u b l i c ins t i tu t ions and making processes m o r e transparent i n c l u d i n g the procurement and 
f inanc ia l management systems. 

Th em e 3: Engende r a g rea te r leve l o f social a n d t e r r i to r i a l cohesion in Dom in ican 

society. This theme focuses p r im a r i l y o n soc ia l po l ic ies but inc ludes also env i ronmen ta l 
po l ic ies and land-use p lann ing . The Gove rnmen t proposes t o h a l t the increase in pove r ty 
and the deterioration in human deve lopmen t cond i t ions o f the people; p romo te po l ic ies t o 
reduce the levels o f inequa l i ty in the d is t r ibu t ion o f wealth; ensure e f f ic iency and ta rge t ing 
in social pub l ic expenditures; p romo te gender equality; and pursue phys ica l p lann ing 
po l ic ies that are env i ronmen ta l ly sustainable. 

Theme 4: 

Im p r o v e the competitiveness o f the Dom in ican economy. This area i s 

sometimes referred t o as “na t iona l and in te rna t iona l convergence.” 
I t emphasizes three 
c r i t ica l p o l i c y areas: In te rna t iona l Trade, Free Trade Zones, and Tourism w i t h i n a 
f ramewo rk o f env i ronmen ta l sus ta inab i l i ty .

this ove ra l l program, 
the Government has g iven p r i o r i t y

debt restructuring, recap i ta l iza t ion o f banks, strengthened ins t i tu t iona l capacity o f the monetary 
authorities t o imp rove the design and imp lemen ta t ion o f mone ta ry policies, and stronger 
f inanc ia l sector oversight and regulation. A l s o as a p r io r i ty , the government intends t o reduce 
the e lec t r ic i ty sector d e f i c i t through various measures. 
I t intends t o imp lemen t measures t o 
restore g r ow t h and increase trade and competitiveness. Res to r ing sound macroeconomic 
management and strengthening the f inanc ia l and e lec t r ic i ty sectors w i l l be pre-requisites in this 
respect. 
48. Add i t iona l ly , the Fe rn indez administration has launched an amb i t ious soc ia l agenda, w h i c h 
builds o n re fo rms supported b y the IDB and W o r l d Bank ’s social sector loans. This agenda 
includes im p r o v e d targeting o f social programs th rough the use o f an updated Pove r ty M a p 
(based o n the 2002 census and r e l y i n g o n unsatisfied basic needs) and household-level surveys, 
enab l ing the development o f a u n i f i e d system f o r bene f ic ia ry selection. 
I t also includes the 
expansion o f cond i t iona l cash transfer programs, “Come r es P r im e r o ” f o r those l i v i n g in 
extreme poverty,” and the “T a r j e t a de Asistencia Esco la r ” f o r poo r fam i l ies w h o send the i r 
ch i ld ren t o p r ima ry school. Recogn iz ing that the crisis has set back progress o n many o f the 
M i l l e n n i u m Deve lopmen t Goa l (MDG) indicators, President Fe rn indez has established a Soc ia l 
Cabinet t o spearhead soc ia l sector re fo rms and se t up a Presidential Comm iss ion f o r the 
Achievement o f the MDGs and Sustainable Development. A k e y task o f the Comm iss ion i s t o 
catalyze the inco rpo ra t ion o f the MDGs in a l l government programs as w e l l as t o m o n i t o r

IV . Progress o n th e C u r r e n t Bank G r o u p S t ra tegy 

49. The last full CAS , w h i c h dates back t o 1999, focused on: (i) sustaining economic g row th ; 
(ii) increasing the access o f poo r people t o the bene f i t o f g row th ; (iii) mode rn iz ing the state and 
im p r o v i n g governance; and ( iv ) imp lemen t ing po l ic ies f o r r u r a l and env i ronmen ta l ly sustainable 
development. Up u n t i l the incep t ion o f the 2003 crisis, Gove rnmen t advanced in several o f these 
areas. Progress o n the larger reforms, however, was l im i t e d . L i m i t e d advances were also made 
in mode rn iz ing the State and im p r o v i n g governance, especially putting in p lace appropriate lega l 
and regulatory f ramewo rks and the ins t i tu t iona l capacity requ i red t o p romo te p r iva te sector 
competition. During the 1999 CAS period, the B a n k app roved U S 1 1 8 m i l l i o n o f new 
commitments.*’ Considerable progress was made in p ro jec t imp lemen ta t ion ; and, p r i o r t o the 
2003 bank ing and e lec t r ic i ty crisis, the ove ra l l mac ro pe r fo rmance was b road ly pos i t ive (See 
Annex A3 ) . 
50. A 2003 OED C o u n t r y Assistance Eva lua t ion f o r the p e r i o d 1985-2002 conc luded that the 
Bank’s invo lvemen t and effectiveness have varied, rang ing f r o m in tens ive and e f fec t ive in the 
ea r ly 1990s t o l im i t e d in m id -1990s and f i n a l l y t o m o r e ac t ive invo lvemen t w i t h increasing 
effectiveness recently. T h e OED recommended that the Bank : (i) con t inue t o imp rove the 

l 9 Comer es P r im e r o (Ea t ing Comes First), o r ig ina l ly limited to 6,000 families, w i l l be extended to 250,000 in the 
nex t years. I t imp l ies the d is t r ibu t ion o f deb i t cards w i t h a balance o f RD$500 (about US$16) per mon th available to

structural r e f o rm agenda to inc lude agriculture and the remova l o f barriers t o entry and 
compe t i t ion ; and ( iv ) support the r e f o rm o f the powe r sector. 
51. A CAS Progress Report was discussed b y the B o a r d o f D i rec to rs o n Feb rua ry 12, 2004. 
The C A S Progress Report, wh ich covers a pe r iod o f F Y 0 4 t o FY05 , was designed t o support the 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the government economic s tab i l iza t ion program, in close coo rd ina t ion w i th 
the IMF and IDB. I t s m a i n objective was t o support interventions to: (i) p ro tec t social programs 
and human cap i ta l during the economic crisis w h i l e p r o v i d i n g impe tus t o impo r tan t social sector 
reforms; (ii) support renewed economic ac t iv i ty and sustained g row th ; and (iii) deepen the B a n k 
G roup ’s ana ly t ica l know ledge and dialogue w i t h the Government o n issues related t o new and 
emerging challenges (See Annex A4 ) . 
52. The CAS Progress Repo r t had three lend ing scenarios: l ow , base, and high case. The base 
case lending scenario inc luded three operations f o r a to ta l o f US $ 1 2 0 m i l l i o n ( o f w h i c h US$ lOO 
m i l l i o n f o r adjustment lending).2’ The high case lend ing scenario has an add i t iona l U S $ l 5 0 
m i l l i o n in comm i tmen ts ( fo r a Powe r Sector R e f o rm S A L ) bringing the to ta l lend ing envelope t o 
US$270 m i l l i o n . In add i t ion t o a satisfactory macro-economic f ramewo rk , the triggers f o r the 
high case l e n d i n g scenario were i d e n t i f i e d as a satisfactory na t iona l pact on the fu tu re legal, 
regu la to ry and p o l i c y f ramewo rk f o r a sustainable e lec t r ic i ty sector in the m e d i um te rm , and a 
binding and v iab le agreement between the government and p r iva te operators t o settle a r r e a r s in 
the e lec t r ic i ty sector. 
53 . The base case lend ing was fu l ly comm i t ted at the t ime o f the Board’s discussion o f the 
C A S Progress Repo r t . Since then, s ign i f ican t progress in the energy sector has t r igge red the 
preparation o f the Powe r Sector R e f o rm SAL, w h i c h was recen t ly submitted t o the Boa rd . 
54. At present, the W o r l d B a n k p o r t f o l i o in the D om i n i c a n Repub l ic consists o f n ine loans (one 
adjustment, s ix investment, and t w o technical assistance loans) f o r an ove ra l l lend ing envelope 
o f US$238 m i l l i o n , ou t o f w h i c h US$138 m i l l i o n rema in undisbursed. T w o o f the projects in the 
p o r t f o l i o are cu r ren t ly awa i t ing Congressional ra t i f ica t ion : 
the F inanc ia l Sector TA (US$12.5 
m i l l i o n ) and the Powe r Sector TA (US$7.3 m i l l i o n ) . I t i s expected that Congress w o u l d approve 
the t w o loans in the f i r s t h a l f o f 2005. B y the t im e this C A S w i l l b e presented t o the B o a r d (M a y 
2005), one o f the seven projects cu r ren t ly unde r execu t ion w i l l have closed. Three add i t iona l 
projects w i l l have c losed by December 2005. T h e development impac t o f the IBRD p o r t f o l i o 
during the c om i n g f o u r years w i l l be heav i ly in f luenced by the f i v e rema in ing projects (see 
Annex C). 
55 . The ove ra l l performance o f the B a n k p o r t f o l i o in the D om i n i c a n Repub l ic i s cu r ren t ly 
be low past standards. A f t e r years above reg iona l averages, since F Y 0 4 and the onset o f the 
economic crisis, the D om i n i c a n po r t fo l io ’s disbursement ra t io f e l l w e l l b e l ow the L A C reg iona l

2 1 Soc ia l Crisis Response Adjustment Loan-SCRAL 
( U S $ l O O million), and Power and Financial Sec tor Technical 
Assistance loans (US$7.3 and 12.5 million respectively).

performance o f the po r t fo l io . 
56. N e t f inanc ia l f l ow s calculated o n b o t h adjustment and investment loans f o r the past s ix FYs 
have been positive.24 Howeve r , since FY03, net f inanc ia l f l ow s produced by investment loans 
on ly have decreased and become negative in FY03 and FY05 , thus c o n f i rm i n g the existence o f 
systemic issues hav ing a de t r imen ta l impac t o n disbursement performance. There are f o u r m a i n 
causes o f s low disbursements: (i) extensive delays in the Congressional ra t i f ica t ion o f p ro jec ts 
exacerbated b y the fact that 2004 was an e lec t ion year; (ii) inadequate and u n t im e l y a l loca t ion o f 
counterpart funds; (iii) s low f l o w o f funds, due t o cumbersome procedures f o r the disbursement 
o f ex te rna l funds deposited in the projects’ special accounts w i t h the Cen t ra l Bank; and ( iv ) 
ins t i tu t iona l weakness o f p ro jec t imp lemen ta t ion units, w h i c h are f requen t ly reshuffled, thus 
affecting the projects’ management capacity. The B a n k i s w o r k i n g w i t h the authorities t o 
address these issues. 
57. Three o f n ine current loans are single currency. F o r i t s new IBRD loans, the D om i n i c a n 
Repub l ic has m o v e d t o the F i x e d Spread L o a n (FSL) but has n o t taken advantage o f the 
embedded risk management tools inc luded in the F S L s that the Gove rnmen t c o u l d use t o manage 
the currency, interest rate and r o l l o v e r r i s k s . 2 5 Furthermore, the D om i n i c a n Repub l ic might wan t 
t o consider s ign ing a Mas te r De r iva t ives Agreement (MDA) w i t h IBRD. The MDA w o u l d 
p rov ide access t o a range o f IBRD risk management products (e.g., currency swaps, i n t e r e s t rate,

BOX 2: IFC’S PROJECTS FROM FY2000 TO MARCH 2005 

I n the hea lthcare sector, the Hospiten Clinica BBvaro project (US$4.0 million loan) i n Punta Cana provides 
access to healthcare se rv ices to the l o c a l population in the region and c r i t i c a l soc ia l infrastructure to the tourism 
industry. I n FY03, as part o f a US$20 million regional investment for Hospiten, IFC supported the remodeling 
and upgrading o f a recently acquired hospital i n Santo Doming0 with US$7.3 million. 
I n telecommunications, IFC’s US$IOO million financing to Orange Dominicana (formerly known as “France 
Telecom Dominicana”) i n FY02-03, supports continued private sector participation i n the telecommunications 
sector and complements the Bank’s 1999 Telecommunications Regulatory Reform Project that created the new 
regulator, INDOTEL. 
I n the transport sector, IFC’s US$30 million financing to the Caucedo port project has enhanced private sector 
participation i n maritime infrastructure se rv ices . Another US$60 million loan to Aerodom i s financing the 
renovation and expansion o f existing airport facilities, and the construction o f new ones, supporting the tourism 
industry. 
I n the tour ism sector, IFC’s lending package o f US$70 m i l l ion to Occidental w i l l upgrade hotels and improve 
the sector’s competitiveness. 
I n the agribusiness sector, IFC’s US$15 million financing to Pasteurizadora Rica, the country’s foremost 
agribusiness company i n the processing o f dairy and fruit juice sectors, has directly contributed to raising the 
quality, sanitary, and environmental standards in the industry. 
I n FY03, IFC supported the f inanc ia l sector with financing and technical assistance including a US$20 m i l l ion 
credit line to Banco Hipotecano Dominican0 (BHD), the second largest domestic private bank. 
I n the cement sector, IFC supported a newly formed company, Domicem, with US$48 million long-term 
financing (mobilizing US$24 m i l l ion from foreign commercial banks). 
I n FY04, IFC approved a US$20 m i l l ion loan f o r a free t rade zone p ro jec t sponsored by Grupo M. I t includes 
building an industrial park on H a i t i ’ s side o f the border between the Dominican Republic and H a i t i .

IBRD’s p rog ram in D om i n i c a n Repub l ic was, until recently, re la t ive ly small. I t has 
increased s ign i f ican t ly over the last 18 mon ths w i t h B o a r d app rova l o f three projects (US$120 
m i l l i o n ) and the current preparation o f an energy SAL o f $150 m i l l i o n . There are various 
reasons for this: during the 1990s the economy g rew imp ress ive ly and Gove rnmen t was reluctant 
t o b o r r ow f r o m the Bank , in pa r t because o f wha t i t considered excessive l o a n cond i t iona l i ty and 
oversight. Since 1998, however, the coun t ry dialogue has in tens i f ied , supported b y k e y B a n k 
ana ly t ica l w o r k and the establishment o f a coun t ry o f f ice . Cu r ren t ly , i t i s in the energy sector 
that the Government looks mos t c lose ly t o the B a n k f o r support. Recen t ly the Gove rnmen t has 
also approached the B a n k f o r advice in the many areas re la ted t o im p r o v i n g governance, 
i n c l u d i n g an t i -co r rup t ion and p u b l i c procurement. 
I t i s clear that in b o t h Gove rnmen t and 
broader c i v i l society there i s inc reas ing appreciation f o r the Bank ’s knowledge, technical 
capacity, and g loba l experience. The Gove rnmen t recognizes that B a n k p o l i c y support brings 
better qua l i ty o f p u b l i c spending and that B a n k impac t can reach w e l l beyond i t s spec i f ic loans. 
I t also recognizes that B a n k l e n d i n g can attract and leverage add i t iona l f inanc ia l sources. I t i s 
therefore c r i t ica l that the Bank ’s p rog ram con t inue t o inc lude a b road range o f ana ly t ica l and

(i) stabilize the economy, im p r o v e competitiveness, and resume economic growth; and 
(ii) achieve greater soc ia l equ i ty th rough human deve lopmen t and increased coverage and

B o t h P i l la rs link closely w i t h the Millennium Deve lopmen t Goals (MDGs) as the coun t ry ’s

t o restore macroeconomic stability, imp rove the competitiveness o f the D om i n i c a n economy and

Imp rovemen ts in governance and strengthening ins t i tu t ions cut across these t w o pillars and

BOX 3: FINANCIAL, PROCUREMENT AND HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ISSUES 

F inanc ia l , procurement, and human resource management reforms are h i g h p r io r i t ies f o r res tor ing macroeconomic 
s tab i l i ty and lay ing the groundwork f o r further pub l ic sector modernization. 
The key instrument o f f inanc ia l managemen t re fo rm has been an integrated system (SIGEF), w h i c h now captures 
budget fo rmu la t ion and disbursements fo r the central government agencies. A l though S IGEF records 
commitments, i t does not capture actual expenditures-so 
that there i s no way o f t e l l i n g whether disbursed funds 
have been used to pay outstanding comm i tmen ts or d iver ted to some other purpose. The revenue, accounting, and 
repor t ing modules o f S IGEF are l e s s developed; mon i to r ing pub l ic debt i s through a separate and s t i l l incomplete 
system (S IGADE ) ; and the procurement modu le i s currently under design. A d d i n g the m iss ing modules, 
designating a cen tra l and m in is ter ia l o f f ice to manage and ma in ta in the system, imp rov ing the qua l i ty o f 
budgetary fo rmu la t ion b y l i n k i n g expenditures to programs and objectives, and m o v i n g toward p lur i-annua l 
p lann ing are obvious next steps. Further c r i t ica l measures, wh ich S IGEF alone cannot accomplish, are the 
e l im ina t ion o f a cumbersome se r ies o f ex-ante controls and a reassignment o f func t ions and responsib 
among the various offices i n v o l v e d in the f inanc ia l management process. This w i l l mean, inter a l ia , reduc ing the 
roles p layed b y the O f f ice of the Budge t and the Con tra lor ia (internal control), possible movement o f the latter 
out o f the O f f i c e o f the President and in to the M i n i s t r y o f Finance, and strengthening the operations o f the

need to better con t ro l the debt o f the l i n e m in is tr ies and decentralized agencies. 
The c r i t ica l issues in the area o f p u b l i c sector p rocu remen t inc lude an obsolete and inconsistent regulatory 
framework , non-enforcement o f ex is t ing ru les and lack o f an e f fec t ive p o l i c y generation and oversight func t ion . 
These problems are compounded b y the s ign i f ican t systemic weakness i n budget, con tro ls and human resource 
management. Am o n g the ma in consequences are ind iscr im ina te use o f d irec t contracting, general lack of 
accountability, ine f f ic ien t use o f pub l ic resources, and widespread perception o f the procurement system as non- 
transparent. The absence o f a comprehensive procurement re fo rm strategy consistent w i t h the broader objectives 
o f state modernization and the coun try ’s p o l i t i c a l economy contributed to the l a c k o f success o f various previous 
attempts to improve the system’s efficiency and transparency. This strategy should inc lude a sustained long- term 
e f fo r t to b u i l d po l i t ica l support for the adop t ion o f a modern procurement law , med ium - te rm actions such as 
establishing a procurement p o l i c y u n i t w i t h adequate resources, a c l e a r mandate, and an e f fec t ive bid protest 
system, as w e l l as short-term actions that are easy to imp lemen t and l i k e l y to resu l t in qu ick gains. The latter 
inc lude a br idge decree consistent w i t h in terna t iona l standards, an e-procurement strategy to be implemented i n 
steps and focus ing i n i t i a l l y o n e-transparency, a more e f f ic ien t government supp ly strategy, standard b idd ing 
documents and guidelines, a procurement m o n i t o r i n g and evaluation system, strengthened in terna l control, 
procurement p lann ing and contract adm in is tra t ion system, and a comprehensive capacity b u i l d i n g plan. The 
capacity b u i l d i n g p lan should address pub l ic employee attitudes and government service cu l ture as we l l as 
strengthen procurement management s k i l l s . 
Human resource management, wh i le c r i t i c a l to the e f f ic ien t operation o f any organ iza t ion and a clear 
imped imen t to improved pub l ic sector per formance in the Dom in ican Repub l ic , remains a daun t ing task. The 
government’s proposal to create an a l l - inc lus ive c i v i l service w i t h i n e igh t years seems b o t h excessively op t im is t ic 
and poss ib ly ill-advised, g iven the absence o f i n f o rm a t i o n on quantitative and qua l i ta t ive needs fo r v i r tua l ly a l l 
organizations, possible changes in these requirements as the ir missions shift, the t rad i t iona l and nearly universal 
reliance on patronage appointments, and the l a c k o f objective instruments fo r ve t t ing candidates fo r either present 
needs or those o f an unknown near future. A mo re rea l is t ic f i r s t step w o u l d be the crea t ion o f a l i v e reg is try o f a l l 
current employees, whatever the ir contractual status, so that the government at least knows who i t i s pay ing for 
do ing what, can iden t i fy obv ious abuses, and can beg in to enforce ex is t ing regu la t ions as regards ind iv idua l 
appointments and changes i n agency s ta f f ing patterns. A second step w o u l d be t o advance the regu lar iza t ion of 
personnel status w i th in core func t iona l areas-budgeting, 
con tro l , accounting, and procurement, leav ing time to 
consider whether a career service i s desirable f o r the r e s t o f the pub l ic employees. The fact that 97 percent of 
current employees lack j o b tenure should be seen as an advantage and p r o v i d i n g f l e x i b i l i t y , o f fe r ing ample 
oppor tun i ty for adjusting s ta f f ing patterns to rea l needs.

basic services respectively). These indicators are n o t meant t o m o n i t o r the longe r - te rm 
ove ra rch ing goals o f economic and social development and pove r ty reduc t ion . F o r example, the 
intermediate ind ica to rs o f steady ‘improvements in the energy sector cash recovery index ’ and 
‘ t ime ly paymen t b y Government o f i t s mon th ly energy b i l l ’ w i l l con t r ibu te t o stabilize the

The understanding he re i s that this w i l l reduce inequa l i ty and pove r ty . 
117. Some o f the lending instruments w i l l affect mo re than one outcome but have o n l y been

management o f so l id waste w i l l pos i t ive ly impac t b o t h the t o u r i sm sector, i.e., competitiveness 
and economic growth, and the environment and hea l th o f su r round ing commun i t ies . Similarly,

120. ZBRD Exposure. IBRD exposure and risk ind ica to rs w i l l increase ove r the C A S pe r iod 
(see Tab le 8). Whereas to ta l ex te rna l debt has increased sha rp ly f r o m 19 percent o f GDP in 2000

p u b l i c debt almost doub led f r o m 1 percent o f GDP in 2000-2002 t o nea r ly 2 percent in 2003, 
IBRD interest remained constant. A l t h o u g h this C A S p rog ram has a smaller annual envelope 
than the 1999 C A S and the C A S Progress Report, the Bank ’s exposure in the D om i n i c a n 
Repub l ic i s p ro jec ted t o reach US $ 5 4 2 m i l l i o n in 2006 and US $ 7 2 6 m i l l i o n by 2009 (under the

Country Financing Parameters 
126. The C o u n t r y F inanc ing Parameters f o r the D om i n i c a n Repub l ic have been discussed w i t h 
the Government, who has we lcomed the increased f l e x i b i l i t y (see Annex D). Government 
resources (taxes, revenues and domestic bo r row ing ) represent about two - th i rds o f the t o t a l 
budget and about a third o f the development budget. The Bank ’s base case scenario f o r the 
pe r iod 2006-2009 represents lend ing o f up t o US$65 m i l l i o n a year, o r less than 0.5 percent o f 
GDP and 1.5 percent o f i t s to ta l budget. Bank ’s investment f inanc ing accounts f o r a mere 4 
percent o f the D om i n i c a n Repub l ic ’s cap i ta l budget. As h igh l igh ted b y the recen t ly comp le ted 
PER and CFAA -CPAR , the D om i n i c a n Repub l ic has a re la t ive ly we l l -deve loped system o f 
budget fo rmu la t ion , i n c l u d i n g some mo re sophisticated features that are n o t generally f o u n d in 
the pub l ic expenditure systems o f m idd le - income countries. Howeve r , i t lacks some o f the 
substantive aspects o f budget preparation and imp lemen ta t ion that w o u l d h e l p i n f o r m p o l i c y - 
makers, support better p o l i c y choices and increase the effectiveness o f p u b l i c spending. B a n k - 
financed inves tmen t p ro jec ts a re integrated i n t o the na t iona l budget. 
T rad i t iona l ly , the 
Dom in ican budget authorities earmarked resources t o projects in the yea r ly na t iona l budgets, 
either d i rec t ly o r as part o f the budgets o f the corresponding l i n e m in is t r ies . Howeve r , this has 
n o t guaranteed that funds be disbursed in full o r o n a t im e l y basis. Indeed, projects have o f ten 
suffered f r om inadequate and u n t im e l y a l loca t ion o f counterpart funds, as resources in the 
budget, b y d e f i n i t i o n fungible, were d ive r ted t o alternative uses. With the 2005 budget, the 
Dom in ican authorities made a considerable e f f o r t t o guarantee that adequate counterpart funds b e 
allocated and disbursed t o development projects f inanced b y mu l t i la te ra l institutions. 
addition, 
the current adm in is t ra t ion has been advancing steadily at mode rn iz ing budget 
procedures w i t h the ob jec t ive o f m o v i n g towards a r e s u l t s and e f f ic iency -based budget process 
as early as 2006. This i s a good s t a r t . Howeve r , the r e f o rm process needs fu r the r strengthening; 
this, in turn, w o u l d reduce u n t im e l y and inadequate disbursements o f counterpart funds and 
d ive rs ion o f funds t o alternative uses. 
In this respect, building o n the conclusions and 
recommendations o f the PER and C F A A -C P AR , the W o r l d B a n k and the IDB w i l l increase their 
active co l labo ra t ion w i t h the gove rnmen ta l authorities b y stepping up their e f fo r ts t o modernize 
the D om i n i c a n f iduc ia ry sector, w i t h a pa r t icu la r emphasis o n the preparation, imp lemen ta t ion 
and m o n i t o r i n g o f p u b l i c expenditures as captured in the yearly na t iona l budget (see paragraphs 
45 ’46 , 82). 
127. Cost sharing. Until now , the B a n k ’ s aggregate f inanc ing share f o r inves tmen t projects in 
the D om i n i c a n Repub l ic c o u l d n o t exceed 6 0 percent, app l ied o n a r o l l i n g three-year basis. In 
the upcom ing C A S period, the Gove rnmen t and the B a n k have agreed o n the limit o f the Bank ’s 
financing share as 9 0 percent o f p ro jec t costs, and i t i s expected that the B a n k s average 
financing share w i l l increase f r o m p rev ious leve ls . This increase in the average cost share i s 

I n

m a i n l y j u s t i f i e d b y the need to support the country’s e f fo r ts t o emerge f r o m the crises, as w e l l as 
t o reflect a l a c k o f counterpart ava i lab i l i ty due to constrained budgets in the near term. B o r r ow e r 
comm i tmen t and owne rsh ip o f activities financed b y the B a n k w o u l d con t inue t o be a cen t ra l 
aspect o f the Bank ’s p rog ram w i t h the country. Experience t o date across the p o r t f o l i o indicates 
that the size o f the counterpart share o f investment projects has no t in f luenced government’s 
owne rsh ip and comm i tmen t . Nonetheless, g iven rema in ing current i s s u e s related t o budge t 
re fo rm , the Gove rnmen t expects t o contribute a minimum o f 10 percent o f p ro jec t costs until 
these issues are adequately addressed. As budget mechanisms imp rove and a track reco rd o f 
adequate and t im e l y a l loca t ion o f counterpart funds i s established, the limit o n the Bank ’s 
f inanc ing share m a y be increased t o 100 percent o f to ta l p ro jec t costs t o p rov ide add i t iona l 
f lex ib i l i ty 
t o the Government. As discussed above (paragraph 109), satisfactory p o r t f o l i o 
performance i s one o f the triggers f o r the base case B a n k lend ing program. Compared t o the 
p rev ious CAS , the to ta l envelope f o r investment projects proposed f o r the pe r iod 2006-2009 i s 
l ow e r and inc ludes fewe r projects o f smaller amount. This w o u l d a l l ow f o r a h ighe r share o f 
B a n k f inanc ing . At the p ro jec t level, Bank ’s f inanc ing share i s expected t o be up t o 9 0 percent in 
the social sectors (health, education, social protection), g iven the need t o preserve k e y soc ia l 
expenditures in the na t iona l budget, as they are o f ten neglected o r reduced t o the minimum, 
pa r t icu la r ly in pe r iod o f economic crisis. Conversely, Bank ’s f inanc ing share i s expected t o b e 
l ow e r in in f ras t ruc tu re projects. The increased f l e x i b i l i t y w i l l better support the Gove rnmen t in 
imp lemen t ing the coun t ry ’s development agenda. Increased f l e x i b i l i t y w i l l also remove several 
imp lemen ta t ion constraints throughout the projects’ l i f e cycles, as the Government and the B a n k 
w o u l d determine the mos t appropriate cost sharing ra t ios f o r projects. This w o u l d also a l l ow f o r 
mo re efficient p ro jec t administration. Indeed, w i t h the phas ing ou t o f the t rad i t iona l par i passu 
approach, cost sharing needs w i l l no t be determined at the l e v e l o f i n d i v i d u a l expenditures. 
F ina l ly , th is w o u l d enable p ro jec t teams t o focus mo re o n techn ica l aspects o f projects rather 
than o n f inanc ing categories. 
128. Recurrent Cost Financing. A t present, o n l y a f ew B a n k projects in the D om i n i c a n 
Repub l ic i n v o l v e some recurrent cost financing, rang ing f r o m 1.4 percent t o 16.6 percent o f the 
loan amount. These inc lude costs related t o p ro jec t adm in is t ra t ion (vehicles, fuel, and satellite 
connection), textbooks, and salaries f o r med ica l s ta f f and researchers, etc. G i v e n the nature o f 
projects in the proposed lend ing pipeline, recurrent cost f inanc ing i s expected t o rema in within 
the current range. Recurrent cost f inanc ing w o u l d be done w i t h i n the ove ra l l f ramewo rk o f the 
Government’s prudent f isca l stance, as evidenced b y the S tand -By Arrangement signed w i t h the 
IMF. I t i s also expected that im p r o v e d budget procedures w i l l soon enable the Gove rnmen t t o 
undertake systematic calculations o f the recurrent costs during p ro jec t imp lemen ta t ion pe r iods 
and beyond. In general, the Government has established a good t rack reco rd o f sus ta inab i l i ty and 
in budge t ing adequate funds f o r recurrent costs after B a n k f inanc ing i s exhausted.22 N o coun t ry 
limit o f Bank - f inanc ing f o r recurrent costs i s proposed. In de te rm in ing recurrent cost f inanc ing 
in i n d i v i d u a l projects, the B a n k w o u l d take i n t o cons ide ra t ion sustainability issues at the sector 
and p ro jec t levels. 
129. Local Cost Financing. F o r the f isca l years 02-04, f inanc ing o f l o c a l costs has represented 
67 percent, 66 percent, and 68 percent respec t ive ly o f inves tmen t lending disbursements. T h e 

2 2 The on ly exception i s represented b y the recen t ly closed Ln. 4127 DO - Na t iona l H ighways . I n this par t icu lar 
case, scarcity o f resources, among other things, has made i t d i f f i c u l t f o r the Government, par t icu lar ly in a pe r iod o f 
economic c r i s i s , to guarantee adequate budgetary and ins t i tu t iona l support, b y means o f a road maintenance fund 
and management un i t a imed at ma in ta in ing the new and reconstructed in fras truc ture .

current and proposed po r t fo l ios are concentrated in sectors such as education, health, pub l ic 
adm in is t ra t ion , and basic infrastructure, where l o c a l expenditures represent a la rge share o f 
p ro jec t resources, and in general, b igge r than the share consumed b y fo re ign expenditures. G o i n g 
forward, a similar share o f loca l cost (Le. about two - th i rds o f to ta l inves tmen t lend ing ) i s 
expected. F o r this reason, i t i s recommended that the B a n k finance l o c a l costs. In addition, as the 
coun t ry wo rks t o emerge f r o m the recent crises, domestic resources are c lea r ly insu f f ic ien t t o 
cover the coun t ry ’s annual development budget and t o meet counterpart f inanc ing requirements. 
With an ove ra l l budget f inanc ing gap o f about US$960 m i l l i o n f o r 2005 and 2006 and tight 
l i m i t s f o r spending o n goods and services (although social spending i s p ro jec ted t o increase in 
rea l terms), external funding w i l l be needed t o guarantee the imp lemen ta t ion o f c r i t i c a l programs 
suppo r t ing the country’s developmental agenda. The tw o c r i te r ia f o r B a n k f inanc ing o f l o c a l 
costs are met. Consequently, B a n k f inanc ing o f l o c a l and fo re ign costs in any p ropo r t ion requ i red 
b y i n d i v i d u a l projects i s proposed. 
130. Taxes a n d Du t ies . The D om i n i c a n Repub l ic has a t rad i t ion o f l o w taxes as measured b y 
the r a t i o o f tax revenues t o GDP. In 2004, this ra t io was 14.8 percent. T h e tax system relies 
heav i ly o n ind i rec t taxation. The f o l l ow i n g i s a description o f the m a i n taxes l e v i e d in the 
coun t ry : 
( i ) Revenues from Personal Zncome Taxes represented 1.5 percent o f GDP (10 percent o f 
to ta l tax revenues) in 2004, w i t h f o rm a l sector employees accounting f o r over 9 0 percent. 
T h e rest comes f r o m se l f -emp loyed contributors. There are fou r annual income brackets: 
(i) income up t o and i n c l u d i n g RD$120,000 
i s tax exempt; (ii) income between 
RD$120 ,000 and RD$200,000 (inclusive) i s taxed at a ma rg ina l rate o f 15 percent; (iii) 
income between RD$200,000 and RD$300,000 (inclusive) i s taxed at a ma rg ina l rate o f 
20 percent; and income above RD$300 ,000 i s taxed at a ma rg ina l rate o f 25 percent. 
( i i ) Corporate Zncome Taxes amounted t o 1.6 percent o f GDP (10 percent o f to ta l tax 
revenues) 
in 2004. 
Corporate 
income 
taxes 
inc lude f o u r categories: 
taxes o n 
corporations, taxes o n telephone companies, and t w o re la t ive ly l o w - y i e l d taxes o n casino 
and racetracks. Corporations are subject t o a tax o f 25 percent o n the i r net income . 
( i i i ) Property Tax revenues amounted t o 0.2 percent o f GDP in 2004 (1.6 percent o f to ta l 
tax revenues). Property taxes are l e v i e d o n rea l estate operations, veh ic le registrations, 
inheritance and business registrations. The bulk o f revenues come f r o m taxes o n rea l 
estate transactions, i n c l u d i n g transfer o f p rope r ty , land reg is t ra t ion and house tax. 
( i v ) Value Added Taxes (VAT) o f 16 percent are imposed o n the sale o f products and 
services, but are subject t o a leng thy l i s t o f scheduled exemptions ( o n 382 products) and 
discretionary exonerations. T h e VAT was increased f r o m 12 t o 16 percent in October 
2004 as a consequence o f the f i s c a l adjustments envisaged t o s tab i l ize the coun t ry ’s 
macroeconomic f ramewo rk . In 2004, the VAT yielded 3.9 percent o f GDP. 
( v ) Excise Taxes amounted t o 2.6 percent o f GDP in 2004, a substantial p o r t i o n o f the 
to ta l tax revenues. They app ly t o pa r t icu la r consump t ion goods, p r im a r i l y alcohol, 
tobacco, o i l , cars, and jewe l ry , inter a l ia , and range f r o m 0-80 percent, w i t h rates f o r 
a lcoho l and tobacco f a l l i n g be tween 25 and 5 0 percent. The h ighes t rates app ly t o l u x u r y 
vehicles. Exc ise taxes d o n o t represent a ma te r ia l amount since mos t i t em s that carry 
excise tax are n o t e l ig ib le unde r p ro jec t f inanc ing . 
( v i ) Trade Taxes consist o f im p o r t duties, a f o r e i g n exchange commission, an expo r t tax, 
and a tourist departure tax. T h e y represent an impo r tan t source o f budget revenues, 

4 1 

although the i r we igh t i s expected to decline progressively as a resu l t o f impend ing trade 
l ibe ra l iza t ion . 
Im p o r t duties represen t approximately 2.5 percent o f GDP ( inc lud ing 
revenue f r o m the supplemental 2 percent im p o r t tax that was e l im ina ted on January 1, 
2005). T h e current t a r i f f structure encompasses th ree m a i n categories: f i n a l products 
taxed at an average 14 percent; intermediate goods taxed at an average 7 percent; and r aw 
materials taxed at 6 percent (based o n 2001 data). Some 25 products, ma in ly vehicles, 
have a 4 0 percent ta r i f f . The ove ra l l average weighted t a r i f f was 9.3 percent in 2001. The 
comm iss ion o n fo re ign exchange generated revenues equal t o 1.9 percent o f GD P in 
2004. T h e comm iss ion was raised f r o m 10 t o 13 percent o n January 1, 2005, t o he lp o f f - 
set the anticipated decline in tariff revenue. The comm iss ion i s scheduled to be phased 
ou t in the c om i n g years under the Stand-By Arrangement. The 5 percent f la t tax o n exports 
was e l im ina ted in mid-2004, but generated revenue o f 0.2 percent o f GDP in the first 6 
months o f 2004. The tou r is t departure tax y ie lded another 0.4 percent o f GDP. 
131. The taxes in the D om i n i c a n Repub l ic are applied t o projects at the same rate as the rest o f 
the country. The D om i n i c a n tax system i s generally ine f f ic ien t , ma r red b y high levels o f tax 
evasion and a w i d e array o f tax exemptions and exonerations. As part o f the economic 
s tab i l iza t ion package negotiated w i t h the IMF, the D om i n i c a n Gove rnmen t i s comm i t ted t o a 
carefully sequenced r e f o rm a imed at s im p l i f y i n g the tax system and b roaden ing the tax base, 
w h i c h w i l l strengthen revenues over the medium term. Based o n the analysis o f the coun t ry ’s 
fiscal reg ime and the p r om i s i n g steps made by the Gove rnmen t towa rd mode rn iz ing i t , the B a n k 
may finance a l l taxes and duties associated w i t h i t s projects. At the p ro jec t level, the B a n k w i l l 
consider whether taxes and duties constitute an excessively high share o f p ro jec t expenditures. 

V I I I . Participatory CAS Process 

132. The preparation o f the D om i n i c a n Repub l ic C A S bene f i ted f r o m extensive consultations 
w i t h government o f f ic ia ls , members o f Congress, c i v i l society i n c l u d i n g you th groups, and 
p r iva te sector representatives, as w e l l as w i t h dono r agencies and academia. These consultations 
p rov ided an oppo r tun i ty to: (i) stimulate a debate around the coun t ry ’s challenges and the ro le o f 
the W o r l d B a n k G roup in he lp ing the coun t ry address them; and (ii) create know ledge and

B a n k G roup m iss ion and services. 
133. The consultation process inc luded ad-hoc d issem ina t ion events f o r W o r l d B a n k reports, 
and larger meetings focus ing o n the proposed CAS strategy. As a f i rs t step, the D om i n i c a n 
Repub l ic coun t ry team disseminated a set o f p o l i c y notes that were prepared f o r the new 
administration, pulling together f ind ings and recommendations o f past W o r l d B a n k G roup 
studies and experiences in the D om i n i c a n Repub l ic . This d ia logue con t inued w i t h the 
Encerrona, a h igh - leve l p o l i c y dialogue o n the coun t ry ’s k e y deve lopmen t issues held o n 
October 23, 2004 w i t h the Government, the IDB, the IMF and the W o r l d Bank . At the same

135. T h e consu l ta t ion process h igh l igh ted a consistent and unequ ivoca l support f o r the p roposed

transparency, accoun tab i l i ty , and anti-corruption), and i ts a r t icu la t ion i n t o t w o p i l la rs (See A n n e x

o f the energy sector, w h i l e w o r k i n g t o address the impac t o f the crises o n the poo r and share 
equ i tab ly the benefits o f future g row th . Howeve r , participants f lagged the i r increasing concerns

In th is respect, i t was recommend that the W o r l d B a n k G roup l o o k mo re c lose ly at 
SMEs, t rad i t iona l ly a source o f emp loymen t f o r vulnerable groups, and increase the i n c l u s i o n o f 
members o f these groups in the education sector in order t o better prepare the young f o r labo r - 
market en t ry . The consultations also h igh l igh ted the importance o f w o r k i n g w i t h l o c a l 
governments and mun ic ipa l i t ies and strengthen the i r capacity t o serve e f fec t ive ly and e f f i c i e n t l y 
the i r constituents. Based o n the participants’ unan imous request t o be consulted u p - f r o n t and 
i n v o l v e d in mon i to r ing , f o l l ow - u p consultations w i l l be organized after the B o a r d discussion o f 
this C A S and during the imp lemen ta t ion o f the C A S . 
136. A D om i n i c a n Repub l ic C l ien t Survey was ca r r ied ou t in December 2004 and January 2005 
to i n f o r m C A S preparation and understand stakeholders ove ra l l imp ress ion o f the B a n k in the 
country, i t s wo rk , and commun ica t ions and outreach strategy.32 The survey findings suggest that 
the B a n k i s trusted and valued b y stakeholders in the coun t ry (more so than in mos t other L a t i n 
Ame r ican countries). Stakeholders are ve ry pos i t ive about the i r re la t ionsh ip w i t h the B a n k and 
see a clear r o l e f o r the B a n k in the D om i n i c a n development process. The m a i n three areas where 
respondents f e l t the B a n k should be i n v o l v e d are: anti-corruption, education, and pove r ty 
reduction. One t h i r d o f the respondents be l ieve the B a n k shou ld focus i t s resources o n the 
energy sector. These findings mean that this C A S w i l l indeed address k e y concerns of 
D om i n i c a n society. I t i s no tewo r thy that the largest gaps be tween areas considered impo r tan t f o r 
B a n k invo lvemen t and B a n k effectiveness re la te t o these high p r i o r i t y areas, i.e., co r rup t ion , the 
energy sector, and pove r ty reduction. This raises questions f o r f o l l o w up such as w h i c h c r i te r ia 
are stakeholders using t o evaluate the bank’s w o r k in these areas; wha t are the i n f o rm a t i o n 
sources f o r these views, and so on. 
137. In terms o f outreach, the D om i n i c a n w r i t t e n med ia was the mos t f requen t ly used source o f 
i n f o rm a t i o n about the Bank . NGO s and b i la te ra l and mu l t i - la te ra l o rgan iza t ion also use the web.

COUNTRY FINANCING PARAMETERS 

Explanation/Remarks 

The  actual cost-sharing would be determined 
during  the preparation of each project. In  most 
projects, the Bank is expected to continue 
financing  less  than 90 percent of project costs. 
The  Bank’s  financing share is expected  to be 
higher for social sector projects  and  lower for 
infrastructure projects. As budget mechanisms 
improve  and  a track record of  adequate  and 
timely allocation of counterpart funds is 
established,  the  Bank may consider  increasing 
its financing  share  up to 100 percent of total 
project costs. 
Recurrent costs financing associated with  Bank 
projects is expected  to be modest. In 
determining  recurrent  cost  financing in 
individual  projects, the Bank would  take into 
consideration sustainability issues at  the  sector 
and project levels. 
The two requirements for Bank  financing  of 
local expenditures are met. Therefore, the  Bank 
can  finance local costs in the proportions 
needed in individual projects. 

Item 

A. Cost  Sharing 
Limit on the proportion of 
individual project costs that the 
Bank  may finance 

Parameter 

Up to 90 percent 

No country level 
limit 

Yes 

B. Recurrent  Cost  Financing 
Any limits that would apply to 
the overall amount of recurrent 
expenditures that the  Bank may 
finance. 

C.  Local  Cost  Financing. Are 
the requirements for Bank 
financing: (i) financing re- 
quirements for the country’s 
development program would 
exceed the public sector’s own 
resources (e.g., from taxation and 
other  revenues) and expected 
domestic borrowing; and (ii) the 
financing  of foreign expenditures 
alone would not enable the Bank 
to  assist in the financing of 

D. Taxes  and  Duties. Are there 
any taxes and duties that the Bank 
would not finance? 

None 

No taxes or duties are currently identified as 
unreasonable  or discriminatory. At the project 
level,  the  Bank  would consider whether taxes 
and duties  constitute an excessively high share 
of project expenditures.

Annex E: CAS Consultations with Dominican Stakeholders 

CAS consultations w i t h loca l stakeholder were held in Santo Dom ing0 and Santiago on January 14 and 
26, 2005 respectively. The W o r l d Bank team was headed by Chr is t ina Ma lmberg-Ca lvo (Coun try 
Manager) and Mass im i l iano Paolucci (Country O f f icer) and inc lud ing Samuel Carlson (Senior HD 
Economist), Pa t r ic ia D e L a Fuente Hoyes (Financial Management Specialist), A le jandra D e L a Paz 
(Public In fo rma t ion Associate) and Be lg ica Reyes (Program Assistant). 

The consultations were organized w i th the support o f the Governance Department o f INTEC, a loca l 
lead ing un ivers i ty , and I-Desarrollo, a loca l consu l t ing firm. P r io r to the consultation, I N T E C and I- 
Desarro l lo conducted a desk rev iew o f the positions o f the pr iva te sector, the c i v i l society and the 
government on fou r key areas fo r the proposed FY05 -09 Coun try Assistance Strategy: (a) re fo rm o f the 
power sector; (b) governance and anti-corruption; competitiveness; and access to and p rov is ion o f 
social services. The objective o f the desk rev iew was to iden t i fy s im i lar i t ies and differences in the 
positions expressed b y the d i f feren t actors on those themes. 

The consultations were attended by approximately 1 10 people representing the Execu t ive Power, 
several ministries (such as Education, Health, Women A f fa i rs , and Finance) the Dom in ican Congress, 
the jud ic ia l power, loca l governments, c i v i l society groups, grass roo t organizations, academia, think 
thanks, pr iva te sector and cooperation agencies. 

The consultations were structured in two segments. The first segment inc luded three power po in t 
presentations on: (a) the W o r l d Bank’s mission, structure and products; (‘c) the current and the F Y 0 5 - 
09 proposed assistance strategies; and (c) the results o f the desk rev iew conducted by INTEC and I- 
Desarrollo. P r io r to the consultations, the participants received a short document describing the same 
themes in a jargon-free fashion. The second segment implied the cons t i tu t ion o f six wo rk ing groups 
who were reques ted to discuss and prov ide their v iews on the proposed W o r l d Bank Coun try Assistance 
Strategy fo r the pe r iod 2005-2009, i t s pillars, and proposed areas o f intervention. 

The consultations h igh l igh ted a so l id consensus around the country’s main developmental challenges 
and pr ior i t ies : a consensus already clearly h igh l igh ted b y the desk review, conducted p r io r to the 
consultations. The pr ior i t ies are: 
(a) re fo rm o f the powe r sector; (b) fight against corrup t ion ; (c) 
rethinking o f the country’s competitiveness scheme; (d) improvemen t in the de l ivery o f pub l ic services, 
par t icu lar ly health and education. In addition, the participants flagged decentralization as a c r i t ica l area 
fo r fu ture development. S im i lar ly , the participants con f i rmed the va l id i ty o f the proposed W o r l d Bank 
assistance strategy fo r the per iod 2005-2009, bo th in terms o f lend ing program and ana ly t ica l studies. 
In addition, they requested that par t icu lar attention be devoted b y the W o r l d Bank to gender and you th 
i s s u e s and that adequate mon i to r ing and evaluation mechanisms, inc lud ing social auditing, be 
implemented to guarantee that the proposed strategy and re la ted funds are implemented e f f ic ien t ly and 
transparently. 

The country’s re fo rm agenda i s ta l l and the W o r l d Bank alone can no t respond to the country’s 
increased need fo r support. The participants were emphatic in h igh l igh t ing the importance o f a
