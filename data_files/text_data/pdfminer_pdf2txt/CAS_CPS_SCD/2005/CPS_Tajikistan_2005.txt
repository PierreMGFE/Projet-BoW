Tajikistan Country Partnership Strategy 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

1. 

T a j i k i s t a n has done well since the signing o f the peace accord in 1997. I t i s 
among the f ew pos t -con f l ic t countries that m o v e d q u i c k l y f r om c i v i l wa r t o in te rna l 
s tab i l i ty and to a func t ion ing government. I t has achieved remarkable economic success, 
averaging 10% g row th a year fo r the past fou r years. I n f l a t i o n i s under control, the 
exchange ra te stabilized, external debt cut in ha l f , and pove r ty markedly reduced. Yet, 
Ta j ik is tan remains the poorest and among the mos t f rag i le o f the C IS countries, and a 
con t inua t ion o f this bright p ic tu re i s by n o means assured. 

.. 

11. 

Ta j ik is tan faces a daunting development agenda-failing 
infrastructure, tenuous 
hea l th and education systems, and weak institutions, especially the f inanc ia l system and 
the c i v i l service. M a g n i f y i n g these challenges are Tajikistan’s geography, i t s 
demography and a repu ta t ion fo r corruption. 

iii. Ta j ik is tan i s landlocked, remote, m a i n l y mountainous, and surrounded by d i f f i c u l t 
neighbors. W h i l e imp roved a i r and transport l i n k s as well as WTO membe rsh ip w o u l d 
enhance Tajikistan’s fo re ign trade potential, in the short run export g r ow t h i s n o t l i k e l y t o 
b e sufficient t o ma in ta in high growth. Domes t ic sources o f g r ow t h must also be tapped 
w h i c h pu ts a p r em i um o n p r iva te sector reforms, especially in agriculture. 

iv. 
The country’s d em o g r a p h i c s - 4 0% o f t h e popu la t ion i s under 15-places huge 
demands o n the Government and the economy, f i r s t t o educate, then t o employ. I f 
education and hea l th services can b e sustained and the bus iness env i ronmen t improved, 
Tajikistan’s y o u t h cou ld be a pos i t ive fo rce f o r fu tu re growth. Howeve r , shou ld these 
systems f a i l and the business c l ima te n o t imp rove , they cou ld be the basis o f future 
ins tab i l i ty . 

v. 
Tajikistan’s weak p u b l i c and p r iva te ins t i tu t ions do n o t p rov ide an env i ronmen t 
conducive t o p r iva te investment, domestic o r foreign. A s the Government i s w e l l aware, 
corruption, b o t h pe t ty and large scale, remains a serious ba r r ie r t o p r iva te sector 
development and pub l ic sector efficiency. Exace rba t ing this s i tua t ion i s the po ten t ia l ly 
corrosive effects o f the drug trade that Tajikistan’s l o n g border with A fghan is tan c o u l d 
generate. 

vi. 
Ta j ik is tan needs t o act s w i f t l y t o consolidate recent achievements and t o d i v e r s i f y 
i t s basis fo r growth-because 
i t i s unlikely that past sources (a pos twa r recove ry in 
p roduc t iv i ty , remittances, and c omm o d i t y exports) w i l l be su f f ic ien t t o ensure con t inued 
future high growth. The immed ia te task i s t o im p r o v e the business env i ronmen t and 
create mo re j o b opportunities at home. A s these immed ia te needs are pursued, the 
Government must also stem the dec l ine in h um a n and phys ica l cap i ta l and increase 
domestic investment, w h i c h n o w stands at less than 13% o f GDP. 

vii. W h i l e Tajikistan’s challenges and needs are enormous, i t has l im i t e d resources t o 
address them. IDA’S annual allocation-at SDR19.6 m i l l i o n , o r SDR3.10 p e r capita-is 
su f f ic ien t fo r one medium-sized r o a d p ro jec t . Mo reove r , the comb ined resources o f a l l 
donors-a mix o f human i ta r ian and deve lopmen ta l aid-is dec l in ing as Ta j ik is tan ex i ts

t h e pos t -con f l ic t stage. I r o n i c a l l y this decline i s tak ing place just as Tajikistan’s 
absorptive capac i ty i s im p r o v i n g as evidenced by s ign i f ican t improvements in the qua l i ty 
o f the IDA p o r t f o l i o . 

viii. 
The Bank G roup and the Government w i l l need t o be extremely creative t o ensure 
that these l i m i t e d resources produce a sizeable impact. The strategy go ing f o rw a r d i s 
meant to b e selective, effective, and practical. The Government and the B a n k G roup 
agreed t o focus this CPS o n three na r row goals: supporting g r ow t h in the immed ia te 
fu tu re by improving domestic economic opportunities, l a y i n g the founda t ion f o r h t u r e 
g r ow t h by p rese rv ing and enhancing the human capital, and exp lo i t ing the country’s 
energy po ten t ia l . Specifically, 

To imp rove business opportunities in r u r a l and u rban areas, the B a n k Group, 
with the I FC in the lead, w i l l support the strengthening o f the f inanc ia l sector, 
reduce t h e cost o f d o i n g business and, with IDA in the lead, w i l l support measures 
t o im p r o v e access t o ag r icu l tu ra l land and reduce ren t ex t rac t ion in the co t ton 
sector. 
T o enhance a n d p r e s ew e the qua l i ty of the human cap i ta l , the B a n k G roup w i l l 
he lp im p r o v e the system o f resource a l loca t ion t o education and health, create 
cond i t ions f o r better teaching and primary schoo l attendance, increase u t i l i z a t i o n 
o f p r im a r y hea l th care, and increase the supply o f safe water in selected areas. 
To exp lo i t the coun t ry ’s hydropower po ten t ia l , the B a n k G roup w i l l support 
e f fo r ts t o increase e f f ic iency o f the domestic energy sector th rough im p r o v e d cost 
recovery, and w i l l assist the Government in a t t rac t ing fo re ign inves tmen t in the 
hyd ropowe r sector. 

i x . 
In each o f the above areas, the B a n k G roup and Government w i l l w o r k t o imp rove 
government capacity and efficiency, and reduce co r rup t ion by giving special emphasis to 
measures that increase transparency o f resource use, reduce d isc re t iona ry controls, and 
encourage the pa r t ic ipa t ion o f users in the p r o v i s i o n o f services. 

x. 
In agreement with the Government, IDA w i l l devote the bulk o f i t s lend ing 
resources t o support hea l th and education programs. This implies necessarily that B a n k 
G roup efforts in the area o f p r iva te sector development w i l l focus p r im a r i l y o n p o l i c y 
framework and business environment issues . And in the energy sector, IDA ’S r o l e w i l l be 
l im i t e d to technical partnership and advice. Howeve r , the B a n k Group, th rough IBRD, 
I F C and guarantee instruments, m a y have a r o l e t o p l a y in suppo r t ing export-oriented 
hydroelectric projects. I F C and MIGA w i l l w o r k t o im p r o v e the c l ima te f o r business, 
with IDA p r o v i d i n g support th rough p o l i c y r e f o rm operations and techn ica l assistance. 
I FC will, o f course, con t inue t o seek investments in the p r iva te sector. 

x i . 
G i v e n resource and capacity constraints, the r e s u l t s f ramewo rk developed with 
the Government sets modest goals f o r the nex t f o u r years. A c h i e v i n g even these modest 
r e s u l t s with the limited available resources and weak ins t i tu t iona l env i ronmen t w i l l be a 
considerable challenge-but one the Government i s de te rm ined t o take on. 

Page i i i 

Ta j ik is tan Coun t ry Pa r tne rsh ip Strategy 

x i i . 
T o p a r t i a l l y offset i t s o w n limited resources, the B a n k G roup w i l l act as a catalyst 
in an effort t o expand Tajikistan’s resource envelope and imp rove e f f ic iency in the use o f 
domestic and dono r resources. Building o n i t s conven ing au tho r i ty and comparative 
advantage as a g loba l know ledge institution, i t w i l l assist the Government t o develop 
sector p l a t f o rm s that bring together donor coa l i t ions in support o f re fo rms in k e y sectors, 
where appropriate th rough the use o f Sector W i d e Approaches (SWAPS). 

xiii. 
This CPS recognizes that r e s u l t s o n the g round can b e achieved o n l y i f a l l l i n k s in 
sector supply chains-the central government, l o c a l governments, commun i t ies and 
households-are 
in place and functioning. T o achieve this, the full range o f B a n k 
ins t rumen ts -deve lopmen t p o l i c y operations, investment operations, techn ica l assistance, 
c omm u n i t y in te rven t ions -w i l l b e b rough t t o bear o n the limited set o f p r io r i t ies 
identified above, a strategy o f “opening m a n y doors t o the same room.” The CPS i s 
therefore selective in outcomes, but brings m u l t i p l e instruments t o bear o n each o f these 
outcomes. 

xiv. This strategy carries s ign i f ican t r i s k s . The m a i n external r i s k s are the v o l a t i l e 
p o l i t i c a l and secu r i ty s i tua t ion in the reg ion and the po ten t ia l ly corrosive effects o f the 
drug t r a n s i t f r o m Afghanistan. Recent events in the K y r g y z Repub l ic and Uzbek is tan 
have increased these r i s k s . The m a i n r i s k t o the B a n k G roup i s that the dono r assistance 
i t i s able t o generate in support o f the Government’s programs m a y n o t b e su f f ic ien t t o 
help Ta j ik is tan overcome i t s formidable development challenges. Unless the 
in tema t iona l c omm u n i t y i s prepared t o increase i t s support t o Tajikistan, this r i s k w i l l 
p e r s i s t even i f imp lemen ta t ion o f the current CPS proceeds as planned. 

xv. 

The f o l l ow i n g questions are proposed f o r discussion by the Execu t ive D i rec to rs : 

e 

e 

e 

I s this strategy sufficiently focused g iven Tajikistan’s ins t i tu t iona l capacity and 
govemance problems? 

A r e Execu t ive D i rec to rs com fo r tab le with the proposed strategy w h i c h i s likely t o 
bring o n l y modest results in the CPS pe r iod? 

I s IDA’S r o l e as a catalyst t o attract add i t iona l resources a p laus ib le one? I s i t 
l i k e l y to b e supported by other development agencies?

The Government’s success i s evident in the economy’s impressive cumu la t ive 
g r ow t h o f almost 60% over the last f ive years, a lbe i t f r om a very l o w base. G r ow t h in

B. CHALLENGES FOR THE FUTURE 

8. 
As T a j i k i s t a n looks to the future, a c r i t ica l challenge to the Government and the 
donor c omm u n i t y w i l l be h o w t o a l ign the country’s vast development needs with i t s 
l im i t e d f i n a n c i a l and ins t i tu t iona l resources. T h r e e overarching characteristics o f 
Ta j ik is tan m u s t l i e at the base o f such an alignment: the country’s geography, i t s 
demography, and i t s weak governance and corruption. 

Geography 

9 . 
One o f the wo r ld ’s mos t isolated countries, Ta j ik is tan i s 2,000 k i lome te rs f r om 
the nearest po r t , 93% mountainous, and in a d i f f i c u l t neighborhood. High moun ta ins 
separate i t from two ne ighbo r ing countries, the K y r g y z Repub l ic and China. I t s l o n g 
border with A fghan is tan creates security and drug t r a f f i c k i n g problems. I t s f o u r t h 
neighbor, Uzbekistan, considers i t a security risk and maintains tight con t ro ls ove r the 
border, con t ro ls that have been strengthened f o l l ow i n g even ts in And i jan . W h i l e transit 
and trade th rough Afghanistan, Pakistan, and I r a n m a y someday p l a y a role, Tajikistan’s 
access to po ten t ia l export markets w i l l rema in constrained f o r the foreseeable future. 

10. 
Ta j ik is tan ’s unfavorable geography has an impo r tan t im p l i c a t i o n f o r i t s g r ow t h 
strategy: t o compensate f o r it, i t has to w o r k harder than other countries t o attract 
investment. In addition, w h i l e imp roved a i r and transport l i n k s as w e l l as WTO 
membership w o u l d enhance Tajikistan’s fo re ign trade potential, in the short run export 
g r ow t h i s n o t l i k e l y t o be su f f ic ien t t o ma in ta in high g row th . Domes t ic sources o f g r ow t h 
must also be tapped w h i c h puts an add i t iona l p r em i um o n p r iva te sector reforms, 
especially in agriculture. 

Demography 

11. With 40% o f i t s popu la t ion under the age o f 15, Tajikistan’s y o u t h w i l l b e a m a i n 
force in de te rm in ing the country’s economic fu tu re and s tab i l i ty . The coun t ry challenge 
in serving i t s y o u t h i s underscored by the fact that the coun t ry is, as o f now, u n l i k e l y to 
m e e t s ix Millennium Deve lopmen t Goals (MDG): c h i l d mo r ta l i ty , ma te rna l mo r ta l i ty , 
gender equa l i ty in school, school enrollment, inc idence o f H I V / A I D S and tuberculosis, 
and access t o imp roved water sources. The l i k e l i h o o d o f mee t ing the income p o v e r t y 
reduc t ion target i s also n o t assured (see A t tachmen t 7 o n M D G s and the i r costing). 
Indeed, recent trends in school enrollment, c h i l d mo r ta l i ty , ma te rna l mo r ta l i ty , and 
H I V / A I D S prevalence appear to be m o v i n g in the w r o n g direction.’ Ta j ik is tan ’s future 
w i l l depend o n the Government’s a b i l i t y t o stem the decline in these ind ica to rs and t o 
re ta in and expand o n the human cap i ta l i n h e r i t e d f r o m the Sov ie t system.6 

’ Adm in is t ra t ive and survey data tend t o d i f f e r o n the ex ten t t o w h i c h i n f a n t a n d ma te rna l m o r t a l i t y have 
changed since the 1990s.

Medium-Term Macroeconomic Outlook

Ta j ik is tan ’s medium-term economic prospects are expected t o r em a i n b r o a d l y

0 T o encourage equitable, labor-intensive economic growth, with an emphasis o n 
exports. 
0 T o support the e f f ic ien t and fa i r p r o v i s i o n o f basic social services. 
0 T o target support t o the poorest groups o f the population. 
T o im p r o v e governance and security. 
These ob jec t ives are at the base o f the strategy ou t l ined in th is document. 

32. 
T h e Government i s n o w f i n a l i z i n g the second PRSP Progress Repo r t and i s

consolidate i t s development agenda (the PRSP and the long - te rm Soc ia l Econom ic 
Deve lopmen t Plan) in a single document t o p rov ide clearer guidance o n p o l i c y and 
resource allocation. The k e y aspects o f the strategy under r e v i s i o n inc lude p u b l i c sector 
reform, business development, education and hea l th financing, ag r icu l tu re modernization, 
and infrastructure. 

33. 

The Government assigns a high p r i o r i t y t o r e f o rm i n g the p u b l i c sector-to 
imp rove 
adm in is t ra t ive effectiveness and reduce corruption. A high-level Presidential W o r k i n g 
G roup has been fo rmed t o develop a p u b l i c sector r e f o rm strategy a imed at mode rn iz ing 
the adm in is t ra t ive architecture and im p r o v i n g c i v i l service management and p a y 
incentives. In addition, the Government i s exp lo r ing ways t o reduce excessive state 
interference in business development-for 
example, by abo l ish ing the remnants o f central 
p lann ing and by s t ream l in ing l icens ing and inspec t ion regimes. As an example, a l a w n o w 
in the f i n a l phases o f d ra f t ing w o u l d cut by 50% the number o f licenses business need. 

34. 
In agriculture, the Government’s short-term p r i o r i t y i s t o find equitable and 
affordable solutions t o the high co t ton farm-debt p rob lem . O the r elements o f the sector 
strategy inc lude con t inu ing the farm l a n d p r i v a t i z a t i o n program, im p r o v i n g compe t i t ion 
in farm inpu ts and co t ton marketing, and rehab i l i ta t ing i r r i g a t i o n infrastructure. 

35. 
In education and health, the Government has an amb i t ious p rog ram o f re fo rms 
supported by a s low but steady increase in budget allocations t o these sectors. F o r 
education, structural changes are being p i l o t e d in several rayons, i n c l u d i n g the in t roduc t ion 
o f per capita based funding t o imp rove incentives and in te r reg iona l equity. F o r health, the 
Government i s increasing i t s focus o n p r im a r y hea l th care-it p i l o t e d a basic benefits 
package in t w o rayons in 2004, and i t intends t o scale the package up na t iona l ly in 2005. 

36. 
The Government also sees deve lop ing the country’s hyd ropowe r infrastructure f o r 
e lec t r ic i ty and a lum inum exports and im p r o v i n g i t s reg iona l transport ne two rks as 
impo r tan t p r io r i t ies . T o support th is agenda, the Gove rnmen t has comm i t ted t o

F o r TadAZ , the recent scandal i n v o l v i n g a substantial loss from the T a d A Z accounts has

38. 
T h e p rev ious Ta j ik is tan Coun t ry Assistance Strategy (CAS) focused o n 
im p r o v i n g services t o people, fos te r ing p r iva te sector development, and con t inu ing the 
longe r t e rm task o f building ins t i tu t ions f o r a ma rke t economy. These are medium te rm 
goals and the strategy took a medium te rm perspective, a rgu ing that t o achieve results 
w o u l d requ i re f i v e t o seven years o r longer. A r e v i ew o f outcomes after just ove r two 
years o f imp lemen ta t ion suggests that while there has been progress (in p r iva te 
ag r icu l tu ra l activities, p r iva t iza t ion o f state enterprises, f inanc ia l sector re fo rm , 
government capacity building, hea l th and education sector strategies, l o c a l infrastructure) 
the approach needed adjusting. 

39. 
The FY03-05 strategy was centered o n enhancing the pa r t ic ipa t ion o f l o c a l 
governments and communities in p u b l i c service delivery, supported by a u n i f i e d p rog ram 
o f dono r assistance. In parallel, support was t o b e p r o v i d e d t o the cen t ra l government t o 
build and strengthen ins t i tu t ions needed f o r the coun t ry 's longe r te rm development. This 
approach requ i red Government acceptance o f l o c a l pa r t ic ipa t ion in the development 
process and a high degree o f dono r coo rd ina t ion and harmonization. 

40. 
A s the Boa rd recognized w h e n the C A S was presented, the strategy was n o t 
w i t h o u t i t s r i s k s . A l t h o u g h s t i l l ea r ly t o judge, a p r e l im i n a r y assessment suggests that 
w h i l e the FY03 -05 strategy did de l ive r o n the lending and AAA goals set ou t in the 
document, the ove ra l l development f ramewo rk did n o t develop at the p lanned pace. The 
Government saw the focus o n l o c a l commun i t ies as an NGO-driven agenda disconnected 
f r om i t s p r im a r y concern o f s ta te -bu i ld ing and enhancing cen t ra l government capacity. 
The dono r commun i ty was s low t o come together, due in pa r t t o the re la t ive newness o f 
donor activities in Ta j ik is tan and in pa r t t o the absence o f the Government 's comm i tmen t . 
The analysis suggests therefore that w h i l e the goals o f the p rev ious C A S r em a i n valid, a 
mo re t rad i t iona l sector-oriented approach m a y b e needed t o demonstrate the va lue o f 

A deb t reso lu t ion strategy, p r o t e c t i n g the rights a n d in teres ts o f farmers, has b e e n r e c e n t l y agreed

41. 
In the p rev ious strategy, IDA - f i n a n c e d interventions were designed t o test new 
po l ic ies and approaches. T o move f r om these p i l o t s to na t ionw ide coverage, the n ew 
IDA strategy w i l l need t o b e mo re n a r r ow l y focused in terms o f b o t h p r io r i t ies and w i l l 
have t o find ways o f increasing the impac t o f donor and government resources unde r 
c omm o n strategies. 

42. 
The Bank Group’s analytic and adv iso ry activities, while g o o d technically, did 
n o t always have the desired impac t o n p o l i c y due o f ten t o a lack o f government 
ownership and weak l i n k s t o the lend ing program. The w o r k did, however, con t r ibu te t o 
the Bank’s understanding o f pove r ty patterns, the country’s energy potential, f inanc ia l 
sector issues, and the agenda f o r p u b l i c sector r e f o rm and thus p rov ides a s o l i d basis fo r 
the d e s i g n o f t h i s CPS. 

43. 
Experience f r om the past C A S also supports lessons f r om other l o w i n c om e 
countries under s t ress (LICUS): in weak ins t i tu t iona l environments, development p o l i c y 
lend ing needs t o focus o n simple, p o l i t i c a l l y feasible re fo rms and b e backed by sector- 
specific projects, capacity-building, and commun ica t ion campaigns. Ta j ik is tan ’s capacity 
f o r p o l i c y design and imp lemen ta t ion continues t o b e limited, and p o l i c y operations 
under the n e w strategy mus t re f lec t this. 

44. 
IFC ’s experience during the last C A S p e r i o d shows that techn ica l assistance and 
p ro jec t f inanc ing are mos t successful when the re i s an ea r ly convergence o f interests 
between the p r iva te sector and the Government in p ro jec t d e s i g n and imp lemen ta t ion . 
This was demonstrated in the lega l and regu la to ry f ramewo rk p ro jec ts re la ted t o 
m ic ro f inance and leasing, the SME survey, and ac t ion plans t o address p rob lems related 
t o the business environment-as well as in the p i l o t Farm Owne rsh ip Mode l , w h i c h 
looked at alternative f inanc ing mechanisms f o r farmers.

The Government’s generally p o o r statistics and weak m o n i t o r i n g capab i l i ty made

46. 
One pos i t ive lesson f r om the past C A S p e r i o d i s that p o r t f o l i o pe r fo rmance can be 
imp roved even in d i f f i c u l t imp lemen ta t ion environments. F r o m a l o w o f 11% in FY03,

A s the rev iew o f the last C A S suggests, Government ownership remains essential t o 
successful imp lemen ta t ion . T o strengthen ownership the B a n k team tumed t o a process 
used with success in p repa r ing a strategy f o r Kazakhstan, a m i d d l e income country. As an 
i n i t i a l step t ow a r d agreeing o n goals and instruments, the CPS team organized a two -day 
b ra ins to rm ing session between senior Bank G roup colleagues and essentially the entire 
team o f Gove rnmen t dec is ion makers, inc lud ing seven ministers, in Warsaw in Feb rua ry 
2005.13 T h i s meeting h a d t w o bene f i ts . I t ensured that the B a n k and Government teams 
heard each other, and i t p r o v i d e d a venue f o r the Government team t o discuss among 
themselves the d i f f icu l t trade-offs that a l loca t ing constrained resources requires and t o 
speak with one vo ice o n their choices. The Gove rnmen t left this mee t ing with a clear 
understanding that th is was t o b e the i r strategy as w e l l as the Bank’s. With a basic ou t l ine 
o f the strategy in hand, t h e B a n k G roup then me t with c i v i l society representatives t o hear 
the i r views (see Attachment 10) and consulted other dono r organizations t o secure the i r 
support.

C . BANK GROUP PROGRAM TO SUPPORT THE STRATEGIC OUTCOMES 

Strategic Objectives 

53. 

As the analysis discussed in the f i r s t part o f th is document suggests, th is CPS w i l l 
con t inue the B a n k Group’s focus o n ma in ta in ing g r ow t h in the short t e rm and building a 
founda t ion f o r g r ow t h in the future. A m a j o r consideration during discussions with the 
Government was the necessity, d r iven by limited IDA, f o r Bank assistance t o b e highly 
selective. At the conc lus ion o f the Warsaw mee t ing the Government asked the B a n k t o 
focus i t s p rog ram o n three strategic objectives: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

Im p r o v e business opportunities in r u r a l and u rban areas 
Preserve and enhance the q u a l i t y o f hea l th and education 
Im p r o v e the de l ive ry o f energy services and exp lo i t the country’s hyd ropowe r 
po ten t ia l 

These three objectives are t o b e supported by a cross-cutting theme o f im p r o v i n g na t iona l 
governance and reduc ing co r rup t ion th rough strengthening the state’s ins t i tu t iona l capacity. 
A brief ou t l ine o f the approach t o ach iev ing each o f these objectives fo l lows . 

Anticipated Results 

54. 
The results f ramewo rk developed by the Government and the Bank G roup seeks a 
balance between the n e e d f o r short t e r m results and the recogn i t ion that in m a n y areas o f

CPS the agreed targets are t o reverse the dec l ine in p u b l i c service de l ive ry , i n c l u d i n g

The approach and instruments IDA w i l l use t o deliver these results are discussed

A s the Co-Chair o f the Consultative G roup (CG) process, IDA i s also p l a y i n g a key

tumed f r om a focus o n money and p ledg ing towa rd a dialogue o n the country’s strategic 
p r io r i t ies and programs t o m e e t them. The C G meetings are n o w always h e l d in Dushanbe 
and the President always attends. These events have evo lved i n t o an impo r tan t f o r um f o r

dono r commun i ty . They are an impo r tan t pa r t o f the ha rmon iza t ion process. 

82. 

The Bank G roup has a g r ow i n g reco rd o f partnerships with donors in a numbe r o f 
CPS areas, as re f lec ted in Attachment 9 . T o highlight a few, in hea l th the Swed ish 
In te rna t iona l Deve lopmen t Agency (S IDA ) has comm i t ted t o co-finance the proposed 
C omm u n i t y and Bas ic H e a l t h Care P ro jec t with about U S $ 6 m i l l i o n . In energy, building 
o n the successful partnership o f the Swiss Government and A g a K h a n Deve lopmen t 
N e tw o r k (AKDN) with IDA and I F C under the P am i r P r iva te Powe r Project, the Swiss 
Government proposed US $ 8 m i l l i o n in co - f inanc ing f o r last year’s E n e r g y L o s s 
Reduc t ion Project. In the area o f statistics, several donors, such as the IMF, ADB, 
EUROSTAT , UNDP, UN ICEF , DFID, S I D A and the Swiss Agency f o r Deve lopmen t 
and Coope ra t ion (SDC) are already w o r k i n g together t o support the imp lemen ta t ion o f 
the Government’s mu l t i -yea r plan fo r statistical re fo rm . As men t ioned before, the IFC 
and EBRD have put in place several j o i n t facilities, such as the M i c r o and Sm a l l 
Enterprise Fac i l i ty . Partnerships are also b e i n g fo rged in education, r u r a l finance, soc ia l 
investments, agriculture and p u b l i c finance. These successes notwithstanding, m u c h 
mo re can and shou ld b e done o n the partnership f ron t . 

83. 
Given IDA’S limited f inanc ia l resources, the B a n k G roup must r e l y o n other 
donors t o address impo r tan t areas n o t covered in the CPS. In the area o f trade and 
transport fac i l i ta t ion and infiastructure, the Asian Deve lopmen t B a n k (ADB), Is lam ic 
Deve lopmen t B a n k (IDB) and European Comm iss ion (EC) have f inanced a numbe r o f 
projects, i n c l u d i n g those o n road transport, wa te r supply, and powe r generation and 
transmission. They are planning t o stay ac t ive in th is area. L e g a l and j u d i c i a l r e f o rm i s

The EBRD has a substantial p rog ram to ta l ing some US$45 m i l l i o n in the areas o f p r iva te 
sector development, focused o n S M E and m i c r o enterprises; f inanc ia l sector; and trade

The strategy se t ou t in this CPS was the subject o f extensive consultations with 
donors i n c l u d i n g v i s i t s to donor headquarters, roundtables and meetings in Dushanbe, 
and rev iews o f d ra f t documents during the CPS preparation. As discussed earlier, t o

In L ICU S - l i k e countries such as Tajikistan, there i s a pe renn ia l r i s k that weak

Tajikistan 's recent successes also present a r i s k t o the imp lemen ta t ion o f this 
strategy. A comb ina t ion o f high economic growth, the Russian debt deal, proposed large 
investments in Tajikistan 's hydroelectric and a lum inum sectors by Russ ian entities c o u l d 
lead t h e authorities to believe that add i t iona l re fo rms can wa i t . Given Tajikistan 's f rag i le 
economic and soc ia l setting, any slackening o f the r e f o rm effort, especially in 
governance, state owned enterprise accountability, cotton, and energy sectors, w o u l d n o t 
o n l y render the goals se t ou t in this CPS unattainable but put recent gains at r isk .

Attachment 2: Tajikistan CAS Completion Report, FYO3-05 

I. INTRODUCTION 

1. 
This Comp le t ion Repo r t rev iews the FY03 -05 Coun t ry Assistance Strategy, 
discussed by the B o a r d in Feb rua ry 2003.' This was the third C A S fo r Ta j ik is tan and the 
f i r s t one based o n Tajikistan 's PRSP. The Repo r t i s an in teg ra l pa r t o f the FY 0 6 - 0 9 C A S 
package, and has p rov ided substantial input i n t o the preparation o f the new CAS . The 
C A S eva lua t ion was done by the Bank G roup coun t ry team in close cooperation with the 
Government. A f t e r an i n i t i a l review m iss ion to Dushanbe in October 2004, the findings 
were rev iewed j o i n t l y by the B a n k G roup team and the Government at a C A S 
b ra ins to rm ing meeting in Warsaw in February 2005 and during the m a i n C A S m i s s i o n in 
M a r c h - A p r i l 2005. The coun t ry team also discussed the m a i n lessons and imp l ica t ions 
f o r the n ew C A S during a coun t ry team retreat in January 2005 and at several subsequent 
coun t ry team meetings. 

2. 
The C A S p rov ided lending and grants f o r f o u r projects to ta l ing US$58 m i l l i o n 
and con t r ibu ted about US $ 2 m i l l i o n t o one reg iona l IDA grant - Cen t ra l A s i a H I V / A I D S 
p ro jec t (US$26.9 m i l l i o n , FY05 ) . Thus, the u t i l i z a t i o n o f the IDA lending envelope o f 
US $ 8 0 m i l l i o n fo r FY 0 3 -FY 0 5 un fo r tuna te ly f e l l short by US $ 2 0 m i l l i o n . T w o m a i n 
factors con t r ibu ted to this sho r t fa l l - the IDA a l loca t ion cuts, o w i n g to the shortage o f 
I D A 1 3 resources in FY05 , and delays with p ro jec t preparation. The B a n k G roup also 
delivered a substantive number o f impo r tan t Econom ic and Sector W o r k (ESW) reports 
t o Ta j ik is tan over the C A S period: Pove r ty Update, a Coun t ry Procurement 
Accoun tab i l i ty Review (CPAR), a Coun t ry F inanc ia l Accoun tab i l i ty Assessment 
(CFAA ) , a Pub l ic Expenditure and Ins t i tu t iona l Review (PEIR), a H e a l t h Sector No te , a 
Gender Rev iew , an Energy U t i l i t i e s Review, an Investment C l ima te Review ( ICA ) , and 
an assessment o f the impac t o f co t ton fa rm land r e f o rm o n pove r ty . Ta j ik is tan also 
benefited f r om several central A s i a reg iona l s tud ies such as the Reg iona l E l e c t r i c i t y 
E x p o r t Po ten t ia l Study (REEPS), H I V / A I D S Report, Tuberculosis Study, and Trade and 
Transport Fac i l i ta t ion Report. 

3 . 
This Repo r t takes i n t o account that the FY 0 3 - 0 5 C A S was des igned f o r t h e 
medium t e r m - f i v e t o seven years - and therefore m a n y o f the expected r e s u l t s are s t i l l 
wo rks in progress. Hence, the analysis focuses n o t o n l y o n achieved outcomes but also on 
intermediate indicators o f progress. 

I. OVERALL DEVELOPMENTS

After the i n t em a l con f l ic t ended in 1997, the p r io r i t ies o f t h e Government

An imp roved macroeconomic environment has accompanied the economic

2004, and in tema t iona l r e s e r v e s have increased t o ove r two mon ths o f impo r ts . The 
govemmen t revenues have increased as a percentage o f GD P and the f isca l de f ic i t stood 
at 2.7% o f GD P in 2004. The external debt burden has eased s ign i f ican t ly - f r om a

111. COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY IMPACT 

A. Strategic Context 

6. 
The FY03 -05 C A S was based o n Tajikistan’s 2002 PRSP, w h i c h se t the 
objectives to: (a) encourage equitable, labor-intensive economic growth, with emphasis 
o n exports; (b) support the e f f ic ien t and fa i r p r o v i s i o n o f basic social services; (c) target 
support t o the poorest groups o f the population; and (d) imp rove govemance and 
~ e c u r i t y . ~ 

7. 
The C A S was w e l l a l igned with the PRSP at the l e v e l o f b road objectives. 
However, the b road nature o f the PRSP agenda and the presence o f an alternative 
govemment development p rog ram made i t d i f f i c u l t t o a l ign the objectives at the 
imp lemen ta t ion l e v e l . The C A S objectives we re to : (i) generate g r ow t h th rough p r iva te 
sector development; (ii) address the mos t c r i t i c a l soc ia l needs o f the p o o r th rough greater 
commun i ty involvement; and (iii) continue building the ins t i tu t ions needed f o r a ma rke t 
economy. The CAS sought t o comb ine a top -down with a bo t tom -up approach t o 
imp rove govemance and generate g row th . The top -down ob jec t ive was t o assist in 
im p r o v i n g i t s macroeconomic and budgetary management, r e f o rm the c i v i l service and 
pub l ic adm in is t ra t ion and develop sector strategies t o build the basis f o r stronger service 
delivery systems. The bo t tom -up strategy was t o develop the capacity t o de l ive r services 
at the l o c a l leve l , w i t h c omm u n i t y pa r t ic ipa t ion . Over time, these t w o approaches were 
to converge to generate strong and transparent delivery sys tems f o r p u b l i c services. 

8. 
The C A S took a f ive to seven-year perspective, e v e n i f the p rog rams we re built 
around the t rad i t iona l three-year f ramewo rk . A l t h o u g h the C A S agenda was ambitious, 

2 

The cumu la t ive g r ow t h was a lmos t 60% ove r the las t 5 years. 
T w o PRSP updates were p r o d u c e d in 2004 and 2005 and were r e v i ew e d by the B a n k a n d the IMF. (The 
Jo in t S t a f f N o t e o n the 2005 PRSP Progress R e p o r t i s schedu led f o r subm iss ion t o the E x e c u t i v e D i r e c t o r s

B. Eva lua t ion Summa ry 

9 . 

Ta j ik is tan has made s ign i f ican t progress in mee t ing i t s PRSP objectives during 
this C A S pe r iod . Some PRSP objectives set fo r 2006/2007 have already been exceeded. 
F o r example, economic g r ow t h and pove r ty reduc t ion outcomes have been outstanding 
and higher than expected. In addition, good progress has been made in mac ro - 
s tab i l iza t ion and debt reduction, as well as in increasing the r o l e o f the p r iva te sector, 
especially in agriculture. The f inanc ia l sector has been stabilized, a l though i t s t i l l fa l ls 
short o f mee t ing the demands o f the p roduc t ive sectors. The f inanc ia l d isc ip l ine in the 
pub l ic sector i s stronger, i n c l u d i n g in some large state-owned enterprises. W o r k has 
commenced o n building the ins t i tu t ions f o r p u b l i c resource management and o n 
re fo rm ing the c i v i l service. Howeve r , a great deal remains t o b e done t o im p r o v e the 
management o f pub l ic resources. A t ten t ion to tw o impo r tan t sectors o f the economy - 
co t ton and powe r - has increased, i n c l u d i n g th rough imp roved understanding o f the m a i n 
impediments t o unleashing their full po ten t ia l . 

10. 
A l t h o u g h the B a n k has been ac t ive in m a n y o f the above areas, i t i s d i f f i c u l t to 
de te rm ine the exact impac t o f i t s ac t iv i t ies o n the achieved resu l ts . Howeve r , the Bank 
Group’s w o r k in the areas o f p r iva t iza t ion and p r iva te sector development, p u b l i c 
expenditure management, fa rm restructuring, i r r i g a t i o n rehabilitation, f inanc ia l sector 
reform, hea l th and education has undoub ted ly h a d a pos i t ive impac t o n the coun t ry ’s 
success men t ioned above.

An impo r tan t achievement during the C A S p e r i o d i s a higher q u a l i t y o f the 
dialogue with the Government, w h i c h has a l lowed b o t h s ides t o have a b e t t e r 
understanding o f the m a i n challenges and the w a y fo rwa rd . 

12. 
The s ign i f ican t imp rovemen t in the p o r t f o l i o performance i s another m a j o r 
achievement during the C A S pe r iod . At the end o f FY05 , the e n t i r e p o r t f o l i o w i l l be 
rated satisfactory. Mo reove r , the disbursement r a t i o stands at 30% o f outstanding 
commitments - higher than the E C A average ra t io o f 22% and an unprecedented 
disbursement ra t io f o r a L I C U S coun t ry . F ina l ly , the p r o - a c t i v i t y ind ica to r has been 
100% throughout the C A S pe r iod . 

13 . 

The greatest sho r tcom ing in the imp lemen ta t ion o f the C A S has been the limited 
advances made in im p r o v i n g service delivery na t ionw ide . The W o r l d B a n k and other 
donor e f fo r ts have centered o n l im i t e d interventions in selected geographic areas, and 
scaling-up these e f fo r ts na t ionw ide i s y e t t o take place. W h i l e i t i s n o t reasonable to 
expect the scaling-up to have happened with the l im i t e d IDA resources during the brief 
two-year pe r iod o f this C A S implementation, i t i s impo r tan t to recognize wha t wo rks o r 
no t and why.

G o o d progress was made in meeting the C A S objectives under th is p i l l a r . As 
no ted before, the pove r ty count f e l l s ign i f ican t ly during the C A S period, exceeding the 
75% target. I t i s d i f f i c u l t t o evaluate the direct C A S impac t o n th is outcome, but the 
Bank’s mac ro dialogue as w e l l as programs in ag r icu l tu re and soc ia l sectors, i n c l u d i n g 
the Social Investment Fund, are be l ieved t o have con t r ibu ted t o t h i s success. In addition, 
IDA has helped t o imp rove the statistical capacity o f the coun t ry to measure and track 
pove r ty patterns and social indicators. Jo in t ly with the UK Department f o r In te rna t iona l 
Deve lopmen t (DFID) i t he lped the Government t o complete the Ta j ik is tan Living 
Standards Su rvey (TLSS) in 2003. This su rvey has updated i n f o rm a t i o n o n p o v e r t y and 
has set the basis f o r complementary surveys (2004) t o exp lo re the patterns o f energy 
consumption and the status o f service de l ive ry in hea l th and education. The Government, 
with the Bank’s help, has made progress in the cons t ruc t ion o f a p o v e r t y map, w h i c h w i l l 
fac i l i ta te the evaluation o f the impac t o f Government and dono r p o v e r t y reduc t ion

measurement tools fo r the MDG targets. The ongo ing and n ew w o r k under the Bank’s 
sector operations in health, education and water supply shou ld help address this i s s u e 
during the nex t C A S period.

17. 
The C A S did no t seek to have a d i rec t effect o n the macroeconomic outcomes, 
wh ich , as repo r ted above, have imp roved considerably, i n c l u d i n g high growth, l o w 
i n f l a t i o n and l o w f isca l deficits. In addition, in te rna l revenue m o b i l i z a t i o n by the 
Government has ma rg ina l ly increased and n o w stands at 16% o f GDP, arguably s t i l l 
b e l ow the amount that the coun t ry needs t o m o b i l i z e given the needs o f the popu la t ion . 
Leg is la t ion has been passed t o e l im ina te directed credit, but there i s a r i s k o f non - 
compliance. The slowest progress has b e e n seen in reduc ing the quas i - f isca l de f ic i t , 
estimated at over 20% o f GDP, m o s t l y o r ig ina t ing f r om the energy sector (1 5% o f GDP).

Progress has been made towards mee t ing mos t o f t h e C A S ind ica to rs in this area, 
but mo re time i s needed t o reach some o f them. Howeve r , the B a n k G roup support t o

share in the economy i s s t i l l sma l l at around 50% (up f r om 45% t w o years ago), w h i l e the 
state continues t o p l a y a dominant r o l e in the economy through: (i) owne rsh ip o f large 
enterprises; (ii) regu la to ry powers and ma rke t con t ro ls (e.g., in the p r o d u c t i o n and sa le o f

Privatization. A l though , the C A S did n o t inc lude p r iva t iza t ion outcomes, 
p r iva t iza t ion has p layed an impo r tan t r o l e in the dialogue between the Gove rnmen t and 
the Bank . I t s support came th rough the adjustment operation - SAC 2 - and a techn ica l 
assistance p ro jec t - I B T A 2 . P o l i c y d ia logue and ana ly t ica l w o r k complemented this 
support. The m a i n outcome in p r iva t iza t ion was the adop t ion o f a p r i v a t i z a t i o n strategy 
in Novembe r 2003, cove r ing mos t o f the m e d i um and large en te rp r ises , t o b e 
implemented f r om 2004 t o 2007. Imp lemen ta t ion o f the p rog ram i s ahead o f schedule. 
In 2004, 13 1 enterprises were p r iva t ized against an agreed target o f 1 10. Imp lemen ta t ion 
o f the p r iva t iza t ion p rog ram continues t o b e o n track. The target f o r 2005 i s 1 17; o f these

F i n a n c i a l Sector. An impo r tan t outcome during this pe r iod has been a stronger 
f inanc ia l sector. Va r ious p o l i c y decisions and leg is la t ive in i t ia t ives supported by the 
B a n k and IMF have helped t o strengthen i t . F o r instance, the abo l i t ion o f taxes o n 
fo re ign bank transfers has con t r ibu ted t o the g r ow t h o f the bank ing sector. Be tween 2002 
and 2004, the net transfer o f remittances th rough the bank ing sector wen t up f r om US$65 
m i l l i o n to US$3 13 m i l l i o n . B a n k deposits grew ten fo ld between 2002 and 2004. Also, 
an amendment t o the Tax Code a l lowed banks t o deduct l o a n loss p rov is ions fo r non - 
standard loans; and the l a w o n co l la te ra l has been imp roved . The N a t i o n a l B a n k o f 
Ta j ik is tan (NBT) has l ikew ise imp roved i t s regu la to ry practices and has c losed five 
comme rc ia l banks that did n o t c om p l y with the minimum cap i ta l requirements. An 
impo r tan t r e s u l t o f these measures has been a reduc t ion o f the interest ma rg ins and 
lending rates. 

21. 
Given the importance o f sma l l scale entrepreneurship, the I F C p r o v i d e d support t o 
imp rove the access o f sma l l and m i c r o enterprises to f inanc ia l resources. T h i s support 
l e d t o the adop t ion o f m ic ro f inance leg is la t ion in 2004, and the corresponding p ruden t ia l

t o f inanc ia l intermediaries t o imp rove their capacity t o service the p roduc t ive sectors. 
However, an IDA bank ing operation did n o t materialize, as i t was j u d g e d that the 
necessary preconditions we re n o t in place fo r the bank ing sector t o absorb such support. 

22. 
D e s p i t e th is progress, the f inanc ia l sector remains weak, and fu r the r conso l ida t ion

Budget. The B a n k encouraged the Government t o increase the budge ta ry 
allocations t o hea l th and education. Resource allocations t o education as a percentage o f 
GDP indeed took place,22 but the hea l th a l loca t ion increased o n l y m a r g i n a l l y and stood at 
around 1.5 % o f GDP in 2004.23 S ign i f ican t salary increases repo r ted ly have raised the 
allocations f o r hea l th and education in 2005. M u c h remains t o be done in linking 
budgetary allocations t o PRSP objectives, especially in the social sectors. 

42. 
E f f o r t s were also made to imp rove the intra-sector a l loca t ion o f resources in 
hea l th and education. The ob jec t ive he re has b e e n to m o v e f r om allocations based o n 
no rms (such as number o f beds) to a fo rmu la that better re f lec ts the demand f o r services. 
Some progress in imp lemen t ing a new system o f budgetary allocations has been made at 
the l e v e l o f B a n k projects and projects o f other donors. The B a n k has also supported the 
in t roduc t ion o f a Bas ic Bene f i t Package and has assisted in the des ign ing o f a case-based

Central Asia. Ta j ik is tan i s n o w ready t o d raw o n this fac i l i ty , given the progress i t has

Education. Imp lemen ta t ion o f the Educa t ion M o d e r n i z a t i o n P ro jec t has started in 
tw o o f ou t f ive p lanned districts. In these rayons, school in f ras t ruc tu re has im p r o v e d and 
the experience with c omm u n i t y pa r t ic ipa t ion th rough PTAs i s repo r ted as successful. 
The B a n k has also b e e n supporting the in t roduc t ion o f pe r cap i ta f inanc ing and has 
implemented the approach in one district; other donors support i t s imp lemen ta t ion in fou r 
add i t iona l districts. With Bank’s support, the Ministry o f Educa t ion has made progress 
with cu r r icu lum r e f o rm and has imp roved i t s ins t i tu t iona l capacity t o oversee tex tbook 
quality. 

47. 
Thus, the progress made so far in hea l th and education has h a d o n l y limited 
impac t o n the na t iona l outcomes in these sectors, but the C A S has helped t o set the basis 
fo r mo re ambitious undertakings during the nex t C A S pe r iod . Fu r the r w o r k w o u l d have 
to inc lude (i) increased a l loca t ion o f pub l ic funds t o these sectors; (ii) im p r o v e d 
government effectiveness in the p lann ing and a l loca t ion o f resources; (iii) greater 
transparency in expenditure, i n c l u d i n g the fo rma l iza t ion o f i n f o rm a l payments; (iv) 
imp roved donor coordination; and (v) increased c omm u n i t y invo lvemen t . 

Community Led Development (CLD) 

48. 
A l t h o u g h the C A S emphasized the r o l e that commun i t ies c o u l d p l a y in stemming 
the deterioration in the de l ive ry o f basic services, i t did n o t propose specific outcomes in 
this area. The FY 0 3 - 0 5 strategy employed a two -p ronged approach in w h i c h the 
pa r t ic ipa t ion o f l o c a l governments and commun i t ies was t o b e comb ined with a unified 
donor p rog ram to address p u b l i c service needs. In parallel, support was t o b e given t o the 
central government in i t s e f fo r t to build ins t i tu t ions that w o u l d se rve future needs. This 
approach required com fo r t o n the Government’s pa r t with the pa r t ic ipa t ion o f c omm u n i t y 
and loca l governments in the development process and a higher than usua l l e v e l o f donor 
coo rd ina t ion and ha rmon iza t ion . As the B o a r d recogn ized when i t was presented, this 
strategy was n o t w i t h o u t r i s k . W h i l e i t has yielded pos i t ive results, i t i s fa i r t o say that i t 
did n o t take roo t as planned. On the Government’s s ide the focus o n l o c a l commun i t ies 
was seen as an NGO - d r i v e n agenda n o t connected t o pressing concerns w i t h state- 
building and enhancing cen t ra l government capacity. The dono r c omm u n i t y was also 
s low t o come together due in pa r t to the re la t ive ly l o w starting l e v e l o f dono r 
coo rd ina t ion in Dushanbe. 

49. 
A t the p ro jec t level, the results o f the C L D approach have been pos i t ive . F o r 
example, commun i ty pa r t ic ipa t ion has wo rked we l l in education, th rough PTAs and also 
as pa r t o f an e f fo r t to put in place an ea r ly wa rn ing system t o m i t iga te the r i s k s posed by 
Lake Sarez. In addition, B a n k assistance has con t r ibu ted to the c rea t ion o f 29 ou t o f a 
to ta l o f 38 water user associations in the country.24 Mo reove r , leg is la t ion i s under 
consideration to fac i l i ta te the creation o f water users’ associations as pa r t o f 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the Water Code. Adm i t ted ly , economic sus ta inab i l i ty o f water-user 
associations i s a concern. Even though water f e e co l lec t ion rates are high (around 90%), 
the revenues cover o n l y around 30% o f the to ta l costs.

imp rove the know ledge base o n Ta j ik is tan has b e e n la rge ly met. The ana ly t ic materials 
have enriched the p o l i c y dialogue and have had some impac t th rough the B a n k operations 
and the IMF’s PGRF. A l t h o u g h the areas covered were highly relevant, l im i t e d a t ten t ion 
to the AAA w o r k by the Government, especially at the beginning o f the C A S period, 
handicapped p romp t implementation. L a c k o f d i rec t Government invo lvemen t in 
selection and preparation o f AAA has con t r ibu ted t o this lack o f attention. This s i tua t ion 
was exacerbated by the Bank’s inadequate focus o n dissemination and imp lemen ta t ion . 
Since the B a n k has produced a large b o d y o f ana ly t ic w o r k o f good qua l i ty , w h i c h

IV . LESSONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

66 . 
Ta j ik is tan continues t o face the dua l challenge o f ma in ta in ing the r a p i d pace o f 
economic g r ow t h and arresting the deterioration o f i t s basic services, w h i c h i s eating 
away the po ten t ia l f o r long - te rm g row th . The challenge l ies in channeling the l im i t e d 
in te rna l and ex te rna l resources t o k e y p r i o r i t y areas. The e f fec t ive u s e o f these l im i t e d 
resources, however, requ i res c l a r i t y o f objectives, good p ro jec t design, capacity t o 
implement, and coo rd ina t ion among a l l stakeholders. In each o f these areas, m u c h i s 
requ i red in Ta j ik is tan . The se lec t iv i ty and the effectiveness o f interventions continue t o 
be high p r io r i t ies , g iven the scope o f the recons t ruc t ion needs and the l im i t e d capacity t o 
m o b i l i z e resources in te rna l ly and externally. 

67 . 
The goals set in the FY03-05 CAS remain valid, but the approach needs 
adjusting. The long-terms goals o f fos te r ing p r iva te sector development, im p r o v i n g 
services t o people, and building ma rke t ins t i tu t ions rema in o f utmost importance in 
Ta j ik is tan . Howeve r , although progress has been made towards ach iev ing these goals, the 
commun i ty d r i v e n approach t o development has n o t taken r o o t as hoped f o r in pa r t because 
the Government and donors were s low t o come together behind i t . A mo re sector-oriented 
approach m a y b e needed to demonstrate the value o f engaging a l l l e v e l s o f government, 
communities, and donors in the p r o v i s i o n o f p u b l i c sector services. I t i s encouraging that 
the B a n k made a special e f fo r t to engage the government in a dialogue o n the key p r io r i t ies 
and approach when embarking o n the new C A S preparation. This has a l lowed fo r a clearer 
iden t i f ica t ion o f shared CAS goals and results f o r the nex t fou r years. 

68 . 

T o increase effectiveness, the CAS should select fewer outcomes and 
concentrate a l l its instruments to deliver these outcomes. G i v e n the capacity and 
recourse constraint faced by the Government and the B a n k in Tajikistan, the B a n k 
p rog ram should focus o n a highly selective se t o f outcomes. A t the same time i t shou ld 
ensu re that i t s instruments - po l icy , investment, TA, and commun i ty operations - a l l 
support the same outcomes. 

69 . 
To be realistic, the CAS should take into account the political economy 
considerations. The lack o f Government b u y - i n in some areas has delayed the 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the SAC2 and has affected the effectives o f ins t i tu t ion building and 
TA efforts. Tajikistan’s experience corroborates with the lessons f r om other L I C U S 
countries that in weak ins t i tu t iona l environments, development p o l i c y lend ing needs t o 
focus o n simple, p o l i t i c a l l y feasible re fo rms and be backed by sector-specific projects, 
capacity-building, and commun ica t ion campaigns. 

70 . 

Capacity constraints a re most effectively removed when (a) efforts a re targeted 
at meeting concrete objectives; (b) capacity building i s mainstreamed in investment 
operations and; (c) emphasis i s placed not only on the passage of legislation but also 
on its implementation. Limited capacity has affected the speed and effectiveness o f the 
C A S implementation. Fu tu re assistance shou ld focus o n r em o v i n g the capacity 
constraints. In this regard, capacity building shou ld no t be pursued in iso la t ion f i o m the 
r e f o rm program. I t should b e directed towards specific objectives and c lose ly linked t o 
p ro jec t implementation. In addition, i t i s impo r tan t to u s e ex is t ing government structures 

Attachment 2 
Page 20 o f 25 
rather than create new p ro jec t imp lemen ta t ion bodies. Shou ld the creation o f P I U be 
necessary, i t i s impo r tan t to ensure that their functions are fully mainstreamed i n t o the 
imp lemen t ing agency before the end o f the project. Lastly, the d e s i g n o f laws o r 
regulations shou ld be accompanied by concrete and realistic imp lemen ta t ion plans. 

7 1. 
F o r AAA to be effective, 
i t has to be programmatic, participatory and pay 
greater attention to implementation. The B a n k G roup should seek d i rec t government 
pa r t ic ipa t ion in selecting the areas and issues to be covered by the AAA, in ca r ry ing out 
the analysis, and in discussing p o l i c y imp l ica t ions and developing imp lemen ta t ion plans. 
In te rac t ion with government counterparts (the process) should receive the same l e v e l o f 
attention as the analytic w o r k (the product). Since a r i c h b o d y o f AAA has been recen t ly 
completed, the new C A S should concentrate o n i t s imp lemen ta t ion rather than creating 
n ew analytic wo rk . 

72. 
L o o k i n g ahead, the B a n k should seek t o p l a y the r o l e o f a catalyst t o m o b i l i z e 
add i t iona l resources in order t o achieve na t ionw ide scaling up in a resource constrained 
environment. The interventions financed under the p resen t C A S were des igned t o tes t 
new po l ic ies and approaches. However, t o m o v e f r om these p i l o t s to na t ionw ide 
coverage, the new IDA strategy w i l l have t o be mo re n a r r ow l y focused in t e r m s o f 
p r io r i t ies and w i l l have to find ways o f increasing the impac t o f donor and government 
resources under common strategies. To th is end, the B a n k G roup shou ld build o n i t s 
comparative advantage o f a know ledge i n s t i t u t i o n and help the Government develop 
sector r e f o rm p la t fo rms and build donor coa l i t ions around them. M o v i n g towards 
SWAPS and other forms o f donor partnerships and coalitions, should he lp in this regard.

Tajikistan’s med ium - te rm economic prospects are expected t o r em a i n b r o a d l y 
favorable during the FY06-09 CPS period. In the base case f o r th is period, rea l output i s 
p ro jec ted to g row at 8% in 2005, and subsequently stabilize at about 6-7% during 2006- 
09 (see Table below). The g r ow t h i s expected to come f rom : 

0 Con t inued strong i n f l ow s o f worker’s remittances. Remittances f r om Russia and 
some other countries are expected t o g row further. These broad-based remittances

pove r ty reduction. I t i s l i k e l y that remittances w i l l f u e l small-scale p r iva te sector

i n f l o w o f remittances inc lude a possible v isa regime in Russia and a down tu rn in 
Russia’s economy.

Increased and mo re e f fec t ive donor-funded pub l ic investment. In 2003, investment 
flows unde r t h e Pub l ic Investment P rog ram (PIP) were e v e n b e l ow t h e 3% o f GDP 
l i m i t agreed with the IMF. The l o w P IP investment leve ls o f the past we re la rge ly the 
r e s u l t o f Government’s limited absorption capacity, a l a c k o f counterpart funds, 
w h i c h delayed the disbursement o f funds already p ledged by donors, and sometimes 
donor-specific red tape and lack o f coordination. Government capacity has since 
increased somewhat, the debt situation has d rama t ica l ly improved, and there has b e e n 
progress in donor coordination. As a resu l t , i t i s l i k e l y that annual PIP leve ls can 
increase to 4.5% o f GDP. And as the p r io r i ty -se t t ing , planning, and execu t ion 
process o f p u b l i c investment imp roves in l i n e with the PRSP, the quan t i ty and the 
qua l i ty o f p u b l i c investment are expected t o increase. K e y r i s k s inc lude setbacks in 
specific p u b l i c sector re fo rms geared t o im p r o v i n g PIP p l a n n i n g and execu t ion and 
possible s h i f t s in donor p r io r i t ies .

to strengthen co t ton y ie lds and exports in the com ing years. Aluminum and 
e lec t r ic i ty exports are expected to rema in near present leve ls during the CPS period, 
but some large investment projects in this area might start t o materialize. Key r i s k s 
f o r export revenues inc lude p r ice deteriorations fo r co t ton o r a l um i n um and

6% a year. The f isca l surplus, exc lud ing PIP, i s expected t o tum i n t o a sma l l de f ic i t in 
2005, as p u b l i c expenditure increases in p r i o r i t y areas, and Ta j ik is tan bears t h e cost o f

Tajikistan 's ex tema l debt p r o f i l e has changed s ign i f ican t ly since Independence. 
S ta r t ing f r om zero debt stock in 1991, ex tema l debt accumulated during the nineties due 
t o the loss o f transfers f r om Russia, a d i f f i c u l t market t rans i t ion experience, p o l i t i c a l

To imp rove debt sustainability, the Government pursued various strategies. In 
1995, i t re f ra ined f r om issuing guarantees o n state-owned enterprise debt t o b i la te ra l

Assessmen ts in Low - Income Countries (L IC ) recen t ly approved by the Boa rds o n April 
12,2005. Howeve r , a j o i n t DSA, using the l o w income coun t ry framework, cannot be

The DSA ou t look under the base case scenario' appears favo rab le ove r the 
medium-term. Tajikistan 's long - te rm debt sus ta inab i l i ty begins t o im p r o v e o n l y after 
2006 when the NPV o f debt declines in re la t ion t o GDP, exports, and revenue. After a 
sharp increase in debt service associated with the debt-for-asset swap with Russia in 
2004, Ta j ik is tan 's debt service burden s ign i f ican t ly imp roves f r om 2005 onwards, 
re f lec t ing stable ratios o f debt service to exports and to revenue. Further, mos t o f these 
indicators rema in b e l ow the thresholds f o r weak p o l i c y L I C , except f o r the ra t io o f NPV 
to GDP . The latter slightly exceeds the threshold o f 30% due t o a p ro jec ted s low d ow n in 
GDP g r ow t h f r om 10.6% in 2004 t o 8 and 7% during 2005-06. A s imu la t ion also shows 
that the IDA grant has n o s ign i f ican t impac t o n the debt sus ta inab i l i ty as key debt

average o f 6.5% over the CPS period (2005-10). In f la t ion i s expected to stabilize at around 6% reflecting continued 
prudent management o f fiscal and monetary policies and a stable somoni. T h e Government w i l l l im i t its external 
borrowing t o finance public investment programs on concessional terms at about 4-5% o f GDP, and the overall fiscal 
deficit including PIP i s forecasted to increase to about 4.1% o f GDP. Continued strong in f lows o f workers' remittances 
w i l l contribute to a moderate current account deficit estimated at about 4-4.5% o f GDP over the projection period. T h e 
CPS envisages an annual I D A allocation o f 100% grant in the amount o f USS23 m i l l ion in FY06, and credit in 
subsequent fiscal years.

A sens i t iv i ty analysis indicates that Tajikistan’s debt sustainability i s vulnerable 
t o external shocks b u t s t i l l remains favorable over the med ium - te rm . The l o w case 
assumes that a n external shock associated with a sharp reduc t ion in the p r ices o f 
a lum inum and co t ton in 2005 and 2007 w i l l lowe r GDP g r ow t h t o an average o f 4% over 
the CPS pe r iod . B o t h the current account de f ic i t and f isca l de f ic i t are expected t o further 
widen compared to those o f the base case. The ra t ios o f NPV o f debt to GD P and 
revenue sha rp ly increase and exceed the thresholds o f 30 and 200% in 2006, respectively, 
but subsequently decline. The high case scenario envisages an accelerated g r ow t h o f 9% 
per annum, favorable prices o f a lum inum and co t ton and strong remittance i n f l ow s . 
Under this case, the current account de f ic i t i s expected t o f a l l and stabilize at a l ow e r 
l e v e l than that o f the base case, while the ove ra l l f isca l de f ic i t declines and tums i n t o a

In 2004, the B a n k prepared a Central A s i a Reg iona l F ramewo rk Paper, w h i c h l i s t e d 
several c r i t i c a l reg iona l cooperation areas such as trade and transport, wa te r and energy, and 
commun icab le diseases, as we l l as several thematic areas such as an t i -money laundering, 
education and b u s i n e s s development. The B a n k G roup i s supporting cooperation in these 
areas, p r im a r i l y th rough ana ly t ica l w o r k and conven ing ac t iv i t ies and th rough lending when 
conditions warrant. W h i l e the reg ion has considerable distance t o go o n the cooperation 
front, there are some encouraging indications o f progress.

In the area o f wa te r and energy, at the request o f fou r o f the Cen t ra l A s i a Presidents, 
the Bank i s deve lop ing a b luep r in t fo r a Water and Energy Conso r t ium as a basis f o r

O n communicable diseases, the B a n k has ca r r ied ou t reg iona l assessments o f the 
extent o f HIVIAIDS and TB in Central A s i a and has b e e n suppo r t ing an ac t ive reg iona l

Attachment 6: Country Financing Parameters 

1. 

The Coun t ry F inanc ing Parameters (CFPs) fo r Ta j ik is tan were f i r s t established in 
August 2004, and rev iewed during the preparation o f this CPS. Changes in the Bank’s 
f inanc ing c r i te r ia serve the purpose o f fac i l i ta t ing operations, accelerating disbursements 
and p ro jec t imp lemen ta t ion and thus timely achieving the development objectives. At 
present, the re are tw o projects w h i c h make u s e o f the CFPs: Educa t ion Mode rn iza t ion 
and C omm u n i t y Ag r icu l tu re and Watershed Management Projects. A l t h o u g h i t i s too 
ea r ly to assess the full impact, the i n i t i a l experience o f these tw o p ro jec ts shows that the 
added f l e x i b i l i t y contributed t o p roac t ive reso lu t ion o f m a n y imp lemen ta t ion - re la ted 
issues. 

2. 
Cost sharing. The u s e o f the new cost-sharing c r i te r ia w i l l h e l p make p ro jec t 
imp lemen ta t ion less complicated. The B a n k m a y finance up t o 100% o f i n d i v i d u a l 
p ro jec t costs. At the same time, coun t ry ownership o f i n d i v i d u a l p ro jec ts w o u l d continue 
t o b e key, and Government f inanc ing and pa r t ic ipa t ion o f other donors w i l l be 
encouraged. Measures to ensure ownership o f Bank - f inanced projects inc lude aspects 
such as in teg ra t ion o f the Bank projects in t h e Government’s Pub l ic Inves tmen t P rog ram 
(PIP), as well as use a l l o f the available instruments - b o t h Government and donor 
financed - t o support a shared sector strategy. In addition, the CPS i s p ropos ing to m o v e 
g radua l ly to S WAps, w h i c h shou ld he lp secure greater Government owne rsh ip . F ina l ly , 
the Bank and the Govemmen t started a process o f gradual ma ins t ream ing o f the P I U i n t o 
the relevant m i n i s t r i e s and agencies. 

3. 
The Bank’s f inanc ing share in i n d i v i d u a l projects w o u l d be d e t e rm i n e d by 
project-specific considerations, and i s expected to b e l ow t h e upper limit in mos t projects. 
As discussed in the CPS (see par. 60 and 78), the B a n k expects t o co f inance m a n y 
projects with other donors (e.g., M u n i c i p a l Infrastructure Project, C omm u n i t y and Bas ic 
Hea l th Project, Energy Loss Reduc t ion Project, and Lake Sarez Risk M i t i g a t i o n Project). 
In SWAPS (planned in the hea l th and education sectors) financed by Gove rnmen t and 
other donors, the Bank’s f inanc ing share i s t y p i c a l l y l ow . P ro jec t d e s i g n considerations 
in commun i ty - led development projects suggest that con t r ibu t ions f r om bene f ic ia r ies and 
l o c a l communities are generally expected in such projects (e.g., R u r a l In f ras t ruc tu re 
Rehab i l i ta t ion Project, C omm u n i t y A g r i c u l t u r e and Watershed Deve lopmen t Project, and 
L a n d Reg is t ra t ion and Cadastre System Project).

Recurrent cos t f inanc ing in the current p o r t f o l i o i s m a i n l y f o r p ro jec t operating 
costs; and go ing fo rwa rd i s expected t o continue to rema in at current modest levels. N o 
coun t ry - leve l limit i s se t o n recurrent cost financing, given the ove ra l l f isca l and debt 
situation. In determining recurrent cost f inanc ing in i n d i v i d u a l projects, the B a n k w o u l d 
take i n t o account sus ta inab i l i ty i s s u e s at the p ro jec t and sector l e v e l s . Fac to rs p r om o t i n g 
sustainability include: (i) the Bank’s approach o f s t ream l in ing PIUs i n t o execu t ing 
agencies; (ii) the current i n c l u s i o n o f recurrent expenditures i n t o the Budget as pa r t o f

state budget.

Loca l costfinancing. Government resources f r om taxes and expected domestic 
b o r r ow i n g are expected t o o n l y cover pa r t o f the ove ra l l development p rog ram 
requirements: 17% o f p lanned development investment i s proposed t o b e financed f r om 
Government’s o w n resources, and the rema in ing 83% are expected t o b e donor-financed’. 
The current p o r t f o l i o and pipeline includes projects in agriculture, i r r iga t ion , energy, 
water supply, and education and hea l th where a considerable p o r t i o n o f project-related 
i t em s are p rocu red loca l ly . A m a j o r i t y o f the B a n k investment lending disbursements in 
recent years have been f o r l o c a l costs (61% in F Y 0 3 and 66% in FY04). The f inanc ing o f 
fo re ign expenditures alone w i l l n o t enable the B a n k t o assist in f inanc ing o f i n d i v i d u a l 
projects. 

6. 
F inanc ing of taxes and duties. In general, the T a j i k taxes are n o t considered 
excessive and there i s cu r ren t ly n o d isc r im ina to ry adverse treatment o f Bank - f inanced 
projects. Customs duties range f r om 0 to 15%, but dono r - funded p u b l i c projects are 
exempt f r om the customs duties except fo r the customs adm in is t ra t ion f e e o f 0.15%. 
M a j o r taxes relevant in Bank - f inanced projects are p r o f i t tax o f 25%, personal income tax 
rang ing f r om 8% t o 13%, and VAT o f 20%. Social charges are 25% t o be p a i d by the 
employer and 1% by the employee. Projects that receive funding f r om in te rna t iona l 
f inanc ia l ins t i tu t ions are exempt f r om a number o f taxes and duties, mos t impo r tan t ly

This attachment presents (i) the resource imp l ica t ions in ach iev ing the MDG, (ii) a 
table o u t l i n i n g the MDG targets as they app ly to Tajikistan, (iii) the cu r ren t situation, (iv) 
prospects f o r ach iev ing the goals, and (v) the B a n k CPS instruments that w o u l d support 
these goals. This attachment draws extensively o n the U N D P Millennium Goals Needs 
Assessmen t Repo r t f o r Ta j ik is tan o f April 2005. 

2. 
MDG Costs: The to ta l estimated cost fo r ach iev ing the k e y MDGs targets by 
2015 in f o o d security, gender, education, health, and water and san i ta t ion i s in the order o f 
US$12.9 b i l l i o n . The annual per capita cost o f meeting the above MDGs targets i s in the 
order o f U S $ 1 19 in 2005, rising to US$183.2 in 20 15. The UNDP repo r t evaluates two 
scenarios: 

F inanc ing under the Baseline Reform Scenario assumes that there w i l l b e n o 
s ign i f ican t improvements in the economic, ins t i tu t iona l and s t ruc tu ra l 
environments o f the country; there w i l l be a modest increase in the government 
spending f o r f inanc ing MDG p r io r i t ies and the to ta l amount o f a i d remains 
unchanged over t ime . Unde r this scenario, (a) GD P g r ow t h stays at 5%; (b) the tax 
collections increase t o 19% as a share o f GDP by 2015, and (c) t h e government 
expenditure fo r MDG related investments remains at 3 1 % o f the t o t a l budget. 
Based o n these assumptions, the Government expenditures f o r cove r ing the MDG 
investments w i l l b e in the order o f US$1.5 b i l l i o n , o r 12% o f t o t a l MDG costs. 
The estimated to ta l p r iva te contributions w i l l b e in the order o f US$5 .7 b i l l i o n , or 
45% o f to ta l MDG costs, and the to ta l donor con t r ibu t ions w i l l b e in the order o f 
U S $ l . l b i l l ion , o r 9% o f to ta l MDG costs. In this case, the amoun t o f additional 
f inanc ing needed w i l l be in the order o f US$4.5 b i l l i o n , w h i c h i s 35% o f to ta l 
MDG costs. 

(ii) 

F inanc ing under the High Growth Scenario: The high g r ow t h scenario assumes 
acceleration o f the economic, ins t i tu t iona l and structural reforms, lead ing t o (a) 
GDP g r ow t h at 7% during 2007-2015,' (b) tax co l lec t ion as a share o f GDP 
increasing f r om the current l e v e l o f 15% t o 24% by 20 15; and (c) government 
rechannelling 50% o f the state expenditures i n t o f inanc ing MDG i n v e s tm e n t s by 
201 52 . Based o n these assumptions, the Government w i l l b e able t o release an 
add i t iona l US$2.3 b i l l i o n f o r the MDG investments, cove r ing US$3 .8 b i l l i o n , o r 
30% o f the to ta l MDG costs, assuming that p r iva te and dono r con t r ibu t ion stay at 
the same l e v e l as in the baseline scenario. In this case, the amoun t o f additional 
Pnancing needed w i l l b e in the order o f US$2 .0 b i l l i o n , o r 16% o f to ta l MDG 
costs. 

Under high reform scenario the projected GDP growth in 2005 i s 9%, in 2006 w i l l be 8% 
Assuming that the global market prices on cotton and aluminum remain favorable for Tajikistan

Attachment 9 : Key Partnerships 

1. 
Energy Sec to r . There are several successful partnerships in th is sector. The 
pub l ic -p r iva te partnership (PPP) f o r the Pam i r P r iva te Powe r Project, where the A g a 
K h a n Fund and I F C contributed US$11.5 m i l l i o n in equity, I F C con t r ibu ted an additional 
US$4.5 m i l l i o n in debt, complemented by an IDA f inanc ing ( th rough t h e Government) o f

amount o f US$18 m i l l i o n and SECO’s grant in the amount o f US $ 8 m i l l i o n . Moreover, 
the B a n k G roup i s w o r k i n g c lose ly with other impo r tan t p laye rs in this sector such as the 
ADB, w h i c h has comm i t ted US$61.7 m i l l i o n ’ to the sector, I s l am i c Deve lopmen t B a n k 
(IDB), w h i c h has comm i t ted US$17.3 m i l l i o n fo r the transmission o f rehab i l i ta t ion and

rehab i l i ta t ion o f the d is t r ibu t ion ne two rk in Dushanbe. The B a n k G roup w i l l seek to

2. 
Health. Partnerships have been a c r i t ica l part o f the hea l th sector r e f o rm process 
in Ta j ik is tan and the i r range and scope have increased subs tan t ia l ly in recent years. The 
US AID-funded ZdravPlus program, the Swiss-funded p ro jec t S ino and WHO programs 
have p layed an impo r tan t r o l e in conceptualizing and des ign ing the I D A ’ s C omm u n i t y 
Basic H e a l t h P ro jec t cu r ren t ly under preparation and has des igned the i r o w n programs t o 
complement the ac t iv i t ies proposed under this p ro jec t . In addition, the Swedish 
In tema t iona l Deve lopmen t Assoc ia t ion (S IDA ) has agreed t o p r o v i d e US$8 m i l l i o n in 
co f inanc ing f o r this p ro jec t and t o delegate p ro jec t management to the B a n k while s t i l l

th rough separate in i t ia t ives such as direct grants t o 1-2 N G O s t o help strengthen the 
primary hea l th care se rv ice de l ive ry in Tajikistan. These ac t iv i t ies w i l l be c lose ly linked 
to those anticipated under the IDA project. The B a n k and S I D A are also in discussions 
with WHOiEURO in Copenhagen and the DFID-WHO H e a l t h P o l i c y Ana lys is Project in

Educa t ion . In 2003, IDA, with the IMF’ support under PRGF, launched a new 
i n i t i a t i v e o n education sector reform, supported th rough the Educa t ion M o d e r n i z a t i o n 
P ro jec t and other assistance t o the M in is t r ies o f Finance and Education. ADB and GTZ 
later o n j o i n e d this in i t ia t ive with their support t o the development o f the N a t i o n a l 
Educa t ion Deve lopmen t F ramewo rk (NEDF), w h i l e U N I C E F and UNDP have been

Educa t ion Mode rn iza t ion Project, IDA, USAID, OSI, GTZ and AKF are c lose ly 
co l labo ra t ing in supporting the in t roduc t ion o f per capita funding t o schools in 5 p i l o t 
rayons; IDA, t h e British Council, OSI, and AKF are p r o v i d i n g support t o c u r r i c u l um 
modem iza t ion and textbook development, and UN ICEF , AKF and IDA are j o i n t l y 
assisting the Ministry o f Educa t ion o n the establishment o f a m o d em student assessment 
system. F o r example, KfW has given a grant o f US$6 .6 m i l l i o n t o implement t h e 
education and other social service projects in the K h a t l o n Oblast.

A t tachmen t 10: Discussions w i th C i v i l Society 

1. 
During the CPS preparation, the B a n k G roup ca r r ied ou t discussions with 
representatives o f c i v i l society organizations and the p r iva te sector. The purpose o f these 
discussions was to receive direct feedback f r om the beneficiaries o f the B a n k G roup 
projects, to discuss the lessons learnt f r om the current C A S implementation, and t o hear 
their views about the future r o l e o f the W o r l d B a n k G roup in Ta j ik is tan . The B a n k 
G roup team exp la ined the new results-based approach and discussed with the participants 
the proposed b r o a d CPS strategic objectives f o r the nex t fou r years . 

2. 

In general, participants we lcomed the results-based approach and agreed o n 
the b road t h r u s t s o f the Bank’s assistance in Ta j ik is tan . Participants have also 
appreciated the candidness and ob jec t iv i ty o f the CPS document and i t s approach o f 
helping the coun t ry to address i t s short- and long - te rm development challenges. The 
discussion focused on: (i) f iduc ia ry issues , (ii) mon i to r ing , eva lua t ion and 
coo rd ina t ion o f donor assistance, (iii) sustainability o f the Bank -suppo r ted 
interventions, (iv) PRSP implementation, (v) taxation, (vi) access and high cost o f 
p r iva te sector financing, and (vii) environmental aspects. A brief summa ry o n these 
issues i s p resen ted be low . 

3 . 
F iduc ia ry issues. The participants saw im p r o v e d f inanc ia l accoun tab i l i ty as a 
key area o f B a n k engagement. They we lcomed Bank -suppo r ted p u b l i c sector f inanc ia l 
accoun tab i l i ty measures, such as in t roduc t ion o f the p rac t ice o f IAS audits in the state 
owned enterprises l i k e T a dAZ . In addition, the participants we re pos i t ive about the u s e 
o f the sector-wide approach in future B a n k lending. Howeve r , they cautioned against 
using the government sys tems f o r channeling resources because o f the p rob lems w i th 
p u b l i c f inanc ia l accoun tab i l i ty and procurement sys tems as w e l l as weak government 
agencies’ capacity at cen t ra l and l o c a l levels. The B a n k G roup team i n f o rm e d the 
participants that i t w o u l d continue p a y i n g adequate a t ten t ion t o f inanc ia l accoun tab i l i ty 
and procurement issues , and that i t counted o n strengthening o f the c i v i l society 
oversight. 

4. 
Mon i to r ing , evaluation and coordination o f dono r assistance. Several 
participants raised the issue o f greater invo lvemen t o f t h e c i v i l society in p ro jec t 
preparation and implementation. In th is regard, participants po in ted ou t that: (i) 
sometimes donor projects were prepared w i t h o u t cons ide r ing the needs o f t h e 
beneficiaries; (ii) o f ten c i v i l society i s consulted f o r f o rm a l i t y purposes on ly ; and (iii) 
beneficiaries have l i t t l e o r n o say during imp lemen ta t ion .

I t was mentioned that c omm u n i t y pa r t ic ipa t ion i s o f c ruc ia l impo r tance in the 
rehab i l i ta t ion o f education fac i l i t ies in r u r a l areas, w h i c h are in a near-crisis cond i t ion . In 
particular, participants raised the i s s u e o f co r rup t ion and l o w q u a l i t y o f p ro jec t outputs 
because o f the lack o f accoun tab i l i ty by l o c a l authorities and p ro jec t contractors and 
inadequate invo lvemen t o f commun i t ies in some dono r projects. Some pa r t ic ipan ts fe l t 
that despite the elaborate procurement and f inanc ia l management procedures, co r rup t ion

i s s t i l l tak ing place, as demonstrated by the p o o r q u a l i t y and excessive cost o f 
rehab i l i ta ted o r constructed fac i l i t ies . 

6. 
Inadequate coo rd ina t ion o f donor ac t iv i t ies was another i s s u e po in ted ou t by the 
participants. They asked donor t o coordinate b e t t e r their activities. They comp la ined 
that the re we re cases when several donors, while w o r k i n g in the same commun i ty , 
propose d i f fe ren t approaches and support the establishment o f pa ra l le l community-based 
organizations, are s t i l l widespread. 

7 . 

The B a n k G roup team thanked the participants f o r the f rank discussion and 
stressed that i t w o u l d seek t o increase c i v i l society and bene f ic ia ry pa r t ic ipa t ion at a l l 
stages o f Bank-supported activities. On the i s s u e o f corruption, the B a n k G roup s tressed 
that i t takes any allegation o f co r rup t ion in B a n k projects very seriously and that i t has a 
special Department o f Ins t i tu t iona l In teg r i ty (INT) that focuses o n such matters. I t also 
men t ioned that the j o i n t Government/Bank A c t i o n P lan o n P o r t f o l i o Performance 
envisages conduc t ing technical audits in cases where there are doubts about the qua l i ty 
and actual cost o f p rocu red wo rks and goods. 

8. 
Sustainability o f Bank G r o u p P ro jec ts . Some participants questioned the 
sustainability o f B a n k supported interventions. They gave the example o f Parent-Teacher 
Associations (PTAs), w h i c h dissipate after the dono r p ro jec t ends, due t o the lack o f 
hnding and relevant regu la to ry basis. Ano the r example b rough t up during the discussion 
was the B l a c k B o o k t o b e held by a l l p r iva te bus inesses w h i c h was in t roduced by the 
Government in order to c om p l y w i t h the S AC 2 relevant cond i t iona l i ty . The purpose o f 
the B l a c k Books was to reduce the frequency o f inspections o f the p r iva te sector by the 
state con t ro l agencies. Howeve r , in the o p i n i o n o f the participants, i t has n o t led t o 
visible changes in the numbe r o r intrusiveness o f inspections. The B a n k G roup t e am 
agreed that p ro jec t sustainability i s o f pa r t icu la r importance, and men t ioned that one o f 
the rationales f o r in t roduc ing t h e results-based approach in CPSs was to make the Bank - 
supported interventions mo re rea l is t ic and sustainable. I t also men t ioned that the 
pa r t icu la r cases men t ioned above w i l l be re fe r red t o the relevant task teams. 

9 . 
P R S P Implementation. I t was po in ted ou t that some Government o f f ic ia ls , b o t h 
at the central and l o c a l levels, were p o o r l y i n f o rm e d o n the content o f PRSP. In addition, 
the PRSP i s no t su f f ic ien t ly taken i n t o account w h e n deve lop ing new na t iona l legislation, 
sector and reg iona l po l ic ies . Mo reove r , there i s very l i t t l e i n f o rm a t i o n and feedback 
available o n the imp lemen ta t ion progress and r e s u l t s . In this respect, the pa r t ic ipan ts 
we lcomed that t h e new CPS i s being based o n the PRSP as a w a y to re in fo rce i t . 

10. 
Some participants argued that the PRSP p rog ram has had l i t t l e impac t o n pove r ty 
reduction, w h i c h was due t o factors such as wo rke rs remittances, favorable t e r m s o f 
trade, and p o l i t i c a l stability. I t was also men t ioned that i t i s d i f f i c u l t t o measure the 
pove r ty impac t o f PRSP-oriented dono r - funded p ro jec ts in Ta j ik is tan . The B a n k G roup 
team men t ioned that the re was s t i l l m u c h r o o m f o r imp rovemen t in the imp lemen ta t ion 
and m o n i t o r i n g o f the PRSP and i t s l inkage t o the p u b l i c expenditures and in pa r t icu la r ly

Taxa t ion . The participants s t ressed that the current tax regulations and their 
imp lemen ta t ion have a negative impac t o n the p r iva te sector development, b o t h in u rban 
and r u r a l areas. Private sector representatives questioned the newly in t roduced single tax 
in agriculture. A representative o f a Jamoat ( ru ra l self-government body), w h i l e 
acknow ledg ing i t s advantages, such as increased transparency, l ow e r adm in is t ra t ive 
costs, better u s e o f ag r icu l tu ra l l a n d and possible increase in budget revenues, men t ioned 
that the re were clear disadvantages, such as unclear reasons f o r the m a n i f o l d increase o f 
the tax rate. This cou ld lead t o a massive loss o r sale o f land u s e rights by farmers and t o 
l a n d degradation in the long-term. Other participants men t ioned that the tax leg is la t ion 
does n o t p rov ide incentives t o entrepreneurs t o make capital investments. In addition, the 
n ew tax l aw does no t d i f fe ren t ia te between the non -p ro f i t and f o r p r o f i t organizations. 
The B a n k G roup informed the participants that i t w i l l continue adv is ing t h e government 
o n the best taxa t ion practices in order t o build a fa i r and conducive t o p r iva te sector 
development sys tem o f taxation. 

12. 
Access and H i g h Cost o f P r iva te Sector Financing. Am o n g t h e issues po in ted 
about by participants in this rega rd were: (i) lack o f f inanc ing f o r ma tu r i t ies greater than 
1 year; (ii) high interest rates w i th the in te rna t iona l organizations cha rg ing even higher 
i n t e r e s t rates than those charged by comme rc ia l banks; and (iii) cumbersome and rigid 
procedures fo r ob ta in ing financing. The B a n k G roup i n f o rm e d the pa r t ic ipan ts that the 
IFC , j o i n t l y with EBRD, have been w o r k i n g w i t h the banks t o build their capacity, 
im p r o v e the regu la to ry framework, and make available resources f o r lend ing . 

13. 
Env i ronmen t . The c i v i l society representatives stressed that p rese rv ing the 
environment i s a ma jo r long - te rm challenge. In view o f this, they stressed that t h e 
country’s development should b e env i ronmen ta l ly sustainable. Future poss ib le large 
energy and infrastructure projects and the industries, such as the a l um i n um sme l te r 
TadAZ , coupled w i th the country’s weak ins t i tu t iona l and regu la to ry f ramewo rk , pose 
considerable r i s k s f o r environment. In this respect, c i v i l society representatives asked fo r 
greater B a n k invo lvemen t in reso lv ing the country’s environment problems. The B a n k 
G roup responded that env i ronmen ta l issues w i l l continue t o be addressed in the context 
o f relevant Bank - f inanced projects.
